as novelist john mortimer would reflect the way 
some people reacted we might have been plotting to pinch the 
crown jewels by gathering to grouse about prime minister margaret 
thatchers policies 
all the author of paradise postponed and the rumpole tv 
series did was attend a soiree in june at the home of lady antonia 
fraser the historian the liberal literary set assembled there for 
a discussion of how to counter mrs thatchers plans to bury 
british socialism 
the reactions of some rightwing commentators illustrate the 
bilious tenor of political debate in this 10th year of the thatcher 
revolution 
intellectuals have never enjoyed the esteem in britain that 
their peers are accorded in france and germany 
british intellectuals tend to disguise themselves said 
patrick bateson provost of kings college cambridge 
in this case having poked their heads above ground at the 
fraser dinner they have come in for attacks ranging from the snide 
through the derisive to the downright belligerent 
common themes are these writers know nothing of politics they 
have become richer in the thatcher years they are champagne 
socialists out of touch with the masses they claim to defend and 
other regimes would put them in jail 
the sunday telegraph headlined the betrayal of the 
intellectuals and its editor peregrine worsthorne got even more 
personal 
writing in the conservative weekly spectator worsthorne 
questioned the propriety of lady antonia holding her do in the room 
once used for conservative gatherings by her first husband the 
late sir hugh fraser whom she left for playwright harold pinter 
writer paul bailey argued in the centrist independent newspaper 
that lady antonia and co had been enriched by mrs thatchers tax 
cuts he found comic appeal in their concern for the poor 
dj taylor wrote in the conservative evening standard that it 
was an antithatcherite cabal and a rather dangerous joke 
then shot himself in the foot by deriding the group for lacking 
such highcaliber writers such as ian mcewan and salman rushdie 
both of whom were indeed present 
lady antonias dinner was not the only stirring of organized 
intellectual dissent centerleft academics formed a think tank 
last month devoted to challenging thatcherite doctrine 
the right have managed to persuade the public of a range of 
myths that need to be exploded said baroness tessa blackstone 
head of the socialistoriented birkbeck college in london and of 
the new institute for policy research 
among the myths she named at a news conference the free 
market is sacrosanct inequality is essential to a prosperous 
society all nationalized industry is bad and to manifest social 
concern is to be wet mrs thatchers term for bleedingheart 
liberalism 
the catalyst of the intellectual ferment was mrs thatchers 
third successive election victory in june 1987 unprecedented in 
britains modern times 
she considers it a mandate to implement her most radical reforms 
and has launched a program ranging from revamping the state health 
education and welfare systems to curbing promotion of homosexuality 
in rolling back the liberal legacy of the 1960s mrs thatcher 
seems to be borrowing an old slogan of her friend ronald reagan 
you aint seen nothin yet 
lady antonia said all this motivated her to invite mortimer 
novelist margaret drabble feminist guru germaine greer and other 
eminent figures to dinner 
we were talking about the way society was going she told 
the conservative sunday times clause 28 on homosexuality the 
cuts in welfare people sleeping rough in the streets we 
said so many people must be talking like this and can we do 
anything if we try at least we can tell our grandchildren that we 
tried 
rushdie author of midnights children called it our 
first hesitant efforts to join forces against the present 
regime in an article for the liberal weekly observer he added 
im damned if ill be apologetic 
such intellectual stirrings are but a pinprick for mrs thatcher 
at this stage because the economy is strong and unemployment is 
falling a sunday times poll indicated 74 percent of britons are at 
least fairly satisfied with their lot and 62 percent support her 
economic policies

faisal husseini a top proplo activist jailed 
by israel has emerged as a local leader respected by dovish 
israelis for his willingness to negotiate directly with the jewish 
state 
husseini has a keen sense of realism and in this case 
realism means compromise said moshe amirav who was kicked out 
of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc after 
holding secret talks with husseini last year 
the softspoken 48yearold husseini was arrested sunday and 
ordered held without trial for six months he has already served 12 
months in prison under two similar sentences 
one period of arrest began in september 1987 shortly after 
husseinis talks with amirav were revealed the latest arrest came 
just days after he told an israeli audience in a rare public 
dialogue that he endorsed direct talks with israeli leaders 
including hardliner shamir 
it was seen as an effort by israel to prevent the expansion of 
palestine liberation organization activities following the decision 
by king hussein of jordan to sever his nations legal and 
administrative ties with the occupied west bank 
us officials and israeli liberals condemned husseinis arrest 
saying israel should encourage palestinians who seek accommodation 
with israel 
if i were prime minister i wouldnt have put him in jail i 
would have said to him lets sit down and talk business said 
amirav 
in the hague the dutch government tuesday pressed for 
husseinis early release a foreign ministry spokesman said 
speaking anonymously in line with ministry practice 
he said roving ambassador henk vijverberg told israeli 
ambassador zev sufott during a routine meeting that the netherlands 
was concerned about the detention and that it jeopardized 
possible dialogue between the israeli government and moderate 
palestinians 
the spokesman noted that foreign minister hans van den broek met 
with husseini and other palestinian representatives during an 
official visit to israel last month 
the israeli newspaper davar described husseini as an important 
potential negotiating partner and said he would be a contender for 
the job of prime minister in a future palestinian state 
if the partner for dialogue is not going to be a hashemite 
ruler like hussein it will be a palestinian personality like 
husseini said davar which is close to the leftofcenter labor 
party 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has described husseini as the top 
plo official in the occupied territories and has accused him of 
agitating against israel 
husseini is a scion of one of the largest and most powerful 
palestinian clans 
his great uncle was haj amin el husseini the fiercely 
antijewish mufti of jerusalem who served as president of the 
supreme moslem council in palestine from 1920 to 1944 
faisal husseinis father abdel khader husseini commanded arab 
forces in jerusalem in the 1948 middle east war he was killed in 
the fighting 
as a young man husseini studied at a military college in 
damascus syria and became an xray technician he later developed 
a love for history and studied the subject for two years in 
beirut lebanon in the 1970s 
but husseini had to break off his studies when israeli officials 
placed him under town arrest in jerusalem from 1981 to 1987 
forbidding him from leaving the city limits and confining him to 
his home from sundown to sunrise 
he was accused of subversive activites but not put on trial 
police said after husseinis arrest sunday that he had renewed 
subversive hostile activities including coordination and 
incitement of the 8monthold arab uprising in the occupied lands 
police also closed husseinis arab studies institute for one 
year charging it was controlled and financed by the plo and served 
as a meeting place for plo activists 
staff members said the institute was funded by international 
grants and provided information about the palestinian people and 
its history 
four days before his latest arrest husseini participated in a 
public dialogue with dovish israelis fielding tough questions from 
some participants and winning applause for his answers 
asked whether palestinians would be satisfied with a state 
alongside israel and not use it as a stepping stone to capturing 
all of israel he said 
indeed i do have a dream but just as i am not willing to let 
others impose their dreams upon me i am not willing to impose my 
dreams on my fellow men 
husseinis wife najat said she believes her husband was 
arrested because of his dialogue with israeli peace activists 
whenever he speaks about peace they put him in prison mrs 
husseini said

israel may hold the mortgage but jordan has 
millions of dollars on deposit in the occupied west bank 
although jordan is officially at war with israel the arab 
nation has nevertheless bankrolled palestinian jobs and education 
in the disputed territory for more than two decades 
this odd relationship appears likely to change now that king 
hussein has announced he will sever legal and administrative ties 
with the west bank 
hussein so far has declined to be specific about what links 
would be eliminated but palestinians fear a key lifeline to the 
outside world could be cut off if he cancels passports held by most 
of the west banks 850000 palestinians or closes the allenby 
bridge linking the west bank to jordan 
hussein whose grandfather united the east and west banks of the 
jordan river in 1950 sends up to 200 million annually to the west 
bank and east jerusalem for hospitals islamic institutions 
agriculture and education according to yasser obeid the director 
of the west banks arab health center 
the money covers salaries to 21000 former jordanian government 
officials lawyers who went on strike after the 1967 occupation 
and palestinian teachers 
in addition jordan has contributed 12 million annually to the 
wakf or moslem religious council which oversees jerusalems 
landmark al aqsa and dome of the rock mosques 
palestinians in west bank and east jerusalem classrooms study 
jordanian textbooks and college qualification examinations are 
sent across the allenby bridge from amman 
the jordanian dinar is the main form of currency in the west 
bank and the cairoamman bank opened a branch two years ago in 
nablus the west banks largest city since then palestinians have 
deposited 45 million into the bank 
despite husseins move to distance his kingdom from the 
israeliheld territory obeid predicted jordan still would wield 
influence in the west bank 
we palestinians and jordanians are one people and the 
relationship between us will not change he said in an interview 
hussein provided funding not to win hearts but because he felt 
obliged to support our people under occupation 
amin majaj one of 30 palestinians who lost their jordanian 
parliament seats this week when hussein dissolved the lower house 
disagrees 
its very likely hussein will lose influence in the west bank 
just think of the institutions and employees who depend on jordan 
what about them majaj an east jerusalem doctor said in an 
interview 
in announcing his intention to bow out of the west bank hussein 
apparently intended to send a message to the palestine liberation 
organization that he would not take their place at a table to 
negotiate middle east peace as israel has suggested 
the israeli proposal is based on the usbrokered 1978 camp 
david agreement between israel and egypt which included a 
prominent role for jordan in negotiating the future of the occupied 
territories 
one israeli official told the associated press that while 
apparently pulling back from an active role in negotiations 
hussein also is telling the plo remember there are things i 
can do for the palestinians that you cant do i have quite a lot 
of clout 
hussein just has to be careful not to go too far because 70 
percent of his own people are palestinians and he doesnt need any 
trouble from them the official said on condition of anonymity 
hanna siniora proplo editor of the east jerusalem daily 
newspaper al fajr predicted hussein would benefit from his 
decision to loosen his hold on the west bank 
jordan will gain a new relationship with the palestinians 
based on respect for their national rights he told the ap 
most israeli officials say privately they doubt hussein will 
take drastic steps such as closing the bridges between jordan and 
the west bank that palestinians rely on for business and as their 
main link with the arab world 
what has happened up to now is mainly symbolic and doesnt 
have a real effect on the daily life in the west bank said an 
israeli diplomatic source in our assessment he might take 
another step or two but will stop short of taking drastic steps 
in one step staterun jordan television canceled weather 
reports and a palestinian program for the occupied territories the 
televisions news editor said tuesday from amman 
however the editor alfred asfoor said the programs might be 
aired again in the future

researchers at the oak ridge national 
laboratory have found what atomic theorists said shouldnt exist a 
stable ion of calcium 
this was a surprise university of tennessee physicist david 
j pegg one of the researchers said tuesday 
there is no immediate direct application but the information 
may be used as a building block pegg said if nobody cared 
about the structure of atoms we wouldnt have lasers or transistors 
or anything like that 
the findings were included in a fourpage report in physics 
today a journal of the american physical society and in physical 
review letters science news and a british publication called the 
new scientist 
atoms are usually electrically neutral because they have the 
same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged 
electrons an ion is an atom or group of atoms with an electrical 
charge 
theory held that calcium along with barium strontium and other 
elements in a series known as alkaline earths should not be able 
to hold a negative charge pegg said the theory was that the atoms 
would automatically discharge any extra electron they picked up 
ridding themselves of the negative charge 
pegg and his assistant ut graduate student jeffrey thompson 
along with oak ridge scientists robert compton and gerald alton 
decided to test the theory 
to their surprise they found that when they added an electron to 
a calcium atom the electron stayed there giving the atom a 
negative charge 
so we then said perhaps the theorists are wrong pegg 
said 
the next step was to see if they could knock the electron off 
the atom since it wouldnt leave of its own accord 
using a laser beam the researchers found that they could knock 
the electron off and concluded the ion was stable pegg said 
studying the stability of negative calcium ions is something 
that required the most modern equipment pegg said particularly 
the cray supercomputer at vanderbilt university 
somebody may have tried to do this in the 1960s for instance 
and couldnt he said

two counts of firstdegree murder each the two also were convicted 
of aiding and abetting and use of a firearm in a crime

verdicts on cly and bedoni but was unable to reach a verdict on 
the third defendant ben atene jr 24 us district judge j 
thomas greene declared a mistrial and ordered atene returned to the 
salt lake county jail where he is being held without bail

they were elsewhere

a man who died clutching a 52000 
check at a bank had lived as a pauper despite a large stash of 
money in numerous accounts authorities said 
edward joseph richer 58 collapsed and died of a heart attack 
while opening an account at empire of america federal savings bank 
on june 10 police have since been unraveling his secret life 
it was pretty unusual unfolding two lives of an unknown 
entity detective steve labbitt said tuesday ive narrowed it 
down to defrauding federal and state welfare agencies 
richer had been receiving 575 monthly in social security 
disability payments since december 1986 under his name and that of 
ernest helmut cords labbitt said cords was a falsified identity 
authorities said 
when he died richer was holding a 52600 check made out to 
cords in addition to his own drivers license credit cards and 
bank cards a second wallet contained identification for cords 
also 58 
a halfdozen sizeable accounts opened in the names of richer 
and cords at banks in los angeles and orange counties put his 
wealth at about 250000 said labbitt 
neighbors were shocked about the secret accounts 
he was in dire straits always just scraping by said john 
arciero richers next door neighbor of 13 years in venice 
richer lived a poor mans life dressing in old clothes and 
collecting food and goods behind neighborhood markets in an effort 
to sell them and make a few extra bucks they said 
the address on richers bogus drivers license was a rented 
postal box in suburban venice the 52600 check a federal voucher 
issued after a recent savings and loan failure carried the address 
of a santa monica post office box 
labbitt said richers son barnaby was located through a 
telephone number found in the dead mans wallet the younger richer 
identified his fathers body but said hed never heard of ernest 
helmut cords 
labbitt said the mans double identity was either an elaborate 
scheme to avoid taxes or maybe he just liked to see his accounts 
grow and make people think he wasnt wealthy 
the case has been turned over to state welfare officials the 
officer said

inmates who took five guards hostage at a 
maximumsecurity prison for more than 14 hours were angry kids 
who really didnt know what they were getting into according to 
the state prisons chief 
the small group of prisoners who took control of the 32inmate 
special disciplinary housing unit at coxsackie correctional 
facility on monday released the last four of the five injured 
guards early tuesday 
i think they got tired said state corrections commissioner 
thomas coughlin of the inmatess surrender 
i think they felt very strongly that they were in over their 
heads after the initial assaults we just sat back and waited 
and kept talking to them and kept giving them their options 
coughlin said the ordeal was 15 hours of terror for the 
guards some of who were apparently beaten two were hospitalized 
in good condition tuesday three others were treated and released 
for minor injuries one inmate received minor injuries in the 
takeover 
coughlin and gov mario cuomo told news conference they believed 
the takeover was an unorganized chain of events that might have 
been triggered by the heat temperatures on monday were in the 90s 
what were dealing with is a mob coughlin said it was a 
bunch of young kids acting as a committee of 32 there was no 
planning there was no organization they knocked an officer down 
they took two other officers nightsticks and they said oh my 
god look what weve done now 
the inmates were armed with nightsticks but didnt have 
homemade knives as some believed monday coughlin said 
according to state corrections department records the oldest 
inmate in the unit is 26 years old and most of the prisoners are in 
their upper teens or early 20s 
outside the prison monday guard ralph scott had said inmates 
had been warning for weeks that there might be trouble but 
coughlin said tuesday that none of the usually reliable trouble 
signs were evident at the prison which has 951 inmates and is 20 
miles south of albany 
the indicators that i judge were not there coughlin said 
sure people were saying it was getting tense prisons are tense 
in hot weather 
corrections department spokesman james flateau said monday that 
some inmates had been complaining about verbal harassment by 
guards but cuomo said tuesday the uprising was not a response to 
any harassment 
cuomo and coughlin said there were no demands made during the 
daylong negotiations which were mostly between two inmates and 
prison superintendent john twomey cuomo said the inmates had only 
requested that they not be beaten up when they released their 
hostages 
all the inmates remained locked in their cells tuesday flateau 
said investigators still havent determined how many of the 32 
inmates were involved in the uprising and no charges have been 
filed yet coughlin said 
the uprising was the longest at a new york state prison since 
inmates at sing sing held 17 guards hostage for 2 days in january 
1983

tuesday night said pritchard he said he didnt know how serious 
the blaze was or when it might be controlled 
the entire crew of about 3000 was probably engaged in the 
firefighting efforts the spokesman said 
this is an allhands evolution he said 
the fire in one of the constellations four engine rooms started 
about 1210 pm when the ship was about four miles off the coast 
of san diego 
they contained the fire within minutes however the fire did 
reflash in midafternoon pritchard said 
initial reports indicated the fire had been contained within the 
engine room he said 
the ship is currently under way with her own power heading 
away from the coast pritchard said we dont have an exact 
position for her 
asked if the ship would return to port pritchard said its 
too early to tell thats going to have to wait until we get an 
exact assessment of damage the no 1 concern right now is to get 
the fire out

fire smothering systems 
the federal aviation administration imposed a 5mile air space 
restriction around the burning ship about 410 pm pritchard said

vice president george bush says he may be a 
nice wasp but hes closer to ethnic voters than michael dukakis 
on school prayer the death penalty and other valueladen issues 
he can speak spanish but i can speak our language of ethnic 
values and pride everlasting pride in the united states of 
america bush told 200 supporters tuesday evening at a rally for 
ethnic groups 
bush said he respected dukakis the son of greek immigrants for 
his pride and his ethnicity but bush portrayed the democratic 
nominee as out of step with the patriotic and lawandorder values 
of most ethnic americans 
to any who wonder how a nice wasp like himself fits in with 
ethnic voters bush said well its values 
the vice president addressed the bush 88 coalition of american 
nationalities after returning from chicago where he outlined his 
foreign policies ideas in a speech before the midamerica committee 
he told that civic group he aims to deploy a spacebased defense 
shield as soon as feasible and promised as president i will 
not leave america defenseless against ballistic missiles 
bush also was planning to highlight defense issues today with a 
tour of a westinghouse defense plant in annapolis md 
but bush was hoping to put the issue of plant closing 
legislation behind him his chief of staff craig fuller told 
reporters that president reagans decision not to veto a 
plantclosing notification bill should stifle democratic attempts 
to keep making political hay on that issue 
bush said he was more interested in talking about plant openings 
and record numbers of americans in the work force than about plant 
closings 
at the ethnic rally a banner hung from the national press club 
balcony bearing the names of the irish and italians germans and 
japanese cossacks and croats and nearly a score of other groups 
it said bush in 1988 he speaks our language 
taking a cue from the banner bush said were talking one 
language and were talking values that join all of us together 
i dont think its wrong for a kid to say a prayer on a 
voluntary basis in school i think its right he said 
and i think some crimes are so heinous so outrageous 
particularly those that cause the death of police officers and are 
caused by these drug addicts that the death penalty is 
warranted he said 
it isnt right to let murderers who havent served enough time 
to be eligible for parole out on some furlough so they can rape and 
murder again bush said referring to the highly publicized 
massachusetts program under dukakis that has since been amended 
if somebody ever brings me a bill to require teachers to say 
the pledge of allegiance to our flag one nation under god in our 
schools ill sign it and ill sign it fast and my opponent 
vetoed it he said 
without mentioning the recent us downing of an iranian 
commercial airliner in the persian gulf bush said ill never 
apologize for the united states of america ever i dont care what 
the facts are 
in chicago bush also said that while he will pursue arms 
controls talks with the soviet union he will approach the table 
warily and avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and 
exaggerated pessimism 
we should not let our hopes outrun our practical experience 
said bush who added he was impressed by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs call for openness and reforms but he said the soviet 
union must be judged by what it delivers on human rights arms 
cuts and reining in aggressive soviet clients 
bush suggested that development of the administrations 
strategic defense initiative also known as star wars might be 
critical to israels security 
and while praising the reagan administrations support for the 
mujahedeen rebels in afghanistan and the liberation of grenada he 
made no mention of the contra rebels in nicaragua

republicans have done just about everything 
but pin an im a contra too button on texas sen lloyd 
bentsen to draw attention to the democratic vice presidential 
nominees support for aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
seeking to exploit the split on the contra aid issue between 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and his running 
mate gop leaders have jumped at the opportunity to spotlight 
bentsens views on the emotional subject 
unlike bentsen dukakis has called contra aid a failed and 
illegal policy that ought to stop dukakis says bentsens 
views dont bother him however 
president reagan who coined the im a contra too phrase 
and routinely stings democrats in his weekly radio address had 
nothing but praise for bentsens past record on contra aid last 
saturday he called bentsen one of the strongest supporters of 
assistance for the rebels 
and senate minority leader bob dole rkan on tuesday quoted 
from a speech bentsen delivered on feb 4 1988 in which the texan 
called the sandinistas violent revolutionaries men and women 
who are dedicated to spreading their brand of communism anywhere 
they can reach 
i can only hope that michael dukakis and every other american 
republican independent and democrat is listening too said 
dole author of a 47 million aid proposal for the nicaraguan 
contras seeking to oust the sandinista regime the package which 
includes a 20 million escrow account for military aid is pending 
in the senate 
on tuesday bentsen said he would vote for a program that 
provides humanitarian aid to the contras as well as fenced 
military aid dependent on aggressive actions by the sandinistas 
both dukakis and bentsen say they support a floundering regional 
peace plan advanced a year ago by costa rican president oscar arias 
the contras currently are receiving 17 million in assistance 
for food clothing shelter and medical supplies that money 
expires at the end of september 
neither dukakis nor bentsen has shied away from talking about 
their positions on contra aid but some experts say the democratic 
candidates divergence on the issue could put them in a ticklish 
spot 
bentsen for instance is under pressure from liberal groups to 
oppose contra aid 
a bentsen yes vote on contra aid will alienate millions of 
democratic voters who care deeply about the central american issue 
and bring into question governor dukakis sincerity about changing 
central american policy the council on hemispheric affairs said 
in a statement the group does research and releases policy papers 
this is going to be a real window into the dukakisbentsen 
relationship the first sign of what the nature of their 
relationship is said jay winik a congressional fellow at the 
center for strategic and international studies a washington think 
tank 
how the democrats handle the issue could provide clues into 
whether bentsen as vice president would help shape foreign policy 
or remain in the background in a dukakis administration said 
winik a former aide to rep les aspin dwis 
the socalled reagan democrats those whom dukakis hoped to 
bring back into the party fold with his selection of a conservative 
democratic running mate will watch bentsens actions closely he 
said 
aside from trying to take advantage of the dukakisbentsen 
split republicans are confident the contra aid issue gives them a 
domestic political advantage at a time the sandinistas have 
resorted to repressive tactics said richard viguerie a 
conservative fundraiser 
in recent months the sandinistas have arrested opposition 
leaders closed an opposition newspaper and a roman catholic church 
radio station and expelled the american ambassador 
there is no mileage for the democrats on the contras 
viguerie said democrats have lost more elections on the 
softoncommunism thing than anything else 
john burnstein an associate at the washington office on latin 
america a liberal group that is against aid agrees the democrats 
would be best served by keeping the issue off the front burner 
which is not going to be easy 
if the united states agrees to send military aid you are just 
going to keep the thing on the front page he said 
democrats are aware that the issue is politically explosive in 
an effort to diffuse the charged atmosphere a group of a dozen or 
so senate democrats led by majority leader robert byrd dwva 
are working to devise an aid package that could attract bipartisan 
support

president reagan giving up a fight that had 
become an political tar baby for republicans is allowing to 
become law federally mandated advance notices for workers who lose 
their jobs to plant closings or large layoffs 
reagan who earlier this year had vigorously opposed such a 
measure said tuesday he would neither sign nor veto the required 
60day notices that both the house and senate passed last month 
with vetoproof twothirds majorities 
instead reagan said he will allow to become law on thursday 
without his signature what he called bad legislation from a 
congress more interested in scoring points with organized labor 
than in saving workers jobs 
reagan had vetoed a massive overhauling of the nations trade 
laws in may almost solely because it included the layoff notices 
calling them anticompetitive 
in a statement tuesday he said his view of them has not changed 
but conceded that democrats and unions had succeeded in raising so 
much public sentiment in favor of the legislation that the chances 
of republicans in congress sustaining a veto were virtually nil 
in order to end these political shenanigans and to get on with 
the business of the nation i have decided to allow the 
plantclosing bill to become law but without my signature he 
said 
a bureau of labor statistics study last year indicated that 64 
percent of the 15 million to 2 million workers who become victims 
of a large layoffs or plants closings receive no notice 
sponsors of the law estimated that had the law been enacted two 
years ago notices would have gone to some 16 million laidoff 
workers who otherwise did not get them 
republican lawmakers who had led the administrations fight 
against the notices in congress breathed a sigh of relief at 
reagans decision as did aides to vice president george bush who 
is running for president 
the battle is over and we ought to move on to the next 
issue said house republican whip trent lott of mississippi who 
is in a race this fall to succeed retiring sen john stennis 
dmiss 
sen john danforth rmo said the administrations adamant 
opposition to the notices and refusal to accept a weakened version 
of the measure when it was offered as a compromise last spring 
was a political mistake 
this issue has been a tar baby as far as republicans are 
concerned danforth said most people in the country did not 
agree with the presidents position 
bush has never waivered in opposing the mandatory notices 
despite repeated assertions by democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis that opposition to them reflects an insensitivity 
to workers and polls showing that more than 80 percent of the 
public favor the warnings 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said reagans decision 
will make it more difficult for the political game to be played 
over the plantclosing issue in the november election 
however texas sen lloyd bentsen dukakis running mate and the 
architect of the second showdown with reagan on the issue said 
democrats have no intention of letting bush off the hook 
plant closing is going to remain a very strong issue and it 
shows the difference that we are for fairness in this bentsen 
said 
the bill becomes law at 1201 am edt thursday but it will not 
be enforced until feb 4 1989 
under the bill notices are required of any employer with at 
least 100 fulltime workers if a plant closing will result in loss 
of jobs for 50 or more of employees 
in case of layoffs notices are required only if onethird of a 
companys employees or 500 of them whichever figure is lower 
are involved 
exemptions are provided if employers can show that plant 
closings or mass layoffs are caused by not reasonably foreseeable 
circumstances such as flood or sudden cancellation of a major 
contract or if the notices would prevent raising enough capital to 
keep the business open 
a veto became untenable when republicans deserted reagan 
apparently due to the public popularity of the plantclosing 
notices 
fiftyfour of the 177 republicans in the house and 19 of the 46 
gop senators supported the bill last month enough to muster the 
twothirds majorities in each chamber to override a veto 
the bills enactment is organized labors biggest legislative 
victory since 1978 when congress last voted to raise the minimum 
wage 
workers their families and their communities will now have a 
better chance to plan for the future said aflcio president lane 
kirkland 
the national association of manufacturers and the us chamber 
of commerce had engaged in aggressive grassroots lobbying over the 
past two weeks to pressure reagan to veto the bill both had 
expected him to veto it 
this has really sent a shock wave through the business 
community said renee reymond the nams chief lobbyist on the 
issue

here at a glance are major provisions of the 
bill providing for 60 days advance notice of plant closings and 
mass layoffs congress passed the measure last month and president 
reagan announced tuesday he will allow it to become law without his 
signature 
the prospective law 
will take effect thursday although companies will not have to 
start providing the notices until feb 4 1989 six months after 
enactment written notices have to be provided to affected workers 
individually and local government officials meantime the labor 
department is instructed to issue regulations for enforcing the 
statute 
affects only companies with 100 or more fulltime workers at 
any single site of employment 
in instances of plant closings which include shutdowns of any 
single product line or operation within a plant requires 60 days 
advance notice if 50 or more workers lose their jobs 
in cases of layoffs requires notice only if onethird of a 
plants work force or at least 500 people whichever is less are 
being laid off for example a company with 750 employees at a 
particular location laying off 200 of them would not have to 
provide the notices but if it laid off more than 250 it would so 
would a plant with 2500 employees that lays off 550 of them even 
though the reduction does not total onethird of its work force 
exempts companies from providing the full 60 days notice if 
the plant closing or layoff was caused by not reasonably 
foreseeable circumstances such as sudden cancellation of a 
government contract floods or droughts 
exempts companies from providing advance notice if the notices 
would have precluded them from obtaining capital or new business 
that would have enabled them to avoid or postpone the plant closing 
or layoffs 
there is a presumptive requirement to provide notices if 
companies are involved in bankruptcy court reorganizations or 
situations where creditors are trying to seize their assets only 
by showing the unforeseen circumstances would they be exempted 
authorizes the labor department to require violators to award 
up to 60 days back pay and benefits to any worker not given proper 
notice 
authorizes federal judges to levy fines of up to 500 per day 
for each of the 60 days that advance notice was not provided or up 
to 30000 which is to be paid affected communities 
the bills sponsors said it would have covered about 800000 
workers in each of the past two years who were laid off without 
warning

a state grand jury tuesday indicted noah 
robinson the halfbrother of jesse jackson on charges of 
conspiracy obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness in 
a plot to kill a murder witness 
the indictments were returned in greenville tuesday nearly two 
months after robinson and a former employee jake h oliver were 
arrested oliver also was indicted 
robinson said in a statement released tuesday that the 
government has been ordered to return part of 21000 in cash 
seized in june from his chicago apartment and offices 
the selfdescribed millionaire described the seizure as being 
part of a massive dirty tricks campaign against him by the 
government he said these people will never break my spirit or 
my resolve to oppose and expose their dirty tricks 
although robinson and jackson share relatives in greenville the 
former democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no 
recent contact with his halfbrother 
a trial date has not been set 
robinson and oliver were charged in june in a plot to kill 
janice rosemond 
ms rosemond testified last fall before a chicago grand jury 
which was inquiring into the activities of chicagos el rukn street 
gang ms rosemond reportedly told the grand jury that she saw the 
fatal shooting of leroy hambone barber 
within weeks of her testimony ms rosemond was attacked in her 
greenville apartment she survived five stab wounds 
shortly after the stabbing police issued an arrest warrant 
charging freddie elwood sweeney who once worked as a janitor in 
one of robinsons companies with assault and battery with intent 
to kill 
robinson maintains he had nothing to do with barbers death or 
ms rosemonds stabbing and said he is the victim of a massive 
governmentsponsored conspiracy 
robinson said the seizure of 21000 from his apartments and 
offices was a classic case of abuse of governmental power 
following robinsons arrest in greenville authorities searched 
robinsons apartment and offices and confiscated the cash and 
various corporate records the internal revenue service 
subsequently filed a 31000 lien against the cash and 12000 in 
one of robinsons bank accounts 
a judge ordered last wednesday that the seized cash and money 
from the bank account satisfied the irss claim and that the 
remaining 2000 should be returned 
in the order the judge said the government does not contest 
robinsons assertions that the money is free of criminal taint 
robinson said the government made up a debt in a futile attempt 
to justify keeping my money

a 421 million emergency spending bill is 
awaiting approval by the senate but the measure seems to be 
turning into a pawn in the electionyear struggle over aid to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
the senate appropriations committee sent the supplemental 
spending bill for fiscal 1988 to the full senate on tuesday by a 
voice vote without objections 
the senate was expected to vote on the measure as early as 
today however maneuvering between democrats and republicans over 
contra aid made the timetable unclear 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan has proposed a 47 
million contra aid package and has said he wants to attach it to 
the supplemental spending measure 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said he would not 
bring up the supplemental package if dole will introduce a contra 
aid amendment democrats are trying to write a milder formula for 
contra aid which they want to insert into a pentagon 
appropriations bill 
the supplemental which would cover spending in the fiscal year 
that ends sept 30 would provide 421 million in new spending and 
allow more than 100 million to be transferred among the budgets of 
various agencies 
supplemental spending for this year is supposed to be approved 
only for dire emergencies according to the budget summit 
agreement of last fall between president reagan and congressional 
leaders 
several senators said that to honor that pact they would 
withhold requests for additional spending this rare behavior 
inspired sen j bennett johnston dla a senior member of the 
committee to call the measure lean mean and urgent 
the largest slice of the legislation is 297 million for the 
veterans administration which needs more money because some of the 
benefits it pays are being adjusted for inflation and because the 
agencys caseload has been larger than expected 
the bill includes 60 million for the coast guard which says it 
needs the money to keep its ships and planes on patrol 554 
million for the justice department to cover expenses incurred 
during last years riots by mariel cuban detainees at federal 
prisons and 55 million for the agriculture department which has 
seen its spending go up as a result of the drought 
the measure would provide 226 million for fbi agents to 
observe soviet inspectors monitoring american compliance with the 
nuclear weapons treaty the two nations have signed 
the legislation also would transfer an estimated 49 million to 
trade programs for workers who lose their jobs because of imports 
and about 43 million to the program that dispenses benefits to 
victims of black lung disease 
on an 87 vote committee members voted to strip a provision 
that would have freed 44 million the government has withheld from 
the united nations the united states has been holding back 
portions of its annual contributions to the international agency 
arguing that the united nations needs to make management reforms 
the house approved a 1891 million version of the bill july 27 
it contains none of the veterans assistance house leaders have 
said they will try to pass a second bill containing less urgent 
spending

a 79yearold man convicted of 
murdering his ailing wife in what he called a mercy killing asked 
for a new trial tuesday saying his lawyer was compromised by 
emotions surrounding the case and negotiations for a movie deal 
roswell gilbert represented by a new attorney made a rare 
appearance in court during a hearing before broward circuit judge 
thomas coker 
reporters asked what gilbert wanted to accomplish during the 
twoday hearing 
something that will help me terminate this nightmare i 
guess he replied 
gilbert was convicted of firstdegree murder in the march 1985 
shooting death of emily gilbert his wife of 51 years at their 
seaside condominium the retired electronics engineer said he shot 
her twice in the head to end the misery she suffered from 
osteoporosis and alzheimers disease 
he was sentenced to life in prison 
the case was recounted in last years television movie mercy 
or murder which featured robert young as gilbert 
gilberts new attorney bradley stark said the original trial 
lawyer joseph varon had trouble separating the legal case from 
the movie a portion of which was filmed in varons office 
instead of being completely devoted to mr gilbert mr varon 
got swept away by the emotions of the event stark said 
stark said varon wanted to use gilberts trial to make the 
country aware of the lack of laws concerning euthanasia 
stark told the court gilberts contention that he shot his wife 
to put her out of her misery was not effectively made in the first 
trial 
one of the witnesses called was harry gulkin a partner in 
varons law firm who said gilbert was in a state of shock 
disbelief bewilderment and also very depressed about the whole 
thing contradicting the prosecutions argument that it was 
premeditated 
varon didnt think any juror in this county or this country 
for that matter would return a verdict of firstdegree murder 
gulkin said 
also testifying was steven gethers who produced the movie 
the movie would not have been made if gilbert had not been 
convicted of firstdegree murder the producer said 
for me the drama was in the sentence that was given he 
said 
stark presented evidence unheard at the first trial which he 
claims was rushed to make varons rights to gilberts story more 
profitable 
two neighbors mrs gilberts hairdresser aghdas sedghi and a 
waitress who served the couple regularly all testified that mrs 
gilberts health deteriorated rapidly shortly before the shooting 
she was suffering constantly from pains in her back said 
neighbor pauline mcginness she said if she became old or 
decrepit or put in a wheelchair she hoped someone would put her 
out 
assistant state attorney kelly hancock who prosecuted gilbert 
and expects to testify at the hearing rejects the argument varon 
mishandled the case 
hancock will argue that regardless of the defense gilbert 
killed his wife and understood the consequences 
gilbert is serving his sentence at lawtey correctional 
institution and has no chance of parole for 25 years 
gilbert signed a pretrial agreement with varon giving the lawyer 
the rights to his story mgmua productions paid varon 50000 for 
the rights 
gilbert donated his share 5000 in his wifes name to a 
nonprofit institution for alzheimers research

a tiny public restroom facility 
overtaken by drug addicts and street people sold for 504000 to a 
restaurateur who plans to build a threestory italian eatery on the 
site 
real estate auctioneer keith jones said the artdeco style 
restroom attracted 43 bids before gino bigazzi made the winning bid 
tuesday bigazzi who has another restaurant in sydney plans to 
tear down the restroom 
the price stunned the city council which had been willing to 
accept a bid about onethird of the selling price 
the property measuring 1300 square feet is in sydneys 
redlight suburb of kings cross 
the auctioneer promised bidders the property would be sold 
without the squatters who lived in the building 
the astronomical price reflects a real estate boom in sydney 
where many property prices have doubled during the past year

federal regulators hope tough new rules will 
help curtail the con artists who roll back odometers costing 
consumers more than 3 billion a year 
the regulations issued tuesday by the national highway traffic 
safety administration will impose stricter paperwork standards on 
states and auto dealers across the nation the rules take effect 
next april 
nhtsa estimated the requirements will cost 65 million 
annually although removal of other recordkeeping requirements 
will reduce the net cost 
douglas greenhaus an attorney for the national automobile 
dealers association said nhtsas rules would be good for the auto 
retailing industry 
it should result in a net benefit to dealers who are 
oftentimes victims of odometer fraud to the extent that they are 
purchasers of vehicles that have been spun back greenhaus said 
this rule will increase enforcement and help solve the odometer 
fraud problem it will benefit dealers in the long run 
nhtsas regulations required by the truth in mileage act passed 
by congress in 1986 will require all motorvehicle titles issued 
after april 29 1989 be printed so that counterfeiting and 
alteration can be detected easily titles also must include mileage 
readings and a place for buyers to disclose the mileage when a car 
is sold 
the intent of the law has always been to protect consumers by 
providing an official paper trail of odometer readings that may be 
checked by car owners and law enforcement officials to determine 
whether the odometer has been turned back said diane steed 
nhtsa administrator this rule will make that law easier 
the regulations also would require that 
sellers disclose odometer readings when transferring title 
either on the title or on a separate form 
dealers distributors leasing companies and automotive 
auctions maintain records of cars sold for at least five years 
after the transaction 
people leasing cars tell the leasing company the vehicles 
mileage at the end of the leasing period 
steed said nhtsa was adopting a flexible position on 
implementing this rule allowing states to request an extension 
of the compliance deadline beyond april 
the rules would cost the states 39 million a year nhtsa said 
the estimated cost to auto dealers and leasing companies would be 
26 million but it would be offset by a provision eliminating 
most separate odometer statements nhtsa said

a court decision ordering the reagan 
administration to relax eligibility standards for elderly people to 
get health care at home could help thousands of medicare 
recipients according to a lawyer in the case 
us district judge stanley sporkins decision overturning a 
medicare regulation may encourage thousands of recipients to apply 
for benefits they thought they never had said william dombi legal 
director of the national association for home care which brought 
the lawsuit 
sporkin overturned a 1986 regulation defining parttime or 
intermittent care as limiting eligibility to patients who 
received four or fewer home visits a week 
sporkin said the fourday limit produces absurd results 
a beneficiary needing a total of five hours of care per week 
is denied coverage if the care is needed over the course of five or 
more days while the person needing as many as 27 hours of care 
spread over only four days may qualify for coverage the judge 
said in a 69page opinion released tuesday 
home health care beneficiaries must survive seven days a week 
their medical needs do not take weekends off he said 
dombi said the decision probably affects several thousand 
medicare beneficiaries who were denied reimbursement for visits by 
nurses or health aides 
people who sought nursinghome care as the alternative may now 
have a chance to come into the home setting he said 
it also will encourage people who are receiving less care than 
they need to get medicare reimbursement for more frequent visits 
we presented evidence that indicated people were receiving less 
care than they needed solely to qualify for some benefit payment 
dombi said 
people who have deprived themselves of care may come back into 
the system dombi said 
sporkin ordered the department of health and human services to 
reopen claims that had been denied since the lawsuit was filed feb 
17 1987 by the home care organization on behalf of 17 medicare 
recipients the lawsuit was joined by 14 members of congress 
sporkin found that hhs had improperly interpreted the term 
parttime or intermittent to mean that care must be both 
parttime and intermittent the plaintiffs argued that when 
congress enacted the medicare program in 1965 it intended that 
such home visits could be one or the other 
the definition amounted to a fourday limit on visits that a 
medicare patient could receive each week from care providers the 
judge found 
robert hardy a spokesman for the health care financing 
administration an hhs unit that operates medicare said we 
havent read the opinion but we believe that hcfa is properly 
administering the home health benefit 
dombi predicted the government would appeal sporkins decision 
but hardy declined to comment on what legal steps the agency would 
take 
legislation recently signed by president reagan providing 
catastrophic care coverage for medicare recipients contains 
language that lifts the fourday restriction 
sporkin also determined that the agencys policy forced elderly 
people to go to administrative law judges to get the benefits to 
which they are legally entitled most of the administrative law 
judges side with the patients when they rule on the claims sporkin 
said 
but those that have insufficient energy or resources to appeal 
simply fall by the wayside sporkin said 
the judge said there were no statistics to indicate how many of 
the 100000 people denied homecare benefits last year were refused 
payment because of the fourday limit 
but the judge estimated the number of such people certainly is 
in the hundreds and may be in the thousands 
home care was offered by congress sporkin said as a more 
economical and humane alternative to hospitals or nursing homes 
harold galbraith a paraplegic who suffers severe skin ulcers 
and needs a catheter was refused reimbursement for five hourly 
visits each week by a health aide the judge noted 
with the help of the aide mr galbraith has managed to use a 
wheelchair and has achieved some independence at his home and has 
avoided going to an institution sporkin said 
sporkin has yet to rule on the plaintiffs challenge to the 
agencys definition of reasonable and necessary care

house sponsors say theyll likely accept 
senate provisions of a fair housing bill and send the most 
farreaching civil rights measure in two decades to president 
reagan 
the senate voted 943 tuesday to expand protection of the 
nations fair housing law to the disabled and families with 
children and empower the government to seek stiff fines for 
property owners found guilty of bias 
final congressional action is no longer in doubt since the 
house passed a similar bill 37623 last june the only remaining 
question is whether the house will take the quickest route to final 
passage by accepting senate changes or try for compromise 
language 
president reagan has endorsed the senate bill 
chief house sponsor don edwards dcalif when asked if the 
senate bill was acceptable said i think so but i havent seen 
it yet from what we hear of it the answer is yes we expect to 
accept the bill without going to conference 
republican cosponsor rep hamilton fish of new york said 
through a spokesman that he probably would go along with the senate 
version but needs to look it over first 
the nations current housing law was passed in 1968 in the wake 
of martin luther king jrs assassination but the federal 
government was given no real enforcement powers 
the proposed legislation would enable the secretary of housing 
and urban development to go to court to fight for victims of 
housing bias 
but just as significant are the expanded protections in the bill 
beyond the current bar to racial and sexual discrimination 
by adding protection for families with children under 18 the 
legislation would prevent adults only restrictions exemptions 
are included for communities for the elderly 
the measure would not only bar discrimination against the 
disabled or handicapped but also require that new multiunit 
residences be constructed so they would be accessible to such 
people this provision would take effect 30 months after enactment 
and apply to housing with four or more units 
three of the senates most conservative republicans voted 
against the senate bill tuesday jesse helms of north carolina 
steve symms of idaho and gordon humphrey of new hampshire 
sens joseph biden ddel dale bumpers dark and harry 
reid dnev did not vote 
the senate language was the product of behindthescenes 
negotiations that eventually yielded agreement among civil rights 
groups real estate agents homebuilders organized labor and the 
reagan administration 
staff members of vice president george bush the certain gop 
presidential nominee were instrumental in working out the senate 
language democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has 
endorsed the bill 
housing and urban development secretary samuel pierce who 
helped put the measure together called it a meaningful expansion 
of our nations fair housing laws 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights called the bipartisan bill the most dramatic and 
significant improvement in civil rights law since 1965 
the bill would permit the department of housing and urban 
development to go to court after voluntary efforts failed to 
resolve discrimination complaints cases could be prosecuted before 
huds administrative law judges or in federal court at the request 
of any party 
the administrative judge could award actual damages issue 
injunctions prohibiting further discrimination grant attorneys 
fees and award civil penalties the maximum fines would be 10000 
for a first violation 25000 for a second violation within a 
fiveyear period and 50000 for two or more violations within a 
sevenyear period 
the administrative judges ruling would be subject to review by 
a federal appellate court 
if the federal court route was chosen the judge could add 
punitive damages to the penalties 
the bill would continue the current right of victims to file 
private civil suits but would extend the filing deadline from the 
current 180 days to two years after the discriminatory incident a 
1000 limit on punitive damages in the private suits would be 
eliminated 
disabled tenants would have the right to make reasonable 
modifications to the premises at their own expense the tenants 
would have to agree to return the dwelling to its original 
condition when they leave

the steel industry turned a profit last year 
but its problems will surface again if the next president does not 
renew import quotas that expire in 1989 steel company executives 
said 
a handful of executives told the congressional steel caucus on 
tuesday that they were encouraged by public and private statements 
by the two presidential contenders that the next administration 
will extend the quotas which cover 30 nations 
the steel industry was profitable last year for the first time 
since 1981 
but allowing the socalled voluntary restraint agreements 
with japan south korea and other nations to lapse in 1989 could 
have dire consequences said thomas c graham president of the 
steel division of usx corp the nations largest steel producer 
our balance sheets are still very fragile and most analysts 
see a market downturn in the relatively near future graham said 
he said the worldwide excess capacity and foreign governments 
steelmaking subsidies and unfair trading practices that prompted 
the establishment of the quotas have not disappeared 
graham and david hoag president and chief executive officer of 
ltv steel co the no 2 steelmaker said the presidential campaign 
had yielded encouraging signals about steel trade from democratic 
contender michael dukakis and republican rival george bush 
the domestic steel industry is very grateful that 
massachusetts gov dukakis has stated his support for continuing 
the voluntary restraint agreements and were hopeful that vice 
president bush will also come out for extension before too long 
graham said 
in an interview hoag said that bush has said he is favorably 
inclined to extending the agreements but he hasnt said it 
publicly calls to the bush campaign were referred to vice 
presidential press assistant kristin taylor who said she would 
have to consult other aides before providing an answer 
hoag said the push to continue the trade agreements was an 
industry position also briefing caucus members tuesday were 
walter f williams chairman of bethlehem steel corp the 
thirdleading steelmaker and joseph toot jr president of the 
timken co 
hoag said last years industrywide net income of 1 billion was 
good news but he added that there has been little change in 
the global structural conditions that contributed to the worst 
period ever in the industrys history 12 billion in losses 
during 19821986 
congressional pressure and a finding by the us international 
trade commission that the steel industry was being harmed by 
imports led the reagan administration to negotiate fiveyear 
agreements with leading steelexporting nations in 1984 the 
agreements placed productbyproduct caps on the amount of steel 
that can be imported into the united states each year 
the american institute for imported steel an association of 70 
steel importers has lobbied against the quotas saying free 
enterprise must prevail 
us firms that rely on imported steel claim that the reagan 
program has stifled competition raised prices and caused harmful 
shortages of certain types of steel 
since the quotas took effect in 1984 the foreign share of the 
american steel market has dropped from nearly 30 percent to roughly 
21 percent steel firms say the reduction has given them enough 
breathing space and market stability to enable them to modernize

house agriculture committee chairman e 
kika de la garza says he thinks president reagan probably would 
accept a temporary 50cent increase in the pricesupport level for 
milk if it arrived on his desk as part of drought relief 
legislation 
i feel confident that this wont violate the guidelines that 
we received from the white house de la garza dtexas said 
tuesday as house and senate negotiators prepared to meet to resolve 
differences over the drought bill 
the house last week approved as part of its drought bill a 
compromise that would raise the pricesupport level for milk by 50 
cents but only from april through june next year after which the 
benefit would expire 
the compromise offered by reps steve gunderson rwis and tim 
penny dminn replaced a proposed permanent increase of 50 cents 
in the pricesupport level starting in october agriculture 
secretary richard lyng lobbied against such a measure saying it 
would cost 300 million 
lawmakers said the price tag would be less than half that they 
placed the cost of the gundersonpenny version at 100 million 
both the house and senate versions of the bill would cancel a 
50cent cut in the support level but the senate has no provision 
for an increase and that represents one of the major differences 
the conference committee must resolve 
at the heart of both bills are disaster payments to farmers 
equal to 65 percent of earnings lost as a result of crop losses in 
excess of 35 percent of the expected harvest 
de la garza was noncommittal about a key senate provision not 
contained in the house version of the drought bill it would allow 
ethanol makers to buy corn and other governmentowned commodities 
for 110 percent of the acquisition prices well below current cash 
crop prices that have skyrocketed as a result of the drought 
ethanol makers could buy up to 2 million bushels a month but a 
total of no more than 16 million bushels a month would be available 
and the program would end in september 1989 
the measure is being presented as a frank effort to help small 
hardpressed ethanol makers with a price break but it also could 
mean a substantial break for the archer daniels midland co of 
decatur ill a major company that manufactures the lions share 
of domestic ethanol 
i could live with it as long as they spread around some of the 
joy and didnt just save everything for the big boys if they let 
some of the little guys have some too de la garza said 
ethanol is ethyl alcohol made from farm goods such as corn and 
mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol 
ethanol also has been causing a snag in efforts to win fast 
senate approval of legislation to curb record us trade deficits 
farmstate senators have been trying to knock out a housepassed 
provision that would increase dutyfree imports of caribbean 
ethanol 
us corn growers are anxious to hold down imports and say the 
caribbean products often are nothing more than european 
agricultural products such as spanish wine that have been run 
through island ethanol refineries 
meanwhile de la garza and a contingent of farm democrats are 
scheduled to fly to boston on wednesday night for a talk with 
presidential nominee michael dukakis at his brookline mass home 
i dont think he wants to talk about the drought so much as 
the future of farming de la garza said

advised in an interview in the departmentproduced magazine foreign 
agriculture 
visit and study the market she said keep in touch with 
customers try to understand their needs and be flexible in meeting 
those needs above all be flexible japan is a big market 
the japanese imported 20 billion worth of agricultural 
commodities in 1987 67 billion of that amount or about 20 
percent from the united states chief competitors are australia 
canada and argentina for grains france and germany for wines the 
entire european community for processed foods thailand for chicken 
and denmark and taiwan for pork 
hale said young japanese are becoming much more 
adventuresome in eating habits with italian and mexican 
restaurants burgeoning in tokyo 
there are a lot of opportunities in the market for traditional 
westernstyle foods as well she said 
she said healthconsciousness is sharpening among japanese food 
buyers and because more women are working than ever before there 
is greater interest in convenience foods that can be readily 
prepared 
she cited japanese import quotas and food additive regulations 
as among some of the toughest problems that us exporters face 
another difficulty for us companies is that japanese 
consumers are used to highquality packaging she said a few 
us companies have developed special packaging for japan but much 
more could be done

sen howard metzenbaum is moving to block 
handgun shopping sprees by violent drug dealers by attaching his 
waitingperiod proposal to a sweeping drug bill 
however the move announced tuesday by the ohio democrat 
triggered a skirmish at a congressional hearing with the national 
rifle association which says the proposal wont work 
metzenbaum who chaired the hearing of the senate judiciary 
constitution subcommittee said drug traffickers are illegally 
purchasing sophisticated highpowered guns from legitimate dealers 
because there is no federal law to allow police to check whether a 
purchaser is a convicted felon or illegal alien 
i do not advocate nor do i support legislation to confiscate 
or ban handguns from lawabiding citizens said metzenbaum but 
it is absurd for the federal government to stand idly by while 
violent and dangerous drug pushers arm themselves in federally 
licensed and regulated gun stores 
metzenbaums bill would require a sevenday waiting period prior 
to the purchase of a handgun to allow police time to conduct 
background checks on wouldbe buyers the senator said he would try 
to attach it to the drug bill as an amendment when it comes before 
the full senate 
but james jay baker chief lobbyist for the nra said his group 
opposed the bill 
we dont think its going to work said baker the people 
you are trying to impact are the same ones that are going to have 
false ids the same ones who get their guns on the black market 
not through gun stores 
metzenbaum told baker that if the facts were presented honestly 
to members of the nra he thinks most of them would support the 
waiting period 
unfortunately you and the washington lobbyists of the nra 
have not presented the case honestly to your members he said 
i disagree with that obviously baker replied 
metzenbaum accused baker of mailing nra members a fourpage 
letter full of gross distortions and false statements the 
senator said he has never called for banning the right of any 
lawabiding individual to own guns 
baker said the first version of a metzenbaum bill directed at 
plastic handguns would have banned a number of firearms 
metzenbaum also said the nra literature contends that the 
waitingperiod bill would set up a national handgun registration 
system and that the congressional budget office estimates it would 
cost law enforcement agencies 30 million to 40 million a year to 
implement 
the senator said the bill requires that all forms generated be 
destroyed within 60 days and that the cbo estimates are for another 
bill requiring different federal background checks 
baker said there is nothing in the legislation that would 
prevent police from taking the information in the forms and putting 
it into some centralized recordkeeping file however he 
acknowledged that the cost estimate applied to a different 14day 
waiting period proposal 
it was the best one we had he said it was an estimate 
baker charged metzenbaum with running campaign ads which said 
the senator took on the gun lobby and passed a bill to outlaw 
copkiller bullets baker said the nra in fact supported the final 
bill on copkiller bullets 
i dont think that the national rifle association is the only 
one that uses some hyperbole in their fundraising documents 
said baker 
phillip mcguire associate director of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms told the subcommittee that a national 
sevenday waiting period would make it more difficult for drug 
dealers to buy handguns from licensed dealers 
mcguire said a drug dealer with dozens of convictions can 
currently buy an uzi at a gun store by falsifying forms the uzi is 
defined as a semiautomatic handgun that can fire 100 rounds a 
minute he said

a group of astronomers making routine 
measurements on a star have found the first confirmed evidence of a 
planet orbiting a star other than our own sun 
david w latham who led the team that made the discovery said 
the planet is 30000 times larger than the earth and probably 
lifeless because it would have a surface temperature of hundreds of 
degrees 
its much hotter than an oven said latham this is not a 
place you would look for life 
the planet is so close to its star that it orbits once every 84 
days latham said mercury the planet closest to the sun has an 
orbit of 87 days 
latham reports on the discovery today at the 20th general 
assembly of the international astronomical union in baltimore 
latham and his team found the planet while running instrument 
tests on a star called hd 114762 he said the star was one of a 
group called candidate standard stars that astronomers have 
been measuring for years to establish the characteristics of basic 
star types the study is being conducted to give astronomers 
worldwide a standard for calibrating instruments 
using light gathered by a 61inch reflector telescope at the oak 
ridge observatory in massachusetts the astronomers processed the 
star sightings through an instrument called the photon counting 
system 
the instrument detected a slight wobble in the motion of the 
star that could only be caused by a nearby orbiting body 
latham said the planet would have to be massive some 20 times 
larger than jupiter the largest planet in the solar system in 
order to give star hd 114762 such a wobble 
its at the upper edge of being the size of a planet 
latham said minimum starlike bodies are usually 100 times the size 
of jupiter 
despite its size the planet is too small and too distant to be 
seen directly star hd 114762 is 90 light years from earth about 
522 trillion miles away seeing the planet would be like trying to 
sight a single candle placed beside a powerful searchlight on the 
moon latham said 
instead the scientists used calculations of the gravitational 
effects on the star to determine that another body was there 
latham said the discovery raises the intriguing possibility that 
companion bodies or planetlike bodies orbiting stars may be 
more common than previously believed 
it wouldnt surprise me if more people started finding them 
he said 
latham added it would be pretty boring if there werent lots 
of planets because that would mean there arent many chances for 
life 
the technique that discovered the planet around star hd 114762 
is not sensitive enough he said to find a planet the size of 
earth 
were far short of being able to find anything as small as 
earth he said because the gravitational effect on a star would 
be too slight to be detected 
star hd 114762 is a magnitude 7 too faint to be seen by the 
naked eye it is also a spring star seen only from march through 
july the tilt of the earth causes it to be blotted from view by 
the sun from august through february 
detection of the planet around the star has been confirmed by a 
swiss astronomer michel mayor at the geneva observatory 
members of lathams team include robert stefanik richard 
mccrosky and robert davis of the smithsonian and tsevi mazeh of 
the university of tel aviv

senate leaders are pushing for fast action on 
their bill to curb trade deficits but they face obstacles posed by 
farm belt lawmakers who want to reduce caribbean ethanol imports 
we are going to send the president another trade bill 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said tuesday as 
lawmakers turned to the 1000page measure that has lingered on 
their calendar in one form or another for the last three years 
they planned to discourage any amendments whisk the 
housepassed measure through the senate and speed it toward 
president reagans desk this week 
amendments would send the measure to a housesenate conference 
committee that easily could become bogged down senate leaders said 
that might prove fatal with only 26 legislative days remaining 
before they recess and head for the campaign trail full time 
however an array of amendments quickly materialized including 
changes proposed by sen j james exon dneb and other farm 
state lawmakers opposed to a provision of the bill that would 
increase the amount of dutyfree ethanol imported from the 
caribbean 
ethanol is ethyl alcohol made from agricultural products and 
blended with gasoline to form the fuel gasahol us corn growers 
are sharply opposed to any increase in imports and complain that 
the caribbean product often consists of european goods such as 
spanish wine recycled in island refineries 
the lawmakers are seeking to delete the ethanol provision or at 
least alter it to bar any upsurge in shipments 
the trade bill dormant for weeks came to the senate floor only 
hours after president reagan announced that he would allow to 
become law a separate measure requiring companies to provide their 
employees with advance notice of plant closings and largescale 
layoffs 
reagan had vetoed an earlier version of the trade bill which 
contained the plantclosings provision saying that provision would 
needlessly tie the hands of business 
there had been an implied threat than unless the president 
signed the plantclosings measure the trade bill could die in the 
senate 
the administration has not been very enthusiastic about trade 
bills either but it is getting anxious to receive congressional 
authorization to conclude agreements under the current uruguay 
round of international trade talks the bill would provide that 
authorization along with accelerated consideration by the house and 
senate of deals made in the negotiations 
the president indicated that he wanted a trade bill thats 
why he swallowed the plant closings said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan 
besides giving the administration authority to reach trade 
agreements the measure would streamline the machinery under which 
the government imposes import restraints they are used to protect 
us industries and retaliate against violations of international 
rules and other unfair practices 
other provisions range from a potential 2 billion in 
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil 
company earnings 
the measure is largely shorn of the protectionism that once 
brought fierce opposition from both the administration and a raft 
of congressional critics 
even though the measure is likely to pass by a wide margin one 
of the senates most outspoken free traders sen daniel j evans 
rwash was critical of it in floor debate tuesday night 
the real problem isnt corrected by this bill he said 
the real problem is that we as a nation are spending too much 
living beyond our means and saving too little evans said 
evans whose homestate economy includes an exportdependent 
aircraft industry and a major port said that because the economy 
is now performing well the measure is probably too late if it was 
ever necessary and in this senators view it was probably never 
necessary at all 
this trade bill represents those who fear the future not 
those who have confidence in the future he said

the federal government will throw new muscle 
into the fight against the areas deadly street gangs but the 
police chief of the nations secondlargest city complained the 
added effort is just crumbs from washington 
a 34member task force will attack the web of gang crime that 
has afflicted los angeles and spread to other cities across the 
west and midwest us attorney robert c bonner said tuesday 
police chief daryl gates noting that federal and local agencies 
routinely work together welcomed the effort but also complained 
what is new is that were getting just a few crumbs from 
washington gates said 
referring to increasingly mobile drugdealing gang members 
gates said we had to send the little rotten sobs to 446 cities 
throughout the united states and terrorize some of the other cities 
before washington recognized we had a problem 
the task force will prosecute gang members under federal 
statutes that are more stringent than state laws 
task force members include reassigned employees from the drug 
enforcement administration and bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms the us attorneys office 10 police departments the 
los angeles county sheriffs department and state county and city 
prosecutors 
smashing los angeles street gang drugtrafficking organizations 
at their source requires federal support and federal prosecution 
and recognition that this is a national problem bonner said 
noting that gang involvement has been reported in rock cocaine 
distribution in dozens of us cities 
previous federal efforts had snared some gangrelated drug 
traffickers but their primary focus was on highlevel 
international distributors of illegal narcotics he said 
bonner said federal prosecutions would employ organized crime 
statutes against gangs and to get stiff penalties such as 
mandatory fiveyear prison sentences for possession of as little as 
5 grams of cocaine 
pretrial detention and forfeiture of property also will be used 
we will be using the bottomless pit of the federal system 
bonner said 
at tuesdays news conference representatives of sen alan 
cranston dcalif presented a statement urging support for 
legislation introduced by cranston and california congressmen mel 
levine and howard berman that would add 600 agents to federal 
agencies in los angeles 
the lawmakers said the los angeles situation required greater 
effort than the use of 300 federal agents assigned in 1982 to stem 
the flow of drugs in florida 
city attorney james hahn said los angeles was unquestionably 
the gang capital drug capital of the united states and he noted 
that in the first six months of 1988 there were 112 gangrelated 
murders within city limit compared with 99 during the period last 
year 
in the county at least 166 people have died this year in 
gangrelated violence and 387 were killed last year among the 
latest victims of gang violence was a 19yearold man shot to death 
this week on a south los angeles street 
hahn said state laws arent tough enough and he lauded the state 
assemblys public safety committee for its approval monday of a 
bill intended to help authorities crack down on street gangs 
the bill would increase prison penalties for gangrelated crimes 
and make it a crime to be involved with a street gang while knowing 
the gang intends to be involved in criminal activity 
the bill also would make parents responsible for supervising 
minor children to help prevent gang activity

coretta scott king says congress must provide 
the means and encouragement for the federal commission that 
coordinates observances of the holiday honoring her late husband 
the rev martin luther king jr 
the congress placed an enormous responsibility upon the 
commission but it gave no funds mrs king who chairs the 
martin luther king jr federal holiday commission told a house 
panel tuesday 
i ask the congress which gave birth to the national holiday to 
help us continue our work to give us the means and encouragement 
to complete the job we have just started 
the king commission was created on a temporary basis in 1984 as 
part of a bill to make the civil rights leaders birthday a 
national holiday because of opposition to the bill from some 
conservative members of congress led by sen jesse helms rnc 
funding plans for the commission were dropped in order to get the 
bill passed 
the commissions congressional mandate expires in april 1989 
and a bill sponsored by rep john conyers dmich now before the 
census and population subcommittee of the house post office and 
civil service committee would provide 300000 in annual funding 
sen lowell weicker rconn a supporter of the conyers bill 
said requests to the commission now outstrip what the group is able 
to accomplish 
the commission has more work than the meager resources it has 
been able to raise from the private sector can begin to support 
weicker said 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif who chairs the house panel 
agreed and pledged to add an amendment to the legislation that 
would increase funding to at least 500000 per year 
the commission processed more than 5000 information requests 
and helped 135 state and local governments plan holiday events in 
1987 according to commission records 
the atlantabased commission collected 183552 in private 
contributions in 1987 and has no paid employees the records 
showed 
nearly all money received went to producing newsletters and 
pamphlets on kings life said lloyd davis the commissions 
executive director staff assistance comes from federal employees 
loaned out from their agencies on a temporary basis he said 
by contrast the commission on the bicentennial of the united 
states constitution will receive 21 million in federal money this 
year while the united states holocaust memorial council will 
receive just over 2 million 
were talking about a desperate situation davis said we 
simply cant do it without some federal help 
dymally said the bill should reach the full post office and 
civil service committee next week and be considered on the house 
floor in september 
the holiday is officially celebrated on the third monday in 
january which falls close to kings jan 15 birthday the only 
states that do not observe the date are arizona new hampshire 
montana wyoming south dakota and idaho 
besides king only george washington and abraham lincoln have 
their birthdays marked by national holidays 
meanwhile mrs king revealed some of the plans for a second 
march on washington to be held in commemoration of the historic 
i have a dream speech her husband delivered 25 years ago before 
more than 200000 civil rights activists in front of the lincoln 
memorial 
the celebration scheduled for aug 27 will focus on 
employment housing and civil rights issues she said

representatives for producers and striking 
scriptwriters met tuesday exploring ways to break a deadlock in 
the 22weekold labor dispute that has shut down most hollywood 
production 
the informal talks were continuing as of 11 pm tuesday 
although the top west coast official of the writers guild of 
america expressed hope that agreement could be reached the union 
and producers declined to elaborate tuesday on the exact nature of 
the discussions 
there is nothing i can comment on now spokeswoman cheryl 
rhoden said we are using every avenue we can to have the talks 
resume 
after the formal federally mediated talks collapsed early 
saturday morning intermediaries for the opposing sides made 
contact to determine if negotiations should resume ms rhoden said 
the contacts spurred hope among some at wga headquarters that a 
settlement with the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers might be near two guild sources said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
herb steinberg a spokesman for the producers alliance 
confirmed that intermediaries were attempting to resume talks 
the alliance is not a part of it steinberg said its 
shuttle diplomacy 
the main sticking point in the contract dispute is how much 
writers should be paid for syndicated reruns of television shows 
the 9000member guild blamed the collapse of formal negotiations 
on the alliance while producers said the guild made unreasonable 
demands and refused to compromise 
brian walton executive director of the guild on the west coast 
said late monday that he had spoken with two representatives of the 
dissident writers coalition which has threatened to break away 
from the guild to return to work 
the coalition of 21 writers has pushed for a strike settlement 
under contract terms that the guild has strongly opposed 
walton said he did not guarantee them that an end to the strike 
was imminent but asked them to remain patient all i said was 
that i was hopeful walton said 
the group has threatened to drop out of the strike and was 
expected to resign from the guild this week after a fourhour 
strategy conference monday the coalition announced it would 
continue to honor the walkout that began march 7 
but the dissidents will again reconsider resigning if the strike 
continues past weeks end said lionel chetwynd a spokesman for 
the coalition 
an official at 20th century fox film studio said monday that his 
company will pay any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters 
who cross picket lines 
barry diller the head of 20th century fox made the offer 
according to fox spokesman michael binkow 
guild fines against strikebreaking writers are set at 110 
percent of all compensation received for unauthorized strike work 
and violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild ms 
rhoden said

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
backed down and said he would not try to impose a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war after iraq declared it would reject such a truce 
iraq continued tuesday to insist on direct talks with iran 
before a ceasefire but in iran president ali khamenei said his 
government would not agree to facetoface negotiations before a 
truce and that an end to the 8yearold war appears extremely 
doubtful 
riyadh alqaysi iraqs former un ambassador and now a member 
of the iraqi delegation to unmediated peace talks accused iran 
of seeking simply a ceasefire which they so urgently need after 
their successive defeats 
he said iraq would reject any ceasefire it had not agreed to 
and would not allow iran to regroup during a truce we will not 
accept a fait accompli no matter in what form or from which 
quarter it comes 
iraq has continued attacks on iran despite tehrans announcement 
july 18 that it was finally accepting a yearold un security 
council ceasefire resolution 
iraq said last year that it would accept resolution 598 which 
calls for a ceasefire withdrawal to recognized borders prisoner 
exchange peace negotiations and an investigation of which side 
started the war 
on monday perez de cuellar said listen dday the day a 
ceasefire begins does not depend on the parties 
asked if he might announce dday if iraq remains opposed the 
un chief said that is a decision which i have to take in any 
case in consultation with the members of the security council 
but on tuesday he said when i say i will declare a 
ceasefire with members of the security council i do not exclude 
that i would be in touch with the two foreign ministers 
un officials said the secretarygeneral would be consulting 
now with the head of a un factfinding team gen martin vadset 
of norway who arrives thursday from the persian gulf then with 
the security council and foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of 
iran and tariq aziz of iraq 
on tuesday perez de cuellar did not meet official with either 
foreign minister the talks began last week 
khameini said we shall not accept any preconditions from iraq 
over the implementation of the resolution and a ceasefire on the 
fronts such as direct negotiations or any other condition 
if iraq sets down preconditions we too shall set down a 
condition and ours will be what we have stated before the 
punishment of the aggressor he said in a speech on tehran radio 
monitored in cyprus 
during the year of irans holdout on the resolution it insisted 
there could be no truce until iraq was branded as the aggressor 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several border skirmishes 
in a speech at a rally in ahvaz near the iraqi border khamenei 
criticized the iraqi regimes attitude during the past two weeks 
its obstructionist behavior regarding the implementation of 
resolution 598 
i look at the prospect of achieving peace and an end to the 
war in the context of resolution 598 as extremely doubtful and 
suspect he said this enemy has proved that it understands 
nothing except the language of force and of strength 
qaysi said resolution 598 is not simply a ceasefire it is a 
peace plan and that has to be negotiated facetoface to test the 
real intentions of iran 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said the 
secretarygeneral should declare a dday to begin a ceasefire even 
if iraq is opposed and that the security council should consider 
imposing an arms embargo against iraq if it does not accept a truce

three men who have refused to testify 
before a grand jury investigating an alleged plot to use libyan 
government money to recruit support in the united states can remain 
free until thursday afternoon to appeal a contempt order a federal 
judge ruled 
us district judge ts ellis iii on tuesday gave vernon 
bellecourt william means and bob brown until 5 pm thursday to 
appeal to the 4th us circuit court of appeals the order that they 
be jailed for civil contempt of court 
the three have been told they are not targets of the 
investigation they were promised immunity from prosecution but 
refused to testify in protest over the governments wire tapping of 
their phones and what they said were other violations of their 
rights 
six libyans and two other arab nationals were accused last week 
in a 40count indictment that charges them with laundering money 
and violating the 1986 libyan sanctions regulations that prohibit 
travel to and transactions with libya 
the indictment makes no mention of previous accusations that one 
of the eight participated in a plot to assassinate a senior us 
official purportedly former white house aide oliver north who 
helped plan the 1986 us bombing of libya 
attorney john keats representing bellecourt and means argued 
that their testimony was not needed since the grand jury already 
had returned indictments 
but assistant us attorney lawrence j leiser said that there 
are continuing ongoing investigations being conducted by the grand 
jury 
are you referring to indictments other than those already 
handed down asked ellis 
absolutely leiser replied he did not elaborate 
bellecourt of the white earth chippewa nation from northern 
minnesota said he visited libya several times and was an organizer 
of a 1987 rally in tripoli marking the first anniversary of the 
us bombing 
means of the international indian treaty council also has 
acknowledged visiting libya 
brown is from the allafrican peoples revolutionary party 
which supports a unified africa before the hearing he told a news 
conference we proudly traveled to libya to condemn this 
governments barbaric attack and reaffirm our first amendment

investigators probing alleged pentagon 
procurement fraud are investigating whether rep bill chappell and 
others receive money illegally funneled from the unisys corp the 
washington post reported today 
the money allegedly came to chappell a florida democrat and 
others influential in defense contracting through operating 
expenses and purchasing orders of armtec inc a small 
subcontractor based in palatka fla the newspaper said citing 
unidentified sources federal agents seized records from the 
florida plant in a june 14 raid 
chappell could not be reached for comment tuesday night but he 
told the newspaper he is not a target of the investigation and that 
he has conducted himself in an ethical manner 
i think it is inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of 
this ongoing investigation and i hope the investigation will go 
forward in the most fair expeditious manner chappell told the 
post 
under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning 
contracts worth billions of dollars 
documents unsealed in a new york court last month showed that 
investigators were examining whether private consultants and others 
extorted campaign contributions from companies 
the papers also indicated investigators were looking into 
whether defense industry officials consultants and others bribed 
federal officials involved in authorizing or appropriating defense 
contracts 
chappell and other congressmen have been mentioned earlier as 
subjects of investigative interest in the probe 
however henry hudson the us attorney for northern virgnia 
who is in charge of the investigation has told congressional 
leaders that no members of congress were targets of the probe 
according to congressional sources who attended meetings with 
hudson 
the newspaper said the investigation involving chappell concerns 
william w roberts a retired unisys executive william m galvin 
a defense procurement consultant and charles f gardner a former 
vice president of unisys plant in great neck ny 
roberts and galvin formed armtec in 1986 to produce wire 
harnesses for a shipboard electronic warfare system manufactured at 
the great neck plant and gardner arranged for the noncompetitive 
contract with armtec the newspaper said 
investigators have subpoenaed the financial records of an ocala 
fla health club in which chappell once had an interest

27 including an american clergyman according to government and 
witness reports 
a witness to the attack on the rama river said about a dozen 
americans and several sandinista soldiers were aboard the vessel a 
regular passenger boat on the river called the peace mission 
witnesses said about 200 people were aboard the vessel 
the boat was traveling upstream to the town of rama after 
leaving bluefields the countrys main caribbean port when a group 
of contras began firing weapons at about 4 pm the defense 
ministry said 
it said two people were killed and 27 wounded and that all the 
victims were civilians 
one of the american passengers gail walker 29 said her 
father the rev lucius walker was grazed in the buttocks by a 
bullet but he was fine now and receiving some stitches 
speaking in a telephone interview in managua where the group 
was flown after the attack ms walker said the attack lasted about 
10 minutes 
walker 59 of demarest nj is executive director of the 
interreligious foundation for communication organizations an 
interdenominational group based in new york ms walker 29 of 
paterson nj is its communications programming director 
the communique said the raid occurred near the village of el 
mango about 150 miles southeast of managua 
the rama river connects the recently built managuarama road and 
links the capital with bluefields where nicaragua receives the 
bulk of its military supplies from the soviet union cuba and other 
soviet bloc nations 
the only other port capable of handling military supplies is 
puerto sandino on the west coast which would require a long trip 
through the panama canal 
ms walker said the contras opened fire on the boat two hours 
before it was to reach rama 
i dove down the stairs i figured brusies were better than 
bullet holes the bullets came through the walls she said 
adding that she was a little bruised a little hoarse a little 
scared but ok 
about 20 sandinista soldiers were on the top deck when the 
attack came but most of the contra fire was aimed at the 
midsection of the vessel where the civilians were standing ms 
walker said 
she said she and her father came with the religious group which 
does not support president reagans central american policy to 
nicaragua on july 26 to find out first hand the actual situation 
of the country 
now were all in agreement on condemning contra aid this was 
a civilian boat she added 
no confirmation or claim of responsibility had surfaced by late 
tuesday from the ussupported rebels known as contras 
the contras have tried to cut the managuabluefields supply link 
several times in january they seized several towns and villages 
along the managuarama road to stop the supply flow but later 
retreated 
the attack violates a fragile ceasefire to which the contras 
and the leftist sandinista government agreed on march 23 
later efforts by the two sides have failed to negotiate a 
permanent truce in the 7yearold war and reagan is seeking to 
renew military aid to the contras which congress cut off in 
february 
the ceasefire was due to end june 30 but was tacitly extended 
by both sides despite complaints of violations the truce was due 
to expire again on july 31 but president daniel ortega 
unilaterally extended it to aug 31 
the last sandinistacontra meeting was on june 9 the saninistas 
offered to meet again in managua on aug 2629 but the contras 
said they want the meeting held outside the country

a small filipino cargo vessel exploded 
and sank in the gulf of oman early today persian gulfbased 
shipping executives reported 
the cause of the explosion could not be immediately determined 
and it was not known if there were any casualties 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
explosion could have resulted from engine problems but they did 
not exclude the possibility that the vessel hit a mine 
the executives identified the vessel as the 1870ton fatima 
they said a french warship in the vicinity rushed to help and 
rescued seven crew members about 30 miles off oman outside the 
strait of hormuz gateway to the persian gulf 
mines were detected south of where the vessel sank during the 
rash of explosions last summer that prompted the united states and 
other nations to send mine sweepers 
iran was accused of planting the mines as part of its strategy 
in its 8yearold war with iraq 
no mine incidents have been reported since the us warship 
samuel b roberts hit one in the gulf in april 
the area where the fatima blew up is roughly where the kuwaiti 
tankers flying the american flag assemble for escort by us navy 
warships through the strait of hormuz and up to kuwait 
kuwait reflagged the 11 tankers in the united states last summer 
to obtain us protection from iranian attacks 
an iranian envoy to the gulf arab capitals recently said he 
expected that kuwait would call soon for an end to the escort 
operations because of irans acceptance last month of a yearold 
un ceasefire resolution 
the un secretarygeneral is negotiating with iraq and iran to 
implement the resolution

a former daycare teacher who sexually 
abused 19 preschoolers has been sentenced to 47 years in prison 
after a mother of one of the victims told the judge our lives 
will never be the same 
margaret kelly michaels who must serve 14 years before she is 
eligible for parole said before her sentencing tuesday that prayer 
and faith in god would help clear her name in an appeal 
i have confidence in the appeals court to vindicate me said 
ms michaels who sat impassively during her sentencing i have 
spent a lot of time in prayer and especially spent time praying 
for those bearing false witness against me 
i declare today as i declared over three years ago i 
declare my innocence 
ms michaels attorneys were preparing to file her appeal today 
superior court judge william f harth imposed the sentence after 
a threehour hearing that included a call by a spokeswoman for 
parents of the victims to have the 26yearold former drama teacher 
imprisoned for life 
our lives have changed drastically and dramatically in the 
last three years the mother of one of the victims said tearfully 
on behalf of the other parents our lives will never be the 
same 
harth ordered the news media not to use the mothers name 
his sentence especially the minimum parole term clearly upset 
parents who declined comment 
ms michaels of pittsburgh was convicted april 16 on 115 counts 
of sexually abusing 19 children ages 3 to 5 while they were in 
her care at the nowdefunct wee care day nursery in suburban 
maplewood from october 1984 to april 1985 she also was convicted 
of endangering the welfare of a 20th child 
prosecutors said during the trial that ms michaels performed 
sexual acts on the children with kitchen utensils forced them to 
perform sexual acts on her and engaged in sex play such as having 
the children pile atop one another while nude prosecutors also 
alleged she played jingle bells for the children on the piano 
while nude 
the facts in this case are sordid bizarre and demeaning to 
these children harth said before he imposed the sentence that 
included fines of 2875 against ms michaels 
defense attorney harvey meltzer said the appeal of the 
conviction would be on the basis that children testified against 
ms michaels on videotape in june the us supreme court 
overturned the sex conviction of an iowa man who was behind a 
shield when two teenage girls testified against him the high 
court held that victims and defendants must confront each other in 
court 
meltzer said his client was prepared for a harsher sentence 
parents milling about after the sentence declined to be 
interviewed but complained to one another about what they 
considered to be a short parole eligibility term 
ms michaels was convicted of 34 counts of firstdegree 
aggravated sexual assault 39 counts of seconddegree sexual 
assault one count of seconddegree attempted aggravated assault 
39 counts of thirddegree endangering the welfare of a child and 
two counts of thirddegree terroristic threats 
the firstdegree convictions each carried a maximum sentence of 
20 years the seconddegree convictions 10 years apiece and the 
thirddegree convictions five years 
specifically ms michaels received two 20year terms and one 
sevenyear term to run consecutively she was scheduled to remain 
in the essex county jail annex at least until todays bail hearing

signed last year city officials believed the arrangement would

peacocks and peahens have 
peaturbed a lot of residents here so the city council voted to 
buy traps to help catch some of the colorful birds 
the peafowl population has increased since 1984 when a forest 
fire in the area reduced the number of coyotes roaming the area 
before that coyotes kept the peafowl population down by preying on 
them 
the birds known for their fanlike tails have been causing 
problems for residents in the north part of the city nestled at 
the foot of the san gabriel mountains just north of los angeles 
robert barrow who led the drive against the peacocks said he 
has spent 200 so far this year to replace vegetation eaten by the 
birds in his yard 
my wife buys plants i dig the hole she plants them and the 
peacocks tear them up he said if some people want to keep 
peacocks they should keep them on a leash 
the boxlike traps will be loaned to residents who can catch the 
animals and turn them over to the wildlife way station 
people have a right to take action just as if they were 
bothered by gophers or skunks mayor joan feehan said when the 
council acted on the trap purchases monday night

the health care financing administration to regulate physicians 
office labs that test 5000 specimens or more starting in 1990

an attorney for one of two people 
acquitted in a federal aliensmuggling trial says jurors will 
always find sanctuary workers innocent if they legally can 
they dont want to have someone who is doing good who is 
trying to help a refugee in need to be a felon said karen 
snell a san francisco attorney who has worked on sanctuaryrelated 
cases in arizona and texas 
she was one of three lawyers for the rev glen remerthamert a 
lutheran who with freelance journalist demetria martinez was 
acquitted tuesday of smuggling two pregnant salvadoran women into 
the united states in august 1986 
remerthamerts defense revolved around a proclamation issued in 
march 1986 by thengov toney anaya who declared new mexico a 
sanctuary state the sanctuary movement started in the early 1980s 
to aid central american refugees largely from el salvador and 
guatemala the proclamation was rescinded in 1987 when garrey 
carruthers became governor 
anaya said tuesday the defense hinged on whether remerthamert 
believed the proclamation had legal effect 
it did not but the issue was whether he believed it did he 
said 
the proclamation was symbolic anaya said adding i made that 
clear at the time 
still he said he hoped the verdicts will prod federal 
prosecutors religious leaders and political leaders in washington 
into reevaluating what we are doing in central america 
us attorney william lutz said the acquittals would have no 
effect on his offices prosecution of similar cases 
we felt there was good evidence the salvadoran women entered 
illegally and were transported illegally i dont think anyone can 
argue with that he said 
but the question was one of intent and the jury disagreed with 
our position on what the intent was 
the prosecution contended the two salvadorans were not refugees 
because they came to the united states to give up their babies for 
adoption and to work and because they intended to return to el 
salvador 
but defense attorney alice hector said most refugees intend to 
return to their native land sometime she said that to say someone 
cant be a refugee if they intend to go back ignores the concept of 
temporary residency inherent in refugee status 
the sanctuary movement contends that under international law and 
the 1980 refugee act people from wartorn areas are entitled to 
enter the united states and live here until conditions improve in 
their homes 
remerthamert said after his acquittal he hopes immigration 
authorities will grant the two salvadoran women refugee status and 
allow them to stay in this country 
the jury deliberated 4 hours over two days before acquitting 
remerthamert and ms martinez on all counts 
juror antoinette tellez 23 said the jury relied heavily on 
anayas sanctuary proclamation it all came down to intent she 
said i think this would have been a different case without the 
sanctuary proclamation 
juror yvette carrillo said the government had a poor case and 
the jury was swayed by the sanctuary proclamation arguments in the 
case of remerthamert she also said jurors agreed from the start 
of deliberations that ms martinez was along solely as a reporter

condemned men can appeal to president ramaswamy venkataraman for 
mercy 
satwant singh and another bodyguard beant singh shot mrs 
gandhi to death in the garden of her new delhi residence beant 
singh also a sikh was shot and killed by other security guards 
just after the assassination 
the manner in which she mrs gandhi was mercilessly attacked 
repels any consideration of reduction in the sentence of 
satwant singh said justice gl oza the senior judge on the 
panel 
in this view of the matter even the conspirator who inspired 
the persons who actually acted does not deserve any leniency in 
the matter of sentence he said 
prosecutors had proved charges of conspiracy against kehar 
singh the maternal uncle of beant singh he said 
the three defendants are not related singh which means 
lion in the punjabi language is part of every sikh males name by 
doctrine of the minority faith 
the supreme court was ringed by policemen wielding automatic 
rifles to prevent any attacks by sikh terrorists visitors to the 
courtroom were frisked and forced to pass through a metal detector 
i am very pleased with the judgement swaran singh the 
brother of balbir singh said outside the court they caught an 
innocent man but now justice has been done 
the chief defense lawyer ram jethmalani was not present but 
his daughter rani who is also his junior partner said the 
court has vindicated us 
balbir singh was just roped in by the overzealousness of the 
police with the collusion of the government she said the sikh 
community should feel that finally the supreme court has given them 
some justice 
mrs gandhi was slain in revenge for an indian army raid on the 
sikhs golden temple in amritsar the previous june at least 1200 
people died in the attack most of them sikhs 
the slaying triggered antisikh riots in new delhi and other 
northern cities in which more than 2000 people were killed most 
of the victims were sikhs mrs gandhis son rajiv gandhi 
succeeded her as prime minister 
sikh radicals have been fighting since 1982 for a separate state 
in the northern indian state of punjab where amrisar is located 
they say sikhs are discriminated against by hindus who are more 
than 80 percent of indias 800 million people sikhs form about 2 
percent of the population but are a majority in punjab 
the army raid on the golden temple sikhisms holiest shrine 
was meant to drive out sikh radicals who took refuge there 
the militant movement has grown and more than 1600 people have 
been killed this year in attacks blamed on sikh militants

after weeks of wrangling the city 
council reversed its decision to name a park after a former ku klux 
klan leader but granted him a plaque in a compromise angering 
blacks and klan members 
the council which includes two black members voted unanimously 
tuesday to name the ballfield veterans park and to place a 
marker at the park noting that james r venable a stone mountain 
resident since 1936 and a former mayor donated the land for the 
park in the 1940s 
venable the 83yearold former imperial wizard of the national 
knights of the ku klux klan accused the city leaders of giving in 
to pressure from liberal pinko communist types the vice 
president of the dekalb county naacp called the new name an 
insult to all veterans 
outside an angry crowd of 100 including members of the dekalb 
county national association for the advancement of colored people 
knocked on windows demanding to get into the meeting which was 
closed because of a capacity crowd 
however many in a quiet audience of 30 inside the council 
chambers which included at least one klansman broke into applause 
after the vote 
venable did not attend the meeting but heard the news from a 
parking lot outside city hall 
im disappointed with them i knew they were weakkneed my 
own race is weakkneed he said 
naacp members were not happy either 
my preference is to not have his name associated with the park 
at all said coleman seward vice president of the dekalb naacp 
its an insult to all veterans black white and jewish to 
have his name associated with the park its a disgrace 
the city council voted unanimously on july 12 to name the park 
after him apparently not expecting the ensuing media coverage and 
public outcry from civil rights groups and some residents 
at the time robert smith one of the black council members 
said he favored the move because venables past affiliation was 
not my concern 
because of the controversy venable wrote mayor jane rhodes 
three days later asking the city to rescind the action and she 
agreed 
but within 1 weeks he changed his mind and wrote the mayor and 
six council members again asking them to name the park after him 
after all 
gloria brown a black resident who attended the meeting said 
she would have been happy if the council stuck with its original 
decision to name the ballfield venable park 
hes a citizen of this town and hes done wonderful things for 
this town she said if hes a member of the klan its his 
private business im a staunch member of the naacp 
the council shouldve named a park after jimmy venable years 
and years ago for what hes done for this town said e bill 
fitzgerald who wore a faded gold klan robe and described himself 
as imperial wizard of the invisible empire of the knights of the ku 
klux klan

a new blast of scorching weather in the nations midsection has 
increased fears about fall crops that are already wilting from 
thirst and experts say the effects of the drought may extend into 
next year 
despite scattered july showers farmers say it will now take an 
exceptional amount of rain the rest of the year to make up for the 
huge moisture deficit caused by the hot dry spring and summer 
weve never had temperatures like this that i can recall id 
say were going downhill real quick if it stays hot said indiana 
farmer dan donathen who tends 300 acres of corn and soybeans 
id say were in a real blowtorch pressurecooker right now 
temperatures soared tuesday to tie or break records in 26 cities 
in 12 states wisconsin minnesota michigan illinois ohio iowa 
indiana south carolina north carolina west virginia tennessee 
and new york according to the national weather service 
in wisconsin the city of la crosse broke a 24yearold record 
for the date with 102 degrees and tied a 1955 mark with its 35th 
day of temperatures in the 90s or hotter columbia hospital in 
milwaukee treated 86 heatrelated cases in a 24hour period monday 
and tuesday its normal amount for an entire summer is 56 hospital 
officials said 
minneapolisst paul set a mark of 101 degrees and chicago hit 
100 for a record the seventh time this year 
it was so hot i had to go outside to breathe said 
willie nabors who abandoned his unairconditioned milwaukee 
apartment tuesday to join thousands of other sufferers in a cool 
shopping mall 
in the detroit area hundreds of chrysler corp workers felt the 
same way walking off their jobs at three factories when 
temperatures reached up to 140 degrees near furnaces united auto 
workers union officials said 
farmers meanwhile caught between the heat and drought worried 
about what the weather conditions might do to their crop yield next 
year 
the key times for recharging are late fall and early spring 
said ken kunkel director of the midwestern climate center in 
champaign ill if we have a very dry fall we will be in more 
danger next spring 
that makes melting winter snow and early spring rain even more 
critical in 1989 
its going to be tough to go into the spring with adequate 
soil moisture said larry dallas who farms 560 acres in central 
illinois with his brother 
what corn there is the rain helped and weve got some decent 
sized ears said dallas who still expects no more than half a 
crop the soybeans perked up and grew a foot but if it gets hot 
and dry again well lose all weve gained 
in carroll county iowa however some farmers with 
betterthanaverage rainfall were relishing the potential payoff 
from grain prices pushed higher by the parched conditions 
weve hit the jackpot at the end of the rainbow county 
extension director dennis molitor said tuesday its definitely a 
potential gain for a lot of producers 
rain has soaked many fields in parts of illinois indiana ohio 
and kentucky in recent weeks however other parts of illinois 
iowa wisconsin and minnesota remained relatively dry kunkel said 
certainly the drought is not over said kunkel soil 
moisture reserves are very limited 
latejuly showers were also welcome in kentucky and arkansas 
its looking a whole lot better said kentucky farmer homer 
hurst jr we actually cut some hay yesterday we reseeded 65 
acres of corn and were hoping for a late fall 
but farmers in other drought states have not been as fortunate 
in south dakota experts said rains came too late to save most 
crops and the state approved a program to help farmers and ranchers 
replace driedup water supplies 
its the same old story we need rain were not getting 
any said herb halvorson assistant agriculture commissioner in 
minnesota who indicated heat now may be causing more damage than 
drought 
the impact on the corn and the soybeans and the canning crops 
has been devastating

the governing party chose a young political 
scientist as its general secretary in what appeared to be the 
beginning of a major leadership shakeup after a poor showing in 
recent elections 
at a carefully planned meeting tuesday night the institutional 
revolutionary party partys national executive committee accepted 
the resignation of veteran humberto lugo gil and unanimously named 
manuel camacho solis to replace him 
camacho solis 42 is a close friend and associate of victorious 
presidential candidate carlos salinas de gortari his selection 
followed a promise by salinas to modernize and streamline the 
party which has been in power in mexico since it was founded in 
1929 
camacho solis promised in his acceptance speech to bring new 
blood to the party leadership which has been little more than a 
closed club of politicians 
salinas 40 won the presidential election july 6 with about 50 
percent of the vote but for the first time in decades he was 
strongly challenged by two opposition candidates cuauhtemoc 
cardenas of the leftist national democratic front coalition and 
manuel j clouthier of the conservative national action party 
cardenas who came in second and clouthier in third place 
claim widespread fraud and have challenged the returns of the 
presidential and house and senate elections which were held 
simultaneously 
the federal election commission and the election tribunal which 
oversaw the balloting rejected most of the opposition complaints 
and congress is expected to proclaim salinas presidentelect in 
september he is to succeed president miguel de la madrid for a 
sixyear term dec 1 
but the accusations of fraud sparked widespread irritation among 
voters it was also the first time the governing party won a major 
election with less than 70 percent of the vote 
also for the first time the party lost its absolute control of 
the senate cardenas coalition won four of the upper chambers 64 
seats 
a few days after the election salinas said that the time of a 
oneparty system in mexico is over and said his party will have 
to learn to live with a growing opposition and compete harder in 
honest elections 
lugo gil ostensibly resigned because his native state of hidalgo 
elected him to a senate seat but his replacement was viewed as 
following salinas wish to fill key posts within the party and his 
administration with people who share his views 
camacho solis said it is vital that we appear before society 
practising an opendoor policy for all not for members of the 
party but for the whole of society

a jury has convicted two navajos in the 
shooting and burning deaths of two tribal police officers but 
couldnt agree on a verdict for a third defendant who now faces a 
murder retrial 
the federal jury on tuesday found thomas cly 22 and vinton 
bedoni 31 guilty of two counts of firstdegree murder and two 
counts of using a firearm in the december killings 
prosecutors said they would seek a new murder trial for the 
third defendant ben atene jr 
atene 22 must be retried within 70 days under federal speedy 
trial rules he was being held without bail in the salt lake county 
jail 
the people on the navajo reservation were watching to see 
whether white mans justice worked said us attorney brent 
ward who added he had never been so pleased with a case since 
taking his post 
ward said atenes next trial might be aided by more witnesses 
who in light of the two convictions might admit to being at the 
murder scene 
us district judge thomas greene set sentencing for cly and 
bedoni for oct 3 the firstdegree murder charges each carry a 
possible life sentence and the weapons charges carry five years 
the jury deliberated 48 hours before convicting cly and bedoni 
greene then ordered the jurors to continue deliberations for atene 
when they were unable to come to a decision 90 minutes later 
greene declared a mistrial in atenes case greene denied a defense 
request to acquit atene 
firstdegree murder charges were dismissed july 22 against 
atenes 22yearold brother marques atene when prosecutors 
acknowledged they didnt have enough evidence for a conviction 
the defendants were charged in the slayings of officers roy lee 
stanley and andy begay whose charred bodies were found dec 5 
inside a burnedout police truck in a remote southern utah canyon 
during the trial prosecution witnesses testified that the 
officers were shot at the scene of a bonfire and drinking party on 
the night of dec 4 alcohol is illegal on the reservation 
defense attorney robert vansciver said he planned to discuss the 
possibility of appeal with his client bedoni attorney ed brass 
said he was certain cly would challenge his conviction 
the verdict brought relief and sadness to marie holiday whose 
brother was stanley 
ive been thinking about my brother roy all during this 
trial she said i kept thinking about him so i have this 
mixed feeling and i dont know how to describe it 
the killings have divided the community of about 2000 navajos 
living in monument valley in southeastern utah she said and she 
and her family have been ostracized by many of their neighbors 
they all wept with us when my brother died but then when 
these people were arrested for it they all turned the other way 
she said

the drought has kept the mighty mississippi from 
rolling along but its helped profits roll in for illinois central 
railroad thanks to the troubles of its rival barge haulers the 
railroads chairman said 
while barges have been stranded in shallow water the illinois 
central whose tracks have paralleled the river for 137 years has 
been chugging along bringing grain and coal from illinois to the 
south 
this is probably the first time since the railroad started in 
1851 that weve made a profit in july and were off to a rather 
rousing start in august harry j bruce chairman and chief 
executive of the railroad said tuesday 
he attributed his companys success to an educated gamble 
last spring before the full impact of the drought was felt in 
the midwest the railroad hired weather forecasters and other 
consultants to study mississippi river water levels bruce said 
after the consultants concluded the drought would make the year 
difficult for barge operators who depend on deep water to move 
their towboats the railroad began stockpiling rail cars and other 
equipment 
the illinois central spent 700000 to lease about 600 cars 
primarily covered hopper cars to handle grain from as far away as 
canada bruce said its fleet increased by almost 20 percent in 
july a traditionally slow month for the railroad 
it was a reasoned educated gamble and it has paid off 
handsomely said bruce we keep a close eye on whats going on 
on the river because its a main competitive force for us 
the railroads operating income for the second quarter of 1988 
was 20 million compared with 12 million for the period last 
year or a 67 percent increase 
joseph farrell president of the american waterways operators 
said monday that drought conditions on the mississippi will cause 
the inland barging companies to lose 150 million to 200 million 
in revenue between june 15 and sept 30 
in july the illinois central moved 71075 carloads of freight 
a 12 percent increase over last year bruce said the biggest 
increase was in corn and soybean shipments which totaled 10221 
cars in july compared with only 5995 cars in july 1987 
coal shipments were up by 482 percent and chemical shipments by 
8 percent for the same period 
bruce said the railroad plans to keep its leased cars at least 
into the early part of next year the railroads consultants 
predict the low river levels will last into the winter causing ice 
jams to form earlier than usual and spread even farther down the 
river than normal bruce said 
the current low water levels reflect a 10year trend in which 
the mississippi has dropped steadily due to reduced snowfalls and 
rain he added 
weve seen for some time now that ol man river hasnt been 
rolling along so well 
even so the us geological survey reported that the 
mississippis water level jumped a surprising 10 percent in the 
twin cities area in only five hours tuesday the result of rainfall 
in northern minnesota during the past few days

the worlds anglican bishops adopted 
13 resolutions favoring closer relations with other christian 
churches in just 2 hours 45 minutes of debate 
the bishops meeting for the first time in 10 years got through 
the agenda headed ecumenical concerns tuesday the 17th day of 
the 22day lambeth conference in canterbury 
leaders of 70 million anglicans in 164 countries who form the 
worlds second largest christian group have debated for more than 
20 years how they might eventually close ranks with the roman 
catholic orthodox lutheran methodist baptist and other churches 
a separate resolution noted the rapid growth of pentecostal 
churches worldwide and said personal contact and theological 
dialogue also should be encouraged with those churches 
we want to be one because jesus christ founded only one 
church said canon christopher hill secretary for ecumenical 
affairs to archbishop of canterbury robert runcie the anglican 
leader 
the state church of england with the monarch as temporal head 
was created in the 16th century when king henry viii broke with 
rome after pope clement vii refused him a divorce from catherine of 
aragon but it has always considered itself the direct inheritor of 
14 centuries of christianity in britain 
about 30 observers from other churches are at the conference 
including two roman catholic bishops and a member of the vatican 
secretariat for promoting christian unity the rev kevin mcdonald 
a stumbling block to a united christian church is its leader 
protestants say 
anglican theologians say they probably would be ready to 
recognize the primacy of the pope leader of the worlds 700 
million roman catholics 
but one observer the rev dr david s russell general 
secretary of britains baptist union told reporters that primacy 
will have to be something very very different from the present 
primacy of the pope 
the bishops broke off the debate to appeal for the release of 
all hostages in lebanon their plea came after it was disclosed 
that us australian and english bishops have pressed contacts in 
iran lebanon and the united states to get the captives freed 
eighteen westerners are missing including anglican envoy terry 
waite and the bishops have sought to persuade iran to use its 
influence with the proiranian hezbollah group believed to hold the 
hostages 
nine americans are among those held hostage the longest held is 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press he was abducted march 16 1985 
us episcopal bishop robert c witcher of long island who 
reported he has held talks with iranian officials in the united 
states since april 8 said he expected the hostages would be 
released by the end of this year 
meanwhile the bishop of london graham leonard said tuesday 
night he may fall out of communion with runcie if runcie recognizes 
women bishops 
leonard is the church of englands leading opponent of women 
priests and bishops on monday the allmale bishops approved a 
compromise resolution on the issue 
in effect it recognized that nothing can be done to prevent 
anglican churches in the united states canada and new zealand from 
consecrating the first woman bishop after ordaining hundreds of 
women priests 
the resolution said the 27 selfgoverning anglican churches 
should respect such a move and that a commission headed by runcie 
be set up to prepare guidelines for it

voters resurrected the political career of a 
millionaire excongressman while a congressman who boasted about 
his certainty of victory wound up winning by a smaller margin than 
expected in the michigan primary 
jim dunn who served one term in congress then lost 1982 1984 
and 1986 bids for a return to washington won the republican 
partys nomination for us senate by defeating another millionaire 
oneterm congressman robert huber 
the prize the right to take on democratic sen donald riegle 
who hasnt lost an election in 22 years 
voters on tuesday also put on the books a statute prohibiting 
casinos within detroit city limits if they ever are legalized by 
the state legislature 
in the only lively congressional race democrat george crockett 
had a close call in his bid for renomination 
with 50 percent of the vote counted crockett edged detroit city 
councilwoman barbararose collins 46 percent to 40 percent in a 
fourperson race 
collins ran an aggressive campaign criticizing the eightyear 
incumbent as a dolittle outoftouch legislator who failed to 
improve conditions for residents of the district 
crockett bragged that he was so sure of victory he didnt open a 
campaign office and didnt make a single campaign speech 
dunn whose margin of victory was 61 percent to 39 percent was 
equally confident 
we started the fall campaign in february he said we said 
all along that our target was don riegle 
dunns road to victory was paved with his own money and a change 
in tactics 
when he unsuccessfully ran for the senate nomination in 1984 he 
alienated voters with sharp attacks on his opponent and alienated 
party regulars by condemning their support of exastronaut jack 
lousma in 1986 he ran a hardnosed campaign against democratic 
rep robert carr earning him the epithet junkyard dog 
he began his 1988 senate bid by announcing there was a new jim 
dunn who would take the high road in campaigning and he made an 
effort to make peace with the party activists and contributors he 
had castigated four years earlier 
his efforts and the belief that huber was too conservative to 
unseat riegle earned dunn the endorsements of virtually every 
prominent republican in the state 
huber attracted the only real attention of the primary race with 
his declaration on acquired immune deficiency syndrome if it 
isnt the wrath of god it should be

firefighters who were denied a forecast rainfall pumped water 
from lakes in yellowstone national park to head off a blaze that 
still flickered toward old faithful while a windwhipped fire 
consumed a lone mountainside in oregon 
in montana and idaho a cool front from canada supplied 
firefighters with two needed tools lower temperatures and higher 
humidity as well as a light wind in montana 
yellowstone firefighters meanwhile took advantage of the 
parks natural resources to cool off some of its largest forest 
fires 
helicopters with 700gallon buckets drew water from lewis lake 
inside the park and hebgen lake nearby and dropped the moisture on 
three fires including a 17700acre blaze that burned about eight 
miles west of the old faithful geyser 
the water drop was successful in keeping the fire away from the 
tourist attraction said fire information officer larry blade he 
said the blaze was 66 percent contained by tuesday afternoon and 
total containment was expected by friday 
a forecast for rain however yielded none its all gone to 
canada on us said fire information officer earl laorange 
about 750 firefighters kept busy attempting to contain a second 
major yellowstone fire that has consumed more than 145500 acres of 
parkland 
in oregon a windfanned forest fire late tuesday rapidly spread 
to more than 500 acres on privately owned mountainous forest land 
much of it inaccessible to firefighters officials said 
the fire on land owned by weyerhaeuser co was fueled by slash 
stands of young fir and recently harvested timber waiting to be 
trucked out said doug decker a spokesman for the state forestry 
department 
its burning on real steep kind of isolated terrain decker 
said its difficult to move heavy equipment in that kind of 
area the limited access certainly has affected it 
in the boise national forest near cascade firefighters pushed 
toward full containment of the 200acre riordan lake fire aided by 
cooler temperatures and higher humidity 
fire managers in montana predicted that the 3200acre rock 
creek fire would be contained by this morning after being held in 
check tuesday by 871 firefighters and the canadian cool front

chinese farmers whose only child is a girl are 
now allowed to have a second child in the hope that they have a 
boy a family planning official said today 
the policy marks a break from chinas usual program of limiting 
each couple to only one child 
li yong a spokesman for the state birth control commission 
said china was now permitting peasants in almost every province 
to have a second child if their first was a girl 
peasants make up 80 percent of chinas 107 billion people 
an official at the united nations fund for population activities 
said the move was unusual because china recently has taken steps to 
enforce its one family one child policy 
but relaxation on this issue might give them a justification 
to crack down harder on other population issues said manfred 
kulessa head of that un office in beijing 
li said the new policy was adopted because too many peasants 
were ignoring the onechild limit after they had a girl 
the peasants belief that boys were economically more productive 
than girls and chinese superstitions favoring male children were 
main reasons the onechild policy has not worked he said 
li said the policy change would not greatly affect chinas 
population growth because only 19 percent of chinas families have 
one child 
our real problems are with the families that have three five 
and even seven children he said we need to concentrate on 
those now 
li acknowledged that some families abandon girls on sunday the 
china youth news reported the number of abandoned children found in 
beijing was increasing at an alarming rate 
in 1987 it said 151 children were abandoned in the city the 
annual average over the previous five years was around 81 the 
report said most of the abandoned children were healthy girls or 
handicapped children of both sexes 
since economic reforms began in 1978 china has been trying to 
limit each family to one child 
china is also in the midst of a baby boom that has seen the 
population growth rate jump from 11 percent in 1985 to 14 percent 
in 1987 if the growth rate continues chinas population could 
swell to 15 billion by 2010 
in february china announced stringent measures to control 
growth including a system allocating bonuses to local officials if 
they kept the population of their area down and penalizing them if 
the population grows too fast 
li said families would be permitted to have only one extra child 
after that they will be subject to the same fines as everybody 
else he said 
fines for having too many children vary from region to region 
but generally amount to 270 or more per year for five years about 
twice the average rural income 
in recent years increasingly affluent peasants have had the 
money to pay the fines 
why be afraid of a fine goes one poem a sum of money is 
a dead treasure but a son is a live treasure

commonwealth foreign ministers are considering 
measures to pressure south africa to end apartheid ranging from 
army uniforms for mozambique to a boycott of banks loaning money to 
south africa 
over britains objections the 49nation commonwealth set up a 
committee of eight foreign envoys to review the effect of sanctions 
against south africa and put pressure on it to grant full rights to 
the black majority 
the panel ends two days of talks today the commonwealth groups 
britain and former colonies 
nigerias former head of state maj gen olusegun obasanjo 
told reporters tuesday that mozambique and the commonwealth states 
around south africa which he toured in march and april requested 
nonlethal items ranging from army uniforms for mozambique to 
spare aircraft parts for tanzania he declined to list weapons 
sought but said canada and other western countries were not asked 
to supply arms 
lethal items will be very difficult for any democratic 
political leadership in the west to sell said obasanjo 
but he added as a former military man the distinction 
between lethal and nonlethal aid is semantic because food can be 
lethal an army marches on a full stomach 
he said most of the countries need transportation and 
communications equipment clothing and medical supplies after south 
african raids 
commonwealth officials said botswana asked for assistance in 
training its police force and zimbabwe requested aerial photo 
equipment 
obasanjo singled out mozambique as the most needy and said it 
was senseless for canada to provide aid about 16 million for 
the construction of the limpopo railway line without paying to 
protect it from south african sabotage 
the railway will provide an alternative seaward route for 
landlocked zimbabwe zambia and botswana making them less 
dependent on south africa 
foreign minister joe clark said canada will not provide military 
aid but might donate items such as communications equipment and 
uniforms 
britain is firmly opposed to sanctions against south africa but 
is providing military training for zimbabwe and mozambique 
its prime minister margaret thatcher criticized the 
commonwealth ministers and said she would always shrink from 
economic sanctions because they hurt south african blacks 
the enormous problems that country has of getting rid of 
apartheid will not be helped by a comfortable luncheon in a 
fivestar hotel deciding there should be poverty and starvation on 
the part of a large number of black people she said in canberra 
australia 
she said big foreign companies were helping to break down 
apartheid by building racially integrated housing and paying 
employees on merit 
also at the meeting the foreign ministers of canada australia 
guyana india nigeria tanzania zambia and zimbabwe discussed a 
report on south africas international financial links reviewed 
the effect of sanctions and examined the poorly enforced arms 
embargo against pretoria 
the finance report said the refusal of major world banks to loan 
new funds to south africa has had the biggest effect 
it also spelled out possible new sanctions the commonwealth 
could adopt including a boycott of all banks making new loans to 
south africa an international ban on export credit insurance 
guarantees and restrictions on trade credits 
any recommendations from the group must go to the entire 
commonwealth which meets again in malaysia next year

late teamsters president jackie presser worked 
as an fbi informant as early as 1974 and was valued for his 
knowledge of mob attempts to control the union according to 
records released in us district court 
oliver b revell executive assistant director of investigations 
for the fbi in washington said presser remained on the informant 
list until he became international teamsters president in 1983 
presser was then removed from the official informant list but 
continued to give information to the fbi voluntarily revell said 
the transcript of a june 20 interview of revell by attorneys for 
presser and two codefendants in a criminal case also revealed 
tuesday that thenfbi director william webster had warned he would 
reveal pressers role as an informant to a senate committee in 1983 
if presser denied such a role 
webster did not follow through with his threat however because 
the committee never asked presser whether he was an informant 
presser was known to the fbi by the code name all pro 
according to documents he was valued as an informant to the 
government because of his knowledge of underworld attempts to 
control the teamsters 
revell discussing the period after pressers election said the 
union chief continued to contact our agents which we did not 
discourage with information but its on a selfinitiated basis 
the document containing the revell interview was filed by paul 
j cambria a buffalo lawyer representing harold friedman 
president of teamsters local 507 in cleveland and a codefendant 
with anthony hughes the locals recording secretary on federal 
racketeering and embezzlement charges 
presser also had been indicted on such charges in connection 
with an alleged 700000 payrollpadding scheme at local 507 the 
government dropped the same charges against presser after he died 
early last month

present his film young toscanini at the venice film festival 
unless the screening of martin scorseses the last temptation of 
christ is rescheduled 
the two films are due to be shown one day after the other with 
scorseses movie coming first on sept 7 
i want more distance between the two films he said in a 
telephone interview with the associated press i dont want to be 
caught up in the fights the storm the polemics that will follow 
the screening of scorseses film 
it is a question of scheduling and i put scheduling as a 
condition for the presentation of young toscanini he said 
zeffirelli who directed the television miniseries jesus of 
nazareth several years ago added that his new film might not be 
ready for venice anyway because of technical reasons 
my film is not ready yet and in order to have it completed in 
time for presentation at the festival there would have to be great 
enthusiasm zeffirelli said but enthusiasm has grown fainter 
because of this recent controversy 
zeffirelli said scorseses film is damaging to the image of 
christ he cannot be made the object of low fantasies 
scorseses film also has prompted criticism from the christian 
democrats the dominant group in italys fiveparty government 
coalition for the portrayal of jesus christ fantasizing about 
making love to mary magdalene 
the film has also provoked pickets and protests in the united 
states 
zeffirellis young toscanini stars american c thomas howell 
as the conductor as a young man elizabeth taylor plays a 
supporting role 
both films are scheduled to be shown in the special events 
division which is outside the competition category for films

two burmese rebel groups battling over 
the right to tax smugglers left hundreds killed or wounded in 11 
days of fierce fighting near the thai border officials said today 
two senior thai provincial officials said the fighting began on 
july 23 when hundreds of karen rebels pounded the mon rebels at 
ban chedi or pagoda village with mortars and rocketpropelled 
grenades they said many civilians were killed or wounded in the 
threehour assault 
the officials said fighting died down today with both sides 
short of ammunition and food but that about 500 karen guerrillas 
still were besieging about 300 mon rebels 
the village is in southeastern mon state and opposite the thai 
village of three pagoda pass in kanchanaburi province about 175 
miles northwest of bangkok 
the officials quoting military intelligence reports spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the karen and the mon are two of about a dozen ethnic minority 
groups who have been fighting the burmese government for four 
decades for greater autonomy both maintain their strongholds along 
burmas eastern border with thailand and both generally have 
cooperated with each other using the same smuggling routes 
but the fighting erupted after karen rebels said armed mon 
guerrillas demanded protection money from karen civilians who 
passed through moncontrolled areas to engage in illegal trade with 
thai villagers 
the mons said the karens extorted similar taxes from mon 
civilians passing through karencontrolled areas the thai 
officials said 
the officials said fire broke out in the village market during 
the july 23 attack and smoke could be seen from the thai side of 
the border 
the karens then got reinforcements from other rebel groups to 
try to capture the village but the mons fought back they said 
the most recent big clash was on sunday when the karens again 
attacked with mortars and rocketpropelled grenades setting the 
village market ablaze the attack lasted 30 minutes the thai 
officials said 
thai intelligence officers who crossed the border after sundays 
fighting and walked near the besieged village said they smelled the 
stench of rotting corpses 
the provincial officials said one thai soldier was killed and 
another soldier wounded by mortar fire that strayed into thailand 
during the fighting 
thai officials said border patrol policemen and soldiers were 
dispatched to the frontier to push back hundreds of burmese 
civilians who tried to cross into thailand to escape the fighting 
about 300 thais living in the border area have been moved further 
away they said 
the mons and the karens have been fighting burma since it gained 
its independence from britain in 1948 they contend the government 
has reneged on pledges to grant autonomy to ethnic groups 
among burmas 38 million people there are about 3 million 
karens and 13 million mons both are predominately buddhist 
although the karen elite is mainly christian

nurses were flown in from elsewhere in 
california and from out of state as officials promised quality care 
at six area hospitals despite a strike by about 2000 registered 
nurses 
we feel we are able to operate with some reductions but 
still are able to offer our range of services said dr kenneth 
hammerman chief of staff at st francis memorial hospital 
the nurses demanding higher pay and regular raises for veteran 
employees walked off the job tuesday morning ten other hospitals 
in san francisco remain unaffected 
the six hospitals continued operating caring for about 900 
patients with management employees and temporary nurses officials 
said 
the hospitals which negotiated as a group called affiliated 
hospitals of san francisco also transferred some patients 
consolidated some criticalcare units and referred some patients 
elsewhere 
hospital officials declined to say how many nurses were flown 
in california nurses association spokeswoman maureen anderson 
estimated the number at 20 to 30 
the walkout which occurred after the nurses rejected a 
lastminute revised offer was the first widespread strike by 
registered nurses here since 1974 no new talks were scheduled 
hardest hit was the 61bed marshall hale hospital in san 
francisco where the emergency room was closed operations canceled 
and no new patients were being admitted 
nurses on the picket lines questioned the qualifications of 
temporary workers and the quality of patient care 
common sense tells me i would not go to an affiliated hospital 
with nearly 4000 workers on strike anderson said 
affected hospitals were st francis marshall hale childrens 
mount zion and st marys in san francisco and seton medical center 
in daly city 
the nurses want an 11 percent raise the first year and 10 
percent the second year of a twoyear contract affiliated 
hospitals late monday offered 18 percent over 31 months 
registered nurses at affiliated hospitals earn from about 
31000 to about 36000 for day shifts and up to 43000 a year 
for night shifts

the reagan administration has 
ignored a deadline set by the world court to determine how much the 
united states should pay in war reparations to nicaragua a court 
spokesman said today 
in what was seen as another snub to the world court the 
judicial branch of the united nations the us government breached 
the july 29 deadline to present its position in the case which it 
has been boycotting since 1984 
the time limit has lapsed without the receipt of any 
communication from the government of the united states the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
he said the court would now consider the next step in the 
procedure 
nicaraguas ambassador to the netherlands who represents his 
nation at the world court could not be reached for comment an 
embassy spokeswoman told the associated press that all diplomats 
involved in the case are currently on holiday in managua she 
refused to give her name 
the reparations procedure grew out of a 1986 world court ruling 
ordering the united states immediately to halt all support to the 
contra rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
the ruling followed a 1984 complaint by managua that the united 
states was involved in attempts to overthrow the nicaraguan 
government the court said nicaragua was entitled to reparations 
but it did not indicate the amount 
instead it ordered both parties in the dispute to negotiate a 
settlement on the issue and said it would intervene only if such 
talks failed 
the reagan administration which said in 1984 that the world 
court has no jurisdiction in the dispute has refused to consider 
paying reparations to nicaragua 
in november the court opened proceedings to establish the 
amount of reparations nicaragua would be entitled to a month 
later john shad the us ambassador to the netherlands sent a 
letter to the court repeating the administrations position that 
the court has no authority in the case 
that letter was the last official communication received by the 
court from the us government the court spokesman said 
managua has never stated how much it is seeking in compensation 
but sandinista officials privately have estimated the economic 
damage from the contra war at 250 million to 300 million 
nicaraguas arguments in the reparations case were filed in 
march under the courts statutes they are not to be made public 
before hearings are held on the issue it was not immediately clear 
whether the court was planning a public procedure 
the court officially known as the international court of 
justice has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary 
compliance with its rulings

four million sterilized mediterranean fruit 
flies flooded a 16squaremile area in the second stage of a 
campaign to eradicate the threat to californias 14 billionayear 
farm industry 
the male flies the first of a total of 20 million to be freed 
through friday were released tuesday by airplane and from 
cardboard buckets by truck 
the sterile flies dyed fluorescent pink will cause the 
medflies to breed themselves out of existence said robert donley 
deputy director of the county agriculture commission 
last week the suburban san fernando valley area was bombarded 
with aerial and ground applications of the pesticide malathion 
after six medflies were found in traps 
if there are any viable flies that emerge they will mate with 
sterile flies and there will be no offspring donley said 
the sterile flies pink color is invisible to the eye but shows 
up under a special light donley said 
the medfly lays eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and 
vegetables the flies are usually brought in from hawaii on fruit 
carried in by tourists 
no new flies were found monday or tuesday but inspectors 
continued to monitor traps in trees 
flies will be released weekly for about two months about 20 
million each week to cover two potential generations of medflies 
said donley the average lifespan of a medfly is about a month 
the use of sterile flies helped eradicate a medfly infestation 
last summer in eastern los angeles county 
the san fernando valley is about a 100squaremile area that 
includes a number of suburbs northwest of los angeles

scientists at sandia national 
laboratories say they have trained unruly electrons to go straight 
for more than 50 yards in experiments to see if the beams may be 
used as star wars missilekillers 
the experiments were conducted in a 184foot tube that simulates 
conditions in the upper atmosphere the scientists said in todays 
albuquerque journal 
scientists said it is the first time they have gotten 
2millionelectronvolt beams to travel that far 
electron beams can become unstable and whip around violently as 
their negative charges repel each other when they emerge from a 
particle accelerator 
if they could travel in a straight line for long distances they 
might be used to disable incoming warheads or differentiate between 
warheads and decoys as part of the strategic defense initiative or 
star wars said james rice manager of directed energy research at 
sandia 
training the direction of the electron beams has involved using 
a channel of hot electrically charged plasma gas which acts as a 
kind of wire to carry the beams current scientists said 
rice said electron beams can penetrate deep into a target 
deposit their energy and produce xrays analyzing the amount and 
type of xrays yielded by a target could help differentiate between 
a warhead and a decoy he said 
other applications for such beams would include highspeed xray 
photography welding studying the effects of rapid heating and 
simulating the effects of nuclear bursts the scientists said

she was barred from disneyland because her hair was pink and purple 
they dont know what the persons like its just not fair 
tonya slobod said tuesday 
superior court judge tully seymour after the nonjury trial 
did not immediately rule on her request to find that her civil 
rights were violated 
miss slobod wants him to impose a maximum 250 fine under state 
civil rights law plus 2200 in legal fees and unspecified punitive

from our shows miss slobod said she said employees offered to 
let her in if she would cover her head with a cap of some kind she 
said she refused and left 
james rettie security supervisor for the park confirmed 
disneyland has a policy of excluding guests so garish in appearance 
that they detract from shows but he testified that a guest would 
not be excluded on hair color alone 
disneyland attorney richard claire said that the amusement park 
has no record of their visit and that even if they did come to the 
anaheim park disneyland employees must have behaved legally in 
barring miss slobod 
ms egelko produced disneyland parking stubs as evidence that 
the girl visited the park

investigators are checking whether a rare greek 
statue bought by the j paul getty museum was taken from an illegal 
archeological dig in sicily an interpol official said today 
gordon henley director of the international art theft unit for 
interpol said italian authorities notified the parisbased 
international police agency on tuesday that they were looking into 
the origin of the statue on display since last week at the museum 
in malibu calif 
henley said the italian investigators reported in a cable that 
they believe the 7foot6inch statue dating from the 5th century 
bc was probably obtained from an illegal excavation in 
morgantina agrigento sicily 
in rome a senior official of the special carabinieri art theft 
squad today said the team has been investigating the origin of the 
statue for a month 
the probe was requested by graziella fiorentini the 
governments director of cultural affairs in agrigento said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity miss fiorentini 
could not immediately be reached for comment 
the carabinieri are investigating all over italy and interpol 
is investigating too in order to find out who sold the statue to 
the getty museum said the official once the carabinieri 
discover something magistrates will be immediately informed 
interpols role is limited to waiting for italian police to 
confirm their belief that the statue was stolen then relaying the 
information to police in the united states henley said 
the statue believed to represent nike aphrodite or hera was 
described last week when it was put on display as the only such 
fullsize figure to have survived intact and the most remarkable 
ancient sculpture to appear on the art market in years 
the getty museum declined to say from whom it bought the work or 
how much it paid but said it tried to determine whether either 
italy or greece had a claim to the statue 
henley said interpol first became involved last week when it was 
tipped by connoisseur magazine whose editorinchief thomas 
hoving was investigating the getty acquisition 
 
in a copyright story tuesday the international heraldtribune 
reported that miss fiorentini told connoisseur she sent the getty 
museum telegrams warning that she thought the statue was stolen 
 
i have no concrete evidence the piece came from our site 
miss fiorentini was quoted as saying but i couldnt rule it out 
either above all i did not want to say anything that could be 
remotely construed as approval or consent 
the heraldtribune said miss fiorentini spoke to connoisseur on 
saturday and that the magazine made available its findings to be 
published in full in a series beginning with the october issue 
the newspaper quoted getty museum spokeswoman lori starr as 
saying the report came as a surprise 
we made formal inquiries a year ago about the history of the 
statue with the ministry in rome via our lawyer there she was 
quoted as saying this is something were just going to have to 
look into 
the newspaper quoted ms starr as saying getty policy was to 
return an item to the country of origin if a valid legal claim is 
established

the burmese government today imposed 
martial law on the capital of rangoon after thousands of masked 
students marched through downtown shouting slogans denouncing 
leader sein lwin diplomats said 
burmas official radio rangoon announced that the city was 
placed under judicial control of the military at 1 pm to permit 
those students who would like to study peacefully to do so 
the decree did not mention whether a curfew had been imposed on 
rangoons 35 million residents it said martial law would cease 
when the council of state so declares 
the decree signed by president sein lwin said that from july 
28 until tuesday students had demonstrated and distributed 
leaflets at burmas most sacred shrine the shwedagon pagoda 
western diplomats contacted by telephone in rangoon gave an 
eyewitness account of about 3000 young students marching through 
the heart of the city their faces covered with handkerchiefs 
stockings and other masks to prevent identification by authorities 
saffronrobed buddhist monks and large numbers of workers joined 
the students the diplomats said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the diplomats reported no violence or confrontations with 
police unlike bloody riots in march and june they said police 
were not seen today 
they were very well organized very peaceful one diplomat 
said they would form rings around cars so there would be no 
damage 
the witnesses said most protesters appeared to be in their teens 
or to be high school students 
the declaration of martial law came one week after sein lwin 
known for his ruthless suppression of dissidents assumed power 
lwin said moral decay and political corruption have caused citizens 
to lose faith in the government 
sein lwin was elected president and chairman of the ruling burma 
socialist program party on july 26 pamphlets circulating in 
rangoon have branded him a ruthless oppressor and called for his 
overthrow 
the official news agency burma acknowledged that since july 28 
young people have been rallying at shwedagon pagoda to protest 
government leaders 
the agency in a report made available today said 100 to 200 
teenagers hoisted the peacock flag a symbol of burmas struggle 
against british colonialism on the platform surrounding the base 
of shwedagons central spire 
the agency urged parents to control their children 
in october hundreds rioted when the government took out of 
circulation several currency notes without compensation in recent 
years burma has been plagued by severe inflation widespead 
shortages of goods and even spot food shortages in a country once 
regarded as southeast asias most bountiful rice bowl 
western diplomats and burmese sources say sein lwin played a key 
role in the bloody suppression of student demonstrations in march 
reliable sources say more than 100 people died but the official 
casualties are given as only 43 
on friday the government rounded up the most outspoken critic 
of the system aung gyi and nine others described as his 
associates for attacking the state the group included 
associated press correspondent sein win 
in a letter to sein lwin associated press president and general 
manager louis d boccardi said the ap was deeply concerned over 
sein wins arrest and detention and would appreciate further 
information and clarification of the charges against him 
boccardi asked that an ap representative be allowed to visit 
sein win and expressed hope the family already had that privilege 
boccardi said in the letter dated tuesday that the reported 
charge of attacking the state against the correspondent does 
not comport with our long knowledge of sein win 
the 66yearold former publisher of rangoons englishlanguage 
daily the guardian won an international prize in 1963 for fostering 
freedom of press in his country he was jailed for three years in 
the 1960s for his journalistic activities

the irish republic army today 
stepped up its campaign against british security forces by gunning 
down a parttime soldier as he drove to his civilian job near 
belfast 
the ira claimed responsibility in a statement to the news media 
ira attacks this week alone have killed four people and injured 33 
on tuesday the ira warned civilians to avoid british soldiers 
the primary target of its battle to end british rule in the 
province since november the ira has killed 17 civilians in 
botched attacks 
in todays assault a member of the british armys locally 
recruited ulster defense regiment was gunned down in his car as he 
slowed to cross a narrow bridge outside cookstown 40 miles west of 
belfast police said 
he was driving to work at an engineering plant 
the 31yearold victim who was shot several times in the head 
died later in south tyrone hospital said a spokesman for the royal 
ulster constabulary the provinces police force the spokesman 
demanded anonymity 
news reports said the guerrillas drove to the ambush point in a 
car stolen from a family of five people who were held hostage 
overnight 
on tuesday an ira bomb exploded under a car in a busy shopping 
area in lisburn near belfast killing a policeman and injuring 18 
bystanders 
about 20 minutes later a parttime soldier was killed in front 
of his wife and 2yearold daughter after two ira gunmen dragged 
him from a belfast store during a family shopping trip 
earlier tuesday six parttime soldiers in the mainly protestant 
ulster defense regiment were hurt when an ira land mine blew up 
their land rover in the county tyrone village of carland 
tuesdays attacks came a day after an ira explosion tore through 
a british army postal sorting center in north london killing one 
soldier and injuring nine 
the mainly roman catholic ira which claimed responsibility for 
the attacks is fighting to unite this predominantly protestant 
province with the irish republic under socialist rule 
brian feeny a belfast council member from the moderate catholic 
social democratic and labor party called tuesdays attacks an 
attempt by the ira to put right its cockups by the tried and 
tested method of killing offduty policemen and ulster defense 
regiment men who are easy targets 
the ira issued its warning on civilians tuesday through the 
irish republican publicity bureau in dublin ireland 
we are issuing this warning because the close presence of 
civilians often forces us to abandon operations it said no 
one should travel close to or with clearly identified members of 
the british forces 
the statement said the warning applied throughout europe 
british news reports quoted unidentified irish nationalist 
sources in belfast as saying the warning particularly applies to 
civilians who frequent discotheques and pubs used by offduty 
military personnel 
that aroused fears the guerrillas may be planning attacks 
similar to two 1974 pub bombings in and around at london and a 1982 
pub bombing near londonderry northern irelands secondlargest 
city 
the three bombings killed 15 soldiers and nine civilians and 
injured about 150 people the ira claimed responsibility for the 
1974 bombings the irish national liberation army a marxist 
offshoot of the ira said it staged the 1982 attack 
mondays blast was the first fatal attack in mainland britain 
since ira guerrillas blew up prime minister margaret thatchers 
hotel during a political convention in october 1984 she narrowly 
escaped injury but five people were killed 
it was the fifth ira attack since may on british military 
targets outside northern ireland three british servicemen have 
been killed and 12 other people injured in four machine gun and 
bombing attacks in west germany and the netherlands 
on march 6 british commandos shot and killed three unarmed ira 
guerrillas in gibraltar 
the 17 accidental civilian deaths forced the ira to issue a 
series of embarrassing apologies to relatives of the victims two 
of whom were from an ira stronghold in west belfast

the us air force base near the greek capital when a defense 
agreement between greece and the united states expires at the end 
of the year

that one of the decisions reached by the greek government is the 
abolition of ellinikon air base

the united states operates in greece it is 10 miles from athens

on tuesday a ranking government official said the ellinikon 
base would either be closed or stay as it is ruling out its 
transfer or merger with another american base on the southern greek 
island of crete he spoke on condition of anonymity

monitor soviet fleet movements in the mediterranean sea 
negotiations for a new defense and cooperation agreement to 
replace the existing accord are scheduled to resume sept9 the 
current treaty expires dec 31

their bases when it expires

been differences of opinion during the negotiations he said greece 
wants to safeguard its paramount national interests this

cuba today rejected as preposterous and 
unrealistic a south african proposal for ending the 13yearold 
angolan war that envisaged a ceasefire in a week and the 
withdrawal of foreign troops in 10 months 
cuba faulted the plan for linking a ceasefire in angola with 
independence for neighboring southwest africa also known as 
namibia south africa rules the territory in defiance of several 
un resolutions 
angola also criticized the proposal 
cuba said the plan forwarded by south africa on tuesday was an 
outdated attempt to revive the linkage between the independence 
of southwest africa and the cuban presence in angola 
the preposterous and unrealistic proposal of setting 
compulsory dates for the withdrawal of cuban troops from the 
territory of angola is not in keeping with the actions that have 
recently taken place on the terrain it said 
that was a reference to the reported standoff in fighting that 
pits cuban and angolan forces against anticommunist rebels and 
south african troops 
however the statement said cuba and angola will continue talks 
with south africa on a peace settlement the latest round of which 
began in geneva on tuesday 
an angolan statement said the proposals did not reflect the 
spirit of prior agreements and vowed that angola will not 
negotiate away its sovereignty and independence 
the statement read in portuguese by deputy foreign minister 
venancio de moura and translated into english by an interpreter 
said the south african announcement violated the principle of 
confidentiality and could disturb the climate of the 
negotiations confidentiality it said had been agreed on 
previously by all sides 
the south african proposal unveiled by foreign minister pik 
botha in pretoria broke a news embargo requested by assistant 
secretary of state chester crocker who is chairing the 
negotiations 
the cuban statement said bothas public announcement of the 
proposals violates the principles that have governed the previous 
rounds of always preserving the complex details of this 
negotiation process 
but it said that angola and cuba will maintain a serious 
and responsible conduct of the talks the joint cubanangolan 
delegation will not be the one to cause their disruption 
south africas proposal marked the first time it has offered a 
specific date for granting independence to southwest africa and 
was seen as a major development in efforts to resolve the war in 
angola 
it calls for an aug 10 ceasefire in angola botha said that if 
the truce is accepted south africa would withdraw its estimated 
3000 troops from southern angola by sept 1 
on nov 1 south africa would begin withdrawing from namibia 
under a un resolution that calls for the territorys independence 
botha said elections would be held in namibia on june 1 
provided cuba has withdrawn its estimated 50000 troops from angola 
by the same date 
cuban troops are in angola supporting the countrys marxist 
government south africa and the united states support the rebels 
of the national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita 
the south african proposal calls for the ceasefire to be 
monitored by committees established at the current geneva talks 
botha did not specify who would do the monitoring in the past he 
has proposed a un presence 
botha said if a ceasefire begins aug 10 it would give un 
officials almost three months to prepare for south africas 
withdrawal from namibia 
cuba and angola have suggested a fouryear timetable for the 
cuban withdrawal south africa and the united states are seeking a 
much shorter time period 
south africas mandate over namibia was terminated by the united 
nations in 1966 but it has retained control of the country which 
possesses considerable mineral wealth 
among other issues addressed by the south african proposal are 
the southwest africa peoples organization whose guerrillas 
have been fighting for independence for 22 years south africa says 
they must stop raids into southwest africa from their bases in 
southern angola 
african national congress bases in angola which south africa 
wants closed the pretoria government says the group has seven 
major bases in angola 
financial assistance for namibia south africa spends billions 
of dollars annually on southwest africa it is looking for someone 
else to help the territory pay its bills and has suggested the five 
permanent members of the un security council 
the plan does not mention unita the groups leader jonas 
savimbi wants a powersharing accord with the angolan government 
but the countrys marxist leaders have so far refused to negotiate 
with the guerrilla movement 
the geneva talks scheduled through thursday are the fifth 
round of negotiations that began in may 
participants agreed last month on a basic set of 14 principles 
that would lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from angola 
and the granting of independence to namibia no timetable was 
agreed upon

a federal judge suggested gov mario cuomo 
remove members of yonkers city council for voting down a 
courtordered housing desegregation plan and a state board today 
considered whether to take over the citys finances 
us district judge leonard sand found the city and three 
council members in contempt tuesday and slapped the city with a 
100 fine that will double daily the citys 337 million budget 
would be wiped out by the 22nd day 
a meeting of the yonkers financial control board was called for 
this afternoon to prepare for another session on thursday the 
board appointed by cuomo to oversee spending when yonkers faced 
bankruptcy four years ago can take over the power to disburse 
funds 
we want yonkers to work itself out of its problems said 
bill brown spokesman for secretary of state gail shaffer who 
heads the board wed rather that there be no control board at 
all but obviously this the court decision changes things 
immensely 
sand on tuesday noted that the governor has the power to remove 
elected officials for misconduct and malfeasance 
when a city of almost 200000 totters on the brink of 
bankruptcy makes itself a symbol of defiance to a federal court 
and acts in a manner so devastatingly adverse to the interest of 
its citizens it is the states responsibility to intervene the 
judge said 
tom conroy a spokesman for the governor said that cuomos 
office was monitoring the situation earlier cuomo had refused a 
request from city officials to intervene on the citys behalf 
saying such action would be inappropriate 
brown said shaffer has been in constant touch with cuomo 
aides about the situation 
the desegregation plan was defeated 43 three council members 
who voted against the plan were fined 500 a day the fourth had 
his contempt proceeding delayed because he had no lawyer 
council members who refuse to endorse the plan face jail aug 11 
unless they change their stand 
sands action comes after two years of repeated threats against 
the states fourthlargest city for its failure to build lowincome 
and affordable housing in 1985 the judge found the city liable 
for intentionally segregating housing and schools over a 40year 
period 
the precipitating action came monday night when the city council 
refused to endorse a package of bonuses financial incentives and 
zoning variances to attract developers to build 800 units of 
affordable housing throughout the city 
the vote came after sand warned the council that failure to pass 
the resolution would result in fines and possible imprisonment 
only those council members voting against the resolution were 
subject to contempt 
the fines against the city will be deposited into the us 
treasury rather than in a separate account meaning the fines will 
be nonrefundable sand said

a teenage girl who accused a school 
administrator of sexual misconduct days before he committed suicide 
did not recant as her mother had claimed police said 
douglas tarrant was arrested on a charge of lewd and lascivious 
behavior four days before he killed himself july 15 in the garage 
of his clearwater home he left a videotape saying he was innocent 
of the charge 
the girls mother said that the 15yearold told police and 
school officials her daughter had changed her story but that no one 
told tarrant however a state attorneys report released monday by 
the police disputed that police spokesman william doniel said 
newspaper stories gave the impression to the public that why 
didnt the detective contact the guy and tell him it wasnt true 
the state attorneys report was a way to make people aware 
that she did not recant her story doniel said 
the report called the girl a credible witness who was 
straightforward in her responses had an accurate memory and has no 
conflict of interest in the outcome of this case 
the report also said tarrant had a history of soliciting 
teenage girls for sexual acts 
tarrant was arrested after the girl called police and reported 
that tarrant asked her to get into his car she said she could see 
the man masturbating 
family members said that tarrant probably took his own life 
because of depression over severe health problems but that the 
arrest added more stress on the pinellas county school systems 
assistant superintendent for finance 
the mother denied the contention in the report that she 
pressured the girl to recant 
i did not pressure that child into changing her story the 
woman told the st petersburg times the police frightened her 
theyre embarrassed because so many people were notified the girl 
changed her story and they never told the man

a guard who passed around nude pictures of 
an inmates wife and made disparaging remarks about her body 
engaged in conduct that was tasteless but not unconstitutional a 
federal appeals court ruled 
we discern no aggravated abuse of authority invasion of 
carefully guarded personal modesty or calculated and 
egregious humiliation that would amount to a violation of the 
right of privacy the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
tuesday 
the court upheld a lower courts dismissal of a civil rights 
suit by inmate ezra davis and his wife mary against correctional 
officer theodore bucher 
the four pictures were found in an envelope in an inventory of 
davis possessions in 1983 during a prison transfer in washington 
state bucher showed the photos to at least two other prisoners 
the court said 
in 1984 in a conversation with a desk sergeant bucher 
described the photo incident adding gratuitous derogatory 
comments about mary davis anatomy that were overheard by at 
least one other guard and an inmate the court said 
buchers conduct was tasteless unwise and unwarranted but 
was not the type of governmental abuse which demands a 
constitutional response the appeals court said 
the court also noted that davis had brought the pictures into 
prison where privacy protections are generally recognized to be 
reduced

a brief moment of change in a burma a 
country beset by a quarter century of authoritarian rule appears 
to have shattered with the emergence of a leader even more 
hardline than his predecessor analysts say 
western diplomats academics and burmese emigres fear that the 
already troubled southeast asian nation could more face civil 
disorder in reaction to retired army general sein lwins taking the 
reins of power from ne win 
the burmese government today imposed martial law on the capital 
rangoon diplomats said the order came after thousands of masked 
students marched through downtown shouting slogans denouncing sein 
lwin 
a few days after sein lwin emerged as burmas president and 
ruling party chairman authorities arrested burmas most respected 
dissident aung gyi and other potential leaders around whom 
mounting opposition could have rallied 
leaflets have been circulating in rangoon calling for sein 
lwins overthrow 
almost daily peaceful demonstrations are being held by students 
and some monks at the shwedagon pagoda burmas holiest shrine and 
a traditional center for political protest 
today saffronrobed buddhist monks and large numbers of workers 
joined students in the downtown demonstration said western 
diplomats in rangoon 
virtually the only optimistic note sounded by analysts is that 
the new leaders will attempt some economic reforms while trying to 
keep a lid on dissent that has boiled over into bloody street riots 
three times since october 
the shortlived expectations of change were sparked july 23 when 
ne win who had wielded power since seizing it in a coup 26 years 
ago resigned as chairman of the burma socialist program party 
he also called for a referendum that could have replaced 
oneparty rule with a multiparty system a special party congress 
subsequently was held and proposals for major economic reforms were 
debated 
but just three days later and for reasons still unclear the 
77yearold chairman was replaced by sein lwin who is widely held 
responsible for ruthlessly suppressing student demonstrations in 
march 
the referendum was also turned down 
only the economic reform package remained but some analysts 
express skepticism about how far and how effectively it can be 
implemented 
i dont see any prospect for progress but rather for 
resistance violence says robert nathan a washingtonbased 
economist who follows burmese developments 
in a place where there hadnt been any hope for change 
expectations were suddenly raised now thats been dashed down 
the drain 
whatever the changes at the top the country is still run 
daytoday by several hundred active duty or retired military 
officers a group that over the past quarter century has turned 
perhaps southeast asias potentially richest nation into one with a 
per capita income of less than 200 
with little economic expertise at senior echelons there is 
skepticism whether the wideranging and complex economic reforms 
proposed can be pushed through even if genuine political will 
exists 
the economic package includes allowing private foreign 
investment for the first time since 1962 and sweeping privatization 
of sectors previously controlled by the state 
the slumping economy appears to have been a key fuel to tensions 
and disillusionment widely expressed by people in rangoon and 
elsewhere 
but some analysts also see recent changes as having heightened 
the potential for internal discord 
john badgely a burma expert at cornell university said in an 
interview that a past pattern is being duplicated ne win perhaps 
allowing a potential rival to rise only so high before cutting him 
off 
the american professor said ne win has opted for support from 
more reformminded military officers and those who have benefited 
from the limited economic reforms he instituted last year while 
sein lwin represents the conservative old guard 
badgely foresees a possible confrontation between the two men if 
sein lwin strikes out too far on his own 
others however believe an ailing and old ne win has simply 
lost control of the situation and sein lwin has staged a kind of 
coup against his former commander 
still others note that close bonds between the two go back to 
the early 1940s when the poorly educated sein lwin joined ne wins 
outfit the fourth burma rifles as a private 
sein lwin served ne win as a personal aide and later as a 
commander when an iron fist was required in 1962 the year ne win 
seized power sein lwin headed troops that put down a campus riot 
in a hail of bullets 
these analysts view recent events as a wellorchestrated plot by 
the two in which the secretive ne win will now play a 
behindthescenes role

detroit voters dealt mayor coleman young a losing hand by 
rejecting his dream of casino gambling while missourians bailed 
out their struggling lottery by raising the jackpot limit 
in other results of primaries in three states tuesday missouri 
democrats gave state rep betty hearnes who once lived in the 
governors mansion as first lady a shot at returning there as 
chief executive they also endorsed rep richard gephardts 
lastminute bid for a seventh term and sent farm activist wayne 
cryts into a rematch with republican rep bill emerson 
michigan republicans choosing between two millionaire 
excongressmen picked jim dunn to challenge liberal democratic 
sen donald riegle 
kansas had one congressional incumbent facing a challenge gop 
rep jan meyers who tallied 85 percent of the 3rd district vote 
against charles b bat masterson a retired school adminstrator 
the detroit vote marked the third time in 12 years that young 
who is expected to seek reelection next year has seen his plan to 
boost the local economy by building hotelcasinos set back at the 
polls 
with all precincts reporting the ordinance outlawing casinos 
was approved 82271 to 50890 or 62 percent to 38 percent 
according to unofficial returns 
this is sending a message to the administration that we are 
the ones in charge here not he said the rev keith butler of 
the alliance against casino gambling 
but frank stella a member of the mayoral study commission that 
recommended casinos blamed the defeat on poor organization and 
said casino gaming is going to come to detroit sooner or later 
the measure puts an ordinance on the books that would ban 
casinos from detroit even should the legislature someday legalize 
gambling in the state however it is not clear whether that 
ordinance could withstand a court challenge as an unconstitutional 
attempt by a city to supersede state law 
supporters of the missouri amendment called it crucial to the 
future of the 2yearold lottery which had been suffering because 
of competition from surrounding states 
previously exactly 45 percent of sales money had to go to 
prizes 45 percent to the state and 10 percent to administrative 
costs now a minimum of 45 percent must go for prizes and 
officials say they want give away about 50 percent and also spend 
more on advertising 
with 96 percent of precincts reporting 455068 voters or 57 
percent had voted in favor and 337182 or 43 percent voted 
against the amendment 
mrs hearnes 61 whose husband warren was governor from 
196573 will attempt to become missouris first woman governor by 
unseating republican gov john ashcroft who did not face a primary 
youll see it start to heat up between now and november 
mrs hearnes said in claiming victory now when ashcroft flies 
around the state he cant get away with saying hes not 
campaigning 
with 97 percent of precincts reporting mrs hearnes had 368390 
votes or 81 percent and lavoy zaki reed a st louisarea 
teacher had 84123 votes or 19 percent 
gephardt who abandoned his bid for the presidential nomination 
just in time to file for reelection piled up 82 percent of the 
vote against three littleknown democrats he will face thor 
hearne a former education department official who won the gop 
primary 
cryts who became a folk hero in 1981 when he took his familys 
soybeans from a padlocked bankrupt grain elevator also swamped 
three opponents and said he would waste no time opening his 
campaign against emerson who narrowly beat him in 1986 
were going to be starting out early in the morning shaking 
hands we are taking nothing for granted cryts said the 
votes are here but we have to motivate the people

nuevo diario said there were moments of terror the sandinista 
national liberation fronts paper barricada said quoting the

soldiers were aboard

in january they seized several towns and villages along the 
managuarama road to stop the supply flow but later retreated 
tuesdays attack violates a fragile ceasefire the two sides 
agreed to march 23 negotiations have since failed to forge a 
lasting peace in the 7yearold war and reagan is seeking to renew 
military aid to the contras which congress cut off in february 
meanwhile the sandinista newspaper barricada said shultz 
meeting in guatemala monday with the foreign ministers of costa 
rica guatemala el salvador and honduras marked a new level of 
north american pressure and blackmail aimed at blocking the central 
american peace process 
the united states sought but failed to obtain from the four 
nations a statement denouncing nicaragua on the grounds it has 
failed to comply with a peace plan the five central american 
presidents signed one year ago

do as we say not as we do the united states government 
seems to be saying to the rest of the world 
at a time when it is struggling to persuade third world 
governments to honor their commitments by paying off their enormous 
debts the american government is playing the role of deadbeat in 
the most prominent international forum the united nations 
at this point the government owes the united nations 4674 
million in dues

us officials fear there wont be enough money to keep the

brattleboro vt reformer on foreign aid 
a sign of how dramatically americas financial status has 
changed during the reagan administration could be found in a recent 
new york times dispatch that pointed out that the 10 largest banks 
in the world now are all japanese 
the biggest us bank citibank is not even in the top 20 
almost as stunning was the report in the boston globe 
that japan this year is providing 10 billion in relief supplies 
technical assistance and development grants to third world 
countries in asia africa and latin america 
washingtons aid totals just 92 billion and is stagnant 
for a long time the united states has not been a particulary 
generous contributor of foreign aid measured on a per capita basis 
but at least the countrys overall aid allotment exceeded that of 
other countries 
now japan with a population half the size of the united 
states has surpassed this country

anonymously save for the small scraps of paper or signature

the westerly ri sun on using unapproved drugs for aids 
food and drug administration commissioner frank e young took an 
important step in deciding to let people import small quantities of 
unapproved drugs for treatment of aids or other intractable 
conditions 
it is an act of compassionate good sense 
allowing such departures from normal fda practices might be 
thought to undermine sound procedural rules this need not be the 
case if reasonable precautions against abuse are taken 
the drugs to be allowed past customs for personal use may or may 
not be effective

savannah ga evening press on edwin meese 
recognizing that our readers may be getting tired of editorials 
about attorney general edwin meese we promise to keep this one as 
short as possible 
sen carl levin dmich has asked the office of government 
ethics to launch a new inquiry into meeses conduct since another 
new probe was initiated by the justice departments ethics unit not 
many days ago levins proposal seems unnecessary and a political 
ploy 
one can hardly blame the democrats for trying to make hay off 
meeses problems but they face the danger of overkill lets have 
one investigation at a time 
meese for his part continues to make amazing defenses of his 
conduct now he has charged that he never would have been 
investigated by a special counsel if his two top aides had not 
bungled a preliminary inquiry 
doesnt he realize that acceptance of his charge would require 
the conclusion that he chose inept and incompetent deputies

the alabama journal montgomery ala on aid to the contras 
maybe its a genuine awakening of understanding maybe its 
concern about a party ticket led by someone with no foreign policy 
experience 
whatever the case democrats in the senate are now talking 
sensibly about restoring military aid to the contras in nicaragua 
if the sandinista regime continues to violate the peace pledges it 
has made 
that the sandinistas havent done what theyd said theyd do 
should surprise no one 
this is a dedicated marxist outfit indebted philosophically 
economically and militarily to moscow and havana and its leaders 
cannot be trusted 
the resistance of the contras is all that prevents the total 
domination of nicaragua by the sandinistas that resistance is 
enfeebled by the cutoff of american aid 
now some sentate democrats say they favor releasing that 
withheld aid for the contras if the peace plan is not honored well 
they should 
the sandinistas obviously intended to honor the agreement only 
as long as it suited their purposes and only to the degree that it 
was convenient the military aid which has been waiting in 
warehouses should be released now

albuquerque nm journal on president aquino and ferdinand 
marcos 
philippine president corazon aquino faces a tough decision 
should she welcome former president marcos home no questions 
asked no criminal charges leveled in exchange for an infusion of 
5 billion 
marcos also pledges an infusion of good will his support for 
the aquino government would heal the rift between his compatriots 
and the new regime ushering in an era of national reconciliation 
according to marcos spokesman 
surely to deny his request would prolong the enmity between 
marcos partisans and aquino supporters 
those appear to be powerful incentives but one has to wonder if 
the expresident could support mrs aquino actually swinging his 
still substantial political following behind a leader they perceive 
as a usurper or does support translate to not actively 
oppose 
what cannot survive if this deal is cut is the electorates 
faith in the integrity of government any sense that government 
officials are there to serve instead of loot

bentsen dtexas use millions in privately raised funds to win 
reelection to the senate while he runs for vice president on a 
ticket that like the gop side gets 46 million in federal funding 
and can spend no more than that 
because items such as ads on texas television will help bentsen 
in both campaigns at once the gop complains that the 10 million 
or so that the senator may spend on his reelection will give the

fourday anachronistic meeting where no business is transacted or 
very little 
there is even talk in some quarters of abolishing conventions 
now that the television networks have reduced their coverage to a 
few hours a night that would be a mistake 
rather than complain about conventions the networks ought to do 
some selfexamination 
fortunately the networks no longer have a monopoly and

richard j phelan as independent counsel for an ethics committees 
probe into the actions of house speaker jim wright dtexas was a 
wise and necessary step in keeping the publics confidence that the 
investigation will be fair and complete 
but the panel should rescind immediately an unnecessary 
restriction it imposed by limiting his inquiry to a twomonthold 
list of six charges without allowing him to follow further 
allegations unless he gets special permission 
the committee has also retained control over public release of 
phelans findings another unnecessary and potentially harmful 
decision 
theres no reason that phelan cant conduct an honest

bills 
we dont like the way congress is going about its efforts to 
provide drought relief 
the drought of course was unexpected so the drought relief 
has to come from money not provided for in the federal budget 
but recent budget figures indicate theres only 59 billion 
standing between the 1988 budget and the 146 billion deficit that 
will trigger the acrosstheboard budget cuts everyone hates 
so what are our droughthating lawmakers doing these hot days in 
dc farm state lawmakers are pushing for a quick compromise on 
the 44 billion house version and the senate drought aid package 
with a price tag ranging from 59 billion to 66 billion 
why the rush because other things like nutrition aid programs 
and the war on drugs are threatening to take a slice of the 59 
billion 
if lawmakers could bring themselves to stay within 146 billion 
of a blackink budget they wouldnt face this dilemma or have to 
make such unseemly haste on this important program

that a jury would find him guilty 
it was unfair to meese it was also unfair to the people of the 
united states 
but mckay never tested in court his conclusion that jurors would 
find the attorney general guilty as charged 
mckay decided not to prosecute on the ground that he lacked 
evidence that meese did what he did for personal gain but meese 
realized personal gain from what he did 
meese says mckays report vindicates him thats foolish what 
mckays report does is cover meese with mud 
the only way meese can get all the mud off now is to demand that 
the justice department finish mckays job and prosecute then a 
jury can vindicate meese or it can do what mckay said it would 
either way the unfairness that stains the meese report will be

cypriot president george vassiliou criticized 
the united states today for past inaction in seeking reunification 
of his divided island but said american interest in persuading 
turkey to withdraw its troops was picking up 
some 30000 troops and 50000 turkish settlers occupy the 
northern part of cyprus vassiliou will meet in new york on aug 24 
with turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash under un auspices the 
cypriot president has proposed a federalized republic and the 
islands demilitarization 
in the 14 years since the turkish invasion vassiliou said the 
united states has been unwilling to exert its influence to 
moderate turkey while promoting withdrawal of foreign troops in 
other countries 
will foreign troops be withdrawn from everywhere but cyprus 
he asked 
in effect he said the united states had taken a position in 
favor of turkey and one that was inconsistent with american policy 
elsewhere but he said he found the reagan administration ready to 
play a more active role 
at the same time vassiliou said the majority greek cypriots 
would have to make concessions to the turkish cypriots such as 
accepting a turkish province alongside the greek cypriot entity 
both under a federal government 
we have to recognize despite what we may have liked as greeks 
in the past that there is only one way to get this feeling of 
security for everybody concerned to establish a real federation 
he said 
the two provinces would retain their governments whatever 
shifts in population there might be while police forces and courts 
would be local to establish a feeling of trust he said 
vassiliou rejected a suggestion that cypriots develop their own 
nationalism 
the only way forward is for the greek cyrpiots to be proud 
that theyre greeks and for the turkish cypriots to be proud that 
theyre turks and at the same time for both of them to recognize 
that they were born on cyprus and that they should get 
together on that island he said 
i dont think we can develop a kind of third type of cyprus 
nation there is no such thing as a cypriot nation vassiliou 
said there are cypriot greeks and cypriot turks and the 
recognition is very important because if you start saying i want 
a cypriot nation you will create a feeling of anxiety 
especially among the turks because they are in the minority 
vassiliou who is on a 10day visit to the united states met on 
monday with president reagan and vice president george bush he is 
meeting in boston later today with gov michael dukakis the

senate democrats crept toward agreement today 
on a compromise aid package for the nicaraguan contra rebels which 
they hoped would cool the issues status as a political hot potato 
there is a framework coming together i think well be able to 
agree on senate majority leader robert byrd dwva told 
reporters after a meeting of nearly a dozen democratic senators 
late tuesday 
but byrd declined to offer details of the plan and cautioned 
that the situation still is fluid 
meetings continued today and participants reported slow 
progress byrd planned to add the aid package to a pentagon money 
bill if agreement could be reached on its details and said he 
still hoped to attract republican support 
meanwhile president reagan renewed his support for major 
assistance for the contras today i call upon congress to keep 
faith with itself he told a white house meeting of news media 
exeuctives 
even as the democrats met behind closed doors on tuesday senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan was making pointed political 
references to the issue and seeking to highlight disagreements 
between the two democratic standardbearers massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis who opposes aid and his vicepresidential running 
mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas who has supported it 
sen john kerry dmass one of those participating in the 
democratic drafting sessions said the package would offer 
continued humanitarian aid to the antisandinista rebels and 
provide for the release of some 16 million to 18 million in 
already purchased weapons if certain conditions were met and 
congress gave its consent in a later vote it would provide no new 
money for lethal aid he said 
conditions for triggering the later vote would include continued 
flows of soviet weaponry into nicaragua violations of last years 
regional peace accord by the leftist sandinista government and any 
attempt by he managua regime to militarily mop up the rebel 
forces kerry said 
the contras have received no new military support since early 
this year when congress rejected lethal aid and a ceasefire 
between the two sides took effect 
but some 16 million to 18 million in weapons bought with 
previously authorized money remain stockpiled in contra warehouses 
and available for use if congress gives the goahead and more 
importantly provides for a delivery mechanism like the cia 
the true nature and intention of the sandinistas are exposed 
when are people in congress who have been lied to for nine years 
going to get angry about it reagan said 
he said after nine years of lies broken promises and 
noncompliance the sandinista mortgage is due 
sandinista subversion in central america poses a risk all the 
way up to the rio grande reagan said 
in response to a question reagan said he supports a 47 million 
package of military supplies and humanitarian aid to help the 
contras he also said congress should start by freeing the already 
purchased weapons now stored in warehouses 
it is a political issue dole told reporters in one of 
several appearances tuesday that appeared designed to turn up the 
political heat there is a schism between the two candidates 
dukakis strongly opposes military support to the rebels fighting 
the managua government while bentsen consistently has voted for 
it senator bentsen was right governor dukakis is wrong dole 
added 
dole has proposed his own aid package which includes 27 
million in new humanitarian aid for the rebels and 20 million in 
new military supplies the lethal portion of the aid would be 
released only if congress voted to do so at some later date dole 
vowed to attach his version to the first legislative vehicle which 
comes before the senate 
if they want to starve the contras then thats up to the 
majority democrats and their nominee for president dole added 
denying that his partisan attacks were part of any campaign to get 
himself named to the gop vicepresidential slot 
the issue is a delicate one for both parties democrats dont 
want to be accused of starving the rebels out and giving a free 
hand to the marxist sandinista government republicans dont want 
to be accused of derailing the nowfaltering regional peace process 
bentsen meanwhile called for an aid package that includes 
standby military supplies for the contras he seemed to describe in 
broad terms a package like the one being worked on by his fellow 
democrats 
we ought to fence what military aid has already been sent down 
there and that aid be held there and that the sandinistas 
understand its there and can be used and given to the contras if 
they try to wipe out the contras bentsen said 
he said he would support contra aid when it comes to the floor 
later this week despite dukakis views on the subject i have 
been voting my conscience in the senate for 18 years and i am 
going to continue to do that and dukakis accepts that

the tape was reportedly made during a 1983 strike by railroad 
workers that did not involve police according to dan brucker a 
spokesman for the metronorth commuter railroad 
i am morally outraged by their actions i am insulted and i am 
embarrassed metronorth president peter stangl said in a 
statement he called the officers conduct unprofessional and 
unacceptable 
he said that the officers depicted on the tape have been 
suspended without pay and that the railroad will seek to have them 
fired and stripped of their commissions to prevent them from

volcanic eruptions may contribute to depletion 
of the earths ozone layer by belching an average of up to 14 
million tons a year of ozonedestroying gases into the 
stratosphere a report says 
but volcanoes pose far less threat to ozone than manmade 
chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons do said researcher william 
rose 
the ozone layer in the stratosphere blocks ultraviolet radiation 
from the sun that can cause skin cancer destruction of ozone by 
chlorofluorocarbons has caused worldwide concern leading to a 
treaty signed recently by two dozen countries to curtail emissions 
the new study is presented in thursdays issue of the british 
journal nature by rose and robert symonds of michigan technological 
university in houghton with mark reed at the university of oregon 
in eugene 
they estimated concentrations of various gases from past 
volcanic eruptions and used the results to project annual worldwide 
totals 
on average volcanoes release a total of up to 154 million tons 
of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride to the atmosphere a 
year but less than a tenth reaches the stratosphere they 
calculated 
gases from cataclysmic volcanic eruptions can rise more than 15 
miles high so they should encounter the maximum concentration of 
ozone at about 15 miles they wrote but more work is needed to 
tell just what such eruptions actually do to the ozone they said

and deportation cases are pending in the courts a us justice 
department official said 
neal sher head of the departments office of special 
investigations said the growing number of proceedings against 
suspected war criminals was the result of an aggressive policy to

i dont wait for someone to present me with an allegation we 
seek out people sher told the associated press before a 
conference wednesday on nazi war criminals 
sher said the justice department had computerized lists of nazi

men who have genital sores or are uncircumcised 
have a much greater risk of catching aids during sexual intercourse 
with infected women a study concludes 
the research conducted in kenya suggests that the prevalence 
of some sexually transmitted diseases the common use of 
prostitutes and the lower frequency of circumcision may help 
explain why aids has spread widely through heterosexual contact in 
parts of central africa 
while aids is transmitted mostly through homosexual encounters 
and illicit drug use in the united states and europe experts 
believe it is largely a heterosexual disease in africa where up to 
a quarter of sexually active adults in some cities are infected 
the study was conducted with men who caught sexually transmtted 
diseases from prostitutes in a nairobi neighborhood where more than 
85 percent of the street prostitutes were infected with hiv the 
aids virus 
clearly prostitute contact genital ulcer disease and an 
intact foreskin are all risk factors for hiv infection said dr 
j neil simonsen who directed the study 
uncircumcised men were nearly three times more likely than 
circumcised men to be infected with hiv those with a history of 
genital ulcers or sores were seven times more likely to have the 
virus 
being circumcised seems to help protect people somewhat from 
catching some venereal diseases however the researchers found 
that uncircumcised men were still more likely than circumcised men 
to catch hiv even if they had never had a sexual disease 
the research has been presented in part at several scientific 
meetings and was published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
in the study the researchers found a strong link between aids 
risk and a sexually transmitted ailment called chancroid this 
bacterial disease is common in africa but relatively rare in the 
united states however simonsen said that two common american 
diseases genital herpes and syphilis also probably increase the 
chance of aids 
the report said that controlling diseases that cause genital 
sores could be an important means of stopping the spread of aids 
the researchers speculate that the sores might raise aids 
susceptibility by causing breaks in the skin where the virus can 
enter people with genital sores may also be more likely to pass on 
the aids virus if they are already infected with it 
the researchers are unsure how being uncircumcised might 
increased the risk of aids infection however simonsen said its 
possible that the presence of a foreskin offers a nice moist 
microenvironment for the aids virus to survive longer and have a 
greater chance of penetration through little nicks in the skin that 
are a normal part of sexual intercourse 
even though the report found an association between circumcision 
and aids risk it does not prove that circumcision actually helps 
protect people from infection 
based on this data its not possible to recommend that 
everybody run out and get circumcised simonsen said the 
association is strong and probably will be causal but you cant 
conclude that 
the researchers said 85 percent of white american men are 
circumcised circumcision practices vary in africa in the kenyan 
study threequarters of the men were circumcised 
simonsen a physician at case western reserve university in 
cleveland ohio conducted the work with researchers from the 
university of nairobi the kenya medical research institute the 
nairobi special treatment clinic the university of manitoba and 
the institute of tropical medicine in belgium 
in an accompanying editorial dr jonathan m mann of the world 
health organization estimated that there have been 250000 cases of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome worldwide so far and 5 million 
to 10 million people are probably infected with the aids virus 
he said other factors that may contribute to aids in africa are 
blood transfusions the use of unclean needles and infection of 
babies by their mothers during birth

a group of 143 men including 
doctors lawyers and a commissioned army captain said wednesday 
they wont perform the military service required of all white males 
in south africa 
at news conferences in johannesburg cape town durban and 
grahamstown the men cited religious moral and political reasons 
for their refusal to serve in the south african defense force most 
of the men could face up to six years in prison if convicted of 
avoiding military service 
the army is not defending south africa as a whole but is 
defending the system of apartheid said etienne marais who was 
in the army from 19802 
thousands of black south africans have been detained 
tortured or died in what can only be called a civil war said 
marais 26 a psychology student at the university of the 
witwatersrand in johannesburg 
all white men in south africa are required to perform two years 
of initial service and after that they are subject to annual 
callup camps that can last as long as three months 
more than 100 of the 143 men have not served any time in the 
military the rest including marais have served some of their 
required service but vowed not do any more 
several have served in angola where south africa is fighting 
alongside rebels battling that countrys marxist government 
the men who said they were not part of any organized movement 
included doctors lawyers engineers a nuclear physicist and army 
capt andre zaaiman who renounced his commission and said he would 
not serve in the callup camps if ordered to do so 
im not prepared to fight or die for apartheid said 
zaaiman 28 a teaching assistant at the university of cape town 
i reconfirm my refusal to participate in any way in the sadf 
until the system of apartheid has been done away with completely 
and until the sadf acts in the interest of all south africans he 
said 
the south african government no longer releases information on 
how many men refuse orders to serve in 1985 the last year 
government announced the figures 7589 men chose not to serve 
the end conscription campaign which opposes mandatory military 
service has said the numbers are increasing due to the armys 
involvement in angola and in patrolling black townships in south 
africa 
the army sometimes arranges nonmilitary government service for 
men who refuse to serve for religious reasons however the 
military refuses to provide alternative service for men objecting 
to service on moral or political grounds 
the group of military objectors called for nonmilitary 
nongovernment alternative service for men who did not want to 
serve in the sadf 
as loyal south africans we wish to contribute to the building 
of a peaceful nonracial and just society the group said in a 
statement we do not see serving in the sadf as a way of 
contributing to peace in our country 
last week military objector david bruce a 25yearold 
university student was sentenced to six years following a highly 
publicized trial 
in march dr ivan toms who ran a health clinic in the black 
squatter camp of crossroads outside cape town was sentenced to 21 
months in prison for refusing to serve in a onemonth callup camp 
military service by nonwhites in south africa is voluntary

reconnect the bones stitched together seven severed blood vessels 
reattached five tendons and some nerves and finally sewed the outer 
skin closed 
the fingers are healing very well and circulation is 
excellent said surgeon martin adson so these fingers that are 
so important in picking up things almost certainly will survive 
now he added 
he said only time will tell how much stiffness will remain in 
general children do better than adults so we are hoping a newborn 
will do even better he said 
mrs meckle said she harbors no ill feelings over what happened 
during the delivery calling it just an unfortunate accident 
she declined to name the doctor involved but said id go back to 
him anytime

the copilot at the controls of a continental jet 
that crashed nov 15 killing 28 people was fired by another 
airline in 1985 for failing flight tests a national transportation 
safety board report shows 
lee bruecher 26 was fired from able aviation in houston 
texas as a result of his failure to successfully complete the 
flight examination after at least two attempts said the report 
obtained by the rocky mountain news 
the continental dc9 crashed in a snowstorm at stapleton 
international airport with 82 people aboard bruecher and pilot 
frank zvonek 43 were among the victims 
the ntsb has not yet determined what caused the crash although 
pilot error wing icing wing design air traffic control and 
possible turbulence are among the factors the agency said it was 
examining 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said a final report on the cause 
is expected to be released at an ntsb meeting sept 13 
bruce hicks continental spokesman said tuesday that 
continental did not learn about bruechers dismissal during its 
background check of bruecher 
but he added the issue of able aviation four or five years 
ago and lee bruecher flying for continental is irrelevant he was a 
wellexperienced pilot 
the ntsb report said gary guillet ables chief flight 
instructor reported that bruecher had a chronic problem of 
stepping on the wrong rudder becoming disoriented and described 
bruecher as tense and unable to cope with deviations from the 
routine

1987 and was trained until sept 14 he had completed about 25 
flights with continental with 36 hours flying time at the time 
of the nov 15 crash officials said

energy secretary john herrington today 
recommended that two new nuclear reactors producing the raw 
materials for nuclear weapons be built in south carolina and idaho 
herrington told a news conference that a stateoftheart 
heavywater reactor will be built at does savannah river complex 
near aiken sc capable of producing all the tritium needed to 
meet demand 
a second smaller reactor that could be expanded if tests are 
successful would be built at the idaho national e scbo oo 
the two reactors will cost an e p68 billion and will 
take approximedely 10 years to complete 
with this approach we have increased assurance that we can 
have the reactor capacity we need on schedule and that no single 
external event or generic technical issue can cause a total 
shutdown of our tritium production capacity herrington said 
earlier today sen james mcclure ridaho had said he was 
confident that the planned gascooled test reactor at idaho falls 
eventually would be expanded into a fullscale production reactor 
but sen strom thurmond rsc and some other senators said the 
money to finance such an expansion might not be available 
the savannah river reactor will be the no 1 priority said 
sen sam nunn dga who had helped south carolina lawmakers lobby 
for the project 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee said the 
idaho reactor would be a backup system and that congress will 
have to look very closely before deciding whether to expand 
that reactor 
thurmond said savannah river was the most logical choice for 
a new production reactor because of its existing infrastructure 
its wealth of trained and dedicated personnel and the unwavering 
support it enjoys on the federal state and local levels 
sen ernest f hollings dsc said savannah was simply the 
best site because it has the needed support facilities the 
proven technology and experienced firstrate personnel 
that reactor will cost an estimated 2 billion to 4 billion to 
build 
an energy department advisory board concluded last month that 
construction of a new heavywater reactor at savannah river 
provided the pbest chance of ensuring an adequate and 
uninterruped of triium a key ingredient in nuclear 
weapons 
the department has four aging production reactors three at 
savannah river and one at the hanford reservation in washington 
state 
the three savannah river reactors are shut down for various 
reasons but had previously been operating at less than 50 percent 
of full power because of safety concerns 
the reactor at the hanford reservation in washington state was 
placed on cold standby earlier this year 
joseph salgado an acting deputy secretary of energy told a 
senate appropriations subcommittee last week that construction of a 
new reactor was essential for national security reasons 
future requirements cannot be met reliably with existing 
facilities salgado said 
about 5 percent of the nations stockpile of tritium is lost 
each year through natural radioactive decay salgado said 
without a continued supply of new tritium the effectiveness 
of our overall nuclear deterrent capability deteriorates rapidly 
said salgado

vietnam said wednesday it has stopped 
helping the search for missing american servicemen and resettling 
former political prisoners because of the hostile us policy 
toward the hanoi government 
the action abruptly stalled recent agreements on the divisive 
issues and a period of general improvement in vietnameseus 
relations 
the voice of vietnam radio said vietnams foreign minister and 
deputy prime minister nguyen co thach wrote a letter sunday to 
retired gen john w vessey president reagans special envoy on 
humanitarian issues in vietnam 
a text of the letter was carried by the official vietnam news 
agency which was monitored in bangkok 
thach noted the recent agreements and said regrettably the 
us side has not responded to the vietnamese sides proposals for 
the materialization of these 
more regrettable still thach said was assistant secretary 
of state gaston sigurs july 28 testimony before a congressional 
committee 
sigur argued against establishing interest sections in hanoi 
and washington saying that would not improve cooperation on 
humanitarian issues and instead urged continued us isolation of 
vietnam until it ends it decadeold military occupation of cambodia 
obviously that statement shows that the us state department 
is continuing its hostile policy toward vietnam thach wrote 
we have shown our seriousness and good will in solving the us 
humanitarian issues but in response the us has made hostile 
statements 
in face of that situation i regret to inform you that the 
vietnamese side is forced to temporarily suspend the uss 
participation in the joint search for and excavation of americans 
missing in action as well as the resettlement in the united states 
of the released reeducation camp people 
sigur who is in charge of asian affairs testified before a 
house foreign affairs subcommittee in response to a pending 
congressional resolution that urges establishment of interest 
sections or lowlevel diplomatic missions diplomats say vietnam 
is desperate to break out of its international isolation and bring 
in muchneeded economic aid 
under the thachvessey agreement of a year ago vietnam pledged 
to accelerate its accounting of nearly 1800 americans listing as 
missing in action in the vietnam war the united states pledged to 
help vietnam with its humanitarian problems 
in letters to vessey last month thach pledged to try to resolve 
by the end of the year 70 mia cases considered top priority by the 
united states and welcomed joint excavations for remains from 
august to october there have been no such excavations since the 
first one in late 1985 
technical experts of the two sides met in hanoi last week to 
work out arrangements david lambertson assistant secretary of 
state for east asian and pacific affairs said later we 
anticipate that joint activities could begin quite soon we 
anticipate a substantially higher level of activity over the next 
three months 
wednesdays broadcast did not say if vietnam had also halted 
unilateral efforts it has returned large numbers of suspected mia 
remains since the vessey agreement 
in july the two countries held talks in hanoi on americas 
offer to resettle former us government employees and officials of 
the usbacked south vietnam government who were put into 
reeducation camps after the 1975 north vietnamese victory 
a joint communique said vietnam was allowing them to emigrate as 
the united states gave assurances it would not encourage them to 
conduct antivietnamese activities it said they hoped that 
processing could begin in a few months 
that was a minor breakthrough since there was virtually no 
movement after the united states offered in 1984 to resettle the 
former internees 
the vietnam news agency on monday blamed the us for lack of 
progress saying the biggest obstacle was the us sides refusal 
to set up a working group to organize the emigration to the united 
states of about 500000 people including relatives of the released 
inmates and to oversee execution of this commitment

rural families who have been blessed with a 
daughter but really wanted a son will be allowed to try again under 
a new government policy that bows to the myths and economic 
realities that have long made peasants prefer male children 
the exception to chinas onefamily onechild policy was 
announced wednesday by a family planning official they want boys 
and they are not abiding by the original policy so we changed it 
he said of the peasants 
the new policy which will not apply to city dwellers was 
criticized by a united nations official who said the government 
should encourage rural families to regard the two sexes equally 
rather than bend to their prejudices 
li yong a spokesman for the state birth control commission 
described the new rule in an interview with the associated press 
his remarks were the first official confirmation of the new policy 
which amounts to a relaxation of chinas rules which prohibit 
families from having more than one child 
the first word of the new policy appeared tuesday in the 
peoples daily which reported it had been instituted in shandong 
province 
li said the state will now give peasants in almost every 
province the freedom to have a second child if their first was a 
girl about 80 percent of chinas 107 billion people are peasants 
li said families would only be permitted to have one extra 
child after that they will be subject to the same fines as 
everybody else he said 
fines for having too many children generally amount to 270 or 
more per year for five years about twice the average rural income 
the head of beijings office of the united nations fund for 
population activities said the change was unusual because china 
recently took steps to enforce the one child policy this change 
certainly is not in line with the modern feeling that children of 
both sexes are equal said manfred kulessa 
refusal on the part of the peasants to bow to the onechild 
limit prompted the government to loosen its regulations li said 
the peasants belief that boys were economically more productive 
than girls and chinese superstitions favoring male children were 
main reasons they fought the policy he said 
li said the change would not greatly affect chinas population 
because only 19 percent of its families have one child nor would 
it affect the ratio of men to women he said 
our real problems are with the families that have three five 
and even seven children he said we need to concentrate on 
those now li said no relaxation was planned for the stringent 
onechild policy in the cities 
superstition has made it difficult for government officials to 
convince peasants that daughters were as good as sons li said 
citing a popular chinese proverb more sons more happiness 
this has become especially true in a dragon year he said 
chinese mythology says it is good to have children especially 
boys in a dragon year 
recent economic reforms have also created a desire for sons he 
said 
during the last decade peasants have returned to farming their 
own plots of land because the plots are too small for 
mechanization peasants need more hands to do the work girls 
cannot do physical labor as well as boys naturally a boy is more 
desirable he said 
in addition most peasants are not covered by any sort of a 
pension so they want to have sons to support them when the get 
old when a girl gets married she leaves home he said boys 
stay on and support the old folks 
li acknowledged that an increasing number of girls have been 
abandoned by parents who want sons 
after years of pushing big families china began attempts to 
limit its population with the onset of westernoriented economic 
reforms in 1978 
but the going has been rough apart from the economic reforms 
which encourage big families in the countryside a generation born 
during a baby boom in the 1960s has reached childbearing age 
as a result china is in the middle of another baby boom that 
has seen the population growth rate jump from 11 percent in 1985 
to 14 percent in 1987 if the growth rate continues china 
population could swell to 15 billion by 2010 
china attacked this problem in february when it announced 
stringent measures to control growth linking the salaries of local 
family planning officials to the population growth rate of their 
area

here is the text of president reagans 
announcement wednesday that he had vetoed the defense authorization 
bill and the questionandanswer session that followed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i have just now vetoed the defense authorization bill in the 
oval office i think my reasons for this action can be plainly 
stated if not seen 
the bill would signal a basic change in the direction of our 
national defense a change away from strength and proven success 
and back toward weakness and accommodation of the 1970s this 
decade opened with a weakened national defense totalitarian 
expansionism and growing regional conflicts all of these trends 
as we move toward the close of the eighties are being reversed 
i just returned from moscow after signing the first nuclear arms 
treaty in history that reduces nuclear missiles theres a soviet 
pullout under way in afghanistan we see progress in settling 
regional conflicts such as cambodia and angola and even in the 
iraniraq war because of our military presence and strong stand in 
the persian gulf there is hope of a settlement were also 
cautiously hopeful about democratic reform within the eastern bloc 
itself 
american prestige and power have been restored weve dampened 
aggression and promoted peace and weve come to an even greater 
realization of how much our renewed military strength has meant to 
all of us 
but over time the defense bill that ive just vetoed would 
have placed in jeopardy all of these diplomatic and strategic 
advances it would endanger progress in arms negotiations by giving 
away our negotiating leverage without getting a single thing in 
return from the soviets and this i shall not do 
second the bill would gravely endanger the sdi program no 
development has been more crucial to the progress in arms reduction 
negotiations than our decision five years ago to proceed with the 
strategic defense initiative the importance placed on this system 
by the soviets is evidenced not only by the 20yearlong 
development of their own sdi but by their actions at the 1986 
summit 
the american people understand the simple truth the elementary 
logic of having in place a defensive system that can protect this 
nation from nuclear missile attack and may some day free the world 
of the nightmare of nuclear terror and the american people have 
repeatedly expressed their agreement with this position 
however the way this bill restricts our proposed spacebased 
interceptors would cripple the very concept of a space shield 
against nuclear attack and i will not abide this particularly in 
view of the technical progress that sdi is making they say this 
bill would take the stars out of star wars 
with my veto today im putting back the i initiative 
in sdi so the nearly 20 percent cut in sdi funding combined 
with the congressional restriction on the spacebased component of 
the program amounts to this gutting sdi 
as i say i will not abide it i do not believe the american 
people will either and again i want to emphasize that this bill 
would mean unilateral concessions to the soviets concessions that 
would reduce my bargaining leverage at the conference table at the 
very moment when that leverage has produced its most fruitful 
results 
it cuts by 25 percent our strategic modernization funding 
request at the very moment when were negotiating a strategic arms 
reduction treaty it represents congressional micromanagement not 
only of key strategic defense programs but of delicate arms 
negotiations it would set a dangerous precedent of tying 
presidential hands in arms negotiations 
i have been patient as the liberals in congress attempted to 
erode our military strength a strength that has provided the basis 
for our diplomatic success and i can be patient no longer 
congress needs to get back to work and come up with a bill i can 
sign these are issues of national security and they must remain 
above partisan politics

yes andrea 
question mr president what about the fact that the democrats 
have in this bill more money than you in fact asked for so how do 
you respond to those who say that this is a political gambit on 
your part that this is partisan politics for george bush against 
mike dukakis and that youre vetoing a bill that would actually 
spend more on defense than you had even asked congress for 
reagan well the partisan politics is on the other side and the 
fact that the total of the bill is within the budget requirements 
it is the fact that inside they have taken upon themselves to 
change where the spending is going to take place and remove it from 
some things and add it to others 
q whats partisan about that thats what congress and the 
executive do all the time 
a i dont think i think there has to come a time when you 
depend on the experts and the people and the military experts and 
all and your own knowledge of what and where the money is most 
needed in the military and not on what theyve been doing for 
example not because we know that there is a partisan position in 
which there are a great many there who just dont want sdi at all 
well i think theyre bucking the tide because weve proven 
that sdi is can be practical and can be a method of protecting us 
against a nuclear attack and i think the overwhelming majority of 
the american people want that kind of protection 
q mr president given the lateness in the both the 
congressional season and the political season do you not now risk 
getting no bill at all or a continuing resolution that would give 
you even less of what you seek in terms of defense in other words 
how much of this is going to result in an actual change as far as 
the budget is concerned and how much sets the stage for a 
political debate later in the campaign 
a well i think we have to recognize that the senate had a good 
bill on this and one that would have been appropriate and in 
conference they gave up too many things and i just think that they 
have to recognize that weve got to come together and recognize 
each others views on what is necessary and what is essential

q well do you expect another bill before congress goes out 
a well the appropriations bill as it stands is one that i 
could sign and would sign 
q mr president are you ready to retract statements that you 
made when we downed the iranian airliner it seems that the report 
will show apparently according to reports today that the crew 
panicked that actually you know this sort of thing could 
probably happen again 
a well helen ive read and seen and heard what is being said 
about the report and assigning the blame to the people in the 
radar room who were interpreting the radar signals and all but i 
cant comment because actually neither the military nor my office 
have received the report as yet and as soon as we receive it and 
can go over it and study it ourselves then well be able to 
comment but 
q no preliminary indications 
a no and i dont think that the we could consider the report 
final until it has been submitted now and how it has escaped 
before this took place i have to feel the process has not been 
concluded 
q mr president who are you going to choose to replace jim 
baker as secretary of the treasury 
a you know something you caught me here i cant remember just 
exactly some of the things all that were considering and 
whether we were ready to make an announcement on that situation as 
yet 
q yeah go ahead 
q go ahead 
a no no one announcement a day is enough 
q mr president you have said that this bill is a product of 
partisan politics and you accuse the liberals of playing politics 
with it yet your own secretary of defense mr carlucci urged you 
to sign the bill senator warner from virginia the leading 
republican on armed services urged him to sign the bill how can 
you say its a product of partisan politics and liberal politics if 
your own advisers told you to sign the bill 
q well i know that i think that the secretary will abide by 
the decision that i have made he had some questions and he had 
some concerns of what might result from vetoing and i have to say 
that the preponderance however of belief and that from our own 
people in the legislature was that the faults and flaws outweighed 
any of the concerns that were expressed by a few others 
q but does this mean that mr carlucci is soft on defense and 
for a weak defense 
a oh no 
q as youve accused the sponsors of the bill of doing 
a no not at all no not at all hes doing a fine job and as 
i say i think youll find that he is supportive of the action 
weve taken 
q mr president 
marlin fitzwater frank lets take lets take a final 
question here frank go ahead 
q he called on me marlin marlin he called on me 
reagan i had just 
fitzwater all right go ahead 
reagan all right 
q mr president what has been vice president bushs role in 
the two decisions yesterdays decision not to veto the 
plantclosing bill and todays decision to veto the defense 
authorization measure 
a i think youd find that we were in complete agreement in both 
of these instances 
q did he advise you 
a what 
q to take both of these courses 
a well i know whether he agrees or disagrees on things and he 
has been very careful of whether he seems to be overstepping or not 
in his present position but hes been a part not only of these 
but hes been a part of every other major undertaking of our 
administration 
q but you cant tell us what his advice was 
q mr president on the subject on the subject of vice 
president bush if i may 
fitzwater lets take one final question frank 
reagan he all right is that the one were taking 
fitzwater thats the one 
reagan all right you see how well we get along here 
q on the subject of vice president bush both your 
plantclosing yesterday and todays dod authorization veto hinged 
not only on advice and counsel from the vice president but also on 
what you and your advisers felt would help him politically but 
im interested in what your explanation is for his great deficit in 
the polls you have gone out of your way to say that hes been an 
active vice president but apparently the american people dont buy 
that or if they do they dont like what they see 
a well you all are aware of the power of the media and the 
power of the press maybe it has to do something with the fact that 
for quite some considerable time now ever since the decision was 
recognized as final on the democratic side their candidate has 
been getting several times as much space and time in the press and 
the media than the vice president has now maybe when our 
convention takes place and theres going to be some coverage of 
that maybe well see a change coming 
q mr president 
a i would think that a change would begin to come when the 
campaign really gets under way and we reveal how many falsehoods 
have been spread among the people by the opposition 
q on the coverage 
q mr president 
fitzwater thank you 
q mr president if thats all there is give us a chance 
fitzwater thank you mr president 
q do you feel that michael dukakis 
q come on 
q should make his medical records public he has refused to 
make his medical records public the first official for high 
office since eagleton in 1972 he has had is campaign 
representatives call up unsolicited phone calls to newspapers 
saying he never had psychiatric care he walked away from a 
question about that last friday do you think that the american 
people deserve to know whether hes fit to govern by having his 
medical records made public 
a look im not going to pick on an invalid 
q mr president why shouldnt we 
q an invalid in what sense sir 
q why shouldnt we have 
a i think that he has told you that that was the last question 
q what do you base that remark on 
q invalid in what sense though 
q you know more about what public opinion wants in the way of 
defense than the congress which spent six months 
q get that down 
q making compromises and taking testimony from military and 
other experts why do you think you know more dont you think the 
public opinion in this country may have changed from wanting all 
our money for the defense department to making some of that money 
be more balanced and go for other programs 
a i say i cant take any further questions and youre 
absolutely right i did stay 
q you cant take any more questions why cant you 
a down in front maybe ill start taking some further back 
q thats a good question 
q mr president why shouldnt we unfreeze those assets if it 
would mean getting the hostages out 
q why are we being standing so tough on iran 
a because were trying to bring peace in the 
middle east 
q why cant you take my question 
q in what way is mr dukakis an invalid 
a i cant 
q you answered hers why cant you answer mine 
q what did you mean by invalid 
a its over i got to go to work

the temperatures are in the 90s the humidity is 
brutal and the beaches are closed all in all lester rawitz 
figures a pretty good new york summer 
this is the biggest year i ever recall were completely 
cleaned out said rawitz a manhattan air conditioner retailer 
for the past 34 years speaking from his airconditioned office 
theres no question its been good 
good for rawitz good and hot for almost everybody else on 13 
occasions last month the mercury climbed above 90 degrees in an 
average new york july the temperature breaks 90 just seven times 
the forecast for the current week calls for temperatures to crack 
100 
if we didnt get two weeks with a tremendous amount of rain 
it would have been extremely warm last month said national 
weather service meteorologist joe harrison pausing for a moment 
not that it wasnt warm enough 
how hot was it 
hot enough to make the asphalt mushy making city streets like 
flypaper hot enough to make people look forward to riding the 
subway where at least theres air conditioning hot enough to be 
the ninth hottest july since the weather service began keeping 
track in the 1860s 
the temperaturehumidity index is considered uncomfortable for 
everyone when it reaches 79 on monday and tuesday it broke 80 
ive used my air conditioner more in the last month than i 
have in my whole life said martha lipfert a public relations 
worker for consolidated edison im sure im not the only one 
either 
worst of all there has been no relief at the beaches 
as temperatures climbed so did the number of beaches closed by 
waves of medical waste and other garbage other beaches were closed 
when sewage escaped from a staten island treatment plant 
the heat and humidity have been stifling i cant remember a 
summer like this in the 12 years ive been here said joseph 
lecinski supervisor of jones beach state park despite that 
lecinski says crowds are off about 50 percent on the beaches 
at jones beach there were 865000 visitors in july 1988 the 
year before there were 175 million at robert moses state park 
attendance was down to 366000 from 650000 it was the same story 
at the gateway national recreation beaches riis park down to 
515000 from 1079740 and great kills 10071 from 23450 
there were no attendance figures at city fire hydrants which 
desperate city dwellers opened for relief but the city received 
6431 calls reporting such beach parties 
people are sweltering in their apartments because they cant 
go to the beach said andrew mccarthy of the department of 
environmental conservation which oversees the hydrants 
that hasnt kept baseball fans at home at shea stadium the new 
york mets have drawn crowds of more then 45000 for each of the 
last five days including sellouts for four games against the 
secondplace pittsburgh pirates this past weekend 
the heat may be keeping people away from other city attractions 
about 6000 fewer tourists went to the statue of liberty last 
month compared to july 1987 
in midtown manhattan the citys ban on street vendors made it 
difficult for sweatsoaked pedestrians to grab a dove bar or find 
the good humor man 
as a result many new yorkers turned to the great indoors for 
relief a tour of midtown taverns on tuesday showed a heavy turnout 
of visitors escaping the heat and enjoying a cold brew or two 
its been packed in here all day said bartender john 
mcdermott of mcanns between trips to the beer taps tuesday 
afternoon from what i hear tomorrows going to be worse 
the temperature climbed into the 90s again on wednesday which 
meant another day off for the horses which pull carriages in 
central park it was another day for tourists to sit in the spray 
of a fountain outside the exxon building and for lester rawitz to 
smile inside the offices of economy national sales inc 
i just got a call from a woman in washington wants us to send 
an air conditioner to her mother up here rawitz said the last 
six weeks just constant demand

a settlement reached in a sex discrimination lawsuit against the 
health club 
men must give 24 hours notice before using the spa until 
membership is at least 10 percent male attorney gloria allred said 
tuesday 
i think it should be made clear to everyone and every business

brought the lawsuit 
the spa agreed to give flacco 38 a free oneyear membership 
and pay 15000 in attorneys fees as part of a settlement said 
ms allred who represented flacco

south african proposals for ending the angolan war 
were rejected wednesday by angola and cuba but the negotiators and 
a us mediator agreed to continue talks aimed at reaching a 
peaceful settlement 
two us officials suggested that south africa broke 
confidentiality rules set for the secret talks by providing details 
to the media 
the negotiations now in their fifth round and scheduled to end 
thursday have come closer to reaching agreement than any in the 
past 
the proposals disclosed by foreign minister pik botha in 
pretoria called for a ceasefire in angolas 13yearold to begin 
wednesday set timetables for foreign troop withdrawals and called 
for free elections in southwest africa commonly known as namibia 
on june 1 1989 
cuba dismissed the timetable proposals as preposterous and 
unrealistic and said they constituted an outdated attempt to 
revive the linkage between the independence of namibia and the 
cuban presence in angola 
the angolan delegation in a less vociferous statement said the 
proposals did not reflect the spirit of prior agreements and 
vowed the marxist government will not negotiate away angolas 
sovereignty and independence 
bothas move evidently caught the chief us mediator assistant 
secretary of state chester crocker by surprise and angered him 
were going to stick to the table and encourage others to do 
the same he told newsmen upon arrival for a new closeddoor 
meeting 
later a us spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that in keeping with the ground rules of the negotiations 
the us delegation will state its views at the conference table 
and not in the media 
many proposals have already been tabled in these negotiations 
there will be more if we are to achieve a settlement there must be 
real give and take leading to compromises acceptable to all 
parties he added 
the public controversy contrasted with the upbeat assessments on 
july 20 when the three nations said in new york they had accepted 
an unprecedented joint document listing 14 principles as a 
basis for a peace settlement 
botha said that if the ceasefire were accepted south africa 
would withdraw its estimated 3000 troops from southern angola by 
sept 10 
the south africans support the antimarxist unita rebels of 
jonas savimbi who also receive us arms aid 
south africa also proposed to start nov 1 the withdrawal of its 
troops from namibia over which it has retained control in defiance 
of several un security council resolutions 
but it also demanded that the 50000 cuban troops that have been 
helping the luanda government fight unita since 1975 leave angola 
by june 1 the date when south africa proposed free elections in 
namibia 
south africa also called for the dismantling in seven guerrilla 
camps which it said were operated in angola by the african national 
congress the main black group fighting white rule in south africa 
the delicately balanced set of principles agreed on at new york 
last month did not mention the ancs role neither did it contain 
any reference to unita or to swapo the southwest africa peoples 
organization swapo has been waging an armed struggle since 1966 to 
end south africas hold on namibia and also is reported to have 
bases in angola 
the principles would commit the signatories of a peace 
settlement not to allow acts of aggression or violence against 
other states

president reagan took a swipe at democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis today calling him an invalid he said later 
i was trying to be funny and it didnt work 
dukakis in boston reacted in lowkey fashion saying of 
reagan no apology was really needed we all occasionally 
misspeak and i dont think the president needed to apologize 
im a very healthy guy he said 
republican vice president george bush meanwhile touring a 
defense plant in annapolis md said when asked about reagans 
remark before i make any comment on what anyone else said i 
want to talk to the president about it im not going to be 
drawn into this minicontroversy 
while dukakis held his fire his running mate sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas said reagans remarks were outrageous and 
laughable at the same time 
reagan was responding to a question from a reporter representing 
executive intelligence review a publication associated with 
political extremist lyndon larouche the questioner said dukakis 
had declined to disclose his medical records particularly whether 
he ever has undergone psychiatric treatment 
a dukakis spokesman responding to such questions last week 
said dukakis had never been treated for any mental condition 
neither dukakis nor bush has released full medical records during 
the 1988 campaign though bush said today he would release his 
records as he did in 1980 
dukakis asked today if he had ever suffered from depression 
said no asked if he had ever consulted a psychiatrist he 
said no 
asked if would release his records he said ill be happy to 
provide the people of this country with a full report on my 
physical and mental condition from my physician of 17 years 
he previously released a report from that doctor gerald r 
plotkin saying he was in good shape and had suffered no major 
medical problems during the period before 1971 his only physician 
was his father 
reagan smiling told reporters when asked about dukakis 
records im not going to pick on an invalid 
he wouldnt elaborate on what he meant however a few minutes 
later at a separate appearance reagan brought up the subject 
again telling reporters he thought his choice of words had been 
unfortunate 
a short time ago i attempted a joke i was kidding reagan 
said asked if he based his comments on any information he had he 
added i was just trying to be funny and it didnt work 
he did say he believes the american people are entitled to know 
about a candidates medical history 
talk of treatment of dukakis first circulated at the democratic 
national convention in atlanta two weeks ago after handbills were 
slipped under reporters hotel room doors they were signed 
national democratic policy committee a political arm of 
larouche 
asked about the subject last friday dukakis campaign press 
secretary dayton duncan said he hasnt been treated for any 
mental illness or mental depression of any kind asked if that 
precluded any form of psychological therapy or counseling duncan 
said yes 
dukakis in boston to carry out state business was focusing on 
education and the war on drugs meeting with outofstate school 
commissioners and naming a new director of his model governors 
alliance against drugs 
dukakis the son of highly successful greek immigrants also was 
receiving president george vassilious of cyprus late this 
afternoon the visit comes two days after the cypriot chief of 
state met with president reagan to discuss the 14year conflict 
between the islands turks and majority greeks 
but despite dukakis facility with languages and inspiring story 
as the son of immigrants who achieved the american dream it was 
bush who most recently made an overture to hyphenated americans 
describing himself as a nice wasp or white anglosaxon 
protestant bush told a group of followers from ethnic backgrounds 
he can speak spanish but i can speak our language of ethnic 
values and pride everlasting pride in the united states of 
america 
in his remarks to the bush 88 coalition of american 
nationalities bush focused on the intense patriotism and support 
of such conservative social issues like voluntary school prayer and 
the death penalty as popular among recently new americans 
but if bush was claiming the ethnic constituency dukakis was 
claiming anew that the reagan era is over at least in congress 
dukakis says congress forced reagan to allow plantclosing 
legislation to become law and he said the action proved that 
democrats were controlling the nations agenda he said that 
victory and progress on a related trade measure catastrophic 
illness legislation and raising the minimum wage has a great deal 
to do with the attitude of the american people that they want 
something different 
even though ronald reagan still occupies the white house we 
can safely say michael dukakis has just signed into law his first 
bill as president added rep tony coelho dcalif the house 
majority whip saying the pendulum has swung away from the 
conservative agenda 
bush said of the measure i think the president made a good 
decision and that matter is now resolved and now we can get the 
focus where it belongs on plant openings 
in chicago bush suggested that development of the 
administrations strategic defense initiative might be critical to 
israels security in a remark directly challenging dukakis he 
said it is one thing to say you are committed to israels 
security but in an age of ballistic missiles if you are against 
defensive systems such as sdi that slogan has little meaning

president reagan today referred to michael 
dukakis as an invalid in a barbed comment on the health of the 
democratic presidential nominee he later said hed been joking 
but i dont think i should have said what i said 
no apology was really needed dukakis said we all 
occasionally misspeak and i dont think the president needed to 
apologize 
im a very healthy guy he declared to reporters in boston 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas called 
reagans remark outrageous and laughable at the same time 
vice president george bush dukakis presidential rival said he 
wanted to talk to reagan before commenting he added im not 
going to be drawn into this minicontroversy 
the president was responding to a reporter representing 
executive intelligence review a publication associated with 
political extremist lyndon larouche the questioner asking whether 
dukakis shouldnt release his medical records said the democratic 
candidate had not done so particularly whether he had ever 
undergone psychiatric treatment 
a dukakis spokesman responding to such questions last week 
said dukakis had never been treated for any mental condition 
neither dukakis nor bush has released full medical records during 
the 1988 campaign though bush said today he would do so 
dukakis when asked today if he had ever suffered from 
depression said no asked if he had ever consulted a 
psychiatrist he said no 
when asked if would release his records he said ill be 
happy to provide the people of this country with a full report on 
my physical and mental condition from my physician of 17 years 
he has already released a report from that doctor gerald r 
plotkin saying he was in good shape and had suffered no major 
medical problems during the period before 1971 his only physician 
was his father 
reagan who was smiling responded to the reporters question 
today im not going to pick on an invalid 
he refused to elaborate on what he meant but a few minutes 
later at a separate appearance reagan without prompting told 
reporters a short time ago i attempted a joke i was kidding 
i was just trying to be funny and it didnt work 
reagan said that he believes the american people are entitled to 
know about a candidates medical history 
rumors that a news organization was about to publish a story on 
the subject of possible treatment of dukakis circulated last week 
as he campaigned through several states 
when asked by reporters at that time campaign press secretary 
dayton duncan denied that dukakis had ever undergone psychiatric 
treatment 
he hasnt been treated for any mental illness or mental 
depression of any kind duncan said 
asked if that meant dukakis had never seen a psychiatrist for 
treatment duncan said yes asked if that also precluded any 
form of psychological therapy or counseling duncan said yes 
talk of such treatment first circulated at the democratic 
national convention in atlanta two weeks ago after handbills were 
slipped under reporters hotel room doors they were signed 
national democratic policy committee a political arm of 
larouche 
in boston dukakis deputy statehouse press secretary stephen 
crawford said we have no comment 
earlier in his news conference reagan sought to shrug off poll 
results that show vice president george bush trailing dukakis 
reagan said that is explained by the news coverage given dukakis 
and last months democratic national convention 
their candidate has been getting several times the space and 
time in the media reagan said

washington if someone formed a rogues gallery of public 
officials they might start with some of the defendants in 
impeachment proceedings they cheated on their taxes they planned 
revolutions they used their positions for personal gain they 
threatened to jail their critics 
impeachment is the process provided by the constitution by which 
congress can remove public officials for misconduct these include 
federal judges who cannot be fired because they have lifetime 
appointments 
the house has adopted impeachment articles for only 15 
officials including us district judge alcee l hastings of 
miami who was impeached on wednesday by a 4133 vote 
impeachment is the equivalent of an indictment and sends the 
case to the senate for trial the house acts by majority vote but 
a twothirds vote is required for conviction by the senate and 
removal from office 
the impeachment process has involved victims of political 
intrigue as well as genuine scoundrels 
the last case ended in october 1986 when the senate ousted us 
district judge harry e claiborne of las vegas in the first 
impeachment trial in 50 years claiborne was serving a prison term 
for tax evasion but had refused to resign and continued to draw 
his salary 
president andrew johnson was impeached by the house in 1868 
after running afoul of radical republicans in congress during the 
troubled period after the civil war he escaped senate conviction 
by one vote 
judge george w english of illinois resigned before his 
scheduled impeachment trial and his case was dismissed the house 
had accused english in 1926 of profanely denouncing state and local 
official in open court and telling jurors they would be jailed if 
a particular defendant was not convicted 
officials can be impeached under the constitution for treason 
bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors 
the first two offenses are easy to recognize but high crimes 
and misdemeanors are more ambiguous although they may not be 
criminal offenses they generally involve conduct that undermines 
the us governments integrity 
twelve of the 15 defendants impeached by the house have been 
judges the others were a us senator a secretary of war and 
johnson 
there have been 12 senate trials two defendants resigned prior 
to senate action and the remaining case is that of hastings 
the first impeachment case was brought against sen william 
blount of tennessee a former commissioner of indian affairs he 
was accused of trying to organize indians and frontiersmen as part 
of a probritish armed attack on spanish territory 
blount was acquitted in 1799 on grounds that a senator is not 
subject to impeachment but by then the senate had already 
expelled blount by a 251 vote 
a fellow tennessean federal judge west h humphreys wasnt so 
lucky with his revolution 
he was convicted by a 380 vote in 1862 because he along 
with other evilminded persons supported his states secession 
from the union 
in 1803 the house charged judge john pickering of new hampshire 
with permitting delivery of a ship to a claimant while us agents 
were trying to condemn the vessel and its cargo for customs 
violations 
but another impeachment charge told the real story it described 
the judge as a man of loose morals and intemperate habits who 
appeared on the bench in a state of intoxication and there 
frequently in a most profane and indecent manner invoked the 
name of the supreme being 
the senate convicted pickering in 1804 after his son testified 
that the judge had been wholly deranged with a disorder that 
has baffled all medical aid 
on the day of pickerings conviction the house voted its only 
impeachment of a supreme court justice samuel chase the senate 
subsequently acquitted chase of charges that he violated a 
defendants rights in a treason trial 
war secretary william w belknaps impeachment in 1876 followed 
congressional investigations of corruption in the grant 
administration 
belknap quit just hours before the house charged him with taking 
bribe money for the appointment of a military post trader but the 
senate proceeded with a trial anyway 
a majority of senators but fewer than the necessary twothirds 
voted for conviction on all four charges however 22 senators 
said they voted for acquittal only because they believed belknaps 
resignation should have ended the case 
others impeached by the house 
judge james h peck of missouri in 1830 on charges stemming 
from his handling of a land claims case he was acquitted by the 
senate 2221 
judge mark delahay in 1873 the house contended his personal 
habits unfitted him for the judicial office that he was 
intoxicated off the bench as well as on the bench he resigned 
after the house vote and the case ended 
judge charles swayne of florida in 1904 charged with 
submitting false expense accounts among other things he was 
acquitted on all counts by the senate 
judge robert archbald of pennsylvania in 1912 he was convicted 
by the senate on five impeachment articles charges included 
obtaining credit from litigants attempting to influence legal 
actions before the interstate commerce commission for a financial 
consideration and using his judgeship to enter into profitable 
business deals 
judge harold louderback of california impeached in 1933 on 
charges he showed favoritism in bankruptcy cases he was acquitted 
by the senate 
judge halsted l ritter of florida impeached in 1936 and 
convicted by the senate the house accused ritter of dramatically 
increasing the fee received by a former law partner whom the judge 
had appointed as a receiver in a bankruptcy case ritter also was 
charged with failing to pay income taxes for two years

blind and visually impaired visitors now can 
rely on an unusual new set of maps to get their bearings around the 
monuments and landmarks of the nations capital 
the tactile maps carrying legends in both english and braille 
were produced under a 150000 federal contract by joseph w 
wiedel a geographercartographer at the university of maryland 
the maps intended for free distribution through congressional 
offices are 14by19inch plastic sheets that depict such 
landmarks as the lincoln memorial the white house and the 
washington monument as bumps shaped like their actual contours 
the maps cover the mall capitol hill arlington cemetery the 
iwo jima memorial and other sights as well as the floor plan of 
the us capitol 
a separate map and smaller pocket guide covers the metro rapid 
transit system different geometric shapes let visionimpaired 
visitors know not only the subway stops but what side of the 
platform the train comes in on 
about 85000 of the contract went to produce six larger display 
modules of the maps which will be placed around washington and 20 
traveling exhibits that will be lent to libraries and other places 
around the country 
george covington a legally blind interior department official 
who directed the tactile capital project said these maps 
are unique there are no others like them in the world right now 
the project was financed by the education departments national 
institute on disability and rehabilitation research 
madeleine will an assistant secretary of education said the 
maps set a standard for other cities and help to make washington 
dc the most accessible capital in the world 
covington said the maps faithful to the actual scale of the 
streets and landmarks of washington and its environs are designed 
more to give blind or visually impaired people their bearings than 
to guide them every foot of the way 
its not intended for a blind person to show up in the middle 
of the mall and instantly know where everything is said 
covington who has only 5 percent vision in one eye but if you 
come out of the longworth building youll know that the capitol is 
in front of you and the rayburn building is off to your left 
the maps muted colors of beige green blue and gray were 
chosen to show up as shades of gray for those who are colorblind 
he said 
the contract covered production of 9200 plastic maps plus 
5000 additional metro maps on paper 
besides copies to be given away by congressional offices senate 
officials have made the maps available for borrowing at all public 
entrances to the capitol and at the guide desk in the rotunda 
covington said the maps can be purchased for 250 to 4 apiece 
from joseph w wiedel room 1167 lefrak hall department of

a judge wednesday suspended a 1 fine 
against a former cancer patient convicted of possessing marijuana 
he says he used to counter the side effects of his treatment 
johnson district judge john a gardner also took under 
advisement a motion to void the conviction of rick morris 31 of 
van lear if morris completes a drug treatment program 
morris was convicted friday of possessing 7 ounces of marijuana 
last november despite his contention that he was forced to smoke 
the drug or die of starvation associated with the effects of 
radiation treatments and chemotherapy 
its kind of weird how important that 1 became to us 
morris lawyer ned pillersdorf said wednesday it was blood 
money 
gardner rejected another defense request to issue an acquittal 
for morris pillersdorf said the lawyer said he argued that the 
prosecutor had not rebutted defense testimony that morris was 
confronted with a choice of evils of either smoking pot or 
death 
a cancerous tumor was discovered wrapped around morris brain 
stem in march 1987 according to testimony in the case 
morris and his mother jo ann morris both testified that his 
weight dropped from nearly 200 pounds before the treatments to 
below 125 pounds when the therapy concluded at the beginning of 
august 1987 
morris remained seriously ill after the treatments and even the 
smell of food brought vomiting pillersdorf said although morris 
tried other drugs aimed at reducing nausea marijuana was by far 
the most effective he said 
the case marked the first time in the nation that a cancer 
patient had used a medical defense in a marijuana possession case 
said bob randall president of the alliance of cannibis 
therapeutics a group pursuing legalization of the substance for 
medical use

lockstep with what coleman young says said barrow who like 
young is black 
barrow challenged the mayors last reelection bid and is

only the camels at the ohio state fair 
one of the largest fairs in north america werent suffering from 
the heat and drought less exotic livestock had to be hosed down 
and the vegetables hardly looked like prizewinners 
this is the worst display i have ever had tony misich of 
clinton near akron in northeast ohio said of his produce ive 
had nothing but trouble this year 
the effects of the nations worst drought in more than 50 years 
were apparent as the ohio state fair prepared to open thursday for 
an 18day run making it the longestrunning fair in the nation 
this year 
it will have 69000 exhibits and the worlds largest midway 
with an estimated 100 rides said spokesman shane jenkins 
the temperature wednesday reaching 89 degrees by noon was a 
steamy reminder of weeks of heat and too little rain and the 
forecast for thursday and possibly beyond was no better 95100 
degrees with high humidity 
fair officials said despite the summers drought they do not 
anticipate any drop in attendance or the number of agricultural 
exhibitors but those displaying their fruits vegetables and 
livestock concede that they are not up to the standards of the past 
misich said his potatoes cucumbers green peppers and onions 
are not only smaller than normal but do not look as good as others 
he has displayed in his 10 years at the fair 
the neighboring display of cabbage potatoes squash pumpkins 
melons and green peppers by grower francis byers looked slightly 
better an observation he welcomed with a grin 
the rain in the last couple of weeks made all the 
difference said byers of greenville about 30 miles northwest of 
dayton but its still not like normal that cabbage is big but 
it gets a lot bigger than that 
across the fairgrounds in the cattle barn 18yearold rob pence 
of piqua north of dayton and his father richard were fighting 
nature and a power outage in their efforts to keep robs beef cows 
spuds and mckenzie cool 
theyre not too bad this year theyre a good size said rob 
pence who raised the pair as a 4h project at least theyve got 
hair 
pence and other 4h members in the barn planned to stay near 
their animals around the clock to make sure they keep cool using 
electric fans hooked up to generators most exhibitors were hosing 
or spraying their cows to beat the heat 
john james of mount gilead who stood watch over the beef cow 
raised by his 18yearold daughter kindra was worried for the 
animal because he said cows do not eat well in intense heat 
if they go off feed you got to work with them a lot more 
he said 
but the three camels in an exoticanimal display seemed 
oblivious to the brutal heat the ships of the desert being 
shown by bob jones attractions basked in the sun and calmly ogled 
passersby 
they like it its just like the desert said one of their 
keepers

government lawyers want to see john hinckleys 
correspondence with convicted mass murderer theodore bundy and 
other materials before the man who shot president reagan is allowed 
to leave a mental hospital on a day trip 
prosecutors said they need to review the materials so they will 
be able to ask pertinent questions about a conclusion by officials 
at st elizabeths hospital here that hinckley would benefit from a 
supervised recreational outing 
hospital officials have suggested that hinckley might benefit 
from a day outing that might include bowling or a picnic us 
district court judge barrington parker has scheduled a hearing on 
the proposal aug 9 
in a court motion filed late tuesday and released wednesday 
prosecutors said they need to see hinckleys letters including 
correspondence with bundy who is awaiting execution in florida to 
crossexamine the hospitals interpretation of relevant facts 
other materials include a letter hinckley received from lynette 
squeaky fromme who was convicted of trying to assassinate 
president ford 
one of hinckleys psychiatrists also indicated hinckley had 
sought the address of charles manson from an unidentified person 
the motion said manson led a california cult that killed several 
people fromme was one of his followers 
revelations about hinckleys correspondence surfaced in april 
1987 when the government successfully opposed a plan by st 
elizabeths to allow hinckley to spend an easter vacation with his 
parents 
at the time parker refused to allow prosecutors to read the 
materials though they were seen by the court and doctors at st 
elizabeths 
in short all parties except the government have had an 
opportunity to examine the materials the motion said 
but prosecutors said they need to look at hinckleys letters 
because they are important and apparently prompted hospital 
officials to cancel the proposed easter event the hospital as

brochures distributed by a concessionaire 
at mesa verde national park were made in japan and a congressman 
wants to know why 
gosh dang i tell you what theres something wrong with that 
isnt there said rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo we have 
real nice printing industries right in the state of colorado 20 
miles from the front gate of mesa verde park 
until recently visitors to the southwestern colorado park 
received a fullcolor brochure listing the hotels restaurants and 
campgrounds run by ara mesa verde co 
what caught visitors eyes were three tiny words on the back 
page printed in japan 
in a letter to national park service director william penn mott 
campbell asked why the agency is sending taxpayers money to 
overseas producers like japan 
karen whitney agency spokeswoman in denver said no tax dollars 
went to japan because the brochure was not an official parks 
publication the agency produces its official brochures and maps in 
harpers ferry wva 
rather ara ordered the brochures through a california printing 
company which in turn subcontracted the job to a japanese firm 
whitney said 
ara executives did not realize the brochures were printed in 
foreign countries until they were delivered she said 
the california printer said he could get the job done at a 
higher quality and a better price in japan than otherwise 
whitney said 
ara has changed its regulations to require that subcontractors 
be american companies and it recently received a new supply of 
brochures printed in farmington nm

the pilot of the iranian airliner shot down by 
a us navy missile over the persian gulf last month had close ties 
to this country and left behind a 5yearold americanborn 
daughter his sisterinlaw told congress on wednesday in urging 
compensation for his death 
i dont know how the family can explain to her that it was an 
american missile that killed her father said nahid sadeghi who 
has lived with her husband in norman okla since 1973 
appealing for us compensation for the families of the 290 
people killed on july 3 when iran air flight 655 was shot down over 
the gulf mrs sadeghi told the house armed services committee she 
rejects irans claim that the aircraft was destroyed deliberately 
she said she also has no belief in rumors the iran air a300 
airbus was flying a suicide mission against the uss vincennes 
let me assure you this story is just as crazy as ayatollah 
khomeinis claim that ronald reagan shot the airbus 
intentionally she said 
she said her brotherinlaw capt mosen rezaian had been a 
pilot for 17 years had been trained by the boeing co in the 
united states and had lived in texas for two years in the 1970s 
he loved and respected the united states and american 
culture she said 
my brotherinlaw was in love with flying with his wife and 
with his children she said he loved life and as a 
professional pilot he understood his responsibility for the lives 
of his passengers he was a good and honest human being 
she said capt rezaian and her sister aryanaz had two daughters 
and a son 
the oldest daughter holds us citizenship because she was born 
while her mother was visiting in norman mrs sadeghi said 
the three children and their mother are now living in west 
germany she said sent there by rezaian because of the war and 
worsening conditions in iran 
i strongly urge you to pay compensation to the families of the 
victims she said they are human beings widows and orphans 
not terrorists who kill and maim 
another witness harold g maier a law professor at vanderbilt 
university in nashville tenn said that while the united states 
has no obligation under international law to pay compensation it 
does have a moral obligation 
he suggested a payment of 75000 for each of the 290 people 
killed for a total compensation of 21175000 
but ralph dupont an attorney representing the families of two 
americans killed by terrorists during the hijacking of a kuwaiti 
aircraft in 1984 urged that no compensation be made to the 
families of those killed on flight 655 until american victims of 
terrorism receive compensation 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services panel 
said president reagans announcement that the united states is 
ready to pay compensation to families of the airbus victims raises 
several questions 
he said these include the question of whether payments should be 
made when irans surrogates still hold hostages and iran has 
never paid any of the victims of its policies 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said that while the united 
states wants to act in a humanitarian manner we also dont want 
to appear naive 
she questioned whether it was possible to assure that us 
compensation be paid only to the genuine heirs of those who died on 
flight 655 and that they not go into the coffers of the iranian 
government 
were going to create a teriffic political backfire in this 
country if the money goes to the wrong people she said

south africas offer to 
withdraw rapidly from southwestern africa offers a potential 
solution to the regions conflicts but reactions wednesday ranged 
from skepticism to outright rejection 
south africa on tuesday proposed an aug 10 ceasefire in the 
angolan war that would lead to a withdrawal of foreign troops from 
angola and independence for southwest africa by june 1 
angola and cuba rejected the offer wednesday but continued 
talks with south african officials and us mediators at peace 
talks in geneva 
the proposal marked the first time south africa has offered a 
specific date for granting independence to southwest africa also 
known as namibia 
however the june 1 target date is less than 10 months away and 
south africa has done little to indicate that it intends to give up 
the territory it has administered for 73 years 
when president pw botha made a rare visit to namibia in april 
he unilaterally strengthened the powers of his appointed 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar 
namibian politicians unanimously condemned the action saying it 
showed south africa wanted to increase its control over the 
territory 
dirk mudge a member of namibias cabinet said wednesday that 
south africans have made so many announcements about the future of 
the territory that one could excuse namibias internal parties if 
they were skeptical 
the leader of the opposition southwest africa national union 
verkuii rukoro called the proposal a public relations exercise 
probably the most spectacular of the decade 
the south african government also may have difficulty selling 
the plan to its own citizens although for different reasons 
the government long has claimed that south africa has important 
security interests in namibia and calls the main guerrilla group 
fighting for independence a terrorist organization 
yet that group the southwest african peoples organization or 
swapo is widely seen as the favorite to win free elections in the 
territory 
many south african whites will probably interpret the namibian 
independence plan as a major concession to militant black groups 
south africas extremeright conservative party called the peace 
plan nothing other than a dishonorable capitulation 
the governments surrender in southwest africa is an 
inexorable step in the direction of black majority rule for south 
africa the conservatives said in a statement 
south africas offer calls for it to withdraw its estimated 
3000 troops from southern angola by sept 1 
south africa and the united states back the unita rebels who 
seek a powersharing accord with angolas marxist government which 
is supported by 50000 cuban troops 
under the south african plan its forces would begin leaving 
namibia on nov 1 and the territory would have independent 
elections june 1 provided cuba has withdrawn from angola 
cuba which has offered to pull out of angola over a fouryear 
period called the offer preposterous and unrealistic 
the five rounds of talks among south africa cuba angola and 
the us mediators have focused almost exclusively on the 
withdrawal of foreign troops from angola and independence for 
namibia 
even if those issues are resovled several potential stumbling 
blocks remain they include 
the future of unita or the national union for the total 
independence of angola the angolan guerrilla movement led by 
jonas savimbi has not been directly involved in any of the 
negotiations and is unlikely to lay down arms unless it receives a 
role in the angolan government angola so far has refused to talk 
to unita 
african national congress bases in angola south africa says 
the anc the main black group fighting to overthrow south africas 
whiteled government has seven major military bases in angola and 
it wants those bases closed down the anc wednesday issued a 
statement from it headquarters in lusaka zambia saying the demand 
was a new roadblock on the path to a peaceful settlement 
financial assistance for namibia south africa currently 
spends millions of dollars annually on namibia south africa is 
looking for someone else to help the territory pay its bills and 
suggested the five permanent members of the united nations security 
council

aid a policeman accidentally shot in the head by his partner 
discovered that the dying man was her brother and that her husband 
had loaned him the gun authorities said 
officer james bloesch 36 died at san francisco general 
hospital on tuesday morning after being shot with the 357caliber 
pistol while examining the gun with his partner 
his sister irene ager and her husband steven were in the 
closest available ambulance when the call came in from the police 
departments stables in golden gate park 
they were not told the name of the victim mrs ager knowing 
her brothers work schedule had an inkling it might be her 
brother but she didnt want to believe that feeling said her 
supervisor paramedic capt ronald louie 
they found bloesch in his dying breath he said wednesday 
they did what they had to do as professionals they performed as 
prescribed until someone could take over no one could have 
expected more 
on realizing that the officer was her brother mrs ager called 
for a replacement crew fearing that she and her husband could not 
handle their duties said city health department spokeswoman 
beverly hayon 
nonetheless the agers helped resuscitation efforts already 
under way one of them inserted a tube to open an air passage into 
bloeschs lungs said louie they then loaded bloesch who did not 
regain consciousness into their ambulance before the backup 
paramedics arrived the second crew drove bloesch to the hospital 
the agers who each have been paramedics for about seven years 
and met on the job were given emergency leaves of absence 
the pistol was registered to steven ager and had been lent to 
bloesch for offduty use bloeschs partner and longtime friend 
james mahoney 40 was examining it because bloesch was having 
problems operating it said police spokesman dave ambrose 
bloesch a mounted officer for seven years had asked mahoney to 
check the silverplated pistol officer stanley buscovich who was 
present near the scene but did not witness the shooting told 
investigators the gun had malfunctioned previously said homicide 
lt jerry mccarthy 
bloesch and mahoney sat on a bench in the small locker room and 
passed the gun between them several times buscovich sat between 
the two facing the opposite direction 
mahoney examined the unloaded gun and handed it to bloesch 
bloesch then loaded it apparently without mahoneys knowledge and 
passed it back 
buscovich said mahoney took a final look and declared its a 
fine gun several moments later the gun fired and a single 
bullet struck bloesch a decorated 16year veteran of the force 
police chief frank jordan termed the shooting an unfortunate 
tragedy and said he was satisfied it was an accident 
officers cried outside the stables and flags were lowered to 
halfstaff at the hall of justice and the stables 
bloesch of san rafael had been awarded a silver medal of valor 
and two bronze medals of valor he is survived by a wife and three 
children

shultz was pressed on wednesday for new ideas about argentinas 
economic problems during the second day of his visit to this south 
american capital 
alvaro alsogaray presidential candidate of the center alliance 
political party said he told shultz that if inflation and 
argentinas foreign debt are not brought under control that 
could affect democracy itself 
in march argentina stopped paying even the interest on its 53 
billion foreign debt the third highest in the developing world 
inflation fueled by government overspending stood at 121 percent 
for the first six months of 1988 
economy minister juan sourrouille planned to unveil an economic 
program later wednesday based on reduced federal subsidies for 
public services voluntary wage and price restraints and a 
devaluation

alfonsin and top aides shultzs plans for wednesday included a 
cookout at a ranch a tour of the historic colon theatre buenos 
aires 80yearold opera house and a private dinner with alfonsin

an environmental investigator completed a swim 
down the hudson river on wednesday and became the first person ever 
known to stroke the 153 miles from albany to the statue of liberty 
in new york harbor 
when it was over skip storch who drank from the river en 
route declared it tasted delicious 
storchs inwater time was 54 hours and 50 minutes over seven 
days said his coach jane katz a physical education professor at 
bronx community college he covered 20 to 25 miles a day and slept 
aboard his pace boat 
storch entered the water at 528 am on july 28 overcoming 
injury and illness he began the final leg of 11 miles at 4 am 
wednesday from just below the george washington bridge and finished 
at 727 am 
i did it basically to let new yorkers know that the waters are 
a lot cleaner than they have been and for everybody not to become 
complacent but keep at it storch 31 of monsey said when he 
met reporters later at the south street seaport in lower manhattan 
he said the hudson was fine north of manhattan but bacterial 
levels in the water adjacent to the city made that part of the 
river unsafe for swimmers 
storch earns his living by testing the waters around new york 
city for the interstate sanitation commission a tristate and 
federal watchdog body 
during his swim he encountered none of the horrors such as 
medical wastes that have closed ocean beaches throughout the 
metropolitan area he said 
i saw a few plastic cups also some logs but thats 
natural he said 
pointing to garbage floating off the seaport in the east river 
he said there was a distinction between unsightly debris and 
healththreatening pollution 
he said isolated instances of barges taking the shortcut and 
just dumping their waste right in the river were deplorable and 
also condemned recreational boaters as probably the least 
courteous to the river and to our waters 
as he spoke to interviewers he ate a plum and later tossed the 
pit into the river 
a stocky 5foot10 he described himself as having only average 
speed for a swimmer but i go and go and go 
he said he swam around manhattan island last summer to get in 
shape for this effort 
storch is prone to ear infection so he carried eardrops with 
him and was ready when it struck around poughkeepsie i also got 
headaches i vomited that sort of thing that always happens he 
said 
in 1937 charles zimmy came within about 10 miles of completing 
an albanytoliberty island swim he made it to 129th street in 
manhattan before being stopped by exhaustion

children as young as 10 are working under 
sweatshop conditions in foreignowned companies in the city of 
shenzhen it was reported wednesday 
the china youth news daily said 44 of 206 foreignowned 
companies or joint ventures in the southeastern city employ 
children under 16 years of age a practice illegal in china 
shenzhen a growing city of half a million near hong kong was 
in 1980 designated one of four special economic zones for foreign 
investment about 80 percent of its foreign capital comes from hong 
kong 
the daily said that among the children working in shenzhen more 
than 1000 were recruited from the nearby rural province of 
guangxi the youngest was aged 10 and the oldest 16 
against a setting of worker strikes sexual promiscuity and 
unwanted pregnancies among about 250000 women who work parttime 
conditions for the children can be incredibly bad the daily 
said 
in one factory producing silk flowers girls as young as 12 work 
14 or 15 hours a day interrupted by a few hours of sleep in a tent 
one 16yearold girl showed a reporter a flowershaped burn mark 
left on her hand by a factory machine she said she didnt earn 
enough money to buy a 6 train ticket home to guangxi 
the report said the children received 22 to 27 a month 
considerably less than adults and that they had to pay for their 
own room and board as well as training fees 
the report did not identify the factory or the foreign investors 
government officials in guangxi charge 20 for false id cards 
for children seeking work in shenzhen who can then claim they are 
of legal age the daily said 
confusion in the management of our labor system provides a 
hotbed for child labor the report said 
it said the manufacturing industry in shenzhen will gradually 
become a world of children 
chinas official press has in recent months focused on the 
growing problems of child labor particularly in the countryside 
where many parents take their children out of school and put them 
to work in small rural factories

nasa technicians wednesday failed to 
find the source of a launch pad hydrogen gas leak but a countdown 
proceeded for the crucial test firing of space shuttle discoverys 
engines on thursday 
they did everything they could do but they couldnt locate 
the leak nasa spokesman george diller said 
we disassembled the hydrogen umbilical but could not pinpoint 
the leak launch director bob sieck said weve changed out the 
seals and debris plate weve done everything we can but its 
still lurking out there 
shuttle managers ordered the countdown to continue toward a 730 
am firing of the spaceships three main engines the test is 
vital to certifying discovery for the first shuttle flight since 
challenger and its crew of seven were lost in an explosion jan 28 
1986 
sieck said if the leak which he described as very small 
develops again during the fueling of discoverys fuel tank late in 
the count the launch team hopes to control it enough with 
pressurization techniques to complete the fueling 
if we get a leak beyond a hazardous level we will 
terminate sieck told a news conference 
engineers believe the leak is temperature related and shows up 
only when liquid hydrogen at 423 degrees below zero is flowing 
through the fuel line into discoverys external fuel tank diller 
said 
the leak is in a launch pad service mast and not on the shuttle 
itself 
it was detected monday during a practice countdown after the 
tank was 67 percent full 
officials said they hoped the leak would not reappear when they 
started pumping 385000 gallons of liquid hydrogen into the tank in 
the final hours of the countdown 
if only a small leak showed up they said they probably could 
continue loading the fuel to eliminate the chance of a fire they 
would neutralize the fuel line with an inert gas nitrogen 
too big a leak would force a fifth postponement of the important 
test firing 
the 20second ignition will be an overall test of shuttle 
systems as the main engines computer software ground support 
equipment communications links and the launch team will get a 
thorough workout modifications have been made to the engines and 
other systems since the challenger accident 
instruments have been placed on joints in the redesigned solid 
fuel booster rockets to measure stresses when the three main 
engines generate total thrust of 11 million pounds 
the booster rockets will not be fired during the test but will 
be subjected to the same bending moments that led to a leak in one 
of the joints during challengers liftoff that leak allowed flame 
to escape and led to the destruction of the shuttle 73 seconds 
after launch 
officials believe the engine test delays combined with an 
unresolved leak in the spaceships steering thruster system could 
slip discoverys launch date from midseptember into october 
nasa has deferred action on the thruster leak until after the 
main engine test when engineers will enter discoverys cargo bay 
and cut a hole through the rear bulkhead in an effort to reach and 
repair the problem

ira gunmen ambushed and killed 
a parttime soldier as he drove to work wednesday claiming their 
fourth victim in three days of attacks on military targets in the 
british province 
thirtythree people have been wounded 
ken maginnes a ranking protestant lawmaker urged britain to 
arrest about 40 people suspected of being irish republican army 
ringleaders and hold them without trial british authorities 
abandoned that policy called internment in 1975 
guerrillas fired on pvt raymond mcnicholl of the ulster defense 
regiment the locally recruited british army unit as he slowed his 
car to cross a narrow bridge outside cookstown 40 miles west of 
belfast 
mcnicholl 31 was on his way to work at an engineering plant 
police said he was hit several times in the head and chest and 
died later at south tyrone hospital 
spokesmen for the royal ulster constabulary the police force of 
the protestantdominated province said the guerrillas drove to the 
ambush in a car stolen from a family of five held captive overnight 
an ira statement to belfast news media claimed responsibility 
for the killing on tuesday the ira warned civilians to stay away 
from british servicemen because they were targets in northern 
ireland and abroad 
the ira most of whose members are roman catholic is fighting 
to drive britain out and unite the province with the irish 
republic it is outlawed on both sides of the border 
its latest campaign began monday with the bombing of an army 
barracks in suburban london that killed one soldier and wounded 
nine police said wednesday they were investigating the possibility 
of a woman having smuggled the bomb into the inglis barracks 
saturday night during a disco dance 
in three separate attacks tuesday in northern ireland the ira 
killed a police detective and a parttime soldier and wounded 33 
people gunmen dragged the offduty soldier from a belfast store 
and killed him in front of his wife and 2yearold daughter 
gunmen ambushed mcnicholl near the spot where a land mine blew 
up an ulster defense regiment vehicle tuesday wounding six 
soldiers 
protestant and catholic leaders and the british and irish 
governments condemned the new ira blitz military and police 
chiefs ordered reviews of security 
northern ireland secretary tom king the top british official 
for the province declared terrorism will be beaten and did 
not rule out reviving internment without trial we keep these 
matters under review he said 
britain stopped internment in december 1975 six years after 
sectarian violence began in northern ireland following worldwide 
condemnation 
in dublin prime minister charles haughey said wednesday that 
violence can do nothing to bring about a solution to the tragic 
problems of northern ireland 
referring to possible talks between politicians on both sides of 
the border the irish republics premier said the attacks were 
particularly deplorable in the present context with hopes of 
political progress being encouraged 
col peter macintyre a senior officer of the ulster defense 
regiment said its members would have to review their personal 
security arrangements 
the ira has killed 10 regiment members three policemen and 12 
british soldiers in northern ireland so far this year outside the 
province the guerrillas have killed the soldier at the inglis 
barracks and three british servicemen in west germany and the 
netherlands 
seventeen civilians have lost their lives since november because 
of attacks on security forces bungled by the ira its warning 
tuesday said civilians should keep away from british military 
personnel because their close presence often forces us to abandon 
operations 
king described the ira warning as absolutely hypocritical and 
utterly evil 
british media quoted ira sources in belfast not identified as 
saying civilians should shun pubs and discos frequented by british 
military personnel 
the ira bombed three pubs in england in 1974 and its marxist 
offshot the irish national liberation army bombed a pub in 
northern ireland in 1982 servicemen were among the casualties in 
all the attacks

at home he said people are now more homeoriented they dont 
want to drag their kids to the beach anymore 
some people are taking more drastic measures and leaving the 
state altogether 
ive had a few people mention that they werent going to stay 
here because the beaches are really disgusting said donna 
rubolino manager of uniglobe express travel in toms river 
theyre afraid of stepping on something a lot of people are 
going to the caribbean where the water is blue and clean 
those who stay close to home are flocking to state and county 
parks 
ocean county park lifeguards have estimated daily crowds are up 
30 percent cheesequake state park in old bridge township has 
reached capacity on most weekends so far this summer something 
that usually happens only on holidays 
frank guidotti assistant director of the state division of 
parks amp forestry said good weather certainly has helped park 
attendance but he added that many people might prefer swimming in 
lakes and reservoirs rather than ocean beaches 
some casinos in atlantic city are reporting a busier summer than 
normal but they were hesitant to cite beach pollution as a reason 
most people that come to atlantic city are gamers said 
maryann lobianco a spokeswoman at tropicana hotel and casino a 
beach closing or beach pollution wont necessarily cause people to 
come to atlantic city instead 
meanwhile monmouth county prosecutor john kaye said witnesses 
will be brought before a grand jury to look into possible criminal 
wrongdoing in the operation of the old asbury park sewage plant 
which contributed to high bacteria counts that forced beaches in 
four communities to close last week a new sewage plant opened 
saturday to replace the old plant

long islanders thought theyd seen 
everything wash up on their shores in recent weeks until a beach 
cleaner collected 300 in faded bills from a beach wednesday 
morning 
i couldnt believe my eyes said singleton moorer who 
collected the cash while cleaning the beachfront at the silver 
point club i just kept picking it up and the tide kept washing 
it back out i was so excited 
moorer reported collecting a 100 bill and an assortment of 
20s 10s 5s and singles trapped in clumps of seaweed along the 
tide line quite a switch from the syringes blood vials and 
garbage which have closed beaches this summer 
moorer 38 said he and two colleagues found the money around 
530 am most of it was faded to white and light green by the salt 
water and sunlight he said 
moorer took the cash and bought a big breakfast for himself and 
his colleagues the eightyear veteran of the beachcleaning crew 
said last year he found about 50 
this is a great job moorer said adding the money is more 
than a weeks pay for him 
money has been found washed up on the beaches occasionally said 
beach club spokesman william baumert 
its probably from some poor guy off his boat baumert said 
one thing is for sure this is a nice kind of pollution to have 
wash up for a change 
raw sewage washed up on some miamiarea beaches on wednesday 
following a weekend pipeline rupture that spilled millions of 
gallons of sewage into floridas intracoastal waterway 
the decision to close beaches was made after tests taken from 12 
sites along shoreline parks in northeastern dade county showed 
three of them with coliform bacteria counts above safety levels

the house with only three dissenting votes 
today impeached us district judge alcee l hastings of florida 
and told the senate to try him for high crimes and misdemeanors 
on a vote of 4133 the house sent a resolution containing 17 
articles of impeachment to the senate which might not take up the 
matter until next year if found guilty by a twothirds majority 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida would be 
removed from his 89500 job 
following the vote hastings held a quick news conference on the 
steps of the federal courthouse in miami and said he would not step 
down from the bench he called the vote a dark day for myself and 
the judicial process but added that he expects to prevail in the 
senate 
the vote today in my humble opinion is a disgrace said 
hastings many congresspersons voted with no knowledge of the 
voluminous record that has taken seven years to compile 
hastings downplayed his previous complaints that the 
investigation was racist saying this isnt about racism its 
about fairness 
the resolution charges that hastings 
conspired with washington attorney william borders to receive a 
150000 bribe from two convicted racketeers 
lied about the bribe during a criminal trial and 
compromised three fbi investigations by leaking wiretap 
information over which he had jurisdiction 
one article says that hastings required as a judge to enforce 
and obey the constitution and the laws of the united states did 
undermine confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the 
judiciary and betray the trust of the people of the united states 
and had thus brought disrepute on the federal courts and the 
administration of justice by the federal courts 
as the vote approached rep john conyers dmich chairman of 
the judiciary subcommittee that held hearings on the hastings 
impeachment said that black public officials should meet the same 
standards as white public officials 
lower standards would be patronizing higher standards 
racism he said the problems created here were created by 
judge hastings himself hastings has failed to measure up to 
standards applicable to all judges 
conyers a black received a standing ovation from other members 
when he finished 
hastings had few defenders on the house floor 
rep joseph d early dmass voted present because he 
said hastings had been acquitted by a jury 
here we have an individual who wasnt convicted early said 
what are we going to do with other judges are we going to have 
the judiciary committee come in with impeachment charges every time 
a judge is just accused 
the house judiciary committee in its report supporting the 
resolution said 
impeachment protects our society by insuring that those in the 
highest positions of public trust are held accountable this is 
especially true with respect to members of the federal judiciary 
who barring impeachment enjoy life tenure in office 
before the vote hastings said house members who vote to impeach 
him will rubber stamp racism 
the house impeachment vote marks another dark and dangerous 
day in the house of representatives hastings said in miami on 
tuesday 
it is expected that a number of congresspersons will 
rubberstamp racism and stand the constitution and american 
jurisprudence on its head hastings said in a telephone interview 
two weeks ago the house judiciary committee voted 321 in 
three separate votes on the articles of impeachment against 
hastings the first black appointed to a federal judgeship in 
florida 
although hastings has said he is a victim of double jeopardy of 
blind ignorance and racism he failed to convince the 
committee which has two black members that he did not conspire 
with a washington attorney to take a bribe 
the two black members conyers and rep george w crockett jr 
dmich a former city judge in detroit said they were skeptical 
about the bribery charges at first and wondered whether racism 
could be the source of the allegations against the flamboyant 
hastings 
after the hearings conyers said i couldnt find any 
conyers said the failure by hastings and borders to testify was 
one of the many things that led him to vote for impeachment 
the senate trial might not begin until next year when a new 
congress will be seated 
the principal charge against hastings is that he conspired with 
borders to obtain 150000 from two convicted racketeers in return 
for reducing their sentences 
borders was convicted in a federal court trial but hastings was 
acquitted of the charge in 1983 the issue was raised again by 
judges of the 11th circuit court of appeals which conducted an 
investigation the judges said hastings had engaged in the 
conspiracy and had lied at his trial 
the findings were endorsed by the judicial conference of the 
united states the administrative office of the federal courts 
hastings has said he is innocent his attorney terence j 
anderson said during the congressional hearings i believe the 
judge will be acquitted in the senate 
the house has voted 10 impeachments theyve only won five 
in the past he said one jury was unanimous in its decision 
not guilty i dont think its fair that he must go before a new 
jury seven years and 2 million later once is enough 
others voting present were reps harold e ford dtenn and 
henry b gonzalez dtexas 
voting no were reps gus savage dill mervyn m dymally 
dcalif and edward r roybal dcalif 
eleven members did not vote in addition to speaker jim wright

the world court announced 
wednesday the united states has failed to meet a deadline set by 
the court to determine war reparations to nicaragua 
the united states has been boycotting the world court since 
1984 when the court overruled a us claim that it was not 
authorized to hear a nicaraguan complaint that the reagan 
administration was supporting the antisandinista rebels 
the united states ignored the july 29 deadline to present its 
position in the reparations case a world court spokesman said 
wednesday he spoke on condition of anonymity in line with court 
practice 
there was no immediate comment from washington 
the timelimit has lapsed without the receipt of any 
communication from the government of the united states the 
spokesman said in a reference to the deadline 
the spokesman added that the court would consider the next step 
in the procedure it was not immediately clear whether the court 
was planning hearings in the case 
nicaraguas ambassador to the netherlands who represents his 
nation at the world court could not be reached for comment an 
embassy spokeswoman told the associated press that all diplomats 
involved in the case are currently on holiday in managua she 
refused to give her name 
nicaraguas arguments on the issue were filed in march under 
the courts statutes they are not to be made public before 
hearings are held on the issue 
managua has never publicly stated how much it is seeking in 
compensation but sandinista officials have privately estimated the 
economic damage caused by the war against the usbacked contras 
at 250 million to 300 million 
the current reparations procedure emanates from a 1986 world 
court ruling ordering the united states to immediately halt all 
support to the rebels 
in that ruling which followed a 1984 complaint by managua that 
the united states was involved in attempts to overthrow the 
nicaraguan government the court said that nicaragua was entitled 
to reparations but it declined to indicate the size of them 
instead it ordered both parties in the dispute to negotiate a 
settlement on the issue and said it would intervene only if such 
talks would fail 
reiterating its 1984 claim that the world court has no 
jurisdiction in the dispute the reagan administration has refused 
to consider paying reparations to nicaragua 
in november the court opened proceedings to establish the 
amount of reparations nicaragua is entitled in a letter to the 
court a month later john shad ambassador to the netherlands 
repeated his governments position that the court had no authority 
over the case 
that letter was the last official communication received by the 
court from the us government the court spokesman said 
the court officially known as the international court of 
justice has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary 
adherence to its rulings

after years of tight controls the 
press in south korea enjoys a new freedom from official 
restrictions giving koreans a steady array of reports critical of 
the government 
but journalists say their struggle for press freedom has taken a 
new direction and they still face many problems since president roh 
taewoo took office in feburary with a promise of full democracy 
and an end to authoritarian rule 
now instead of fighting officials reporters and editors face 
an internal struggle for editorial freedom with journalists 
unions playing a major role in the battle 
as an example of the new openness a seoul newspaper recently 
reported rohs daughter was forced to stop using the national 
equestrian teams facilities after officials protested 
presidential aides said roh was not aware that police had probed 
who leaked the story until he read press articles and quickly 
reprimanded police for trying to block news 
i have never seen the president so mad an aide was quoted 
as telling reporters 
a rush to create new newspapers has added to the industrys 
problems with rival publications competing for staff and driving up 
wages 
under public pressure the government withdrew agents from 
newspapers and broadcast stations and stopped issuing daily orders 
that regulated the types of stories and the way they appeared 
laws were revised making it easier for new newspapers and radio 
stations to be set up changes in the press laws created a rush to 
open new newspapers 
one newspaper the hankyoreh shinmun established by hundreds of 
reporters expelled in the 1970s for their antigovernment views 
made a successful start in may increasing to 15 the number of 
daily newspapers in south korea 
fifteen more daily newspapers are preparing to start publication 
before the end of the year the roman catholic church and buddhist 
groups plan to set up radio stations 
the newspaper boom also touched off a war for qualified 
reporters and other staff 
some top photographers have been attracting salaries of up to 
50000 a year while relatively inexperienced reporters are getting 
offers of 30000 and more unusually high salaries by south 
korean standards 
despite the changes and improvement opposition and dissident 
groups argue that there still are legal or institutional obstacles 
on press activity 
we are fighting an uphill battle the korean press is in the 
midst of a transition said lee chunbal president of the 
journalists association of korea which represents some 3000 
reporters he said most outside controls have been removed but 
the news media faces new internal challenges 
rep lee sangsoo spokesman of the largest opposition group 
the party for peace and democracy said the media is packed with 
reporters who prefer a comfortable lifestyle and dont care much 
about pressing issues 
most reporters are relatively affluent and do not seem to care 
much about the needy people who account for a good part of the 
population lee said 
many journalists interviewed said reporters are now struggling 
internally to promote press freedom with editors reporters and 
publishers disagreeing on what course to take 
the pusan ilbo a progovernment newspaper was recently closed 
for several days as unionized reporters went on strike for greater 
editorial control the dispute was settled only after the publisher 
agreed to consider reporters views in appointing a managing editor 
press freedom came as a kind of a windfall as a result of last 
years public struggle for democracy reporters didnt do much in 
the struggle said one senior editor who requested anonymity 
the editor said reporters are now trying to win more editorial 
freedom from managers they see as being closely associated with 
past authoritarian governments labor unions lead the struggle he 
said 
union activity among reporters was negligible in the past but 
now most news organizations have active labor unions whose main 
concern is freedom of the press

wednesday to continue cooperating in the search for missing

former political prisoners in the united states 
the official voice of vietnam radio said the hanoi government 
was temporarily suspending its participation in the programs it 
cited as a hostile policy the state departments opposition to 
a move in congress to establish a lowlevel diplomatic mission in 
hanoi 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley did not retreat from the 
stand taken by assistant secretary of state gaston sigur in 
testifying last month against creation of a socalled us interest 
section in the vietnamese capital 
she said the two sides had agreed that humanitarian issues 
should not be linked to broader political questions such as 
normalization or economic aid 
mrs oakley urged vietnam to continue its cooperation with the 
united states in trying to account for the nearly 1800 americans 
missing in action since the vietnam war 
sigur had testifed that the reagan administration opposed 
normalization of relations with the communist government in hanoi 
until an acceptable solution was found to vietnams military 
presence in neighboring cambodia 
the state department still continues to make foreign policy 
mrs oakley said 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach informed retired 
us army gen john w vessey president reagans special emissary 
of hanois decision in a letter sunday 
the hanoi radio broadcast described sigurs testimony as 
evidence of hostile policy and said vietnam is compelled to 
suspend temporarily joint efforts in the search and exhumation 
of remains of missing in actions as well as the resettlement of 
camp inmates in the united states 
the state department says it has received about 11000 
applications requesting resettlement of former vietnamese political 
prisoners and their families in the united states vietnam said the 
resettlement could involve hundreds of thousands of vietnamese 
thach and vessey agreed a year ago in hanoi that vietnam would 
accelerate its accounting of the mias while the united states would 
help with humanitarian programs such as for those disabled in the 
war 
in letters to vessey last month thach promised to try to 
resolve by the end of the year 70 mia cases which the united states 
has given high priority thach also welcomed joint excavations for 
remains

article 16 as supervising judge judge hastings learned 
highly confidential information from a wiretap on sept 6 1985

article 17 through his corrupt relationship with borders false 
testimony fabrication of false documents submitted as trial

information hastings did undermine confidence in the integrity 
and impartiality of the judiciary and betray the trust of the 
people thereby bringing disrepute on the federal courts and the 
administration of justice

in an unprecedented case the house approved 
17 articles of impeachment wednesday against us district judge 
alcee l hastings of miami despite his acquittal in a previous 
bribery trial 
the house action which is tantamount to an indictment sent the 
case to the senate for trial where conviction by a twothirds 
majority is required for hastings removal from the federal bench 
the senate has not announced a trial date 
the 4133 vote marked the first time the house has ever 
impeached a federal official who was acquitted of similar charges 
in a criminal trial 
it also was the first time that a black official has been 
defendant in impeachment proceedings 
hastings who is the first black us district judge in florida 
retreated wednesday from his previous contentions that the 
impeachment proceedings were racially motivated this isnt about 
racism its about fairness he said 
at an impromptu news conference on the steps of the federal 
courthouse in miami hastings said his impeachment was a dark day 
for myself and the judicial process but that he is confident he 
will prevail in the senate 
at stake is hastings 89500ayear lifetime job on the 
federal bench he was nominated by president carter in 1979 
the vote today in my humble opinion is a disgrace 
hastings said many congresspersons voted with no knowledge of 
the voluminous record that has taken seven years to compile 
he added i am petrified at their uncaring undignified and 
in my judgment unconstitutional approach to this matter 
hastings accused the house of acting hastily so its members 
could concentrate on reelection campaigns 
with wednesdays vote the house has impeached 15 federal 
officials in its history twelve cases have gone to trial in the 
senate two officials resigned prior to senate proceedings and five 
all federal judges have been convicted by the senate and 
removed from office 
the last to be ousted was us district judge harry e claiborne 
of las vegas nev who was convicted of high crimes and 
misdemeanors in october 1986 while serving a federal prison term 
for tax evasion 
the basic charge against hastings contained in article 1 
paralleled the criminal charges on which he was acquitted in 1983 
article 1 accused hastings and washington attorney william 
borders of conspiring in 1981 to obtain a 150000 payment from two 
convicted racketeers in exchange for lenient sentencing and return 
of forfeited assets 
borders was convicted and hastings acquitted at separate 
criminal trials 
articles 2 through 15 accused hastings of lying at his 1983 
trial on various aspects of the case 
article 16 says hastings in a separate case revealed highly 
confidential information obtained through a wiretap to dade 
county mayor stephen clark 
the 17th article said hastings actions undermine confidence 
in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and bring 
disrepute on the federal courts and the administration of justice 
 
after hastings acquittal a special panel of judges from the 
11th us circuit court of appeals which covers florida 
recommended that the house consider impeaching hastings the 
panels conclusions were endorsed unanimously by the judicial 
conference the policymaking body of the federal judiciary 
rep john conyers dmich a black whose house judiciary 
subcommittee investigated hastings said racists are probably 
gloating and delighted over the charges against hastings 
but conyers strongly defended the articles of impeachment 
conyers said he was initially very suspicious of the reagan 
administrations prosecution of hastings because it had nominated 
only a halfdozen blacks as lower court judges and only one as an 
appeals court judge 
but conyers said he concluded after his investigation that the 
problems created here have been created by judge hastings himself 
he added black public officials must be held to the same 
standard as all other public officials a lower standard would be 
patronizing a higher standard would be racist just as race should 
never disqualify a person from office race should never insulate a 
person from the consequences of wrongful conduct 
rep peter w rodino jr dnj chairman of the full judiciary 
committee dismissed suggestions that hastings was the victim of 
double jeopardy the legal prohibition against being tried twice on 
the same charges 
rodino said an impeachment trial is not a criminal proceeding 
and therefore the two are separate and distinct 
rep george gekas rpa said this look that we have just 
given into the conduct of alcee hastings makes one sick in the 
stomach 
voting against impeachment were reps gus savage dill mervyn 
m dymally dcalif and edward r roybal dcalif 
rep joseph d early dmass voted present because he 
said hastings had been acquitted by a trial jury 
here we have an individual who wasnt convicted early said 
what are we going to do with other judges are we going to have 
the judiciary committee come in with impeachment charges every time 
a judge is just accused

president reagan vetoed a 2995 billion 
pentagon budget bill wednesday charging congressional democrats 
with partisan politics and saying the bill would signal weakness 
and accommodation in us defense policy 
although the bill has become entangled in electionyear politics 
and leading republicans had urged the president to veto it reagan 
disavowed any political motives 
these are issues of national security and they must remain 
above partisan politics he said 
the partisan politics is on the other side he added 
the bill essentially would have authorized the spending levels 
reagan sought but sought to rearrange spending priorities 
administration officials complained that the legislation contained 
language that would have tied the presidents hands on future arms 
control negotiations with the soviet union 
reagan also objected to the bill on grounds it would cripple 
the very concept behind star wars his spacebased missile 
defense system 
the president made his announcement after walking into the white 
house press briefing room with a copy of the bulky bill in his 
hands 
the bill would signal a basic change in the direction of our 
national defense he said a change away from strength and 
proven success and back toward weakness and accommodation of the 
1970s 
sen edward m kennedy dmass responding to the veto said 
reagan faces a difficult test between now and november to 
maintain a proper separation between his roles as president and 
political campaigner on this issue he should not have abdicated 
his responsibility to the country as president and 
commanderinchief he should have signed the defense bill 
rep tony coelho dcalif the thirdranking democrat in the 
house noted that vice president george bush had supported the veto 
and said if he wants pentagon mismanagement debated for the 
next few months that is all right with us george bush wants to 
play politics the defense veto will come back to haunt them 
bush is the certain republican presidential nominee 
the veto may be difficult to override in the 
democraticcontrolled congress particularly in the house it 
passed both chambers july 14 by votes generally along party lines 
the vote was 229183 in the house and 6430 in the senate it takes 
a twothirds vote of both houses to override 
rep william dickinson rala ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said i expect there will be an override 
attempt but i think we will sustain the presidents veto he 
called it a bad bill 
senate gop leader bob dole rkan said reagan made the right 
decision for only one reason the right reason the bill does 
not serve the national security interests of the united states 
reagan said the bill would mean unilateral concessions to the 
soviets concessions that would reduce my bargaining leverage at 
the conference table at the very moment when that leverage has 
produced its most fruitful results the president said 
i have been patient as the liberals in congress attempted to 
erode our military strength the strength that has provided the 
basis for our diplomatic success he said but i can be patient 
no longer congress needs to get back to work and come up with a 
bill i can sign 
when asked whether he expected congress to produce a bill before 
adjourning the president replied that the defense appropriations 
bill now being considered a separate bill that actually provides 
the defense department with the funds authorized in the vetoed 
measure is one that i could sign and would sign he did not 
elaborate but the appropriations bill contains fewer arms control 
restrictions than the authorization measure 
reagan said the authorization bill would also have crippled the 
concept behind star wars or the strategic defense initiative of 
creating a space shield against nuclear attack 
and i will not abide this particularly in view of the 
technical progress that sdi is making he said 
they say this bill would take the stars out of star wars 
said reagan with my veto today i am putting back the i 
initiative in sdi 
we know there is a partisan position in which there are a 
great many there who just dont want sdi at all he said well 
i think they are bucking the tide 
the strategic defense initiative would receive 4 billion in the 
bill slightly more than the current sdi budget of 39 billion but 
far less than the 48 billion reagan wanted 
in addition the bill reduces spending for a spacebased 
interceptor that is under development as the first phase of an 
eventual sdi program the pentagon wanted 330 million but the 
bill restricts the total to 85 million 
the measure requires retirement of three aging missilefiring 
poseidon submarines as new subs are built continuing a policy of 
generally keeping the united states near weapons limits imposed by 
the unratified salt ii nuclear treaty reagan opposes this policy 
defense secretary frank c carlucci who is visiting the soviet 
union said in a statement released at the pentagon that he fully 
supported the veto 
as passed the legislation was seriously flawed because of 
the arms control restrictions and provisions reducing funding for 
star wars and modernization of nuclear missiles carlucci said 
these concerns were expressed to the congress over the past 
two months and i regret that they were not accommodated in the 
bill presented to the president he added

thousands of masked students marched 
through downtown rangoon on wednesday to denounce new hardline 
leader sein lwin witnesses said and he put the burmese capital 
under martial law 
some saffronrobed buddhist monks joined in and workers swelled 
the ranks as the procession moved toward the western part of the 
city the witnesses said no violence was reported unlike student 
riots in march and june 
sein lwin a former army general is widely held responsible for 
ruthless suppression of the march riots in which up to 100 people 
were killed 
rangoon radio monitored in bangkok said the government imposed 
martial law to preserve security safeguard property and allow 
students who so desire to study in peace it said summary trials 
might be held in some cases 
president sein lwins decree did not say whether a curfew was 
put on rangoons 35 million inhabitants it said martial law would 
cease when the council of state so declares 
as read on the official radio the decree said students 
demonstrated delivered speeches and spread pamphlets at burmas 
most sacred shrine the shwedagon pagoda from july 28 until 
tuesday 
today on 3 august 1988 about 200 students joining forces 
with some people intent on causing riotous disturbances made 
protest marches en masse and started disturbances and a situation 
arose which regional organs of power can no longer control it 
said 
the council of state has authorized the chief of staff to 
declare that a state of emergency exists and to declare martial law 
in townships of the rangoon municipal area 
western diplomats reached by telephone in rangoon provided 
witness accounts of 3000 students marching through the city faces 
covered with handkerchiefs stockings and other masks so 
authorities could not identify them hey reported no violence and 
said police were not in evidence 
one said the marchers were very well organized very peaceful 
they would form rings around cars so there would be no damage 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the us embassy reported no violence or arrests 
most protesters appeared to be high school students the 
witnesses said 
diplomats said the march moved along merchant street past 
decaying edifices of british colonial days and the newer american 
and indian embassies through spacious maha bandoola park and 
around centuriesold sule pagoda 
according to the reports most protesters had marched westward 
by midafternoon and were joined by large crowds from workingclass 
neighborhoods 
security forces took over the shwedagon pagoda a traditional 
center for political agitation on tuesday and sealed it off from 
students the diplomats said 
on tuesday the official news agency burma said 100 to 200 
teenagers raised the peacock flag a symbol of burmas struggle 
for independence from britain on the base platform of shwedagons 
soaring golddecked central spire it urged parents to control 
their children and avoid disturbances 
foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone and 
by monitoring official media because of restrictions on their entry 
to rangoon the only legal gateway to burma for most outsiders 
foreign reporters usually entered the country in the past on 
tourist visas issued at burmese embassies 
virtually all institutions of higher learning were closed after 
the june riots high schools have remained open but attendance was 
reported low and hours sometimes were shortened 
the emergency decree puts the chief of staff burmese usage for 
the armed forces commander in charge of administering justice the 
current commander is gen sau maung a close associate of sein 
lwin who delegated martial law authority to brig gen myo nyunt 
military chief in rangoon 
sein lwin has admitted that official corruption waste and 
almost deathlike immobility have caused a serious loss of faith 
in the government according to remarks made available wednesday 
speaking tuesday to the countrys top leadership sein lwin also 
said the government should implement economic reforms dismantling 
part of burmas rigid socialist system 
he was elected as president and chairman of the ruling burma 
socialist program party last week after the resignation of ne win 
who had ruled burma since a coup 26 years ago pamphlets 
circulating in rangoon have called him a ruthless oppressor and 
urged that he be overthrown 
diplomats in rangoon have said sein lwin appears ready to make 
some economic reforms while also putting down dissent to rob 
popular opposition movements of potential leaders 
those arrested to date include burmas most respected and vocal 
dissident aung gyi and associated press correspondent sein win 
they have been accused of attacking the state 
louis d boccardi president and general manager said in a 
letter to sein lwin the ap was deeply concerned about sein 
wins detention and would appreciate further information and 
clarification of the charges

the head of the government fund that insures 
commercial bank deposits said wednesday it could cost slightly 
under 50 billion to restore the health of the rival savings and 
loan industry 
that appraisal offered to the house banking committee by 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman falls 
short of private analysts guesses which range up to 100 billion 
but it is nearly twice as high as other official government 
estimates 
the federal home loan bank board the regulator of the nations 
3100 savings institutions last month put the price tag at 31 
billion within the 26 billion to 36 billion range offered by the 
general accounting office congress auditing arm 
some in congress and the reagan administration dismiss the 
shifting estimates as a numbers game but seidmans estimate is 
likely to lend new urgency to the debate over whether taxpayers 
money is needed to bail out the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp 
until now official estimates have been low enough to support an 
argument that the fslic which expects to have 425 billion in 
revenue over the next 10 years can get by without taxpayer money 
however if seidmans 50 billion cost estimate is on target 
there is little question that the fslic needs more money seidman 
said the bank boards revenue projections also are on the 
optimistic side 
he added we estimate the problem is getting worse at 
something like 1 billion a month 
although seidmans agency insures commercial banks not savings 
and loan associations it is studying the fslics problems because 
some have proposed merging the two insurance funds a move seidman 
and banks oppose 
rep charles schumer dny said members of congress regard 
bank board estimates as overly optimistic and were likely to give 
more credence to seidmans number 
seidman said his own agency which last friday announced 
potentially the largest bank rescue ever will suffer its first 
loss this year since its founding in 1934 
the fdic is spending 4 billion to assist the takeover of first 
republicbank corp of dallas by ncnb corp of charlotte nc 
seidman had said he expected to recover part of that 
on wednesday he estimated for the first time a figure for the 
ultimate cost 2 billion to 3 billion 
if that proves true the first republicbank rescue would surpass 
the 1984 bailout of continental illinois corp of chicago the fdic 
initially spent 45 billion in that transaction but expects to 
recover all but 17 billion 
seidman slightly worsened the projections for the fdic fund 
which ended 1987 with 183 billion previously he has said it 
could decline by as much as 10 percent 
on wednesday he said well go down 10 12 13 percent to 
16 billion 155 billion something like that 
he also said that banks closed or requiring fdic assistance to 
stay open will surpass last years postdepression record of 203 
ninetyeight banks have failed so far this year and 17 others 
received government assistance 
with the first republicbank transaction eight of the 10 largest 
banks in texas have been recapitalized either by the government or 
privately for one of the two remaining we may have to provide 
assistance we dont know at this time seidman said 
he declined to identify the institution but he was believed to 
be talking about mcorp a dallas bank that has been trying to 
raise private capital

recent rains in the ohio and mississippi 
valleys havent ended the nations severe drought and the outlook 
remains bleak the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
reported wednesday 
some areas remain more than 10 inches short of normal rainfall 
since april the agency reported significant amounts of rainfall 
over large areas are needed to promote any longterm relief 
the latest 30day forecast indicates that hot weather will 
continue in drought areas although there is some chance of 
increased moisture over the next three months noaas latest 
drought advisory said 
the rains that did occur took place when the highaltitude jet 
stream a powerful wind moving weather patterns across the nation 
from the west moved closer to normal conditions noaa reported 
while the jet had been split in june into two streams passing 
north and south of the united states trapping hot dry weather in 
between the southern portion faded in july 
with the decline of the southern jet some wetness from the gulf 
of mexico was able to move into the central and southeastern states 
the northern jet edged southward closer to its normal route but 
still carrying most pacific ocean wetness north of the canadian 
border the agency said 
the most obvious needs as indicated by regions with less than 
50 percent of normal rain since april 1 are in the northern and 
southern mississippi valley as well as much of the missouri 
valley noaa said 
despite recent rains many parts of the nation remain below 50 
percent of normal rainfall and continued dryness will expand that 
area considerably officials said 
in addition the advisory said dryness in sections of the 
northern rocky mountains and the high plains has increased 
significantly within the past week and these conditions have been 
associated with a number of major forest fires 
as of july 23 the agency reported 59 percent of the nations 
corn and soybean growing areas were suffering from severe or 
extreme drought still below the 89 percent posted in july 1934 
even so drought conditions are comparable with some of the 
worst in the 1930s the agency said 
streamflow remains at very low levels over much of the nation 
affecting river traffic and reservoir levels are generally below 
normal the report said

mathias rust the young west 
german pilot whose landing in red square triggered a soviet 
military shakeup arrived in frankfurt today after being freed 
from a soviet prison earlier in the day 
rust admitted that his daring flight more than a year ago was 
not responsible but contended that his experience had improved 
sovietwest german relations 
on the flight from moscow rust told the associated press that 
his landing on red square was only the beginning of his efforts 
to draw east and west together 
i will continue the work but no crimes only legal things 
he told the ap 
asked if he had it do over again if he would make the 
unauthorized flight that drew the kremlins ire he answered no 
not again it was not responsible 
airport spokesman john sturm told the associated press the 
lufthansa jetliner carrying rust landed in frankfurt at 924 pm 
324 pm edt 
the soviet news agency tass earlier reported that rust has 
just taken a flight from moscow to the frg federal republic of 
germany 
a spokesman for the west german embassy confirmed that rust was 
aboard a lufthansa jet that left moscows sheremetyevo airport 
shortly after 8 pm 
the embasssy spokesman who demanded anonymity said rust was 
taken directly to the airport from lefortovo prison where he had 
been held since his flight in may 1987 
tass said the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys 
highest executive body decreed earlier in the day that the 
20yearold rust be freed from further serving his term and 
expelled from the soviet union 
tass said rusts release after having served just over a quarter 
of a fouryear sentence demonstrated the soviet unions 
humaneness there was no further explanation for the early 
release 
tass quoted rust as saying i realize that i have committed 
serious criminal offenses and the fact that the presidium of the 
ussr supreme soviet freed me from punishment before i served my 
term is an act of humanism 
i think this also attests to the overall improvement of 
relations between our two countries rust was quoted as saying 
on may 28 1987 rust then 19 flew a cessna aircraft to moscow 
from helsinki finland landing on red square 
he was found guilty sept 4 1987 of illegally entering the 
soviet union violating international flight rules and malicious 
hooliganism and sentenced to four years in a soviet labor camp 
he had been at moscows lefortovo prison until today 
tass said rust told one of its correspondents that he had no 
complaints about his treatment in captivity but was eager to return 
to his family and friends 
mathias rust is free west germanys frankfurter rundschau 
newspaper trumpeted in a banner headline after rusts release was 
announced 
but west germanys zdf television network quoted the 
prosecutors office in the west german city of itzehoe as saying 
that an investigation against rust was still open the prosecutor 
has been investigating possible charges of endangering air traffic 
and fraud against rust 
rust comes from the town of wedel six miles west of the 
northern port city of hamburg an associated press reporter tried 
to speak with rusts mother monika today but was turned away from 
the family home by three reporters from west germanys stern 
magazine the magazine has an exclusive contract with rusts family 
for the rights to rusts story 
the family has an unlisted telephone number 
officials in west germany said that west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher discussed the case of rust with soviet 
officials during genschers visit to moscow last week 
genscher was in moscow to prepare for the scheduled october 
summit between west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
michael gerdts genschers spokesman told reporters that 
mathias rust was a topic in talks between the foreign minister 
and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in moscow 
a west german government spokesman in moscow who spoke on 
condition he not be indentified said the soviets contacted the 
embassy early today to say that rust would be freed the source 
would not discuss any reasons behind the early release 
in bonn west german government spokesman norbert shaefer told 
the associated press the federal government is pleased with this 
step 
rusts dramatic flight shook the foundation of soviet security 
and oiled the way for the ouster of defense minister sergei l 
sokolov and air defense chief alexander koldunov 
soviet jets scrambled to intercept rusts light plane when it 
was detected crossing into soviet airspace but no action was taken 
to halt the flight and apparently no word of warning about the 
incident was sent forward to moscow 
gorbachev and sokolov were in berlin at the time two days after 
rusts landing and arrest sokolov was sent into retirement for the 
lapse and koldunov was fired 
rust told the soviet court during his trial that he made the 
flight to advance understanding between east and west but the 
court ruled that he acted in the interest of selfpromotion and 
issued a guilty verdict on all counts against him

observatory in cambridge mass said they have found what might 
be a very large planet orbiting a star 90 light years away 
in an independent study an astronomer from the university of 
victoria british columbia said he has found evidence of planets 
orbiting nine stars and suggested that as many as half of the 
stars in the milky way galaxy may have planetary companions 
bruce campbell chief of the canadian team said his result 
showing that the majority of stars in the galaxy perhaps have 
planetary systems could be interpreted as a sign that there are 
also earthlike planets suitable for life but we have no evidence 
of that at all 
it makes it easier to speculate than it was a few years ago 
when there were zero planetary candidates said david w latham 
leader of the smithsonian team we can start to speculate now 
about how often life evolved 
both teams of astronomers made the discoveries by analyzing the 
color shift of light collected from stars light from a distant 
source changes color slightly if the light source is moving it 
shifts toward red if it is moving away and toward blue if moving 
toward the observer 
by carefully measuring this shift the astronomers are able to 
detect wobble or movement of the stars this movement can be 
caused only by the gravitational effect of a nearby body and the 
velocity of the movement allows the scientists to calculate the 
size of the object 
latham said the planetlike object he found is about 20 times 
the size of jupiter and is orbiting so close to star hd 114762 
that it would bemuch hotter than an oven 
its not a place you would go to to look for life he said 
the object said latham is about 3000 times the size of earth 
and is on the very edge of what is commonly thought to be the 
maximum size for a planet 
star hd 114762 is 90 light years about 522 trillion miles 
from earth 
campbell said he and his canadian group used a technique even 
more sensitive than the instruments used by latham and were able to 
find nine planetary objects after studying just 18 stars 
the clearest data he said shows that a large planet orbits a 
star called tau ceti 
we see in the star the effects of a companion sized on the 
order of jupiter said campbell 
eight other planetlike objects were found about other stars he 
said but the team was unable to make a precise measure of their 
size 
we can only infer masses on the order of 1 to 10 times that of 
jupiter said campbell 
all of the stars studied by the canadian team are bright about 
magnitude 4 they all are similar in size to the sun and all are 
within 100 light years about 580 trillion miles from earth 
lathams study using the oak ridge observatory in harvard 
mass concentrated on very faint stars and hd 114762 is of a 7 
magnitude too faint for sighting by the naked eye stars grow 
fainter as the number increases on the magnitude scale a magnitude 
of 6 is the faintest visible to the naked eye 
none of the discovered planets could actually be seen by the 
astronomers because they are blotted out by the brightness of the 
stars 
seeing these objects would be like placing a speck of dust 
beside a 1000watt bulb and trying to see it from miles away 
said latham 
campbell said the instruments now used are not sensitive enough 
to detect a planet as small as the earth 
latham said the object near star hd 114762 has an orbital period 
of 8384 days and the smithsonian team collected data on 30 cycles 
over a sevenyear period the results have been confirmed by 
independent observations of a swiss astronomer 
there have been a lot of claims about finding planets but 
this is the first with a strong technical support because we have 
observed it over such a period of time latham said 
such objects could not be seen until the development in recent 
years of instruments able to substantially amplify and measure the 
light from stars 
now with this new data said astronomer tsevi mazeh of the 
university of tel aviv a new era is beginning 
it makes it more plausible to assume now that there could be 
earthlike planets with life out there he said

the united states is investigating the death 
of a man believed to be the first american to die in the 
israelioccupied west bank since the palestinian revolt began last 
december the state department said wednesday 
we deeply regret the death of mr ribhi barakat kayed on july 
30 in an incident involving israeli soldiers said department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
she said the us consulate in jerusalem was in contact with 
members of kayeds family and was interviewing witnesses in an 
attempt to determine what happened last saturday kayed is from 
columbus ohio 
the us embassy in tel aviv has raised this tragic incident 
with the government of israel and will do so again once the 
investigation is completed she said 
mrs oakley said kayed was the first american of palestinian 
origin to die in the uprising that began dec 8 since then more 
than 260 palestinians have been killed in clashes with israeli 
soldiers 
kayeds family alleges that the 67yearold man was pulled out 
of his house by israeli soldiers and ordered to clean up 
antiisraeli graffiti on a nearby wall while complying kayed 
collapsed and died they said 
his relatives said the soldiers refused to allow kayed to get 
his medication although they were told he had a heart condition 
the israeli army disputing the claim said soldiers had told 
kayeds grandson to clean the slogans and that kayed himself was 
asked to go into the house he probably died of a heart attack the 
army said 
george moses chairman of the council of presidents of national 
arab american associations said the state departments response 
was inadequate 
moses accused richard schifter assistant secretary of state for 
human rights of failing to take a more forceful public stance on 
israeli human rights abuses we believe this abject failure led 
directly to this incident he said

an appeals council ruled wednesday that a 
palestinian held here is the man wanted in the united states for 
the 1982 inflight bombing of a pan am jetliner opening the way 
for his eventual extradition 
police have said his imprisonment may have figured in the 
terrorist attack on a greek cruise ship last month 
palestine liberation organization officials said they would 
fight extradition 
the palestinian held in prison and whose extradition is being 
sought by the united states is mohammed rashid not mohammed 
hamdan as he claims said the ruling issued by the threemember 
council after a closeddoor session 
the council decides whether cases should proceed for action it 
was convened to determine the identity of the prisoner arrested by 
police at athens airport may 29 after a tip from the us embassy 
the united states has asked for the extradition of mohammed 
rashid 39 on charges of planting a bomb aboard a pan am jumbo jet 
in 1982 the blast killed a japanese teenager and injured 15 
people as the jet flew over hawaii 
the appeals council accepted the finding of district attorney 
ioannis lambropoulos and rejected rashids claim that police had 
arrested the wrong man 
an extradition hearing was set for thursday under greek law 
however rashid cannot be extradited until he has served a 
sevenmonth jail sentence for entering greece on a forged syrian 
passport in the name of mohammed hamdan the palestinian was 
convicted of the passport charge and sentenced on july 11 
police theorized that a machinegun and hand grenade attack 
aboard the city of poros cruise ship on july 11 may have been a 
failed attempt to take passengers hostage and force the 
palestinians release the attack killed nine people and injured 
98 the vessel was carrying 471 foreign passengers 
greek authorities have been stymied in their investigation of 
the attack 
us officials have said rashid also was involved in a bomb 
blast aboard a twa jetliner flying over greece in 1986 four 
americans were killed in the explosion but the twa bombing is not 
mentioned in the extradition request 
the diplomatic adviser of the plo mission in greece anwar 
akraa told the appeals council the palestinian was a member of the 
plo which knew him as mohammed hamdan 
rashid dressed in tan trousers and shirt refused to comment 
after testifying before the appeals council 
he was identified when his fingerprints matched those of 
mohammed rashid jailed in greece from 197376 on narcotics 
smuggling charges his prints also matched interpol records police 
said

a wateronly fast by united farm workers 
president cesar chavez is endangering his health and he faces the 
threat of kidney failure a doctor who examined him said 
chavezs uric acid is three times the acceptable level said dr 
augusto ortiz who also examined chavez during a 1972 fast the 
fast entered its 18th day wednesday and chavez has not said how 
long it will continue he went 25 days without food in 1968 and 
again in 1972 to advance farm worker issues 
if this level is not brought down it can lead to serious 
complications including kidney failure ortiz said in a 
statement released by union officials 
chavez is fasting to promote the unions boycott of california 
table grapes he has no contract among those growers and is 
demanding that use of five pesticides be abolished in a july 25

mathias rust flew home wednesday 
after being released early from his soviet prison sentence for 
buzzing the kremlin spires and the young pilot admitted that his 
1987 stunt was an irresponsible act 
i arrived as a child now i go back as an adult its really 
remarkable rust said in an interview with the associated press 
on a lufthansa flight from moscow to frankfurt 
the 20yearold who stunned the world and embarrassed the red 
army brass by piloting a singleenging plane from finland through 
the vaunted soviet air defenses and landing in red square said in 
the future he would commit no crimes 
calm and bordering on smugness the bespectacled young man said 
he would wait to tell the world the whole story of his 15 months in 
the nearly empty lefortovo prison but he did say he felt isolation 
and despair during his time behind bars although he was treated 
well 
asked why he thought the soviets released him early from his 
fouryear sentence for malicious mischief rust said only 
humanity 
would it do it over again if he could no not again he 
replied it was not responsible 
he described the flight as only the beginning of his efforts 
to draw east and west together 
i will continue the work but no crimes only legal things 
he told the ap he spoke mostly in english with a smattering of 
german and russian 
rust sporting a short haircut and dressed in a blue plaid 
sports jacket blue slacks and a blueandred tie seemed exuberant 
and looked healthy adding that rather than losing weight in 
prison he had gained some 
he said he had exercised regularly read a lot and repaired 
books at the prison library he had high praise for his jailers and 
the conditions he endured 
its very nice because a year ago people thought you would be 
tortured in prison rust said they thought kgb good 
heavens no we see there is no torture no adverse conditions 
he added they treat people there like we do in our country 
during the threehour flight from moscow rust was invited into 
cockpit and chatted for several minutes with pilot werner winkler 
he sat in first class munching butter cookies accepting accolades 
from fellow passengers and signing autographs 
a stewardess gave him a small plastic airplane a gesture that 
elicited laughs and a few sweeps with the plastic model 
earlier wednesday the official tass news agency quoted him as 
saying i realize that i have committed serious criminal offenses 
and the fact that the presidium of the ussr supreme soviet 
freed me from punishment before i served my term is an act of 
humanism 
the west german media hailed his release although a tv station 
reported that rust could face more charges for his stunt once he 
returns home to wedel near hamburg 
tass said the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys 
highest executive body decreed earlier in the day that rust be 
freed from further serving his term and expelled from the soviet 
union 
mathias rust is free the frankfurter rundschau newspaper 
trumpeted in a banner headline wednesday after his release was 
announced in moscow underneath was a picture of the bespectacled 
rust with his tousled hair 
west germanys zdf television network reported on that rust 
still may have to answer before a west german court quoting the 
prosecutors office in the city of itzehoe as saying that an 
investigation against rust was still open the prosecutor has been 
investigating possible charges of endangering air traffic and fraud 
against rust 
rust will soon be questioned about that the network said 
a reporter who tried to speak with rusts mother monika was 
turned away from the family home by three reporters from hamburgs 
stern magazine which has an exclusive contract with the family for 
the rights to his story 
tass accused rust of an unprecedented act of hooliganism in 
the air when he penetrated soviet airspace in a singleengine 
cessna on may 28 1987 near the air corridor used by international 
flights approaching moscows sheremetyevo airport 
rusts dramatic flight from helsinki finland across soviet 
estonia and on to moscow shook the foundation of soviet security 
and prompted the ouster of defense minister sergei l sokolov and 
air defense chief alexander koldunov 
soviet jets scrambled to intercept rusts plane when it was 
detected crossing into soviet airspace but no action was taken to 
halt the flight and apparently no word of warning about the 
incident was sent forward to moscow 
a tourist videotaped the final minutes of rusts flight 
capturing the cessna gentle swoop over red square before coming to 
rest before dozens of stunned spectators rust then 19 greeting 
bewildered onlookers after his landing on the cobblestones 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and sokolov were in berlin at 
the time of rusts flight for a warsaw pact meeting two days after 
rusts landing and arrest sokolov was sent into retirement for the 
lapse and koldunov was fired 
rust said at his trial that he made the flight to promote world 
peace but the soviet supreme court said rust was interested in 
promoting himself 
he was found guilty sept 4 1987 of illegally entering the 
soviet union violating international flight rules and malicious 
hooliganism and sentenced to four years in a soviet labor camp 
he remained in lefortovo however 
having served just over a quarter of the term to which he was 
sentenced by the court mathias rust was released the soviet union 
has shown its humaneness again tass said 
the west german government had worked for rusts release and 
government spokesman norbert shaefer told the associated press in 
bonn that the federal government is pleased with this step 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher specifically brought up 
the rust case when he traveled to moscow for talks with gorbachev 
and other soviet leaders last week to prepare for the scheduled 
october summit between gorbachev and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl

a high state department official disputing 
news accounts said thursday the foreign ministers of four central 
american countries shared a us commitment to authentic 
democracy in nicaragua 
morris busby special us envoy to the region said the united 
states was pleased with the results of the session monday in 
guatemala with secretary of state george p shultz reporting 
this was a failed initiative just wasnt true he said 
busby said the statement issued after shultzs meeting with the 
four ministers represented a shared commitment to authentic 
democracy even though it addressed issues in broad terms 
the communique did not mention nicaragua and was limited to 
general support for democratic principles news accounts from 
guatemala said shultz and the foreign ministers of costa rica el 
salvador guatemala and honduras had failed to agree on a strong 
denunciation of nicaragua 
shultz will return to the region next wednesday after touring 
south america for meetings with the leaders of the four central 
american countries 
busby told reporters at a briefing that the ministers had 
decided not to issue an analysis of the nicaraguan situation 
there was a disagreement over whether it was too bold he said 
but busby said i would disagree that we came away 
disappointed the results the meeting produced were important 
shultz did not seek a meeting with nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega and does not plan to talk to him when they attend a 
presidential inauguration ceremony in ecuador or when shultz 
returns to central america 
busby said us policy rules out a meeting with sandinista 
officials until progress is made in their negotiations with the 
usbacked guerrillas known as contras

the reagan administration and congressional 
critics of selling weapons to kuwait have reached agreement on an 
arms package for the arab nation which includes some maverick 
missiles two of the critics said wednesday 
kuwait has agreed to certain restrictions aimed at preventing 
the weapons from being used against israel and the deal should go 
ahead said reps larry smith dfla and mel levine dcalif 
the reagan administration told congress a month ago that it 
intended to sell 19 billion worth of f18 jets and missiles to 
the tiny arab nation at the top of the persian gulf the missiles 
were to include mavericks sidewinders sparrows and harpoons 
kuwait said it wanted the weapons to defend itself against iran 
but critics said the jets and the missiles could be turned against 
israel the senate voted to strip the mavericks from the sale 
under the compromise said smith the sale of the 40 f18s will 
go ahead but the delivery date will be delayed one year to 1994 
the original intention was to deliver the planes by 1993 kuwait 
will be required to return one of its aging usmade a4 planes 
for each f18 it receives 
the deal will only include the g antiship version of the 
maverick rather than the more sophisticated d maverick smith 
said 
in addition kuwait will be prohibited from buying equipment 
that would permit inflight refueling of the f18s a ban which 
would mean the jets couldnt be used to fly against israel 
we have altered this package so that it now satisfies the 
legitimate defense needs of the kuwaitis and reduces its potential 
as an offensive threat to the region or to israel smith said at 
a news conference 
after the senate decision last month to bar the maverick portion 
of the deal kuwait announced that it had reached a separate 
weapons deal with the soviet union 
administration officials had pushed for the kuwaiti deal as a 
way of assuring mideast nations that the united states could be a 
reliable supplier saudi arabia agreed to buy sophisticated weapons 
from the british after a us arms package ran into congressional 
opposition 
for the past 13 months the united states has been escorting 
reflagged kuwaiti tankers in the gulf protecting the ships from 
iranian attacks

jordan river defrocked preacher jimmy swaggart blessed his three 
grandchildren wednesday then immersed their heads in the cool 
water and baptized them 
the midday ceremony was a highlight of the tv evangelists 
eightday tour of holy sites in israel and the occupied west bank 
he is accompanied by about 350 followers 
before the baptism swaggart sat on the stone embankment and 
explained the significance of the ceremony to his granchildren 
jennifer kay 11 gabriel lee 8 and matthew aaron 7 
by being baptized you will be saved swaggart said as 
matthew aaron fidgeted beside him 
following the childrens baptism more than 200 of swaggarts 
followers formed a line along the embankment some weeping to wait 
their turn to step into the water many wore white robes or dresses 
over their bathing suits 
do you acknowledge the lord as the lord of your life 
ministers traveling with the group asked the pilgrims are you 
born again and promise to live for him for the rest of your life 
the pilgrims answered yes before the minisers dipped them 
backward into the water swaggart only baptized his grandchildren 
to be baptized in the jordan river is an unspeakable joy 
said anne marie murray 45 of new haven conn ive never felt 
so close to the lord 
its great very significant because jesus was baptized in the 
jordan said a beaming morris jones 51 of morgan hill calif 
after stepping out of the water 
the ceremony took place in a shaded section of the river on the 
southern tip of the sea of galilee that is set aside for baptisms 
according to the bible jesus was anointed by john the baptist 
in the jordan river but the exact site is not known 
roman catholics and other denominations mark the baptism once a 
year at river sites near the biblical city of jericho about 20 
miles east of jerusalem 
since arriving in israel july 29 swaggart and his entourage 
have visited jerusalem bethlehem and a nearby jewish settlement 
swaggart has said he came in part to express support for 
israel which has been the target of international crticism for its 
crackdown on the 8monthold palestinian uprising 
swaggart who runs a tv ministry that reaches 2 million viewers 
from its base in baton rouge la stepped down from the pulpit in 
february after confessing to sinning against his wife a prostitute

parents often overlook the emotional 
impact sending a child to college has on their own lives 
especially if its the youngest son or daughter says a campus 
psychologist 
they have to rethink their whole lives in the family alan 
f kreisler director of counseling at susquehanna university said 
wednesday 
you cant overestimate how emotional that day is whether 
its your first child or your last child to head to college that 
day will have an enormous impact on your lives he said 
kreisler said family members should talk about what they expect 
from each other before the child goes to college 
all parents react differently but for most the emotional impact 
of the last or only child going to school is the greatest 
according to kreisler 
often parents are faced with a quiet home absent of the child 
or children who have been the focus of the parents lives for at 
least 18 years kreisler said 
the couple has to relearn to deal with each other he said 
many times the result is depression or bickering between the 
husband and wife until they reestablish their lives as a couple 
kreisler said 
parents should also expect big changes when the first child goes 
to college kreisler said 
all the relationships change all of a sudden no 2 kid is no 
1 so the attention he or she gets changes he said 
parents should resist being overly protective of children going 
to college kreisler advised you want the kid to develop into an 
independent person but you want to know the family is still 
there he said 
parents also should expect freshmanyear rebelliousness from 
their children kreisler said they need to plan how theyll react 
if a son comes home with a pierced ear or punk haircut or if a 
daughter announces shes signed up to live in a coed dormitory 
parents should be honest with a child but shouldnt try to stop 
a son or daughter from adapting a new lifestyle unless they 
consider it dangerous such as drug or alcohol abuse kreisler said

bakker made the comments in a sworn deposition as he prepared to 
defend himself against a 52 million lawsuit by ptl which charges 
he grossly mismanaged the tv ministry 
i have reason to dispute all records of ptl at this time 
because of hostile people who took over heritage usa bakker said 
in a july 18 deposition sworn answers to attorneys questions he 
also was deposed on july 22 
the charlotte observer said in a story in wednesdays editions 
it obtained the depositions which have not been filed court

taggart took millions of dollars from ptl for their personal use 
although they knew the ministry was in financial trouble bakker 
resigned following revelations of his tryst with former church 
secretary jessica hahn 
the ministry has been reorganizing under chapter 11 bankruptcy

the treasury department announced wednesday it 
will borrow 29 billion to replenish government coffers next week 
but for the first time in six years will not issue 30year bonds 
every three months the government holds three debt sales to 
finance the 25 trillion national debt it sells threeyear notes 
10year notes and 30year bonds 
charles o sethness assistant treasury secretary for domestic 
finance said the government will not issue 30year bonds this time 
because it has used practically all of its congressional authority 
to do so 
house and senate bills that include provisions freeing the 
treasury to issue longterm debt have passed committees in both 
chambers however the bills must pass both the full house and 
senate and any differences would have to be reconciled in 
negotiations between the two bodies 
we are hopeful the congress will act soon sethness said 
when bond authority legislation is enacted we expect to 
return to our regular schedule 
the auctions next week call for 
11 billion in threeyear notes in minimum denominations of 
5000 to be auctioned tuesday 
11 billion in 10year notes in minimum denominations of 1000 
to be auctioned wednesday 
7 billion in 248day cash management bills in minimum 
denominations of 1000 to be issued thursday 
the 22 billion in notes includes 148 billion to pay off 
maturing securities and 72 billion in new cash 
the note auctions are about in line with analysts expectations 
and represented a 4 billion reduction from the last quarterly 
auctions when 26 billion was raised 
sethness said the cash management bills will be repaid on april 
20 and are intended help smooth government revenue flows which 
normally surge in april as people pay their income taxes

the nations 13 largest airlines in june had 
their best record of ontime flights since the government began 
issuing reports on the carriers performance the department of 
transportation reported wednesday 
in its latest monthly report the department said 843 percent 
of the airlines flights that were tallied operated on schedule 
since the government began releasing the figures last september 
the best previous performance had been in april when 826 percent 
of the flights were reported to be on time 
the improvement came even as the airlines began their annual 
summertime crunch period a season when air traffic increases as 
people take vacations 
america west airlines had the best performance reporting that 
928 percent of flights operated on schedule southwest airlines 
was next best at 908 percent and american took third place with 
an 882 percent record 
at the other end of the spectrum pan american had the worst 
ontime percentage at 722 percent followed by us air with 766 
percent and trans world airlines with 79 percent 
the department considers a flight to be on time if it arrives at 
or departs from a gate within 15 minutes of schedule flights that 
are delayed for mechanical reasons are not counted because the 
officials who created the reporting system feared that otherwise 
they would penalize carriers that hold back planes that are having 
equipment problems 
the airlines are required to report their ontime performances 
at 27 of the countrys busiest airports although most carriers 
submit figures for more airfields than that at the required 
airports the 13 carriers overall ontime performance was 834 
percent 
in july the department logged 1964 complaints from passengers 
about us airlines up from the 1707 complaints received in june 
the total continued a trend in which complaints have dropped 
dramatically from a year ago dot received 6561 complaints in july 
1987 
as has been the case before continental airlines had the 
largest number of complaints per 100000 passengers flown 1154 
pan am had the second highest ratio of complaints at 1087 while 
eastern airlines was third with 905 
air wisconsin had the lowest ratio of complaints with 046 
southwest was next best with 098 while delta airlines was third 
lowest with 119 
it is believed that only a small number of passengers who have 
problems with flights bother to complain to the transportation 
department

former democratic presidential candidate jesse 
jackson said wednesday that george bush is not morally fit to 
be president because the likely republican nominee has failed to 
support civil rights legislation 
throughout 7 years of the most miserable civil rights record 
of any recent administration mr bush has chosen not to say a 
mumblin word jackson told a crowd of about 4000 at the 
national urban league convention 
mr bush opposed the civil rights restoration act anyone who 
opposed the civil rights restoration act is not morally fit to lead 
this nation 
jackson listed his 10 clear reasons why he supports 
democratic nominee michael dukakis over bush and urged those in 
attendance to vote democratic in november 
jackson cited dukakis support for civil rights child care 
education statehood for the district of columbia and total 
economic isolation of the apartheid south african government by the 
world community he also noted dukakis opposition to aid to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels and unreasonable defense spending 
like moses if we use our rod we can part the seas and move 
closer to canaan land jackson said but if we dont use our 
rod our vote and drop it it will turn into a snake and go to 
washington and bite us 
jackson said he agrees with dukakis view of government saying 
it is an instrument of public service on the other hand bush 
believes government is an instrument to enrich the few and starve 
the many he said 
the former democratic candidate said his unsuccessful bid for 
the presidential nomination was a victory victory is that the 
reasonable expectations of our leaders and our children have been 
raised he said 
the crowd stood and cheered as jackson shouted i may not get 
to the white house but our children will our children will our 
children will 
jackson wouldnt detail his plans for the future but told the 
crowd i dont want a job he said his job is taking their case 
before the people 
asked after the address to be more specific he told reporters 
unemployed people need a job i dont need a job

the soviet union opened this 
strategic black sea port to frank carlucci after the us defense 
secretary held what he described as constructive talks wednesday 
with president andrei a gromyko 
carlucci was the first us official to visit sevastopol 
headquarters of the soviet black sea fleet since president 
franklin d roosevelt did so in 1945 during his yalta summit with 
josef stalin and prime minister winston churchill of britain 
carlucci took a boat from yalta to sevastopol on the crimean 
peninsula after meeting with gromyko in massandra a small town 
four miles from yalta 
he told reporters his session with the 79yearold president 
who served nearly three decades as foreign minister was very 
constructive 
obviously we did not agree on all things but we found areas of 
agreement he said carlucci did not give details of the talks 
but said they touched on arms control 
tass the official news agency said gromyko identified 
elimination of nuclear arms as the current problem of problems 
and lamented slow progress in ussoviet talks on longrange 
weapons now under way in geneva 
peace will benefit from anything president reagan can do to 
breathe fresh energy into the talks during the last months of 
his administration he said and called for greater understanding 
and trust between the superpowers 
let us arrange things in such a way so that your arm is never 
lifted against us and ours against you tass quoted him as 
saying 
carlucci and his delegation were in the third day of an official 
visit to the soviet union during which close inspection has been 
allowed of some previously secret kremlin hardware and military 
bases 
he was greeted by a brass band and a naval honor guard then met 
with mikhail n khronopulo admiral of the fleet on thursday he 
is to board a soviet missile cruiser 
gromyko greeted carlucci in massandra at an opulent summer 
mansion stalin had used they shook hands in a woodpaneled room of 
the alexander mansion with a spectacular view of the black sea 
about 360 yards below 
the heavily guarded mansion was built by czar alexander iii and 
finished in 1902 but alexander never lived there it has been used 
in recent years to receive foreign dignitaries the last american 
to stay there was industrialist armand hammer in 1981 according to 
building supervisor nikolai i tupikov 
gromyko showed off the surroundings to carlucci asking have 
you seen the scenery as they sat down for discussions at the 
vacation site 
its beautiful here lovely here carlucci responded 
plantings of pink and red roses dotted the lush carefully 
manicured grounds with fountains and pine cedar pear and apricot 
trees 
inside the mansion carlucci and assistant secretary of defense 
ron lehman sat on red velvet chairs beneath a watercolor painting 
by c robert kammer of a crimean sunset 
they faced soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov and gromyko 
across a long wooden table in the second floor meeting room 
decorated with dutchmade porcelain floor tiles 
gromyko is in the crimea on vacation and has been staying at 
another summer residence about six miles away along the black sea 
coast he told carlucci that their meeting venue was used as a 
residence by stalin during the 1945 yalta conference 
the visiting us official arrived in the soviet union on monday 
and held a round of talks with yazov before addressing the 
voroshilov academy of the general staff 
on tuesday he visited the kubinka air force base and sat inside 
the cockpit of the topsecret blackjack bomber the first look 
ever allowed a western official then watched over soviet war games 
at the taman motorized rifle division base southwest of the capital

the government will demand abolishing a 
us air force base near athens used to monitor soviet fleet 
movements in the mediterranean sea an official said wednesday 
greek government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said the base 
will be dropped from a new operating agreement for american 
military installations in greece 
one of the decisions reached by the greek government is the 
abolition of hellenikon air base he said 
kostopoulos statement which caught western diplomats here by 
surprise conflicted with a background briefing given by a senior 
foreign ministry official on tuesday the official said hellenikon 
base might remain open 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the united states had not received formal notification of closure 
of hellenikon base and would not comment on it a spokeswoman for 
the us embassy in athens also refused to comment 
greek and american officials are negotiating a new us bases 
agreement to replace an existing fiveyear accord that expires at 
the end of december 
however the talks have faltered over greek efforts to link them 
with its longstanding disputes with turkey american officials have 
refused to connect the two issues 
kostopoulos also dismissed reports that hellenikon air base 
next to athens airport might be transferred to another location or 
simply merged with another american base on the southern aegean 
island of crete 
in no way does the abolition of this base mean a transfer to 
crete and specifically souda bay or any other location on the 
island he said 
the united states maintains a sixth fleet supply base in souda 
bay and an air force communications station in gournes also on 
crete 
hellenikon 10 miles from athens is a support base used by 
reconnaisance planes to monitor soviet fleet movements in the 
eastern mediterranean it is one of four us bases operating in 
greece since the early 1950s 
a us navy communications base is also located near athens in 
the town of nea makri about 20 miles from the city 
negotiations for a new agreement have been under way since 
november 1987 kostopoulos has said there has been no significant 
progress in eight rounds of talks and that there continued to be 
a difference of views 
as a form of rent for the bases greece receives more than 300 
million yearly in us military credits 
a new round of talks on the us bases is scheduled to start 
sept 9 
the greek government issued a formal shutdown notice on july 13 
for all us bases operating in greece but the legal formality 
does not necessarily mean that all the installations will close 
moreover if greek and american negotiators are unable to reach 
agreement the present accord gives the united states 17 months 
after its expiration to dismantle the bases 
socialist premier andreas papandreou insists that the united 
states should help solve greekturkish disputes over military 
control of the aegean sea and the divided island of cyprus in 
return for a new agreement 
kostopoulos said in his statement that any prospective agreement 
will have to serve greeces highest national interests the 
disputes with turkey are often referred to in that way 
the spokesman also advised american officials to take the 
greek governments positions into consideration before they make 
useless and untimely statements 
earlier this week kostopoulos rejected reported statements by 
us secretary of defense frank carlucci a turkish newspaper said 
carlucci vowed the united states would never give guarantees about 
a nato country to another member country of the military alliance 
both greece and turkey belong to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the report also quoted carlucci as saying that washington had 
already made this point to greece 
kostopoulos said that carluccis statements cast doubt on the 
value of the bases dialogue

the city and three councilmen paid 1600 
in contempt fines wednesday while the mayor warned that city 
workers could be laid off this month unless yonkers complies with a 
federal housing desegregation order 
us district judge leonard sand found the city and three 
council members in contempt tuesday for refusing to build 
lowincome housing units yonkers 100 fine will double daily and 
would wipe out the citys 337 million budget in 22 days 
with a majority on the council opposed to the order and 
unmoved so far by their own 500aday fines the city hoped to 
get a quick stay of the contempt finding 
state officials meanwhile considered a plan to seize control 
of the citys purse strings and remove members of the yonkers city 
council 
yonkers the states fourthlargest city with a population of 
just under 200000 has been in a legal tugofwar with sand since 
1985 when the judge found the city liable for intentionally 
segregating its housing and schools over a 40year period 
abutting new york city yonkers is 21 square miles of diversity 
ranging from rundown tenements to homes with lush lawns in 
neighborhoods proud of their scarsdale and bronxville zip codes 
some residents opposed to the desegregation plan have 
aggressively battled the council members were sent bullets in the 
mail when the council approved a consent decree in the case in 
january 
if you dont want to change your environment a judge 
shouldnt do it for you said vincent demarco a resident for 
all his 21 years we want to keep this place decent i dont know 
how the judge can say a vote isnt right 
allen cunningham moved here two years ago from brooklyn 
i dont think what he sand did was really right said 
cunningham who is black we can only look listen and learn it 
can help blacks who are trying to make a decent life my 3yearold 
son should have a decent place to play not some druginfested 
place but it may make matters worse between black and white 
a school integration program is entering its third year but 
city officials have refused to build 200 units of lowincome 
housing on the citys predominantly white east side and 800 units 
of low and moderateincome housing throughout the city 
on monday the city council voted 43 not to endorse a package 
of bonuses financial incentives and zoning variances to attract 
developers to build the 800 units three of the four council 
members voting in the majority were found in contempt a decision 
on the fourth is pending because he asked the court for time to get 
a lawyer 
yonkers counsel paul pickelle said a transcript of tuesdays 
contempt hearing and other documents on the citys request for a 
stay were sent to judge j daniel mahoney of the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals 
mayor nicholas wasiscko one of the three council members who 
voted for the housing plan warned that twoweek layoff notices 
would be sent to municipal workers friday but city manager neil 
deluca said he would wait at least a week before preparing what he 
calls a doomsday scenario for layoffs of the citys estimated 
1800 municipal workers 
i dont want to scare everyone deluca said come aug 16 
or aug 17 i will notify 70 to 80 percent of the nonessential 
work force that theyre laid off we wont get to police or 
firefighters until aug 22 
the city managers office has ordered city workers not to talk 
to reporters 
wasiscko said mondays defiance was the result of 
frustration over the issue he noted that yonkers has 6800 
units of lowincome housing while neighboring suburbs such as 
scarsdale have none 
deluca said he was hoping for action by the emergency financial 
control board the fiscal watchdog installed by the state after 
yonkers 1984 brush with bankruptcy 
the control board can take over the power of spending from the 
city council to implement the housing plan and can recommend 
council members removal from office the board planned to meet 
thursday 
sand urged gov mario cuomo who has the power to remove elected 
officials from office to step in and help resolve the crisis 
but cuomo spokesman gary fryer said at the moment there is 
no need for us to act

less than three weeks after assuming office in 
a hotly contested election new teamsters president william j 
mccarthy has fired two of the unions top regional officials along 
with its chief attorney 
teamster officials confirmed wednesday that mccarthy a day 
earler replaced robert holmes and edward lawson as directors of the 
unions central and canadian conferences 
both men who retain their elected seats on the unions 
18member policysetting executive board and titles as 
international vice presidents had supported secretarytreasurer 
weldon mathis for the top teamsters job after the death last month 
of jackie presser 
mathis who was pressers designated heir and had served as 
interim president while presser was undergoing brain surgery was 
defeated by mccarthy on a 98 vote by the teamsters executive 
board july 15 
at a board meeting tuesday mccarthy won approval on a 108 vote 
to replace holmes 76 of detroit as director of the unions 
13state 600000member central council with daniel c ligurotis 
of chicago 
ligurotis who started his teamster career 44 years ago as a 
truck drivers helper in chicago was elected to the unions 
executive board last summer 
he had voted for mccarthy in a successful bid by old guard east 
coast teamster leaders to deny the presidency to mathis who worked 
with presser in trying to attack the corruption stigma that has 
plagued the union for decades through gradual reforms and 
aggressive public and government relations 
holmes a confidant of the former teamster president james r 
hoffa since the early 1930s organizing wars in the midwest had 
favored calling a special convention of 2000 union delegates from 
around the country to pick a successor for presser 
lawson 57 of vancouver british columbia had been head of the 
unions 200000member canadian conference since its creation in 
1976 and has been a vice president and board member of the union 
since 1971 
mccarthy engineered his replacement by louis lacroix of 
montreal who has been head of the unions brewery and soft drinks 
division in canada since 1975 
lawson said wednesday he was very angry and added its 
not the kind of thing youd expect a trade union to do 
the new teamsters president also succeeded tuesday in elevating 
his top assistant at local 25 in boston which mccarthy also heads 
to the vacant seat left on the unions board by pressers death 
last month 
frank hackett 54 of sommerville mass a business agent in 
the boston local since 1973 was elected as the unions 16th vice 
president on a 98 vote with mathis loyalists opposing him 
immediately upon hacketts election mccarthy then won 108 
votes from the board approving his ouster of holmes and lawson 
according to sources in the union who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
officials at the teamsters headquarters here would not comment 
on details of the continuing power struggle within the unions 
heirarchy 
but spokesman duke zeller said the conference chairmen unlike 
elected board members serve at the will of the unions president 
he has the right under the unions constitution to select who 
serves under him zeller said of mccarthy this is not unusual 
its been done i think with every change in the presidency 
last week mccarthy fired cleveland attorney and presser 
loyalist john r climaco as the unions general counsel and 
replaced him with james t grady 
climaco had been in charged of preparing the unions defense to 
a civil suit filed by the justice department in may to replace its 
entire executive board which the government contends is under the 
control of mob figures with a courtappointed trustee 
he also was pressers chief defense lawyer on a criminal 
embezzlement and racketeering case that never went to trial because 
of the former teamster presidents long illness 
meanwhile zeller said the union will reopen talks next week in 
washington with the car haulers industry a new proposed threeyear 
contract covering some 20000 teamsters who work for automobile 
transporters was rejected by 31 vote last month 
zeller said 12member negotiating committees for the two sides 
are scheduled to meet next thursday for the first time since the 
contracts rejection

a federal appeals court wednesday upheld the 
payment of federal campaign funds to democrat michael dukakis 
presidential campaign even though running mate lloyd bentsen is 
also seeking reelection to the senate 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
rejected a challenge to the federal election commission action 
releasing 46 million in federal funding due the dukakisbentsen 
ticket 
bentsens senate campaign opponent republican rep beau 
boulter and the national republican senatorial committee which 
helps gop senate candidates win election asked the court to block 
the democrats from spending the money saying the dual campaign 
gave bentsen an unfair financial advantage 
the fec however said the republicans failed to show that there 
is anything illegal about bentsens decision to run for both the 
vice presidency and reelection to his senate seat as allowed 
under texas law 
because of the dual campaign bentsen would be able to spend the 
4 million in private money raised for his senate contest on top of 
the federal money for his vice presidential campaign which is 
limited for both parties 
blocking the democrats from spending their federal money would 
irreparably harm their campaign the fec said 
the committee asked the fec to withhold the 46 million in 
federal funding due the dukakisbentsen ticket but the commission 
two weeks ago voted 60 to reject that request the money was then 
transferred from the treasury to the campaign 
the threejudge panel rejected the republican groups contention 
that the fecs action was arbitrary and capricious 
we conclude that petitioners allegations are insufficient on 
their face to warrant a revocation of the certification of 
payment of money to the dukakisbentsen campaign the court said 
the brief order was issued by circuit judges spotswood robinson 
laurence silberman and douglas ginsburg

the federal government would pay home and 
nursing home costs for elderly people unable to care for for 
themselves under legislation introduced wednesday by sen edward m 
kennedy 
kennedy dmass said his proposal would cost 20 billion a 
year when fully implemented and emphasized that there are a variety 
of ways to pay for such a new program with new taxes 
the key condition that we all know must be met is that this 
program must be selffinancing he said at a hearing of the labor 
and human resources committee he chairs deficit increases are as 
unacceptable as inaction and i am confident that the american 
people and the congress will find a way to pay for the kind of 
program that our senior citizens and their families need and 
deserve 
the catastrophic health expansion of the medicare program signed 
into law this summer by president reagan made only marginal 
improvements in nursing home care for people recovering from acute 
illnesses and longterm care is widely regarded as the major 
health issue of 1989 
several other legislators including sen george mitchell 
dmaine and rep henry waxman dcalif are actively working on 
their own versions of longterm care legislation 
kennedy enlisted rep claude pepper dfla the 87yearold 
dean of the house of representatives to help kick off the push for 
his bill 
pepper had proposed legislation this year to expand home health 
care for elderly and disabled people but it did not make 
provisions for expanded nursing home care 
while the legislation leaves open the method of financing 
kennedy said he personally favors increasing the current income 
ceiling on the social security payroll tax for both employees and 
employers to raise most of the money for the new program 
he also mentioned higher inheritance alcohol and tobacco taxes 
as other possibilities

a newborn girl who had two fingers 
reattached by microsurgery after they were severed during her 
delivery by caesarean section has left the hospital 
twelvedayold kristen meckle left north memorial medical center 
with her mother diane on tuesday to fly home to wildrose nd 
they will return to minneapolis in two weeks to have the cast on 
kristens left hand removed 
the infant was rushed by plane to north memorial from trinity 
medical center in minot nd after a surgeon accidentally severed 
most of her index finger including two joints and part of the 
middle finger including one joint with a surgical stapler during 
delivery 
during five hours of surgery a team working under a surgical 
microscope used tiny wires to reconnect the bones stitched 
together seven severed blood vessels reattached five tendons and 
some nerves and finally sewed the outer skin closed 
the fingers are healing very well and circulation is 
excellent said surgeon martin adson so these fingers that are 
so important in picking up things almost certainly will survive 
now he added but he said only time will tell how much stiffness 
might remain 
in general children do better than adults with this type of 
surgery so we are hoping a newborn will do even better he said 
finger loss or other serious injuries during caesarean section 
delivery are extremely rare said theresa malone a spokeswoman 
for the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists in 
washington dc however she said no records are kept on the 
number 
mrs meckle said she harbors no ill feelings for what happened 
during the delivery it was just an unfortunate accident she 
said 
she declined to name the doctor involved but said id go 
back to him anytime her insurance is covering the cost of the 
medical care and the minot hospital is picking up the cost of 
travel and other expenses she said

the chicago amp north western transportatio co 
said it planned to adopt new work rules triggering a rail strike at 
midnight wednesday but congress appeared ready to end the walkout 
quickly 
the united transportation union said it would strike at 1201 
am thursday if campnw cuts the size of most of its train crews from 
four to two a move that would eliminate the jobs of 1156 brakemen 
the railroad which moves freight on 6400 miles of track in 10 
midwestern states said the walkout would disrupt at least some of 
its freight operations and leave 40000 chicagoarea commuters 
without rail service 
the senate adopted a resolution tuesday calling for a 36day 
extension of a coolingoff period in the rail dispute but the 
house was not expected to consider the resolution until thursday 
morning 
mike bushman an aide to rep terry bruce dill a sponsor of 
the extension said the house delayed action because of objections 
by rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee 
bushman said dingell had concerns about whether congressional 
action would be constitutional before a strike began 
but as it stands we dont exect a strike to last long 
bushman said hopefully they will have legislation passed and 
signed by the president in time to have commuter trains rolling for 
the afternoon rush hour 
labor and management said they would honor any congressional 
order 
if congress takes action certainly we would abide by it 
said donald markgraf the unions general chairman for campnw 
employees from his office at wauwatosa wis 
markgraf said the union will strike on schedule and expects 
other unions to honor utu picket lines 
until the house takes action we have to go on the assumption 
that were going to implement our work rules and there will be a 
strike spokeswoman leslie cleveland said from campnw headquarters 
in chicago 
were going to try to run the railroad as efficiently as we 
can ms cleveland said hopefully it wont hurt traffic 
especially if its a very shortlived strike 
if congress were to act tomorrow it would only last a day 
she said but you cant really say what will happen so we just 
have to go ahead with our plans 
in april president reagan issued an executive order barring 
either side from taking action until 30 days after a presidential 
emergency board submitted recommendations for a settlement 
the coolingoff period expires at 1201 am thursday but the 
senate voted tuesday to extend it until sept 9 to give the company 
and the union more time to reach an agreement 
the presidential board recommended last month that campnw cut one 
brakeman per train and that elimination of the second should be 
decided through binding arbitration on a trainbytrain basis 
campnw initially rejected the proposal but offered monday to 
accept it 
we felt congress would probably implement the proposal 
anyway and this would avoid a strike ms cleveland said but 
the union doesnt want to accept this doesnt want to go halfway 
so were prepared for the strike 
she said the company would implement its original layoff plans 
rather than follow the compromise proposed by the emergency board 
james foote a spokesman for the railroads parent company cnw 
corp said the railroads commuter trains would not run thursday 
in the event of a strike 
but he said management personel would be used to operate enough 
freight trains to generate 80 percent of the companys usual 
freighthauling revenues on the first day of a strike

the federal government said wednesday it has 
reached a 331 million settlement with 48 companies over illegally 
dumped waste at four new england sites the agreement includes the 
largest cost recovery ever won under the superfund law 
the settlement the culmination of a nineyear joint state and 
federal investigation was disclosed in a civil complaint filed 
wednesday by the environmental protection agency seeking damages 
from 25 other companies that did not cooperate with authorities 
were sending a message that says if you illegally dispose of 
illegal waste youre going to get found youre going to get 
caught and youll have to pay for it said daniel s greenbaum 
commissioner of the state department of environmental quality 
engineering 
the settlement is described technically as a proposal 
because federal law requires a 30day public comment period though 
the parties involved have already agreed to the conditions 
the settlement involves major companies who were customers of 
cannons engineering corp and the cleanup of cannon hazardous 
waste sites in bridgewater and plymouth mass and nashua and 
londonderry nh it includes the recovery of 17 million in 
cleanup costs spent by the government at the sites the largest 
recovery amount in superfund history 
although cannons conducted the illegal dumping without notifying 
its customers officials said superfund law holds that all parties 
connected with illegal dumping of hazardous waste are liable for 
cleanup costs 
cannons which has gone out of business is one of the companies 
that has refused to settle with federal officials and is named in 
the us district court complaint 
the settling parties also agreed to finish cleaning up three of 
the four sites work estimated to cost 161 million 
the epa previously reached 146 million in settlements with 
companies responsible for smaller amounts of waste dumping at the 
sites 
this should slam dunk them illegal dumpers to the fullest 
extent of the law said epa regional administrator michael 
deland were saying we cant tolerate this anymore 
in washington dc assistant attorney general roger j 
marzulla of the justice departments land and natural resources 
division said the four sites involved some of the most urgent 
hazardous waste problems in new england and the government took 
decisive action 
the illegal dumping stemmed from problems that began shortly 
after cannons bought property in bridgewater in 1974 to handle 
store and incinerate chemical waste 
a few years later cannons began taking in more waste than it 
could handle in bridgewater and began illegally shipping the 
overflow to the three other sites in plymouth and new hampshire 
however cannons officials reported to authorities that the excess 
waste was actually being incinerated at bridgewater 
according to epa spokesman michael thomas the surplus waste was 
moved stealthily out of the bridgewater site after dark and taken 
to nashua where it was dumped in the ground near a stream 
officials first discovered the problem in 1979 when groundwater 
contamination became so severe that emissions were noticeable in 
the air rising from the stream 
the dumping of waste in londonderry was discovered when 
residents notified environmental authorities of a peculiar 
frothing at a stream residential drinking water supplies were 
threatened and had to be replaced at both sites 
the waste in plymouth was contained in storage tanks that began 
leaking thomas said 
in 1980 state officials revoked cannons hazardous waste 
license because of alleged reporting and hazardous waste 
violations five people associated with cannons including j scott 
cannon one of the owners served brief terms in state prison 
thomas said 
among the companies included in the settlement announced 
wednesday were globe newspaper co polaroid corp monsanto co 
clean harbors of braintree and natick atlantic richfield co and 
the general electric co 
epa officials said they have spent 30 million so far in initial 
cleanup of the sites and described them all as stabilized the 
money recovered by the epa will cover those costs and go toward 
finishing the cleanup

the kremlin accused pakistan of international 
terrorism in afghanistan and made a veiled threat wednesday of 
soviet response 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze made the comments to 
pakistans foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan who arrived 
tuesday on a visit that centers on the afghan situation the 
official news agency tass reported 
soviet officials accuse pakistan of violating provisions of a 
unmediated agreement that commits the red army to withdraw from 
afghanistan by next feb 15 it also contains a pledge by pakistan 
and afghanistan not to interfere in each others internal affairs 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a 
communist coup in april 1978 and soviet soldiers entered the 
country in december 1979 
an estimated 115000 soviet troops were in afghanistan when the 
withdrawal agreement was signed april 14 in geneva and about 35000 
are said to have been withdrawn under the terms half of the force 
is to be out by aug 15 
pakistan afghanistans eastern neighbor is involved because at 
least 3 million afghan refugees live in cities and camps just 
inside its territory that serve as bases and supply points for 
guerrillas 
shevardnadze told yaqub the pakistanis had grossly and openly 
violated the agreement tass said he cited unceasing massive 
dispatches of arms to afghan guerrillas through pakistani 
territory and the existence of a rival afghan government on 
pakistani soil 
the soviet foreign minister accused pakistan of hampering in 
every way the return to afghanistan of refugees living in 
pakistan and said rebels had increased attacks on afghan towns 
killing or wounding hundreds of civilians in the past two months 
islamabads support for such actions cannot be described other 
than as international terrorism he told yaqub we would wish 
that they in islamabad become clearly aware that this cannot go on 
indefinitely 
if the alleged violations continue the soviet union and the 
republic of afghanistan will find with what to counter the growing 
interference in the internal affairs of the republic of 
afghanistan shevardnadze said 
he did say what action might be taken tass did not say if yaqub 
had any reply 
the head of the soviet army contingent said in a published 
interview pakistani violations might force the red army to 
reconsider the withdrawal timetable

the worlds anglican bishops on 
wednesday passed a resolution calling for south africas withdrawal 
from southwest africa 
also wednesday a report to the bishops urged christians to 
develop closer links with jews to prevent another nazi holocaust 
the resolution on south africa adopted at the bishops 
conference in lambeth came a day after south africa proposed an 
aug 10 ceasefire in the angolan war the truce would lead to 
withdrawal of foreign troops and independence for south 
africanadministered southwest africa also known as namibia 
the bishops resolution was proposed by the bishop of stepney 
jim thompson in the name of the 70 million members of the anglican 
church 
the archbishop of canterbury dr robert runcie is to send the 
message of support to the geneva peace talks 
thompson claimed south african troops in namibia were fighting 
close to schools involving children in the crossfire 
young people have been kidnapped or seduced into joining 
armies attacks on the church have brought a severe crisis he 
said 
bishop david russell of grahamstown in south africa seconded 
the resolution and called on the conference to urge western 
governments to monitor peace in namibia 
the report calling for improved judeochristian relations 
stemmed from a proposal by bishop of oxford richard harries to 
broaden dialogue among the anglican community jews and moslems 
the proposal said the three religions have much in common and 
should work together to promote human rights and prevent prejudice 
leading to tragedies like the world war ii holocaust when six 
million jews were killed 
in order to combat centuries of antijewish teaching 
christians must develop programs of teaching preaching and common 
social action which eradicate prejudice the report said 
the holocaust had seeds in centuries of antijewish prejudice 
promulgated by leaders church and state in which the evil weed 
of nazism was able to take root the report said

the house on wednesday overwhelmingly approved 
legislation to extend federal aid for the homeless for two years 
the bill passed 33380 authorizes 6425 million for the 1989 
fiscal year which begins oct 1 and such sums as may be 
necessary for fiscal 1990 
the measure reauthorizes the stewart b mckinney homeless 
assistance act enacted last year for emergency shelter and food 
health care education and job training the law is named for a 
late republican congressman from connecticut 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said before the vote the 
homeless initiatives passed by congress last year are working but 
far more needs to be done 
while many homeless citizens are being helped the total 
homeless population continues to increase at an annual rate of 20 
percent in major urban areas he said two out of three cities 
have to deny services to homeless applicants because of a lack of 
public resources 
wright said homelessness unlike other afflictions can be cured 
we have located the cause of this condition in the large cuts 
that were made in lowincome housing and mental health services 
he said and we have found the remedy in the programs for 
affordable housing health care and edcuation programs contained in 
homeless assistance acts 
the house approved the measure after defeating 215203 an 
amendment introduced by reps marge roukema rnj and thomas j 
ridge rpa that would have combined all the funds for housing 
and shelter programs into a single block grant effective in the 
second year of the authorization 
similar legislation is pending in the senate

hurricane fabio packing 155 mph wind gusts was 
labeled a potential threat to hawaii wednesday but forecasters said 
it was too soon to tell whether the storm would reach the island 
chain 
at 8 am wednesday 2 pm edt the storm was 900 miles 
eastsoutheast of honolulu moving west at 15 mph said clarence 
lee a national weather service forecaster in honolulu 
hurricane fabio continues to be a very potent and dangerous 
hurricane and is considered to be a potential threat to the 
hawaiian islands lee said 
fabios maximum sustained winds were estimated near 125 mph with 
hurricane force winds of at least 74 mph extending out 75 miles 
from the center tropical storm strength winds 39 mph to 73 mph 
extended out 180 miles from the center 
this is one of the strongest hurricanes in the area in quite a 
while said hans rosendal a weather service meteorogist 
the storm was expected to continue on its current course for the 
next 24 hours with little change in strength lee said 
the last major storm to hit hawaii was hurricane iwa which 
brushed the island of oahu and roared over kauai and niihau islands 
with winds up to 117 mph in november 1982 causing 234 million 
damage 
if fabio stays on course lee said the national weather service 
would consider issuing hurricane watches or warnings later 
wednesday 
the center of the storm would pass 50 miles south of hawaii the 
southernmost island in the chain on friday if the storm maintains 
its heading and speed rosendal said 
officials expect to have an updated satellite reading of the 
hurricanes position around 4 pm wednesday 10 pm edt 
while the storm was still hundreds of miles away the islands 
were expected to begin feeling its effects surf as high as 15 feet 
was expected on the southeast shore of hawaii island and 
largerthannormal waves were forecast for all hawaiian islands

the prosecutor in the irancontra case asked 
the judge wednesday to order oliver l north to get more specific 
about what government secrets he wants to disclose at his trial or 
bar the exwhite house aide from revealing any classified 
information 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said the 265page notice 
that north had filed monday under the classified information 
procedures act flouted both the law and an order issued earlier by 
us district court judge gerhard a gesell 
this telephone booksize submission is merely the latest move 
in the defendants struggle to have this trial postponed and to 
subvert the procedures of this court walsh said in a brief filed 
in us district court 
walsh said the notice merely recites an inventory of 
virtually all of the hundreds of thousands of classified documents 
the defendant has received in discovery 
walsh contended that the classified information statute requires 
a specific notice of the exact nature of top secret information the 
defendant intends to introduce at trial 
the law was enacted by congress to prevent defendants in 
criminal cases from scuttling the prosecution by threatening to 
disclose unspecified government secrets at trial 
walsh said the vague nature of norths filing was tantamount to 
the socalled graymail that the law was intended to prevent 
north has failed to describe even one piece of classified 
information that he expects to disclose in trial walsh said 
the index reveals no more than an obvious fact that the court and 
the government already knew many of the documents produced in 
discovery contain classified information 
north a former national security council aide is charged with 
conspiring with former national security advisor john m 
poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim and retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord to illegally divert usiran arms sales 
profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
gesell has already ruled that north should be allowed to examine 
vast quantities of classified documents to try to show he was 
acting with permission of higher officials in the reagan 
administration 
the problems posed by the classified documents prompted walsh on 
tuesday to suggest holding two trials for north the prosecutor 
suggested deferring action on the central conspiracy charges while 
efforts are made to devise procedures for disclosing classified 
information in court 
walsh suggested that gesell proceed to try north on 13 other 
charges of making false statements to congress obstructing justice 
and illegally enriching himself 
the north trial is set to begin sept 20 but gesell is 
considering a defense motion to postpone it until after the 
presidential election campaign 
separate trials have already been ordered for his codefendants

irans delegation to un peace talks said 
wednesday that the reported findings of human error in the downing 
of an iranian airliner prove irans contentions and called again 
for a us apology and reparations 
this report has proved what we have said until now and so 
we believe the united states has full responsibility in this 
connection iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati told 
reporters in answer to a question 
also on wednesday velayati lodged a formal protest with the 
security council over iraqs latest alleged use of chemical warfare 
and said the council should impose sanctions against the baghdad 
government 
velayati met security council president li luye of china for 
more than an hour on the issue 
reporters asked velayati about reports that un peace talks 
with iran and iraq were deadlocked 
no comment he said but added that secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar has not said a stalemate existed in efforts to end 
the 8yearold war 
iraq demands immediate facetoface talks with iran before a 
truce iran is resisting and the un chief is seeking a compromise 
the us envoy to the united nations ambassador vernon a 
walters told a news conference wednesday that perez de cuellar was 
concentrating on obtaining iraqs agreement before declaring a 
ceasefire 
iraq says it wont stop shooting if the secretarygeneral 
declares a truce without its consent 
in the airliner disaster the united states says the warship 
vincennes shot down an iranian airbus on july 3 killing all 290 
people aboard because the crew mistakenly believed it to be a 
hostile iranian f14 warplane 
but a navy investigation as reported by abc and the new york 
times found that the crew misinterpreted correct data from the 
ships sophisticated detection system and believed they were about 
to be attacked 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati would not say 
wednesday if he thought the airliners destruction was 
premeditated as iran charged earlier 
those people reponsible for reading instruments should have 
had sufficient training otherwise we wonder why they were put 
before that aegis system of radar and identification he said 
the findings once again prove that what we said from the 
very beginning was actually what happened said mohammad javad 
zarif counselor at the iranian mission and delegation spokesman 
he said the reported findings prove there could be no mistake 
with regard to the nature of the plane the fact that it was 
ascending rather than descending that it was flying at a 
prescribed altitude within assigned corridors 
all claims have come true and now it is time for the united 
states to act responsibly he said 
zarif speaking by telephone said the united states should pay 
reparations and issue a clear apology for the murder of 290 
innocent people 
he said the united states also should remove the source of 
tension referring to the presence of us warships in the persian 
gulf 
the united states already has expressed deep regret and said it 
was willing to pay compensation to victims families but not to 
the tehran government it said iran must share responsibility 
because it let a civilian airliner fly in a war zone 
velayati told reporters outside un headquarters wednesday that 
he requested that a un expert team investigate the alleged 
chemical attack by iraq in which 1000 people were hurt with the 
outlawed weapons in northern ajerbaijan 
on monday a report by a un expert team concluded that iraq has 
made repeated and extensive use of chemical warfare in violation of 
international law 
it also found that nine iraqi soldiers were poisoned recently by 
chemical weapons but left open the question of whether iran was to 
blame

four congressmen who collected speechmaking 
fees from a rice broker linked to the koreagate scandal are not too 
busy now to testify in a civil suit against the businessman a 
judge ruled wednesday 
us district judge royce lamberth rejected arguments that 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif reps bill alexander dark 
and vic fazio calif and sen john breaux dla couldnt take 
time out of their busy schedules to be questioned in pretrial 
depositions in an antitrust suit against connell rice and sugar co 
and its president grover connell 
lamberth sided with lawyers for california rice growers suing 
connell rice and two california rice mill cooperatives the lawyers 
cited thousands of dollars that the four democrats made in 
honoraria for giving seminars at the companys headquarters in 
westfield nj in the early 1980s 
they were not so busy in their legislative duties that they 
were not able to take these trips lamberth said at the 
conclusion of a hearing on the issue 
steven ross counsel to the house clerk argued that lengthy 
depositions would take the four lawmakers away from important 
legislative business ross suggested that the plaintiffs could 
submit questions in writing to the congressmen rather than tie the 
lawmakers up in the depositions 
requiring these members to attend depositions for several 
hours or a better part of a day or more is very intrusive into 
their official functions ross said 
but lamberth ruled that an oral deposition rather than the 
submission of written interrogatories would be a more useful way 
to question the lawmakers the plaintiffs agreed to limit the 
depositions to four hours for each congressman 
among other things the plaintiffs want to question breaux about 
his relationship with tongsun park a south korean rice dealer who 
was the central figure of the koreagate bribery scandal of the late 
1970s 
howard langer the plaintiffs attorney said he wants to 
question breaux and other lawmakers about efforts they made to 
persuade the south korean government to purchase more us rice and 
to buy it from connell rice 
the judge expressed agreement with langers prediction that the 
congressmen would be hostile witnesses 
although there is no allegation the four acted improperly 
langer said the questioning is needed to develop evidence these 
congressmen were utilized in the overall scheme to influence the 
korean government to purchase rice at certain prices 
the lawsuit contends that connell rice conspired with the two 
cooperatives the rice growers association of california and the 
farmers rice cooperative to drive competitors out of business by 
lowering the price of rice 
connell was indicted but never convicted in the koreagate 
scandal on wire fraud racketeering and conspiracy charges he was 
also charged with concealing from the government that park was a 
korean government agent and not a legitimate rice dealer all the 
charges against connell were subsequently dismissed 
the civil suit contends bribes that connell rice paid to park 
were part of the antitrust scheme 
langer presented evidence in court papers that the congressmen 
received honoraria and campaign contributions from connell rice 
alexander received 7000 for attending four company seminars 
between 1981 and 1985 breaux then a house member was also paid 
7000 plus expenses for making four trips to the seminars during 
the same period coelho was paid 3000 for two trips and fazio 
received 5000 for three trips according to court papers 
park who said he distributed 850000 worth of bribes was 
given immunity from prosecution for his cooperation in the 
investigation which resulted in the conviction of one congressman

before the bus accident that left 27 
people dead of smoke inhalation federal safety officials were 
confident that riders would have enough time to escape a burning 
bus before it was engulfed by flames a top official testified 
wednesday 
up until may 14 of this year we were patting ourselves on the 
back for the good job we had done said ralph hitchcock director 
of the office of vehicle safety standards for the national highway 
traffic safety administration now were reviewing all of our 
standards for bus safety 
twentyseven people died that night when a school bus owned by 
the first assembly of god church in radcliff burst into flames upon 
impact with a pickup truck on interstate 71 near carrollton all 
survived the crash but couldnt escape the smoke 
the pickup truck driver larry mahoney 35 of worthville has 
pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder as well as other charges 
including drunken driving 
we believed that there were sufficient exits to allow the 
people to get out in a reasonable amount of time and up until this 
crash i dont think weve had any indication that that was not 
so hitchcock said 
hitchcocks testimony came on the second day of national 
transportation safety board hearings on the fatal crash in other 
testimony a consultant for ford motor co which built the bus 
chassis said a cage around the bus fuel tank may not have 
prevented the fire 
hitchcock said results of bus interiorflammability tests had 
indicated passengers on a school bus would have enough time to get 
out of a bus before it burned 
we had never had an occurrence where anyone was unable to get 
out on a timely basis because of flammability problems he said 
there were some close calls but they were able to get off 
hitchcock testified that it usually takes 1 minutes to evacuate 
a bus and four to five minutes for a bus to become engulfed in 
flames however in the carrollton accident flames blocked the 
front door leaving a rear emergency exit as the only door 
were talking about millionstoone probability that all of 
the factors are going to add up here to cause a problem he said 
we dont design our requirements to prevent oneofakind 
accidents 
john habberstad a consulting engineer specializing in accident 
reconstruction testified that a cage around the fuel tank may not 
have stopped the fire the bus was built shortly before new 
regulations requiring such a cage went into effect 
the tank was punctured by a piece of the bus spring assembly 
that broke off shortly after impact he said 
it wasnt until some 50 feet down the road from impact that 
a freeflying projectile the spring assembly penetrated the 
tank habberstad said the tank guard is not designed to 
prevent penetration by an object such as this its meant to 
protect intrusion from something like the pickup 
the ntsbs hearings end thursday the board will report on the 
crashs probable causes and recommend how to avoid similar 
accidents but it has no power to require implementation

george bush said wednesday that he will 
keep republican national committee chairman frank fahrenkopf on as 
party chairman even though his campaign is moving toward greater 
control of the party structure for the general election 
the vice president however said his convention manager fred 
v malek would have an expanded role in the committee and would be 
designated deputy rnc chairman 
i think theyll function as a very good team bush said 
after touring a westinghouse plant that manufactures and tests 
underwater electronic systems for the defense department 
bush indicated that he had spurned fahrenkopfs offer to resign 
because of the change at the top at the same time he said i 
think malek going up there will maximize coordination between the 
campaign and the important functions of the rnc 
meanwhile lee atwater bushs campaign manager denied that a 
palace revolt was under way in the party theres total 
confidence in frank fahrenkopf he offered to resign the vice 
president didnt want him to atwater told a news conference in 
washington 
malek a top executive of the marriott corp has been serving 
as bushs convention manager since last march he was a former 
white house aide in the nixon administration and developed a 
controversial plan known as the responsiveness program to 
marshal federal resources and personnel to help reelect nixon 
malek who appeared with atwater at the news conference 
described his role at the rnc as being one of a partnership with 
fahrenkopf who has been the party chairman since 1983 rather 
than an adversarial one 
i think you have a situation where one plus one can equal 
three thats the point of this whole thing malek said 
atwater meanwhile said that bush planned to arrive in new 
orleans for the republican national convention on aug 16 the 
second day of the event and after president reagan who speaks on 
the first night leaves 
he said he saw nothing unusual in the fact that reagan and bush 
would not be together during the convention that will formally 
install reagans 1980 and 1984 running mate as the gop nominee 
ive been to the last two conventions with ronald reagan and 
he never stays at conventions long atwater said 
bush toured an assembly room at the westinghouse oceanics 
division plant where sonar equipment for minedetectors is 
developed he also ate lunch with workers in the plant cafeteria 
where he used the occasion to praise president reagans veto 
earlier in the day of a defenseauthorization bill 
that is good national security policy bush said if we 
start cutting our advanced technological edge as that bill did it 
would not be good for our national security and not good for the 
strength of the nato alliance 
bush sidestepped questions on the health of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis as well as reagans reference 
to dukakis as an invalid the president later said i was 
trying to be funny and it didnt work 
bush said he was not going to be drawn into this 
minicontroversy a remark that drew applause from westinghouse 
employees in the cafeteria 
if somebody has a question i will try to answer it frankly i 
do find some of the inquiries intrusive but i will be glad to 
respond to questions as it relates to my health he said 
later at a white house meeting with a womens group bush said 
he would release his medical records i believe i responded in 
1980 about my medical background and im prepared to do it again 
he said 
on another subject bush put some distance between himself and 
reagan on recommendations from a presidential commission on aids 
indicating support for the centerpiece of the commissions report 
legislation banning discrimination against victims of the disease 
basically i support the objectives of the commission bush 
said we have a national health problem people are scared we 
need education we need testing we need research we need all of 
these things and i dont want to see some child who is an 
innocent victim of this outrageous horrible disease be 
discriminated against i just dont want to see that 
reagan on wednesday told federal agencies to adopt guidelines 
preventing such discrimination but stopped short of advocating 
stronger measures 
later in a statement issued by the white house bush said he 
endorses proposals to speed the availability of new drugs for aids 
and other lifethreatening diseases 
bush said the food and drug administration when considering 
whether to license new drugs for serious diseases should give 
greater weight to the risks the illnesses pose to life 
bush who heads a presidential task force on regulatory relief 
also announced that the fda is relaxing control over an 
experimental drug pentostatin used to treat leukemia that does 
not respond to other drugs or surgery 
fda spokeswoman faye petersen said pentostatin is the sixth drug 
to qualify for what is known as treatment ind status since the 
new category just short of fullmarket approval was established 
about a year ago 
she said pentostatin distribution will be handled through the 
national cancer institute and that officials estimate 60 to 100 
people nationwide might benefit from the new treatment

president reagan called michael dukakis an invalid 
wednesday then said hed just been trying to be funny but failed 
the democratic presidential nominee later released a summary of his 
medical history and said im a very healthy guy 
as the delicate subject of candidate health and in particular 
mental health arose in washington george bush on a short 
campaign trip stressed his support for star wars the proposed 
spacebased missile defense system dukakis termed the program a 
fantasy and repeated his longstanding opposition 
bush said he wanted no part of this minicontroversy 
surrounding the health of his opponent for the white house the 
vice president who will formally win the republican presidential 
nomination at this months party convention said he released 
relevant records of his own medical past in 1980 and would do 
so this year 
dukakis a devotee of powerwalking fastpaced walking while 
holding weights in each hand said no apology was needed for 
reagans comment and the president didnt offer one 
i was just trying to be funny and it didnt work he told 
reporters 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen said the 
presidents remark was outrageous and laughable at the same 
time 
 
 
 
 
 
kitty dukakis the candidates wife said during a visit to new 
jersey that such remarks come when people are desperate and 
afraid of dealing with the real issues 
there is no truth to any of those rumors mrs dukakis told 
reporters my husband has never seen a psychiatrist 
 
 
bush campaigning in annapolis md said reagans veto of the 
2995 billion defense bill was good national security policy 
weve got to keep this country strong and if we start cutting our 
advanced technological edge as that bill did it would not be good 
for our national security and not good for the strength of the 
alliance 
dukakis working in boston urged congress to override the veto 
this is a bipartisan defense authorization bill a bill which 
will strengthen our national security he said 
bush toured a defense installation in annapolis and paused long 
enough to field questions on a variety of subjects he said he 
would dispatch fred malek to the republican national committee as 
deputy chairman the vice president said that despite the move i 
have a lot of confidence in the current republican chairman 
frank fahrenkopf 
bush shed little light on his search for a vice presidential 
running mate telling reporters he hoped to make his decision 
before going to new orleans on aug 16 his aides have said they 
expect no public announcement until thursday aug 18 the final 
day of the convention 
in a related political matter sen phil gramm of texas said he 
would make the nominating speech for bush in new orleans 
publicly dukakis and his aides responded mildly to the 
emergence of the questions about his health and particularly his 
mental health 
we all occasionally misspeak and i dont think the president 
needed to apologize said dukakis he responded no when asked 
whether he had ever suffered from depression or consulted a 
psychiatrist 
rumors concerning dukakis mental health have swirled just below 
the surface of the campaign in recent days and they cropped up at 
the white house when reagan was asked a question by a reporter 
representing a publication backed by political extremist lyndon 
larouche 
reagan was asked whether he thought dukakis should make his 
records public and he replied look im not going to pick on an 
invalid 
an invalid in what sense he was asked 
i cant take any further questions the president said 
but a short time later he returned to the subject in another 
brief encounter with reporters 
i attempted a joke in response to a question and i think i 
was kidding but i dont think i should have said what i did 
reagan said still he said the public does have a right to know the 
medical history of a president 
late wednesday dukakis physician dr gerald r plotkin 
released a statement saying the candidate is in good health and 
has had no psychological symptoms complaints or treatment 
plotkin said at a news conference that dukakis after his 
brothers death and after his political defeat in 1978 showed a 
normal grief reaction but he added he generally is very 
strong in these situations 
he said the only surgery dukakis has undergone was in 1936 when 
he had his tonsils out as a child since 1971 the doctor reported 
dukakis has suffered a variety of aches and pains including a 
pulled achilles tendon and other ailments often experienced by 
runners hoarseness while he was a lecturer at harvard and a cyst 
on his back successfully drained 
the only prescription medicines he has taken during that period 
have been antihistamines for hay fever and naproxin a pain killer 
for muscular sprains and aches 
bush spokesman stephen hart said the vice president replied to a 
medical questionnaire by the detroit news on july 22 by saying that 
his physician describes his health as excellent and vigorous 
as for health difficulties bush told the paper i have mild 
arthritis in the hips which is nonlimiting i have cut back my 
running to two miles at a time mild symptons are readily 
controlled i am also allergic to bee stings for which i have 
received shots that are highly effective

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis is 
in excellent health has only received treatment for routine 
ailments and has had no psychological symptoms complaints or 
treatment his longtime doctor said wednesday 
dr gerald r plotkin at a news conference called by the 
dukakis campaign to dispel rumors the massachusetts governor has 
received psychiatric treatment said dukakis has never had such 
treatment and has been prescribed drugs only for hay fever and 
muscle sprains and aches 
he has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and 
has been in excellent health plotkin said he has never 
appeared depressed to me 
supporters of political extremist lyndon larouche were 
distributing fliers questioning dukakis mental capacity during the 
democratic national convention in atlanta 
plotkin released a threepage statement summarizing any 
treatment he has given dukakis over the past 17 years at the 
harvard community health plan a health maintenance organization 
whose services are available through the state employees benefits 
program prior to that dukakis was treated by his father a family 
doctor 
dukakis wife kitty has decribed her husband as being depressed 
following the 1973 death of his brother stelian who was killed by 
a hitandrun driver and after he lost the 1978 gubernatorial 
primary after serving four years in the office 
but mrs dukakis said wednesday during an appearance in new 
jersey that her husband has never seen a psychiatrist and plotkin 
said dukakis showed no signs of clinical depression 
there is a normal grieving after any loss from minor to 
major and the response usually is in relation to the gravity of 
the loss plotkin said i was struck at the time of both losses 
at his strength rather then his depression i saw him on a 
number of occasions and he never demonstrated any symptoms or signs 
that he would require counseling 
stelian dukakis suffered from clinical depression and once tried 
to commit suicide but plotkin said the condition was not 
hereditary 
plotkin said dukakis has been treated for 
plantar fascitis a form of minor foot discomfort associated 
with jogging dukakis was treated in 1983 he since has given up 
jogging but keeps an almost daily regimen of speed walking 
a pinched nerve in his neck in 1979 
a pulled achilles tendon in 1976 
the prescribed treatment for those conditions was rest heat and 
naproxen an antiinflammatory medicine slightly more powerful than 
aspirin plotkin said 
the doctor said dukakis also has received treatment for 
a minor fracture of his collarbone sufferred in a foot race 
in ireland in 1976 
a splinter under the nail of his left index finger in 1979 
hoarseness in 1981 which was attributed to his lecturing at 
the john f kennedy school of government 
a cyst on his back in 1986 which was drained 
plotkin said the material he had released was essentially that 
contained in his file on dukakis with the exception of personal 
notes 
he said it was possible dukakis could have seen another 
physician or a psychiatrist but he did not believe he had 
all of his tests were within normal limits plotkin said

kitty dukakis wife of democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis was quoted as saying in an interview 
published wednesday that she favors moving the us embassy to the 
disputed city of jerusalem 
her husband stirred controversy last may when he said he 
supported israels decision to move its capital from tel aviv to 
jerusalem if israel wants its capital in jerusalem then as far 
as im concerned its capital is in jerusalem dukakis told the 
los angeles times 
despite mrs dukakis remark she was quoted by the israeli 
weekly haolam hazeh as saying that the subject of the capitals 
location should not be in the headlines now 
first we must take care of more burning issues 
mrs dukakis who is jewish was interviewed in the united 
states by a haolam hazeh reporter 
israel has declared jerusalem its capital but many countries do 
not recognize it as such us officials say the us embassy must 
remain in tel aviv until the dispute over jerusalem has been 
resolved in peace negotiations 
israel annexed arab east jerusalem after capturing it from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war the city is considered holy by 
jews moslems and christians 
mrs dukakis also was quoted as saying that as first lady she 
would continue being a proud jew but as stressing that 
religion and politics must remain separate 
mrs dukakis who would be the first jewish first lady if her 
husband is elected next november also said her first visit to 
israel in 1976 renewed her interest in judaism according to the 
weekly 
that visit changed everything for me it quoted the 
51yearold mrs dukakis as saying 
haolam hazeh quoted her as saying the most important experience 
of that trip was a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem in 
jerusalem six million jews were killed by nazi germany in the 
holocaust 
my parents left germany before the holocaust they sensed what 
was going to happen she was quoted as saying i was brought up 
on this memory but i dont think i understood the full 
significance until i visited yad vashem 
her parents both jewish studied in berlin but left before 
world war ii 
mrs dukakis said that if her husband is elected she would like 
him to appoint her to the presidents commission on the holocaust 
according to the publication 
mrs dukakis was appointed to the panel by former president 
jimmy carter but his successor ronald reagan did not extend her 
term when it expired in 1986 
she also was quoted as saying her five visits to israel have 
strengthened her commitment to her religion 
i grew up in a jewish neighborhood in brookline mass i 
used to go to synagogue with my grandmother but i never studied in 
a jewish or religious school mrs dukakis said according to 
haolam hazeh 
she was quoted as saying that after returning to the united 
states from her first visit to israel in 1976 she joined a 
synagogue and began raising funds for the jewish state 
asked whether her religion would affect how she would fill her 
role as first lady she said according to the weekly there is a 
separation between church and state this is very important and 
must be protected 
it said that she added however i will continue being a proud 
jew in the white house too

president reagan giving up a fight that had

reagan who earlier this year had vigorously opposed such a 
measure said tuesday he would neither sign nor veto the required 
60day notices that both the house and senate passed last month 
with vetoproof twothirds majorities 
instead reagan said he will allow to become law on thursday 
without his signature what he called bad legislation from a 
congress more interested in scoring points with organized labor 
than in saving workers jobs 
reagan had vetoed a massive overhauling of the nations trade

military investigators believe a us navy 
cruiser attacked and destroyed an iranian airliner july 3 because 
of human mistakes made under the stress of combat defense 
officials said wednesday 
because of the mistakes the captain of the uss vincennes 
believed his ship had survived its first combat only to confront an 
approaching hostile iranian jet fighter said the sources who 
insisted on anonymity 
in reality the radar contact was a civilian airliner with 290 
people aboard that had just taken off from a large military base at 
bandar abbas iran 
the classification of that radar contact as hostile appears to 
have been made by crewmen in the heat of battle without adequate 
technical justification said one official

at a recent news conference nbcs brandon 
tartikoff facetiously suggested jerry buck private eye as a 
replacement show on the networks fall schedule 
having a somewhat proprietary view of this new show i have a 
few suggestions to make 
tartikoff who is president of nbc entertainment spoke of the 
show during a news conference outlining how the network would cope 
in the fall because of the writers strike 
explaining his idea for bringing back old shows as american 
revivals tartikoff said 
you go and get eight or 10 richie brockelman scripts and 
redo it the decadeold series with bruce willis and call it 
jerry buck private eye and i dont think viewer one would say 
wait a second didnt i see that plot back in 1979 
now i have no objection to bruce willis we do sort of look 
alike except im taller but richie brockelman private eye 
has to go thats as bad as the hardy boys which tartikoff 
actually is reviving 
richie brockelman was a wetbehindtheears kid wimp is an 
expression that comes to mind his mother and father even hung 
around and worried about him and gave him advice the show which 
ran briefly on nbc was not something youd want to see again even 
with bruce willis and even retitled jerry buck private eye 
the show was a spinoff of the rockford files now there was 
a detective series 
if tartikoff is going to bring back an old detective show and 
name it after me this is the one he should think about james 
garner was jim rockford 
rockfords father also hung around but it was different his 
pop rocky didnt stand around and wring his hands you could tell 
he was a mans man because he drove a pickup truck 
rockford was down at the heels the way a private eyes supposed 
to be instead of a walkup office in some seedy hollywood building 
and a wisecracking secretary he lived on a trailer at the beach 
and had an answering machine 
it was a great show quite possibly the best detective show ever 
on television rockford frequently used questionable methods to 
solve his cases his disguises were always so transparent his 
bribes were too cheap to ever win over anybody and he usually got 
stiffed for his fee at the end of each episode 
rockford was sometimes outsmarted by other private detectives 
most notably lance white lance white who was sort of mr perfect 
was played by tom selleck selleck of course went on to become 
thomas magnum 
perhaps tartikoff might consider the old scripts of magnum 
pi for my show i can see myself tooling around oahu in robin 
masters red ferrari i could irritate higgins as much as magnum 
id also steer clear of zeus and apollo 
peter gunn is another detective show tartikoff should think 
about reviving its not every private eye whose hangout was called 
mothers or had a girlfriend like edie besides henry 
mancinis jazzy theme was the first of the memorable television 
themes 
other possible revivals mannix mccloud barney 
miller or even the lone ranger id look good in a black 
mask 
columbo was a possibility but abc beat nbc to the punch 
theyve got peter falk back in the old raincoat theyre even 
getting back that tiny peugeot cabriolet he got around in 
so brandon thanks for the offer but ill pass on richie 
brockelman

a stimulating ally of the poor the rev gustavo 
gutierrez applies christianity in ways that have prodded and 
sometimes disturbed the church world 
he is known as the father of liberation theology which has 
drawn both acclaim and denunciations he lately discussed his 
approach to us and international church audiences 
to be a church of the poor is not to lose but to affirm our 
identity says the peruvian roman catholic priest lt is not to 
reduce the gospel it is to be more faithful to the gospel 
gutierrez 60 of lima peru coined the phrase a theology of 
liberation in a 1968 talk in a poor district and later authored 
a seminal book by that name 
his ideas have ricocheted through modern church thought 
elaborated by other theologians and gaining a widespread following 
as well as some caustic and highlevel criticism 
humorously tweaking his own writings he says 
the vatican has devised a new form of torture they have made 
me defend what i have written i have had to reread my writings 
three times 
marking the 20th anniversary of liberation theology he was 
honored at a midjuly ecumenical gathering at maryknoll ny 
headquarters of the mission order of maryknoll fathers and sisters 
liberation theology is hinged to the bibles special concern for 
the poor and jesus declaration of purpose to liberate the 
suffering and oppressed it identifies with their political 
struggles for better conditions 
the movement is particularly strong among worker base 
communities in south america critics have accused it of applying 
marxist analysis to instigate class struggle and socialism 
gutierrez says liberation theology while using marxist social 
analysis clearly excludes the possiblity of adopting marxism as 
a philosophical system which is in clear contradiction to a 
believers perspective 
this should be obvious to everyone 
the vatican in 1984 condemned some forms of liberation theology 
but then in 1986 offered a more positive assessment of it 
recognizing values in it in pursuing social justice 
the critiques included some relevant observations for 
myself gutierrez told national catholic news service he said he 
became more sensitive to the need for varied approaches 
among his observations culled by the national catholic reporter 
from his discourses at maryknoll 
i am not interested in the future of liberation theology i am 
interested in the liberation of my people 
to announce liberation theology is to announce life 
resurrection in the face of death 
we must be friends of the poor we do not love if we do not 
consider others as equals 
i have learned from my people that to be a christian is to 
find joy in the midst of suffering in finding joy i can better 
see the suffering 
gutierrez also spoke at an international conference of anglican 
bishops ending this weekend in england calling commitment to the 
poor indispensable to living close to god 
he said the poor are most sensitive to the key biblical message 
that god gives his love freely that is why the voice of the 
poor is important for all christians 
in an interview carried by lutheran world information service 
gutierrez denied liberation theology foments class struggle but he 
added 
there are conflicts in society one of which is a 
confrontation among classes it is necessary to overcome this 
situation in a perspective of justice and support for weak and 
marginalized peoples 
asked about claims he reduced religion to politics he said he 
tries to make demands of the gospel present in the social and 
poltical spheres the preferential option for the poor based on 
faith in god and jesus christ does not mean any single political 
choice but it does make demands 
he called rightwing charges that he is marxist absolutely 
false declaring christian faith gives meaning to my life he 
said there is a kind of mccarthyism at large also existing in 
certain christain sectors 
at an ecumenical dinner honoring him he was called the 
inspiration of the folks on the firing line by the rev robert 
mcafee brown a presbyterian professor emeritus of the pacific 
school of religion in berkeley calif 
chinaappointed auxiliary catholic bishop of shanghai aloysius 
jin imprisoned 27 years for his faith told gutierrez you did a 
lot of good for the chinese church 
antireligious propagandists said the church was for the rich 
but we show your book theology of liberation to the communists 
and we say to them you see the church is for the poor

congratulations reads the envelope you 
have won a free weekend at seventh heaven lakes 
if youll just take a few minutes to participate in our 
survey says the voice on the telephone well send you a 
valuable prize 
in the era of junk mail and junk calls most americans are 
familiar with well disguised pitches for products and services of 
dubious merit they have developed a healthy sales resistance 
yet when it comes to investing their money many people still 
seem to be vulnerable to hucksters and con artists who play on 
their greed 
americans lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year to 
investment fraud say the council of better business bureaus and 
the north american securities administrators association in their 
recently published book investor alert 
it touches all segments of society the rich and the poor 
the young and the old 
one thriving and especially virulent institution is the 
boiler room from which a squad of salesmen push real estate 
gold commodity options or some other deal by telephone 
boiler room operations are thriving because investors 
including some normally sensible ones persist in falling for deals 
that come in cold by telephone says brad hitchings an analyst 
at standard amp poors corp in sampps advisory publication the 
outlook 
the pitch is often highly convincing always plausible and 
well laced with correct technical jargon 
and as the bbb and nasaa observe in their book the lures 
always include assurances that you can take the next step with 
absolutely no commitments see results quickly and get your money 
back at any time if you are not satisfied with the deal 
boilerroom operators can make false promises in abundance 
because they are adept at disappearing quickly only to appear 
again with a new scam under a new name at a different address 
how can you protect yourself from financial predators like 
these and how can you distinguish between a con artist and 
somebody with a legitimate proposition to offer that might actually 
pay off 
experts on the subject say it is wise to assume the worst when 
you get an unexpected call or letter or visit from some stranger 
whose firm you have never heard of 
when in doubt the bbb and nasaa advise make no promises 
or commitments no matter how tentative it is far better to wait 
and lose an opportunity than to take the plunge and lose everything 
when hounded on the phone by a promoter dont be afraid to 
hang up without explanation you do not owe the caller anything 
in fact this kind of solicitation is an invasion of your privacy 
if you dont adopt a just say no policy advisers say do a 
lot of independent checking before you make the slightest 
commitment to any deal 
when a promoter insists an opportunity will be gone by the time 
you make your own inquiries it is almost surely a sign the 
proposition is questionable or a downright fraud 
investor alert tells the tale of a widow who was touted on a 
silver investment because international business machines corp was 
supposedly developing a new breed of computer that required pure 
silver circuitry which would cause the price of the metal to soar 
she followed the precept investigate before you invest and 
determined that the stories of new solidsilver technology had no 
basis in fact 
the silver dealer turned out to be an old hand at gold and 
silver swindles the book reports and was already folding up 
shop and moving to a new location and a new con game

the evangelical lutheran church in america says 
that none of three seminarians who publicly declared their 
homosexuality last year will be recommended for ordination in the 
53 millionmember denomination 
it said two of them jim lascaster of westminster calif and 
joel working of walcott nd were ruled out because they would 
not pledge compliance with a policy allowing only nonpracticing 
homosexuals to be ordained 
the third jeff johnson of lancaster calif was excluded after 
he told his bishop he would comply with the celibacy requirement 
and would resign if that situation changed 
bishop lyle miller of san francisco said that johnsons 
statement of compliance was conditional and temporary and 
therefore not consistent with the spirit of the abstinence 
requirement 
miller said johnson is a person of honesty and christian 
faith but differences between his position and church policy 
were too significant to allow for recommendation

in the netherlands nearly 70 percent of the

in his campaign to shake up one of 
the worlds most complete welfare states and make its citizenry 
more responsible for themselves prime minister ruud lubbers is his 
own best advertisement 
the lithe field hockey aficionado has twice chased down and 
apprehended suspects trying to steal the radio from the lubbers 
family car outside their residence 
the personal intervention by the immensely popular lubbers gave 
editorial cartoonists a field day and exemplified the changes the 
49yearold leader wants to work here 
lubbers centerright coalition in power for almost six years 
is putting the netherlands through one of the most profound swing 
in government policy since the welfare state took root following 
the depression era of privation and five years of harsh nazi rule 
during world war ii 
the prime minister commented in a recent interview with the 
associated press that the 14percent dutch unemployment rate cannot 
be addressed just by giving money to people and say okay there 
you are you have a decent life now because you have your money 
there is more than money involved in the welfare state the 
welfare state should be integrating people in the society 
lubbers said as he sipped black coffee in his office located in a 
restored 17thcentury structure known to pundits as the little 
tower 
the welfare state ethic is entrenched but so is private 
enterprise in this exportoriented nation of traders 
the governments efforts to cut government back are colliding 
with a society in which virtually every institution dealing with 
public welfare or cultural enrichment from hospitals childcare 
centers and schools to theater groups orchestras and museums 
receives public subsidies if not complete funding 
about 70 percent of the gross national product goes to pay for 
governmentprovided services from defense to health insurance 
dike building to pensions unemployment disability sick pay and 
childsupport benefits 
at the root of the system is what has come to be known 
europewide as dutch liberalism 
that dutch social philosophy is less liberalism than a pragmatic 
policy of accomodation toward divergent lifestyles ranging from 
the nations vibrant gay subculture to its squatter communities 
the historic dutch policy of tolerance drew immigrant groups who 
have helped since the 15th century to build a trading giant 
critics say that same tolerance has made the netherlands a haven 
for drug abusers and counterculture groups who bleed society 
financially 
but tolerance is a necessity in a denselypopulated multiethnic 
nation of about 146 million that is about the size of 
massachusetts connecticut and rhode island combined 
even major governmental policy decisions such as the 
potentially explosive decision to put new nato cruise missiles 
here are arrived at by consensusbuilding to avoid the image 
of policymaking by decree 
when management and labor negotiate yearly industrial wage 
standards they refer to each other as social partners the 
dutch have had no industrywide strikes in two decades 
to foot the welfare states bill the dutch citizen pays some of 
the worlds highest taxes the tax and benefits burden averages 
about 50 percent of the individuals salary not including the 20 
percent sales tax levied on most goods and services 
a good part of the tax bite goes to support the unemployed and 
the government is trying to steer away from the philosophy that the 
government dole is the only panacea for unemployment 
if i say my only objective in the welfare state is to ban 
poverty you would find a society where too many people are out of 
a job although they are paid by the welfare system lubbers told 
the ap 
on the other hand if you look only to the statistics of full 
employment you can make a horrible mistake he added you can 
have a society in which everybody has work but there is no welfare 
we have to promote a climate in which citizens feel themselves 
responsible for certain aspects of their welfare lubbers said 
in six years the lubbers government has effectively frozen most 
welfare and unemployment benefits and eliminated other social 
programs entirely in an attempt to free up capital for 
jobgenerating industrial development 
its enlistment of industry in jobtraining and placement plans 
is part of its policy of lessening daytoday dependency on the 
central government by farming out to private industry and community 
groups many government services such as health care insurance and 
housing financing 
in his first four years in office lubbers government bailed 
out one of the countrys largest shipyards in the next two years 
it was sold off government ownership of klm has gone from 54 
percent to 394 percent of the airline 
critics say lubbers is putting the health of the economy before 
the health of the man in the street in his attempt to cut a 
burdensome government deficit 
a 23 billion guilder 11 billion deficit is forecast this 
year compared to a total dutch budget of 168 billion guilders 80 
billion 
this spring the government decided on cuts for 1989 and 1990 in 
education housing and social assistance programs such as refugee 
relief the cuts are almost certain to pass parliament 
we have a welfare state but for how long said paulus plas 
of the federation of dutch trade unions the nations largest union 
group with 900000 members 
said welfare administrator berty beltman this is a group that 
will not make a revolution they are the powerless 
the lubbers government says that by trying to integrate an 
unemployed individual into society it is preserving the best 
elements of the welfare state without draining the rest of the 
economy to pay for it 
that sense of accomodation is also apparent in the dutch 
approach to international issues 
the moralistic tradition of dutch calvinism has spawned a social 
and political consciousness that leads the government as well as 
the wellinformed dutch populace to take stands on all major 
political issues 
there are strong antinuclear antiapartheid kurdish and 
propalestinian movements here amsterdam is home to the bukovsky 
foundation one of wests most active groups monitoring soviet 
dissidents 
but the dutch are staunch members of the western alliance and 
frequently adopt foreign policy positions close to those of the 
us government 
in his first term lubbers took on an issue that was perceived 
as a loaded gun pointed at his government the proposal to put new 
cruise missiles in the netherlands recognizing the grassroots 
sentiment against nuclear weapons lubbers moved the issue through 
parliament slowly refusing to be pushed and allowing all sides to 
have a say 
the siting idea was approved in november 1985 and lubbers 
coalition handily won the 1986 election then president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev agreed to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons and the dutch breathed a 
collective sigh of relief 
looking back on that treaty lubbers recalled that a reporter 
had asked who he thought was the man of the year 
he expected me to say gorbachev but i said us secretary of 
state george shultz of course 
i think shultz was the most important participant in the 
process he had very good timing his substance and political 
judgment was very good 
or to put it another way he could probably handle dutchstyle 
accomodation and consensusbuilding

dutch politics since the 17th century have been marked by 
attempts to forge compromise and harmony between competing 
interests and ideologies said leen vroegindewey a political 
scientist at leiden university the nations oldest 
more often than not those compromises are far more pragmatic 
than partisan solutions would be in the sense that the sharp 
ideological edges have eroded from the issue in the course of the 
public debate vroegindewey told the associated press in a recent 
interview 
the euthanasia debate raged for years in parliament newspapers 
hospitals and from the pulpit the practice is widespread here 
with an estimated 5000 cases annually according to recent 
government figures 
the centerright coalition government of prime minister ruud 
lubbers in which the antieuthanasia christian democrats dominate 
vetoed a proposal to permit euthanasia it then introduced 
legislation that does not decriminalize euthanasia but sets 
guidelines that physicians can use as a defense in courts 
in the few euthanasia cases that have gone to court only 
suspended sentences have been routinely imposed vroegindewey 
referred to the legislation which has not yet come to a vote as 
an archetypical dutch compromise 
in another example police tolerate the smallscale possession 
and use of hashish and marijuana which is readily available in 
dutch coffee shops the city has methadone clinics for its 
estimated 7000 drug addicts 
there has been a lot of clamor in the surrounding countries on 
how we do it here said amsterdam police spokesman klaas wilting 
but id like to claim that although we havent solved the drug 
problem its at least contained 
after a spectacular rise in the 1970s and early 1980s the 
number of drugrelated crimes stabilized and while cocaine 
consumption in the united states skyrocketed here it declined 
according to the dutch justice ministry 
despite the opposition of the religious right the dutch 
government reacted to acquired immune deficiency syndrome with a 
safe sex information campaign and local authorities provided 
free hypodermic needles to intravenous drug abusers one of the 
worst risk groups 
whatever the government might think of it they know that 
proselytizing against adultery promiscuity and premarital sex will 
have very little impact here said amsterdam sociologist enna van 
lingen 
amsterdam health authorities claim the free needle program has 
been a major factor in fighting aids only 539 cases have been 
reported in the netherlands one of the lowest incidence rates in 
the western world

are the republicans really ready for the 
allnight bars the strip joints and the crossdressers in full 
beard and makeup that have become synonymous with new orleans 
this city doesnt fit the bluesuited buttoneddown image of a 
george bush or the piety of a pat robertson the standing joke 
around town is that the unabashed bawdiness of new orleans will be 
wasted on the gop 
but ready or not the republicans are coming and if they look 
beyond the strip joints and obscene posters in the tshirt shops 
theyll find that there is more to new orleans than licentiousness 
and inebriation 
we really want them to get under the skin of this city said 
peggy wilson the only republican on the city council its not 
like other american cities it has sort of a funny personality we 
feel if people get to know it theyll like it and want to come 
back 
some 510 parties will be held to welcome the republicans to new 
orleans all but four by invitation only 
the parties include one to celebrate the opening of the citys 
newest shopping mall a 100aperson fundraiser at the audobon 
zoo designed to raise up to 400000 to help the city defray 
convention costs and a 10aperson prayer breakfast 
the new orleans museum of art is sponsoring a picnic a grand 
party for the grand old party in city park on aug 12 the 
friday before the convention begins 
among the other things new orleans has to offer the delegates 
gluttony sometimes elegant gluttony about 2500 restaurants 
lie in a 50mile radius they range from the swanky splendor of 
commanders palace which rests among the 19th century mansions of 
the garden district to the backslapping camaraderie of scores of 
neighborhood eateries 
seafood from the gulf of mexico is a staple at most of these 
places creole cooking born of french and spanish influences is 
also a specialty as is cajun cuisine a legacy of french canadian 
exiles who started settling the southwestern part of the state in 
the 1760s 
about 200 restaurants are so eager to please visitors that they 
will extend operating hours until after midnight 
music jazz is the musical staple of new orleans its not as 
prevalent in the french quarter as it used to be but its there 
at openair night clubs near the french market under a street lamp 
where a lone musician plays his saxophone or at preservation hall 
the musty hole in the wall on st peter street where traditional 
jazz is home 
rhythm and blues and rock are readily available cajun bands 
play for dances some clubs cater to contemporary jazz there are 
cabarets and floor shows classical music is hard to find however 
since the symphony hit on hard times and became inactive 
history and culture museums and centuryold buildings in the 
garden district and the quarter are big tourist attractions so are 
the ornate aboveground tombs in the citys floodprone 
cemeteries the republicans are lining up several guided tours 
including trips to antebellum plantations up the mississippi river 
shopping upscale art galleries and antique shops share the 
quarter with the strip joints and bars some fancy shops have 
relocated to magazine street closer to homes in the rich garden 
district 
despite the areas depressed economy new retail developments 
have been springing up the riverwalk along the mississippi 
opened a couple of years ago hosting tenants such as abercrombie amp 
fitch saks fifth avenue is downtown macys and lord amp taylor are 
part of a new complex adjacent to the superdome 
animals the audubon park zoo once derided as one of the worst 
zoos in the country has been transformed over the last decade into 
a nationally acclaimed showcase its latest pride and joy a pair 
of rare white baby alligators 
sport well sometimes the city lost its pro basketball team 
in 1976 and major league baseball is still a dream delegates 
missed out on their one chance to see football when the new orleans 
saints winners last year after 20 years of losing moved a 
planned august exhibition game out of town so their home stadium 
the superdome can play host to the gop

among the mementos treasury secretary james a 
baker iii keeps on the wall in his office are a photograph of a 
smiling george bush and a framed copy of a texas newspaper article 
from the 1930s 
the bush picture is autographed what would we do without real 
friends and the newspaper article quotes millionaire grandfather 
captain james a bakers formula for success work hard 
study and keep out of politics 
when it came to that last piece of advice baker went his own 
way that real friend is part of the reason why 
baker is poised to become bushs presidential campaign chairman 
after resigning his treasury job its a scene similar to the one 
18 years ago when baker took time out from his houston corporate 
law practice to dabble in politics for the first time 
at the time baker heeded a request for campaign help from a 
tennis partner at the houston country club thencongressman george 
bush who was running for the senate against a democrat named 
lloyd bentsen 
bitten by the political bug baker then a democrat became a 
republican at bushs urging and a fast friendship and political 
alliance blossomed between the two texans their careers have been 
intertwined ever since 
clearly baker is leaving the treasury post with some reluctance 
baker has amassed more influence than any other recent secretary 
of the treasury a job he assumed in 1985 when as president 
reagans firstterm chiefofstaff he engaged in a celebrated 
job switch with donald t regan 
the nation is in its 69th month of a record peacetime expansion 
unemployment is it at lowest level in 14 years and the nations 
massive trade deficit finally is beginning to shrink due in part 
to bakers intricate management of the dollar 
he is credited with steering the 1986 taxoverhaul bill through 
congress just as he had manuevered the reagan tax cut through a 
democratic congress in 1981 as chief of staff 
baker has won plaudits internationally for persuading us 
allies to coordinate their economic polices and for negotiating a 
uscanadian free trade pact 
these are some of the things i think will survive this 
administration and i think they are hopefully some important 
achievements baker said in an interview 
while it is believed that baker could have any post in a bush 
administration he wanted his associates say he would like to be 
secretary of state the 58yearold baker shrugs off such 
speculation 
i would like to make sure i finish my job here and do it 
right 
baker and bush six years his senior seem to be cut out of 
the same patrician cloth 
both come from wealthy families both went to prep schools in 
the east bush to phillips academy in andover mass and baker to 
the hill school in pottstown pa and both graduated from ivy 
league colleges baker princeton bush yale 
baker who was born in houston and bush who grew up in 
connecticut but considers texas his adopted state both are viewed 
as political moderates and pragmatists 
both share a love of mexican food and sports 
bush boats and fishes baker fishes and hunts 
and while both baker and bush have proven adept at winning 
appointive office baker also served as an undersecretary of 
commerce in the ford administration the two have been less 
successful in getting each other elected 
despite bakers help bush lost that 1970 senate race to bentsen 
as well as his 1980 race against reagan for the republican 
presidential nominaiton and despite bushs help baker lost his 
only try at elective office a 1978 race for texas attorney 
general 
still baker today has a reputation as one of the republican 
partys craftiest political strategists a reputation honed when 
he signed on in 1976 as president gerald fords chief delegate 
hunter after ford lost five straight primaries to ronald reagan 
baker came up with the delegates that helped ford narrowly 
defeat reagan for the gop nomination and as generalelection 
campaign manager for ford saw the former presidents 30plus lag in 
the polls to democrat jimmy carter close to within one percentage 
point of the total vote 
baker is also credited with masterminding bushs dramatic 
victory in the iowa caucuses in 1980 
hes very good he was very good for ford when he really did 
make a big difference when he got deeply involved and hes been a 
good help to bush said john sears a political consultant who 
represented reagan in that 1976 headtohead scramble with baker 
for delegates 
for one thing he brings to the 1988 bush campaign one very 
important ingredient he can handle the candidate no one else is 
around who has that kind of level relationship with george said 
sears 
a good campaign manager has to have a multitude of virtues bush 
wrote in his autobiography looking forward the most 
important he said is being able to tell his candidate what the 
candidate doesnt want to hear 
that moment of truth came in june 1980 right before the 
california primary when bush was seriously trailing reagan and out 
of money but wanted to press on anyway 
bush quotes baker as telling him the campaign is finished 
george youre the only one who doesnt seem to know it 
reagan made baker a special campaign assistant after the 1980 
convention baker took on the role of helping reagan prepare for 
his debates against thenpresident carter 
when reagan was elected he quickly announced that baker would 
be his chiefofstaff 
baker quickly went to work in quietly guiding reagans 
supplyside tax cut and other firstterm initiatives through 
congress his ability to get along with congressional democrats 
continued after he switched jobs 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee calls baker an honest adversary with a first 
class political gut 
many baker admirers claim that some of the problems afflicting 
the reagan administration over the past few years including the 
irancontra arms sales might not have happened had baker remained 
on as chief of staff with his immense attention for detail 
still despite bakers celebrated penchant for caution and 
keeping out of the public spotlight he hasnt always been 
successful 
in 1985 aboard air force one en route to china with reagan 
baker was asked if hed ever been to a communist country well 
ive been to massachsetts he said 
that comment for which baker later apologized brought a 
testy letter from the states governor michael dukakis dukakis 
invited baker to ride on the boston subway route known as the red 
line 
and some economists claim that bakers remarks in criticizing 
west german interest rates last october helped trigger the record 
508point stock market crash 
his comments clearly disturbed the markets said david wyss 
chief financial economist for data resources inc he was pushing 
a little to hard 
however wyss overall said baker has been a very good treasury 
secretary he made some mistakes but he grew into the job 
one of bakers chief initiatives as treasury secretary a plan 
to help ease the third world debt crisis with a 29 million package 
of new loans mostly from commercial banks never bore fruit 
however baker still lists that debtrelief plan as one of his 
major initiatives and one that may still come to pass our 
approach is the only viable approach if youre not going to try to 
solve the debt problem on the backs of taxpayers in creditor 
countries he said

pat robertson says the legacy of his 
failed presidential bid are the tens of thousands of people who 
are now activated in the political life of america and the 25 
minutes of prime time the republican national committee will give 
him at the convention 
but longtime robertson watchers say the former southern baptist 
preacher and president of the christian broadcasting network may be 
misinterpreting his political impact 
he is going to have a very miniscule role in the convention 
said mark rozell a political scientist from mary washington 
university in fredericksburg va and frankly i think he is 
overstating his importance to the conservative movement 
its a mixed blessing that robertson bestows on the party 
said larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist 
he is not an appealing figure to young republicans who bring a 
libertarian flavor to the party robertson is anything but 
libertarian 
robertson sees himself as the partys conservative 
standardbearer leading thousands of new members 
the reward that i have from this effort robertson said 
recently in an interview with the associated press is to be 
found in the tens of thousands of people who are now activated in 
the political life of america 
robertsons campaign utilized a strong grassroots organization 
of political neophytes many from fundamentalist or charismatic 
churches to seize control of the party leadership on the local 
level in several states 
the operation resulted in a pattern for the campaign poor 
finishes in primaries such as new hampshire and moderate successes 
in caucuses including iowa 
in his home state of virginia robertson placed third among 
three candidates seven days later he laid off his top two 
campaign aides cut the staff and said he would limit his 
campaigning to states with caucuses 
in april robertson said he was withdrawing from the race then 
later amended that to suspending his campaign while pledging his 
support for bush robertson refused to release his delegates 
saying he wanted to go to the national convention as the 
conservative voice of the party 
shortly thereafter he returned to cbn to rescue the financially 
strapped religious broadcasting empire that had laid off more than 
1000 workers during his campaign and cut its budget by more than 
40 percent as contributions dwindled 
robertson goes to the convention pushing for a platform that 
mirrors the 1980 and 1984 versions on which ronald reagan was 
elected those battles were fought and won by conservatives at the 
last two conventions giving robertson no new ground 
and with only about 200 delegates to bushs 2000 robertson 
has no leverage on the platform issues rozell said 
the robertson people are perceived to be there not to support 
the ticket but to support pat said rozell who is the coeditor 
of a soontobe released book on the contemporary conservative 
movement so the party regulars are making overtures to them 
through robertson 
robertson said his speech will deal with foreign policy sabato 
believes the topic is significant 
i think its an attempt to keep him off social issues where he 
tends to turn off young people he said you can bet that 
bushs people will be at work editing the speech 
robertson points to the scheduling of his speech the tuesday 
night of the convention as a sign of his standing in the party 
his speech follows a tribute to former arizona sen barry 
goldwater the partys 1964 presidential nominee and longtime 
leader of its conservative wing 
robertson will be introduced by goldwaters former campaign 
manager cliff white showing the continuity of conservatism over 
the last 25 years of the party 
it would be nice to have barry goldwaters campaign manager 
come and say this is the conservative leader who fits in with some 
of the things that have come from the past robertson said 
that is a vast overstatement rozell said and i imagine a 
lot of conservatives are uncomfortable most of them came up 
through the ranks of government and fought for the conservative 
cause from within now robertson is showing up an outsider and 
claiming to be the heirapparent 
that ought to anger the new york rep jack kemp 
supporters he said 
robertson who is back hosting the cbns flagship program the 
700 club said he hopes to broaden news coverage and its appeal 
to young professional viewers he said the ministry has turned the 
corner and that donations are starting to go up again 
but his presidential campaign is still more than 1 million in 
debt and he has turned to his supporters for more money couched 
in language that is vintage robertson 
i ran for president because i felt god wanted me to run for 
president he said in a recent letter to supporters my faith 
was ridiculed my motives and my words distorted lies were spread 
about my war record my education and my resume 
why did i go through all of this the answer is very simple 
god does not want us to turn america over to radical feminists 
drug dealers militant homosexuals profligate spenders humanists 
or world communists god does not want our unborn babies 
slaughtered our homes broken up our bodies defiled or our little 
children forbidden to pray in our schools 
he then asks for 25 donations to retire the debt otherwise 
all my future work as your champion would be injured

fears of surging inflation have remained modest among many 
observers despite three government reports indicating surprisingly 
robust economic growth in the month of june 
the governments main forecasting gauge rose 14 percent its 
biggest gain in 18 months sales of new homes shot up 84 percent 
and orders to us factories for manufactured goods soared 55 
percent the government said tuesday in a series of reports 
prices rose tuesday in the bond market which often is hurt by 
news of strong growth because of the fear that a boom in the 
economy will contribute to higher inflation and erode the value of 
fixedincome securities 
meanwhile the stock market struggled through an uneven session 
as the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 071 point to 
213122 stocks normally react better than bonds to strong 
economic growth because of the prospect for rising corporate 
profits 
the commerce department said the increase in its index of 
leading indicators was the sharpest rise in 18 months 
analysts credited renewed consumer confidence for the rebound in 
sales of new homes after a sluggish period earlier this spring 
the 55 percent rise in factory orders was the largest onemonth 
advance in more than 17 years and was propelled by the biggest 
increase in military orders in more than five years 
the leading index has been up in four of the last five months 
you have to consider that very good news for the economy said 
david wyss chief financial economist for data resources inc 
there is certainly no sign of a recession coming at least for the 
rest of this year 
the economy as measured by the gross national product expanded 
at a healthy 33 percent annual rate in the first six months of 
1988 far better than many economists had expected following last 
octobers stock market crash 
given the momentum provided by exceptionally strong activity in 
june many analysts said they expected growth in the current 
julyseptember quarter to remain strong 
many analysts worry that strong growth eventually will prompt 
the federal reserve board to boost interest rates to restrain 
inflation 
the fed in a review of the economy released tuesday noted 
rising prices for a wide variety of materials from metals and paper 
to food the report prepared for fed policymakers said high 
factory operating rates in many industries were beginning to reach 
capacity restraints 
many analysts say that while the economy will continue growing 
at a good clip this year the feds efforts to fight inflationary 
pressures could result in a recession sometime in 1989 
analysts said the increase in the leading index partly was a 
rebound from may when the index dropped 08 percent after three 
months of solid gains the june advance was the biggest onemonth 
rise since the index climbed 22 percent in december 1986

take effective action to bolster oil prices 
i think theres a lot of doubt said peter beutel assistant 
director of the energy group at elders futures inc 
even if the meeting of the fivemember pricemonitoring 
committee turns into a fullscale opec ministerial conference the 
market could remain skeptical beutel said then the question 
becomes what are they opec going to do from there he said 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita arriving for the 
meeting in lausanne said tuesday he would not exclude the 
possibility of an emergency opec conference following the 
pricemonitoring panels meeting

texaco incs disclosure that it plans to sell 
its majority holding in profitable texaco canada inc has drawn 
renewed interest from two canadian oil companies that previously 
had talked about buying the stake 
texaco said tuesday it has decided to sell its 78 percent stake 
in texaco canada which is worth about 27 billion at current 
stock prices analysts estimate that a buyer purchasing the entire 
block probably would pay a premium price of between 3 billion and 
4 billion 
the sale of the canadian subsidiary would be the third major 
sale of operating assets under texacos continuing restructuring 
program although analysts characterized the spinoff as going 
beyond the 5 billion program 
fresh from victory in a bitter proxy fight with carl c icahn 
texaco already has orchestrated the sale of more than 25 billion 
in assets 
k peter maneri a texaco spokesman would not comment on 
whether texaco was engaged in negotiations over texaco canada but 
analysts said they suspected the company would not have made the 
announcement unless interested parties at least had been identified 
maneri would say only that the company has had expressions of 
interest from buyers in the past 
canadian occidental petroleum ltd which is 48 percent held by 
occidental petroleum corp of los angeles and husky oil ltd 
previously expressed interest in the texaco canada stake and both 
said tuesday they still were interested 
icahn who was defeated in his quest for five seats on texacos 
board said in june that he had discussed a texaco takeover with 
husky and gulf canada resources ltd 
gulf canada said tuesday it was interested in acquisitions but 
was not aggressively pursuing texaco canada at this time 
texaco had been studying various options surrounding texaco 
canada including the possible sale merger or joint venture of 
some or all of the stake 
james w kinnear texacos president and chief executive 
officer said that we have concluded that pursuing negotiations 
toward sale of our interest best meets the objective of 
maximizing texaco canadas value to texaco and its shareholders 
the company said in a statement it might be interested in 
retaining certain texaco canada assets particularly its foreign 
exploration ventures with texaco 
texaco canada owns two refineries and two lubricant blending and 
greasemaking plants in canada the subsidiary has 1800 
texacobrand retail outlets across canada 
the operation controls 104 percent of the canadian petroleum 
products market and 135 percent of the gasoline market 
the canadian operations are clean and neat both from the 
production side and from the marketing and refining side said 
jack aydin a managing director of the investment firm mcdonald amp 
co 
he also said the subsidiary was respectably profitable 
kinnear said in a statement that the possible sale would 
represent another major advance in the companys restructuring 
program 
but aydin said it looks like they carried the restructuring 
plan one step more to give shareholders a little bit more and 
possibly to defuse a potential problem down the road 
he was referring to the fact that while icahn remains texacos 
largest shareholder he could sell his 149 percent stake and 
management might have to confront another dissident shareholder 
bruce lazier an analyst at prescott ball amp turben inc said 
it might be possible for a buyer to acquire icahns block and then 
trade it for shares in texaco canada 
icahn would have to rate right up there in terms of texacos 
priorities he said 
texaco started putting the restructuring program into place in 
june when the company announced it would sell its west german 
operations for 125 billion to rheinishwestfaelisches 
elektrizitaetswerk ag also that month texaco entered into a 128 
billion deal to sell 50 percent of its refining and marketing 
operations in 23 states to saudi arabia 
the company has said it plans to distribute to shareholders 17 
billion of the money it raises in the restructuring 
the keystone of texacos restructuring plan was a 3 billion 
payment to pennzoil co to settle a lawsuit resulting from texacos 
1984 acquisition of getty oil co after pennzoil had made earlier 
moves to acquire getty

a net 15900 securities industry employees lost 
their jobs in the six months ended march 31 a period that included 
the 1987 stock market crash according to an industry study 
the joint study published tuesday was conducted by the 
securities industry association and the accounting firm arthur 
andersen amp co 
it said about 262200 employees were employed in the securities 
industry as of sept 30 1987 the last benchmark before the oct 
19 crash that number dropped to 260500 employees as of dec 31 
1987 and to 246300 by march 31 of this year 
nearly all the dismissals occurred at major brokerage firms and 
big investment banks sia officials said 
the 15900 employees fired between the crash and the end of the 
first quarter included about 6900 stockbrokers and 9000 support 
staff the study said 
although the layoffs were painful in human terms they were a 
necessary part of the industrys acrosstheboard efforts to lower 
expenses which were rising out of control causing diminishing 
profit margins and lower returns on investment sia president 
edward i obrien said in a statement 
the emphasis on measuring productivity is good news for the 
securities industry said lawrence a weinbach chief operating 
officer of arthur andersen it underscores the increasing focus 
on cost control 
before the market plunge the study said the brokerage industry 
had been hiring employees the industry added around 2200 
employees between jan 1 1987 and march 31 of this year nearly 
all of them before the october crash

after a year of recovery the mexican economy 
is expected to slide into recession in the last half of 1988 as the 
government continues its attempts to curb inflation private sector 
analysts say 
although labor leaders dispute the claim the government says 
consumer price inflation slowed from 155 percent in january to 2 
percent in june under its economic solidarity pact 
under the stabilization plan which comes up for another 
extension at the end of august government labor farmers and the 
private sector agreed to hold down wages prices and public 
spending and stop the tumbling exchange rate between the peso and 
the us dollar 
but analysts say inflation is unlikely to fall much further this 
year 
in june the monthly declines bottomed out due to excess 
liquidity higherthanusual prices for some perishables because of 
unfavorable weather and the service sectors traditionally slow 
response to deflationary processes according to a report by the 
private sector economic studies center 
private forecasters estimate inflation for the year will range 
from 55 percent to 67 percent after a record 1592 percent in 
1987 the 12month rate in june was 1358 percent 
the governments unofficial target for this year as of april 
was 462 percent 
economic growth the last half of 1987 amounted to a 16 percent 
increase in the gross domestic product for the full year growth in 
the first half of this year was 2 percent according to the private 
sector center 
but with contraction the second half the forecasters including 
the center and the forecasting firm macro asesoria economica say 
gdp will shrink between 1 percent and 33 percent for the year 
the governmentprogrammed recession for the last six months of 
the year is one of the most important parts of the economic 
policy said jonathan heath coordinating director of macro 
asesoria 
its important to induce the recession so when they start 
lifting the freeze prices dont increase he said 
the recessive process the economy will face in the second 
semester and perhaps during the first quarter of 1989 despite all 
the negative effects that may result will be an indispensable 
condition for consolidating the process of lowering inflation 
the private sector centers report said 
policies that avoid it cannot and should not be implemented 
since the risk would be an acceleration of inflation it said 
assistant commerce secretary jesus sanchez jimenez said last 
week prices on some basic goods including eggs and milk will be 
raised in september 
heath said the minimum wage frozen since march likely will be 
increased in september but probably by no more than 6 percent an 
amount he said most businesses could absorb without raising prices 
the daily minimum wage increased 3 percent in march to 8000 
pesos or about 350 
the government is expected to announce its own new spending cuts 
soon 
under the pact it has not boosted rates on electricity water 
or other public services lower prices for oil exports also have 
cut into income while interest rates on the countrys 104 billion 
foreign debt second highest in the developing world have risen 
also cooling the economy in the last half of the year the 
centers report said will be a tightening of credit and the money 
supply effects of the quick opening of the economy to foreign 
competition price freezes high interest rates and slowing mexican 
exports 
undervaluation of the peso currency helped boost nonpetroleum 
exports 22 percent in the first half of the year holding the peso 
steady against the dollar has shrunk that advantage

for years thomas timms customers have been 
thinning out now his suppliers are too 
shrinking ranks of wig manufacturers and other industry problems 
have raised the possibility of sharply higher prices and low wig 
supplies in coming months says timm owner of tresschic fashion 
salon in seattle and partowner of reidmeredith inc in laurence 
mass a synthetic hair pioneer and the last remaining us wig 
maker 
timm considered an authority on the wig industry says two of 
the six south korean companies that manufacture 98 percent of the 
wigs worn in the united states have gone out of business the other 
four have suffered strikes and the loss of workers to higherpaying 
jobs in the garment and electronics industries 
as a result hair lines are receding timm is worried he may be 
unable to acquire enough wigs in enough styles to meet customer 
demand in coming months 
suppliers also are raising prices with one distributor having 
announced a 45percent price increase timm said that because of 
the korean manufacturing problems prices of even the cheaper wigs 
likely will increase to 85 from 60 each 
many of reidmerediths sales are to movie and television 
productions timms customers have ranged from the muppets to 
raquel welch that can afford more expensive wigs 
but timm says many of his salon customers are cancer patients 
who have lost hair because of radiation treatments or chemotherapy 
and can not meet the higher prices 
furthermore in response to their labor troubles some korean 
manufacturers have raised their minimum orders from 1000 wigs to 
100000 timm said that could drive some smaller distributors out 
of business 
until the mid1960s most wigs were made of human hair but timm 
said they were expensive heavy and hard to manage then modacrylic 
fiber a synthetic came along 
we found it in rugs said timm so the old joke about 
someone with a toupee wearing a rug wasnt that far off 
reidmeredith researchers found out how to make modacrylic look 
like hair it also was inexpensive light didnt soak up water and 
held a permanent wave 
wig prices dropped to as little as 1995 reidmeredith was 
churning out 1000 a week and we couldnt fill the pipeline 
timm said if we could have made 1000 a day wed have sold them 
all we created a market 
in the 1960s we were the largest distributor there was 
timm said 
then the japanese and later the koreans got into the business 
reidmeredith survived but was hit hard by foreign competitors 
because of their lower labor costs 
but timm said korean wig workers are tiring of sixday work 
weeks in what he describes as sweatshop conditions for some of the 
lowest wages in their country timm expects that within two to 
three years china will be the industrys bigwig 
in the interim reidmeredith stands to gain its wigs which 
sell retail starting at around 110 are becoming more competitive 
with the increasingly costly korean models 
timm said us wigs are better made and last longer than the 
korean products 
weve done 100000 customers in the seattle area he says 
you pass them every day you just dont see them theyre 
invisible the only wigs that look like wigs are the ones that are 
poorly done

environmental activists claiming 
retailers have been playing hide and seek with consumer health 
said they will try to force stores to post cancer warnings for 225 
tobacco products mostly cigars and pipe tobacco 
three environmental groups and tom haydens campaign california 
political organization announced plans tuesday to file a 13 
billion lawsuit against eight major retail chains and 27 tobacco 
companies claiming they have failed to adequately warn customers 
about risks in the tobacco products 
they took the action under a citizens suit provision of 
proposition 65 a controversial 1986 ballot measure that requires 
warnings for a long list of substances believed to cause cancer or 
birth defects 
proposition 65 allows private parties to sue under its 
provisions if prosecutors fail to act after receiving 60 days 
notice from the potential plaintiffs 
david roe an attorney for the environmental defense fund and 
carl pope of the sierra club announced at a news conference that 
they were giving that notice if they dont act we will roe 
said 
proposition 65 allows fines of up to 2500 a day for a 
violation pope and roe said the 13 billion figure used by their 
groups was a fairly conservative estimate of the maximum 
potential liability faced by the chains and tobacco companies 
pope said the groups targeted the 225 tobacco products because 
they do not carry federally required package warnings like 
cigarettes do and have a welldocumented cancer risk 
leslie howe vice president for governmental affairs for the 
california retailers association declined to discuss the issue 
this is the type of thing that attorneys talk to other attorneys 
about he said 
a tobacco institute representative in sacramento did not return 
a reporters phone call 
but norman f sharp president of the cigar association of 
america and the pipe tobacco council told the new york times the 
tobacco industry took great pains to comply with the law 
placing advertisements in 58 newspapers across the state and 
sending out more than a million notices for retailers to place on 
shelves 
the eight chains targeted by the environmentalists are 
albertsons inc the alpha beta co lucky stores inc raleys 
ralphs grocery co safeway stores inc thrifty drug and discount 
stores and vons grocery co 
roe said group representatives had been in some stores operated 
by the chains and had not found warning signs for the tobacco 
products 
tobacco companies cited by the groups include rj reynolds 
united states tobacco co consolidated cigar co and general cigar 
co

the price monitoring committee of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries met today to 
discuss the cartels continuing overproduction and pricing problems 
the fivenation committee comprising ministers from venezuela 
nigeria saudi arabia indonesia and algeria met behind closed 
doors at a luxury hotel in this lakeside city 
venezuelan oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti said tuesday 
one item on the agenda would be a report by opec secretarygeneral 
subroto of indonesia on his visit to the united arab emirates in 
july 
subroto visited the uae after it decided to abandon its opec 
oil production quota of 948000 barrels a day and said it would aim 
for a daily output of 15 million barrels 
the committee is also to discuss the opec auditors report for 
the cartels production in may as well as estimates from secondary 
sources for june and july production 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said tuesday that 
industry estimates for june opec production were between 
18541856 million barrels a day while july production estimates 
were understood to be around 19 million barrels a day 
one opec delegate source said 19 million barrels a day is 
definitely too much for opec to be producing we will never see 
prices recover in the shorttomedium term at that level 
in a related development saudi arabian oil minister hisham 
nazer responding to press reports that his countrys oil output in 
july was above its opec quota said wednesday that is wrong 
he said saudi arabia is producing within its output quota of 4343 
million barrels a day 
the opec price committee is empowered to study world oil price 
trends and to call an emergency meeting of the full 13member opec 
ministerial conference if it finds that world oil prices have 
diverged significantly from opecs 18abarrel average reference 
price 
delegate sources said another topic of discussion by the pricing 
committee would be the effect on opec production levels of a 
possible ceasefire between iran and iraq 
the sources said that two opinions have apparently arisen on the 
possible effect 
some within opec believe a ceasefire could result in the two 
countries flooding world oil markets with crude as they try to 
sell more oil to finance the reconstruction of their wartorn 
economies 
others seem to think that an end to the war would mean greater 
cooperation within opec and lead to production restraint the 
sources said

willamette industries inc has reached a 
tentative settlement with two unions that have been on strike 
against it and several other northwest woodproducts companies for 
nearly two months 
the settlement tuesday was the first since the strike began june 
6 it came during the second day of negotiations with a federal 
mediator in portland said cathy baldwin a company spokeswoman 
industry and union officials are optimistic the settlement will 
lead to agreements with the other companies said a source close to 
the negotiations who asked not to be named 
baldwin said no details of the proposed pact would be released 
until the 1275 striking workers with the portlandbased company 
vote on it thursday 
it was a fair compromise she said 
mike draper executive secretary of the western council of 
industrial workers said he was pleased with the contract we 
didnt get everything on our wish list but neither did willamette 
industries he said 
the western council and the international woodworkers of 
americaus went on strike against willamette industries and 
several other companies after negotiations broke down a total of 
13 willamette mills and logging operations were affected in sweet 
home lebanon dallas and albany 
the strike spread to eight companies with operations in oregon 
washington idaho montana and northern california affecting an 
estimated 9000 workers including those with willamette industries 
willamette industries and the other companies had met just once 
with the unions during the past two weeks and each session lasted 
less than two hours the latest negotiations lasted a total of 14 
hours monday and tuesday federal mediator paul stuckenschneider 
said 
the other companies affected by the strike are boise cascade 
corp champion international corp simpson timber co daw forest 
products inc and wi forest products inc the western council also 
has struck two smaller companies lakeview lumber co and a door 
plant operated by morgan products ltd in springfield 
the unions also have threatened to strike weyerhaeuser co the 
regions largest woodproducts company with 6000 union members in 
oregon and washington union officials said last week however 
that the weyerhaeuser strike plans were on hold 
the workers have sought restoration of wages and benefits cut in 
1986 when the industry was in a recession the unions accepted the 
cuts after a series of strikes 
company officials have said they cannot not restore wages and 
still compete with smaller nonunion mills some of the companies 
however have offered bonus plans in lieu of wage hikes 
one union official recently said the unions were willing to 
consider a combination of wage increases and bonuses as long as the 
wage increases comprised the bulk of the additional compensation 
willamette industries which employs 8600 workers overall 
manufactures wood and paper products its paper mills have not been 
affected by the strike 
baldwin said that in the strikes first eight weeks 16 
million in wages were lost just in the small town of sweet home 
where four mills were shut down 
in an interview last week baldwin said the woodproducts 
industry had not rebounded as well as officials had hoped it would 
theres no question that we feel our people deserve wage 
increases she said but the question is how much 
i think everyone thought in 1986 when we had to take wage 
cuts that the economic climate would change and would be a lot 
more hospitable for the forestproducts industry in 1988 that 
never happened however

president reagans refusal to embrace a white 
house commissions call for federal antidiscrimination laws to 
protect aids victims brought criticism today from commission 
members 
rather than embrace the panels proposal for federal 
legislation reagan on tuesday referred the question to the justice 
department for more study he did however accept most of the 
commissions other recommendations and ordered federal agencies not 
to discriminate against workers with the aids virus 
i think its a shame that its being postponed again to make a 
serious decision on this matter said committee member frank 
lilly on abctvs good morning america 
lilly said a federal law is needed because discrimination exists 
even in many states that have similar legislation and because 
people will not be tested if they have no guarantee against 
discrimination 
another commission member beny primm said on the same program 
that the medical community is disappointed that the president did 
not completely tightly embrace the complete report 
commission member katherine gebbie interviewed in portland 
ore on nbctvs today said she is not satisfied with the 
presidents position and affirmed that the commission saw the 
antidiscrimination recommendation as the cornerstone of its report 
we heard that from so many hundreds of witnesses that absent 
such assured protection clearly nationwide too many people would 
not be able to come forward and really cooperate with us in 
fighting this epidemic ms gebbie said 
reagans action did not surprise critics of his position on the 
aids issue 
in a sense i guess i should have expected this because this 
has been the general tenor of this administration dr mervyn 
silverman a leader of the private american foundation for aids 
research said tuesday after reagans response 
the effect of reagans action silverman said in a telephone 
interview is to scuttle the prospect for the remaining six months 
of the administration 
vice president george bush and massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis the contenders to succeed reagan in the oval office both 
are on record favoring federal antidiscrimination legislation 
health professionals like silverman say their wish for such laws 
is based on the belief that they are essential to fighting the 
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome by encouraging people 
who may be infected with the virus to come forward for testing and 
counseling before they infect others 
without strong protections against loss of jobs and homes they 
say the people most likely to test positive for the virus choose 
to go untested 
without the magic bullet of a cure all we have is the 
ability hopefully to get people to change behavior which quite 
often is linked to education which quite often is linked to testing 
and counseling silverman said 
retired navy adm james d watkins the aids commission chairman 
who recommended an antidiscrimination law over the opposition of 
five of the 13 panel members sought to put the best face on the 
presidents refusal to back his stand 
i am pleased that the president has taken this important first 
step so necessary to setting the right tone for the nation to deal 
with the hiv epidemic said watkins vacationing in canada 
the white house issued reagans statement and he did not appear 
before reporters to discuss his 10point action plan which was 
a response to 597 recommendations the commission made june 24 just 
after the response was released tuesday the president spoke at a 
white house ceremony honoring senior executive branch employees 
sen edward kennedy dmass said that referring the 
antidiscrimination law question to the justice department is 
simply another delaying tactic in a long line of missed 
opportunities in the war on aids 
we need active federal leadership against discrimination not 
more delay kennedy said 
why are they stalling said rep henry a waxman dcalif 
this administration has done its best to avoid making even a 
single helpful aids decision in the eight years of the reagan 
presidency they handpick a commission and then dont even have 
the courage to accept its recommendations 
we dont need another study waxman said what we need is 
leadership and while surgeon general c everett koop and admiral 
watkins have given that once again the president is hiding 
in new york nan hunter director of the aids and civil 
liberties project of the american civil liberties union suggested 
the president failed to follow the advice of his own commission 
because his administration is so beholden to its own set of 
conservative special interests 
it seems this white house has opted for vindictiveness over 
public health she said 
some opponents to federal antidiscrimination laws for aids 
sufferers argue that such measures would amount to gay rights 
legislation because such a large percentage of people infected with 
the virus are homosexual 
the deadly disease is believed to be spreading most rapidly 
among intravenous drug users who share needles contaminated with 
the hiv virus that causes aids which attacks the bodys immune 
system and leaves victims vulnerable to a wide variety of 
infections and cancers 
the 10point white house plan makes no direct reference to 
restructured leadership of the federal health bureaucracy 
moreover the section on drugs is limited to expressing 
presidential concern 
it said reagan continues his call for bipartisan efforts to 
enact his antidrug proposals 
dr donald ian macdonald a special presidential assistant and 
director of the white house drug abuse policy office was charged 
with reviewing the commissions report and formulating the reagan 
response 
macdonald said the administrations cautious response to the 
commissions call for a drastic increase in drug treatment programs 
to some will seem a bit superficial

a new investment idea from the philadelphia 
stock exchange is being copied in new york and chicago according 
to exchange officials who say they dont like it 
its very frustrating says nicholas giordano president of 
the philadelphia exchange which developed the cash index 
participation product and now finds copies being readied for 
marketing by larger rivals 
its frustrating because being right and being better doesnt 
always count when you are competing with the larger exchanges 
cip was the result of a twoyear 1 million study when the 
philadelphia exchange unveiled it last march and sought securities 
and exchange approval which is still pending 
now the american stock exchange headquartered in new york has 
come up with a similar equity index participation product and the 
chicago board options exchange has proposed its value of index 
participation 
american came up with its eip at the end of april and chicago a 
month later 
the cip product is a security that represents a bet on the 
direction of the overall stock market actually representing a 
share of the value of the standard amp poors 500 stock index 
although not backed up by any real stocks 
the buyer has the right to cash in the contract once each 
quarter for the cash value of the sampp 500 as proposed to the sec 
the contracts would sell at onetenth the value of the sampp index 
and the minimum purchase would be 100 contracts 
there is still confusion as to who should regulate such 
investments the sec reportedly wants to consider them securities 
but the commodities futures trading commission claims they are 
futures contracts which has raised doubt over who will regulate 
them 
ivers riley senior vice president of the american exchange 
admits his eip is identical to the philadelphia product and 
hopes the sec wont give the philadelphia product any edge when 
selling eventually is approved 
riley told the philadelphia inquirer that duplication of 
services is common in the financial industry 
being left at the starting gate is the cardinal sin riley 
said 
giordano however said he thought american wouldnt engage 
in copycattype endeavors adding his exchange is considering a 
copyright infringement lawsuit 
i thought they would be more innovative and come up with their 
own products giordano said 
the chicago board options exchange began developing its vip 
product in 1982 but dropped the idea because the market wasnt 
really ripe for it said cboe spokesman warren moulds 
moulds said the cboe resurrected the vip after the philadelphia 
stock exchange announced plans to launch a similar product he said 
the vip would compete with the cip but would have features that 
represent an improvement over the philadelphia product 
no one is sure how much money the exchanges will make from the 
trading index contracts 
this could be one of the biggest successes of all time or it 
may never get off the ground said giordano there is a 
question of whether people are going to like it or not we have to 
go out and market it educate people and explain how it works 
while the battle is still over whether philadelphia will get an 
advantage with an earlier selling start all three exchanges are 
gearing up for a big advertisement campaign 
well see what happens riley said it looks like its 
building up to be a real interesting dogfight

stock advisory services come and go beaten and 
buried by the vagaries of the marketplace by the unforgiving test 
of time by the egos and emotions of their founders 
it is an old story but with exceptions and this is about one 
of them 
value line founded during the great depression of the 1930s 
persists more than a halfcentury later as the biggest of all 
advisory services claiming 120000 individual and institutional 
subscribers most at 495 a year 
it survives because of the system says samuel eisenstadt 
who helped devise it 
the system is influenced little if at all by preferences or 
notions nobody would dare tamper with it or adjust it to suit a 
whim the system is held sacred it is the founders legacy 
some advisory services rely heavily on the elan of one 
individual but relatively few subscribers knew arnold bernhard 
value lines founder he preferred it that way the system was the 
product 
thus when bernhard died late in 1987 no changes were made in 
the service any more than ford automobiles were redesigned because 
henry ford died or the formula for steel was changed when andrew 
carnegie passed away 
the value line investment survey relies on crosssectional 
analyses of 1700 stocks each measured against others and against 
itself over periods of time to produce a numerical assessment of 
both timeliness and safety 
while bernhard who began the service after losing his job in 
1931 worked relentlessly on his system for the first 15 years it 
has changed little since 1946 
each stocks timeliness score is determined by a history of 
price and earnings for 10 years price momentum or the recent 
action of the stock earnings momentum and an earnings surprise 
factor 
the universe of roughly 1700 stocks is then divided one 
hundred stocks earn a 1 or top rating three hundred stocks 
fall into category 2 more than 800 into category 3 300 into 
category 4 and 100 into 5 the lowest 
safety rankings are another matter entirely determined mainly 
by price stability of the stock and other financial factors many 
stocks earn different ratings for timeliness and safety a safety 
rating of 1 for instance might be accompanied by a 3 for 
timeliness 
eisenstadt who inherited bernhards title of research chairman 
states that the stocks rated highest for timeliness appreciated 
15400 percent from april 16 1965 to june 30 1987 not including 
dividends or transactions costs 
in the same period he states the standard amp poors 500stock 
average rose 245 percent 
it is through measurements of this sort over varying periods of 
time that value line claims to be an anomaly a contradiction of 
the efficient market hypothesis a favorite topic of academics 
in an efficient market so goes the thinking any available 
market information is so quickly reflected in stock prices that no 
attempt to beat the market can be successful in the long run 
value line claims otherwise eisenstadt says the services 
number 1 stock ratings have outperformed market averages for more 
than 21 years showing average annual appreciation of 258 percent 
armed with such data he has often debated the academics and 
sometimes has won concessions from them 
while the system uses complex statistical techniques all the 
information is publicly available if not perhaps easily 
accessible and for those who seek to avoid clutter the numerical 
ratings are amazingly easy to use 
its a concept even children can understand says jean 
bernhard buttner the founders daughter and now president and 
chief operating officer 
anyone who can count to five can easily and profitably use the 
system

a bilingual magazine called the emigrant was 
unveiled by publishers seeking to make a profit from the huge 
number of people seeking to leave this british colony before china 
takes over in 1997 
wednesdays launching of the monthly magazine is the latest sign 
of the colonys growing brain drain in which swarms of hong 
kongs brightest people pessimistic about the future under chinese 
rule are moving overseas 
the government does not keep emigration statistics but the 
annual figure is in the tens of thousands including many business 
professionals who meet immigration requirements of countries such 
as australia and canada 
richard day publications director of the magazine told a news 
conference that immigration statistics from consulates and 
conversations with government officials indicate that more than 
50000 hong kong residents would emigrate this year with even more 
leaving in 1989 
the chineseenglish magazine which costs 20 hong kong dollars 
an issue or about 250 is not designed to encourage emigration 
but merely presents unbiased facts about topics such as living 
abroad permanently day said 
the first issue which will hit newsstands monday has articles 
on the overseas real estate market education counseling 
restaurants in australia and the method used by canada to determine 
immigration eligibility

washingtons insurance commissioner has 
rejected an unfriendly takeover bid for farmers insurance group by 
the british conglomerate bat industries plc 
the policyholders could quite possibly lose from the 
acquisition and they do not stand to gain anything from it 
commissioner dick marquardt said in an order turning down the bid 
on tuesday 
marquardts spokesman ed ives said the company was expected to 
appeal the decision 
washington joins oregon idaho and california in rejecting the 
45 billion or 63 per share takeover bid arizona has approved 
the offer made through bats american subsidiary batus inc 
decisions are pending in illinois ohio kansas and texas 
the commissioners ruling followed almost a week of hearings in 
seattle last month 
farmers insurance co of washington based in vancouver and 
farmers new world life headquartered on mercer island are 
affiliates of farmers insurance group of los angeles which has 
rejected the batus offer 
the interests of farmers policyholders shareholders and the 
general public are best served by farmers remaining independent 
said leo e denlea jr chairman and chief executive officer of 
farmers 
farmers is the no 1 auto insurance company in the state 
writing 174 percent of the policies in the market marquardt said 
marquardt said he did not believe batus claims that it would not 
change farmers operations if it was successful in acquiring the 
insurance company 
simply by virtue of the change in control different 
individuals would be in ultimate control of the two washington 
domestic companies the order said those individuals are bound 
to have different ideas about where the companies should be going 
and how they should get there 
marquardt said his decision was based partly on the greater 
likelihood that batus would drop nonsmoker discounts on auto and 
homeowner policies and medical malpractice coverage now offered by 
farmers 
batus vice president wilson wyatt said however the company 
does not plan to change farmers operations 
our sworn testimony was that we have no intention of 
discontinuing either smoker or nonsmoker discounts or hospital 
professional liability policies he said 
wyatt said batus would be able to satisfy marquardts concerns 
marquardt noted that batus has substantial holdings in the 
tobacco industry it owns brown amp williamson tobacco corp and 
that a takeover would cause some degree of tension between 
sister subsidiaries that could result in canceling the special 
rates 
should that happen there would cease to be any competition in 
those lines of coverage based on the smokernonsmoker distinction 
as no other companies offer such a discount in those lines the 
order said

deere amp co and the united auto workers 
sat down at the bargaining table today to begin negotiating a new 
labor contract 18 months after the end of a bitter 163day strike 
uaw president owen bieber and union secretarytreasurer bill 
casstevens shook hands with hans w becherer deere president and 
michael s plunkett a senior vice president to raise the curtain 
on negotiations over a contract to replace the current 20month 
agreement that expires at midnight sept 30 
the two sides made their initial presentation at the traditional 
meeting site of a union hall and will move to a neutral site for 
negotiations 
im always excited and im always optimistic at the start of 
talks bieber said ive been reading analysts reports that 
say deere has been making money and their stock is going up it all 
looks very encouraging and they need to recognize the need to 
share that with their employees 
the talks cover about 13400 active employees and 4000 
laidoff workers at 11 cities in illinois iowa minnesota 
colorado and georgia deere employs about 38000 employees 
worldwide 
over the next two months the bargaining teams will discuss such 
issues as restoration of wage cuts pension increases job 
security farmingout of work to outside contractors and worker 
retraining 
the average deere factory worker makes 1547 per hour or 
32177 annually and the company calculates its labor costs at 
2690 per hour including vacation bonuses holidays and other 
fringe benefits 
before the start of negotiations spokesmen for both sides 
declined specific comment on the issues saying they would do their 
talking behind closed doors at the bargaining table 
deere amp co is looking forward to the upcoming meetings with 
the uaw we expect to reach an agreement that satisfies the 
requirements of deere and its uawrepresented employees said g 
bart bontems director of industrial relations for the company 
high priority goals in the bargaining with deere amp co will be 
to strengthen the security of jobs and incomes of uaw members 
bieber said last week 
molinebased deere leads the nation in farm tractor and 
agricultural implement manufacturing and is a major competitor in 
the industrial equipment market 
but the company is recovering from a prolonged farm belt 
recession and years of labor turmoil including a fivemonth strike 
in 198687 the longest in the companys 151year history 
the 163day work stoppage at 13 deere plants in illinois iowa 
minneapolis georgia tennessee and colorado ended feb 1 1987 
when union workers accepted a wage freeze a onetime payment of 
735 each and creation of a job protection plan 
deeres earnings collapsed and the company racked up 328 
million in losses in two years for the sixyear period of 198287 
deeres operating losses totaled 637 million 
a program of cost cutting layoffs and a turnaround in the 
agricultural sector helped deere return to the black and analysts 
projected earnings of more than 200 million in the 1988 fiscal 
year which ends oct 30 
but deeres recovery may be stunted by the recent drought which 
has slightly stalled sales of farm tractors the company has 
acknowledged isolated cancellations of farm equipment contracts but 
stands by its sales projections

crop futures opened mixed today in cautious 
trading on the chicago board of trade amid forecasts for an 
increasing chance of showers in the northern corn belt 
wheat and soybean futures prices gained modestly in early 
trading while corn and oats were slightly lower 
analysts said that with the increasing likelihood of rain grain 
and soybean traders were unwilling to bet heavily on declining crop 
yields and rising prices 
nevertheless analysts said corn and soybean crop conditions 
were worsening with each passing day of a scorching heat wave in 
the midwest 
temperatures above 90 degrees were expected to continue into the 
weekend and those forecasts really do indicate the crop is 
deteriorating further especially the soybean crop said walter 
spilka a grain market analyst in new york with smith barney 
harris upham amp co 
the wheat market got a boost from reports that china had 
purchased 500000 metric tons of subsidized us wheat he said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 378 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with september at 299 a bushel oats were 
3 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 284 a bushel and

shoppers walking into the limited store at 
crossgates mall are being greeted by three mannequins crisply 
attired in tailored suits 
is limited more often associated with casual wear going career 
not quite this retailer like many other apparel stores is 
taking on a different look this fall in hopes of reversing a 
yearlong sales slump 
apparel sales began to skid last august as retailers were beset 
by two problems women rebelled against shorter skirts and they 
were turned off by styles that looked too casual too bulky and too 
much like those of past seasons 
fall displays suggest that part of the industrys peace offering 
for the fall is to back off on the skirt issue 
several of the mannequins at limited sport belowtheknee 
skirts while down in manhattan the windows of highfashion stores 
such as bloomingdales bergdorf goodman and saks fifth avenue 
showcase a variety of lengths 
retailers surveyed customers and testmarketed new designs for 
months before coming up with the more tailored and more feminine 
clothes showing up in stores for fall 
the new lines at crossgates apparel retailers show the results 
of their efforts the styles on limiteds suited manneent sale signs 
now said greenstein stores must try to wean customers away 
from markdowns which take a heavy toll on profits it will be 
very difficult to change that he said 
some markdowns are being taken at the start of the season just 
to get traffic started loeb said 
limited is already using the strategy a sign in the window of 
its crossgates mall store offers 10 off on any 50 purchase of the 
stores fall outback red heritage line while the 249 suits 
featured at the entrance all are marked down 50 
wintzer doubted stores would mark down much of their merchandise 
women have still been paying up for what few items have been 
hot he said 
markdowns also may be less likely because the retailers burned 
by the large inventories they were stuck with last fall and spring 
have bought very conservatively for the new season this means 
women who dont shop early may find they cant get what they want 
loeb said 
retailers are willing to forego reordering hotselling items 
and go to the next line he said and advised consumers unless 
you rush in now and buy youll find it will be gone 
analysts watch fashions because their success has a direct 
effect on retailers profits and most stores saw their earnings 
slump during the past year 
now the analysts warn that because last years results were so 
bad a mediocre performance may look better than it really is 
wintzer said a retailer would have to chalk up five or six months 
of doubledigit sales growth for their second half to be considered 
good 
storeowners likely will tout any sales increase but if its 
just a modest improvement its artificial he said

the chicago amp north western transportation co 
said today it expects a strike at midnight disrupting freight 
service in 10 states despite lastditch congressional efforts to 
avert the strike 
the senate approved a joint resolution tuesday to extend a 
coolingoff period in the railroads dispute with the united 
transportation union for 36 days until sept 9 the house has not 
voted on the matter 
we are aware of what the senate did spokeswoman leslie 
cleveland said today from campnw headquarters in chicago but until 
the house takes action we have to go on the assumption that were 
going to implement our work rules and there will be a strike 
the union said it would strike at 1201 am thursday if the 
company a subsidiary of the chicagobased cnw corp carries out 
its threat to cut the size of its train crews in half and eliminate 
hundreds of jobs 
a walkout not only would disrupt freight service but would halt 
operation of campnw commuter trains which carry more than 40000 
passengers daily in the chicago area 
although house leaders had not scheduled a vote on the 
resolution by late morning sen paul simon of illinois was not 
ruling out action before the strike deadline a spokesman for the 
illinois democrat said today 
paul has been meeting with speaker jim wright and other key 
house members and is still hopeful the house might vote today 
spokesman david carle said if not today then tomorrow 
simon said he introduced the measure to see that we avoid what 
will hurt everyone management labor and the whole chicago area 
a spokesman for rep john porter rill was less optimistic 
than simon saying the house probably would not act on the bill in 
time to prevent a walkout 
porters press aide dave kohn said the house leadership had 
not scheduled action on the bill until thursday after the strike 
was to begin 
apparently the leadership does not want to preempt the 
unions right to strike kohn said but if the house acts on the 
bill later thursday he said the strike could be over in a matter 
of hours 
company officials have already said they expect a strike to 
occur even if the coolingoff period is extended president reagan 
had imposed an initial 30day coolingoff period last month 
it definitely appears this is ultimately going to result in a 
strike said james foote an assistant vice president for 
communications of cnw corp no further discussions were held 
tuesday with union officials nor are they planned we made a 
compromise offer yesterday which we thought was extremely 
reasonable and which they rejected 
foote said the company was disappointed by the senate action 
the railroad which has 8000 employees originally proposed 
cutting most of its fourperson train crews in half to save 51 
million a year 
the presidential emergency board proposed eliminating 700 
brakemen jobs instead of the 1150 cuts planned management 
accepted that proposal monday but union officials have rejected 
the offer 
the railroad has said it plans to continue its freight 
operations which are 95 percent of its business in case of a 
strike but expects at least some temporary disruptions 
foote has estimated that the company could operate enough trains 
to generate 80 percent of its normal revenue on the first day of a 
strike

two major unions will be looking for a share 
of the aluminum industrys profits next week when they open early 
negotiations to replace contracts that expire 10 months from now 
the current twoyear pacts with the united steelworkers of 
america and the aluminum brick and glass workers international 
union lowered benefits by 95 cents per hour for their members at 
aluminum company of america and reynolds metals co 
when we negotiated the current contracts in 1986 our members 
made sacrifices to help the companies over hard time said george 
becker internatinal vice president of the usw now that these 
companies are profitable again our members deserve to share in 
those gains and recover the sacrifices they made 
becker who chairs the unions aluminum industry conference was 
quoted in the usw publication steelabor 
pittsburghbased alcoa the nations largest aluminum producer 
reported profits of 2001 million or 225 per share on sales of 
777 billion for all of 1987 and profits of 4163 million or 
471 per share on sales of 459 billion in the first six months 
of this year 
reynolds of richmond va reported 1987 net earnings of 2195 
million or 433 per share on sales of 432 billion and net 
earnings of 2049 million or 384 per share on revenue of 265 
billion in the 1988 first half 
the contract talks are scheduled to begin aug 8 in cincinnati 
the two unions will conduct concurrent but separate negotiations 
their contracts expire may 31 1989 
the usw said it represents more than 6000 alcoa workers at nine 
locations in the united states and approximately 4000 reynolds 
workers at 21 locations in the united states and canada 
the abgwu represents between 6000 and 7000 alcoa workers and 
an estimated 4700 reynolds workers

business weeks printer fired two more workers 
today and a third printing employee resigned in connection with the 
widening scandal into possibly illegal trading based on leaked 
stock tips from the magazine 
the disciplinary moves by printing giant rr donnelley amp sons 
co of chicago came the same day as the connecticut brokerage 
advest inc announced a broker it had suspended because of the 
scandal resigned 
in addition the us attorney for connecticut confirmed he had 
initiated an inquiry into a network of brokers and printing 
employees who used purloined business week stocktouting inside 
wall street columns to trade the first criminal investigation of 
the scandal since it surfaced two weeks ago 
donnelley one of the nations largerst printers said it had 
fired a previously suspended employee at its torrance calif 
plant and fired another employee at its facility in old saybrook 
conn where a production worker had been dismissed earlier this 
week 
the company also said a torrance worker had resigned in 
connection with its investigation into the leaks 
this is not the way we do business john r walter 
president of the company said in a press statement we have a 
long proud tradition of protecting our customers materials 
though a few employees violated the rules we continue to have 
confidence in our more than 23000 other employees 
nevertheless he said the investigation was continuing and any 
others found to have violated the companys confidentiality rules 
would be dealt with severely 
the company declined to identify any of the affected employees 
earlier today in hartford conn advest spokeswoman martha 
payne announced the resignation of suspended broker thomas griffin 
who had worked at advests office in new london conn 
that resignation brought to three the number of investment 
professionals who have been forced out as a result of queries into 
suspicious business weekrelated trading 
ms payne said griffin who had been with the firm for five 
months tendered his immediate resignation as of late yesterday 
she would not disclose whether griffin admitted involvement in 
the scandal but said he previously had been employed by the 
shearson lehman hutton inc office in old saybrook 
griffin was not in the new london office today and he did not 
return messages left on his home telephone answering machine 
griffins attorney sw bromson was out of the office his 
secretary said 
ms payne said no other advest brokers were under scrutiny but 
she said the firm was continuing to investigate the suspicious 
trading 
hartford us attorney stanley twardy jr meanwhile confirmed 
he had asked the fbi to investigate any possible wrongdoing in 
connecticut in connection with this matter he declined to 
elaborate 
the developments today came two days after donnelley fired a 
production worker at the old saybrook plant for selling copies of 
business week to william dillon a merrill lynch broker who was 
fired last week 
people familiar with the investigation have said dillon bought 
them for as little as 20 each and used the information to make 
profits of 2000 a week or more 
prudentialbache securities inc also has dismissed a broker in 
connection with the scandal brian callahan from its office in 
anaheim calif not far from donnelleys torrance plant 
at least nine securities firms have become enmeshed in the 
scandal which first surfaced july 21 when business week the 
nations leading business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 
million disclosed it was investigating suspicious trading of 
stocks mentioned in inside wall street before the magazine was 
publicly available 
the securities and exchange commission and the nations major 
stock exchanges also are probing trades of stocks mentioned in the 
column such activity is regarded as fraud under federal securities 
laws 
a report in the new york times today quoted unidentified sources 
as saying an unnamed california investor who reportedly holds seven 
trading accounts at varying brokerages is under investigation in 
the scandal as well that report could not be immediately confirmed

the first word came in a japanese financial 
newspaper in january hiroshi maeda of the university of tokyo had 
found a superconductor that broke all previous temperature records 
while legions of physicists struggled to decipher the japanese 
and to duplicate maedas feat two newcomers at the university of 
arkansas announced they had smashed his record 
a few days later ibm scientists fiddling with the arkansas 
superconductor in san jose calif hit a hightemperature mark 
that still stands 
all the pandemonium began with the january 1986 discovery by two 
ibm scientists in zurich switzerland that a complicated mixture 
of lanthanum barium copper and oxygen could carry electricity 
with no resistance at 396 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
in the exotic landscape of physics that was terribly warm 
before the zurich oxide as its sometimes called 
superconductors worked only at temperatures colder than minus 418 
degrees about 42 degrees above absolute zero 
the ibm discovery impressed the stockholm crowd the scientists 
k alex mueller and j georg bednorz received the 1987 nobel prize 
one of the fastest on record 
superconductivity almost seems to violate natures laws when 
electricity passes through ordinary conductors some is inevitably 
converted into heat sometimes a lot of it as in your toaster 
but not in superconductors they carry electricity with no 
resistance and no heat loss none 
thats more than a scientists idea of a parlor trick these 
brittle ceramic metals could lead to zeroresistance electric power 
lines exotic energy storage devices and other wonders and no 
story on superconductivity would be complete without a mention of 
superfast trains magnetically levitated over superconducting rails 
the truth is no one is quite sure where and when 
superconductors will turn up outside physics labs economists may 
be better forecasters than physicists 
maglev trains might work in lab tests but who will pay to 
build them are utilities going to rip out serviceable power lines 
to put up superconductors not if they have to double or triple 
your electric bill to pay for it 
president reagan told a conference last year there are 
predictions of highspeed trains levitated above their tracks 
supercomputers on a single silicon chip cheaper and more effective 
medical imaging devices 
reagan said its our business to discover ways to turn our 
dreams into history as soon as possible but he wont foot the 
bill either the national science foundation budget for 
condensedmatter physics which includes superconductivity is 
372 million this year up just 05 percent 
such worldly concerns aside physicists are silly with 
excitement 
somebody described scientists like pigeons said brian 
schwartz a physicist at brooklyn college of the city university of 
new york you throw bread here and everybody pecks here then you 
throw bread over there and everybody pecks there 
the record holders are the ibm researchers led by paul grant 
who pushed the threshhold to 234 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
grant and company surpassed the report by maeda of 
superconductivity onset at minus 243 degrees maeda started with 
copper oxide or copper and oxygen the common denominators in 
nearly all the new superconductors and added bismuth strontium 
and calcium 
earlier compounds had contained yttrium instead of bismuth 
physicists soon were wearing buttons that read sell yttrium buy 
bismuth 
the last 18 months have been the most exciting in my life 
grant said at the march meeting of the american physical society in 
new orleans a year after the socalled woodstock of physics in 
new york 
that was when most physicists got their first reports on the new 
superconductors that was a onceinalifetime event it was 
incredible incredible what else can i say said grant echoing 
others who were there 
a woodstock ii session was held this year with late reports 
on the superconductors discovered in tokyo and arkansas 
one of the stars was arkansas allen hermann he and zhengzhi 
sheng discovered the thalliumbariumcopperoxygen superconductor 
to which they later added calcium that holds the high temperature 
record set by grant 
hermann and sheng reported superconductivity at minus 238 
degrees earning them a momentary record until grant pushed their 
compound further they since have matched his mark 
how high the temperature record will go is anybodys guess 
scattered reports of superconductivity at room temperature havent 
been confirmed but many researchers believe roomtemperature 
superconductivity may be possible 
not all the action is in the glamorous search for new 
superconductors and the race for higher temperatures however 
theorists the armchair physicists whose job is to think not to 
concoct think they are beginning to understand how the new 
superconductors work 
the key seems to be the arrangement of the copper oxide 
electron microscopes have shown that the copper and oxygen atoms 
arrange themselves in planes the other elements serve as spacers 
sandwiched between the planes 
in some compounds each plane is separated from its neighbors 
in others the planes are paired and in the newest the planes occur 
in threes 
the more planes the higher the temperature at which 
superconductivity occurs at the moment thats a mere observation 
if we can go to four layers we should be able to go to higher 
transition temperatures said robert hazen of the geophysical 
laboratory of the carnegie institution of washington dc 
the next question to be addressed is why it should be so but 
physicists at last have a direction to go thats more than hunch 
which is how they got where they are anyone can do it melt a few 
elements together let the stew harden cool it to frigid 
temperatures and see what happens 
hazen calls that shake and bake science or cook and 
look 
of course not everything is as simple as stacking planes just 
when physicists had become comfortable thinking about planes a 
superconductor with no stacked planes was discovered the mixture 
of potassium barium bismuth and oxygen became superconducting at 
about 406 degrees below zero according to its discoverers at 
atampts bell laboratories 
its not a contender in the hightemperature race but paul 
fleury one of the discoverers said theres a whole new 
ballfield thats opened up now 
on another ballfield stuart wolf of the naval research 
laboratory in washington dc has produced a 
lanthanumcopperoxygen superconductor with a simpler structure 
but similar to the other coppercontaining superconductors 
its a kind of superconductor building block and wolf believes 
its a contender he thinks it could go superconducting at higher 
temperatures than hermanns thallium mix and hes out to prove it 
his first tests show superconductivity at minus 280 degrees 
fahrenheit but hes betting he can reach a toasty 100 degrees 
below zero 
there is a catch wolfs simple superconductor isnt simple to 
make it must be cooked at 2700 degrees fahrenheit and squeezed at 
65000 times normal atmospheric pressure fortunately for wolf 
once the material is made it can be cooled and studied at normal 
temperatures and pressures 
natures been kind its done something we never expected 
said schwartz we never thought wed be operating at these 
temperatures in our lifetime or ever

a series of stock scandals has prompted the 
government to hasten its control over insider trading in japan 
where privileged information has been a traditional feature of the 
securities trade 
finance ministry officials said wednesday a new law giving 
authorities greater investigatory and surveillance powers over 
stock deals could be gradually implemented as early as this month 
criminal punishment clauses will take effect next april 
officials in the ministrys securities bureau said the measures 
were to be implemented in gradual steps beginning nov 1 
although the officials gave no reasons for moving up enactment 
of the revised securities and exchange law japans first to 
directly address insider trading securities and legal experts 
said growing public attention on recent stock scandals spurred the 
decision 
the most famous of these recruitgate has been the subject 
of intense parliamentary debate in recent days aides to top 
politicians including prime minister noboru takeshita reportedly 
bought shares of the recruitcosmos real estate firm before public 
trading began and made substantial profits when prices rose later 
there is wide skepticism about any real impact the new 
legislation may have on insider trading which experts describe as 
common in japanese stock dealings 
brokers routinely advise clients on stock deals based on inside 
information and frequently use the information in their own 
transactions companies inform corporate shareholders in advance 
about announcements that may affect share prices in order to 
maintain good business relations 
i cant say the new law will have an overnight impact on 
insider trading in japan where most stock dealings are more or 
less based on inside information said keisuke matsuura a 
private investor who has followed the tokyo stock market for more 
than 30 years 
but at least people who are unconsciously indulging in insider 
trading today wont be able to get away by saying gee i didnt 
know it was insider trading after the law is implemented he 
said 
legal experts expressed concern about the governments 
involvement in investigating and monitoring stock deals 
the finance ministry is not an independent body like the 
securities and exchange commission in the united states which is 
free from all political obligations and there is no guarantee its 
regulation wont be affected by political interests said hiroshi 
itakura a criminal law professor at nihon university 
we can probably expect the ministry to pinpoint minor insider 
trading cases but i cant believe it would attack cases involving 
top politicians 
experts said securities regulatory authorities the finance 
ministry and the tokyo stock exchange need the greater 
investigatory and surveillance functions even if only to send a 
message 
the tokyo stock market has been rocked by a series of scandals 
in recent months despite public outcry for stringent measures to 
regulate insider trading the finance ministry has not been able to 
bring criminal charges against players in any of the controversies 
between october 1986 and september 1987 the tokyo exchanges 
dealing review section investigated 252 transactions it deemed 
suspicious but failed to prove any criminal wrongdoing 
the move toward tougher controls was spawned last september in 
a widely publicized case an osakabased bank sold large stock 
holdings in a chemical company shortly before it was announced the 
company had suffered huge losses in stock speculations no criminal 
punishment was meted out despite the disclosure that the hyogo sogo 
bank knew about the losses in advance 
at the urging of the us securities and exchange commission 
the finance ministry in february agreed to implement stiffer laws 
to control fraudulent stock activities 
sec chairman david ruder who was visiting tokyo in february 
said then the legislation covered 98 percent of what the us law 
covers parliament approved it in may and it was slated for 
gradual enactment beginning in november 
revelations of the recruitcosmos deals broke early this summer 
and quickly escalated into a scandal and while parliament debated 
the ethical aspects of that case last week stock watchers noted 
the share price of the tokyo precision machinery firm sankyo seiki 
skyrocketed shortly before the announcement of its corporate tieup 
with nippon steel co 
experts said there was a leak but tokyo stock exchange chairman 
michio takeuchi said it will be difficult to verify wrongdoing 
kyodo news service reported wednesday that exchange officials 
strongly suspected questionable transactions took place 
finance ministry officials said they were awaiting the results 
of the exchanges probe and would take appropriate measures

the top negotiator for the striking film and 
tv scriptwriters was expected to recommend approval of the 
producers latest offer proposed today after allnight talks a 
union bargainer said 
writers guild of america chief negotiator brian walton was to 
present the contract to the unions full negotiating committee a 
favorable vote could effectively end the strike that has paralyzed 
the entertainment industry for 22 weeks 
its my expectation that he is going to recommend that we go 
with this said arthur sellers a member of the wga negotiating 
committee 
there was no immediate word on the contents of the proposed 
contract 
formal approval would require a vote by the full membership of 
the union membership meetings which require a 48hour advance 
notification could be held as early as friday with the vote tally 
announced the following day 
a highly placed guild source speaking on condition of 
anonymity confirmed that walton was expected to recommend approval 
the committee planned to meet with alliance of motion picture 
and television producers representatives an hour later and a wga 
board meeting was scheduled for later today at guild headquarters 
in west hollywood 
the 9000 film and tv scriptwriters went on strike march 7 over 
payments for reruns and syndication of tv shows 
the strike cut short last years tv season and suspended 
production of countless series and movies it has forced the 
networks to scramble to fill their fall lineups with specials 
movies and remakes of old series 
asked if a settlement was possible as he left the allnight 
bargaining session about 630 am walton said its possible 
its always been possible 
im not unhappy with what happened tonight well just see 
what happens when we come back walton added 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg and wga president george kirgo 
did not immediately return calls seeking comment 
the two sides adjourned this morning after holding informal 
talks for more than 12 hours at alliance headquarters in sherman 
oaks 
the 21member dissident writers coalition which has threatened 
to break from the guild to return to work announced it will honor 
the walkout but will again consider resigning if the strike 
continues past this week spokesman lionel chetwynd said 
barry diller head of 20th century fox said his studio will pay 
any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who cross picket 
lines 
guild fines against strikebreaking writers are set at 110 
percent of all compensation received for unauthorized strike work 
and violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild ms 
rhoden said

flight attendants at eastern airlines fighting to 
save more than 1000 jobs on wednesday proposed a twotiered 
workreduction scheme they say would save eastern 15 million 
annually and let them stay on the carriers payroll 
mary jane barry president of the transport workers unions 
miami branch said a survey of 1000 eastern flight attendants 
showed that senior attendants were willing to share weekly work 
schedules cutting their working time and pay in half 
hundreds of others ms barry said would accept longterm 
leaves from active service while remaining employees of the 
financially troubled airline which is a subsidiary of giant texas 
air corp 
the union was excited about the plan we had developed she 
said adding our plan could enable eastern to avoid laying off 
one single flight attendant 
ms barry said similar programs have operated successfully at 
other airlines including pan am american republic and ozark 
since the early 1980s 
the transport workers proposal came 10 days after eastern 
president phil bakes announced that the airline would eliminate 
4000 jobs and cut service to 14 cities in a move to bring the 
carrier back into the black 
the labor plan also came a week after eastern management 
rejected a similar proposal from the flight attendants for massive 
longleave agreements 
mr bakes would rather lay off the 1000 flight attendants 
than save millions at eastern ms barry told a news conference 
eastern had a net operating loss of 182 million last year and 
the job cuts if carried out would bring the airlines total staff 
to 29521 down sharply from the 43308 people employed by the 
carrier in september 1986 
ms barry said the union filed a suit tuesday seeking a 
temporary restraining order to block easterns layoff proposal 
on july 28 the machinists union which represents about 12000 
eastern employees filed a lawsuit in us district court in 
washington seeking a preliminary injunction or a temporary 
restraining order against the planned layoffs 
charles bryan president of the machinists local in miami said 
managements proposed cutbacks will significantly increase 
easterns recurring losses and lead to the ultimate destruction 
of the carrier 
bryan charged that eastern was in violation of the railway labor 
act with the layoff plan asserting that the program amounted to 
an act of selfhelp for texas air 
the eastern cutbacks he argued would benefit continental 
airlines another texas air subsidiary 
according to bakes the cutbacks were unavoidable because of 
easterns losses 
in essence he said eastern is returning to its basic 
roots in an attempt to regain strength in the marketplace 
under the management proposal eastern would concentrate on its 
service to boston new york washington atlanta and miami 
dropping kansas city mo as its western hub

grain and soybean futures closed mixed wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade as fears of rain offset the bullish 
impact of the cropwilting heat hovering over the farm belt 
wheat finished higher soybeans were mixed and corn and oats 
closed mostly lower 
the market is still trying to sort itself out over the fact 
that the weather has been pretty severe this week said ted mao 
grain specialist in new york with shearson lehman hutton inc 
analysts said crop conditions were deteriorating because of the 
intense dry heat but mixed weather forecasts made traders were 
unwilling to bet heavily on declining crop yields and higher prices 
i can find you any forecast you want from a good rain outlook 
over the next 24 to 48 hours to a poor rain outlook mao said 
its all a matter of individual meteorologists interpretations 
of computer models 
wheat prices advanced on news that china had purchased 500000 
metric tons of subsidized us wheat analysts said 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 381 a bushel corn was 3 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 298 a bushel 
oats were 5 cents to 7 cents lower with september at 283 a 
bushel and soybeans were 5 cents lower to 7 cents higher with 
august at 836 a bushel

droughtdamaged grain harvests in the united 
states canada and china will produce the steepest oneyear drop in 
world grain stocks ever recorded a private research organization 
predicted wednesday 
the worldwatch institute said the drought will reduce the us 
grain harvest this year by about 78 million metric tons from 1987 
with damage to canadas crop adding 11 million tons to the decline 
in china which ranks a close second to the united states as a 
food producer severe drought conditions could reduce the grain 
harvest by 30 million tons the report said 
even with offsetting harvest increases in india the soviet 
union and the european continent of about 45 million tons the 
world grain harvest could drop by 74 million tons below output for 
1987 which was 85 million tons below the preceding year 
carryover grain stocks at the end of 1988 total supplies 
remaining when the new harvest comes in could fall to 54 days of 
world consumption the institute said this would be lower than the 
57day level that more than doubled world grain prices in 1973 it 
said 
the lack of rainfall is contributing to what will almost 
certainly become the steepest oneyear drop in world grain stocks 
ever recorded said the report written by institute president 
lester r brown a former administrator of the agriculture 
departments international agricultural development service 
brown said the drought damage coincides with a marked slowdown 
in world grain production attributed to depressed grain prices 
land shortages soil erosion scarcity of fresh water and the lack 
of new technologies for boosting output 
he said growth in food production has fallen behind population 
growth in africa and latin america the two continents with the 
fastest population increases 
future improvements in the world food prospect depend on 
reversing land degradation and putting the brakes on population 
growth brown wrote 
without a massive reordering of priorities that will restore 
soils and slow the population growth that is already outstripping 
food production on two continents food scarcity and higher food 
prices may well dominate the nineties he said

international business machines corp committed 
itself wednesday to achieving market leadership in workstations 
the speedier siblings of personal computers that make up one of the 
fastestgrowing parts of the computer business 
our strategy hasnt been competitive today it is our 
objective is to be the leader in the industry for workstations by 
1991 ibm spokeswoman linda dezan said 
ms dezans comments based on the official ibm position were 
an expansion of remarks by ibm executive arthur g goldberg that 
were quoted in wednesdays editions of the wall street journal 
workstations are expensive desktop computers that are typically 
used for work that requires intensive manipulation of numbers or 
sophisticated graphics such as science engineering design and 
financial modeling 
ibms rt workstation was widely faulted for being underpowered 
and lacking in software when it was introduced in early 1986 and 
sales lagged badly but ms dezan said ibm has steadily added 
software while doubling the performance of the rt every 12 to 18 
months 
ibm had 39 percent of the worldwide market for workstations 
used for science and engineering last year trailing sun 
microsystems incs 29 percent share apollo computer incs 21 
percent digital equipment corps 20 percent and hewlettpackard 
cos 12 percent according to international data corp 
those numbers understate the rts popularity because they focus 
only on machines used for science and engineering about half the 
rts sold are used for general corporate business 
goldberg said a version of the rt that will be available 
relatively soon will be at least twice as fast as current models 
for generalpurpose computing and many times as fast for 
engineering and design work 
ibm has devoted a huge effort to improving the rt because 
workstations are a booming segment of the computer industry with 
industrywide sales growing 30 percent a year 
june was the best month yet for rt sales because of improvements 
already made in the product ibm says the rt will get another 
boost from the 36 billion contract ibm recently won from the 
federal aviation administration for an airtrafficcontrol system 
that system will be largely based on the rt and will include 12000 
to 15000 rts 
we have been experiencing much more success with the rt than 
weve generally been given credit for ms dezan said 
ibm says it is spending as much money on development of rt 
hardware as on hardware for its huge personal computer business in 
addition it is increasing the number of marketing people for the 
rt tenfold to at least 300

four more people lost their jobs wednesday 
because of suspected insider trading on swiped tips from 
unpublished copies of business week and a us attorney announced 
the first criminal probe into the scandal rr donnelley amp sons 
co one of the companies that prints the business weekly said it 
fired two workers and another quit the investment firm advest inc 
said a broker suspended because of business weeklinked trading 
resigned 
the developments raised to seven the list of brokers and 
printers forced out of their jobs because of the scandal in which 
an undetermined number of people traded stocks based on stolen tips 
from the business magazines inside wall street stocktouting 
column prior to publication 
buying and selling stocks based on information unavailable to 
everyone is commonly referred to as insider trading and is 
considered fraud under federal securities laws 
donnelley said it fired a previously suspended employee at its 
plant in torrance calif and another worker there resigned the 
company also said it fired a second worker at a printing plant in 
old saybrook conn where a production employee was dismissed 
earlier this week 
this is not the way we do business john r walter 
donnelley president said in a statement from the companys 
headquarters in chicago 
we have a long proud tradition of protecting our customers 
materials he said although a few employees have violated our 
rules we continue to have confidence in our more than 23000 
donnelley employees we are continuing our investigate and we will 
deal severely with any individuals involved 
donnelley officials declined to name the employees affected in 
the latest action but confirmed the identity of the old saybrook 
worker fired earlier as william rady who was said to live in the 
new london area directory assistance said there was no residential 
telephone listing under that name 
the printing company has said it is considering unspecified 
legal action against the disciplined workers 
evidence uncovered so far in the scandal suggests some printers 
distributed or peddled unpublished copies of business week to 
brokers who bought stocks recommended by inside wall street 
and sold them later at a profit after publication had attracted 
more buyers and raised the price of the stocks 
stanley twardy jr the us attorney in hartford conn said 
he had asked the fbi to investigate any possible wrongdoing in 
connecticut in connection with this matter he declined to 
elaborate on the nature or scope of the probe the first criminal 
inquiry since the scandal surfaced late last month 
last week merrill lynch amp co fired a broker from its new 
london conn office near donnelleys old saybrook plant and 
prudentialbache securities inc fired a broker from its anaheim 
calif branch near the torrance plant merrill lynch also is 
investigating a second broker 
advest spokeswoman martha payne said wednesday that broker 
thomas griffin who had worked at the firms new london office and 
was suspended last week had resigned 
she would not disclose whether griffin admitted involvement in 
the scandal but said he previously had been employed at the 
shearson lehman hutton inc office in old saybrook 
griffin was not in the new london office wednesday and he did 
not return messages left on his home telephone answering machine 
griffins attorney sw bromson was said to be out of the office 
and did not return messages 
ms payne said no other advest brokers were under scrutiny but 
she said the firm was continuing to investigate the suspicious 
trading 
at least nine investment firms have undertaken internal 
inquiries into trading possibly connected to the purloined tips and 
are known to be cooperating with a securities and exchange 
commission probe of the scandal 
in addition there have been unconfirmed reports that up to two 
dozen investment firms are involved 
the scandal surfaced when business week the nations leading 
business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 million disclosed 
july 21 that it had long suspected prepublication misuse of 
inside wall street tips 
the magazine has been criticized for failing to tell the sec or 
the major stock exchanges about the suspicions earlier business 
week officials have said they were seeking definitive evidence 
before alerting regulatory authorities

opecs pricemonitoring committee 
expressed concern wednesday over a serious deterioration in 
prices due partly to overproducing members but failed to schedule 
emergency talks to address the problem 
meanwhile opec secretarygeneral subroto of indonesia said he 
was optimistic that eventual peace between iran and iraq two major 
gulf oil producers will help the cartel 
with the cessation of the hostilities opec will have a greater 
degree of cohesion that will enable it to more effectively help 
stabilize the oil market subroto told a press briefing after the 
oneday meeting 
in its final communique the pricing committee said it was 
concerned about a serious deterioration in prices since opecs 
last full meeting in june 
it said the problem resulted mainly from the supply overhang 
in the market caused by a significant overproduction in the face of 
huge stock buildups overproduction from some opec members as well 
as highlevel production from nonopec oil producers 
no alleged offenders were named 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries had pledged to 
support an average oil price of 18 a barrel but world market 
prices have fallen below that level 
the fivenation pricing committee comprising oil ministers from 
venezuela nigeria saudi arabia indonesia and algeria met behind 
closed doors at a luxury hotel 
the group reviewed the opec auditors report for the cartels 
may production and estimates from outside sources for june and july 
production 
auditors klynveld kraaijenhof amp co said the 12 opec member 
countries produced 15181 million barrels a day of oil in may up 
from 1486 million barrels a day in april 
the report indicated that production by the all opec members 
rose further during june without giving specific figures for the 
rise 
subroto said he was given a mandate for further consultations 
with all 12 opec member countries on several issues pending for the 
organization ahead of its next ministerial conference scheduled 
for november 
he said he will report on the consultations to the monitoring 
committee which will then decide if an extraordinary conference is 
warranted 
as of now we dont think an emergency meeting is called 
for he said

reversal of a trend that had taken prices to their lowest levels in 
a year 
on other markets crop futures were mixed energy prices fell 
precious metals were higher livestock and meat were mixed and 
stockindex futures advanced 
coffee prices had fallen in five of the six previous trading 
sessions and had just gotten entirely too cheap said bert 
ruiz an analyst with balfour maclaine corp in new york 
the recent selloff was triggered by speculation that disputes 
among the producer and consumer nations in the international coffee 
organization could lead to the collapse of the agreement governing 
trade quotas 
ruiz said such talk wasnt really rational since the 
sixyear ico agreement does not expire until sept 30 1989 
differences among ico members are expected to be aired at an ico 
council meeting next month 
coffee futures also got a boost from the trade bill that was 
headed toward president reagans desk wednesday ruiz said the

that all coffee imported by the united states must carry an ico 
stamp 
the contract for september delivery of coffee settled 937 cents 
higher at 11820 a pound

dry heat of the past four days but mixed weather forecasts made

higher prices 
i can find you any forecast you want from a good rain outlook 
over the next 24 to 48 hours to a poor rain outlook said ted 
mao grain specialist in new york with sheason lehman hutton inc 
its all a matter of individual meteorologists 
interpretations of computer models he said 
after the close the national weather service issued a 
sixto10day forecast calling for very hot mostly dry conditions 
in the midwest during the five days beginning next tuesday 
wheat prices advanced on news that china had purchased 500000 
metric tons of subsidized us wheat analysts said the 
agriculture department announced another 500000ton chinese wheat 
purchase after the close 
wheat settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher with september at 380

with products outpacing crude oil in a volatile session marked by 
the markets attention to opec developments

announcement from the opec pricing committee meeting in lausanne 
switzerland 
but when the meeting ended opec secretarygeneral subroto 
announced no new plans to lower crude oil production and raise 
pricers and futures prices plunged 
the market just tanked and buyers were running and hiding

lower with september at 1526 a barrel heating oil was 124 cents

technical factors while hogs futures prices fell due to 
heavierthanexpected cash sales and expectations that producers 
would continue to move hogs to market despite the extreme heat 
analysts said 
live cattle were 35 cent to 80 cent higher with august at 
6585 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent to 125 cent

coastal corp and a governmentowned chinese 
company announced plans wednesday to form a joint venture for 
ownership and operation of coastals west coast refining and 
marketing properties 
the announcement said coastal signed an agreement tuesday with 
china national chemicals importexport corp also known as 
sinochem in which sinochem will acquire a 50 percent interest in 
the jointventure company for an undisclosed amount of cash 
other chinese companies and investors have interests in american 
real estate but none have bought an interest in oil properties 
said frank knuettel an oil analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
alicia m quijano with the us commerce department declined to 
comment on whether sinochem was indeed the first company from a 
communist country to buy into an american energy company 
david fleischer who follows the refinery industry for 
prudentialbache said he suspected coastal would not disclose the 
purchase amount because it is still negotiating to sell other 
refining ventures most of those negotiations he said are with 
middle eastern countries 
in a july 29 report fleischer said that a sale of a onehalf 
interest in the companys refining assets would likely bring over 
700 million in cash fleischer said wednesday that the newly 
announced agreement would probably amount to less than 20 percent 
of that total 
fleischer also estimated the joint venture would release working 
capital of 40 million to 50 million to coastal 
jim bailey a spokesman for coastal said the money from the 
sale has not been earmarked and would not comment on whether the 
proceeds would go toward coastals goal of paying off debt 
resulting from its 1985 acquisition of american natural resources 
coastal has been saying for some time that it wanted to sell 
half of its refining interests because of the volatility of the 
industry 
but foreign countries are interested in buying refineries in 
the united states and having the final destination of where the 
product goes fleischer said 
coastal operations to be assigned to the joint venture include a 
refinery at hercules calif fuel oil terminals at los angeles and 
coos bay ore and marketing operations at san francisco san 
pedro and long beach calif and portland ore 
we are enthusiastic about this new joint venture which will 
strengthen the tradition of excellent relations between our company 
and sinochem started in 1978 when coastal became the first 
american company to purchase and import crude from the peoples 
republic of china said oscar s wyatt jr coastals chairman 
and chief executive officer 
the joint venture may be the start of a trend for american oil 
companies to sell their interests to foreign countries 
youll see more refinery assets being sold and most buyers 
will be foreign countries fleischer said 
the hercules refinery operated by pacific refining co a 
coastal subsidiary has a refining capacity of 55000 barrels per 
day and storage for 22 million barrels the terminals operated by 
western fuel oil co another coastal subsidiary have a combined 
capacity of 14 million barrels of refined petroleum products 
the memorandum agreement includes plans for capital expenditures 
to upgrade the hercules refinery for expanded production of higher 
octane gasolines and other transportation fuels a crude oil supply 
agreement also will be negotiated between sinochem and the joint 
venture company 
we are pleased with this opportunty to expand our fine 
business relationship with coastal through our investment and 
participation in this new jointventure company said zheng 
dunxun chief executive officer and president of sinochem 
this agreement is also another step forward in sinochems 
continuing efforts to diversify and strengthen its oil markets and 
to expand its worldwide operations 
sinochem is a stateowned international diversified business 
corporation of the peoples republic of china in beijing 
houstonbased coastal is a diversified energy company with total 
assets of 8 billion and operations in natural gas pipelines oil 
and gas exploration and production refining and marketing coal

drought has spread pessimism through parts of the country and 
dragged down a national index of consumers confidence a 
businesssupported research group said wednesday 
in other droughtrelated news grain and soybean futures prices 
finished mixed on the chicago board of trade as predictions of rain 
offset the impact of the cropwilting heat hovering over the farm 
belt 
the worldwatch institute a private research organization said 
drought in the united states canada and china will produce the 
steepest oneyear drop in world grain stocks ever recorded 
on wall street wednesday stock prices edged upward and the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 285 to 213407 
bonds fell in light trading which brokers called a reaction to 
the markets sharp rise earlier this week and investor apprehension 
about an impending government report on unemployment

currencies after giving a mixed performance overseas gold prices

in other economic news car sales rose in late july at ford 
motor co and chrysler corp but fell at general motors corp in 
comparison with a year earlier 
the conference boards consumer confidence index fell in july to 
113 from a revised 1157 in june and a peak of 1202 in may 
despite the decline the index remained well above its recent low 
of 1008 in november the month after the stock market crash 
virtually all of the loss in consumer confidence during the 
last two months can be attributed to the drought fabian linden 
executive director of the boards consumer research center said in 
a prepared statement 
the survey revealed stark regional differences in consumers 
attitudes 
in new england where the economy is strong and the weather has 
been less dry the confidence index rose in july to 1542 from 
1498

general motors corp will make a new 
attack in the warranty wars among automakers with threeyear 
50000mile coverage on most of its 1989 cars and light trucks gm 
president robert c stempel said wednesday 
the change extends gms current 12month 12000mile bumper 
to bumper warranty covering virtually all repairs but drops its 
added sixyear 60000mile coverage on engines and transmissions 
stempel said 
ford motor co and chrysler corp officials did not immediately 
say whether they would follow suit 
stempel told a university of michigan management briefing 
seminars session the new warranties will cover virtually all 
repairs except accident damage including repairs of air 
conditioning steering and suspension systems and electronics and 
power options 
every part is covered from front to back from road to 
roof he said 
in the last round of warranty upgrades gm had announced in 
january it was extending coverage on engines and transmissions to 
six years or 60000 miles 
ford motor co and chrysler corp have 12month or 12000mile 
basic warranties similar to gms both quickly matched gms longer 
engine and transmission warranties 
but stempel said two thirds of those polled in gm customer 
surveys favored the threeyear 50000mile coverage on the entire 
vehicle over the current plan 
gm has offered complete vehicle coverage for three years or 
80000 kilometers 49600 miles on vehicles sold in canada since 
february and canadian customers said they preferred that coverage 
stempel said 
ford will study the gm move spokesman charles l snearly said 
it is always our intention to keep ford and lincolnmercury 
dealers competitive 
for now snearly said we believe our present warranty is a 
good one and serves the customer well our sixyear 60000mile 
power train warranty is comparable to others in the industry 
chrysler officials had no immediate comment on the gm move or 
whether chrysler would follow suit spokesman thomas f houston 
said

twothirds of chief executives of big industrial 
companies say the united states is the worlds technology leader 
but only half expect it to retain the lead by the end of the 
century a new poll says 
fortyfive percent of the more than 120 executives who responded 
to a poll sponsored by research amp development magazine predicted 
japan would be the world leader in technology and research and 
development by the end of the century 
the poll was released by the magazine for publication thursday 
although somewhat gloomy the chief executives were more 
optimistic than a group of top research scientists surveyed earlier 
this year only 48 percent of the scientists said the united states 
was ahead and only 38 percent said it would be ahead by the year 
2000 
the survey results reflect accurately to within 10 percentage 
points the views of all 476 of the chief executives whose companies 
are ranked among the nations 1000 biggest companies the magazine 
said 
about 75 percent of the executives agreed with a statement that 
us companies generally have a shortterm view of research and 
development sacrificing longterm gains for shortterm profits 
nevertheless the survey indicated that growth of spending on 
research and development would slow down at the companies to an 
average annual rate of 113 percent through 1990 in comparison with 
16 percent from 1984 through 1987 
on the question of us leadership 672 percent of the 
executives said the united states leads now while 51 percent said 
it will be the leader in the year 2000

the senate approved and sent to president 
reagan on wednesday a major bill to combat the massive us 
deficits in world trade 
the lawmakers finished work with strong hopes reagan would sign 
the legislation and end three years of wrangling over the issue 
this is a strong bill but not a protectionist bill sen 
john c danforth rmo told the senate before the 8511 vote 
it is designed to enforce the rules of international trade it 
makes american trade policy credible for once 
the bill which followed a torturous course still had one loose 
end dangling even after the senate vote 
the senators planned to take up immediately a resolution that 
would change one provision a feature that increases duty 
freeimports of caribbean ethanol 
if approved by both the house and the senate the resolution 
would instruct congressional clerks to strip the ethanol provision 
out of the bill before sending the measure on to reagan 
earlier senate leaders fought off a swarm of lastminute 
changes proposed by corn growes and others as they hastened to pass 
the bill 
the measure had been dormant on the senate calendar for two 
weeks but was rejuvenated tuesday when reagan said that he would 
not veto a separate piece of legislation requiring companies to 
give employees advance notice of plantclosings and largescale 
layoffs 
if we are going to get this bill and we need this bill we 
are going to have to defeat some of the amendments that are going 
to be offered sen robert packwood rore told the senate 
by wide margins the senate then voted to table or kill 
proposed changes that would have curbed imports of soviet fur 
strengthened presidential control over trade retaliation machinery 
and barred the government from granting preferred trade status to 
the soviet union 
farm lawmakers led by sen charles grassley riowa pleaded 
with the senate to strip from the bill a provision opposed by corn 
growers that would increase dutyfree imports of caribbean ethanol 
ethyl alcohol made from farm goods and mixed with gasoline to 
make the fuel gasohol 
as the afternoon wore on however they indicated they would be 
content with a separate resolution 
it was a convulted finale for what has been one of the most 
complex and snarled issues to face congress in recent years 
the corn growers say much of the caribbean ethanol is merely 
european agricultural goods such as spanish wine reprocessed in 
island refineries and shipped to the united states under dutyfree 
status prescribed by the caribbean basin initiative 
for every job that is created by reprocessing european wine in 
the caribbean basin you can create 100 jobs using corn grown 
by our american family farmers using our own ethanol plants 
grassley declared 
he warned his colleagues they might face campaign ads accusing 
them of voting against the american farmer and the american 
worker 
leaders were trying to bring the much debated 1000page bill 
through the senate exactly as it cleared the house 286136 on july 
13 and send it immediately to president reagans desk 
leaders warned that making changes would propel the measure into 
a housesenate conference committee to resolve differences with 
only 25 legislative days remaining before lawmakers leave 
washington to campaign full time 
at the heart of the bill is a provision that would authorize the 
reagan administration to reach agreements in the current uruguay 
round of world trade talks and guarantee accelerated consideration 
on capitol hill for any deals 
the administrations eagerness to secure such authorization 
figured heavily in reagans decision tuesday not to veto the 
plantclosing legislation 
other key provisions would streamline the machinery under which 
the united states imposes import restraints to protect us 
industry and retaliate against international trade violations and 
other unfair practices 
the bill would step up assistance and retraining of employees 
who lose jobs in layoffs authorizing 80 million for expansion of 
the traditional program and 980 million for a new worker 
readjustment plan 
it would authorize the treasury department to enter negotiations 
to solve third world debt problems the measure contains a 
potential 25 billion in new agricultural subsidies 
the bill bars toshiba corp of japan and kongsberg vaapenfabrikk 
of norway from selling goods to the us government for three 
years the disciplinary action was designed as a response to the 
action of subsidiaries of the two companies in selling 
submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet union 
there are a number of exceptions such as for spare parts 
the subsidiaries would be barred from selling goods commercially 
in the united states and to the government for three years 
under the bill it would become more difficult for prosecutors 
to win convictions against us businessmen for bribes paid by 
their overseas agents to foreign officials the windfall profits 
tax imposed on oilindustry earnings in 1980 would be repealed

striking screenwriters reached tentative 
agreement with motion picture and television producers wednesday 
effectively ending a 150day walkout that paralyzed hollywood and 
left the fall tv schedule in shambles 
it was time to bring it to a conclusion and the deal was 
there brian walton chief guild negotiator said at a joint news 
conference 
we are very pleased to have reached a tentative agreement 
said nicholas counter iii chief negotiator for the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers asked who won counter 
said no one wins a strike 
walton said the agreement reflected some serious bargaining 
members of the writers guild of america were expected to ratify 
the contract at a membership meeting later this week and 
scriptwriters may return to work as early as monday 
thank god isnt that wonderful news were all champing at 
the bit to go back to work said actress betty white the 
emmywinning star of nbctvs the golden girls after she heard 
about the agreement 
writer ic rapoport who wrote the cbs television movie cook 
and peary race to the pole said he was relieved that the 
strike is over and so is my family i can start earning some 
money again 
abc entertainment president brandon stoddard said in a statement 
that settlement of the strike this week would leave his network 
able to premiere most of our fall schedule either before after 
or combined with the miniseries war and remembrance in 
november premiere dates would be announced soon he said 
the settlement announcement ends what had become one of the 
longest and more painful strikes in modern hollywood history 
surpassed only by the wgas 1960 walkout which lasted 23 weeks 
the current walkout began march 7 21 weeks ago 
federal mediator floyd wood said no details of the contract 
would be released until the wgas board of directors on the west 
coast and east coast are informed of the agreement during an 
evening telephone conference call 
the joint boards will then vote via telephone and results will 
be revealed later during a news conference at guild headquarters in 
west hollywood 
it was a fair deal negotiated not dictated and it was 
ok said a member of the negotiating committee who asked not to 
be identified 
news of the settlement came after two days of intense efforts by 
a variety of intermediaries to bring an end to the 22weeklong 
walkout 
final contract details were ironed out at an 12hour meeting 
between walton and counter that ended early wednesday 
the pair who had repeatedly sniped at each other throughout the 
walkout shook hands after the announcement 
as recently as last weekend it looked as though the two sides 
were at an impasse with a producers spokesman saying talks were 
hopelessly deadlocked 
despite the strike settlement the fall television season cannot 
proceed as planned its start will be delayed perhaps until 
november the financial costs to the networks could range into tens 
of millions of dollars 
the wga has 9000 members most living and working in southern 
california the alliance has 217 member companies responsible for 
85 percent of network primetime television and 90 percent of 
feature film production and distribution 
the contract proposal reflects improvements in the foreign 
residual structure and gains in the area of creative rights the 
main issues dogging negotiations said the union negotiator 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg credited the break in the 
stalemated talks to the two federal mediators wood and leonard 
farrell the two had a considerable role in keeping the dialogue 
open he said 
the settlement brings to an end a period of acrimony that has
