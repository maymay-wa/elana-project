defense secretary dick cheney responding to 
concerns that shortrange nuclear missiles could leak plutonium is 
ordering air force bombers to stop carrying older missiles until 
safety studies are completed 
cheney said in a statement friday he was taking the step as a 
precaution 
the directors of three us nuclear weapons laboratories called 
for the withdrawal of the weapons during congressional testimony 
last month they suggested there was a remote possibility the 
weapons could leak plutonium in an accident 
the missiles are known as the shortrange attack missilea or 
sramas and are carried aboard the nations 372 deployed b52 b1b 
and fb111 bombers the air force has said that 1500 of the weapons 
were produced between 1971 and 1975 but the current number deployed 
is classified 
sen james exon dneb chairman of the armed services strategic 
forces subcommittee which heard the lab directors testimony 
agreed with the move 
there was really nothing else the secretary could do said 
exon who was interviewed on cable news network 
cheneys statement said the weapons would not be placed on board 
bombers on ground alert the warplanes that are loaded with 
weapons fueled and ready to fly to war if necessary within 
minutes the number of aircraft on such alert is classified 
the weapons will be removed from the bombers pending the outcome 
of air force and energy department safety studies expected to be 
completed this summer the pentagon statement said the energy 
department is in charge of nuclear weapons 
cheney decided to remove the weapons after discussions with 
energy secretary james watkins the directors of the three 
laboratories and after receiving additional information about 
the srama the statement said it did not elaborate on what that 
information might have been 
the srama is not the only nuclear weapon carried by bombers the 
planes also carry a complement of longerrange nuclear missiles and 
freefall bombs a new model shortrange missile designated sram2 
is under development for deployment in 1993 
the 14foot long srama is an airtosurface missile armed with 
the w69 nuclear warhead with an estimated explosive yield 
equivalent to 170000 tons of tnt which is 11 to 13 times the power 
of the bomb that destroyed hiroshima in 1945 
some nuclear specialists have suggested it would be used against 
targets that threatened the bombers themselves such as radar 
stations fighter bases and antiaircraft missile sites up to 100 
miles away 
the safety of the missile warhead was reviewed in 1989 and 
because of that review some procedures for handling the weapons 
were modified 
the laboratories have initiated new analyses until those 
analyses are complete i believe it is prudent to take this 
action the statement quoted cheney as saying the srama poses 
no safety hazards to the public 
house speaker tom foley dwash called the move correct and 
prudent 
the international strategic conditions have changed 
dramatically in the last year as well and were not in the same 
condition of need for as widespread an alert status as was 
previously the case he added 
in their testimony may 23 the three laboratory directors said 
the missile might be vulnerable to an accidental explosion of the 
missile fuel that could disperse the highly toxic plutonium of the 
weapon 
an accident such as a fire or crash could not detonate the 
plutonium they said 
the directors were john nuckolls of the lawrence livermore 
national laboratory in california sigfried hecker of the los alamos 
national laboratory in new mexico and albert narath of sandia 
national laboratories in new mexico 
the withdrawal of the srama follows cheneys disclosure in late 
may that a safety problem existed with us nuclear artillery shells 
in europe but that it had been fixed and a risk of accidental 
nuclear explosions never materialized

president bush is pledging that a united 
germany will not threaten the soviet union but says he and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl have no specific formula to ensure 
that 
bush and kohl after meeting friday evening continued to insist 
on keeping a unified germany in nato something the soviet union 
strongly opposes and bush said they talked about an expanded 
role for the western alliance in the future 
we also agree that the soviets have understandable interests in 
all of this but we did not try to fashion some compromise at this 
juncture he said in the rose garden where he and kohl took 
questions from reporters 
bush said further consultations will take place before and after 
the july meeting of allied leaders in london 
we will be talking to the other leaders in nato about how we 
lay to rest any concerns that the soviets might have by having an 
expanded role that certainly will be seen to be as unthreatening to 
the soviet union but we had no formula that we agreed on he said 
of his twohour meeting with kohl 
bush and kohl dined at the white house after the president 
returned from a twoday politicking trip to the midwest bush then 
flew to camp david md for a weekend at the presidential 
countryside retreat 
joining them for dinner were vice president dan quayle national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and secretary of state james a 
baker iii baker flew back friday from scotland where he met with 
foreign ministers of 15 allied countries on future security for 
europe and the german question 
baker said in scotland he had found the soviet attitude about 
enrolling a unified germany in nato much more encouraging since 
bushs summit talks with gorbachev last week in washington 
a united germany in nato will not be threatening to the soviet 
union bush vowed friday night a us presence will not be 
threatening to the soviet union so weve just got to keep on making 
our case 
kohl said having germany in nato is of essential importance 
any singling out and neutralization always means isolation 
he added noting that germanys isolation during the 1920s led to 
the chain of events that eventually saw the country divided in half 
after world war ii 
as to the soviet objections that having germany in nato would 
threaten the soviet security kohl held out hope that the roadblocks 
could be solved so that unification talks could be complete by the 
fall 
i never expected this important question could be solved 
overnight he said 
we as germans as a matter of course also are going to bear 
in mind soviet security kohl vowed 
bush who previously called for nato to completely rethink its 
military and political strategy said that such a statementwas 
unlikely to come out of the july nato summit in london 
however he said the allies hope to more clearly define what 
were talking about on the matter of an expanded nato 
he said the meeting would more likely produce a common 
direction for that concept but not one with every t crossed 
and every i dotted 
earlier between stops in the midwest where he stumped for 
gubernatorial and senate candidates bush said he is considering 
breaking off talks with the palestine liberation organization after 
the sheer terror of a thwarted palestinian attack on an israeli 
beach 
in washington a senior administration official said he expected 
a 30day suspension of the talks that began in december 1988 but 
cautioned no final decision had been made 
bush called on plo leader yasser arafat to publicly renounce the 
attack and suggested the continuation of usplo contacts depended 
on arafats response

senate majority leader george j mitchell says 
its no more mr nice guy senators will have to start putting their 
elected noses to the grindstone 
frustrated after a week in which no action was completed on the 
four bills on his menu mitchell threatened friday to crack the whip 
in keeping with the senates leaning toward abundant etiquette 
mitchells warning came after consulting his republican and 
democratic colleagues 
mitchell said hes thinking about putting a stop to fourday 
weekends and shortening the fourweek august recess so senators can 
tend to legislative basics like the budget and defense and farm 
legislation 
the 98000ayear senators may also face the prospect of voting 
in the morning and burning the midnight oil more than one night a 
week mitchell said thursday is the only regular day for latenight 
sessions 
he didnt mention having the sergeantatarms make midnight 
arrests and physically carry reluctant lawmakers to the senate 
floor democrats under former majority leader robert c byrd of west 
virginia resorted to that tactic in february 1988 
were just reaching the point where it is very very difficult 
to move forward on any piece of legislation mitchell said adding 
he was particularly perturbed at a higherthanusual absentee rate 
senators had been asking him to put off important votes while 
they went to graduations to czechoslovakia to monitor elections or 
make their regular weekend visits to home states to meet with 
voters raise money or electioneer 
obviously that circumstance cannot continue mitchell said 
we all have an obligation to conduct the public business 
minority leader bob dole rkan who once had mitchells job 
said forcing a senator to the floor is like leading a horse to water 
it doesnt mean were going to do anything in that time dole 
said explaining that republicans dont share mitchells sense of 
urgency about some of the legislation 
but at least one republican sen nancy kassebaum rkan said 
she was disappointed so few senators were around to vote on an 
amendment she was seeking to protect the general aviation industry 
dole also joked that the public might like having their lawmakers 
as far away from washington as possible 
we cant do anything to them while were home he said

jesse jackson wants mayor marion barry to 
abandon his reelection bid and plans to discuss the mayors 
political future this weekend during a break in barrys cocaine and 
perjury trial sources close to both men say 
the talks will focus on jacksons suggestion that barry abandon 
his reelection plans the sources said friday speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
jackson publicly encouraged barry this week to announce he wont 
seek reelection in an attempt to spur plea bargaining talks that 
would resolve the mayors criminal case which is absorbing the 
capital city 
on friday barry spokeswoman lurma rackley said there is no 
official plea bargaining under way and barry has not made a 
decision on reelection plans 
as for plea bargaining between prosecutors and barrys defense 
lawyer one top city official said no meetings had been set up but 
there is an ongoing dialogue between them he said the situation 
was changing almost hourly 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use 
us attorney jay b stephens wants any bargain to include a 
guilty plea on a felony charge but the mayor is only willing to 
consider pleading to misdemeanors law enforcement and city 
government sources say 
under federal sentencing guidelines pleading guilty to a perjury 
charge would guarantee that barry would spend time behind bars once 
he entered jail he would be forced to give up the job he has held 
since 1979 
the first week of barrys trial has been taken up with jury 
selection which is expected to continue all of next week a jury 
will be seated june 18 us district court judge thomas penfield 
jackson said 
the jury pool for barrys trial now stands at 48 
twelve additional jurors were sent into the pool friday and one 
already in the pool was excused 
judge jackson says he plans to go through the remainder of the 
250 people who have filled out questionnaires for the barry trial 
so far the judge and the lawyers in the case have examined some 90 
questionnaires

east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
wants to negotiate compensation for jewish victims of the nazi 
holocaust but his country may not be able to afford the probably 
astronomical cost 
de maiziere plans to meet sunday in new york with representatives 
of the conference on jewish material claims set up in 1951 to 
negotiate reparations for the 6 million jews killed by the nazis an 
official of the world jewish congress said 
the east german compensation could reach into the billions of 
dollars but might be limited by the governments financial 
problems east germany which ended nearly 45 years of communist 
rule in the countrys first free elections last march is reuniting 
with west germany 
the economic union of the two countries is scheduled to be 
completed by july with west germany expected to assume many of its 
financially strapped neighbors liabilities 
under a 1952 agreement west germany has paid more than 40 
billion in reparations to israel to jewish groups and to individual 
claimants 
the luxembourg agreement called for west germany to pay 
twothirds of the total compensation 
but east germanys communist leaders citing the systematic 
persecution of communists by the nazis refused to recognize any 
responsibility or to pay the remaining third of the claims after 
world war ii east germany was dominated by the soviet union which 
had lost at least 20 million lives to the nazis 
one of the first acts of the new democratic east german 
parliament was to concede a share of the blame for the nazis deeds 
in a letter to wjc president edgar bronfman de maiziere said he 
would be grateful if you were to initiate soonest 
conversations with east german government experts in which a 
settlement of the jewish claims would be agreed on within the 
framework of our possibilities 
a copy of the letter was made available to the associated press 
de maizieres request to start negotiations is historic in that 
it fulfills a pledge of the new government to assume moral 
responsibility for the crimes of the germans against the jews 
said wjc executive director elan steinberg 
he said the meeting sunday between de maiziere and the claims 
body would be preliminary and would set up future negotiating 
sessions 
de maiziere heads for washington monday to meet with president 
bush the first white house meeting between an east german prime 
minister and a us president

about 7400 riders on two maryland commuter lines were forced to 
find other ways to and from their jobs in washington dc on

federal court hearing

electrical workers when it announced a furlough last week of 45 
employees including the crane operators at a train yard in

congress should help in disciplining and 
weeding out bad physicians by making doctors more accountable to 
their state licensing boards rep ron wyden says 
the oregon democrat endorsed the recommendations of an inspector 
generals report saying hell introduce legislation to force 
federally supported peer review groups to give state medical boards 
information about their investigations of doctors 
too many incompetent physicians can slip through the 
disciplinary net and continue to inflict bad medical care on 
patients for extended periods of time he said 
the peer review organizations study complaints about physicians 
who receive money from medicare 
but little of that information is passed along to boards that 
license doctors and investigate complaints about their practices 
witnesses told the house small business subcommittee on regulation 
richard kusserow inspector general for the department of health 
and human services said the review organizations have lots of 
information about bad doctors but are unwilling to share much of it 
because they fear legal retribution

a bruised rep gerry studds dmass thanked 
the quick action of passersby for saving him from more serious 
injury in a sidewalk attack investigators were seeking a motive in 
the case 
studds rested in his provincetown mass summer home today 
recovering from cuts and bruises inflicted by two men who beat him 
up on a washington street corner early friday 
four pedestrians saw the assault and chased away the attackers 
but studds had already been knocked down and beaten said steven 
schwadron a spokesman for the nineterm democrat 
the witnesses were really phenomenal schwadron said what 
they did is what convinced the guys to flee 
the passersby flagged down a us secret service car that 
happened to be driving through the area a short time later two 
uniformed agents arrested the suspects who had blood on their hands 
and clothing the secret service said the suspects later admitted to 
the beating 
gerry was mugged and beaten up pretty bad but the bottom line 
is hes ok schwadron said 
the attackers knocked studds down then punched and kicked him in 
the head and body while a third man egged them on early friday 
according to us attorney jay b stephens 
thomas carter 18 of gaithersburg md and james byrne 19 of 
silver spring md were charged in federal court friday with 
assault on a member of congress with resulting injury the charge is 
a felony that carries penalties of up to 10 years in jail and a 
10000 fine upon conviction 
a third suspect was released because he was not directly involved 
in the beating said secret service officer kevin s porter who 
took part in the arrest 
in a sworn written statement to the court porter quoted carter 
as saying shortly after his arrest it seemed like the thing to do 
at the time once in his cell carter was overheard saying i 
beat up a congressman porter quoted byrne as saying i only hit 
the dude a couple of times 
studds 53 is one of two members of congress who has publicly 
stated that he is homosexual but schwadron said there was no 
indication that was a motive for the attack 
there doesnt seem to have been any clear motive schwadron 
said there was no robbery 
the incident occurred at about 1230 am in the dupont circle 
neighborhood of washington a block from where studds lives 
according to stevens studds office said the congressman was 
returning home alone from dinner at a friends house 
he was treated at the scene by an ambulance crew allan cramer a 
secret service spokesman said 
the attack apparently did not disrupt the congressmans schedule 
schwadron said studds kept an appointment to meet a group of 
students from a cape cod high school on the capitol steps friday 
morning

the hardline policies toward palestinians 
espoused by prime minister yitzhak shamirs new rightwing 
government could worsen already strained relations with the united 
states 
shamir formed his government friday breaking a deadlock that 
began march 15 when the governing coalition collapsed over shamirs 
failure to endorse us proposals for israelipalestinian peace 
talks 
the new government has pledged to expand settlements in the 
occupied lands and use harsh measures to quell the arab uprising 
both moves that could aggravate tensions with washington 
the government which still needs parliamentary approval has 
also ruled out talks with the palestine liberation organization 
which israel views as a terrorist group and any negotiations 
concerning the status of jerusalem which it considers israels 
eternal capital 
washington has pressed for israelipalestinian talks and does not 
recognize israels annexation of arab east jerusalem it has called 
settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip obstacles to 
peace and has called on the israeli army to use restraint in 
supressing palestinian protests 
shamir said friday that his governments main goal would be to 
settle the influx of soviet jews expected to total 150000 this 
year he called the immigration the most important issue we are 
facing today 
the government also pledged to retain its may 1989 peace 
initiative promising palestinians elections but vowed to uproot 
the phenomenon of violence and disturbances a reference to the 
palestinian uprising 
faisal husseini a leading proplo activist in the occupied 
territories said the new government will create more obstacles in 
the way of peace 
i believe this government will try to crush the uprising and 
the uprising will prove there is no way to crush it he said 
but the price will be high 
the rival labor party called the new coalition a government 
whose principles and policies deviate from the interests of israel 
and its citizens the most antiisraeli government that ever arose 
labor leader shimon peres predicted the coalition would be 
plagued by infighting saying most of its time and energy will be 
spent in holding it together peres shamirs rival tried for 35 
days to form a cabinet before surrendering the task to shamir 
shamir telephoned president chaim herzog to report the formation 
of the government just hours before his 42day mandate expired at 
sundown 
a vote in the knesset or parliament could be scheduled as early 
as monday 
in the new government shamirs likud bloc will have full control 
for the first time since 1984 close election results since then had 
forced likud into powersharing arrangements with the leftcenter 
labor party 
the new coalition includes two nationalist parties three 
religious ones two oneman factions and a defector from labor 
under the coalition agreement shamir would have 62 votes in the 
120member knesset but the coalition is shaky and divided prone to 
pressures from some of the eight factions comprising it notably two 
ultraorthodox parties 
the two decisive votes came from the nationalist moledet or 
homeland party which promised to support the government but refused 
to join it one nationalist party within the coalition got the 
freedom to vote as it wants on peace moves 
according to officials in shamirs office key posts in the new 
cabinet went to likud hardliners the most controversial of the 
reported appointments appeared to be that of ariel sharon as 
minister of housing 
sharon was the architect of israels 1982 invasion of lebanon and 
is a strong backer of israels settlement drive asked about moving 
soviet jews to the occupied territories sharon reiterated the 
governments stand that everyone can settle where he wants 
the governments guidelines and the coalition agreement include 
many promises to meet demands of the small parties these included 
legislation banning the sale of pork in line with religious 
commandments and increased observance of the jewish sabbath 
shamir dismissed claims that his government would be subject to 
religious coercion and farright pressures 
this government represents many circles in israel he said 
it is a broadbased nationalistic government it is not rightwing 
and not narrow

american educator thomas sutherland today 
began his sixth year as a hostage and his wife and friends at the 
american university of beirut gathered to mark the grim milestone 
and discuss his life and work 
since sutherland was captured june 9 1985 the only word on his 
condition has come from former hostages who were held with him the 
proiranian group that holds him islamic jihad has never issued a 
photograph of sutherland as it has its other captives 
students and colleagues who gathered friday to mark the 
anniversary of sutherlands captivity recalled his commitment to the 
american university of beirut the scottishborn 59yearold 
educator from fort collins colo was dean of agriculture and food 
sciences at the school when he was kidnapped 
people who have come out from where he is and who have been 
with him say that tom speaks and thinks of aub and wants to come 
back said sutherlands wife jean 
the four things that mean the most to tom are his home his 
family his work and his friends and he found all four of those 
here in beirut and at aub she said she spoke at the lecture hall 
in the universitys agriculture building 
one of those attending was elham cicippio the wife of american 
hostage joseph cicippio who was the acting comptroller at the 
university he was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
in addition to sutherland and cicippio 14 other westerners are 
missing in lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 
16 1985 next to anderson sutherland has been held the longest 
most of the hostages are held by proiranian shiite factions 
mrs sutherland still lives at the american university in moslem 
west beirut continuing the work she and her husband were doing when 
he was abducted 
tom and i are ordinary people she said friday we came 
here to do a job the job is still to be done and were still doing 
it 
she said what her husband is going through is only a 
reflection a shadow of what the people in lebanon have gone 
through in 15 years of civil war 
we hope that when he comes out it means reconciliation it 
means that people are not divided that people are on their way to 
work together in peace and harmony she said

he said if im going to be afraid id better not be there

a federal judge rejected manuel noriegas claim that 
the united states has no jurisdiction to indict him on charges he 
trafficked drugs as panamas leader 
in a second blow friday to noriegas legal defense a 
codefendant in a parallel tampa indictment named the ousted 
panamanian dictator as a silent partner in a drug ring 
in miami us district judge william hoeveler rejected defense 
claims that noriega had immunity for his actions and could not be 
prosecuted for activities outside the united states 
in tampa panamanian jeweler enrique a kiki pretelt admitted 
in a plea agreement that he helped launder drug proceeds with two 
convicted tampa drug smugglers according to a 10page plea 
agreement 
a fourth silent partner in their business was gen manuel 
noriega the agreement said 
noriega in prison outside of miami is accused in a february 
1988 indictment of taking 46 million in bribes from colombias 
medellin drug cartel to turn panama into a way station for 
usbound drugs 
hoeveler ruled that the argument noriega had sovereign 
immunity as head of state failed because the united states never 
recognized him in that role 
given the serious nature of the drug epidemic in this country 
certainly the efforts of the us to combat the problem by 
prosecuting conduct directed against itself cannot be subject to the 
protest of a foreign nation profiting at us expense the judge 
said 
noriegas lawyers also argued that the indictment should be 
dismissed because the us invasion of panama leading to noriegas 
arrest was so bloody it should shock the conscience 
hoeveler rejected that argument too noriegas complaint is a 
challenge to the very morality of war itself he said this is a 
political question 
defense attorney jon may said the rulings cannot be appealed 
until after the trial 
under the agreement accepted by us district judge william 
castagna in tampa pretelt promised to cooperate fully testify and 
turn over any relevant documents to prosecutors he also will 
forfeit 108000 
pretelt 47 acknowledged conspiring with noriega to take bribes 
from the drug smugglers to help ferry 300 million worth of 
colombian marijuana through panama and hide the profits 
the agreement said noriega and the other partners received a 
commission every time steven michael kalish deposited drug proceeds 
in panamanian bank accounts they were to receive 4 million but 
kalish was arrested before 200 tons of marijuana concealed in a 
shipment of plantain bananas was completed 
the bananas were to be relabled in panama to conceal their 
colombian origin 
kalish has pleaded guilty to other drug charges and testified 
before a us senate subcommittee that the bribes were part of more 
than 4 million in cash jewelry and airplanes his ring gave to 
noriega and his associates 
in return noriega gave kalish a diplomatic passport false 
panamanian customs documents to disguise drug shipments from 
colombia and provided armored car service to shuttle cash according 
to the indictment 
defense attorney george tragos said pretelt the lone 
codefendant in the parallel drug indictment obtained a great 
deal because prosecutors in noriegas drug racketeering case in 
miami want his cooperation 
i think the biggest single incentive the government had for the 
plea agreement is the testimony about general manuel noriega 
tragos said 
pretelt pleaded guilty to two of his three drug counts and will 
be sentenced to no more than 10 years in federal prison prosecutors 
will also recommend that immigration authorities not deport him to 
panama if his testimony puts him in jeopardy sentencing is set for 
aug 16 
pretelt went underground soon after the us invasion of panama 
on dec 20 and surrendered jan 17 noriega also fled taking refuge 
for 10 days at a vatican diplomatic compound before surrendering to 
fbi agents in panama

the inventor of a pushbutton device that 
lets people kill themselves painlessly says terminally ill people 
seeking his help will be distraught to learn hes under court orders 
not to use it 
ill tell them im sorry i cant help you its illegal 
said dr jack kevorkian shaking his head after he was slapped with 
an injunction friday that also barred him from helping people use 
any other means to commit suicide 
its the end of dr k helping patients die said kevorkian 
a 62yearold retired pathologist who this week aided the suicide of 
a woman diagnosed a year ago with alzheimers disease 
judge alice gilbert of oakland county circuit court ordered 
kevorkian to stop using his machine until prosecutors decide whether 
to try him in the suicide monday of janet adkins 54 of portland 
ore 
kevorkian hooked adkins up to his suicide machine in his van 
parked in a state park and she pressed a button that triggered a 
flow of coma and deathinducing drugs into her veins 
michigan law makes neither suicide nor doctorassisted suicide a 
crime and assistant prosecutor michael modelski said there were no 
immediate plans to prosecute 
but the county prosecutor state police and michigan medical 
association are investigating the death of adkins 
everything about this case points to irresponsibility said 
modelski calling kevorkian an angel of death 
he sort of revels in the fact that hes sort of an outcast 
modelski said 
kevorkian said i dont enjoy seeing people die but the 
elderly are killing themselves by all kinds of violent means they 
deserve options 
he said two women in their 80s who heard about the adkins case 
contacted him to offer their support for his device 
they were weeping on the phone the doctor said they know 
that this option is available if they need it 
kevorkian said he probably wont appeal gilberts decision which 
modelski said is effective statewide 
since hes only licensed in michigan that should shut him 
down modelski said 
the doctor who acted as his own lawyer at the hearing had asked 
the judge for a partial injunction which would allow use of his 
machine in a specific set of circumstances 
he said he wanted time to set up a committee of specialists to 
establish a permanent planned death policy and establish an 
obitorium a clinic for the terminally ill who want medical help 
with suicide 
let me put together a small team called the untouchables 
kevorkian said i guarantee under my supervision it would be 
incorruptible 
kevorkians sister flora holzheimer of frankfurt west germany 
testified that she spent last saturday with her brother mrs adkins 
and mrs adkins husband ronald 
holzheimer said that when she picked up mrs adkins monday for 
the suicide crusade it was a sad affair she had her bag in her 
hand her husband straightened his tie they said their 
goodbyes

doctors are examining former hardline 
communist leader erich honecker and other top members of his ousted 
regime to determine whether they are well enough to be jailed an 
east german official said 
despite health minister juergen kleditzschs announcement it 
remains questionable whether the leaders of the former regime will 
go on trial 
kleditzschs statement friday marked the latest in a series of 
changing signals regarding the hated 77yearold honecker who ruled 
east germany in an authoritarian manner for 18 years until his 
downfall last october 
officials said late last year they would try honecker for high 
treason but later said they were dropping prosecution plans 
altogether because of the deposed leaders failing health 
there has been similar uncertainty regarding the trials of some 
of honeckers aging and ailing former top lieutenants most of the 
allegations against them center on corruption and abuse of office 
in a parliamentary debate broadcast live on east german 
television kleditzsch indicated that some criminal proceedings are 
again being considered 
at the request of the chief prosecutor there is a team of 
expert doctors dealing with whether honecker and other members of 
the communist party and national leadership can be jailed and 
interrogated said kleditzsch 
the health minister added that honecker and the others whom he 
did not name have been in a government hospital in east berlin 
since may 28 
kleditzsch offered no further details earlier in the debate one 
member of parliament bernhardt opitz said he wanted to know 
whether honecker can be tried for crimes against humanity 
the other top target of the criminal allegations is erich mielke 
the 82yearold former head of the oncedreaded secret police 
at the moment the county is grappling with other major problems 
that might make many east germans eager to avoid what would likely 
become a major show trial 
those problems include massive unemployment and possible unrest 
likely to grip the country late this summer and in the autumn once 
the west german currency replaces the east german mark as part of 
the economic merger of the two germanys 
east german leaders also are working to resolve the stalemate 
over the question of the military status of a united germany the 
soviet union has opposed proposals that a unified germany belong to 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
last month interior minister petermichael diestel said 
honeckers failing health made a trial unlikely 
diestel who is also the countrys deputy prime minister said he 
would not consider such a prosecution simply as a means of 
appeasing the peoples anger 
honecker was arrested on jan 29 freed the following day and 
sent to live with a lutheran pastor and his wife in the town of 
lobetal 
the former leader who suffers from kidney cancer was later 
taken to the soviet military hospital in the town of beelitz before 
his transfer to the government hospital in east berlin

voter readiness to accept multiparty 
democracy is being put to a decisive test in algeria and tunisia in 
local elections sunday and tuesday 
in each of the north african neighbors the governing party has 
held sole power since french colonial rule ended decades ago and 
that party is virtually certain to win control of a large majority 
of councils 
the main question is the level of support amassed by radical 
islamic groups among voters unaccustomed to being given a choice 
fundamentalist groups have aligned under the banner of the 
islamic salvation front in algeria where tuesdays election will be 
the first under a multiparty system the fronts candidates are 
running in almost all the 1541 municipalities and provincial 
councils 
but in tunisia the government has withheld official recognition 
of islamic groups on the grounds that god belongs to all tunisians 
the fundamentalists have declared an official boycott of sundays 
elections so antigovernment sentiment will be gauged by the number 
of abstentions 
the elections will be the second time tunisian voters have had a 
free choice 
in legislative elections in 1988 the governing constitutional 
democratic rally won every seat in the national assembly opposition 
parties later accused the party in power of having abused its 
control of state funds transport and mass media 
by contrast a genuine election contest is expected in algeria 
almost all parties will compete and have proclaimed in advance that 
they will accept the results 
however the algerian situation is not simple many democratic 
parties seeking an alternative to both the government and the 
fundamentalists have entered candidates but they are divided in 
some cases more hostile to each other than to the governing national 
liberation front one coalition the front of socialist forces has 
called for an election boycott despite its potential for a strong 
showing 
another factor is the position taken by the followers of ahmed 
ben bella the former president ousted by a military coup in 1965 
and now an exile in switzerland both the national liberation front 
and the fundamentalists have urged backers of ben bellas movement 
for democracy in algeria to join their side but ben bella has given 
no endorsement 
the future stance of the powerful algerian army also remains in 
doubt the fundamentalists are openly calling for military 
intervention to establish an islamic republic but senior army 
officers seem more likely to support a state free of religious 
interference 
in both tunisia and algeria the vote is for a list of locally 
selected party candidates in each an official result may not be 
announced for days 
in one respect the two voting systems differ markedly 
tunisia has a westernstyle oneperson onevote system resulting 
from a modern family code established by former president habib 
bourguiba in algeria the family code is based on islamic 
principles and a man can vote on behalf of his wife or wives 
without having to produce any document authorizing him to do so

stuffed with dollar bills about 90 minutes before a deadline to wire 
the money to a bank in quito ecuador 
they also sent a videotaped plea for mercy for their son scott 
heimdal 27 who was ambushed april 28 in northern ecuador 
i pleaded for my sons life mrs heimdal said i begged i 
said please give me my son back hes my only son 
ive never begged before i dont know if i did it right 
an intermediary was to take the money into the jungle along the 
ecuadorcolombia border this weekend in search of the kidnappers 
whom us officials have identified as maoist guerrillas 
the kidnappers originally sought 12 million but lowered their 
demand to 60000 
but the heimdals lost their life savings paying medical bills 
after mrs heimdal 47 was severely injured in an accident with an 
uninsured drunken driver several years ago on tuesday they went on 
television to appeal for help raising the ransom 
nursing homes held bake sales waitresses donated their tips and 
children handed over their piggy banks and in four days the 
heimdals had 60000 
a shiver went down my spine when they told me we had 60000 
roy heimdal said im stunned 
the heimdals declined to disclose exactly how much money was 
raised fearing the kidnappers might demand more they have promised 
a full accounting after their sons release 
even as the heimdals fought their way through a herd of reporters 
into the bank strangers approached with dollar bills for their 
overflowing coffee cans and words of encouragement 
i just want you to know were all pulling for you an 
unidentified young girl told mrs heimdal before walking off 
the family hopes the ordeal will be capped next week by a 
communitywide welcome home celebration for their son who has worked 
the past two years for international mining co which mines gold 
near quito 
he was traveling by boat with four others when the group was 
ambushed the pilot was killed and another was injured 
the kidnappers reportedly members of a colombian group known as 
the popular liberation army have threatened to show us where his 
body is mrs heimdal said 
in quito jeffrey fino manager of iminco in ecuador reported no 
progress friday in negotiations to free scott heimdal 
a government source who demanded anonymity told the associated 
press that lowprofile negotiations are most likely to succeed the 
source said a spanish bull salesman kidnapped last month in quito 
was released unharmed upon payment of 1 million and lack of 
publicity helped the negotiations

sheriffs deputies made their first 
arrest of a record retailer under a federal judges ruling deeming a 
rap record by 2 live crew obscene the bands leader said his record 
label will help pay legal fees 
the group performed its sexually explicit material live in miami 
beach early today authorities did not interfere with the 45minute 
show 
the audience cheered when band leader luther campbell shouted 
vulgarities about gov bob martinez and broward county sheriff nick 
navarro whose deputies friday arrested ec records owner charles 
freeman 31 on misdemeanor charges of distributing obscene material 
the deputies burst into the store after an undercover agent 
bought the groups recording as nasty as they wanna be which 
us district judge jose gonzalez ruled wednesday is obscene the 
ruling did not affect live performances 
if convicted freeman could be sentenced to a year in jail and 
fined 1000 he was released from county jail on 100 bond 
the inevitable has finally occurred said robyn e blumner 
executive director of the american civil liberties union in florida 
someone in broward is facing jail time because he sold a record 
album to an adult 
that action put south florida about on a par with eastern 
europe a year ago 
blumner said the aclu will offer to represent freeman someone 
has got to stand up and say this is wrong she said 
freemans case probably will go before a jury that will have to 
decide whether the album is criminally obscene 
gonzalez found in a civil case that the sexually explicit 
recording was without social value appealed only to prurient 
interests and violated community standards in dade broward and palm 
beach counties 
lyrics of many of the songs on the album contain misogynist and 
violent references though theyre tempered with humor 
navarro said his deputies went to freemans store after freeman 
was quoted in news reports as saying he would sell the album despite 
the ban 
we could not in good conscience allow him to flagrantly ignore 
the courts order navarro said at a news conference friday 
campbell owner and president of the groups record label 
lukes said the company will help pay the legal fees of people 
arrested for selling the album 
somebody has to stand up and the retailers i think should 
stand up campbell said we can give them some of the contacts 
we used in our case and we can help them financially campbell did 
not give specifics 
the miamibased rap group sued after navarro acting on the 
ruling of a county judge who said the material was probably 
obscene sent his deputies in march to warn retailers they faced 
arrest 
gonzalez said the sheriffs office engaged in prior restraint of 
free speech by threatening owners before the recording was ruled 
obscene 
the judges obscenity ruling has no legal effect outside south 
florida but civil libertarians see a practical effect spreading 
nationally 
lisa penna who attended the show at the miami beach nightclub 
said the controversy surrounding the group is a political vehicle 
for people trying to get reelected 
of the groups raps she said all of this has to be taken in 
jest

rita swan knows the pain of losing a child 
for deliberate denial of medical attention now she is determined 
that other parents be prosecuted for making the same decision 
work from her home in this tiny northwest iowa town ms swan 
takes credit for prompting more than two dozen prosecutions against 
parents whose children died as they followed religious teachings for 
treating illness with prayer 
most of the parents are members of christian science church so 
at one time was ms swan 
the right of a child to live should be the highest priority of 
a civilized society she said 
the christian scientists say the death of a child is one of the 
great mysteries of the ages but i say the death is not mysterious 
at all it is the logical and inevitable result of withholding 
medical attention 
rita and doug swan a math teacher at a nearby college formed 
the group childrens health care is a legal duty or child in 1983 
six years after their son matthew died of meningitis at 15 months 
ms swan 46 said there are 300 child members in 42 states and 
canada who monitor cases 
in the 80s 29 sets of prosecutions were filed for 
religiousbased medical neglect she said thats an amazing 
turnaround in general in the 70s these children just died and 
nobody cared 
the results are mixed with verdicts ranging from acquittal to 
conviction on a charge of murder 
the general counsel for the national counsel against health fraud 
said ms swan singlehandedly has raised the question of medical 
neglect with prosecutors across the country 
she puts a bug in their ears said michael botts of kansas 
city mo shes the one who deserves the credit its her guts 
that did it without her nothing would have been done 
he said several courts have ruled that parents can be held 
accountable for the death of a child notwithstanding religious 
beliefs 
youve got parents playing abraham out there they believe if 
their religion is strong enough the child will be saved its 
nothing short of human sacrifice to prove the strength of religious 
convictions he said 
other courts have dismissed such actions however based on 
religious exemptions in state child abuse laws 
christian scientists say healingbyprayer is usually successful 
and protected by guarantees of religious freedom 
we all grieved over her son but she has now used it to wage a 
vendetta against the church said wendell deware a christian 
scientist practitioner from davenport 
a small number of children in the care of christian science 
practitioners do die deware said but we encounter such 
situations so rarely 
the media has concentrated so much on these failures they will 
not take into account the vast majority of successes 
the church founded in 1879 by mary baker eddy believes that 
physical disease like sin can be healed by spiritual means alone 
there are about 2600 christian science churches in 68 countries 
most states including iowa prohibit the filing of childabuse 
charges against parents who use prayer in treatment of their 
children but prosecutors have filed other charges in several 
jurisdictions 
the swans then living in a suburb of detroit sued the church 
after matthew died in 1977 the us supreme court without comment 
let stand a lower court ruling that barred the lawsuit on religious 
freedom grounds 
he died of meningitis the common and most treatable form 
ms swan said he had three terrible fevers about a month apart 
preceding this illness each time we called a christian scientist 
practitioner and he got well based on ignorance we thought the 
practitioner had accomplished something significant 
a fourth fever claimed the boys life 
ms swan said she is driven by my sense of duty to our son to 
seek prosecutions in other cases 
im proudest of the prosecutions i think thats my strongest 
weapon against the church its not vindictiveness its something 
that has got to change i feel our work has almost singlehandedly 
turned the country around on this issue to the point where the death 
of a christian science child will almost certainly get some 
scrutiny

from osh clashes between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks both sunni 
moslems began june 2 and the fighting intensified monday soviet

emergency in border districts in the republic because of what tass 
called a sharp aggravation of the situation 
a state of emergency also was in effect in the kirghiz border 
city of osh where troops patrolled the streets and in frunze 
uzbek president islam karimov who declared the state of 
emergency on his side of the border sent an urgent telegram to

arsenic was found in freed hostage frank reeds 
body shortly after his release from 44 months in captivity hospital 
officials said 
the officials would not comment on how much of the poison was 
found in reeds system nor on the source of the toxin 
reed 57 of malden mass has been undergoing treatment at the 
malcolm grow medical center at andrews air force base in maryland 
since soon after his april 30 release from lebanon 
in a statement friday the hospital said screening for heavy 
metal substances such as arsenic lead and mercury was normal 
procedure for returning hostages and prisoners 
these tests were performed on mr reeds arrival the initial 
test for arsenic was positive subsequent tests confirmed this 
exposure to arsenic and its elimination to a nontoxic level the 
hospital said 
a base spokesman sgt dale warman said late friday no further 
details were available 
bob woolf reeds attorney said in a telephone interview from 
miami that the former hostages arsenic levels were abnormally high 
this was beyond what was normal believe me woolf said it 
was enough to be concerned about 
reeds wife fahima said she believed her husband had been 
poisoned by his captors 
what else could it be the arsenic couldnt get in his body 
just like that she said 
im outraged that they would have done something like this 
she said im just happy that hes ok that nothings been 
damaged 
woolf would not comment on the possible source of the arsenic he 
said some of the toxin had been eliminated from reeds body since he 
began medical treatment but that traces remained 
its not completely out of his system but now its at a 
controlled nontoxic level woolf said 
reed had been surprised by the finding woolf said 
it was a little shocking and frightening for him woolf said 
this was serious and totally unexpected 
it is still unclear what effects the poison would have on reeds 
health woolf said the malden native was gaunt and weak after his 
release and during a memorial day visit to his hometown he said he 
suffered from severe anemia 
we still dont know what all the ramifications are woolf 
said but he seems to be coming along fine hes gaining weight 
and im hopeful hell be released in a few weeks 
arsenic is used to make insecticides glass medicines and 
semiconductors exposure to high levels of the substance can produce 
a burning pain in ones esophagus and stomach vomiting diarrhea 
and depression prolonged exposure can lead to a rapid feeble pulse 
and circulatory collapse 
dr alan woolf director of the massachusetts poison center said 
trace amounts of arsenic could get into a persons system from water 
and food especially seafood 
you or i might have traces of arsenic in our blood after a 
heavy seafood dinner the doctor said 
reed was director of the private lebanese international school in 
beirut when he was seized by islamic extremists in 1986 after his 
release he told of being beaten when he tried to escape and of being 
chained and blindfolded for months at a time 
peggy say sister of hostage terry anderson said she was 
appalled by the news of the arsenic and worried it could mean other 
hostages could also be affected 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was taken hostage march 16 1985 reed has said he last saw 
anderson between a year and 18 months ago

sexclusiv east germanys first sex 
magazine hits newsstands today ushering in a new sexual revolution 
after 40 years of restrictions under communist rule 
the magazine devoted to promoting sexual awareness is backed by 
east germanys german sex league the state news agency adn said 
unlike in west germany where sex magazines and pornographic 
material are readily available east germanys former hardline 
communist government banned such material 
but with the loosening of restrictions following last falls 
democratic upheaval the sex league has set for itself the goal of 
promoting new sexual freedom in east germany 
on friday members of the sex league gathered in leipzig the 
heart of the peaceful revolution that toppled the communist 
government last year 
the first order of business was changing the groups name from 
its original german sex union adn said 
the groups original name was picked last fall when the 
communists were ousted but it had the same initials in german as 
the conservative german social union a member of east germanys 
governing coalition 
adn said erotic videos were also shown at the meeting the news 
agency did not say how many people attended or how many members the 
group claims to have 
the first edition of sexclusiv is priced at six marks 
360 the price appeared to be a play on words since the number 
six is pronounced sex in german

tar balls as large as footballs have washed 
ashore on two beaches after a grounded tanker spilled 260000 
gallons of heavy crude oil into a commercial waterway in new york 
harbor a coast guard official said 
but neither coney island nor rockaway beach on the atlantic 
ocean within about five miles of the harbor mouth was expected to 
be closed today said petty officer gary rives 
its not a thick coating its just some tar balls washing 
ashore he said 
a coast guard board of inquiry is to begin hearings monday on the 
grounding of a britishowned tanker carrying home heating oil 
thursday in the kill van kull a shipping channel between bayonne 
and the staten island borough of new york city 
the panel also will consider other spills this year that have 
dumped more than 1 million gallons of oil into the harbor four 
times the amount spilled last year the coast guard said 
the panel has been called because we do not know if it is bad 
luck or a common thread that binds these incidents said rear adm 
gene henn who will chair the hearings 
meanwhile about 420 workers and guardsmen on a flotilla of 
nearly 80 vessels cleaned the shores and waters of kill van kull 
the cleanup is expected to last at least two months 
miles of absorbent boom contained nearly all the oil in the 
narrow channel and spared the shooters island bird sanctuary coast 
guard officials said 
the kill van kull which normally handles 200 vessels daily was 
reopened friday afternoon on a casebycase basis after remaining 
closed for about 36 hours the coast guard said 
about 9000 gallons of the industrial fuel has been recovered so 
far said capt robert north adding that usually only 15 percent to 
20 percent of a spill is recaptured the remainder will either 
dissipate or sink officials said 
the tankers first mate geoffrey frederick gregory 52 new 
marske england faces state charges of operating a vessel while 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs he is also charged with 
negligent discharge of a pollutant without a permit 
he pleaded innocent to the charges at a hearing in bayonne 
municipal court on thursday and was ordered to reappear june 12 he 
was released after putting up 10 percent of a 50000 bond 
capt james sanial in charge of a separate coast guard 
investigation said gregory was at his post at the front of the 
tanker as the vessel made its way to the dock in bayonne 
florentz described gregory as a spotter and said his duties 
during the docking operation were to stand on the bow and look for 
obstructions 
however gregorys attorney richard regan of hoboken said that 
was not his clients responsibility he did not elaborate

british prime minister margaret thatcher 
today assured jewish refuseniks that her support for their right to 
emigrate has not been diminished by her anger with israel over west 
bank settlements 
on the third day of a fourday visit mrs thatcher had breakfast 
with six refuseniks or citizens who have been refused permission to 
emigrate before arriving in kiev the capital of the ukraine to 
tour a british cultural and trade exhibition 
several thousand people pressed against barriers cheering as the 
british leader arrived at the 17 million exhibition a british 
military band played scotland the brave 
mrs thatcher met the refuseniks after sharply criticizing israel 
during a joint news conference friday with president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
she said israels policy of letting soviet jews settle on the 
west bank was wrong and added i think it is almost letting down 
those of us who have campaigned vigorously for jewish emigration 
but british officials said that at the breakfast with the 
refuseniks she assured them that britains policy was unchanged 
she told them that britain will continue to support them and 
raise their cause said a british official he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
during the news conference friday gorbachev repeated warnings 
that he may curb the emigration of soviet jews unless israel stops 
the new arrivals from settling on the west bank 
under gorbachevs liberalized policies soviet jewish emigration 
is running at a record level israel says some 35000 soviet jews 
have arrived this year but it says it has no policy of settling 
them in the occupied territories and that only a few hundred have 
settled there 
the refuseniks who met with mrs thatcher included jewish 
mathematician mark kotlyar an activist in the increasingly restless 
nationalist movement the ukrainian popular front 
he has been refused permission to leave on grounds that he had 
access to classified information when he worked in the soviet 
ministry of radio industry until 1975 
on friday mrs thatcher and gorbachev set out opposing positions 
on the feasibility of an alleuropean security system to bridge the 
opposing military alliances 
however both expressed optimism that there will be a solution to 
the dispute over western insistence that a united germany remain in 
nato 
i am quite sure we can come up with an option gorbachev said 
at a joint news conference after more than four hours of talks 
the soviet president who is beset by mounting domestic troubles 
declined an invitation to travel with mrs thatcher to kiev 
after the fall of communist governments in moscows six european 
allies gorbachev is confronted by the crumbling of the sevennation 
sovietled warsaw pact as a military alliance 
the warsaw pact said after a summit thursday that it plans to 
become a purely political and consultative body by november 
gorbachev told fridays news conference he envisions the 
formation of a new alleuropean security system 
we believe there is a chance for the formation of a new type of 
relationship between the two alliances as they go through a 
transforming process while overcoming military confrontation or at 
least easing military confrontation in europe he said 
although mrs thatcher acknowledged a new spirit between nato 
and the warsaw pact she said it was vital to maintain the western 
alliance complete with nuclear weapons and the us troop presence 
in western europe 
for the time being we should continue to work through the 
existing organization she said 
mrs thatcher envisages the strengthening of the 35nation 
conference on european security and cooperation which includes 
almost all of the european nations 
she emphasized that nato is sensitive to soviet concerns about 
german unification and is seeking to find means of reassurance 
including for example keeping soviet troops in what is now east 
germany for a transitional period

a few spot fires were smoldering today at 
a chemical packaging plant that was ripped by a series of 
chainreaction explosions that hurled flames and barrels 300 feet 
into the sky 
two employees were injured in the fire that erupted late friday 
morning at the solvents amp chemicals inc plant and burned all day 
the explosions apparently were sparked by a punctured barrel that 
ignited 
the area surrounding the plant in an industrial area south of 
houston was ordered evacuated but few people left and the order was 
later lifted authorities did not believe toxic fumes were a problem 
thick black smoke billowed for several hours and had almost 
dissipated by friday evening authorities said 
the plant continued to smolder with heavy smoke early today and 
firefighters from several cities were fighting a few spot fires 
with foam said a pearland fire department dispatcher who refused to 
be identified 
its under control now and were just watching it and waiting 
for it to go out on its own said susan jarmon another dispatcher 
company spokesman george foster said about 40 employees were 
safely evacuated from the plant which has about 50 storage tanks 
outside 
apparently theres a significant loss to the building 
structure foster said but the tanks seem to be intact 
the 20yearold company packages various chemicals for sale to 
hardware and grocery stores including paint and lacquer thinners 
windshield washer products and charcoal starters said jordi baizan 
another company spokesman 
police sgt armando garza said he arrived when several 55gallon 
barrels began exploding he said he heard about 30 explosions before 
he fled 
it was very loud and kind of scary garza said you see a 
55gallon barrel drum go some 300 feet into the air and you dont 
know where its going to land 
eloy salazar 26 was the most seriously injured with secondand 
thirddegree burns on his chest face and back 
they were apparently depressurizing some 55gallon drums and 
there was a spark i believe from a fork lift and that set off the 
fire said dr jeff britton who treated salazar 
another employee 49yearold alexander jacky was treated for 
minor burns to his forearm six firefighters and emergency workers 
were also treated for heat exhaustion or smoke inhalation

mayor david dinkins warned jewish groups against 
protesting the visit of antiapartheid leader nelson mandela to new 
york city saying the protests might insult the black community a 
newspaper said today 
the mayor also asked members of the organized jewish 
community to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the 
visit the daily news said 
mandela leader of the african national congress will visit 
eight cities from june 20 to july 1 
there is a danger of many people who hold nelson mandela in 
very very high esteem taking great umbrage at any public protest 
dinkins said 
i think its sad and unfortunate and tactically very very 
unwise because this man is an international symbol of freedom and 
especially so seen by persons of color dinkins told the newspaper 
in an interview 
leaders of several jewishamerican organizations plan to meet 
mandela on sunday in geneva the organizations want the south 
african leader to clarify his position on israel 
mandela has embraced yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization in public and has compared the struggle of 
palestinians to that of black south africans 
rabbi abraham weiss of the hebrew institute announced his 
coalition of concern will hold a protest at mandelas public welcome 
in new york because of the antiapartheid leaders unbending 
antiisrael stance 
city councilman noach dear and state assemblyman dov hikind said 
if mandela does not make a strong statement in support of israel 
they would take out ads in newspapers and hold demonstrations

rival christian forces skirmished with 
mortars in east beirut today raising fears that a fragile 
23dayold vaticanbrokered ceasefire could soon collapse 
police said no casualties were reported in the early morning 
mortar exchanges between troops loyal to rebel gen michel aoun and 
the lebanese forces militia led by samir geagea 
the ceasefire went into effect may 17 and has halted major 
clashes between the rival christian forces which have been battling 
for control of the 310squaremile christian enclave since jan 30 
but despite the ceasefire there have been daily firefights 
between aouns troops and geageas militiamen police officials said 
allout fighting could resume because mediators have failed to 
secure a political settlement 
nothing has changed at the political level said a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified by name under standing 
regulations both sides remain in their positions and no one can 
predict how much longer this ceasefire will hold 
by police count 1036 people have been killed and 2772 wounded 
in the aoungeagea power struggle 
the fighting has driven an estimated 400000 of the enclaves 1 
million population to seek refuge in other parts of lebanon or 
abroad 
the police spokesman said some of the refugees who sought 
sanctuary in moslem west beirut cross into the eastern christian 
sector of the capital daily to check on their property but he said 
they leave before nightfall because they fear a fresh outbreak of 
violence 
aoun has rejected octobers arab leaguebrokered peace accord 
aimed at ending lebanons 15yearold civil war because it does not 
include a specific timetable for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian 
troops from lebanon he also has refused to recognize the 
syrianbacked president elias hrawi 
geagea has recognized hrawis authority and given his cautious 
support to the arab league peace plan 
in another development senior officials of rival shiite moslem 
factions met in an effort to resolve their intermittent 3yearold 
war for mastery of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys 
largest sect 
the meetings between representatives of the syrianbacked amal 
militia and the proiranian hezbollah or party of god are 
sponsored by brig gen ghazi kenaan head of syrian military 
intelligence in lebanon and irans ambassador to syria mohammad 
hassan akhtari 
the meetings which began friday were attended by sheik abbas 
musawi of the fundamentalist hezbollah and mohammed baydoun of the 
mainstream amal 
both shiite factions said in separate statements that they 
welcomed the new effort by syria and iran to end the fighting 
more than 1000 people have been killed and more than 3000 
wounded in the shiite fighting in beirut and south lebanon 
beiruts independent annahar daily said today that an expanded 
meeting between amal and hezbollah leaders will be held in damascus 
the syrian capital once kenaan and akhtari obtain the agreement of 
the rival factions the newspaper gave no date for such a meeting

czechs and slovaks prepared today 
to welcome their first freely elected government in more than 40 
years but a controversy between the two most powerful parties 
overshadowed the euphoria of free voting 
polls opened at dawn today for the second day of balloting and 
were to close at 2 pm 8 am edt final results were expected on 
sunday 
civic forum the loose grouping of intellectuals students and 
dissidents who fueled the revolution seven months ago that ended the 
communist grip on power was heavily favored along with its slovak 
partner public against violence 
the christian democratic alliance was expected to be the 
runnerup with only three other parties the communists the 
enviromentalist greens and the social democrats projected to do 
well enough to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to be represented 
in parliament 
all the 21 parties contesting the election alongside the 
communists campaigned on a heavily anticommunist platform 
voters were electing a new twochamber federal parliament and 
deputies for regional parliaments in the czech and slovak republics 
it is the fourth instance of free balloting in formerly communist 
east europe east germany hungary and romania held elections 
earlier this year 
the new 300seat parliament will choose a president and is 
expected to pick president vaclav havel the playwright and former 
dissident who led the anticommunist revolution parliaments main 
job during its twoyear term is to rewrite the constitution 
the elections remained the main event but have had to share 
space in the media with a dispute between the civic forum and the 
christian democrats 
at issue are the alleged links of a top christian democrat josef 
bartoncik with the despised secret police of the past communist 
regime 
bartonciks peoples party one of three parties in the christian 
democratic alliance filed suit thursday against a deputy interior 
minister and civic forum sympathizer jan ruml who accused 
bartoncik of wrongdoing the peoples party said rumls actions 
contravened the election law forbidding any electioneering 48 hours 
before the voting 
havel backed ruml thursday night and said on friday that his 
fellow former dissident was one of the most honest men he knew 
today havels office accused bartoncik of long years of 
collaboration with the feared secret police of the toppled communist 
regime for 17 years he was a paid adviser of the stb havel 
adviser jiri krizan using the czechoslovak acronynm for the former 
secret police 
havel 53 while remaining immensely popular has raised the ire 
of some of the electorate who accuse him of overtly supporting civic 
forum a stance they consider as violating presidential 
impartiality 
during voting authorities have banned the sale of alcohol except 
beer and posted police at public places from polling stations to 
post offices 
for young people who have never voted and older citizens who 
thought democracy had vanished in the 1930s with the nazis and again 
in 1948 with the communist takeover the balloting has been a dream 
come true 
i didnt hope to see free elections again milena jirotova 
68 said friday 
its a new feeling said katrina hauffova 20 i couldnt 
imagine anything like this

almost overlooked in the soviet unions 
nationwide tumult central asians are reclaiming their identity 
waging a freeform rebellion against moscow while warring among 
themselves 
new political movements led by intellectuals and fed by an 
islamic revival accuse local authorities of perpetuating kremlim 
control poverty and social frustration are sowing violence 
vicious communal riots quelled by shoottokill military 
repression have killed hundreds of people perhaps more than 1000 
in the past year rampaging youths have torched whole neighborhoods 
throughout the region activists say that president mikhail s 
gorbachevs promise of perestroika eludes asians who do not want 
space in the common european home he envisions for the future 
unlike the northern regions where baltic republics bargain for a 
separate place in a new europe central asians pursue a dream of 
reviving 1000yearold roots stifled by russian rule 
despite 70 years of soviet overlay much of the region remains 
almost as the silkcaravan drivers found it on their way from china 
only blocks from tashkents grandiose monuments to soviet saviors 
old men in robes and skullcaps sip tea under mulberry trees 
beyond mud walls on winding streets hardly wide enough for a 
laden donkey youths read the koran and mutter darkly about a 
century of russian imperialism increasingly they are ready to 
fight for independence from moscow 1800 miles away 
this is like what happened in algeria said igor krupnik a 
specialist in ethnic conflict at the soviet academy of sciences 
recalling the upheaval that drove france from its north african 
colony 
but unlike in algeria he said bitter divisions among peoples in 
the five central asia republics add the threat of internal civil 
war pitting asians against each other as they resist moscow 
in uzbekistan the thirdmost populous soviet republic and in 
tadzhikistan to the south along the afghan border russians are 
leaving in growing numbers joining an exodus of ethnic minorities 
although some russians admit to fear of violence many say they 
are leaving before worsening economic and social conditions in 
central asia trigger a mass departure 
there is potential for unrest across a vast area approaching a 
population of 50 million 
while fighting in the caucasus is confined to welldelineated 
borders as in lebanon krupnik said internal strife among central 
asian groups could spill across a soviet southern border stretching 
from iran to china 
on june 4 violence broke out between uzbeks and kirghiz on the 
border between their republics over desperately scarce land a 
skirmish grew to a pitched battle and scores were killed 
like tinder igniting from a small spark fighting spread to 
frunze capital of kirghizia uzbeks and kirghiz like kazahks and 
turkmen share turkic roots but also a history of conflict 
tadzhiks ethnic persians clash sporadically with neighboring 
uzbeks 
the soviet policy of clamping down hard acts to intensify 
frustration asians say 
in kazakhstan the sweep of steppe bridging russia and asia 
tension is less evident but young radicals deride authorities in 
moscow for crushing nationalist stirrings 
a kazakh editor of the underground weekly turkestan afraid to 
be named for fear of reprisal said she turned radical when troops 
fired on crowds in alma ata kazakhstan in 1986 
kazakhs were protesting the nomination of a russian as first 
secretary of the local communist party it was the first ethnic 
violence after gorbachev took power 
for the outside gorbachev is a champion of perestroika she 
said for us he is a hangman 
leaders of popular front movements in three troubled republics 
said in interviews that their goal was independence within a few 
years although none wanted to pin down details 
we want independence as soon as possible but it is too early 
to say what that means said abdurahim pulatov chairman of the 
unofficial uzbekistan party birlik a vanguard movement 
mohammed solikh an uzbek poet who heads the rival opposition 
movement erk echoed pulatovs remarks 
western specialists say central asians although divided among 
themselves share a common purpose to restore their language 
culture and traditional values 
i am amazed by an overwhelming sentiment to throw the rascals 
out said edward allworth a columbia university professor who has 
written widely on central asia and was in tashkent for new research 
travel restrictions limit access but interviews in areas 
recently closed to foreigners and under curfew reflect emotions 
ranging from vague unease to panic in the rich fergana valley east 
of here the mood is grim 
they killed like animals said a law student named nasli an 
ethnic turk whose family was among many thousands displaced by 
stalin from meskhetia in southern georgia generations ago 
she recalled the fergana valley violence a year ago that took 107 
lives by official count 
there were at least a thousand dead she said uzbeks 
chopped off childrens hands gouged out eyes burned people alive 
her familys tashkent house was burned in new violence last 
february a ripple from bloody assaults in the town of parkent 60 
miles from here now i am leaving for good nasli said 
only last month gangs of young uzbeks rampaged through the 
fergana town of andizhan firebombing the homes of armenians jews 
and ethnic russians women were raped but no one was killed 
victims said local authorities ignored appeals for help 
krupnik called that a new tactic to frighten minorities without 
attracting army reprisals these things are very serious 
authorities respond in the old way and the situation worsens 
in february thousands of young tadzhiks sacked dushanbe in riots 
touched off by reports that armenian refugees from azerbaijan were 
being given scarce housing quickly witnesses said they turned on 
russians 
a senior tadzhik official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said two people were killed by rioters the rest were shot by army 
troops restoring order heightening resentment against moscow the 
official put the death toll at twice the official figure of 27 
in the aftermath tadzhik intellectuals rankled at moscow papers 
that emphasized attacks on russians the real target tadzhiks said 
was the stifling soviet system 
we have nothing against russians and we condemn the 
violence said abdujabor tohir head of rastohez or renaissance 
the tadzhik popular front but we want to control our own 
lives 
like pulatov and solikh in tashkent he denied that islam was 
behind the violence it is social frustration he said noting 
that tadzhikistans underemployment approached a third of the work 
force 
opposition leaders say they want to build an economy that allows 
youths to find jobs and homes 
they say that an imposed dependence on cotton has not only hurt 
the environment but also has crippled possibilities for economic 
viability without soviet support 
but fired with a sense of cultural and natural identity 
suppressed since the czars many activists argue that economics will 
follow once the politics are settled 
old corrupt ways still continue solikh said we must wake 
up the people as long as we have governments that look to moscow 
out of touch with the peoples needs we cannot be independent

volodya ishenko a ukrainian architect 
built a good life in central asia he earns four times the average 
soviet wage owns a country home and his wife likes her work but 
they are soon to depart 
im leaving for two reasons and the first is an instinct for 
selfprotection he said 
the second is economic he will take a loss at first ishenko 
figures but will come out ahead by beating the rush to resettle in 
the republic of russia 
the tide of russians and russian speakers is ebbing from the 
troubled reaches of central asia first settled a century ago behind 
the heavy guns of the czars 
since the 1920s the region has been part of a seamless soviet 
state now spurred by perestroika and a resurgence of islamic and 
cultural sentiment central asians are demanding their birthright 
pressure on outsiders ranges from subtle remarks to bloody 
pogroms 
i must admit i hurried up my decision after february ishenko 
said referring to bloody riots the issue that set off the violence 
was armenian refugees but rioters beheaded the statue of a general 
who led russians into tadzhikistan 
demographers have few reliable statistics but see significant 
movement that began slowly about five years ago and recently has 
increased sharply 
many russians are leaving and there would be a lot more if 
they could find a place to go said igor krupnik a specialist on 
ethnic affairs at the soviet academy of sciences 
figures for uzbekistan show a net loss of 48800 russians during 
1988 before pogroms in the fergana valley speeded up the pace a 
recent census said russians made up 11 percent of the republics 19 
million inhabitants 
in tadzhikistan a first wave left after february abandoning 
furniture and even clothing in their haste now departing russians 
are taking the time to examine their options 
i think every russian in town would leave if they had the 
possibility said a ranking professor named olga who decided she 
could not find anywhere to go with her retired parents 
emigrants must not only find jobs but apartments in a country 
where little is for sale and people wait years for housing

with intensive coverage worthy of a summit meeting 
badgers proved themselves quite ready for prime time on british 
television 
for three nights last week badger night on bbc2 showed 
badgers scratching snorting scuffling and stalking the wily 
english earthworm 
were so close to them cooed jessica holm doing the 
playbyplay from a tiny booth near the badger den 
grgarogaraow said a badger standing nearby 
a crew from bbc bristol set up a month ago on land owned by 
badger expert don hunford who had been watching this group of 
badgers since 1957 the bbc would only say the badgers were in essex 
county northeast of london 
the animals are britains largest mammal and have many friends 
among britons who grew up with tales of mr toad and mr badger in 
the wind in the willows 
chris skinner the official county badger recorder said 800 
badgers dens were counted in essex in 1960 now a third are gone 
and only half of the remainder are occupied she said 
the nature conservancy councils latest count found 43000 badger 
dens in britain with 250000 animals in all main anchor sally 
magnusson said 
ms skinner said the badgers are losing the competition with 
people for land and are killed by hunters and by farmers who regard 
them as pests 
on tape badger night accompanied 14yearold beverly burton 
of staffordshire to a badger baiting pit where sportsmen wager on 
how long it will take their dogs to kill a badger 
the men would pull the claws and the teeth out theyd break 
the back leg and sometimes poke the eyes in so the badger had no 
defense at all miss burton said 
on thursday nights segment a villain appeared in the large 
hearty form of gamekeeper ray walker 
badgers kill lambs he said eat right through the rib cage 
you certainly wouldnt want badgers on your land in the numbers 
they are here walker said 
well ms magnusson asked tony crittenden of the royal society 
for the prevention of cruelty to animals what about it 
couldnt you stand accused of sentimentality couldnt we all 
in fact here as we watch and ooh and aah at our little friends 
playing down there that what were talking about is an oversize 
weasel thats a pest 
absolute nonsense crittenden retorted 
however the image of the cuddly badger savaging woolly lambs had 
clearly stung 
badgers very rarely kill lambs said stephen harris a badger 
specialist from bristol university 
can you honestly imagine badgers like these going out and 
killing lambs said ms holm a zoologist who specializes in 
squirrels 
it doesnt make sense to me jessica said hunford who 
added they are not hunters they would make a hopeless mess if 
they tried 
cut to the house of commons where ms holm earlier interviewed 
the badgers friend in parliament tony banks of the opposition 
labor party 
banks is sponsoring a bill to require fox hunters to stop badger 
holes with soft earth before a hunt rather than concrete and rocks 
it seems silly to me to protect the animal and not the animals 
home banks said at the moment people can dig for foxes can 
dig if their dog has gone down or if their granny accidentally 
stumbled down there 
if anyone suspected a certain probadger slant in the series ms 
magnusson came clean on friday night 
it would be disingenuous of us to pretend that these three 
programs of ours havent been partisan she said

prime minister brian mulroney and the nations 10 
provincial premiers tried today to conclude a constitutional 
agreement that would prevent frenchspeaking quebec from pulling out 
of canada 
it was the seventh straight day that the first ministers as 
they are called here met privately in ottawas conference center to 
win the required unanimous agreement on the meech lake accord 
a tired baggyeyed mulroney announced early this morning after a 
marathon session that canada is whole again saying lawyers were 
working to finalize an agreement 
meech lake must be approved by the legislatures of all 10 
provinces by june 23 or the 1987 accord which recognizes 
frenchspeaking quebec as a distinct society is dead the 
accord is named after the meech lake government retreat near ottawa 
where it was originally worked out 
its important to national unity that we get this debate behind 
us new brunswick premier frank mckenna told reporters as he 
returned to the conference hall late this morning 
i believe its critical that we get meech lake off the agenda 
i dont believe that canadians ever ever want to hear about meech 
lake again 
these things are never really final until theyre all signed 
sealed and delivered mulroney said there remains some 
important work to be done 
we have an agreement in principle british columbia premier 
bill vander zalm said but newfoundland premier clyde wells said he 
was displeased by a preliminary text prepared by lawyers shortly 
after midnight and wants it clarified before a deal is formally 
signed he seemed the lone holdout 
many of the 67 million citizens of quebec have said the province 
should reconsider its place in the canadian federation if the meech 
lake accord were rejected by any of the provinces 
quebec premier robert bourassa disrupted the talks thursday when 
he warned he would no longer discuss any changes in the clause 
declaring the french province a distinct society the heart of 
the accord 
this is fundamental to quebecois bourassa said as he arrived 
at the conference center in ottawa friday their first choice is 
to stay within canada and be recognized as a distinct society 
newfoundland and manitoba remained holdouts to approving the 
accord friday against the wishes of mulroney however manitoba 
political leaders said late friday they were pleased with a federal 
proposal offered earlier in the day to break the deadlock 
in a 1980 referendum quebecois rejected a proposal to open talks 
with the federal government on a plan allowing quebec political 
autonomy 
despite that vote the province refused to sign the 1982 canadian 
constitution saying quebecs french character had been ignored 
in 1987 the 10 premiers and mulroney signed the fivepoint meech 
lake accord as a constitutional amendment to appease quebec they 
gave themselves three years to win ratification 
since then elections brought new governments to newfoundland 
manitoba and new brunswick and the new premiers reneged on the 
signatures of their predecessors 
now polls show nationalist sentiment is on the rise in quebec 
and a growing number of quebecois are again ready to break away from 
canada either totally or in some sort of autonomy arrangement with 
ottawa 
during this weeks talks new brunswick premier frank mckenna 
said his concerns had been addressed and he would support the accord 
canada has 25 million residents onefourth of them in quebec 
most of canadas population lives within 100 miles of the us 
border

president bush and mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari have decided to open negotiations to reach a 
usmexican free trade agreement according to administration 
officials 
bush and salinas will meet sunday night laying the groundwork 
for a formal announcement of their decision by the white house on 
monday 
completion of a free trade agreement could take years but if 
successful it would bring all of north america 335 million people 
into a single market free of tariffs and most nontariff barriers 
mexico would join the free trade zone established between the 
united states and canada two years ago 
the officials asking not to be identified said preparatory 
discussions among experts from the two sides will begin shortly with 
an eye toward getting formal negotiations under way by the time of 
the next bushsalinas meeting in december in monterrey 
the two presidents will dine at the white house on sunday night 
without aides secretary of state james a baker iii will meet with 
salinas on monday morning 
salinas who will address a gathering of business executives 
monday evening is making his visit at a time of unusual harmony in 
mexicanamerican relations 
during the 1980s disagreements over central america produced 
deep crossborder hostility 
the only significant setback recently was the usorchestrated 
kidnaping in april of a mexican doctor wanted in the 1985 murder of 
a us drug enforcement administration agent in mexico 
administration officials have consistently praised salinas for 
what they regard as his courage in confronting mexicos acute drug 
smuggling problem and in attempting to reverse eight years of 
economic decline 
in recent years mexico has moved decisively to modernize its 
economy selling off hundreds of resourcedraining state enterprises 
and joining the general agreement on tariffs and trade the latter 
move has led to significant trade liberalization 
twoway usmexican trade totals about 52 billion but experts 
consider this figure to be far below the potential 
salinas who took office in december 1988 initially was cool to 
the idea of a free trade pact but since has become a strong 
proponent 
after the mexican senate gave salinas the green light last month 
to seek an fta with the united states he said mexico will not be 
left out of the new world configuration the speed of the changes 
requires decisive answers on all fronts in all markets 
many mexicans have been concerned that the united states with 
its more developed economy would overwhelm mexico under an fta but 
those fears have gradually abated and much of the remaining 
opposition is confined to mexican labor unions 
a recent report by the heritage foundation a conservative think 
tank said a usmexican fta would offer the best hope for mexico 
to join the ranks of the worlds prosperous countries 
many mexican products currently are denied access to us 
markets including steel textiles and some agricultural goods 
as the heritage study points out a more prosperous mexico would 
reduce the incentive for many mexicans to emigrate illegally to the 
united states 
compared with the united states mexicos own market is far more 
protectionist and most economists believe this has contributed to 
the countrys economic difficulties 
an fta would be a boon to many us exporters if it also 
substantially liberalized us investment opportunities in mexico 
the result would far more business activity from which both 
countries would benefit the officials said

a 16month campaign to curb semiautomatic 
assault weapons is suddenly on hold as senate republicans and 
democrats trade shots over who scuttled an omnibus anticrime bill 
democrats blamed republicans and hardnosed lobbying by the 
national rifle association for derailing the bill republicans say 
they want to resume debate and offered a compromise to get the bill 
back on the senate floor 
but democratic leader george mitchell made it clear he was in no 
rush to resume debate after failing twice in a week to break a 
filibuster on the bill 
theres no deadline mitchell said last week as talks aimed 
at reaching a compromise got under way 
that brought republican leader bob dole to the floor to declare 
that he was ready with a compromise i urge the democrats to 
accept our good faith breakthrough on the crime front 
but mitchell said the republicans killed the crime bill by 
voting in large numbers against cutting short debate he said gop 
lawmakers now were clamoring for more action because they are 
obviously concerned about the political fallout of not getting a 
crime bill passed 
sen judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
says the chances are better than even that the senate will pass 
a crime bill this year but the house is not at work on similar 
legislation 
the senate bill would bar the import from overseas or manufacture 
in this country of nine semiautomatic assault weapons it would 
provide the death penalty for 30 federal offenses and has provisions 
to shorten delays in carrying out executions 
in addition the nations money laundering laws would be refined 
slightly under the measure 
the campaign to curb assault weapons began in january 1989 after 
a deranged man with an ak47 semiautomatic rifle opened fire on a 
stockton calif school yard leaving five dead and 30 injured 
mitchell halted floor action last week after twice failing to get 
the senate to limit debate to nearly 30 hours he said some 300 
proposed amendments were awaiting action and added that trying to 
debate all of them would merely fuel a filibuster 
the senate on tuesday voted 5437 in favor of limiting debate 
six short of the number of votes needed on thursday it voted 5737 
in favor of such a move three votes short 
the first time around 31 of those voting against a time limit 
were republicans while six were democrats 
on thursday 30 republicans and seven democrats were against 
limiting debate 
besides blaming republicans a number of democrats pointed the 
finger at the nra which sent out sharply worded mail to gun owners 
saying supporters of the assault weapons provision betrayed every 
lawabiding gun owner in the state 
the major reason is the nra sen paul simon dill 
declared they are extremely effective in getting their people 
out 
they have distorted things beyond belief he added we for 
example in our office have received literally thousands of 
communications from the nra side and one or two percent of that from 
the other side 
sen bob kerrey dneb urged national drug policy director 
william bennett to fight the efforts of the national rifle 
association to stall a desperately needed crime bill 
but the gun group was clearly not the only factor since some 
senate liberals such as sen edward m kennedy dmass an 
outspoken critic of capital punishment also voted against cutting 
short a filibuster 
and republicans denied that they were bowing to the nra in voting 
in large numbers against a time limit sen gordon humphrey rnh 
who is retiring and thus not vulnerable to reelection pressure 
said his problem was with habeas corpus provisions of the bill 
the provisions would overhaul the system under which criminal 
cases are reviewed to determine if defendants were treated in a 
constitutional manner repeated appeals under the system have caused 
delays of a decade or more in carrying out executions 
meanwhile both sides tried to whittle down the number of 
amendments to be offered from 300 in total to 12 for each party 
under terms of a compromise proposal offered by republicans 
dole said that posed little problem and offered to get right to 
work 
there will be no legislative games allowed he declared 
mitchell however said he wanted to see the specifics of the 
amendments that the republicans would offer if the measure were 
brought back to the floor then we can consider whether we want to 
accept it or make some modification he said 
besides agreeing to push on in search of an agreement the two 
sides agreed tentatively to drop two provisions of the bill 
one would have allowed courts to consider evidence gathered with 
flawed search warrants provided that police acted in good faith in 
executing the warrants 
the provision was little different from what the supreme court 
has already allowed 
republicans had wanted to permit warrantless searches a red flag 
to senate liberals who say it would fly in the face of the 
constitution 
the other provision dropped would have set up an independent 
organized crime and drug division within the justice department

president samuel k doe of liberia his capital 
under siege by rebel soldiers has retained a washington lobbyist 
for 800000 to represent his interests in the united states 
doe hired van kloberg and associates starting june 1 as fierce 
fighting with the rebels sent a flotilla of us navy ships to 
evacuate thousands of americans their dependents and other 
foreigners from liberia hundreds of americans are being flown out 
of the west african nation this weekend on chartered planes 
the firms owner edward van kloberg flew to the liberian 
capital of monrovia a week ago to finalize the deal a spokesman 
said last week the contract filed with the justice departments 
office of foreign lobbyists is for 800000 over a 19month period 
doe doesnt need public relations right now obviously said 
mike hogan a spokesman for the lobbyist but liberias embassy in 
washington has been shut down since the fighting intensified in 
recent weeks and doe needed someone to represent him here hogan 
said 
doe has been widely accused of mismanaging the liberian economy 
and his troubles have been compounded in recent months by mass 
desertions from his army and by tribal divisions 
the effort to topple doe a former army sergeant who seized power 
10 years ago in a bloody coup began dec 24 when a band of rebels 
infiltrated from neighboring ivory coast the insurgents some of 
them trained in libya are led by a former highranking liberian 
official charles taylor 
the liberian government said friday it was willing to accept a 
ceasefire and begin negotiations with the rebel army 
us officials have urged doe to negotiate with taylor but at 
the same time they also have been quietly asking several african 
governments whether they would agree to grant doe asylum 
hogan said his firms attempts to begin a dialogue with a 
representative of taylor in new york have not been successful so 
far the state department also has been trying to bring the sides to 
some accommodation 
does brother has been living here for over a year and he too 
has been representing liberia in discussions with the state 
department and other officials hogan said 
without ussupported mediation liberia appears destined to 
sink even deeper into ethnic turmoil resulting in thousands more 
deaths said a statement from van klobergs office on friday 
the release also noted that taylor had escaped in 1985 from an 
american jail where he was waiting to be extradited to liberia on 
charges of embezzling 1 million it reiterated does promise of 
last week made to appease the advancing rebel troops that he 
would hold free elections next year and would not run 
van kloberg a former administrative dean at american university 
has several african clients among them niger burkina faso and 
zaire 
he has also represented romania and iraq 
liberia was founded by descendants of freed us slaves in 1822 
and it became black africas first independent country in 1847 it 
serves as a center for us military communications and a relay 
station for voice of america broadcasts to africa 
the rebels are holding large parts of the country which is about 
the size of ohio and have reached 25 miles southwest of monrovia

the breakup of the warsaw pacts military structures this year a 
newspaper said saturday 
the statement from rainer eppelmann is one of the most radical to 
date from a member of the sovietled military alliance 
during a meeting in moscow on thursday the sevennation warsaw 
pact issued a declaration designed to reduce moscows influence over 
the alliance the pact also announced it would turn itself into an 
alliance of sovereign and equal states

a former health minister has called for the 
legalization of brothels to help fight aids and a poll made public 
saturday suggested most french people think its a good idea 
condemnations have come from across the political spectrum 
including womens rights advocates who say lifting the 44year ban 
on brothels would amount to statesanctioned slavery 
but a louis harris poll indicated strong public support for the 
suggestion by the former health minister michele barzach one of 
the few women with a high profile in french national politics 
of the 1008 people surveyed 80 percent said reopening brothels 
would help control aids by allowing closer medical supervision of 
prostitutes according to the poll 
according to unofficial estimates france has 75000 to 90000 
full or parttime prostitutes 
about 10500 cases of aids have been recorded in france since 
1982 
ms barzach a 46yearold gynecologist was health minister from 
1986 to 1988 in the conservative government of premier jacques 
chirac and many of her policies stirred controversy 
during her tenure she helped launch campaigns to reduce tobacco 
and alcohol consumption denounced surrogate motherhood cut back on 
statepaid medical benefits and led a campaign against aids that 
included scrapping a ban on condom advertisements 
the current furor was set off by an interview published thursday 
in the newspaper le monde in which ms barzach discussed the aids 
threat 
the current situation is unacceptable and frightening she 
said its necessary to reopen the licensed brothels lets 
install a genuine health system 
licensed brothels were shut down on april 13 1946 under the 
marthe richard law named for its legislative sponsor a world 
war i spy and world war ii resistance member 
ms barzach now is a deputy to chirac mayor of paris he took 
pains friday to say the brothel proposal was only her personal 
opinion not a position of their rally for the republic party 
within the ranks of the governing socialists reactions varied 
from cautious to caustic 
michele andre secretary of state for womens rights said she 
was deeply offended by the proposal to lock up women and use 
them as merchandise 
health minster claude evin said the problem of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome extended far beyond prostitutes and homosexuals 
but added i am ready to consider anything that would help stop 
the spread of aids 
french police officials in the past have expressed support for 
relegalizing brothels but they made no formal endorsement of ms 
barzachs suggestion

arthur stulls every labored breath 
reminds him of the silica dust he inhaled 60 years ago while working 
on the hawks nest tunnel 
historians say up to 700 men most of them black died of 
silicosis and other lung problems after working on the aqueduct 
bored through a deposit of nearly pure silica in gauley mountain 
other men like stull survived but still are suffering decades 
later from the effects of silica dust 
there was no protection from it said the 78yearold stull 
who lives in nearby mount lookout work was scarce then you 
couldnt find work anywhere hardly you had to take what you could 
get 
work on the 38mile aqueduct about 40 miles east of charleston 
began 60 years ago this week born in the bleak days of the great 
depression the project proved to be one of the darkest moments of 
us industrial history 
the tunnel was built by union carbide corp through a contractor 
rinehart and dennis construction co of charlottesville va the 
purpose divert the new river to a power station used at a union 
carbide smelting plant in nearby alloy 
martin cherniack a yale university assistant professor of 
occupational medicine studied the case and wrote the hawks nest 
incident in 1986 
crews blasted a 31footwide tunnel through almost pure silica a 
glassy substance found in sand and quartz then the tunnels width 
was nearly doubled to cash in on the silica so pure it could be 
used without refining at the alloy plant according to cherniack 
the whole project took about two years 
soon after work began many workers began complaining of hacking 
coughs and searing chest pains the average worker stayed on the job 
just 15 to 16 weeks cherniack said 
a company doctor at the time called the condition tunnelitis 
and gave the men tablets nicknamed little black devils 
many didnt quit in time an undertaker was paid 55 each to 
remove and bury bodies in a mass grave near summersville 
congressional records say 169 men eventually were buried there 
but with jobs hard to find reports that workers were dying 
failed to deter others men who died or fell sick and refused to go 
back to work in the tunnel were easily replaced 
the number who died while working on the tunnel or died later of 
lung diseases is only a guess because many of the more than 4000 
workers were migrants and left the area estimates range up to 700 
lengthy exposure to silica causes hard nodules to form in lungs 
until scar tissue replaces healthy tissue leaving little room to 
breathe tuberculosis and pneumonia often develop 
the hazards of silica dust were known to civil and mining 
engineers in the 1930s although company officials later claimed 
they did not know of the dangers 
cherniack concluded that racism was a factor in the deaths more 
than 75 percent of the workers were black migrants who came from 
across the south 
he wrote of a widespread attitude of condescension if not 
contempt toward the blacks many whites believed that the workers 
were dying not because of silica dust but because of poor nutrition 
or a propensity to violence 
in spite of all the evidence to the contrary some people still 
say that knifings shootings and beatings took the greatest toll 
cherniack wrote gambling out of doors before open fires in the 
cold is another supposed cause of death 
about 300 survivors and relatives filed lawsuits against rinehart 
and dennis they eventually received 130000 half of which went to 
lawyers rinehart and dennis now defunct admitted no wrongdoing 
a 1936 house labor committee investigation into the deaths 
brought unwelcome notoriety to gauley bridge it became known as 
the town of the living dead because of the many disabled workers 
who remained there until they died 
townspeople resented outside interest in the tragedy researchers 
had difficulty finding cooperative sources and sometimes were 
threatened cherniack said 
and in an unrelated dispute federal authorities contended in a 
lawsuit that union carbide should have sought federal permission 
before diverting a navigable waterway the us supreme court 
eventually decided in favor of the government in that dispute 
the tunnel is now owned by elkem metals co of pittsburgh which 
bought it along with the power plant and alloy factory from union 
carbide in 1980 
stull said he was lucky because he apparently was assigned to a 
part of the tunnel with the least amount of silica 
nevertheless he said the dust led to pneumonia and surgery to 
remove part of his lung shortly after he stopped working on the 
tunnel doctors blame the silica dust for his current lung problems 
besides the dust tunnel workers coped with gas from vehicles 
that carried the rock and steel from the tunnel he recalled 
some days the light would get awful red looking stull said 
you could tell there was gas we just went ahead and worked 
you just got used to it and didnt pay much attention

district congressional seat held by democratic rep joseph e 
brennan 
brennan served as governor until 1986 when in effect he 
swapped jobs with republican john e mckernan now brennan wants his 
old job back and will run against mckernan who incidentally is 
married to the states other us representative olympia snowe 
the democratic frontrunner in a fiveway race for brennans seat 
is attorney general james e tierney who was the unsuccessful 
democratic nominee for governor in 1986 in the twoman republican 
runoff the leading candidate is david f emery who held the seat 
for eight years before he unsuccessfully challenged us sen george 
j mitchell in 1982 
in arkansas ralph forbes a minister and former american nazi 
leader won 46 percent of the vote in last months threeway primary 
for the gop nomination for lieutenant governor 
because he fell short of a majority he was forced into a runoff 
with the secondplace finisher kenneth muskie harris the 
manager of a realty company who was a defensive back on arkansas 
razorbacks football teams 
forbes argues that racial separation is ultimately the right 
answer and cites the bible in support of his views 
arkansas republicans including gubernatorial nominee sheffield 
nelson were embarrassed by forbes strong showing and quickly 
disavowed him and endorsed harris who is black 
this election should be decided by the people from the bottom 
up not the party bosses from the top down forbes said friday 
the gop lieutenant governors race had attracted little attention 
before the primary in the heavily democratic state some in arkansas 
attributed forbes big vote to his name having been first on the 
ballot

excongressman who won a sevenway democratic primary 
in south carolina state sens ernest passailaigue and theo 
mitchell are vying for the right to take on campbell who is only 
the second republican governor in the state this century 
ill be a citizens politician not a career politician 
passailaigue says referring to campbells six years in the general 
assembly and eight years in the us house before becoming governor 
mitchell who is hoping to become the states first black 
governor calls campbell the worst governor of south carolina in 
the 20th century he said campbell catered to the wealthy and 
privileged at the expense of the working people the poor people 
the retired and elderly 
in atlantic city nj mayor james l usry and challenger jim 
whelan will ask voters to decide who can best ease the citys 
problems of poverty filth and crime 
usry the citys first black mayor and a former school 
administrator faces the extra obstacle of a pending political 
corruption indictment 
whelan a white city councilman and swimming instructor has 
avoided bringing up the indictment his campaign seeks to portray 
him as the candidate who can appeal to blacks and whites in the city 
of 35400 
north dakotas initiative measure would push the sales tax up 
from 5 percent to 6 percent for a year raising an estimated 42 
million most of that would go to elementary and secondary 
education making up for drastic cuts in the education budget 
imposed after voters rejected a series of tax increases last

prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
travels to washington monday expecting to hear criticism of 
lackluster efforts fight drug trafficking and the failure to stop 
the piracy of us copyrights patents and trademarks 
although still staunch allies relations have been frayed in 
recent years by issues ranging from washingtons subsidies for 
american rice farmers to moves by american cigarette companies to 
penetrate the closed thai market 
but on major global and foreign policy issues including the 
conflict in cambodia the two countries are normally in close 
agreement 
chatichai is to meet with president bush at the white house 
thursday near the end of his us visit 
the thai leader is expected to explain his countrys recent 
initiatives to end the 11yearold war in neighboring cambodia 
thailand and the united states back a threeparty guerrilla 
coalition fighting the vietnamesesupported government in phnom penh 
the thais have tried to get the four warring factions to agree to 
a ceasefire but at a conference in tokyo last week the khmer rouge 
guerrillas refused to sign the pact and fighting continues 
narcotics is expected to head the agenda since massive amounts 
of heroin flow through thailand to the united states from the 
socalled golden triangle of southeast asia 
earlier this year a us assistant secretary of state melvin 
levitsky said corruption in thailand was a major obstacle to 
fighting drugs in southeast asia other us officials have alleged 
that narcoticsrelated corruption infects the highest levels of the 
military government and business 
in july 1989 the united states issued a warrant for the arrest of 
maj gen vech petborom an assistant police inspector on charges 
of being part of a ring smuggling drugs into the united states the 
thais have yet to take final action in the case but it appears vech 
will not be criminally prosecuted in thailand 
last march a warrant on similar charges was issued for changchi 
fu the socalled opium warlord of the golden triangle the lawless 
border area of burma laos and thailand although he operates from 
burmese territory the powerful trafficker is known to have a 
network of legal and illicit operations in thailand 
the thais have a small core of dedicated antinarcotics officers 
and have done a laudable job in stopping the production of opium 
from which heroin is refined on their own territory through crop 
substitution programs 
but thailand remains the main transit country for heroin from 
burma and laos where the opium harvests this year are expected by 
the us state department to total 2600 tons us officials say at 
least 40 percent to 50 percent of the heroin imported into the 
united states originates in the triangle 
in recent weeks local newspapers have reported that chatichai 
may offer to step up the war against drugs in exchange for american 
leniency on trade and intellectual property issues washintgon has 
threatened to further penalize thailand under us trade laws if 
greater action isnt taken to stop the piracy of american 
copyrights patents and trademarks 
thailand is regarded as one of the worst offenders in asia 
unlicensed copies of hollywood videotapes walt disney clothing 
lines american computer software and other products are openly sold 
in thailand american pharmaceutical products are similarly pirated 
six us senators last week criticized the seeming lack of 
commitment by the thai government 
american businessmen are losing scores of millions of dollars 
per year because thai laws to prevent piracy are inadequate and are 
not enforced said a letter from the senators addressed to the 
thai ambassador in washington 
thailand is already on the us trade representatives priority 
watch list for its failure to protect intellectual property 
rights and last year washington began to deny dutyfree benefits 
for about 165 million of thai imports 
the issue is regarded as a serious one in thailand because the 
united states is the countrys most important export market last 
year the thais enjoyed a 14 billion trade surplus on exports to 
the united states 
the 68yearold chatichai has been an army general diplomat 
successful businessman and veteran politician holding numerous 
cabinet posts in past governments although a generally popular and 
democratically elected figure chatichais government has been 
accused by opposition parties of massive corruption

as polarized southern baptists converge for 
their annual convention a church historian said the grand 
compromise that has held the denomination together for 145 years 
is falling apart 
its amazing that the denomination has lasted as long as it did 
intact considering its heritage of individualism and diversity 
said bill j leonard a professor at southern baptist theological 
seminary in louisville ky 
denominationalists have been masters at maintaining the 
balance despite repeated attempts through the years to upset it 
ever since the denomination was founded in 1845 he said in a 
telphone interview 
since then the broad compact that affirmed classic christian 
beliefs while allowing varied interpretations has held together 
but now with the diffusion of southern culture and steps by the 
controlling fundamentalist wing to draw narrower lines of 
thought the old inclusive coalition is crumbling he said 
about 35000 messengers from churches across the country were 
expected for the convention opening tuesday in the louisiana 
superdome preceded by rival pastors conferences running through 
monday 
leonard foresaw no abrupt denominational breakup regardless of 
how the voting turns out between fundamentalist and moderate 
factions but he predicted spreading fragmentation of the 
149millionmember denomination the nations largest protestant 
body 
leonard details his analysis in a book gods last and only 
hope the fragmentation of the southern baptist convention 
it offers the most comprehensive treatment yet of a conflict that 
began in 1979 when fundamentalists launched a drive to purge the 
denomination of liberal tendencies and personnel 
that faction which insists on a literalistic view of the bible 
and various rightwing social positions has dominated annual 
conventions for 11 years gradually achieving majorities of trustees 
of denominational agencies and seminaries 
the fight centers on election of the denominations president 
who indirectly controls selection of trustees 
fudamentalists are backing the rev morris chapman pastor of 
first baptist church of wichita falls texas moderates support the 
rev daniel vestal pastor of dunwoody baptist church in suburban 
atlanta 
in his book leonard the 44yearold head of the faculty 
organization at the denominations oldest flagship seminary in 
louisville calls the struggle the controversy 
it has polarized almost ever segment of convention life 
leonard writes with fundamentalists denounced as totalitarians 
and hit men and moderates condemned as skunks and 
termites undermining right belief 
noting that virtually all southern baptists are theological 
conservatives affirming biblical authority leonard says 
fundamentalists seek a particular doctrinal uniformity grounded 
primarily in the dogma of biblical inerrancy 
that theory holds that the bible is without error about history 
science religion and all other matters 
many moderates also hold a fundamentalist view of scripture as 
do both presidential candidates but leonard points out moderates 
oppose efforts to impose such dogmas on the entire denomination 
in the past occasional doctrinal disputes passed because a 
prevailing southern culture held diverse views together leonard 
writes 
that unity was grounded in the grand compromise in which 
ideologues on the right or left were not allowed to control the 
center he says adding 
the denomination became a means of uniting those of various 
regional theological and liturgical traditions and holding at bay 
those who sought to impose a narrower doctrinal or ecclesiastical 
norms on the entire body 
despite recurrent temporary disputes he says the denomination 
became one of the most most organized efficient numerically 
successful ecclesiastical bodies in north america 
but with the fading of the distinctive southern identity that for 
so long held the denomination together leonard says the new drive 
for conformity in belief has shattered the old coaliton 
fundamentalists sought to establish a more explicitly 
theological identity for the denomination and insure conformity 
leonard writes those who do not accept their formulas and 
definitions are excluded from representation on convention boards of 
trustees 
their efforts have narrowed the theological parameters of the 
sbc considerably and upset the delicate balance that the 
denomination had so long struggled with amazing success to 
maintain 
unlike past disputes he says only the current controversy has 
featured an attempt to appoint people of a single ideological 
persuasion to convention boards and agencies until now convention 
appointments reflected a wide diversity of perspectives 
he says moderates continue to believe the pendulum will swing 
back to the conservative center while fundamentalists believe they 
can maintain the old denominational triumphalism and success and 
control the old coalition after having destroyed it 
unity seems impossible but separation seems unthinkable he 
concludes intrigue and inertia triumph southern baptists 
approach the 21st century having squandered much of their spiritual 
vitality and their considerable resources on a controvery in which 
they turned in on themselves rather than confront a complex world

three temblors shook an area in the northern 
jungle that was devastated by an earlier earthquake killing eight 
people and injuring 37 authorities said saturday 
meanwhile in perus southern andes mountains the sabancaya 
volcano continued to belch smoke and gas and spew ashes and rocks 
over a sixmile radius ruining crops and forcing hundreds of people 
from their homes 
two of the earthquakes struck about midnight friday and another 
hit near dawn on saturday said a spokesman for the national 
geophysical institute in lima 
the institute said it did not have a reading on the intensity of 
the tremors 
an earthquake in the region on may 29 measured 63 on the richter 
scale and killed at least 56 people wounded 800 and left thousands 
homeless 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by a quake as 
recorded by a seismograph and a temblor measuring 6 can cause 
severe damage 
the quake zone is in an agricultural area about 400 miles north 
of lima the capital it includes the villages of soritor porvenir 
and nuevo cajamarca and the cities of rioja and moyobamba 
hardest hit in the earlier earthquake was soritor where at least 
23 people died the town six miles south of moyobamba was almost 
destroyed 
more than 70 aftershocks were registered in the days after the 
initial quake all with epicenters around the rioja area 
many people in the earthquake zone are still without shelter and 
are sleeping in the streets 
scientists were monitoring activity at the sabancaya volcano 
which began rumbling and spitting ash on june 3 hundreds of farmers 
and villagers have since moved off the mountain to safe areas 
the 21000foot volcano is 430 miles southeast of lima and 50 
miles northwest of arequipa perus secondlargest city scientists 
said an eruption would not endanger arequipa which has a population 
of 700000

justice harry a blackmun says he is one of the 
supreme courts three old goats whose inevitable departure will 
solidify conservative domination of the court for the next 40 or 50 
years 
labeled a conservative when he joined the court two decades ago 
blackmun now is an outspoken critic of the courts rightward shift 
he demonstrated his candor during an interview with the associated 
press 
last year the cluster of five conservative members emerged 
and certainly this year they have control of the court completely 
and are making the most of it blackmun said 
he listed chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron 
r white sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
as members of the courts conservative majority 
i had a feeling until last year that while they could have had 
control of the court they didnt really seize it the 81yearold 
justice said 
i suppose as long as i am not a member of that group it is 
difficult but we shouldnt resent it he said thats the way 
the system works that pendulum swings it will stay this way now 40 
or 50 years im sure 
blackmun who saturday marked his 20th anniversary as a justice 
predicts the court will grow more conservative after the departure 
of its three octogenarians himself and justices william j 
brennan 84 and thurgood marshall 81 
none of the three has indicated he is considering retirement 
brennan and marshall are the courts most liberal members often 
joined in the most divisive cases by blackmun and justice john paul 
stevens 70 
time will take its toll on the three old goats blackmun 
said we will be replaced by appointees of the current 
administration or the next one which is probably going to be 
another bush administration so it seems to me that before too long 
the court could be nine conservatives and that surely will last 
well into the next century 
when appointed by president nixon blackmun had the reputation of 
a politically and judicially conservative federal appeals court 
judge from minnesota 
early in his high court tenure he was ridiculed for his 
perceived dependence on thenchief justice warren e burger an old 
friend even after blackmun wrote the courts 1973 roe vs wade 
decision legalizing abortion he was considered a dependable 
conservative vote 
by 1980 however he had emerged as an independent force on the 
court in the past decade he increasingly sided with the liberal 
wing 
i dont believe ive changed in fundamental outlook blackmun 
said if one goes back and reads my opinions on the court of 
appeals youll find that they are not rockribbed conservatism of 
the type that seems to be popular today 
as a lower court judge blackmun said he and his colleagues 
always had the comfort of knowing that if were wrong those nine 
jokers down in washington will straighten us out here its the end 
of the line when one gets here he has to develop an indepth 
judicial philosophy 
he added one has to develop his attitude toward the 
constitutions great phrases what does equal protection mean 
what is cruel and unusual punishment i would hope that i have 
grown in that respect over the years but as far as shifting from 
conservatism to liberalism i dont believe i have done that 
on the bench blackmun most often displays a judicial scowl and 
can be snappish with lawyers off the bench warmth and humor 
emerge the justice turns downright effusive when discussing his 
three daughters and grandchildren or swapping baseball gossip 
he is less willing to discuss the possibility of retirement 
i think one has to have good health in this job i dont 
believe one can keep up without it and i am very conscious of the 
fact that some former colleagues of mine who were my age are long 
gone blackmun said 
after noting that he undergoes a complete physical exam at the 
mayo clinic each year blackmun smiled and said there are two or 
three out there who promise they will let me know when my level of 
senility reaches the unacceptable point 
blackmun has suffered from recurring cancer of the prostate 
gland most recently he was treated for it in 1987 no further 
problems have been reported 
blackmun realizes his role in court history will be defined 
largely by his writing the roe vs wade decision author of the 
abortion decision he once said we all pick up tags ill carry 
this one to my grave 
he has remained an ardent defender of a womans right to end her 
pregnancy and last year dissented bitterly from a decision that gave 
states more power to regulate abortion 
but blackmun said he hopes other aspects of his tenure will not 
be eclipsed i hope i would be remembered as a person of judicial 
integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one 
field he told the ap 
id like to be known just as a good worker in the vineyard who 
held his own and contributed generally to the advancement of the 
law

sen dave durenbergers finances go under a 
public microscope tuesday as the senate ethics committee holds its 
first hearings in nine years on whether a lawmaker abused his office 
the committee scheduled two grueling weeks of triallike 
proceedings that could have enormous political consequences for the 
minnesota republican whose term runs through 1994 
there would be pressure on him to quit if the committee found 
serious wrongdoing minnesota republican chairman robert weinholzer 
said in an interview that would allow democratic gov rudy perpich 
to appoint a democrat to the seat 
the ethics committee has found substantial credible evidence 
that durenberger broke senate rules or federal law in transactions 
involving his former minneapolis condominium and a book promotion 
deal 
free limousine rides for personal trips accepted from groups 
interested in legislation also may have been improper the 
committee said 
durenberger 55 has remained silent about the case in recent 
weeks but last december he apologized to minnesotans for mistakes 
and lapses in judgment 
durenberger said he never intended to circumvent senate rules 
nonetheless a minneapolis star tribune poll in march found 79 
percent of those surveyed thought durenberger should resign if found 
to have committed ethics violations 
the newspaper reported saturday that the senate committee on 
friday presented a subpoena to minnesota commerce commissioner tom 
borman about durenberger loans from the commercial state bank of st 
paul 
in february the newspaper reported that durenberger received 
nearly 1 million in loans from the bank during the past decade no 
collateral was required for 21 loans during that period and six were 
offered at unusually low interest rates 
durenberger and bank officers have denied any impropriety 
the loan issue would not be raised at the senate hearings unless 
the committee specifically made the matter part of its 
investigation a term that defines the final stage of an ethics 
probe the committee first would have to find substantial credible 
evidence that wrongdoing occurred 
many facts in the case are not in dispute committee chairman 
howell t heflin dala and vice chairman warren b rudman 
rnh said durenbergers motivations could play a major role in 
determining guilt or innocence 
following the hearings the panel of three republicans and three 
democrats will decide whether durenberger broke the senates rules 
or federal law if so punishment ranging from a mild rebuke to 
expulsion could be recommended to the senate findings of 
lawbreaking would be referred to federal agencies 
at the hearings washington lawyer robert s bennett hired by 
the committee will serve as prosecutor jim hamilton a former 
counsel to the senate watergate committee will represent 
durenberger neither is a stranger to the ethics committee 
bennett played the role of prosecutor in 1981 in the case of 
former sen harrison a williams jr dnj when the committee 
last held triallike proceedings to determine ethical wrongdoing 
the committee began its investigation after williams already had 
been convicted in federal court on nine bribery and conspiracy 
counts in the abscam political corruption scandal bennett 
recommended expulsion and the full senate was about to oust williams 
in march 1982 when he resigned 
hamilton represented former sen herman e talmadge dga 
before the committee in a 1979 financial misconduct case the 
committee found wrongdoing and urged the senate to denounce 
talmadge which it did 
there has been intense interest in the durenberger case in 
minnesota where the proceedings will be broadcast live on public 
radio stations and will receive heavy taped television coverage 
weinholzer said if the hearings are not too damaging 
durenberger has plenty of time to regain the trust of the people 
if the hearings go very badly weinholzer added his 
effectiveness as a senator would be diminished and pressure on him 
to resign could grow 
democrats in minnesota and in washington have declined to exploit 
durenbergers troubles its between the senator and his 
colleagues at this point said anita dunn spokeswoman for the 
democratic senatorial campaign committee 
durenbergers friends in the senate are defending him 
you would have a lot of congressmen and senators who would fail 
to shine under the microscope said sen don nickles rokla 
chairman of the republican senatorial campaign committee i dont 
think were looking at a scenario that would lead to his forced 
resignation 
the committee has filed charges against durenberger on two 
separate occasions 
on may 14 the committee told him it would examine certain 
transactions involving a condominium in minneapolis that 
durenberger partly owned as well as your receipt of senate 
reimbursements for using the condominium between august 1983 and 
midnovember 1989 
the investigation will examine whether you may have abused your 
united states senate office and misused senate funds through a 
pattern of improper conduct which brings discredit upon the united 
states senate the committee said 
on march 1 the panel informed durenberger it would investigate a 
book deal in which the senator earned 100000 in 198586 for 
promoting two books he wrote on defense and health issues

a tanker with more than 38 million 
gallons of crude oil on board was rocked by explosions and fire off 
the gulf coast early today killing at least two crew members 
officials said 
a small oil slick was reported near the 853foot norwegian tanker 
mega borg but the us coast guard said there was apparently no 
damage to the cargo hold but as the fire continued to burn there 
were still fears that the ship could be damaged enough to trigger a 
larger spill 
the fire is still out of control and the coast guard has rated 
it as a mediumprobabilitypotential major spill coast guard 
lt cmdr thomas leveille said late this morning 
the coast guard said the tanker was burning 57 miles southeast of 
galveston after an explosion in the engine room about 1 am a 
200foot section at the rear of the ship was still burning out of 
control hours later 
the tanker had transferred 70000 barrels of its 980000 barrels 
of crude oil to the italian tanker framura when an explosion ripped 
through the borgs engine room coast guard capt tom greene said at 
a news conference in galveston the remainder 910000 barrels 
translates into 3822 million gallons 
of the crew of about 40 two were dead two were missing and 
presumed dead and the others were evacuated the coast guard said 
some of the evacuees were injured but none seriously 
shortly before noon flames could be seen shooting hundreds of 
feet into the air as thick black smoke curled from the ships aft 
section two fire boats sprayed jets of water on the flames and two 
coast guard cutters stood by the smoke could be seen 40 miles away 
the tanker did not appear to be listing 
coast guard lt cmdr thomas leveille said a very very 
little amount of oil had spilled out of the top of the tanks and 
into the gulf as the fire heated the oil and it expanded the spill 
is not due to a leak in the ships tanks he said 
our greatest concern is that the fire is going to cause 
structural damage to the bulkhead between the pump room and the 
cargo tanks leveille said if that were to happen wed have 
the potential for a fairly large spill we dont believe that is 
going to happen 
greene said authorities immediate fear is that the fire might 
spread to three cargo tanks nearest the engine room that hold a 
total of 360000 barrels or roughly 15 million gallons of the light 
crude 
but greene said the possibility of the tanker sinking was 
slight 
we dont know what caused the spark or the fire or whatever 
but there were explosions and while our helicopters were on the 
scene they witnessed another explosion so its a pretty hot 
fire petty officer george wilson said earlier in houston 
ensign larry meredith of the coast guards marine safety office 
in galveston said the spilled oil should not threaten any beaches on 
the gulf of mexico but the marine safety office is monitoring the 
situation and would expedite cleanup efforts if the situation 
suddenly changed 
we dont expect any of the oil to reach the texas coast 
meredith siad it will mix with natural ocean water and if 
nature takes its course evaporate being 50 60 miles off the 
coast we just expect it to evaporate 
hawes said the tanker carries a norwegian flag the mega borg was 
coming from palanca angola and its next port of call after 
galveston was scheduled to be aruba 
the mega borgs captain and first mate escaped and are aboard the 
coast guard cutter cushing 
the other surviving crew members were being taken to freeport 
aboard the commercial vessel patricia m some of them were injured 
but none critically said shoul the most serious injury is a broken 
leg and others are suffering from bruised ribs or smoke inhalation 
he said 
the tanker is owned by ks megaborg ii of farsund norway its 
us agent is biehl and co of galveston

heavy rains forced the temporary evacuation 
of up to 10000 people today including 2000 living near a manmade 
lake whose retaining wall was in danger of collapse authorities 
said 
but by midday the weather was improving and officials said most 
residents would be able to return home later today 
gov richard celeste visited buckeye lake after declaring licking 
county in a state of emergency because of flooding and the threat of 
collapse of the wall that partially surrounds the lake he said he 
would ask president bush to declare licking county a disaster area 
if that wall goes that whole area is going to be underwater 
randy spiker deputy director of the licking county disaster 
services agency said earlier today 
the evacuations in licking county began shortly before dawn the 
national weather service said 2 to 4 inches of rain fell overnight 
in central and north central ohio 
about 50 ohio national guard troops helped volunteers reinforce 
the wall with sandbags and assisted with evacuations of about 2000 
residents of buckeye lake about 30 miles east of columbus 
the state has been battered by heavy rains since thursday 
weather service forecasters said rainfall could total 6 inches in 
some areas many areas were so soaked that any additional rainfall 
was sure to cause localized flooding the weather service said 
because of the prospect of flooding at buckeye lake 12 miles of 
interstate 70 were closed for a short time this morning said 
beverly schell dispatcher at the granville post of the state 
highway patrol she said some exits remained blocked to all but 
emergency traffic 
this morning there were three small leaks in the earthen wall 
that partially surrounds buckeye lake while the fear that they 
would grow into larger leaks had ebbed by midday the situation 
would still be monitored authorities said 
edward l frank who manages the lake for the ohio department of 
natural resources said if we had gotten the amount of water we 
expected around 3 am life in these parts would have changed 
radically but frank said he believed the lake would maintain its 
present level and the wall would withstand the pressure 
the 3400acre buckeye lake covers parts of three central ohio 
counties it was created in the 19th century to hold water for the 
ohio canal 
about 2000 residents of the town of buckeye lake were evacuated 
in addition flooding forced the evacuation of about 3000 people in 
south newark living near the licking river and campers at a 
racetrack authorities said spiker said as many as 5000 other 
county residents may have been displaced temporarily while others 
had been asked be on standby for possible evacuation orders 
several evacuation centers were set up around the county 
celeste declared a state of emergency activating the ohio 
national guard and summoning equipment from the ohio department of 
transportation said stacie gilg public information officer for the 
ohio emergency management agency 
tornados and thunderstorms sparked localized flooding around 
ohio there were no reports of major damage but a wayne county man 
was missing and feared drowned after falling from a dam 
the friday night storms followed a round of heavy rain that

five years after a jury found claus von 
bulow innocent of trying to murder his heiress wife martha 
sunny von bulow his exwife remains in a coma and his 
stepdaughter still believes hes guilty 
but annielaurie isham says she is not bitter and adds you go 
on to cope with life 
the case fascinated the public and national television carried 
the verdict live on june 10 1985 when von bulow was acquitted at 
his second trial three years earlier he had been found guilty 
the second ruling was an unbelievable conclusion to a few 
nightmarish years for ms isham 
mrs von bulow 59 is at columbiapresbyterian hospital in new 
york city in a coma that doctors say is irreversible 
von bulow was accused of attempting to murder her by injecting 
her with insulin in december 1979 and again in december 1980 she 
recovered from the first coma but went into a permanent coma a year 
later defense attorneys argued that mrs von bulow brought on the 
comas herself through alcohol and drug abuse 
millions of people debated the merits of the evidence and 
speculation continues even today a lot of people are 
unconvinced of von bulows innocence said alan dershowitz the 
harvard law professor who masterminded von bulows successful 
appeal von bulow did not return calls left on an answering machine 
at his london home 
a movie starring glenn close jeremy irons and ron silver is 
likely to add to the controversy and return the von bulow case to 
the limelight with its release this fall 
it leaves much for the audience to infer said dershowitz 
who wrote the book reversal of fortune on which the movie is 
based dershowitzs son elon is a coproducer 
ms isham 32 who called the film a commercialization of a 
tragedy said time has helped heal her grief 
you dont always walk around with a horrible load on your 
back she said in a recent telephone interview from new york 
you miss the people that youve lost and then you go on she 
said its like others who have lost a parent 
but ms isham and her 31yearold brother alexander von 
auersperg were not always so benevolent 
after von bulows acquittal they filed a 56 million civil suit 
alleging the danish socialite tried to kill their mother to inherit 
her money 
it was settled out of court in 1987 von bulow now 63 agreed to 
divorce his wife and renounce all claims to her fortune including 
the 120000ayear trust fund created for him before she lapsed 
into a coma on dec 27 1980 his share of her estate was estimated 
at 25 million 
he also agreed to give up any rights to book or movie deals about 
the family infighting 
in exchange the von bulows daughter cosima was restored as 
full heiress to onethird of her maternal grandmothers 100 million 
pittsburg utilities fortune the 23yearold had been cut out of 
annielaurie aitkens will for siding with her father in the family 
feud 
relations between the siblings remain strained but time has 
helped there too ms von bulow attended her half sisters wedding 
last summer said maureen connelly a von auersperg spokeswoman 
as a result of the trials ms isham and her brother set up the 
national victims center the texasbased organization serves 
violentcrime victims and their relatives 
we really found that coming out of the trial particularly from 
personal experience we found out how victims are treated in the 
judicial process ms isham said 
ms isham whose father prince alfred alfie von auersperg 
is in a coma as a result of a 1983 car accident also set up the 
sunny von bulow coma and head trauma research foundation a 
nonprofit research and education organization 
the last 10 years have been absolute misery and in the 
beginning the reasons to go into these things were personal she 
said but it really goes on to take a life of its own i can no 
longer say the reason i do it is personal 
as for von bulow 
claus von bulow will be forever remembered for this case 
said dershowitz he was an obscure man before and hed like to be 
an obscure man now the trial changed his life drastically

brivelagaillarde france ap about 300 survivors of the nazi 
concentration camp at dachau reunited saturday remembering the joys 
of liberation by us troops 45 years ago and the horrors that went 
before 
participants said the gathering in this southcentral town was 
the largest such reunion ever and the first to which eastern 
europeans were free to attend 
if we must force ourselves to forgive we do not have the right 
to forget or to let others forget said retired gen andre 
delpech 65 a french resistance fighter tortured by the gestapo in 
1943 and sent to dachau five miles north of munich west germany 
as long as there are living witnesses they have the duty to 
testify so future generations will know thats why were here 
he said during the reunion at the edmond michelet center 
the center is a resistance museum named after a dachau survivor 
and resistance leader who had lived in this town 300 miles southwest 
of paris 
jacques songy 66 recalled the day the camps 30000 prisoners 
were freed by young hearty american soldiers on april 29 1945 tens 
of thousands of other prisoners did not live to see the day 
the troops wept and vomited as they discovered naked corpses 
piled 10 feet high the stench of burning bodies skeletal survivors 
ravaged by hunger disease and nazi doctors sadistic experiments 
songy said 
i was able to make my way out of the infirmary when suddenly i 
saw a soldier take off his helmet there was this beautiful head of 
long blond hair it was such a shock to see a woman he said 
songy later learned the woman was american photojournalist 
margaret bourke white whose pictures of dachau were seen around the 
world 
i was so ashamed to be seen in such a state of physical 
deterioration said songy who at the time was 23 and had 
shriveled to only 65 pounds 
built in march 1933 dachau was the first of hundreds of nazi 
concentration camps that housed racial enemies of the state 
inmates at dachau included jews communists clergymen and other 
opponents of the nazi regime 
nazi records say nearly 32000 prisoners died there but 
thousands of other deaths were not registered the records say 
altogether 206000 prisoners were kept at dachau although the 
actual number is believed to be much higher 
although dachau had showers equipped as gas chambers historians 
say it was not the site of mass exterminations like auschwitz and 
treblinka an estimated 6 million jews were murdered by the nazis 
many prisoners at dachau worked until they died from exhaustion 
malnourishment beatings torture and harassament disease and cold 
pierre schillio at 13 the youngest french prisoner at dachau 
remembers his father urging fellow inmates not to exert themselves 
even if meant an extra ration of dried bread 
so many didnt listen to him they lost their strength and 
died schillio 60 said in an emotional interview 
escape was virtually impossible dachau was surrounded by thick 
concrete walls electrified barbed wire and deep moats watchtowers 
were manned round the clock those caught were hanged 
the highlight of the weekend reunion was an exhibition of 
memorabilia from dachau including documents and photographs many 
never before displayed in france 
the show has drawn more than 2000 visitors mostly young people 
since it opened 10 days ago 
no matter how much you read about the camps theres a shock 
when you see the pictures said natalie a 15yearold girl from 
the town you cant believe human beings could do this to other 
human beings 
several eastern europeans enjoying free travel allowed by their 
reformed governments attended the conference for the first time 
since dachau survivors in france formed an association in 1946 
lamicale des anciens de dachau has held yearly reunions but none 
as big this weekends 
many survivors said they looked forward to the annual meetings 
look how they throw themselves into each others arms the 
agony fear and degradation they suffered make them closer than 
brothers said mimi arnould 86 widow of a past association 
president 
im always moved by these elderly survivors who resisted hitler 
and suffered so much because they chose not to collaborate like so 
many others in france said max mannheim 70 a czechborn jew who 
survived auschwitz and dachau 
camp survivors on saturday attended the opening of two new 
exhibition rooms at the edmond michelet center the participants 
paid special tribute to edmond michelet who later became a cabinet 
minister under president charles de gaulle 
michelet was arrested and deported to dachau in july 1943 he 
became known as the camp chaplain ministering to the sick and 
boosting the morale of fellow prisoners he volunteered to disenfect 
typhusridden areas and soon fell ill 
we were both delirious with fever songy said but somehow 
with michelet next to me under the same blanket i felt protected 
he was like a father to me he said tears welling in his eyes 
michelet later served in several posts under de gaulle including 
justice minister during the algerian war of independence he died in 
1970

arab leaders on saturday condemned the new 
rightwing government in israel and blamed the united states for 
allowing the jewish state to pursue hardline policies against the 
palestinians 
arab leaders also called on the united states to link aid to 
israel with cooperation in mideast peace efforts 
the arab call came in a letter given monday to robert pelletreau 
the us ambassador in tunis where the arab league is 
headquartered it was made available to the associated press in 
cyprus on saturday the letter was drafted on instructions from the 
arab league summit in baghdad may 2830 
the arab countries expect the united states to make a link 
between aid extended to israel and israels cooperation with peace 
efforts such a step would restore credibility to the us middle 
east policy and start a new era in the history of arabamerican 
relations the letter said 
it also called on the united states to adopt practical steps 
to keep israel from using us aid to set up new settlements for 
soviet jewish immigrants in israelioccupied territories 
an expansion of settlements in the occupied lands is among the 
policies of the new israeli coalition formed friday by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir parliament will vote on whether to approve 
the new government soon 
the coalition also pledged to uproot the 30monthold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and 
renewed israels refusal to talk with the palestine liberation 
organization which it regards as a terrorist group 
in jordan foreign minister marwan kassem said the new israeli 
government would have negative effects in the region 
in its current formula and with shamirs statements of his 
governments policies all hopes for a just and comprehensive peace 
in the middle east are destroyed he said during a break in a 
parliamentary session 
kuwait state radio said the new israeli governments program was 
a blueprint for war and declared the united states would be held 
responsible for any israeli aggression against arab countries 
kassem also called on the united states to maintain its 
18monthold dialogue with the plo which most arabs consider the 
sole negotiating agent for the worlds 5 million palestinians 
president bush said on friday he was considering halting those 
talks due to a thwarted seaborne attempt to attack targets in israel 
mounted by the palestine liberation front a plo faction 
bush suggested that if the talks were to continue plo chairman 
yasser arafat should publicly condemn the attack arafat has denied 
involvement in the assault but refused to condemn it 
washington opened talks with the plo in december 1988 after 
arafat renounced terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
saudi arabias okaz newspaper said the new israeli coalitions 
policies will mean the deportation of palestinians from the occupied 
lands constituting a grave situation which we must confront 
the official syrian daily althawra called the israeli coalition 
a government of extremists 
bahrains akhbar alkhaleej daily blamed the united states for 
the hysterical extremist trends pervading israel now through the 
unconditional political and material support it provides

memo to donald trump 
maybe the repo men havent taken the trump princess maybe your 
checkcashing agency hasnt accused you of turning paper to rubber 
but its clear that youve fallen on hard times your name has not 
been affixed to any new edifice sporting event or species in a 
week maybe two 
you havent asked for any advice perhaps you are too humble but 
that hasnt prevented experts and some nonexperts from passing 
along a few suggestions on how to deal with your personal crisis 
your cash crisis your image crisis 
attorney marvin mitchelson says that if he were sitting in your 
financial house hed pull the window shades 
its a good time to lower the profile a little and let things 
work themselves out a bit says the celebrated celebrity divorce 
lawyer and with your spare time he suggests some leisure reading 
id reread the book trump the art of the deal 
victor kiam the guy who plugs his own razors in television 
commercials feels sympathy for a fellow entrepreneur who must take 
very unsatisfying steps but he is encouraging if you rebound 
your fall will be forgotten 
i would just keep hanging tough says quarterback doug 
flutie who was paid about 4 million to play one season with the 
trumpowned new jersey generals of the nowdefunct united states 
football league 
hes a great negotiator so id negotiate to the hilt says 
bob woolf who negotiated the deal for flutie 
i would just as hes doing sit with my bankers and try and 
restructure my debt said abraham wallach senior vice president 
of first capital management ltd a new yorkbased real estate firm 
david peterson a vice president of the american collectors 
association a minneapolisbased trade group of more than 3500 bill 
collection agencies passes along some advice more commonly given to 
more common people 
if you have trouble paying your bills you need to tell your 
creditors that youre having a problem set up a repayment plan and 
stick to it 
not everyone is eager to advise you entertainer and fellow 
casino owner merv griffin you remember how you boasted of getting 
the better of him in trading casinos the struggling resorts 
international for the taj mahal said through a publicist i 
dont comment or talk about other peoples problems 
financial analyst marvin roffman fired under pressure from trump 
after he said the taj was a bad deal would change the trump style 
of management you dont embarrass people he says 
you dont go around badmouthing your spouse or your 
executives i think thats the kind of actions that are bad for the 
morale of everybody there 
mitchelson has a few words to say about your separation from 
ivana its no crime to go through a divorce or separation 
robert kavesh a professor of finance and economics at the stern 
school of business at new york university says hold your head up 
proudly and ps prepare to sell your assets 
i think on balance trump has taken a bad rap kavesh said 
theres that mixture of envy and resentment thats frequently 
lodged against a successful person the fact is in most of his 
dealings hes been quite clean and above board 
but james grant author of grants interest rate observer and 
a prominent critic of debtfinanced wheeling and dealing offers a 
plan of action 
if i were donald trump i would sue ivana for divorce and get a 
25 million settlement with that id put everything down on the 
new york state lottery and win i think thats the most sensible 
thing he says

project star has turned on many young 
people in kansas city to the high of keeping their friends while 
turning down their offers of alcohol or drugs it takes more than 
just saying no 
we investigated the programs based on being scared or morals 
and they just dont work said project founder ewing kauffman 
ours does 
kauffman the owner of the kansas city royals baseball team and 
founder of marion laboratories now marion merrell dow has 
contributed more than 3 million to the 6yearold program 
project star students taught awareness and resistance has 
reached about 300000 students in missouri and kansas since it 
began all 15 public school districts in the kansas city area and 
many private schools participate in the project said calvin 
cormack executive director it also is taught in indiana and most 
of missouri and kansas 
star recently received national recognition after a fiveyear 
study by the midwestern drug abuse prevention research project 
showed that students who went through the program were significantly 
less likely to use drugs or to drink than other students 
kauffman says young people do drugs because of peer pressure 
if you belong to a group of four or five girls and they want 
another one to smoke marijuana she wants to remain in the group and 
keep her friends he said and just saying no wont get the 
job done because they ask you again and again 
so we teach a dozen different ways to say no like im 
afraid to smoke because my father will whip me until i tell him and 
then hell call your father he said 
katie aholt 13 went through star at pleasant lea jr high 
school in lees summit and said she learned a lot about saying no 
i really didnt know before how to say it without hurting my 
friends feelings but now i can do it and still keep my friends 
she said 
talking to her parents is easier now too 
now if one of my friends approached me with drugs i could 
just sit down and talk to my parents she said and before i 
really didnt know how serious it can be to your body and how it 
can change you 
charles r schuster director of the national institute on drug 
abuse which paid for the evaluation of project star praised the 
program for getting schools parents the media and community groups 
to work together in changing the social norms for drug use and 
providing a healthy drugfree environment for all people 
the study concluded that 142 percent of project star alumni now 
juniors or seniors in high school smoked marijuana in the month 
before they were surveyed compared with 202 percent who did not go 
through star for alcohol 36 percent of project star high schoolers 
drank alcohol in the preceding month compared with 50 percent of 
those not in program 
classroom lessons begin in the seventh grade which cormack 
called a critical time 
onset patterns show most kids get involved in drugs between 
the ages of 10 and 15 so those are critical decision years he 
said 
katie said kids like the program because it makes talk about 
drugs and alcohol realistic scare stories dont work in her view 
i think kids get into it because there are activities and 
roleplaying and stuff its more real she said 
former first lady nancy reagan saw star in action in 1986 during 
a visit to martin luther king jr middle school in kansas city 
students put on a skit showing how to refuse drugs while mrs 
reagan watched and then asked a few questions 
she seemed surprised when she asked students at the innercity 
school if they had used drugs and no hands went up the response 
did not surprise robbie alexander who teaches at king and trains 
other teachers in star curriculum 
the kids really wanted to refuse but they didnt know how this 
teaches kids to refuse in a friendly assertive manner without 
hurting their feelings she said and we arent telling them not 
to do drugs we let them make a decision 
tactics made famous by programs such as scared straight are 
ignored instead students make lists of the consequences good and 
bad of using drugs or alcohol 
we use their minds instead she said if you bring in an 
exconvict who tells them what she went through the kids say well 
she looks all right now she came through it so could i 
parents get involved by helping with homework assignments which 
gives them an opening to discuss a tough subject 
i have highly educated men and women telling me that through 
project star this is the first time they can talk to their kids 
about alcohol and drugs kauffman said

authorities closed the border between the central 
asian republics of kirghizia and uzbekistan to prevent the spread of 
ethnic violence that has killed more than 100 people it was 
reported saturday 
the soviet defense ministry has sent thousands of troops to the 
region but the situation in uzbekistan and kirghizia remained 
volatile tass said in a dispatch from the kirghizian capital of 
frunze 
clashes between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks both sunni moslems 
began june 2 at issue is the allocation of plots of land for 
housing in the densely populated povertystricken region 
the unrest was the latest in a series of ethnic troubles 
confronting soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose reforms 
have allowed many soviet minorities to express pentup grievances 
kirghizias leaders declared monday an official day of mourning 
for those killed in the unrest the government daily izvestia

prime minister benazir bhutto said 
saturday the threat of war with india still exists but that recent 
dialogue raises hopes the nations differences can be resolved 
peacefully 
the two are at odds over kashmir a former princely state claimed 
by both countries hindu india and moslem pakistan have fought three 
wars two of them over kashmir 
one cannot say the threat of war has faded away ms bhutto 
said in an interview with the associated press but it is good 
that the two sides after a long gap are beginning no matter how 
tentatively to talk to each other 
both countries recently massed troops near the border and indian 
prime minister vp singh told his countrymen to be 
psychologically prepared for another war 
tensions were eased slightly last month when india made an 
overture pakistan in turn proposed an urgent meeting between the 
two countries foreign secretaries to discuss matters including 
kashmir india says it is considering the suggestion 
we are keen to see that pakistan and india resolve their 
problems and outstanding disputes including kashmir and we do view 
with cautious optimism the forthcoming talks at the foreign 
secretaries level ms bhutto said 
shortly after the prime minister came to power in december 1988 
india and pakistan began talks aimed at normalizing relations that 
process was suspended during the 1989 indian elections which led to 
a change of government 
india and pakistan have been uneasy neighbors since they were 
created by the 1947 partition that ended british colonial rule of 
the subcontinent they routinely accuse each of inciting ethnic and 
religious violence in each others territory 
new delhi accuses pakistan of arming and training secessionists 
in the border states of punjab and jammukashmir indias only 
moslem state 
islamabad denies the allegations and accuses india of stirring 
trouble in the southern border province of sindh where ethnic 
bloodshed and ganglandstyle warfare have left more than 400 people 
dead in the past month 
the violence which has faded and flared for more than a decade 
is blamed on native sindhis and mohajirs or moslem indians who 
immigrated to pakistan following the partition and now dominate 
sindhs two largest cities karachi and hyderabad 
late last month ms bhutto was forced to call out the army to 
help restore law and order a move that has heightened fears that 
pakistan may soon return to military rule for the third time in its 
43year history 
ms bhutto said pakistans constitution allows the military to be 
called in to help the civilian government keep law and order 
the military is called time and again to aid the civil 
government this is their constitutional duty and this is their 
obligation to the elected government she said

a faulty toyota pickup design was cited 
as a jury awarded 527 million to a woman for injuries they 
suffered in a 1984 accident 
the superior court jury also awarded 100000 to the two 
daughters of cynthia gosper 35 of garden grove who was left a 
quadriplegic from the accident during a family vacation in arizona 
the daughters suffered minor injuries in the same accident 
attorneys for toyota motor sales usa inc of torrance said 
they will appeal fridays decision 
jurors found that a design flaw in the 1981 4wheeldrive sr5 
pickup gosper was driving allowed it to roll off a highway after it 
was struck from behind the drivers side door popped open throwing 
gosper from the truck 
officials with toyota motor sales said the award was one of the 
largest ever imposed against the company 
toyota attorneys insisted at trial that the trucks design is 
safe and that the force of the collision caused it to roll over 
an analyst with the center for auto safety a washingtonbased 
group founded by consumer advocate ralph nader praised the decision 
i think the jury was correct in their decision that the vehicle 
was designed in an unstable manner said analyst sam cole

legal debates over a doctor helping an alzheimers 
sufferer commit suicide with his machine are missing the point say 
religious leaders who believe such moral issues fall outside the 
realm of courts 
suicide is a word for selfmurder and some 5000 years of 
judeochristian morality has always defined it as wrong said jay 
berman spokesman for the roman catholic archdiocese of detroit 
and to aid in that would be equally morally wrong 
the debate over euthanasia is cast today solely in terms of 
legal and illegal he said the debate should actually address 
what is morally right and morally wrong 
the debate was renewed by the death of janet adkins 54 of 
portland ore on monday she rode with dr jack kevorkian and two 
of his sisters in his rusty volkswagen van to a park north of 
detroit there she pushed the button on a device that pumped lethal 
chemicals into her veins death came within five or six minutes 
kevorkian said 
adkins told kevorkian she had been diagnosed with incurable 
alzheimers disease and sought help from the retired pathologist in 
committing suicide 
oakland county circuit judge alice gilbert ordered kevorkian on 
friday to not use his device until prosecutors determine whether it 
is legal michigan courts have differed in interpreting michigan law 
in such cases 
but laws arent the question berman said friday 
deeming something legal doesnt make it automatically right he 
argued its legal to drive a car up to a 010 bloodalcohol 
level but its not right 
adkins and her husband ronald discussed her death wish with 
their minister alan g deale of the first unitarian church in 
portland where a memorial service for adkins was scheduled for 
sunday afternoon 
deale said his denomination supports the right to 
selfdetermination for those who become terminally ill 
adkins was in the early stages of alzheimers a degenerative 
brain and nerve disorder that robs people of their memories ability 
to function and eventually their lives an estimated 4 million us 
adults mostly over age 65 have the disease 
her husband said she despaired as her memory failed 
we support the whole idea that the dignity of life must be 
maintained deale said but we support the freedom of choice 
life only has dignity if it has some quality 
muhammed karoub of the detroitbased federation of islamic 
associations disagreed kevorkian and adkins he said interfered 
in a normal process that might better be left to god and the medical 
profession 
in the islamic religion god works through his learned people 
including doctors sometimes doctors have to temper their 
feelings they have to be careful almost an arrogance creeps in 
when dealing with life and death karoub said 
the eastern orthodox church considers euthanasia unacceptable 
under any circumstances said the rev demetrios kavadas pastor of 
assumption greek orthodox church in suburban st clair shores 
no one apart from god who gives life and death has the right 
to take the life of another he said 
sister elizabeth mcmillan of the st louisbased catholic health 
association said she considered kevorkians actions immoral and 
unethical 
what concerns me about the involvement of a physician in the 
taking of a life is that it undermines in a radical and important 
way the trust that has to be there between patient and physician and 
community and physician mcmillan said 
doctors are supposed to be healers 
president william f schultz of the bostonbased unitarian 
universalist association said such criticism is hypocritical and 
absurd 
doctorassisted suicide is humane its far more humane than 
allowing individuals to botch the job in a suicide attempt which 
creates far more suffering for the self and loved ones so im 
supportive of doctorassisted suicide he said 
kevorkian is scornful of religion and its influence over the 
medical profession which largely has condemned his views on 
euthanasia 
religious dogma has become part of the marrow of humanity we 
cant get rid of it he said during a march interview there 
should be absolutely no connection between medicine and religion 
but there is and its paralyzing 
berman said kevorkian and other advocates have wrongly presented 
euthanasia as compassionate 
i personally have in vietnam heard wounded soldiers cry out 
kill me kill me all our moral intonation is to help them recover 
and failing that to alleviate their suffering but we can never 
kill them

newly elected opposition lawmakers on 
saturday praised british prime minister margaret thatcher for her 
anticommunist ideology at an impromptu meeting of ukraines 
communistdominated parliament 
the conservative party prime minister standing beneath a giant 
statue of lenin engaged in lively exchanges about democracy with 
deputies assembled at the supreme soviet of the ukraine 
but seated beside the parliaments communist president 
volodymyr ivashko mrs thatcher backed down when opposition members 
urged her to recognize soviet lithuania and to declare support for 
separatists in the ukraine 
i can see you are trying to get me involved in your politics 
she said 
mrs thatcher addressed the ukraines parliament on the third day 
of her fourday visit to the soviet union she arrived here after 
conferring with president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow on friday 
the visit is aimed partly at showing solidarity with gorbachev 
beset by acute economic problems and secessionist moves as he 
battles to implement his reform policies 
lithuania estonia and latvia have taken steps toward seceding 
from the soviet union while separatists in some of the other soviet 
republics have indicated they would like to follow suit 
several hundred separatists demonstrated outside the kiev 
parliament holding placards denouncing imperialist moscow 
the lawmakers twothirds of whom belong to the communist party 
which won handsomely in the republics first free elections this 
year gave mrs thatcher a standing ovation after her address 
questions began with a bland inquiry about policy making in 
britain but quickly became controversial when members of four 
noncommunist parties that have formed an opposition grouping took 
the floor 
opposition member genrikh altunyan said he was one of 10 former 
political prisoners in the new parliament 
we know it is due to you and to president reagan that we have 
been able to be here today said altunyan we are very thankful 
to you and will never forget your support when we languished in 
labor camps 
there was scattered applause but most lawmakers stared ahead in 
silence 
altunyan an armenian spent 9 years in prison or labor camps 
from 1969 to 1987 for antisoviet activities 
mrs thatcher thanked him but said it is necessary for 
democracy to be underpinned by the rule of law rights clearly 
stated infringements also clearly stated 
another opposition member igor juchnovksy told mrs thatcher he 
was disappointed that britain did not recognize lithuania as a 
sovereign state he also said that britain should open an embassy in 
the ukraine 
mrs thatcher replied saying that britain did not for example 
have an embassy in california or in the canadian province of quebec 
in her address mrs thatcher stressed a central theme of her 
visit admiration for the soviet union in its daunting task of 
reform 
you are bringing about in the soviet union changes of a 
magnitude which have never been attempted before in history she 
said we wish you well 
in moscow earlier mrs thatcher assured six jewish refuseniks 
citizens who have been refused permission to emigrate that britain 
will continue campaigning for emigration rights but she reaffirmed 
her opposition to israel settling emigrants in the occupied 
territories 
on friday during a news conference with gorbachev mrs thatcher 
said israel was almost letting down those of us who have 
campaigned vigorously for jewish emigration 
gorbachev reiterated warnings that he may curb jewish emigration 
at a record high under his liberalized policies unless israel stops 
emigrants from settling in the west bank and gaza strip 
israel says that about 35000 soviet jews have arrived this year 
but it says it has no policy of settling them in territories seized 
in the 1967 middle east war and that only a few hundred have 
settled there so far 
several thousand people pressed against police barriers and 
cheered as mrs thatcher arrived in kiev saturday to tour a british 
trade and cultural exhibition she was greeted by a british military 
band playing scotland the brave 
she later took a brief walk through the center of kiev and 
visited the citys towering babi yar monument it stands at a gully 
in a park where 100000 jews and other ukrainians were slaughtered 
during the nazi occupation in world war ii 
on sunday mrs thatcher travels to a region of armenia that was 
devastated by an earthquake 18 months ago

a jailed animal rights activist may not 
have a visit from her dogs while she awaits sentencing on an 
attempted murder conviction a judge ruled 
us district judge peter c dorsey ruled friday that state 
correction officials are not obligated to allow fran stephanie 
trutts four dogs to visit her at the niantic prison for women 
trutts lawyer john williams said he will press on with efforts 
to allow visits with her dogs after trutt is sentenced 
its easy to make a joke about this williams said but the 
truth of the matter is her dogs are her only friends 
under a plea agreement trutt is expected to be sentenced in july 
to a term that would end march 31 1991 
an exception in the plaintiffs situation will provide a basis 
for similar requests by others and for all sorts of animals 
dorsey said 
trutt 34 pleaded no contest in april to a charge that she 
planted a bomb in the parking lot of us surgical corp in an 
attempt to kill the companys chairman leon hirsch 
the company uses laboratory dogs in showing surgeons how to use 
its patented surgical staplers which can be used in place of 
sutures

thousands of local and foreign observers 
will look on when bulgarians cast ballots sunday in the countrys 
first free elections in 58 years 
the parliamentary vote pits the leadership of the old communist 
party now renamed the socialist party against an opposition 
coalition called the union of democratic forces which wants a swift 
move to a westernstyle market economy 
the government on saturday night announced a ban on all exit 
polls and the circulation of any information about the election 
results before the official announcement by the central electoral 
commission the state news agency bta reported 
the commission acting on a protest from the main opposition 
alliance on thursday banned an exit poll to be conducted by the 
west german infas institute with bulgarian partners 
the race includes the socialists and 36 other parties vying for 
the 400 seats in the grand national assembly only one other party 
the bulgarian agrarian party is expected to win a significant 
number of votes 
almost 65 million of the nearly 9 million bulgarians are 
eligible to vote in the first multiparty elections since 1932 
official preelection surveys have given the ruling socialists 
heirs to four decades of totalitarian rule a commanding lead of 
between 42 percent and 49 percent of the vote 
the same polls have shown the union of democratic forces a 
distant second with 21 percent to 28 percent of the vote and the 
mainstream agrarian party third with 10 percent to 15 percent 
in a recent interview union chairman zhelyu zhelev rejected the 
official forecasts as manipulations and said his coalition hoped 
for at least 50 percent of the vote 
diplomats and some bulgarian observers predicted a fairly close 
race between the socialists and the union 
the polls open at 7 am and close at 6 pm with a possible 
onehour extension if people are still waiting in lines at 6 pm 
vote counting was to begin shortly after the polls closed but it 
was not clear when initial results would be released 
half the seats in parliament will be decided by direct vote and 
half by proportional representation parties must get a minimum of 4 
percent of the vote to win any seats in parliament 
a runoff election is scheduled on june 17 for races in which no 
candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote 
the campaign was marred by some violence and a lot of 
mudslinging largely between the governments newspaper duma and 
the opposition daily demokratsiya 
several deaths during the campaign are under investigation among 
them the slaying of a sympathizer of the union of democratic forces 
shot and killed by an army officer in northern shumen 
however leaders of the three leading parties refrained from 
personal attacks in a televised debate broadcast live friday night 
apparently hoping to avoid antagonizing voters 
zhelev socialist chief alexander lilov and agrarian leader 
viktor valkov agreed on the need for a coalition government to 
tackle the nations serious economic and political problems but 
zhelev insisted his alliance would not govern alongside the former 
communists 
many international organizations as well as individual countries 
have sent observers to watch the balloting 
on friday an americanled international observer group 
criticized flaws in the electoral process 
the group cited the exclusion of about 200000 ethnic turks who 
fled bulgaria last summer to escape religious and ethnic persecution 
under former communist leader todor zhivkov who was ousted in 
november 
the leader of a citizens group the association for free and 
fair elections said about 10000 members would monitor voting 
we have never had free and fair elections said kevork 
kevorkyan the groups leader this is the main reason why we 
undertake such an effort 
one does not get easily accustomed to freedom

prime minister jozsef antall said 
saturday that hungary intends to fully withdraw from the warsaw pact 
even if the alliance plans to dissolve eventually 
but he said hungary wanted to negotiate its pullout with the 
other six member nations rather than making a move on its own 
antall spoke to reporters saturday after returning from a warsaw 
pact meeting in moscow where he said he had conveyed the hungarian 
position to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
we made it clear that given the altered circumstances we 
consider the warsaw pact and in particular its military aspect 
outdated he said we also made it clear that we want to leave 
the military organization of the pact and the warsaw pact itself 
even if it is not dissolved 
asked about moscows response antall said the soviet leaders 
acknowledged our position 
at the summit the allies began planning the transformation from 
a military to a political body in the wake of the momentous changes 
in europe 
the warsaw pact in its present form plays a certain diplomatic 
and political role antall said but he said hungarian leaders 
believe the military aspect of the pact should be dissolved by the 
end of 1991 
moscow has agreed to remove all its troops stationed on hungarian 
territory by the middle of next year the hungarian leader said 
hungary wants to regain control of its own military as well 
we told moscow that we intend to restore full sovereignty over 
the hungarian armed forces revamp our forces into a defensive 
organization and will not participate in joint warsaw pact military 
exercises antall said 
antall said hungary would take her armed forces from under 
warsaw pact command even while we are still a member 
in an interview published saturday in the west berlin newspaper 
morgenpost east germanys defense minister rainer eppelmann 
predicted the breakup of the warsaw pacts military structures this 
year 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowieczki who is currently 
visiting budapest and joined antall at the news conference declined 
to comment directly on the hungarian position 
however he said work on establishing a collective european 
security system as favored by the warsaw pact members must begin 
without delay 
antall said hungary was mindful of regional effects of its 
actions 
we do not want to make a move that would disturb the german 
reunification process nor one that could possibly upset the

a soviet runaway said saturday he 
hijacked an aeroflot airliner to sweden because he was upset about a 
quarrel with his father over a broken moped no one was hurt 
the plane carrying a crew of seven and 114 passengers was on a 
domestic flight from the byelorussian capital of minsk to the soviet 
arctic port of murmansk when the youth threatened the crew with a 
fake grenade authorities said 
the incident ended peacefully when dimitry semionov 17 
surrendered to police an hour after the tupolev 154 jetliner landed 
at stockholms international airport 
he just said he wanted to stay in sweden said police 
inspector barry ivarsson 
none of the passengers knew the plane had been hijacked until it 
landed early saturday at arlanda airport 25 miles north of 
stockholm one said 
everything was peaceful and quiet passenger marya yeryomenko 
told a television interviewer before the flight returned to the 
soviet union the stewardess only told us after we had landed that 
we were in stockholm 
semionov a high school student from minsk said his father had 
told him to get out of the house after their quarrel 
my parents drove me away my father did i didnt have anywhere 
to stay he said in a radio interview speaking through an 
interpreter i didnt wish to harm anyone but i saw no other 
method everything got worse and worse and i was very 
disappointed 
the plane was searched for explosives before it returned to the 
soviet union saturday morning with its passengers 
semionovs lawyer birger ohlson said his client was in 
stockholms kronoberg prison and would be arraigned sunday 
he had quarreled with his father about something as trivial as 
a broken moped ohlson said in a television interview his 
father reprimanded him for not having mended it properly so the boy 
got angry and sold the moped his father wanted the money and when 
he didnt get it he took the keys and drove him out 
the lawyer said semionov told him he had not planned the hijack 
but got the idea on the plane 
semionov faced up to four years in a prison in sweden but would 
be subject to much harsher punishment in the soviet union the 
lawyer said 
according to what has been said he could face very grave 
consequences even the death penalty ohlson said 
ohlson said soviet authorities had not requested the youths 
extradition semionov was expected to seek asylum 
it may sound unpatriotic but i know that the society here is 
freer and the change in our country is too slow the teenager 
said in the radio interview 
after the plane was commandeered finnish authorities initially 
refused it permission to fly through their airspace but then 
relented 
alexander krasilnikov a spokesman for the soviet ministry of 
civil aviation in moscow confirmed that the plane had returned 
safely and there were no injuries among the passengers and crew

one of two brothers charged with 
killing their wealthy parents apparently tried to escape officials 
said after finding his leg chain was nearly severed 
a los angeles county sheriffs deputy noticed the link on lyle 
menendezs leg chain was nearly cut through while he was unlocking 
the defendants manacles for fridays court appearance said 
sheriffs sgt robert stoneman it was cut to the point where just 
slight pressure or twisting would have broken the link stoneman 
said 
we subsequently found in a search of their jail cells 
handwritten documents that we seized that may be of evidentiary 
value concerning this escape attempt stoneman added he refused 
to elaborate 
no charges were immediately filed

psychotherapists privilege with his patients could not be 
adequately divulged without disclosing the material claimed to be 
privileged

president fw de klerk freed 
48 political prisoners saturday in his latest effort aimed at 
improving the climate for blackwhite political negotiations 
in an announcement thursday de klerk had promised the releases 
and lifted the 4yearold national state of emergency in three of 
four provinces 
the african national congress the countrys leading opposition 
group welcomed the move but said more than 3000 activists remain 
imprisoned for politically motivated acts 
we are happy to be released said jeffrey radebe but our 
happiness is not complete today when we think of all the comrades we 
left behind 
radebe like most of the activists released saturday belongs to 
the anc several were convicted in some of the countrys most highly 
publicized terrorism and treason trials in recent years 
maj dave smith a spokesmen for the prisons service said 28 
inmates were released from the robben island prison off cape town 
and 20 more were freed from other prisons 
one of the men released stephen nkosi said he thought the 48 
were freed as a publicity move to undercut the current 
international tour by african national congress leader nelson 
mandela 
mandela is on a sixweek tour of europe north america and africa 
to urge foreign governments to maintain economic sanctions against 
south africa to protest apartheid 
speaking in geneva saturday mandela said nonwhites in south 
africa face the same discrimination as when he was imprisoned 27 
years ago he urged the international community to continue its 
pressure against apartheid 
the fact that he de klerk has declared he wants a nonracial 
constitution does not mean apartheid has come to an end said 
mandela who was freed from prison in february 
in brussels the european community welcomed the lifting of 
emergency rules but did it not mention whether the 12member 
trading bloc would lift its sanctions against pretoria 
the ec in 1986 banned imports of iron steel and gold coins from 
south africa and prohibited new ec investments in that country 
britain unilaterally lifted the investment ban after mandelas 
release 
nkosi had been sentenced to 16 years in 1977 for what he 
described as ancrelated activities he was among 28 men freed 
from robben island where many prisoners went on a hunger strike 
earlier this year demanding their release 
ashraf karriem convicted in 1988 along with several others at a 
terrorism trial hugged his ailing father at a tearful reunion in 
cape town 
ive been praying for this day i can die now said the 
father abdulrahman karriem 63 
the anc the countrys most powerful opposition group has set 
lifting the state of emergency releasing political prisoners and 
allowing the return of exiles were preconditions for blackwhite 
negotiations on ending apartheid 
de klerk says he wants to work out a new constitution with the 
opposition that will allow the countrys 5 million whites to share 
power with the 28 million blacks who currently have no voice in 
national affairs 
midlevel officials from the anc and the government worked 
together last month to put together a report on several issues 
dividing the two sides including the definition of a political 
prisoner 
also on thursday de klerk said he would work toward allowing 
thousands of exiles to return mandela says 20000 people currently 
live in exile 
in geneva the un high commissioner for refugees thorvald 
stoltenberg said saturday his agency would be ready to help 
repatriate political exiles once the anc and the south african 
government reach agreement on their return 
meanwhile a un envoy heading a factfinding mission to south 
africa to determine the progress of reforms rejected a charge 
saturday that he was interfering in the countrys affairs 
the question of apartheid is an international issue the 
question of negotiations is very much a national issue un 
undersecretary abdul rahim fahran said saturday his sixmember 
team will spend 11 days in south africa 
foreign minister pik botha warned the united nations this week 
not to interfere in south africas affairs the warning reportedly 
came in a letter to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar

2 years of revolt against israel saturday with a general strike 
and arab reports said two palestinians suspected of collaborating 
with israel were slain 
the new hardline cabinet of prime minister yitzhak shamir faces 
confirmation in parliament on monday but israel radio reported that 
women in shamirs rightwing likud bloc threatened to disrupt a 
likud meeting to approve the cabinet lineup sunday 
in an interview broadcast on israel radio saturday shamir said 
he will seek contacts with the united states with more vigor 
relations with washington have worsened recently while shamirs 
interim government continued to reject a us peace initiative and 
settle soviet jews in the occupied territories 
palestinians throughout the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
observed a general strike called by the proplo underground leaders 
to mark the monthly anniversary for the uprising a leaflet 
distributed in the territories said 
across the occupied lands merchants closed their shops public 
transportation was halted and children stayed home from school 
in the gaza strip town of rafah arab reporters said three masked 
men stabbed jemal abu aziz 29 with daggers and shot him to death 
near the el faruk mosque 
residents said aziz was known to work with israeli security 
forces and that his body was taken away by the authorities arab 
reporters said 
the army said it was a criminal matter and under police 
investigaton 
in jerusalem police said they found the body of another 
palestinian man stabbed overnight arab reporters identified the 
victim as hamad hamdan and said he had been accused of organizing 
the sale of arab lands to jewish settlers 
their deaths brought to 221 the number of palestinians slain by 
fellow arabs since the uprising began in december 1987 most were 
killed on suspicion of collaborating with israel or drug dealing or 
prostitution 
a total of 716 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops 
and civilians and 45 israelis have died in the violence 
shamir faced a new threat when women members of the governing 
likud central committee said they would distrupt sundays meeting 
scheduled to confirm shamirs new cabinet israel radio said 
it said 400 women planned to protest unless at least one female 
minister was appointed to the cabinet ultraorthodox religious 
parties have opposed serving on a cabinet with women 
shamir said on israel radio that he hoped his new government 
would work with a united spirit without too many differences among 
its members 
he said it was too early to consider a trip to washington since 
his government had not been approved by the knesset or parliament 
but he said he would pursue greater contact with the americans 
israel television said contacts with the us administration had 
practically been cut off since the national unity government 
which included the centerleft labor party led by shimon peres fell 
apart on march 15 
shamir lost a vote of confidence then when likud rejected 
leftofcenter labors demand to accept a proposal by secretary of 
state james a baker iii for preliminary peace talks with 
palestinians 
according to its guidelines shamirs new government promises to 
maintain its may 1989 peace initiative promising palestinian 
elections 
at the same time the new government has pledged to expand 
settlements in the occupied lands and use harsh measures against the 
palestinian revolt 
with his delicate twoseat majority in the 120member 
parliament shamir also faces the possiblilty of collapse should his 
rightwing partners reject his peace moves some of the partners 
oppose autonomy for the palestinians in the occupied territories

turn im in danger and everyone i associate with is in danger 
the leave she took from her job at the veterans administration

still will be open if and when police recapture her former husband 
and she can come out of hiding 
ms pearson requested 24hour police protection but benton 
county sheriff andrew lee said he could not oblige because of a 
shortage of money and manpower 
pearson gained early release from the state department of 
correction on dec 15 under the states emergency powers act which 
authorizes prison officials to hasten the parole of some eligible 
prisoners to ease overcrowding 
he had been sentenced to prison for a previous threat against ms 
pearson and was denied parole on july 1989

jan 6 
my life has been a living hell for the last three years it 
hasnt changed now so whats going to hurt ms pearson said

russian federation president boris n yeltsin on 
saturday promised to improve the economy in the soviet unions 
largest republic within three years but warned the situation was so 
tense that any spark could create a fire 
the unsual 20minute interview with the newly elected head of the 
russian republic was broadcast on state tv the same day it was 
announced that several yeltsin allies lost firstround elections to 
russias new legislature 
the silverhaired yeltsin 59 put aside his criticism of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and instead appealed for 
consolidation 
referring to the sagging economy yeltsin said we will find a 
way out of the situation but his offered few details of his plan 
he appealed specifically to coal miners who this summer will 
mark the first anniversary of a strike that damaged the economy and 
depleted the nations coal supplies some miners want to renew the 
walkout and a decision could come at a miners conference this week 
in the ukraine 
i would like somehow to calm miners who will soon mark the 
anniversary of their strike to ask them to refrain from 
destabilizing further the situation in the russian federation 
yeltsin said 
he said the situation is heated so much that any spark any 
irresponsible action or even a word could create a fire 
the soviet union is plagued by ethnic strife among many of its 
more than 100 nationalities chronic shortages of consumer goods and 
food rampant crime and poverty 
yeltsin has appeared almost nightly on tv for the past few weeks 
in broadcasts of proceedings from the congress of peoples deputies 
of the russian federation but saturdays interview was the first 
time he was allowed a special broadcast to espouse his views 
yeltsin was elected president of the russian federation which 
comprises twothirds of the countrys territory and just over half 
its population last month 
at his urging the russian congress on friday passed a 
declaration of sovereignty it proclaims that russian laws take 
precedence over national legislation 
in saturdays interview yeltsin promised his economic reform 
program would help our people to live better without giving 
details he said the program will hurt people less than the central 
governments plan to raise prices starting july 1 in its transition 
to a regulated market economy 
turning from the interviewer seated across a glasstopped table 
to look directly into the camera he added we need some credit of 
faith dear comrades from you for two years maybe a little more 
two or three years maximum to stabilize the situation and improve 
generally the situation in the russsian federation 
and reassuring skeptics he added such a program exists its 
not just words 
yeltsin in the television interview recorded thursday said his 
reformist forces have only a shaky majority and said he might have 
to turn directly to the people if parliament failed to adopt his 
radical measures 
if there is a critical point of a lack of understanding i will 
appeal to the people yeltsin said

balls of flame spewed saturday from the 
aft section of the burning supertanker mega borg sending huge 
columns of black smoke high over the gulf of mexico 
the smoke was visible for some 40 miles leaving a cloud 
thousands of feet in the mostly sunny sky 
from a helicopter above the scene heat from the blaze was 
intense and could be felt several hundred feet above the burning 
ship the air smelled of burning fuel 
three streams of water from a pair of fireboats appeared to have 
little effect on the inferno two coast guard cutters cruised 
nearby a motorized rubber boat patrolled near the bow of the 
burning ship 
two crewmen were confirmed dead in the 1 am explosion and 
authorities said two others were missing and presumed dead of the 
crew of 41 18 crew members were injured none seriously officials 
said 
the coast guard said the 853foot mega borg was hauling about 38 
million gallons of light crude oil when the blast occurred 57 miles 
southeast of galveston 
the fire continued to rage out of control saturday afternoon as 
two fireboats sprayed jets of water on the flames 
fire poured from the tankers stack and engulfed the aft section 
including the wheelhouse accounting for about the back fifth of the 
ship 
sections of the crew quarters that werent in flames were charred 
black blackened sections extended far up the walls and nearly to a 
radar antenna 
one fireboat the carolyn chouest was a few yards off the stern 
of the mega borg shooting two streams one directly down the stack 
and another in the flaming quarters on the starboard aft 
a second smaller fireboat was moored to the burning ship and 
played a single stream into the flames 
there was no sign of activity aboard the ship which did not 
appear to be listing the rear section appeared somewhat lower in 
the water than the rest of the marooncolored vessel 
there also was no evidence in the water around the ship that it 
was leaking cargo 
a small black oil slick could be seen to the left of the bow 
continuing about onethird of the way along the water line it did 
not appear to be growing 
the remains of a flag now ragged and charred black blew in the 
wind off a mast on the stern of the ship

the countrys first free election 
in 44 years should have been a joyous celebration of democracy but 
it has been marred by the legacy of its communist past 
the charges and countercharges over purported links between 
peoples party chairman josef bartoncik and the communists are the 
latest illustration of how the atmosphere of suspicion spawned by 
decades of authoritarian rule can poison the climate of emerging 
eastern european democraties 
in bartonciks case opponents have charged he collaborated for 
17 years with the communists dreaded stb secret police 
he has denied wrongdoing interior minister richard sacher also 
a member of the bartonciks noncommunist party asserted saturday 
that no evidence has been presented to back up the accusations 
thousands of files listing stb informants were destroyed in the 
aftermath of the peaceful november revolution that overturned 
communist domination bartonciks accusers say documents relating to 
bartoncik appear to have been among them 
but the staff of president vaclav havel asserts bartoncik did not 
deny his informer role when confronted by havel a former dissident 
who enjoys unrivaled popularity because of his courageous defiance 
of communist authorities 
other leading government personalities associated with havels 
civic forum political movement say bartoncik figures on a list of 
former stb informers 
civic forum which led the fight against communist rule with its 
sister party public against violence was founded by dissidents who 
suffered most under the autocratic marxists 
the postcommunist government has announced the dismantling of 
the secret police however fear and suspicion bred by decades of 
persecution contribute to the search for past culprits 
the increasingly acrimonious dispute pitting the two 
anticommunist parties could breed distrust for years to come 
i have great doubts about the future development in this 
country it reminds me too much of the past years said jiri 
cerny generalsecretary of bartonciks party 
in a protest to the national electoral commission peoples party 
leaders on saturday claimed the timing of accusations against 
bartoncik violated a rule prohibiting campaigning 48 hours before 
the voting which began friday and finished saturday 
they left open whether they would ask that the elections be 
invalidated a move that would further tarnish czechoslovakias 
democratic rebirth 
other east european nations have suffered similar problems as 
they emerged from totalitarianism 
in east germany wolfgang schnur a top conservative candidate 
admitted four days before free elections march 18 that he had at one 
time worked for the secret police he then resigned 
ibrahim boehme gave up his post as chairman of east germanys 
social democrats after unproven allegations he had also worked for 
the stasi secret police 
the democratic climate is perhaps most poisoned in romania whose 
swift and bloody december revolution left the securitate secret 
police formally in shambles but many of its personnel unscathed 
the communist party also collapsed but many of its former 
functionaries are members of the new government a protest of those 
communist links was in its 48th day saturday in downtown bucharest 
even in hungary where the ruling party voluntarily held 
multiparty elections and agreed to yield power the communist legacy 
has cast a long shadow 
the biggest scandal in the weeks before the march elections were 
revelations that surviving elements from the secret police were 
spying on anticommunist parties

president vaclav havel and the 
other dissidents who toppled the communists late last year appeared 
headed for a solid victory saturday in the nations first free 
elections in 44 years 
but a dispute over top politicians who allegedly worked for the 
communist secret police clouded the election euphoria 
havels aides at a nationally televised news conference accused 
a top christian democrat leader of working for the dreaded stb 
secret police for 17 years 
in a related development a havel ally and leader of the 
anticommunist revolution jan budaj announced at an emotional 
evening news conference that he had worked for the secret police and 
was quitting politics 
the national election was essentially a contest between two 
anticommunist alliances civic forum and its sister party public 
against violence and the christian democratic union 
projections released 4 hours after polls closed and based on 
initial vote counts suggested that havels civic forum and public 
against violence who together helped topple communist rule had won 
about 50 percent of the votes in the federal parliament 
the christian democrat union which may have been hurt by the 
charges about its leader had about 12 percent of the vote in both 
chambers running virtually neck and neck with the communists 
the peoples party led by the accused man josef bartoncik 
lodged a formal complaint that havels government violated election 
laws by denouncing bartoncik less than 48 hours before balloting 
started the peoples party is part of the christian democrat 
unions coalition 
international observers monitoring voting on friday and saturday 
did not say whether they believed the scandal violated election laws 
the czechoslovak commission overseeing the elections ruled that a 
violation had occurred but it was not clear what action would be 
taken 
bartoncik was expected to win a seat in the new federal 
parliament and the dispute over his background could become 
important if the election results in a coalition government 
in the slovak capital of bratislava budaj a leader of public 
against violence said he was pressured into signing a document in 
1979 to cooperate with the secret police after trying to defect and 
getting caught 
the election was for a 300seat bicameral federal parliament 
which will draft a new constitution removing the last vestiges of 
communist rule the lawmakers also are expected to reelect havel to 
a twoyear term 
czechoslovaks also voted during the twoday election for regional 
parliaments for the czech and slovak republics 
final results were not expected until sunday 
the parliament is made up of the house of the people whose 150 
members ran at large nationwide and the house of nations whose 150 
members represent either the czech or the slovak republics 
other smaller parties were trying to win the 5 percent minimum 
vote required to get seats under a system of proportional 
representation 
top aides to havel interrupted a nationally televised news 
conference for the first tv broadcast of the initial projections 
the aides beamed as the projections came through and havels 
spokesman michael zantovsky made a vsign to applauding czech 
supporters 
but the aides faced tough questions about their handling of the 
bartoncik affair 
allegations that bartoncik was a secret police agent first 
surfaced in may in the austrian weekly profil it said he worked 
under the code name hajek and registration number 15301 in the 
moravian capital brno where he was a top official of his party 
then allied with the communists 
bartoncik denied any collaboration with the hated stb or secret 
police his party colleague interior minister richard sacher 
earlier had come under fire for alleged reluctance to investigate 
secret police activities 
sachers deputy jan ruml a havel appointee and like the 
president a former dissident was then charged with investigating 
stb operations 
ruml told saturdays news conference that he had confirmed only 
on monday that bartonciks name was on a register of brno secret 
police agents 
for 17 years he was a paid adviser of the stb said havel 
aide jiri krizan 
prosecutor pavel rychetsky said a former stb agent had come 
forward independently to him on tuesday and told him that the 
information bartoncik gathered was passed directly to former party 
leader milos jakes 
bartoncik even infiltrated the dissident movement charter 77 
rychetsky said building contacts with vaclav benda now the leader 
of the czech christian democrats 
havel confronted bartoncik with the information on tuesday and 
bartoncik promised to quit politics said krizan who was present at 
the meeting 
bartoncik was hosptalized late tuesday with a reported heart 
attack but issued no statement that he was relinquishing his 
candidacy for parliament 
more than 100 people from all parties did step down after 
screening for links with the secret police who civic forum says had 
a network of 140000 informers 
later saturday havel broke away from the political disputes to 
appear as the nonmusical star of a concert to denounce racism 
the president who took the stage to welcome american singer paul 
simonwas himself greeted by wild cheers of long live havel 
from a crowd of about 10000 at the concert in pragues historic old 
town square 
havel said the concert is even more special because its taking 
place on the day when after long decades we could again choose our 
future

the presidential candidate voters choose sunday 
to lead peru through the next five years will inherit a violent 
bankrupt country many people believe is ungovernable 
whatever the campaign promises longbrewing crises will make it 
difficult just to maintain current levels of poverty and popular 
discontent 
on the eve of the election maoist shining path guerrillas called 
armed strikes in four important cities in the andean highlands 
and the eastern jungle region to block the voting the call issued 
in pamphlets crudely painted wall posters and messages to radio 
station carried with it the threat of violence against those 
disobeying the order to boycott the election 
those voting will decide between novelist mario vargas llosa a 
conservative champion of free markets and alberto fujimori the son 
of japanese immigrants who was an obscure agricultural engineer 
when the presidential campaign began 
fujimori 51 and vargas llosa 54 were in a dead heat in the 
runoff election according to independent polls released friday by 
law president alan garcia cant run for a consecutive fiveyear term 
its a fallacy to say this country is ungovernable fujimori 
an independent said in an interview the country is governable 
but the political parties have demonstrated theyre incapable of 
governing 
about 10 million of the 22 million peruvians are eligible to 
vote and are required by law to do so polls will be open from 8 
am to 3 pm if it is a close contest as expected the result may 
not be known for weeks because of poor communications with isolated 
mountain and jungle towns 
the runoff was required after no candidate received a majority in 
the first round of balloting april 8 
the winner is to take office july 28 among his problems will be 
annual inflation of 2000 percent the inti worth 7 cents when 
it was introduced in 1986 has shrunk to less than twothousandths 
of a penny wages have lost 50 percent of their purchasing power in 
the past two years 
two leftist insurgencies political violence takes nine lives a 
day and at least 18500 have been killed in the last decade the 
economic damage is more than 15 billion rebels control large parts 
of the interior and onethird of peru is under military control 
a foreign debt of 20 billion the highest per capita in south 
america international agencies stopped credit when peru ceased 
making payments on the debt in 1986 and several foreign banks are 
suing the treasury is more than 100 million in the red 
labor and public unrest street sweepers prison inmates even 
hospital patients hold strikes and protests for higher pay and 
better services four of five peruvians lack regular employment 
drug trafficking peru is the largest producer of coca leaf the 
raw material of cocaine and more than 200000 peruvians make their 
living from it the international crackdown on trafficking has cut 
into the 1 billion the country earns annually from the trade and 
the united states is pressing peru to accept military aid in 
fighting coca production 
destroyed or wornout public facilities major highways are 
crumbling for lack of maintenance crippling the transport of 
produce from farms in the interior guerrillas blow up bridges and 
power lines power and water rationing hamper industrial production 
natural disasters have done their share of damage 
an earthquake devastated towns in the northern jungle last month 
and a volcano in the southern andes is threatening to erupt 
scientists have detected the beginnings of an el nino phenomenon 
unusually warm ocean currents that disrupt weather patterns a 1982 
el nino ruined crops and nearly destroyed the important fishing 
industry 
a recent rand corp study financed partly by the us state 
department said a military takeover was imminent 
conditions will become much worse before they get better it 
said the real question is not whether there will be a coup but 
when 
the general belief in peru appears to be that a fujimori victory 
would be more likely to provoke a coup because of his economic 
plans critics say they differ little from the populist measures of 
president garcia 
among fujimoris stated goals are reducing annual inflation to 
less than 100 percent by the end of his first year he advocates 
maintaining controls on the economy which vargas llosa blames for 
perus economic decline and says he will replace the inti with a 
new currency 
fujimori proposes allowing prices for subsidized goods and 
services to reach market levels but then would freeze wages and 
prices for six months he also promises to reach agreement with 
foreign lenders on new credits 
he has rejected help from the us military with the antidrug 
campaign and proposes to wean farmers from coca by stimulating 
production of legal crops 
vargas llosas inflation goal is 10 percent within a year and he 
wants fundamental changes in the economy based on freemarket 
principles 
the novelist would reduce the huge bureaucracy by shifting 
tens of thousands of workers to the private sector he proposes 
lifting price controls selling state enterprises and changing labor 
laws to allow companies to fire unproductive workers

radical students and dissidents fought 
riot police saturday in street battles around seoul and the southern 
city of kwangju during demonstrations to demand broader democratic 
reform 
radical groups had called for nationwide protests against the 
government of president roh taewoo in seoul and 17 other cities 
this weekend to mark the anniversary of 1987 prodemocracy protests 
however that call went largely unheeded saturday radicals vowed 
to stage more protests in 18 cities sunday 
in 1987 the nationwide popular protests reached their peak on 
june 10 as tens of thousands of students and other south koreans 
rose up against the dictatorial president chun doohwan demanding 
democratic reform 
chun finally agreed to hold the countrys first direct 
presidential elections later that year roh won as the government 
candidate 
he has since introduced widespread democratic reform including 
greater press freedom but critics say he has not done enough rohs 
popularity has declined recently but most south koreans also shun 
the radicals because of their violent tactics 
on saturday about half the countrys 130000member national 
police force was mobilized to block protests officials said 
in seoul about 2000 students in groups ranging from 200 to 
500 clashed with police at at least five different places hurling 
rocks and firebombs police fired tear gas to break up the 
protesters 
punish roh taewoo demonstrators shouted charging that the 
generalturnedpresident was backtracking on his promise of reform 
disband the dlp protesters also chanted accusing rohs 
governing democratic liberal party of scheming to prolong what they 
called dictatorial power 
the party formed through a merger of rohs old governing party 
with two centrist opposition groups has become a main target of 
student protests students say the consolidated party will stifle 
democracy 
in southern seoul police fired tear gas to disperse about 200 
members of a leading dissident group the national democratic 
alliance who were trying to demonstrate near kuro industrial 
complex 
police arrested about 50 people including chang kipyo chief 
organizer of the alliance 
in the southern opposition stronghold of kwangju 150 miles south

a headon collision between a freight train 
and a large railmaintenance unit caused a spectacular fire more 
than 500000 in damage and the 12hour shutdown of an amtrak 
passenger route officials said 
braking problems on a rail grinder a heavy unit about two 
locomotives long that was being operated by a contractor apparently 
led to the accident friday evening howard kallio of burlington 
northern railroad said saturday 
all three locomotives and some of the approximately 35 cars on 
the freight train were destroyed kallio said he estimated damage 
at 530000 to the engines cars and tracks 
firefighters battled flames that sent up a column of smoke 
visible five miles four workers suffered minor injuries in the 
crash hospital officials said 
the eastbound freight train was traveling about 50 mph when the 
collision occurred while the rail grinder pulling 10 cars was 
westbound at about 20 mph kallio said 
they crashed when the rail grinder failed to stop before a point 
where two sets of track converge he said 
crew members were given urinalysis tests as required under 
federal law but it appears that the grinder must have lost some 
braking capacity he said 
kallio said he did not know the extent of damage to the rail 
grinder used once or twice a year on heavily traveled tracks to 
remove rough spots from the top and sides of the rails 
passengers from two trains one westbound and one eastbound 
were bused between wenatchee and spokane before the tracks were 
reopened between 6 am and 7 am saturday he said about 20 
residents were evacuated briefly from homes about a mile from the

leaders of the national rifle association 
assured members saturday that recent legislative setbacks and 
declining membership wont weaken their determination to protect gun 
owners interests 
they say we must compromise our opponents define compromise as 
we taketh you giveth this is not compromise my friends that is 
surrender nra first vice president richard d riley told the 
groups annual convention 
the remarks drew applause from more than 1000 members attending 
the second day of the threeday event at the anaheim convention 
center 
the convention comes at a crucial time in the nras history once 
considered politically invincible the gun lobby has recently lost 
legislative battles in new jersey maryland and california 
earlier this month the nra suffered one of its worst defeats 
when the us senate narrowly passed a ban on some assault rifles as 
part of an omnibus crime bill the nra rebounded by helping spark a 
filibuster on the bill but both democrats and republicans said a 
compromise is still possible 
the nra also has lost an estimated 250000 members over the last 
four years and some of those remaining have either grumbled that 
the group has failed to work hard enough or has lost touch with the 
rank and file overwhelmingly hunters and gun collectors 
but saturdays speeches signaled that the nra which still has 
28 million members will take a hard line rather than soften its 
position on handgun purchase waiting periods and assault rifle bans 
leaders called on members to stop bickering and mount a unified 
attack against what they described as misinformed media liberal 
police chiefs and overly soft nra members 
members agreed that the group must continue to fight they said 
they fear that todays legislation banning assault rifles could be 
tomorrows ban on the kinds of guns most nra members actually have 
its just a matter of time that the next gun theyll be after 
is the shotgun said william e smith of owensboro ky 
about 20000 members of the 119yearold organization and 
thousands of nonmembers came to the convention in addition to 
speeches and workshops there were vendors hawking everything from 
sunglasses to hunting rifles 
outgoing nra president joe foss acknowledged in a speech that 
recent months have been difficult but said the group is far from 
dead 
we havent lost everything he said what weve lost are 
some battles but well win the war before its all over with

mexico and el salvador signed economic and 
cultural agreements saturday in efforts to ease nearly 10 years of 
tension between the two governments over the salvadoran civil war 
the agreements restructure el salvadors 77 million debt with 
mexico and increase mexican oil shipments to the central american 
country by 50 percent 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani told a news conference 
that el salvador is behind in debt payments but gave few details on 
the restructuring program 
he did say however the negotiations involve more mexican 
investments in el salvador 
the increase in oil sales from 8000 to 12000 barrels a day 
comes under a 1981 pact under which mexico and venezuela sell oil to 
countries in the region at low interest with longterm credit 
other agreements that were signed saturday cover cooperation in 
education industrial development and radio and television 
relations between the two countries have been strained since 
1980 when mexico withdrew its ambassador to protest the killing of 
a mexican journalist in 1981 mexico and france signed a joint 
declaration recognizing the leftist rebels in el salvador as a 
political force 
mexico did not return its ambassador to san salvador until 1985 
the guerrillas continue to maintain a political office in mexico 
and their leaders hold frequent news conferences in mexico city 
at a news conference cristiani said he was optimistic that a 
peace agreement ending the 10yearold civil war in his country 
would be signed with the guerrillas by the end of this year 
we believe that before september a ceasefire can be signed and 
that in the following months a lasting peace can be signed with the 
integration of the fmln into the political life of the country as a 
political party and with full guarantees he said 
the fmln is the farabundo marti national liberation front the 
umbrella group for five guerrilla factions fighting to overthrow the 
usbacked government 
cristiani said the army could be reduced with the signing of a 
peace accord 
if that is achieved our army definitely will be able to be 
reduced considerably and the armed forces will be dedicated 
exclusively to safeguarding the integrity and sovereignty of el 
salvador he said 
he did not indicate how many of the nations 54000 government 
troops could be demobilized 
the government and guerrillas renewed talks in april agreeing on 
an agenda for negotiations 
more than 71000 people most of them civilians have been killed 
in the war between leftist guerrillas and a succession of 
usbacked governments

springfield fed pancakes to 33869 hungry residents outdoing 
battle creek by 1013 breakfasts

calling it a farewell to arms 
president violeta barrios de chamorro on saturday watched thousands 
of contras line up to turn in their guns in a symbolic last push to 
meet a deadline for demobilization 
nicaraguan officials said the contras might meet sundays 
deadline but international organizations said it was unlikely 
this emotional act puts an end to war in nicaragua mrs 
chamorro told rebels assembled in the grassy square of el almendro 
farewell to arms and war we are now going to live in 
brotherhood she spoke following a mass offered by roman catholic 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
but santiago murray a representative of the organization of 
american states mission that provides aid to demobilized rebels 
said the process will continue several days beyond the deadline 
about 2000 rebels were present at the weekend demobilization at 
el almendro 
rebels with the usbacked contras began disarming may 7 but 
the process was suspended twice some 7500 members of the 
12000member guerrilla force remained to be demobilized saturday 
murray said international organizations do not have the capacity 
to process more than 500 rebels a day and bad weather was slowing 
down the disarmament at almendro 
at least six rebel commanders handed over their combat rifles to 
mrs chamorro before a heavy thunderstorm sent people scattering for 
cover 
among the contra leaders disarming were jose benito bravo the 
contra chief of military intelligence 
he stood in line with two thousand other rebels waiting to be 
processed by un and oas officials as a first step before returning 
to civilian life 
top contra chief israel galeano also known as commander 
franklin told his assembled fighters that disarming is one of the 
concrete steps that are being taken toward democracy he said 
demobilized rebels would now join in the efforts toward 
reconstruction 
despite the rain un peacekeeping troops proceeded to destroy the 
guerrillas rifles using acetylene torches to cut through the metal 
the demobilization process also requires rebels to turn in their 
combat fatigues have their pictures taken and receive a medical 
examination

a ghost town high above the city 
disappeared saturday when fentier village an amusement park billed 
as where the old west comes east was disassembled and 
auctioned off 
carved into a mountaintop 1500 feet up the frontier town 
replica was conceived by ned fenton an insurance and real estate 
agent who realized his dream of building an amusement park near 
this far western new york state town fenton died of cancer six 
months ago 
fentier village opened in 1966 was a threetiered frontier 
town connected by cable car and steps made of railroad ties 
visitors also traveled through the park via stagecoach a 1mile 
train ride or on horseback 
along main street with its requisite barber shop bank and 
hotel good guys outdrew bad guys four times a day in staged 
shootouts that ended with stuntmen often fentons sons 
dying in dramatic falls from secondstory porches 
the park also featured silver dollar ballroom where such 
entertainers as hank williams jr and frank sinatra jr appeared 
and a cinema that showed silent films 
but three years later the park closed when the state condemned 
the parking lots and first tier at the base of the mountain to 
build a superhighway 
and the code of the west didnt mean fire and building codes 
the buildings maintained by fenton in hopes of reopening the park 
some day failed to meet safety standards they and their 
furnishings were sold 
saturdays auction drew about 500 people and raised at least 
70000

the seneca indians used as a burial ground 
fentons sons envision developing the scenic property into a 
yearround resort with skiing horseback riding restaurants and 
possibly a hotel 
some came to the auction to get a last look at a part of their 
past 
the reason we came up here today is we came up here when we 
were kids said carol waldrip of nearby olean its really kind

the fire continued to rage out of control late saturday night 
as two fireboats sprayed jets of water on the flames a coast guard 
cutter stood by and a third fireboat was en route 
the battle was expected to last all night more reinforcements 
hired by the vessels owner were expected to arrive sunday morning 
muller said 
therell be at least 10 vessels that will be going out to work 
on the salvage operation he said 
he said the cost of the firefighting effort was being covered by 
the owner 
the mega borg could break up and sink muller said but that was 
considered a remote possibility he said officials were unsure how 
much damage the fire was doing to the ship 
weve not seen any indication that the vessel will sink or 
break apart he added 
the first explosion occurred in the engine room while the 
15yearold tanker was transferring its shipment to the italian 
tanker framura 
the mega borg had transferred 70000 barrels of its 980000 
barrels of crude oil when the blast occurred coast guard capt tom 
greene said at a news conference in galveston 
we dont know what caused the spark or the fire or whatever 
but there were explosions and while our helicopters were on the 
scene they witnessed another explosion so its a pretty hot 
fire petty officer george wilson said earlier in houston 
two more explosions occurred shortly before 2 pm saturday 
said muller 
greene said about 7000 gallons of crude oil or ship fuel spread 
on the water creating an oil sheen about 11 miles long and a 
quartermile wide 
coast guard officials speculated that the fuel poured into the 
water from hoses used to transfer the oil to the italian tanker or 
that it poured out the top of the tanker as the fire heated up the 
oil and caused it to expand 
if all goes well i really dont expect much more pollution 
than is out there greene said 
we dont expect any of the oil to reach the texas coast 
said ensign larry meredith of the coast guards marine safety 
office in galveston it will mix with natural ocean water and 
if nature takes its course evaporate being 50 60 miles off the 
coast we just expect it to evaporate 
in addition the current was running parallel to the coast 
instead of towards it 
greene said the biggest fear was that the fire which apparently 
was being fed by burning engine oil or lubricating oil might 
spread to three cargo tanks near the engine room the three tanks 
hold 360000 barrels or roughly 15 million gallons of the light 
crude 
greene said even if oil spilled there would be no disaster like 
the 11 milliongallon exxon valdez spill in 1989 more than 1100 
miles of alaskan shoreline were soiled by the spill of heavy crude 
the mega borgs shipment is light crude which would disperse 
much more rapidly than heavy crude he said adding that the mega 
borg is much smaller than the exxon valdez 
following the blast the mega borgs captain and first mate 
escaped and were taken aboard the coast guard cutter cushing the 
other surviving crew members the captains wife and his two 
children were taken to freeport aboard the commercial vessel 
patricia m 
the 17 injured crew members were taken to brazosport memorial 
hospital in lake jackson where two were hospitalized the other 15 
were treated for smoke inhalation and released said nursing 
supervisor linda runnels 
the hospitalized crew members were in stable condition one 
underwent surgery for an injured tendon in his left arm and the 
other suffered a leg injury ms runnels said 
coast guard officials said they didnt know refinery or 
refineries the oil was destined for the houstongalveston area is 
home to several major refineries 
greene said the fire could burn out of control for two days and 
authorities prepared for a worstcase scenario putting together 
response teams consisting of environmental protection agency 
officials the coast guard atlantic strike team and other state and 
federal agencies 
as a precaution a highseas boom to contain oil was being 
brought in from mobile ala greene said 
officials also requested a plane with a special infrared 
detectors so authorities could track an oil spill at night 
the mega borg was coming from palanca angola its next port of 
call after galveston was scheduled to be aruba 
the tankers us agent is biehl and co of galveston a man 
answering the telephone there saturday said the company had no 
comment 
the tanker is operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund norway 
managing director geir larsen said his company owns a little less 
than 50 percent of the tanker through the ks mega borg investment 
group he said other owners are private investors whom he refused 
to identify 
larsen said he knew of no previous problems with the ship the 
crew was from the philippines and the officers are indian the 
captain is cm mahidhara larsen said

canadas leaders signed a tentative deal saturday 
night to rescue a flagging constitutional accord that would grant 
special status to frenchspeaking quebec 
newfoundlands premier clyde wells said he remained 
dissatisfied with the compromise but may submit it for a popular 
referendum in his province 
however wells signed the agreement with the nine other 
provincial premiers in a nationally televised public session 
saturday night 
this is a happy day for canada declared prime minister 
brian mulroney before signing the document 
the agreement was worked out in ottawa at the end of the seventh 
day of private talks aimed at persuading holdout provinces to 
approve the package 
even if ratified the constitutional amendment recognizing 
quebec as a distinct society clause would have no immediate 
practical effect however it would oblige the supreme court to 
consider the provinces distinctiveness when considering specific 
laws challenged under the constitution 
it is also a symbol of enormous significance to frenchspeaking 
quebecers 
it was a great exercise in nation building said ontario 
premier david peterson after the accord was achieved there was 
blood in the floor but it was common blood 
but wells declared i am not approving of this particular 
accord 
he said he may submit it to a popular or legislative referendum 
in his province before the june 23 ratification deadline 
new brunswick premier frank mckenna who had been another 
holdout until the latest talks called the compromise the best 
deal possible 
quebec premier robert bourassa initially boycotted the talks 
saturday after refusing to discuss any more changes in the clause 
that would recognize quebec as a distinct society however 
later in the day he returned to the talks 
the tentative agreement would leave the distinctsociety clause 
unaltered but ask constitutional experts to prepare a legal opinion 
on how it would affect the countrys rights charter 
bourassa said of the final compromise this is not affecting 
the integrity of the meech lake accord we are quite satisfied that 
our objectives are fulfilled 
in announcing the agreement peterson said it must still be 
approved by the legislatures of newfoundland and new brunswick as 
well as a third holdout manitoba 
mulroney convened the 10 provincial leaders for the private 
talks because they face a june 23 deadline for ratification of the 
amendment to the 1982 canadian constitution 
quebec refused to sign the constitution saying it did not take 
the provinces distinct french character into consideration in an 
effort to win quebecs support the amendment known as the meech 
lake accord contains the clause that designates quebec a 
distinct society 
the other points in meech lake include expanding the provinces 
powers to opt out of some federalprovincial spending programs and 
a new constitutional amending formula 
bourassa of quebec has made no direct threats regarding 
separatism if the accord is not approved but nationalism is on the 
rise in the province and there is a growing sentiment for either 
separation or some sort of independenceassociation arrangement 
with the rest of canada 
canada has 25 million residents but onefourth of them live in 
quebec 
in 1987 mulroney and the 10 premiers signed a fivepoint 
agreement for the meech lake constitutional amendment and set a 
threeyear deadline for ratification 
in the interim governments changed in newfoundland manitoba 
and new brunswick and the new premiers reneged on the signatures of 
their predecessors quebec had insisted the accord must be passed 
as is and that other concerns worrying some of the premiers such 
as senate reform can be discussed at a future constitutional 
conference

plans to raise a tugboat that sank in 
the st johns river were postponed saturday night but only after 
workers made sure no more diesel fuel was leaking from the 800ton 
vessel officials said 
the captain bill which spilled about 1000 gallons of diesel 
fuel when it sank friday in jacksonville was rescheduled for 
raising sunday with two cranes mounted on barges us coast guard 
lt lynn woods said 
coast guard officials and representatives of crowley towing and 
transportation co which contracted the 117foot tug said there 
was no reason to rush because the disabled tug is mired outside a 
main shipping channel and is no longer leaking fuel 
the decision was to proceed with caution do it right and 
safely since it was not impeding navigation and since the diesel 
fuel was not leaking any longer said lucille lane director of 
public relations for crowley the fuel is contained everything 
at this point is secure 
even so small quantities of engine oil from the vessel were 
still bubbling to the rivers surface saturday woods said 
the coast guard has classified the spill as minor but that 
could change if a significant amount of the 53000 gallons of 
diesel fuel remaining on board begins to leak woods said 
a fuel tank rupture during efforts to raise the vessel was not 
considered a major threat he said the spilled fuel was cleaned up 
using absorbent pads and a floating skimmer containment booms were 
placed around the boat 
plans call for pumping the remaining fuel from the tug after it 
is raised then towing the vessel to the nearby crowley dock or a 
dry dock so it can be examined to determine what caused it to sink 
woods said 
the captain bill had been en route to guantanamo bay cuba 
taking a 400foot barge loaded with sand to be used in 
construction when a device used to secure the barge to the tug 
broke woods said the tug was heading back to the crowley docks 
when it sank

longstanding records suggest clearly that sound 
investments in quality small stocks can produce much better returns 
than portfolios consisting only of largecompany stocks 
the very idea tends to challenge conventional thinking because 
you seldom hear about the little fellas but you cant escape hearing 
about the big boys who make up the popular stock market averages 
the big brokerage houses research and promote big stocks mutual 
funds and pension funds buy them business magazines interview 
bigcompany managers big company products are advertised wherever 
people can see or hear 
but the records show one area in which the little guys beat the 
big guys the little guys as a category often can produce bigger 
returns for investors than the big fellows and theyve been doing 
it for many years 
several research projects demonstrate this but probably the 
first of them was by rolf banz a doctoral student at the university 
of chicago in 1978 who examined all new york stock exchange stocks 
by size for every year in the period 193174 
he determined size by multiplying shares of each stock by share 
price he invested equal dollars in each company in the bottom 
20 percent ranked by market value each year he revised the list to 
include only the smallest 
banz found that in that period his hypothetical portfolio 
produced about a 5 percent better annual rate of return than the 
market as a whole others later found a similiar effect although 
not always by the same percentages 
five percent might not seem like much especially at a time when 
some folks arent happy if they realize that kind of gain in a 
month but time is the forgotten factor of investing and 5 percent 
over the years adds up beautifully 
gerald perritt investment adviser mathematician and author of a 
book on the smallfirm effect calculates that in the 60 years 
192685 the standard amp poors 500stock index had a compound annual 
return rate of 98 percent versus a 126 percent compound annual 
rate for the socalled small stocks 
he finds therefore that if an investor had been able to invest 
1000 in the sampp index at the end of 1926 that initial investment 
would have grown to 279100 by the end of 1985 
but the smallerstock portfolio would have grown to 1241200 
now a mystery albeit one with many clues in the past five years 
or so the smallstock effect seems to have disappeared perritt a 
former professor who liked the effect so much he founded a 
newsletter to trace it concedes it 
he doesnt concede much more however he is convinced it still 
exists he reexamines it from time to time in the newsletter 
investment horizons and recently he offered some reasons why small 
hasnt outperformed big 
first he says individual investors have been liquidating their 
direct common stock holdings in recent years while institutional 
investors have been net accumulators that helped push the bigs 
higher relative to small 
institutional investors generally concentrate their selections on 
the large stocks they almost have to because of their appetite for 
big blocks of shares while individuals traditionally have been 
buyers of smallcompany stocks 
additionally the stock market of the late 1980s was one of 
takeovers and mergers most of which were concentrated in large 
companies and as most investors know those takeovers pushed up 
prices spectacularly 
perritt based in chicago is biding his time still convinced 
that smaller stocks are the best bargains in the marketplace today 
the longterm effect will again show up he doesnt say when that 
might be 
just because a store puts merchandise on sale is no guarantee 
there will be a stampede of customers he says the same 
behavior exists in the stock market 
but he concludes when word of such bargains eventually 
spreads demand begins to heighten as do the prices of the 
merchandise

danny elfmans hopes for a music career seemed 
doomed from the start guitar piano and violin teachers offered him 
the same advice forget it 
danny a musical career is not what we recommend for you you 
like art can you paint can you draw why dont you try to find 
something else 
today the 37yearold elfman is among the most soughtafter film 
composers the latest of his 15 scores is for warren beattys dick 
tracy 
elfman almost giggles as he recalls those rejections from his 
youth i received nothing but discouragement i just had no 
apptitude as a musician those music teachers wherever they are 
ought to be ashamed of themselves elfman was no prodigy but the 
frenetic front man for the rock band oingo boingo is showing up his 
early critics 
more than an adequate guitar player elfman is in his 11th year 
of belting out songs of black humor about death and restless 
spirits back in 1979 the band thought it would only survive for 
six months 
oingo boingo a fixture on the los angeles club scene but a nogo 
on mainstream radio has a rabid following in of all places 
brazil among surfers and skateboarders 
you turn on brazilian radio you listen to any station for 45 
minutes and you hear a boingo song elfman says at first i was 
turned off because by our standards were not surf music thats 
the beach boys i just had to adjust my way of thinking if 
brazilian surfers want to listen to oingo boingo whos to tell them 
not to 
avantgarde movie director tim burton saw oingo boingo at a club 
in los angeles and recruited elfman to score peewees big 
adventure more burton works beetlejuice and last summers 
blockbuster batman followed later this year burton and 
elfmans teamwork on edward scissorhands will be in theaters 
its pretty much nonstop elfman said in a recent interview 
following a soldout oingo boingo concert at the royal oak music 
theater 
i am in a unique position that i never could have quite 
imagined myself in it kind of came out of the blue with peewees 
big adventure 
elfman was typecast as a composer for film comedies he took a 
few more then began to decline because he had the band to consider 
oingo boingo recently completed its first tour east of the rockies 
to promote its new album dark at the end of the tunnel on mca 
oingo boingo the name really doesnt mean anything elfman says 
still has its lead man but time is tight when you juggle careers 
as disparate as rock music and film composing 
i dont think the same when im doing one or the other im 
very disciplined as a film composer elfman says it means i 
work 12 hours a day seven days a week when im scoring you 
have soandso many minutes of music to write you have 30 days you 
have 60 minutes of music thats two minutes a day thats the 
bottom line an absolute 
writing songs for the band is the opposite i can never make 
myself write a song in fact thats a sure way not to write a song 
songs come when they damn well please 
elfman usually limits himself to two movie scores a year and 
some for television including the hit animated series the 
simpsons 
beatty lured elfman back from a vacation in the bahamas to talk 
about doing dick tracy elfman stalled beatty for a weekend of 
caribbean sun but couldnt refuse the job 
a recording of his score is one of three albums being released 
from the movie rock singer madonna who costars with beatty has 
an album on which she sings many of the stephen sondheim lyrics from 
the film a record of source music also is scheduled 
oingo boingos recent tour was a nice change of pace for elfman 
but its composing that most excites and frustrates him 
take batman elfman created the brooding musical backdrop 
yet pop star prince received most of the attention it was much 
later that music fans and the music press realized batman had 
elfmans score and princes soundtrack 
it was annoying for me before the movie came out that people 
didnt know the difference elfman artistically would prefer the 
score to be the only music to a movie but he understands marketing 
realities 
oingo boingo has contributed plenty of songs to film including 
flesh and blood from its current album to ghostbusters ii 
the title song to summer school and the theme song to weird 
science

when they list all the reasons why the stock 
market has shown so much enthusiasm over the latest slowdown in the 
economy most wall street analysts make no mention of the outlook 
for corporate profits 
in fact many of them acknowledge uncertainty about earnings 
prospects looms as a big potential stumbling block in the way of 
continued gains in stock prices from their recent record highs 
in the markets muchheralded advance since late april financial 
observers have cheered the drop in interest rates that greeted 
slowerthanexpected growth in employment and production 
it is also great news they say that the threat of a resurgence 
of inflation has faded as business activity turned sluggish again 
but followers of the market are left to wonder how long stocks 
can keep climbing without encouragement from hopes for a sustained 
expansion of earnings to justify higher share prices 
there seems to be too much heads we win tails we win 
thinking says rao chalasani analyst at prescott ball amp turben 
the clevelandbased investment firm there is no solid evidence 
that the profit margin squeeze is coming to an end 
or as byron wien writes in a current market commentary for morgan 
stanley amp co the current investment attitude does not look 
properly balanced only the sweet side of the slowdown is being 
factored into stock prices 
optimists maintain that stock traders as a group can sense 
favorable forces for the longterm profit outlook long before there 
is any tangible evidence that earnings are actually improving 
some may argue that economic data imply greater potential for 
recession and thus increase the risks for the stock market says 
michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton inc but we argue that 
these risks are acceptable even welcome if they result in lower 
inflation and interest rates 
although our profit forecasts are being lowered we believe 
that stocks sell on earning power relative to interest rates as 
well as on current earnings thus we expect the equity market to 
rise in the months ahead even given lower earnings expectations 
edward kirschner at painewebber inc contends that stock traders 
have actually been very discerning and discriminating in sorting out 
profit prospects of late in particular by bidding for companies 
with an international bent 
among individual stocks he says there are a very few strong 
market leaders trailed by many laggards among these winners there 
is a common theme behind their outperformance earnings earnings 
earnings 
the us economy is still a tough environment in which to make 
a buck certainly recent reports concerning housing starts retail 
sales industrial production and durable goods orders provide little 
evidence of a robust domestic economy 
by comparison kirschner adds foreign economies are 
wonderful they are growing much faster than the us 
we believe that the best place to find earnings is overseas 
where growth is stronger and us firms backed by a tougher us 
trade policy and changing foreign tastes are gaining market share 
on a less sanguine note wein cautions i dont think we will 
see the combination of higher earnings and lower interest rates that 
would support much higher prices

at the village vanguard legend has it you can 
tell how a band is doing just by listening to the room 
as interpreted by one veteran observer heres what the room had 
to say about the harper brothers 
it said they belong here insisted owner lorraine gordon 
whose jazz club was the setting for the harper brothers acclaimed 
live remembrance album the room did not reject it it said 
theyre wonderful here theyre going to come back 
of course the harper brothers a quintet featuring drummer 
winard harper and trumpeter philip harper have a few things to say 
about the vanguard a room lined with pictures of coleman hawkins 
miles davis and many others this is the jazz version of yankee 
stadium the kind of place you walk into and immediately think of 
those who played there before 
the good thing about it when we performed there and recorded 
it was that it was the first time that everybody in the band had 
recorded there winard recalled in a recent interview 
i remember going by in the afternoons setting up the drums i 
went by there with lorraine she walked me around the club telling 
me this is where such and so did this this is our charlie 
mingus light we never changed it because mingus got mad and hit 
this light 
there is no landmark yet for the harper brothers no light or 
floor panel or section on the wall 
they have plenty of time though winard is just 27 philip 24 
theyre still at the stage of their careers where theyre the ones 
telling the stories instead of having stories told about them 
the late dexter gordon is a favorite subject winard who says he 
has hours worth of taped conversations with the great saxophonist 
recalled seeing him in the mid1980s and got to play in his band 
the way dexter would act was mystifying to me he would stand 
on the edge and you didnt know if he was going to fall i got 
hooked i would go every night he said 
one night dexter came into the club real late he comes 
strolling in hes supposed to be in at 8 and he strolls in around 
11 the band was there on time so they were really mad when i 
walked in the regular drummer was tired and ready to go home and he 
asked me if i wanted to play we switched and dexter never knew 
the group which also includes alto sax player justin robinson 
pianist stephen scott and bassist kiyoshi kitagawa believes in 
tradition philip a hardhitting trumpeter is openly influenced by 
lee morgan while the flashy winard just so elegant is how 
lorraine gordon describes him follows the beat of tony williams 
they grew up in baltimore and atlanta and got their first musical 
experience playing in the rock n roll band of older brother danny 
in 1980 winard left atlanta he spent one semester at the 
cincinnati conservatory and eventually settled in washington 
forming the dc jazz quintet which philip joined 
now based in jersey city nj the harpers released their 
selftitled debut album in 1988 and took a chance by recording their 
next album in a city notorious for its hardtoplease jazz fans 
winard described new york audiences as conservative and 
philip went on to describe the problems of unwinding in front of 
rows of folded arms 
we had our fans there our family there was no doubt some 
great playing was on that release philip insisted i think 
still with everything going on knowing we were at the vanguard and 
doing a recording we probably werent as loose as we normally can 
be 
just working in new york itself can be different kind of 
scary theres no place like new york whenever you play in new 
york you got to be at your best you never know whos going to be 
around 
remembrance runs for over an hour and features horace 
silvers kiss me right plus originals by danny winard and 
philip harper two songs winards hodge podge and dannys 
remembrance are tributes to their late father hodges harper 
who introduced his kids to the music of lester young and other jazz 
greats 
he saw winard beating on the shoe polish cans and figured maybe 
he wants to learn the drums philip recalled my first love was 
the bass so they got me a guitar and it wasnt quite the same 
i wouldnt mess with the drums because we were always too 
competitive one day i heard a lee morgan record and it just amazed 
me that he could make it sound like that 
winard spoke again of dexter gordon he remembers the history 
lessons gordons stories of playing with billy eckstine and dating 
billie holiday and the special feelings of the jazz community he 
also talked of gordons style how much a young drummer could learn 
by just picking up on the rhythms of an experienced mans voice 
dexter he was an individual like lester young or theolonius 
monk those guys had so much personality something that was 
strictly theirs dexter just had a whole other langauge altogether 
youd hardly hear what he was saying because youd be in awe of how 
he was delivering it 
this music helps to bring out the individual its like the 
difference between something handmade and something factory made 
for us our main goal is to develop as much as possible and become 
as personal as possible as we grow and progess the more individual 
we become

jozsef palka shoved his sweatstained 
black fedora to the back of his head grimaced and spat into the 
dust of the road that runs through the village 
its not going to make them stop poking fun at us when we go 
into the store and speak our own language palka 51 said of 
romanias first free elections in 53 years in which the the ethnic 
hungarian party did very well 
hoots of agreement came from other residents of aghires a 
hungarian hamlet in transylvania 200 miles northwest of bucharest 
politics and nearly everything else are ethnic in transylvania 
which romanians and hungarians have contested for centuries 
palkas wife ilona 46 muttered the dog is dead but the chain 
is still there when asked whether the hungarians would fare better 
in a democracy than they had under communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
for the people of aghires life has been a them and us 
struggle with the ethnic romanian majority for generations 
romanians who remember the most recent period of hungarian rule 
during world war ii recite a litany of abuses 
hungary sided with germany in the war partly because of a 
promise that it would regain territory lost after world war i 
crimes have been committed by both sides over the centuries as 
transylvania a region rich in fertile land and minerals repeatedly 
changed hands it now makes up more than onethird of romania 
the indifference of past rulers to legitimate aspirations of the 
other nationality generated a deep enmity between the communities 
but they joined in the december uprising because ceausescus hand 
had fallen heavily on both 
when the dictator was overthrown and executed many of romanias 
22 million ethnic hungarians expected instant recognition of such 
demands those included university instruction in their own language 
and some local political power 
many romanians on the other hand saw the ethnic hungarian 
assertiveness as an attempt to wrest transylvania away from romania 
once again 
street fighing broke out in march at tirgu mures an evenly 
divided town of 300000 people about 175 miles northwest of 
bucharest six people were killed and more than 300 injured 
hungarian anxieties are most palpable in and around tirgu mures 
i go to a romanian school but in a hungarian class 
17yearold hajnalka barabas told a western visitor to chendu 15 
miles west of the town we really have to be careful 
i was stopped recently on the way home by romanian students 
and they said they would kill me she said another time 
they threw stones 
an elderly parking attendant at a hotel in tirgu mures beamed 
when addressed in hungarian 
i always speak hungarian first he said then i try german 
and french and only then romanian 
even the betterthanexpected election showing by the ethnic 
hungarian political party is a mixed blessing the hungarians fear 
the result was strong enough to increase romanian anxieties but too 
weak to achieve hungarian goals 
although the hungarian democratic federation in romania finished 
second nationally it got only 7 percent of the vote compared with 
66 percent for president ion iliescus winning national salvation 
front 
it ran first in the tirgu mures area where the results also 
reflected increased tensions caused by the violence in march 
the ethnic hungarian party won 40 percent amd a conservative 
alliance called aur which both hungarians and romanians view as 
antihungarian was second with 37 percent the national salvation 
front was a distant third with 16 percent 
istvan kiraly a senior member in tirgu mures of the hungarian 
democratic federation voiced the frustrations of many ethnic 
hungarians 
when the political parties look at us they look at us as 
hungarians and not at what our political platform is kiraly 43 
said in an interview nobody accepts us here in a country where 
the main aspect of politics was always based on nationalism 
he said every vote for the aur alliance was a vote against 
hungarians 
if the ethnic hungarian party should win regional elections next 
year the romanians could never accept this he said they 
think everyone different from them is a potential enemy we expect 
big battles 
the aur faction most feared by hungarians is vatra romaneasca a 
populist movement they accuse of instigating the march violence 
vatra romaneasca claims hungarian extremists started the trouble 
ioan czizmas a vatra member said of the ethnic hungarians 
they are like children who ask their parents why cant we 
have this why cant we have that they are looking for the first 
possibility to form an enclave then an autonomous transylvania

wealthy and discriminating male shoppers have 
known the zegna name for decades members of european royal families 
and affluent asian businessmen have zegna suits in their wardrobes 
the italian clothier hopes to capitalize on its cachet by opening 
a store of its own in the united states 
an elegant zegna menswear shop will debut around fathers day in 
the shoppers mecca of manhattans fifth avenue it will join a half 
dozen other zegna stores located at the right ritzy addresses in 
foreign fashion capitals 
by venturing into us retailing zegna wants to drum up more 
interest in its label the goal is to boost business for zegna 
merchandise sold around the country at upscale department stores 
such as neiman marcus and tony boutiques including ultimo in 
chicago and san franciscos wilkes bashford 
richard cohen president of ermenegildo zegna usa the italian 
groups american arm says the store is the centerpiece of a 
marketing strategy to enhance zegnas us wholesale business 
annual us sales volume has been running at roughly 20 million and 
cohen expects it will grow substantially over the next few years 
zegna pronounced to rhyme with kenya will be following the 
examples of classy lines like burberrys chanel hermes louis 
vuitton and others that increased american consumer awareness of 
their goods by opening stores here 
we like to think of ourselves in the same ilk as those 
companies cohen says 
the timing isnt perfect to launch into retailing obviously 
its not the best economic climate right now concedes cohen 
middleofthe road retailers have fallen by the wayside as 
specialty merchants have made inroads into their business 
discounters and generalists including the now vulnerablelooking 
goliath sears roebuck and co have discarded longheld pricing 
and merchandising practices in a bid to keep a grasp on market share 
still cohen is confident high quality goods he says have what 
it takes to attract customers even in tough times you continue to 
do well in bad economic times because youre offering value for 
money 
luxury retailers arent immune to problems if increasing numbers 
of consumers convert to more conservative buying habits but luxury 
really never goes out of style among people with loads of money who 
view every purchase even a new suit as an investment notes john 
mincarelli a professor at the fashion institute of technology in 
new york 
no matter what the economy is doing the time might be right for 
what zegna has to offer 
whats happened is were finding custom tailoring is becoming a 
status symbol again says mincarelli it always was but now its 
more pevalent 
mens fashion guru alan flusser an author designer and store 
owner believes a revival has begun in madetomeasure suits 
as prices of mens clothes have risen precipitously the 
difference between a good readymade suit and a good custommade 
suit has narrowed flusser says the custommade suit has had a 
rennaissance in this country 
indicating that a trend has developed more retailers and 
manufacturers with retail outlets are upgrading their tailoring 
services some bring their fabrics and samples to offices for 
customers too busy for instore shopping the ranks of these 
haberdashers who make house calls has expanded recently and include 
such mainstream quality clothing makers as hartmarx 
zegna will offer roving tailors too the fitters will visit 
offices and elsewhere to accomodate customers needing to be measured 
for alterations on readymade clothing or for custommade suits the 
store will schedule private appointments for afterhours customers 
the name of the game in this day and age is service cohen 
says when your customer is available is when you make yourself 
available 
at the top of the scale a madetomeasure suit will retail at an 
average price of around 1500 a customers measurements will be 
faxed to italy where all the work will be done delivery is promised 
in 4 weeks 
the zegna store will stock offtherack suits ranging from 900 
to 1500 with free alterations done on the premises if thats too 
pricey for someone keen to buy into the zegna image there will be 
casual shirts for 60 to 65 and casual slacks for 225 to 250 
ties go for about 85 
ermenegildo zegna named for his grandfather who built the 
business and known simply as gildo says much of what makes the 
company special is that it is still run by the founding family 
the company based in trivero italy oversees the production of 
the wool and other raw materials that zegna weaves into fabrics that 
become clothing to encourage sheep breeders to maintain or improve 
the quality of their flocks zegna periodically awards prizes 
gildo zegna said in an interview during a spring visit to new 
york that the company aspires to growth but not to the extent that 
it could jeopardize quality or image 
in terms of distribution we want to keep it very exclusive and 
selective he says we are not interested to grow beyond a 
certain point

its no longer unusual to see debtfinanced 
takeovers go bust soon after completion but some older deals have 
started to sour too which shows that buying with borrowed money 
carries risks that last for years 
rh macy amp co inc went private in a 374 billion leveraged 
buyout led by management in 1986 accomplished with bank loans and 
sales of junk bonds the risky highyield securities that financed 
the 80s takeover boom 
four years later the retailer is 567 billion in debt and 
after a disastrous christmas shopping season concerned creditors 
are looking over its shoulder 
greyhound lines inc the nations biggest intercity bus company 
was taken private in 1987 by an investor group that paid 350 
million and relied heavily on junk bonds for the purchase money 
last week greyhound which has been hit hard by a 
threemonthold drivers strike filed for bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors 
the investors who bought these companies years ago never expected 
to be in trouble at this late date what went wrong 
too much debt and not enough margin for error and unexpected 
problems the same things that have waylaid younger buyouts like 
campeau corps failed 1988 takeover of federated department stores 
inc 
highly leveraged deals like these are fine as long as things go 
well but as soon as things go even slightly bad the fallout 
doesnt take very long to occur said jerome e hass professor of 
managerial economics and finance at cornell universitys johnson 
graduate school of management 
these are deals that were exceedingly thin hass said 
so when macy suffered a loss at christmas and greyhounds fleet 
was stalled by labor problems the companies were short of cash 
needed to pay bills including hefty interest charges 
like many other highly leveraged firms macy and greyhound did 
not plan years ago for unexpected events 
you kind of know whats going to happen in the next year but 
five years hence you dont really know said robert w vishny a 
university of chicago graduate school of business finance professor 
it is a case where you are potentially setting yourself up for 
trouble vishny said 
some of the shortsightedness comes from overly optimistic sales 
earnings projections particularly for retailers 
walter loeb a retailing analyst and consultant said macy had 
budgeted for a 10 percent annual increase in sales but like the 
rest of the retail industry has fallen far short of the mark 
the greyhound and macy buyouts arent the only older deals to 
encounter rough sledding southland corp which went private in a 
49 billion leveraged buyout in 1987 recently said it was selling 
out to a japanese firm because it couldnt handle the debt load 
southland like macy and campeau is a retailer hit by declining 
sales that it did not forecast while it looks nice on paper most 
retailing lbos have had a detrimental effect on the companies 
loeb said 
but macy exacerbated its problems by making a big acquisition 
after its lbo 
macy spent more than 1 billion to buy two department store 
chains from campeau in 1988 after the two companies had fought one 
another in a monthlong takeover battle for federated 
ironically macy had bid more for federated than campeau which 
ended up paying 66 billion for the retailer plus another 22 
billion in expenses campeau was unable to handle its debt bill and 
ultimately ended up in bankruptcy court 
greyhound meanwhile spent 80 million several months after its 
own buyout to purchase assets of its competitor trailways lines inc 
in hindsight neither macy nor greyhound could really afford 
their new acquisitions 
greyhounds problems will be resolved in bankruptcy court the 
estimates are it will take six months to a year to reorganize the 
company 
macy meanwhile is expected to weather the storm on its own the 
companys latest quarterly earnings report issued last week 
reassured junk bond investors 
loeb said macy management especially company chairman edward 
finkelstein has kept an open line of communications to suppliers 
creditors and investors 
that was an asset loeb said

while wall street has dramatically changed its 
view of the economic outlook in the past couple of months it is 
having trouble persuading the federal reserve to do the same 
analysts in the financial world have interpreted recent 
statistics on the economy as showing a lot less growth than earlier 
had been supposed 
but the fed has so far made no move to oblige bulls in the bond 
and stock markets by adopting a more stimulative credit policy and 
encouraging interest rates to keep falling 
the central bank has sent out a variety of signals in recent days 
that it isnt gravely worried about any impending recession in 
spite of stagnating employment growth over the last three months 
instead it still seems to be more concerned with keeping the 
brakes on inflation even with recent evidence that upward pressures 
on the cost of living have eased 
the latest economic data move the fed closer to an easing of 
monetary policy but it is unlikely that such a move will take place 
before the third quarter say economists at the investment firm of 
kidder peabody amp co 
the fed has made no change for more than 15 months in its 
discount rate the charge it sets on loans to private financial 
institutions and its most publicized tool for influencing changes 
in the flow of money and credit through the banking system it has 
stood at 7 percent since feb 24 1989 
in a further reflection of the steadyasshegoes approach by 
taken by chairman alan greenspan the interest rate on federal 
funds or overnight loans between banks has hovered around 825 
percent since january of this year 
to some this stands as evidence that the fed has found the 
correct way to keeping the economy on a path of slow growth despite 
such disrupting influences as the savings and loan crisis 
at the same time it has attracted a steady stream of criticism 
from people in both government and private business who contend that 
the economy is expanding too slowly 
as hopes ebbed on wall street for an early move toward stimulus 
by the fed stock prices tumbled giving up some of the gains that 
carried the market to record highs as recently as monday the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3859 to 286238 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 198 to 19605 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market lost 127 
to 46087 and the american stock exchange market value index was 
down 266 at 36117 
volume on the big board averaged 16846 million shares a day 
against 17262 million the week before 
if the fed is going to get more accommodative many analysts 
believe it could do so in early july once policymakers get a look 
at another set of employment statistics 
the chances for such a change might be further enhanced with 
favorable readings on the consumer price index for may and june 
if the cpi is moderate for another month or two the monetary 
authorities are likely to lower the target on the federal funds rate 
by a notch or two to signal their intent to support the expansion 
said richard rippe at dean witter reynolds inc 
traders in the bond and stock markets indeed appear to be banking 
on significantly improved inflation news 
says william melton at ids financial services in minneapolis 
our belief is that the stage is being set for a spell of inflation 
around 3 percent a welcome relief after the 85 percent annualized 
rate during the first quarter

it was almost as if san franciscos 
legendary fog invaded the conference where banking authorities from 
22 nations were talking about the economic future of eastern europe 
the man responsible for sweeping changes there appeared in the same 
hotel but the bankers never saw him 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev failed to take advantage of 
the gathering of some of the worlds most powerful commerical and 
government bank officials at the international monetary conference 
this past week instead he tried to drum up investment from 
california business leaders 
organizers of the annual gathering of about 200 bankers said they 
spoke to soviet embassy officials in washington about scheduling an 
appearance by gorbachev who stopped in california after his summit 
with president bush but the bankers never received a reply 
several conference participants said they believed the soviet 
leader blew an important opportunity to discuss his nations need 
for investment with those holding the keys to the vaults 
but an address by gorbachev to the bankers may have fallen on 
deaf ears anyway several prominent conference participants said the 
soviet union has a long way to go in restructuring its economy 
before western financiers would feel comfortable investing there 
at a news conference top officials of the central banks of 
japan england france and the united states were asked what lessons 
they had learned from their large loans to south america in the 
1970s many of which have gone sour 
jacques de larosiere governor of the bank of france said the 
principal lesson is that a nation must have made substantial 
capitalist economic reforms to be considered a suitable candidate 
for bank loans 
larosiere said mexico was a good example of a borrower that has 
taken such major steps as selling off governmentowned industry and 
loosening regulation of business he said the west must press 
eastern europe to enact similar reforms 
that thought was echoed by us treasury secretary nicholas brady 
in an address before the bankers 
the countries that move forcefully to privatize stateowned 
operations to open trading and investment regimes and to withdraw 
the government from the marketplace will be the ones tht attract the 
capital to fuel growth brady said 
takeshi ohta a deputy governor of the bank of japan said loans 
by governmentsponsored banks such as the world bank may be needed 
before private banks feel secure in committing their money to the 
former communist nations 
but brady indicated that little additional aid to eastern europe 
would come from the us government he told the bankers that they 
must be willing to lend money to these countries despite concerns 
about credit risk 
as more countries embrace the principles of economic freedom 
creditors will need to stand ready to lend their support he said 
you in this room cannot simply be bystanders to this process 
two former top government financial officials said the us 
should do its part to free up capital needed by eastern europe by 
trimming the federal deficit which is financed by treasury 
borrowing that could be going elsewhere 
former federal reserve board chairman paul volcker told the 
bankers that the united states must curb domestic spending both 
public and private according to a text of his remarks in the 
closeddoor sessions 
volcker also said that nations particularly the united states 
must take steps to increase the rate of savings which will boost 
the amount of money available for borrowing by the former soviet 
bloc 
nigel lawson former chancellor of the exchequer in great 
britain seconded volckers plea for greater private savings 
he said governments must stop draining away investment funds by 
running budget deficits according to a copy of his remarks lawson 
did not specifically mention the united states 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
bankruptcy court was the forum for more debtdistressed 
companies greyhound lines sought chapter 11 protection from 
creditors partly the result of a prolonged strike ames department 
stores inc said it would close nearly a third of its 679 outlets 
reflecting the discounters efforts to dump moneylosing operations 
since seeking bankruptcy court refuge in april 
conagra inc will acquire beatrice co for 134 billion from 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the deal represents the last chunk of 
what had been a much larger beatrice bought by kohlberg in 1986 and 
will make conagra one of the worlds biggest food companies 
general motors corp outdid competitors and won a 1 billion 
fiveyear agreement to supply parts to the soviet unions auto 
industry the deal is one of the largest by a western company in the 
east bloc 
flamboyant developer donald j trump faced growing pressure from 
lenders feeling queasy about his debtridden complex of casinos 
hotels and other property despite increased speculation that trump 
will be forced to sell assets in order to pay bills aides said none 
of his atlantic city hotels were for sale
