pastor christian fuehrer whose st 
nicholas church was the birthplace of the candlelight 
revolution is disheartened the rebellion unleased nationalist 
fervor and a chase for western riches 
the coca cola culture is taking over and people are rushing 
blindly to exchange one set of chains for another the 
47yearold lutheran minister said in a recent interview in his 
apartment overlooking the downtown church 
as he spoke dozens of western vendors in nearby karl marx 
square were selling goods like ice cream and bananas for inflated 
prices at other stalls west german activists campaigning for 
their east german sister parties in sundays election were handing 
out glossy stickers 
later that day about 300000 people jammed the square to hear 
west german chancellor helmut kohl deliver campaign promises of 
affluence for all in a united germany helmut helmut 
chanted the supporters waving hundreds of west german flags 
only five months ago such scenes would have been unthinkable in 
this industrial city of 565000 about 125 miles southwest of 
berlin 
in early october the communists still held a tight grip on the 
country but the widespread dissatisfaction fomenting for years was 
beginning to bubble to the surface 
discontent was especially strong in polluted and rundown 
leipzig and the city took the lead in the revolt 
the spark came from the st nicholas church where the 
jeansclad minister for years had provided refuge and meeting space 
for dissidents every monday night antigovernment peace 
prayers took place at the lutheran church 
the prayers usually drew a few hundred people but on oct 9 
thousands flocked to the church angered by the repression of a 
prodemocracy protest two days earlier 
after that mondays prayers 70000 demonstrators chanting we 
are the people marched through leipzig in the largest public 
protest held in 40 years of totalitarian rule 
other cities joined in and eventually the old communist leaders 
were toppled a communistled caretaker government opened the 
borders on nov 9 and scheduled elections for sunday 
its still hard to understand how christs spirit of 
nonviolence took hold of these people most of whom are not 
christians said fuehrer a ministers son who often quotes marx 
they had lived through 40 years of marxism and atheism and 
they behaved as if they had grown up with the sermon on the 
mount said fuehrer this was the highlight of my life 
fuehrer said the lutheran church the only institution not 
controlled by the communists did not initiate the uprising but 
made it possible my role was to keep the church door open he 
said 
after the heady days of october when thousands jammed into the 
church st nicholas is empty again 
one recent day only about 50 people came to hear pastor arndt 
haubolds thoughts on the upcoming elections the sermon turned out 
to be a subtle endorsement of alliance 90 a group of mainly 
leftwing dissidents who were at the forefront of the struggle who 
are not expected to score big in the election 
most of the listeners were elderly women the traditional church 
audience before the revolt 
its pretty bad that we dont have more people here said 
22yearold chemistry student karsten bigl one of the early 
activists last year he acknowledged he had attended only because 
he happened to pass on a shopping trip 
bigl said he felt betrayed by his fellow east germans who are 
becoming increasingly hostile toward leftwing groups that want to 
prevent a merger with west germany or slow down the pace 
the people who started everything are already being denounced 
as red pigs said bigl 
many east germans who long have yearned for the affluence 
presented to them nightly on west german television and felt like 
beggars peeping through the palace window see quick unification as 
the sure ticket for catching up 
but fuehrer warned that east germans must first deal with their 
tainted past noting that millions of people had belonged to the 
communist party or collaborated with the secret police 
we need time for shame and remorse said fuehrer 
fuehrer said he foresees difficult times for the church 
the coming affluence will be a much more formidable opponent 
than marxism because people are dancing voluntarily around the 
golden calf he said 
but he added with a wink we have lived through 40 years of 
socialism and we will also survive german unity

alexander yakovlev a member of the congress of 
peoples deputies pronounced himself satisfied with the pace of 
democracys development in the soviet union 
democracy is just rising from the cradle in the communist 
state said yakovlev a key adviser to president mikhail s

in preparation for writing a new one for the soviet union this 
baby works very well considering his age and notverygood family 
tradition 
look at the public how attentively they watch how they 
absorb whats going on politically he said 
indeed after the first session of congress a year ago was 
broadcast live the government announced that henceforth the 
proceedings would be recorded and shown on national television only 
after working hours it seems the nations productivity not 
something bragged about in the best of times plummeted 20 percent 
during the televised debates 
undeterred soviets gathered last week around their televisions 
every night to watch their fledgling congress fumble through the 
birth of a government of laws the hours of often tedious

skeptics watched one floor fight after another result in defeat 
for progressive deputies trying to buck gorbachevs iron will less 
apparent to the public was the work of the reformers who struggled 
in committee and won limitations on what they saw as potentially 
dictatorial powers gorbachev originally sought 
but the outcome was not long in doubt gorbachevs presidential 
campaign lasted 2 hours he was the sole candidate and never made 
a campaign speech when both men nominated to run against him 
refused to do so deputies tried to force them to stay in the race 
to give it at least the appearance of a competitive election

the oneman race was not however a mere excuse to venerate the 
leader as it would have been in earlier days some deputies seized 
the opportunity to express their anger and frustration 
a group of deputies representing agrarian interests went to the 
podium to nominate gorbachev apparently because they wanted the 
floor to raise a number of sore points as their delegate put 
it 
a deputy in military uniform demanded gorbachev not be made 
commanderinchief of the armed forces without at least taking a 
few lessons in military strategy he hinted that the superpower 
leader really ought to go back and serve the obligatory military 
service he somehow escaped in a land where practically all young 
men are drafted 
the deputy practicing a bit of pork barrel politics for his 
military constituency also demanded gorbachev give apartments to 
every veteran by may 9 the national holiday marking the soviets 
victory over the nazis 
should mikhail sergeyevich become a czar it would not change 
the situation said taxi driver leonid sukhov a deputy who first 
captured the worlds attention when he compared gorbachev to 
napoleon under the spell of a josephine his wife raisa 
people in my region get seven grams of butter and 20 grams of 
sausage a day said a delegate from perm food is being 
rationed and i protest the praise being lavished on our leaders

gorbachev sat stonefaced through it all 
he did have a few moments of enjoyment however when a kazakh 
deputy suggested gorbachev be elected president because he still 
remembers what the wheel of a combine looks like 
the soviet leader grew up in a farm village in southern russia 
and worked with his father as a combine operator before winning a 
coveted place as a student at moscow state university 
and perhaps he could find faint praise in the speech of another 
deputy 
the fierce and fiery anna kanarovskaya was positively snarling 
when she stomped to the podium and said khrushchev banged his 
shoe on the table brezhnev had his speeches written for him and 
nearly lost his artificial teeth 
we always appear ridiculous before the world she said 
for the first time im not ashamed

the only frolicking the federal 
government wants on a nude beach in rhode island is by a small 
group of birds whose existence is considered threatened 
the us fish and wildlife service has decided that the secluded 
and popular moonstone beach will be offlimits for nude sunbathers 
this summer in order to protect the tiny piping plover 
moonstone has been the only spot on the 420mile rhode island 
coast and one of few along the new england shore where nudists 
can sun in the buff 
but federal officials and environmental groups say that when 
humans enter the piping plover exits the bird is listed on the 
federal endangered species list as threatened a step away from the 
designation of endangered 
the human activity serves as a distraction to the plovers 
said james kurth manager of the trustom pond national wildlife 
refuge which includes moonstone beach theyre constantly moved 
away from their breeding grounds he cited a university of 
massachusetts study more than a decade ago that showed plovers will 
leave an area where humans congregate 
nudists see the battle over the bird as a subterfuge to the 
underlying issue they claim the government wants northeastern 
shores free of nude sunbathers 
they also say they can coexist with the little bird and in 
fact have for years 
it doesnt have anything to do with the animal unless the 
people are bothering them said ron laporte of glastonbury 
conn as he lounged on a blanket on the sundrenched beach 
thursday morning he was bundled in a denim jacket against a sea 
breeze 
birds are important but the public is important too said 
dave gillis of warrensville conn also sunning himself on the 
beach we paid for this beach theyve got to consider the 
people 
the controversy over moonstone has been simmering for years but 
when the fish and wildlife service expanded its holdings in 1982 
nudists and clothed beachgoers began to feel a little more 
unwelcome 
for one thing their beach kept shrinking 
in 1982 the federal government obtained land from the audubon 
society and took control of about a mile of the coast kurth said 
the following summer about threequarters of a mile was closed a 
fence erected last year left a thin strip along the waters edge 
for sunbathers 
this year when the plovers come back around the last week of 
march that fence will go to the high tide mark along the entire 
length of beach to keep sunbathers clothed and naked out 
were applauding them very loudly said alfred hawkes 
executive director of the audubon society hawkes said his group 
had objected to the nude sunbathers but had been unable to keep 
them out 
hawkes said the sandy strip of coast appears to be ideally 
suited to plovers so tiny that adults reach only 7 inches on one 
side lies the blue expanse of ocean beyond sand dunes on the other 
side is the freshwater trustom pond 
in the early 1970s piping plovers and least terns were nesting 
there regularly hawkes said it got pretty much out of hand in 
the late 70s once the word got around among nudists the crowd 
grew very quickly 
nudists said they are being branded unfairly as antibird 
there seems to be some bias functioning here although its 
denied by officials said lee baxandall of osh kosh wis 
president of the nationwide naturist society there is no federal 
law against nudity

senate majority leader george mitchell is 
labeling president bushs comment on jewish settlers in east 
jerusalem a heavyhanded blunder that jeopardizes the middle 
east peace process 
in a harsh statement issued friday mitchell charged that bushs 
statement two weeks ago represented thoughtless insensitivity or 
conscious provocation and hastened the downfall of israels 
coalition government 
a more heavyhanded blunder is difficult to imagine said 
mitchell dmaine 
bush at a news conference march 3 in palm springs calif 
listed east jerusalem as among the areas where the united states 
wants to see an end to new israeli settlements 
the administration says the presidents statement was consistent 
with longstanding us policy which holds that the israeli 
settlements in occupied territory add to tensions and are 
detrimental to peace efforts and bush earlier this week dismissed 
suggestions that his remark had contributed to israels current 
political crisis 
but recent us policy statements have focused on settlements in 
the west bank and gaza strip not mentioning east jerusalem bushs 
comment gave new visibility to the disputed area 
mitchell said the remarks cast doubt upon americas intentions 
and role in promoting peace in the middle east 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
friday that the turmoil in israel meant obviously there is a 
pause in moving the peace process forward 
but she added that thursdays vote in the israeli parliament to 
dissolve the government was being read by the administration as a 
focus on the peace issue and the importance of moving forward 
tutwiler added we recognize that this is a delicate time in 
israel and we look forward to working closely with the israeli 
government that emerges we will continue to work together to 
bring peace to this region 
in his statement mitchell gave the administration credit for 
investing much time and energy in encouraging israel to accept a 
proposal to hold elections among palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
there had been a process of building confidence and enhancing 
trust among all parties mitchell said president bushs 
comments have undermined that progress trust is easily shattered 
confidence can quickly evaporate 
mitchell added there was simply no reason to suddenly thrust 
into the forefront of debate the issue of jewish israelis rights 
to live in east jerusalem 
certainly the status of east jerusalem must be decided as part 
of a negotiated comprehensive peace but the presidents comments 
served no purpose but to impede progress toward establishing the 
very process needed to resolve this issue 
mitchells criticism came as many activist democrats on capitol 
hill are expressing restiveness over their leaderships failure to 
take bush on more directly and forcefully at a time when the 
president is enjoying high popularity ratings in the polls 
but an aide to mitchell said the comments were meant simply to 
register clear disagreement with bush over the east jerusalem 
statement and not to quiet any grumbling among congressional 
democrats

oliver north was so selfassured he sat in 
president reagans chair when answering questions from lawmakers at 
a meeting he has testified he attended reluctantly according to 
testimony at the trial of his former boss john poindexter 
poindexter who is charged with obstructing and lying to 
lawmakers didnt trust congress and preferred to have as little 
as possible to do with the legislative branch of government 
another witness testified 
fridays testimony by two former white house aides focused on an 
aug 6 1986 meeting in which north lied to house intelligence 
committee members by denying he was assisting the contras 
militarily 
north walked into the white house situation room and the only 
vacant seat was for the president so north sat there testified 
robert pearson a former national security council lawyer 
north admitted in testimony at the trial this week that he lied 
when he made the denials about contra assistance north said 
poindexter the national security adviser sent him to the meeting 
even though he had told poindexter he didnt think it was a good 
idea 
you certainly didnt get the impression that when oliver north 
sat in that chair the president usually occupies that he was doing 
any dirty work for admiral poindexter richard beckler 
poindexters lawyer said to pearson 
i did not get that impression replied pearson 
earlier beckler asked ronald sable an nsc legislative liaison 
whether north expressed any reluctance about appearing before the 
committee 
no replied sable 
was he nervous asked beckler 
not that i recall said sable 
what was norths demeanor asked beckler 
typical oliver north positive said sable 
sable testified that oliver north was somebody if you wanted 
something done he would get it done but you might not be sure how 
he got it done 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress and lying to 
lawmakers by covering up norths contra assistance and the us 
role in a november 1985 missile shipment to iran 
admiral poindexter was skeptical of the congress sable 
testified he had not had much to do with congress and that was 
his preference that he would just as soon not deal with them 
he indicated he didnt trust them he said 
what about whether he liked them asked irancontra 
prosecutor howard pearl 
that fell in the same category said sable now a corporate 
lobbyist on capitol hill 
irancontra prosecutors said they expect to complete their case 
monday their final witnesses will be former house intelligence 
committee chairman us rep lee hamilton and eric newsome 
formerly a senate intelligence committee staffer

secretary of state james a baker iii in his 
first try at onsite african diplomacy will urge south african 
president fw de klerk next week to end a 3year state of 
emergency and release all remaining political prisoners 
but baker is not about to stiffen us sanctions against south 
africa as urged by nelson mandela the black activist de klerk 
freed last month after 27 years in prison 
we think now is not the time to think of more sanctions but to 
think in terms of negotiations and how we can encourage that a 
senior us official said friday as the state department announced 
bakers trip to africa 
included is a meeting with mandela in windhoek the capital of 
namibia while baker is attending ceremonies marking the 
independence of africas newest nation 
in cape town baker will meet with de klerk south african 
foreign minister rf botha anglican bishop desmond tutu and black 
critics of the government 
the purpose of our seeing these gentlemen is to encourage 
negotiations to move as rapidly as possible and to see what we can 
do to contribute to that the us official said 
the south african government announced on friday meanwhile 
that it would begin talks with mandela and exiled leaders of the 
african national congress on april 11 
were very encouraged by the announcement the baker aide 
said 
the trip is the first by a secretary of state to africa in seven 
years and the first to south africa since 1978 
the official who briefed reporters under rules that he would 
not be identified praised strides made by both whites and blacks 
in south africa 
the mainstream of the white community has effectively decided 
to end apartheid through negotiations with the black majority he 
said we think it is very significant 
at the same time the official said we also find it 
significant that the leadership of the black majority has 
reciprocated this step 
that is a change from an attitude of confrontation and a time 
when negotiations were never in the picture he said 
randall robinson the executive director of transafrica 
supported bakers decision to talk with de klerk as an 
opportunity to advance a muchneeded dialogue on dismantling of 
apartheid 
but robinson whose black group has campaigned for years against 
apartheid in south africa objected to president bushs invitation 
to de klerk to meet with him in the white house because of the 
symbolic message of support and acceptance it would send 
no date has been set for a visit by the south african president

hundreds of armed contra rebel troops are 
defying calls for their demobilization and instead are 
reinfiltrating nicaragua a government source says 
the rebels who still are receiving us food aid have slipped 
back into nicaragua from their jungle camps along the border with 
honduras since just before the countrys feb 25 presidential 
elections said the source who spoke friday on condition of 
anonymity 
the bush administration and nicaraguan presidentelect violeta 
chamorro have repeatedly called on the contras to disarm and 
demobilize 
us officials believe the recent infiltration has swelled 
numbers of rebel troops inside nicaragua from about 3500 to as 
many as 5000 said the source while acknowledging the numbers are 
soft 
authority to spend new funds to support the contras ran out feb 
28 but the state departments agency for international development 
is continuing to provide cash for food to the troops from money 
already in the aid pipeline 
we are still in effect subsidizing an army inside 
nicaragua said the source who added that food money was 
continuing at a level consistent with 3500 troops and not the 
increased number 
in all some 10000 contra rebels are believed to still be under 
arms down from a peak of some 16000 
word of the reinfiltration came as vice president dan quayle on 
friday urged nicaraguas usbacked rebels to disarm and return 
home to help the newly elected government 
but a rebel leader said such a move hinged on the sandinista 
militia laying down its arms as well 
now is the time to stop the fighting and begin the peace 
process quayle just back from a weeklong trip to south 
america said at the start of a meeting with three representatives 
of the contras we want to see the demobilization of the 
resistance 
chamorro who is to assume the presidency april 25 is 
negotiating the transition with defeated president daniel ortega 
the leader of the contra delegation said the rebels wanted to 
disarm and return home to farm but also wanted assurances the 
sandinista forces would demobilize too 
what we need is total demilitarization said the contra 
representative known only as commander franklin 
quayle who met with ortega during his south american trip 
conceded that mistrust between the contras and sandinistas was 
complicating efforts to reach agreement on repatriation of the 
rebels 
the contras dont trust the sandinistas the sandinistas dont 
trust the contras quayle said but he also told reporters i 
am confident that daniel ortega will turn power over to violeta 
chamorro and our challenge now is to work on the transition so mrs 
chamorro will have the best opportunity possible to govern 
to that end quayle urged congress to act swiftly on the 300 
million nicaraguan aid package president bush unveiled tuesday 
quayle said the south american leaders with whom he had met 
exhibited strong support for the package and said the 
agricultural aid included would quicken efforts to repatriate the 
contras

environmental claims for a variety of consumer 
products from trash bags to hair spray are being investigated 
by the federal trade commission which says it will vigorously 
pursue deceptive advertising and packaging 
ftc chairman janet steiger said friday the agency has joined a 
task force of state attorneys general to determine whether 
environmental claims made by the products can be substantiated 
consumers who buy environmentally friendly products in hopes 
of bettering the environment cannot themselves judge whether such 
products will deliver the promised benefits ms steiger told the 
consumer federation of america on friday 
many consumer products have appeared in stores over the past 
year claiming they benefit the environment the products range from 
degradable plastic trash bags to ozonefriendly hair 
spray to diapers said to decompose in landfills 
no specific companies were named as targets by the ftc 
the federal action comes as attorneys general from eight states 
have been investigating environmental claims on consumer products 
earlier in the week the task force held meetings in minneapolis 
that attracted representatives from dozens of companies and 
environmental organizations 
adding a flower the sunshine or a whale to your label is not 
enough declared attorney general hubert humphrey iii of 
minnesota other states involved with the task force are texas 
massachusetts missouri wisconsin california new york and 
washington 
various environmental groups have said the environmentoriented 
marketing claims often are misleading 
earlier this week the environmental group greenpeace released a 
report saying that claims about plastic items such as trash bags 
and diapers are misleading and in many cases false although 
plastic products may break into small pieces those pieces still 
cause environmental concerns the group said 
manufacturers of degradable plastics are appealing to 
consumers environmental concerns on a basic emotional level with 
little regard for whether their claims are supported by scientific 
evidence said the greenpeace report 
many of the product manufacturers however defend their claims 
and said friday they welcomed the ftcs investigation 
what were seeing now is a great deal of disinformation 
said timothy draeger executive director of the st louisbased 
degradable plastics council the ftc normally looks into things 
like this we welcome their participation 
a survey last year of 1000 adults by the management consulting 
firm michael peters group showed nearly nine in 10 people were 
concerned about products impact on the environment eight in 10 
said they would pay extra for a product packaged with recyclable or 
biodegradable material 
the producers of plastic trash bags have turned to environmental 
marketing on a grand scale 
a spokesman for mobil chemical corp which makes the hefty 
degradable trash bag said its claims that the bags degrade in 
sunlight have been fully substantiated by tests and that the 
company never said the bags would be the answer to the countrys 
waste disposal problem 
mobil spokesman allen gray acknowledged in an interview that the 
company began marketing the degradable bags because of competitive 
pressures 
were in the business of selling bags the consumer out 
there has an extremely high positive association with degradable 
products our competition has come out with degradable products and 
were responding said gray 
bob chickering president of american enviro products also 
vigorously defends his bunnies diapers which are marketed as 
being biodegradable 
i would like someone to show us that it doesnt work said 
chickering who acknowledged that his product is among those being 
looked into by the ftc he says hes sold 100 million bunnies 
diapers since they went on the market eight months ago 
the bunnies diapers use a cornstarch additive produced by 
archer daniels midland co to hasten the breakup of the plastic

us trade negotiators are claiming some 
success in talks aimed at opening the japanese market to the sale 
of more us lumber products but two members of congress contend 
much more needs to be done 
a us trade official who briefed reporters friday on condition 
of anonymity said that two days of discussion this week produced 
some willingness by the japanese to lower tariffs on laminated wood 
products and to allow more lumber to be used in construction 
however the official said both sides remained far apart that on 
many of the american demands lumber is one of three areas along 
with satellites and supercomputers where negotiators are trying 
to remove japanese trade barriers in an effort to reduce the united 
states 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
if barriers are not removed by a june 16 deadline the bush 
administration has the power to retaliate by raising tariffs on 
japanese products 
sen max baucus dmont the chairman of a senate trade 
subcommittee said it was much too early to claim success 
in order to succeed we must keep the pressure on japan he 
said in a statement general positive statements dont open 
markets agreements do 
a congressman from another lumberproducing state rep ron 
wyden dore said friday in a letter to bush that progress so far 
had been minimal 
we have put forward a broad agenda of reasonable changes in 
the japanese system of tariffs standards and codes changes which 
will benefit japanese consumers as well as us producers wyden 
said the japanese response has been limited shortsighted and 
destined to increase trade tension between our two nations 
the discussions along with negotiations aimed at removing 
broadranging structural barriers to trade were reviewed at a 
recent summit meeting between president bush and japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu 
talks this week on wood products and satellites and discussions 
next week on supercomputers are the first negotiations held since 
the bushkaifu summit 
while some progress was made in the wood dispute negotiators 
reported zero progress on satellites and said no further 
meetings would be held unless the japanese side was willing to move 
from its current position 
the trade official said an eighth round of talks on wood would 
be held in early april in tokyo 
we want a package to significantly open up the japanese 
markets the us official said we are disappointed with the 
rate of progress but we are not despairing we still have some 
time left 
he said the japanese had indicated a willingness to revise their 
building codes to allow greater use of american lumber although 
they still object to making as many changes as the us seeks 
the official said there also was some movement on a us demand 
that tariffs on two types of laminated wood products be lowered to 
39 percent down from a current 15 percent to 20 percent 
the us lumber industry currently exports 28 billion in 
products annually to japan the bulk of that in raw logs the 
industry has estimated that japanese barriers translate into 1 
billion to 2 billion in lost sales to us producers

a small virginia aerospace company is 
proposing a plan in which shuttle astronauts would attach a rocket 
to a lowflying 150 million satellite and send it to a useful life 
22300 miles above earth 
an intelsat satellite failed to achieve its proper orbit this 
week after launch atop a titan 3 rocket from cape canaveral fla 
on friday rocket builder martin marietta attributed the failure to 
a wiring problem in the titan 
a bold and coordinated team effort involving nasa martin 
marietta hughes and osc can successfully complete this mission 
for intelsat robert r lovell of orbital sciences corp wrote 
to nasa administrator richard truly and others 
kerry masson a martin marietta spokeswoman in denver said that 
during the launch a signal failed to make it from an onboard 
computer to the mechanism that was to separate the rocket and the 
satellite 
without that separation a motor attached to the satellite was 
unable to propel the spacecraft to its high orbit when engineers 
finally separated satellite and spent shell the booster rocket 
remained with the launch vehicle and both are expected to fall back 
to earth soon 
intelsat which owns the 150 million uninsured satellite fired 
small onboard thrusters and raised the satellites orbit by nearly 
60 miles friday putting the 5ton satellite out of immediate reach 
of the atmosphere 
orbital sciences corp proposed that its new rocket device 
called a transfer orbit stage be carried to orbit on the shuttle 
and be mated to the satellite 
that said osc would complete the mission from orbit rather 
than returning the satellite to earth for refurbishment and 
relaunch 
the transfer orbit stage is designed to boost spacecraft from 
low earth orbit to the 22300 milehigh altitude at which 
communications satellites operate the device was qualified for 
space flight only in january

jury deliberations in joseph 
hazelwoods trial may coincide with the first anniversary of the 
exxon valdez oil spill but the judge says that is no reason for 
jurors to be sequestered 
superior court judge karl johnstone on friday turned down a bid 
by hazelwoods lawyers to have jurors stay at a hotel with bailiffs 
guarding them during their deliberations next week in the skippers 
criminal trial 
johnstone said that under alaska law requests for jury 
sequestration must come before a jury is sworn in unless there is 
good cause to do so later 
he said the defense request was not timely and he did not 
consider approaching publicity about the anniversary as good 
cause for not allowing jurors to go home each night 
defense attorney dick madson argued that the marking of one year 
since the nations largest oil spill last march 24 will bring a 
flood of publicity and possible demonstrations in the vicinity of 
the anchorage courthouse 
final arguments are scheduled for tuesday and johnstone said he 
hopes to instruct jurors in the law and submit the case to them the 
same day legal discussions of jury instructions are scheduled for 
monday 
the exxon valdez ran aground in prince william sound last march 
24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude oil which 
devastated fisheries and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles 
of rocky shore 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is the only member of the 
ships crew to face criminal charges he is accused of a felony 
criminal mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 7 years 
in prison and fined 61000 
in a court session on jury instructions friday the judge ruled 
he would tell the panel they may not consider hazelwoods alleged 
efforts to move his ship off bligh reef reef as evidence of 
recklessness 
he said testimony has established that it was impossible for the 
ship to move anywhere after it grounded and thus there was no risk 
under the law 
but the judge said he would allow jurors to consider hazelwoods 
efforts in turning on the engines and moving the ships rudder 
after grounding as possible evidence of his impairment by alcohol 
to find hazelwood guilty of operating a vessel while 
intoxicated jurors must determine that he had a blood alcohol 
level of 10 or greater when his ship hit bligh reef shortly after 
midnight 
prosecutors have attempted through expert witnesses to calculate 
backwards and prove this but no actual blood test was taken on 
hazelwood until 10 hours after the grounding 
defense expert witnesses said such calculations are nonsense 
after six weeks of testimony hazelwood chose to remain silent 
rather than take the witness stand and discuss his role in the 
exxon valdez disaster 
his attorneys said they believed the prosecution had not proven 
its case and it was unnecessary to put the defendant on the stand

with killer bees approaching us 
borders scientists are looking for a salve for the honeybee 
industry to take the economic sting out of the invasion 
reports of swarming africanized bees attacking small children 
and large animals have beekeepers worried not so much about 
sometimes deadly bites as about the way they earn their living 
beekeepers will go out of business rather than go through 
all of this ordeal said donald oneill president of the 
louisiana beekeepers association people will not want to let 
them have locations to place their bees because people are afraid 
of the africanized bee 
much of the research under way at the us agriculture 
departments honeybee breeding genetics and physiology laboratory 
at louisiana state university is focused on protecting the gene 
pool of the domesticated european honeybee and teaching the public 
how to avoid the aggressive africanized honeybee 
bees help pollinate more than 100 crop plants in the united 
states including almonds apples watercress and white clover 
every third mouthful of food or drink you take is there 
because of honeybees said richard hellmich a research 
entomologist at the honeybee lab 
at the small lab in a pasture dotted with beehives researchers 
examine africanized bees trying to expose the secrets of genetics 
identification and behavior 
the africanized bee scientists dislike the sensational 
killer bee moniker could wing into brownsville texas this 
spring the bees have migrated 200 to 300 miles annually 
the 100 millionplus us commercial bee business is beginning 
to feel the africanized sting now 
these bees arent as bad as people make them out to be said 
bob danka a research entomologist at the honeybee lab they are 
a problem theyre more defensive and not as productive 
the difference between the european honeybee a companion of 
humans for the last 8000 years and the africanized honeybee is 
like the difference between a domestic and a wild bee 
they look the same it takes minute measurements and genetic 
tests to distinguish them 
the biggest problem in the united states will be liability 
danka said people will get stung to death by these bees 
but sensitive people also get stung to death by the gentler 
european bees hornets and yellow jackets fewer people will die 
from africanized bee stings than from lightning strikes he said 
a few to a few dozen die every year from insect stings they 
died because onehalf of 1 percent are allergic to bee stings its 
the same with africanized bees which also will kill you by 
sheer numbers danka said 
the most likely victims are small children and old people who 
cannot outrun the insects he said 
twentysix africanized queen bees exported to brazil for a 
breeding experiment were inadvertently released to breed with 
south american bees in 1957 their range extends from northern 
argentina to northern mexico 
the scientists fear public overreaction to the arrival of 
africanized bees could result in paralyzing quarantines even now 
live africanized bees are not allowed in the united states for 
study so the researchers took their work out of the country to 
places like venezuela where the bees have a stronghold 
weve seen these killer bee movies its pure science fiction 
it sells newspapers it sells magazines hellmich said but at 
the same time we cant ignore africanized bees

toyota is recalling 1984 corollas and camrys 
manufactured in 1983 and 1984 to replace cruise control computers 
but a consumer group says an investigation of later models is 
needed 
the national highway safety administration said friday it would 
study the washingtonbased center for auto safetys request for an 
investigation of camrys and corollas made between 1985 and 1988 
in a letter to the agencys office of defects investigation the 
centers samuel h cole said there had been more than 30 reports of 
accidents after the cars suddenly accelerated and more than 200 
reports of faulty cruise controls 
toyota told the agency last month it was recalling 198384 
camrys and 1984 corollas for cruise control computer replacement a 
move the center called inadequate 
toyota falls far short of recalling all affected camrys and 
corollas cole said 
toyota spokeswoman debra sanchez fair said she knew of no 
complaints about the 198588 models and declined to comment on 
whether an expanded investigation was justified 
the engine revving problem on the 1983 and 1984 models 
resulted from longterm wear she said the recall covering about 
120000 cars was ordered after two complaints were received in 
canada 
meanwhile the nhtsa said it was upgrading three investigations 
of possible automobile defects from preliminary evaluations which 
involve mostly paperwork to engineering analyses in which 
engineers study the allegedly defective parts 
each probe could end with a recall order 
the first involves chevrolet camaros manufactured between 1984 
and 1988 an estimated 819699 are on the road 
there have been 169 complaints of axle shaft problems that can 
cause loss of steering control agency spokesman tim hurd said 
consumers have blamed the problem for 132 accidents and 59 injuries 
the second engineering analysis involves electrical systems of 
plymouth voyagers and dodge caravans manufactured between 1984 and 
1989 of which 17 million are on the road there have been 86 
reports of fires under the dashboards 
the third covers 423171 ford cougars and thunderbirds from the 
1988 and 1989 model years there have been 105 complaints of 
sticking throttles which cause the cars to speed up on their own 
the problem is blamed for 10 accidents and seven injuries 
the agency also announced preliminary evaluations of 
possible underdashboard fires and parking brake failures in 
1990 chevrolet corvettes there have been no reports of either 
problem but the company has ordered dealers to replace electrical 
wiring and check parking brakes on the cars which hurd said could 
indicate a potential for fires or brake failures 
were checking to see if there are any safety implications 
hurd said 
spare tire cable breakage in general motors s10 and s15 
trucks astros and safaris from 1982 through 1989 there have been 
five complaints the probe covers 204 million vehicles 
safety belt problems in 33000 corvettes from 1986 and 1987 
there have been seven complaints

a legislator asked the governor to 
declare a state of emergency to investigate a religious group that 
directed hundreds of members in a surprise drill to prepare for 
nuclear disaster 
rep bob raney of livingston made his request to gov stan 
stephens after members of the church universal and triumphant 
entered the shelters near yellowstone national park in southwestern 
montana 
raney said friday that he called for the investigation because 
nobody who is not in this valley at this time can imagine whats 
going on no longer can anybody here gather what reality really is 
it is bizarre 
steve yeakel chief of staff to stephens said the county 
commission should investigate the group not state government 
the drill was the latest in a rush of activity by church 
universal members to prepare underground fallout shelters for 
possible occupation one shelter several miles north of 
yellowstone holds 756 people 
church spiritual leader elizabeth clare prophet has warned 
members that march and april are dangerous times and suggested 
they come to montana to make preparations for a possible nuclear 
war or accident 
our goal was to see if we could get everybody in the shelters 
at midnight thursday said church spokesman murray steinman 
steinman refused to say how many people participated but said 
the drill included a large percentage of the people who will be 
slated to inhabit the shelters in the event of a nuclear war he 
said church members did not plan to remain in the shelters members 
left the shelters friday morning 
the church has been scrutinized by its neighbors and media since 
buying the 12500acre royal teton ranch bordering yellowstone in 
1981 from the late publisher malcolm forbes 
it later expanded its holdings in park county to 30000 acres 
built two foodprocessing plants opened a printing plant in 
livingston and sponsored two housing developments for church 
members 
but the church has been selling off portions of its montana 
properties in recent months while building and stocking the fallout 
shelters 
in 1987 mrs prophet said she received a divine message that 
the nation should develop civil defense and missiledefense systems 
in anticipation of a nuclear confrontation war didnt occur by the 
predicted date of oct 2 1989 but followers say her messages are 
warnings rather than predictions

the united states sailed in stormy 
diplomatic seas after its search of two colombian ships suspected 
of carrying cocaine brought a protest from the government of 
president virgilio barco 
the government announcement came friday a week after the 
freighters taru and ciudad de zipaquira were stopped separately 
about 125 miles off its caribbean coast and searched by the us 
coast guard according to colombia 
no drugs were found aboard the ships the colombian government 
said 
the searches occurred march 9 the same day the pentagon 
announced plans to expand antidrug efforts on the high seas the 
us plans did not include a proposal to operate a flotilla off 
colombia 
the protest came two months after plans to station us warships 
off the coast to interdict drug traffickers drew criticism from 
colombian officials last month barco warned washington it would 
not let its ships be stopped and searched without prior colombian 
approval 
there was no immediate comment from officials in washington 
the foreign ministry said friday it delivered a protest note to 
the us embassy late thursday over the searching of the first 
vessel taru hours later the government said the ciudad de 
zipaquira had the same experience 
the taru carrying cement from barranquilla colombia to the 
colombian island of san andres was in an exclusive economic 
zone where according to international agreement there is freedom 
of navegation and trade assistant foreign minister clemencia 
forero told the radio network rcn 
barco told reporters at bogotas airport upon returning from 
brazil friday that he spoke there with vice president dan quayle 
about the search of the taru he gave no details 
barco and quayle attended the inauguration thursday of president 
fernando collor de mello of brazil 
colombia and the united states have worked closely in the drug 
war since colombia began a crackdown on drug traffickers in august 
including extradition of trafficking suspects to the united states 
the taru and ciudad de zipaquira were stopped well outside the 
internationally recognized territorial limit of 12 miles but 
colombia claims a 200mile limit for fishing and mineral and oil

ministers are developing a sanctuary 
network for teenagers who fear their parents will force them to 
live in the underground fallout shelters of a religious group 
preparing for nuclear armageddon 
i think it is a dangerous situation for youngsters the rev 
dick schlosser of st marys catholic church in livingston mont 
said of talk about entering underground shelters established by the 
church universal and triumphant 
adults theyre entitled to their own paranoia but i dont 
feel we have the right to do that to children 
so far at least four children of members of the church 
universal and triumphant have sought refuge from their parents 
those involved with the sanctuary network said 
a state legislator meanwhile asked gov stan stephens to 
declare a state of emergency after hundreds of church universal 
members entered shelters in a surprise drill thursday night church 
members left the shelters friday morning 
rep bob raney of livingston said he wants the governor to put 
together a task force of all state agencies and ask for 
assistance from the federal government to step in here and take a 
look at this whole activity 
a spokesman for stephens said county commissioners not state 
government should take action regarding the group 
church universal leaders have denied their flock is preparing to 
move underground and said there is no cause for alarm they said 
the shelters are for use only in the event of nuclear war or 
accident 
the sanctuary is a response to the suddenly frenzied efforts of 
the religious movement to build and stock fallout shelters for 
hundreds perhaps thousands of its members following prophecies of 
disaster from spiritual leader and church founder elizabeth clare 
prophet 
church universal spokesmen said the sanctuary movement is 
illegal and the county prosecutor said the children will be 
returned to their parents unless they have been abused 
ministers from mainline churches acknowledge potential legal 
problems but say the church always has been a place for sanctuary 
the biggest shelter which is for the church staff is a huge 
756person complex a few miles north of the park border other 
shelters are scattered throughout the paradise valley region that 
stretches north from the church compound 
mrs prophet who claims she receives and passes on to church 
members messages from a group of souls known as the ascended 
masters has warned church members that march and april would be 
dangerous times 
she told members to come to montana for a prayer vigil and to 
prepare for a possible nuclear war or accident 
livingston area businesspeople said there has been a flurry of 
activity since then church members buying survival gear food 
ammunition and medicine closing bank accounts and renting moving 
trailers and trucks 
church spokesman murray steinman said i didnt close my bank 
account im sitting in my office and doing business 
but the frenzy has caused concern in the small southwestern 
montana community home of the sanctuary movement local officials 
estimate 2000 church members live in the area or 15 percent of 
the county population 
the rev bill kliber of grace united methodist church said he 
and several other clergymen were asked last week to act as 
intermediaries between adolescents seeking refuge and foster 
families who might accept them another local pastor said he was 
offering his church as a temporary sanctuary 
steinman said the clergymens involvement smacks of a 
deliberate attempt to intervene in family life where i dont think 
these people have any business 
park county attorney nels swandal said the teenagers are 
runaway children and will be returned to their parents unless 
evidence of child abuse is found 
kliber and others said they have an eerie feeling that something 
is wrong 
for the first time im expecting something bizarre to 
happen said kliber who added that he maintains close 
relationships with some church universal members and bears them no 
ill will i have nothing to go on but a feeling in the community 
members of the cut group have come and said goodbye to people 
at banks to brokers and to accountants i dont like the idea that 
theyre going around and saying farewell that frightens me

the real estate market got hot with the 
announcement that an 8 billion atom smasher would be built in this 
town where bonnie and clyde was filmed but some greeted news 
of the final plans with boos 
we dont want our nice little town to disappear in a crowd of 
yankees and foreigners said jeanie shivers who is the deputy 
clerk for ellis county where the us department of energy decided 
to put the giant superconducting super collider project 
the doe announced thursday where the footprint of the giant 
experiment will fall finally giving residents an idea of whether 
they will have to sell their homesteads farms and ranches to the 
government 
real estate companies in waxahachie already were reporting an 
increase in business as scientists start looking for homes near the 
project 
i really am afraid of what its going to be like after the 
super collider gets here mrs shivers said i dont know if 
ill want to live here and thats talking about a family thats 
lived her for five generations 
proponents say the super collider will create 2500 permanent 
jobs 4500 temporary construction jobs and inject 370 million 
per year into the economy when completed 
texas agreed to spend up to 1 billion to lure the project 
congress just approved 225 million in the current fiscal year for 
startup costs and the bush administration is asking for 318 
million for the coming year 
at the international industrial symposium on the super collider 
friday in florida a congressman said scientists and educators 
would have to join the funding battle 
we cant build it alone said rep robert a roe dnj he 
chairs the house science space and technology committee which 
will recommend 75 billion be spent on the project 
officials say the project will mean better schools and a 
generally higher standard of living for area residents 
talk of financial growth doesnt wash with 76yearold weldon 
aday he and his wife jewell 73 inherited their homestead seven 
miles from waxahachie 
my grandfather settled here before the turn of the century and 
my father passed it on to me and i hope to pass it on to my son 
aday said but he worries about traffic jams on the twolane roads 
waxahachie a town of small buildings and 18000 residents that 
is the seat of ellis county soon will be encircled by the 54mile 
collider 
the citys economy is based largely on the regions cotton and 
sorghum crops but hollywood has discovered waxahachie too in 
addition to bonnie and clyde tender mercies places in 
the heart true stories and a trip to bountiful have 
been filmed in or near the town 
as word of the super colliders final plans circulated friday 
landowners arrived by the dozens at state land offices to find out 
their fate state officials plan to meet next week with the 670 
people who own land covered by the plan 
the gently rolling farm and ranch land generally sells for 500 
to 800 per acre said county clerk faye washington but cathy 
lynn who will lose her homestead said her neighbor sold out two 
years ago for 7000 an acre 
when the collider site was announced many people believed 
riches were on the way thats fizzled she said as they 
realized the limits of fair market value 
the gigantic atom smasher will be the worlds premier 
highenergy physics laboratory in the 54mile underground ring 
streams of protons will be hurled by powerful electromagnets at 
almost the speed of light until they collide and break into smaller 
particles 
the project is designed to expand knowledge of subatomic 
particles the building blocks of the universe

a newest us spy satellite is disintegrating in 
space and fragments are expected to plunge into the atmosphere 
within a month the novosti news agency said today 
in washington the defense department said friday only that 
hardware elements carried into orbit by the atlantis space 
shuttle would fall from the sky soon but a later us newspaper 
report said the satellite itself would plunge into the atmosphere 
novosti said soviet space tracking systems detected four 
orbiting fragments which presumably separated from the american 
spy satellite which was recently put into orbit by the atlantis 
reusable spaceship 
the satellite was launched feb 28 aboard the space shuttle 
atlantis from cape canaveral fla on a secret military mission 
that sources said included the launch of a sophisticated spy 
satellite 
novosti said scientists who analyzed the fragments orbits 
believe the objects will fall to earth possibly over northern 
regions of the soviet union between monday and april 10 
the washington post today quoted an unidentified us 
intelligence official as characterizing the malfunction as a 
serious setback 
the heat of reentry will destroy major components and prevent 
anyone from recovering supersecret equipment the newspaper quoted 
intelligence officials as saying 
a earlier defense department statement said only that the 
mission achieved its goal in association with a classified dod 
program the pentagon statement did not mention a satellite 
hardware elements are expected to reenter the earths 
atmosphere the statement said we believe there is no risk to 
life or property 
pete williams the defense department spokesman would not say 
where or when the hardware elements would plunge back toward the 
earth and what portions might be expected to survive intact 
novosti said one can only assume that the spy satellite has 
been blown up by its owners for some unknown reasons and the 
protracted silence by us space officials simply confirms the 
above suggestion 
the news agency criticized the us space agency for failing to 
notify the international community about the existence of the 
satellite and the dangers of its falling to earth 
novosti criticized nasa for not issuing information on the 
fragments or on the satellite itself although by the existing 
international rules upon the orbiting of any earth satelites the 
country which has launched it must notify other countries through 
the un of the satelllites basic characteristcs and the parameters 
of its orbit novosti said 
us sources said the satellite was a 500 million craft capable 
of taking high resolution photos and eavesdropping on electronic 
communications over much of the world 
the defense department however declined to confirm or deny 
these reports the astronauts on the mission maintained public 
airtoground silence during the flight in contrast with civilian 
shuttle crews whose every remark is played over a public radio 
circuit 
space debris reenters the earths atmosphere from time to time 
with most of it burning up from the heat of reentry 
since 70 percent of the earths surface is ocean what does make 
it to the ground has a good chance of falling harmlessly into the 
ocean 
two examples are the solar maximum scientific observatory which 
fell into the indian ocean last dec 2 and the cosmos 1402 soviet 
satellite which came down in two parts a 110pound nuclear 
reactor into the south atlantic in february 1983 and the fourton 
main body of the spacecraft into the indian ocean the previous 
month 
pieces of the us skylab satellite came down in the wilderness 
of western australia in 1981 and debris and radioactivity from an 
earlier soviet cosmos satellite fell in the canadian wilderness in 
1978

has asked the security council to quadruple a un force to be sent 
to nicaragua to disarm contra rebels and protect those awaiting 
resettlement 
the proposal friday would increase the number of troops from 260 
to about 1060 and would expand the missions purpose which 
currently involves only verifying the cutoff of contra aid and 
patrolling borders to prevent guerrilla attacks 
perez de cuellar said nicaraguas outgoing sandinista government 
and the incoming administration of presidentelect violeta barrios 
de chamorro have stressed the importance of voluntary 
demobilization of the contras in the transfer of power in nicaragua 
if as i fervently hope it proves possible for all the 
parties concerned to reach early agreement on a plan based on the 
modalities described in this report the united nations will have 
to move quickly to deploy the additional personnel and material 
resources he said 
contra leaders however have said they will not lay down their 
arms until the sandinistas relinquish power over the military 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has said the contras must lay 
down their arms before his party turns over the military to mrs 
chamorro who takes office april 25 
a us government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said friday that hundreds of armed contras in honduras have defied 
calls for their demobilization and have reinfiltrated nicaragua 
swelling the ranks from 3500 to 5000 the rebels are receiving 
us nonlethal aid 
thomas pickering us permanent representative to the united 
nations said all nations speaking during the security council 
session agreed in principle to expand the mandate of the un 
observer group in central america 
the 15member council plans to vote next week on the 
secretarygenerals proposal to expand the un mission 
under perez de cuellars proposal the observer force would 
collect weapons ammunition military equipment and uniforms from 
the rebels 
contras who are in honduras at the time of demobilization would 
hand over their weapons at camps there and await repatriation or 
resettlement elsewhere under international supervision 
for rebels still in nicaragua the observer force would 
establish temporary assembly points there and in border areas of 
costa rica according to the un chiefs proposal the contras 
would be told to gather at the nearest assembly point where the 
peacekeepers plan to take control of weapons and military supplies 
the un chief stressed the demobilization process must be 
voluntarily accepted by the contras and said it should be possible 
to complete the process in a period of four to six weeks

only 28 doctors provide primary health services 
for the 17 million people who live in the citys poorest 
neighborhoods a study reported 
the report released friday by the community service society of 
new york said said that the patienttodoctor ratio represents a 
shortage of about 500 doctors based on the national average of 
basic care by americans 
the additional 500 doctors would be needed in order for each 
resident in the nine communities to make 36 primary care visits a 
year the national average 
the study found that there are in fact 701 physicians in the 
surveyed neighborhoods but discovered that only 28 of them are 
available to the majority of residents and able to offer their 
patients the minimum elements of primary care 
nancy f mckenzie director of the css health unit told a city 
council hearing friday that more doctors is not the answer 
in fact there is an oversupply mckenzie said we are 
speaking most urgently about realigning the system of health care 
delivery 
in analyzing the findings the report said the picture painted 
here is frightening the poor health status of people in lowincome 
communities is exacerbated by the significant shortage of primary 
care providers in these areas 
the study also found 
almost none of the 900 people who graduate annually from new 
york medical schools practice in lowincome communities 
only a few minority students those most likely to practice in 
highneed areas are accepted at state schools 
those who do tend to the poor find the costs almost 
prohibitive medicaid rates are only 11 a visit and many patients 
have no medical insurance 
the report building primary health care in new york citys 
lowincome communities called for increasing medicaid payments 
and starting a state authority to finance primary care in poor 
areas

cuban president fidel castro says his 
threedecadeold communist revolution doesnt need to be tested 
with a popular vote and expressed repugnance with the us 
electoral system 
despite democratic reforms in eastern europe and latin america 
the hardline communist leader told a twohour news conference 
friday that he plans no changes 
you dont play with the revolution castro told reporters 
when asked if he would win a direct election with other candidates 
it would be foolishness to have a test only to prove wrong those 
who say cuba holds fradulent elections 
our system isnt direct its indirect but in my judgment 
very democratic said castro who has ruled cuba since a 1959 
revolution 
he said he felt repugnance for the electoral system in the 
united states which he called a parody 
his comments appeared to be his answer to vice president dan 
quayle who on thursday asked anyone who is in contact with 
castro to ask him when hes going to have elections 
quayle castro and other regional leaders on thursday attended 
the inauguration of fernando collor de mello brazils first 
popularly elected president in 29 years 
congresses of the ruling communist party choose cubas 
leadership on thursday cubas official prensa latina announced 
that the first party congress in four years would be held in the 
first half of 1991 
castro said he was secure in his leadership 
how would it be possible to sustain the revolution faced for 
30 years with a blockade from the united states if it didnt have 
support he said 
when asked about recent critical articles on him in the soviet 
union and his decision to censor circulation of soviet magazines in 
cuba castro responded 
we made the error of deifying everything that was coming from 
there and now the poison arrives the revolutionary cant be 
an idiot nor a fool and should have means of defense 
he said latin america must move closer or we will be forever 
colonies 
castro also dismissed as an exaggeration news reports that 
brazilian authorities stopped his bodyguards from bringing in a 
huge cache of weapons for his security 
there were two or three bazookas and a machine gun maybe it 
was excessive diligence for my care he said 
in the afternoon during a surprise visit to the national 
conference of brazilian bishops castro said the roman catholic 
church in cuba should dedicate itself to the people instead of 
assuming an antirevolutionary position 
castro told the reporters that in last month or so the cuban 
church has been giving signals that it would prefer to 
collaborate with the north american church and sectors following 
the changes in eastern europe castro said those sectors spread 
the illusion that his government will not rule much longer 
according to castro a visit to cuba by pope john paul ii is 
practically agreed upon 
castro will visit sao paulo and rio de janeiro before leaving 
monday

long lines formed around banks and 
opposition lawmakers called for an emergency session of congress 
after president fernando collor de mello announced a tough 
antiinflation plan 
brazilians want serious action now said collor who 
unveiled the plan friday a day after taking office as brazils 
first popularly elected leader in 29 years 
the austerity measures include price controls a new currency 
jail terms for financial and price speculators and a freeze on 
bank savings accounts 
higher taxes and utility costs a severe tightening of the money 
supply cuts in government subsidies and tax incentives were part 
of the plan to halt 2700 percent inflation 
government officials on friday night increased fuel prices 56 
percent telephone rates 32 percent postal costs 80 percent 
electricity 32 percent and air fares 50 percent 
im pretty confused by all this said wilmar moreira 34 a 
sao paulo taxi driver but im still rooting for collor what 
else can i do 
in rio the third day of an enforced bank holiday further slowed 
business activity friday blocklong lines continued to form 
throughout the night as residents tried to get the maximum 47 cash 
withdrawal to get them through the weekend banks were to open 
monday 
the measures are hard but if they are not adopted 
hyperinflation will set in at extreme social costs economy 
minister zelia cardoso de mello said in a nationally televised 
interview friday night 
ms cardoso de mello said salaries this month will be adjusted 
to last months inflation rate which was 73 percent wages and 
prices in future months would be adjusted by an amount set by the 
government 
but she failed to provide details about workers salaries new 
tax rates and the number of workers to be cut from the government 
payroll 
the package drew fire from some economists labor leaders and 
leftwing politicians 
whats going to happen to workers salaries theyre not going 
up as fast as these utility hikes said respected sao paulo 
economist joao paulo malgalhaes social instability is a very 
real danger 
leaders of the centerleft brazilian social democracy party the 
socialist workers party and the democratic labor party pushed for 
an emergency weekend session of congress to review the plan 
most of the economic reforms were sent to congress as 
provisional measures which take effect immediately but can be 
voted within 30 days they also become null if congress fails to 
call a vote within the same period 
the economy will come to a halt and i have no doubt 
unemployment will shoot up said jair meneguelli president of 
the radical leftist central workers union once again the 
working man will pay for this package 
initial reactions from businessmen and conservative politicians 
were mixed 
collor also said the 14monthold new cruzado would be replaced 
by the cruzeiro the fourth currency in the last four years and 
seventh in the countrys history 
the cruzeiro will be equal to one new cruzado valued at about

abortion on demand would be illegal in this 
us territory if gov joseph ada fails to veto a bill passed 
unanimously by the 21member legislature 
supporters of legalized abortion have started a campaign to 
pressure ada to cast a veto while abortion opponents applauded the 
legislation 
clearly the people of guam dont want abortion on demand and 
have made a clear statement on this said nancy myers the 
national right to life committees director of communications in 
washington 
ada can veto the most restrictive abortion legislation in the 
united states or sign it into law if he does neither by midnight 
tuesday it will become law automatically 
under the bill abortion would be allowed only if a pregnancy 
endangers a womans health two independent doctors would have to 
give their approval and their decision would have to be reviewed by 
a committee appointed by the guam medical licensure board 
the bill was amended before approval to provide for a referendum 
on the issue in november 
janet benshoof director of the reproductive freedom project of 
the american civil liberties union was to arrive here sunday to 
lobby against the bill 
our position is that the bill is patently unconstitutional 
rachael pine staff attorney for the project said in new york 
if the bill becomes law we expect that it would be struck down 
in the lower courts 
the aclu is concerned that the measure could threaten the 
landmark 1973 roe vs wade decision which legalized abortion 
guam seems far away and only a territory but passage of this 
law could take roe versus wade away from women all over the 
nation 
the legislature approved the bill march 8 after archbishop 
anthony apuron threatened to excommunicate any of its 20 roman 
catholic lawmakers who might vote against it however not all of 
the legislators were aware of the threat before the vote was taken 
myers said her group does not plan to send anyone to guam to 
lobby ada to sign the bill 
the people of guam have spoken and we are not going to try to 
foist anything on them like the aclu is doing she said 
ada who is also roman catholic has said the bill will have to 
be thoroughly studied by legal experts before he makes a decision 
his deputy chief of staff mark forbes said the bill is a bit 
more severe than the governors personal view

procedures 
in chattanooga two sniper attacks in as many days left some

ill sit in the middle not in the front and not in the back 
in the middle ms smith said as she waited for a bus that would 
take her through nashville to huntsville ala 
and ill sit kind of low too

the local attacks

feeling but after this one last night then it makes you angry

are trying to win the strike through violence and intimidation

human rights groups are 
condemning a proposed amnesty for up to 2000 former soldiers 
jailed for common or politically motivated crimes 
amnesty international said the measure if passed by the 
legislature could free the killers of four us churchwomen in 
december 1980 as well as those responsible for several massacres 
a report friday by the londonbased human rights group called the 
proposal too broad 
lilian alvarado a member of the committee of mothers of 
prisoners disappeared and murdered for political reasons said 
passage of the bill would be a mockery of the fragile judicial 
system and would provoke even more abuses by military men 
rightwing paramilitary squads have been blamed for thousands of 
killings of civilians in el salvadors decadeold civil war 
a group calling itself the committee of prisoners of exmembers 
of the armed forces presented a petition for amnesty to a 
legislative committee dec 8 but the proposal was not made public 
until this week 
mario amaya president of the committee said at least several 
weeks of study were needed on the bill 
it has the support of rightist ricardo alvarenga president of 
the legislature 
we want peace we want tranquility if for whatever reason 
these people find themselves in this situation i think we could 
give them the opportunity to reincorporate themselves into 
society he said 
the petition for amnesty was signed by 80 former members of the 
armed forces either serving sentences or awaiting trial for a wide 
range of felonies the vast majority of them common crimes 
under salvadoran law a soldier convicted of a felony is 
automatically dismissed from the armed forces 
the exsoldiers argued in their petition that an amnesty granted 
in october 1987 benefited leftist rebels exclusively 
about 200 political prisoners were freed under that measure as 
were about the same number of former military men about 2000 
soldiers remain in prison 
in its report amnesty international argued the earlier amnesty 
helped military veterans more than its did leftist guerrillas 
it said guerrillas had only 15 days to turn themselves in and 
receive amnesty while the military who had not even been accused 
of any crime were absolved in the unlikely event they might be 
prosecuted sometime in the future 
the christian democratic party which handed power last year to 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance following elections 
has also come out against the proposal for a new amnesty

president roh taewoo today replaced 
15 cabinet members including his senior economic aide in an 
attempt to revive the countrys sluggish economy 
among the changes roh replaced deputy premier and economic 
planning minister cho soon who has been criticized for policies 
that caused high inflation land speculation and slow exports 
in his place roh named lee seungyun a former finance minister 
under the administration of former president chun doohwan 
government officials say lee is likely to lower interest rates and 
provide more financial incentives to stimulate exports which fell 
25 percent in the first two months of the year 
the problems we face now are complex and need time to be 
solved but i think priority must be directed at encouraging 
investment and stimulating exports lee told reporters 
the cabinet changes had been anticipated after last months 
merger of rohs governing party with two centrist opposition 
groups the new conservative party gave the president a comfortable 
parliamentary majority 
the change followed the resignation friday of prime minister 
kang younghoon and his entire 22member cabinet 
roh retained the prime minister defense chief and foreign 
minister but changed 15 of the cabinet posts including most of 
those involving the economy chief presidential spokesman lee 
soojung said 
the changes reflected rohs determination to revive the sagging 
economy chief presidential spokesman lee soojung said the 
spokesman said it was also aimed at invigorating national politics 
as roh enters the second half of his fiveyear term which ends in 
early 1993 
ahn ungmo a deputy director of the agency for national 
security planning the governments main intelligence body was 
named the new home minister the home minister controls the 
countrys 130000member national police force 
park pilsoo a former government economic official became the 
minister of trade and industry and chung youngui 53 chief of the 
securities supervisory agency was appointed as the finance 
minister 
the reorganization affected the presidential staff including 
rohs chief secretary hong sungchul who was named to head the

on the day honoring irelands patron saint st patrick a green 
line on new york citys streets showed the way for 125000 parade 
marchers and an old irish club in springfield mass prepared to 
elect its first female president 
the 229th st patricks day parade steps up manhattans fifth 
avenue today police expected 2 million spectators 
while the parade will lack the political fireworks of past 
years it included some controversy irish republican army soldier 
joseph doherty was spending his seventh st patricks day in the 
metropolitan correctional center and his supporters were expected 
to call for his release 
at the 253yearold charitable irish society in springfield 
mass members tonight were to inaugurate catherine b shannon as 
president 
i think they feel its about time said william connaughton 
a former president of the bostonbased society which began 
admitting women in the early 1980s 
i think that what happened was there were a lot of men who 
were coming onto the board who were in their 40s and 50s who said 
this is ridiculous stag dinners are not that much fun said 
shannon a westfield state college professor her field of study is 
irish history but she also has researched the role of women in 
modern ireland 
in boston on friday officials dedicated a spot in quincy market 
for a statue of a mother and child to memorialize irish famine 
victims and to serve as a reminder of the worlds hunger crisis 
rather than locate a memorial to such a great human tragedy in 
some forgotten corner i felt it was important that it be placed in 
a location where people who live in boston and who visit here would 
perhaps stop and think and be reminded of what hunger and 
oppression mean to a people mayor raymond flynn said 
the 12foot statue will be the first american memorial to those 
who died during the irish famine flynn said

congress today said it will meet with south african president fw 
de klerk to discuss the political future of that the country 
the guerrillabacked organization made its stand clear as 
lusaka the zambian capital prepared for three days of highlevel 
diplomatic initiatives towards a change in the balance of political 
power in south africa 
anc spokesman tom sebina said in an interview that nothing would 
stand in the way of the scheduled preliminary discussions april 11 
in south africa between the whiteled government and the anc 
sebinas comments came a day after de klerk announced nelson 
mandela and other anc leaders were invited to the talks as a step 
towards formal powersharing negotiations 
lusaka has been the headquarters of the anc the biggest 
movement in conflict with the pretoria government since it was 
outlawed 30 years ago

for antigovernment activities and legalized the anc and other 
groups mandela 71 returned home to south africa today to prepare 
for the talks after a visit to sweden 
de klerk said he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will 
bring the voteless black majority of 28 million into the national 
government but he also wants the 5 million whites to wield veto 
power over major policy decisions 
in lusaka the anc spokesman said its delegation would include 
leaders based both inside and outside south africa 
the aim of the preliminary negotiations sebina said was to 
discuss the removal of obstacles in the path of formal talks on the 
political future of the country 
the anc seeks the end of the 3yearold state of emergency the 
release of all other political prisoners and the withdrawal of army 
troops from black townships as preconditions for formal discussions 
sebina said the april 11 talks would be between only the 
government and the anc he maintained other antiapartheid would 
not be included 
once the preliminary stage has been passed he said the anc 
has always maintained that the process of negotiations will be 
democratic in itself 
if other antiapartheid organizations want to present their 
positions on a democratic future south africa they are welcome to 
join us around the negotiating table he added 
previously pretoria has said other leaders including those of 
the 10 black homelands would be at talks 
one of these zulu political leader mangosuthu buthelezi spent 
his second day in lusaka today at the invitation of president

many of the 7 million zulus of the kwazulu homeland in eastern 
south africa opposes anc violence and the movements calls for 
international sanctions against their country 
about 3000 people have been killed in violence between zulus 
the biggest black tribe and the anc since 1986 
after arriving friday night buthelezi told kaunda that while he 
differed with mandela on some issues he held the anc leader in 
high regards 
buthelezi arrived at a time when zambia was geared up for other 
diplomatic initiatives on south africa angola botswana

the warsaw pact met today on the 
eve of east germanys elections to discuss german unification its 
impact on europe and the two military blocs that have divided the 
continent for more than 40 years 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and his six 
colleagues opened the days brainstorming session by meeting with 
president vaclav havel a leading advocate of the eventual 
dissolution of nato and the warsaw pact 
the official news agency ctk said havel presented unspecified 
proposals concerning proposed german unity and the future of a 
united europe and that these were exceptionally well received 
by the foreign ministers 
the ministers then went into a closeddoor meeting at a 
luxurious former communist party hotel 
since a peaceful revolution overturned the communist monopoly on 
power in czechoslovakia in december havel and his foreign 
minister jiri dienstbier have swiftly moved to center stage in 
eastwest politics visiting european capitals and the superpowers 
to preach the ideas of a blocfree europe that arise from 
philosophies they developed as dissidents 
after receiving the ministers havel flew off to the mountains 
on the polish border for a meeting with solidarity leader lech 
walesa only a year ago such meetings between czechoslovak and 
polish dissidents were conducted in secret and almost always 
watched or broken up by police 
todays warsaw pact gathering came on the eve of east germanys 
first free elections since adolf hitler took power in germany in 
1933 and two days after havel and west german president richard 
von weizsaecker met in prague on the 51st anniversary of hitlers 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
that meeting served as a further gesture of reconciliation 
between prague and the two germanys following havels visit his 
first trip abroad as president to east berlin and munich in 
january 
while czechoslovakia and hungary have stressed they do not 
oppose german unification both countries have strongly advocated 
that poland be included in the twoplusfour talks on german 
unification and that west germany should respect polands current 
borders the talks involve the two germanys and the four world war 
ii allies the united states the soviets britain and france 
the history of all the states in the warsaw pact is deeply 
intertwined with germanys centurieslong evolution from a series 
of small principalities and dukedoms into a strong empire then a 
nazi dictatorship and now the potential 80millionstrong 
superpower of europe 
polish memories of the countrys suffering at the hands of the 
germans in world war ii have prompted warsaw to demand a say in the 
process of german unification and made polands solidarityled 
government reluctant to follow czechoslovakia and hungary into 
negotiating a withdrawal of soviet troops 
czechoslovaks too remember their nazi occupation with 
bitterness while germans recall the postworld war ii expulsion of 
almost 3 million germans from the sudeten territories along 
czechoslovakias current northwestern western and southern borders

has assured voters that east germanys first free elections will be 
fraudproof seeking to allay distrust in a country accustomed to 
communist voterigging 
also today a west german newspaper said the east berlin 
government is seeking an immediate bailout to prevent economic 
collapse 
east germany urgently needs 5 billion marks 294 billion to 
provide for the population and prevent economic collapse the 
berliner morgenpost said it said the caretaker government had 
given a position paper to west germany detailing its needs 
most campaigning ended friday but a few political parties 
planned final pitches today the eve of balloting that will give 
east germany its first freely elected parliament since its founding 
in 1949 and complete the transition from communist rule 
sundays vote is for a new 400seat parliament which could 
decide the pace of unification with west germany 
some conservative parties urge quick unification some leftist 
groups are for a more cautious and slower approach all major 
parties support unification 
an estimated 123 million voters are eligible to choose from 
among 24 parties and groupings election helpers completed work on 
the 22000 polling stations nationwide 
the communists are expected to end up in an opposition role 
party chief gregor gysi wound up their campaign with a rally 
before thousands of people in east berlin he called for a united 
germany to remain outside the western military alliance echoing 
moscows stand and recalled the social safety net set up under 
communist rule 
petra blaess head of an allparty election oversight 
commission told a news conference all measures have been taking to 
ensure against vote fraud 
in the berlin computer center there are no possibilities for 
manipulation in the transmitting and compiling of the results from 
the voting districts said blaess a 25yearold student 
three members of the european parliament in strasbourg france 
will also act as election observers 
the delegations leader danish parliamentarian kirsten jensen

local elections in may is considered a main factor in the autumn 
uprising that toppled hardline communist leader erich honecker 
opened the berlin wall and launched the reform process

for youth research and the institute for market research both from

democrats and the alliance for germany a coalition of three 
conservative parties 
those two forces mirror the mainstream parties in west germany 
the christian democrats of chancellor helmut kohl and the social 
democrats who include the hugely popular former chancellor willy 
brandt 
the west german parties poured heavy campaign support into east 
germany they are using the vote as a prelude for west german 
elections in december and to build up power bases in the east 
before expected unification 
balloting in east germany was originally scheduled for may but 
with state authority collapsing rapidly the date was moved up

lithuanias president today renewed his call for 
negotiations with the kremlin on independence while nationalists 
in the fellow baltic republics of estonia and latvia prepared for 
parliamentary elections sunday 
lithuanias legislature elected former president algirdas 
brazauskas to the post of deputy premier and named former communist 
kazimira prunskene who quit the party to the post of premier 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a telegram on friday 
demanded that lithuania return to the soviet fold within three 
days he declined to say what the kremlin would do if lithuania 
refused but he and his aides have ruled out the use of force the 
republic declared its independence sunday 
the cable sent by president gorbachev and addressed to the 
lithuanian supreme soviet sounds very much like pressure being 
applied on us lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis told his 
republics supreme council 
but landsbergis said we remember gorbachevs words about a 
dialgoue with lithuania and the cable could be interpreted as a 
beginning of the negotiating process 
he was quoted by eduardas patashinskas a lithuanian television 
editor who attended the session 
the soviet parliament issued a proclamation on thursday saying 
that lithuanias declaration was invalid 
landsbergis accused the parliament of treating lithuania like 
a naughty girl and said the independent supreme council would 
continue its work while waiting for the kremlin to respond to its 
calls for negotiations 
as for gorbachevs cable he said it can only be remarked 
that it was sent to the wrong address because we are no longer the 
supreme soviet of the lithuanian soviet socialist republic 
when the republic declared its independence on sunday lawmakers 
changed its name to the republic of lithuania and renamed their 
legislature the supreme council 
as lithuania grappled with its newly declared independence 
estonia and latvia prepared for supreme soviet elections sunday a 
strong proindependence vote was expected 
a proindependence rally in the latvian capital riga this 
afternoon was peaceful and orderly said a spokesman for the 
grassroots peoples front 
in the estonian capital tallinn a proindependence rally was 
held by several hundred nationalists on the eve of elections it 
was calm said popular front spokesman michael tarm 
in elections held in december proindependence movements in the

signal that they could take a large number of parliamentary seats 
in sundays vote

tens of thousands of people marched through 
baghdad and surrounded the british embassy today to protest 
britains outcry over iraqs execution of a londonbased journalist 
they shouted chants and carried placards praising the hanging 
thursday of farzad bazoft 31 who was arrested while researching 
an article on a military complex and convicted in a closed trial of 
spying for britain and israel 
officials of the ruling baath socialist party which organized 
the rally estimated 100000 people turned out state tv reported 
antibritish demonstrations in other cities 
there were no reports of violence 
the sprawling walled embassy compound on the western bank of 
the tigris river was ringed by police officers and plainclothes 
security agents they blocked the main entrance to the compound 
with their cars no embassy personnel could be seen 
president saddam husseins party called for nationwide 
demonstrations after britain denounced bazofts execution as 
barbaric recalled ambassador harold walker expelled six iraqi 
military trainees and halted all visits to baghdad by government 
officials 
however prime minister margaret thatchers government resisted 
demands to sever relations and impose economic sanctions on iraq 
with which britain has a nearly 500 million trade surplus 
western nations and human rights groups also denounced the 
execution but arab newspapers and jordans king hussein today 
defended it 
we hope that the numerous efforts which we see that aim at 
mistreating iraq not just in this case but in others will ease 
the king said there has been a concentrated attack on iraq for a 
long period of time without any reason to justify it 
qatars alsharq echoing other publications in the persian gulf 
region said there is no excuse for this campaign which is but 
an attempt not only to undermine iraq but the rest of the arab 
states in international forums 
residents in basra in southern iraq and mosul in the north 
contacted by telephone reported thousands of demonstrators were in 
the streets chanting antibritish slogans 
like the thousands who jammed baghdads main thoroughfares 
marchers in basra and mosul chanted slogans hailing hussein who 
ignored international appeals for clemency for bazoft 
the demonstrators chanted that british talk is nonsense 
your spy has already been hanged 
sadi mehdi saleh the parliament speaker and baath party chief 
in the capital told the associated press the demonstration was 
designed to show britain that iraqis were united behind hussein and 
his decision to enforce the court verdict 
bazoft an iranianborn reporter for the weekly the observer who 
traveled on british documents was arrested in september while he 
was investigating reports of a major explosion at a secret iraqi 
military research complex south of baghdad 
the iraqis accused bazoft of spying for britain and israel and 
he was sentenced to death by a closeddoor security court earlier 
this month a british nurse who drove him to the complex daphne 
parish 53 was sentenced to 15 years in prison 
bazoft made a public confession on iraqi tv but later retracted 
it and denied he was engaged in espionage 
his colleagues say he was working only as a reporter

a car ran off a back road and plunged into 
a rainswollen creek where a bridge had washed out killing the six 
people aboard authorities said today 
the driver apparently did not realize the bridge on the county 
road between florala and samson was gone and drove into the creek 
between 1030 pm and 11 pm friday said coroner norman hobson 
there was a small barrier there but nobody knows whether it 
was put up before or after the wreck he said 
hobson identified the dead as a man and wife their 14yearold 
child and three other people who apparently were not related he 
declined to release the victims names pending notification of 
relatives 
the six had left south carolina earlier friday for their homes 
near florala about 100 miles due south of montgomery near the 
florida state line he said 
undoubtedly they didnt realize how bad the weather was 
hobson said 
a man who lives near the bridge saw the cars rear lights 
sticking out of the water and notified police 
thunderstorms that began thursday had dumped up to a foot of 
rain in southern alabama washing out roads and bridges and causing 
flooding in lowlying areas

blackouts have been on the increase lately in a 
tough rundown neighborhood on havanas east side 
and to some that could be a political omen with the blackout 
of communism in eastern europe now virtually complete is cuba next 
for his part president fidl castro is convinced that communism 
is here to stay he confidently asserts that those who think 
otherwise have always underestimated cuban resolve 
but even stalwart admirers of the revolution admit the country 
faces greater uncertainty now than at any time in years cuba is 
suffering from ideological and political isolation the economy has 
been in decline for years and there are doubts about cubas 
relations with its chief benefector the soviet union 
nonetheless castro is still able to claim the allegience of 
millions of his countrymen his support level is substantial at 
least when compared with that of eastern europes former 
leadership which passed into history last year seemingly unmourned 
by their subjects 
still most cubans agree that backing for the revolution has 
waned since the heady early days hardships abound here buyying 
food or getting to work or making a phone call can be major 
undertakings everything is scarce except grumbling or so it seems 
the number of cubans fleeing for miami on boats has been 
averaging 40 a month a sharp increase people can subsist but 
not live says jorge luis pichardo 26 who fled cuba last august 
for florida on a raft 
but castro to many remains the embodiment of cuban 
nationalism the leader who brought justice and dignity to a 
country which once had little of either castros mystique is such 
that anyone who judges his support based on cubas economic 
indicators is using the wrong approach 
many cubans feel castro has rescued them from certain oblivion 
juan aizpura rodriguez was a 15year old grade school dropout with 
little hope at the time of the revolution 
he now boasts a college degree and a prestige job as a member of 
the national directorate of one of cubas mass organizations 
if it werent for the revolution the masses would be 
suffering aizpura says 
and as the cuban media constantly points out the socialist 
regimes in eastern europe were tainted from the start having been 
imposed by moscow after world war ii in contrast the view here is 
that the cuban revolution is legitimate because it was home grown 
castros message these days is that those who look on the 
revolution as a house of cards vulnerable to the slightest 
breeze are dead wrong 
there was some evidence to support that thesis last tuesday 
evening when about 50000 students gathered in front of the 
presidential palace to commemorate a revolutionary 
anniversaryattendance at such events is prudent in a country where 
people especially students often are judged by their 
revolutionary zeal 
but the enthusiasm written on the faces and heard in the 
patriotic chants as castro spoke seemed genuine even after three 
decades castro has not lost his ability to hypnotyze audiences 
castro is not one to retreat in the face of adversity rather 
than copy the reforms now common in eastern europe castro has 
become more assertive than ever in his defense of socialism 
for decades he ended his speeches with fatherland or 
death now there is a supplement socialism or death 
but castros speeches suggest a strong sense that the unexpected 
may happen that the government has to be increasingly 
vigilanthuman rights activists who once had some room to manuever 
now find themselves the targets of mass protests most of the rest 
are either in jail or intimidated 
how many support the activists how many would welcome a change 
in the system given the closed nature of cuban society those 
questions may be unanswerable 
the revolutions future may well be decided by forces beyond 
cubas control 
the soviet union has been an extraordinarily reliable patron for 
cuba for years contributing an average of 5 billion annually in 
economic help a recent izvestia article said the cubas debt to 
the soviets was 247 billion 
add the estimated 7 billion owed to western banks and cuba 
emerges as one of the most heavily indebted countries per capita a 
nation whose ambtious social welfare program has been built largely 
with borrowed money 
if the widely predicted scaling down of soviet help to cuba is 
carried out and living standards decline diplomats wonder whether 
castros charisma will be enough to placate his countrymen 
but foreign ministry officials say sovietcuban relations are as 
strong as ever despite the revisionist policies of president 
mikhail gorbachev and that moscow has promised to continue abiding 
by its economic commitments 
castro though is taking no chances warning that extreme belt 
tightening measures may be required if moscow is forced to cut back

less than a year after namibia was 
ablaze with a war and wracked by seemingly insurmountable ethnic 
differences the territory is ready for a peaceful transition to 
independence from south africa this week 
the diverse people of this vast arid land have set aside their 
weapons and begun working together to transform africas last 
colony into one of the continents few democracies independence 
officially begins wednesday 
we confounded the doubters said sam nujoma the territorys 
designated president who led the southwest africa peoples 
organization during its 23year guerrilla war against south african 
rule 
black nationalist guerrillas and rightwing whites who once 
fought each other have been preaching reconciliation in what has 
been a remarkably smooth approach to independence for namibia 
formerly known as southwest africa 
we have accepted that southwest africa as we knew it will be 
replaced by an independent namibia said jan de wet leader of 
the rightwing national party we are glad to offer our skills 
and resources to this country if we are welcome 
swapo often was depicted by whites as a marxistterrorist 
organization during the war but since winning unsupervised 
elections in november the leftist organization has made numerous 
compromises in an attempt to accommodate the 11 distinct ethnic 
groups that make up namibias 13 million people 
swapos support comes predominantly from the northern ovambo 
tribe but nujoma also has named blacks who are not ovambos to key 
positions to allay fears that swapo will be a tribalbased 
government he also has appointed whites and businessmen from 
opposition parties to his cabinet 
the future government wants to ensure that policies and 
laws will be supported by the widest possible crosssection of the 
population said otto herrigel a germandescended namibian who 
will serve as nujomas finance secretary 
opposition groups also have been in a conciliatory mood 
seven parties won seats in the elections and they have sharp 
ideological differences but within weeks the 72member 
constitutional assembly unanimously agreed on a democratic 
constitution that guarantees fundamental rights and regular 
elections it also limits the president to two fiveyear terms 
rare on a continent where most leaders serve for life 
swapo which was committed to socialism while in exile now 
speaks more often of working with the white business community that 
controls the mining farming and fishing industries 
those industries along with south african aid have made 
namibia one of the few african countries to achieve an annual per 
capita income of 1000 
however the wealth is in the hands of the 75000 whites who 
make up only 6 percent of the population 
meeting black expectations without alienating whites will be one 
of the biggest challenges facing the government 
there have been no signs of a mass exodus by whites who easily 
could go to whiteruled south africa as thousands did when the 
united nations announced namibias independence plan in 1978 
the un plan sat on the shelf for a decade as south africa 
refused to relinquish control of the territory which it captured 
from germany during world war i 
but in december 1988 south africa agreed to grant independence 
to namibia under a regional peace treaty 
at the ceremony when the new namibian constitution was adopted 
in november several speakers said south africa should take 
inspiration from namibias harmonious independence process 
many south africans were relieved at the westernstyle 
democratic constitution adopted by a constituent assembly in 
namibia but others said they would withhold judgment since 
neighboring zimbabwe also began its black majority rule with a 
democracy and britishinspired constitution zimbabwe president 
robert mugabe is now in the process of turning the government into 
a oneparty state 
the longdelayed independence plan in namibia almost collapsed 
the day it began last april 1 
hundreds of swapo guerrillas crossed into northern namibia in 
violation of the un plan igniting three weeks of fighting more 
than 300 guerrillas died and 27 members of the south africanled 
security forces were killed 
since peace was restored there has been sporadic violence in 
september anton lubowski swapos highestranking white member 
was assassinated 
but there have been no widescale outbreaks of violence and the 
more than 6000 un civilian and military personnel in namibia are 
scheduled to leave in early april that will end the 450 million 
un operation the most extensive ever conducted by the united 
nations

it was supposed to be a trip mostly about 
panama but when vice president dan quayle came home from a week in 
south america scarcely a word about panama had been uttered 
instead the vice president found himself drawn into what one of 
his aides dubbed a rolling summit on nicaragua as he and 
regional leaders crisscrossed the continent to attend presidential 
inaugurations in chile and brazil 
panama is behind us and now we are talking about the future 
quayle told reporters he acknowledged he had expected to run into 
heads of state still seething about president bushs december 
invasion that they saw as a violation of panamas sovereignty 
but the latin leaders he contended have a new thinking of 
pragmatism that doesnt let such matters get in the way of their 
pressing agenda for peace and economic stability 
following the removal of us invasion troops from panama and 
with an election pending on constitutional changes there almost 
all of the latin countries have restored relations with the 
usinstalled government or are in the process of doing so 
as quayle arrived in south america the regions leaders were 
focusing on more pressing matters including their own 
inflationridden economies and trying to get nicaragua back on 
peaceful footing under a new elected government 
as it turned out quayle ended up being the first highlevel 
official of the bush administration to break the us freezeout 
against nicaraguas president daniel ortega meeting with quayle in 
both chile and brazil the nicaraguan promised he would peacefully 
transfer power to violeta chamorro in april 
the ortega encounter was not part of the plans when president 
bush sent quayle to mend fences over panama 
it was a case of being in the right place at the right time 
explained one administration official saying the trip had been far 
more substantive than anticipated 
it raised quayles profile internationally and showed he was 
capable of turning what could have been routine protocol 
appearances into significant diplomacy 
in fact president bush invited secretary of state james a baker 
iii and deputy national security adviser robert gates to join him 
and quayle for lunch friday so quayle could give a full accounting 
of the trip 
we think that prospects for a resolution of the imbroglio in 
nicaragua are better than they were a week ago at least in part 
because of quayles discussions during his trip quayles press 
secretary david beckwith said 
sen edward kennedy who was part of the us delegation to the 
chilean inaugural wrote a letter to bush thanking him for naming 
the massachusetts democrat to the delegation and adding that quayle 
performed extremely well as head of our delegation and was a 
great credit to our country and your administration 
kennedy told a reporter during the trip that quayle was 
knowledgeable and held his own in discussions with important 
regional leaders 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said our assessment is 
that the trip was quite successful for one thing the vice 
president was met with broad acceptance and cheers throughout the 
hemisphere it demonstrated a high degree of support for the 
united states and some very good feelings toward the united states 
in latin america 
after four trips to the region since becoming vice president 
quayle places great stock in being on a firstname basis with 
almost all the presidents in the region he feels he has a firm 
grasp of the issues of importance in a region that historically has 
often felt slighted by the united states 
officials traveling with quayle said he was able to interject 
the us point of view that not only must the nicaraguan contras be 
demobilized but that demands also must be placed on ortegas 
sandinista government 
quayles involvement came as the latins themselves continued 
moving to shape their own political landscape 
they got the rolling summit going when felipe gonzales brought 
his plane to venezuela to ferry a group to chiles inauguration of 
patricio aylwin last sunday 
the passengers included presidents president carlos andres perez 
of venezuela oscar arias of costa rica rafael callejas of 
honduras and ortega 
the powerful assemblage of regional leaders was an example of 
the dramatic and casual diplomacy that was ubiquitous both in chile 
and brazil 
in santiagos hotel carrera arias walked down the lobby stairs 
from a meeting with quayle as spains gonzalez walked in they 
embraced and cameras whirred 
mensaje recibido gonzalez told arias message received 
nobody else knew what the exchange meant but the moment seemed 
to underscore the behindthescenes work by the leaders trying to 
get the contra rebels demobilized and achieve a peaceful transition 
of government in nicaragua 
at fernando collor de mellos inauguration in brasilia the 
latin presidents huddled on the floor of the national congress in 
conversations that moved back and forth between groups of two and 
three and five 
arias who won a nobel prize for spearheading the nicaragua 
peace plan that led to elections last month chatted at length with 
perez one of the most dominant leaders of the region 
ortega arrived and stayed by arias side as they greeted others 
flowing to and from their group 
among those who stopped by cubas fidel castro

yellowed drawings from henri matisses 
sketchbook in morocco many of them unknown to art scholars for 
nearly 80 years will be displayed publicly for the first time 
sunday at the national gallery of art 
the exhibition of paintings and drawings by the french 
postimpressionist during two visits to morocco also represents a 
breakthrough in ussoviet cultural collaboration says gallery 
director j carter brown 
it is the first exhibition mounted jointly by us and soviet 
curators from beginning to end he said with contributions from 
the pushkin museum of fine arts in moscow and the hermitage museum 
in leningrad 
the show contains 23 matisse paintings more than half never 
exhibited in the united states and 47 drawings whose existence was 
largely unknown until their discovery during a threeyear search of 
private collections scattered throughout europe 
matisse spent several months in 1912 and 1913 exploring the 
exotic streets and cafes of tangier in search of new artistic 
themes many of his 25 moroccan paintings were quickly purchased by 
moscow art collectors ivan morosov and sergei shchukin and wound 
up in soviet museums 
his drawings were dispersed among family members friends and 
private collectors in europe and forgotten 
jack cowart curator of 20th century art at the national 
gallery said his curatorial teams voyage of discovery 
uncovered a bonanza of 67 matisse drawings from morocco 
one of the sketches a view of tangier from the window of 
matisses hotel joined the exhibition monday night after a flight 
from france 
its existence was confirmed in a telephone call to matisse 
scholar pierre schneider by the granddaughter of the former 
proprietor of the hotel villa de france where matisse stayed in 
tangier 
in all the curators uncovered a bonanza of 67 matisse drawings 
from morocco of the 47 being displayed at the gallery all but 
three have never been exhibited before cowart refuses to say where 
the newly discovered drawings were found 
all of matisses paintings from that pivotal period in his 
artistic career are in the show except for two one is extremely 
fragile and cannot leave the hermitage museum the other is held by 
the barnes foundation near philadelphia under terms that forbid its 
public display 
brown said the exhibition represents not only one of the most 
dazzling moments in 20th century art but also new chapters in the 
study of matisses art and in the cooperation of museums and 
scholars of east and west 
cowart said soviet art officials had expressed interest in late 
1987 in collaborating on a joint exhibition instead of merely 
agreeing on an even swap of pictures 
over lunch at the national gallery a few months later cowart 
said the soviet ministry of culture officially expressed interest 
and brown turned over the matissemorocco card 
they instantly said yes right lets get on with it cowart 
said and the joint venture was sealed 
the exhibition will run at the national gallery through june 3 
it will appear at the museum of modern art in new york which 
helped organize the show from june 24 through sept 4 it will 
travel to moscow for an appearance at the pushkin museum from sept 
28 through nov 20 and to the hermitage from dec 15 through feb 
15 1991

even inflationhardened 
argentines were stunned by phone bills arriving last week that were 
as much as 17 times higher than the last ones 
antonio lecce paid 360 last month and expects to get a 40 
bill this month thats about half a months pay for the hundreds 
of thousands of public employees in argentina where one of every 
five adults lacks a fulltime job 
i just wont pay it said lecce 50 its better to have 
them take the phone away than to sell the house to pay the phone 
bill 
a group representing thousands of small businesses said friday 
its members received unjust and unpayable bills that are as 
much as 2000 percent higher than the last ones it asked president 
carlos menem to intervene 
rates went up march 9 by what the state telephone company entel 
said was an average 433 percent 
bills however contain much higher rates the latest bimonthly 
service charge plus 200 calls for example increased by 1682 
percent to 31816 australs 675 from the previous 1785 
australs 
a typical familys bill jumped nearly 10fold to 4380 
prohibitively high for most 
there is no relation between what they charge us and what we 
earn said jorge milovich 52 
the governments explanation is that rates were eroded by 
inflation which skyrocketed by 12000 percent in the past year 
the increase in january alone was 79 percent and 62 percent last 
month 
also rates had to be increased to allow a profit at a 
deficitridden company the government is trying desperately to sell 
people who cant afford the new rates may have to share 
telephones company director maria julia alsogaray said 
the increases and alsogarays comments outraged argentines 
who live with substandard phone service to begin with their phones 
go dead when it rains and even on the sunniest days it is 
difficult to get dial tone or get the right connection on the first 
try 
we now have telephones with international prices but we dont 
have internationalquality service fernando bravo of radio 
rivadavia told listeners 
cynical argentines allege the increase will force people to 
default on their payments thus allowing entel to take over lines 
and resell them to people who have been unable to get lines because 
of a shortage 
lines commonly are stolen and sold on a black market illegal 
telephone wires flap from dozens of downtown office buildings and 
apartments 
while the increased revenue may balance accounts it also may 
fuel public opposition to a controversial plan to sell entel 
critics claim it represents a loss of national sovereignty and 
that entel is virtually being given away to private interests 
alsogaray told congress last week that the company which 
administers 3 million lines thoughout this nation of 32 million is 
valued at 17 billion sixty percent is being offered to investors 
for 1 billion in cash and debtequity swaps 
rodolfo terragno the public works minister for the previous 
government said he thought the sale would go through because the 
peronist party controls the presidency and congress the former 
government tried to sell entel in 1988 but was barred by congress 
argentines may not be happy if the sale is made 
i think service will get better but fewer people will have 
phones terragno said 
roberto jiminez like thousands of argentines waited years to 
get a phone line now it looks like ill have to give it up he 
said

the legislators who most closely oversee 
americas defense budget reaped 2 million in campaign 
contributions last year from political action committees affiliated 
with the defense industry 
the biggest chunks went to committee leaders and other 
legislators who are particularly influential on military matters 
according to an associated press analysis of campaign receipts by 
members of four key congressional panels 
the committees will play a major role in determining how the 
prodemocracy movement in eastern europe and improved relations 
with the soviet union are translated into pentagon budget cuts that 
could have a big impact on defense contractors 
ninetytwo of the 104 legislators who serve on the four panels 
got money from defense pacs with the largest share going to sen 
j bennett johnson a louisiana democrat who sits on the senate 
appropriations defense subcommittee 
johnston received 128000 from defense pacs whose sponsors read 
like a whos who of military contractors 
the ap analysis covered pac contributions to members of the 
defense subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations 
committees and to members of each chambers armed services panel 
in good times and bad it is common practice for special 
interests to target their pac contributions to legislators with 
influence in their fields 
bankingrelated pacs for example gave nearly 6 million in the 
198788 election cycle to legislators on committees with 
jurisdiction over banking issues according to the newsletter pacs 
amp lobbies 
congress for years has been debating campaign finance reforms 
that would limit the role of pacs in congressional races yet many 
lawmakers and pac officials reject the contention of public 
interest groups that specialinterest money unduly influences 
congressional votes 
a spokesman for johnston tony garrett said it makes sense 
that people in the defense industry would support those who favor a 
strong national defense and who are key players in defense policy 
they also know the senator through his efforts to bring more 
defense industries to louisiana 
a prominent player in the campaign finance deliberations rep 
beryl anthony chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee said there is nothing wrong with accepting pac money but 
that the soaring costs of campaigns have perhaps created the 
perception that lawmakers are too reliant on special interest money 
taking a legal pac contribution is not sleazy anthony said 
in an interview friday the culprit is in how much money it takes 
to run an election 
the 1989 pac contributions detailed in yearend campaign 
finance reports to the federal election commission cover the first 
half of the 198990 election cycle fundraising generally 
escalates during election years and past donors are among the 
first targets to be tapped 
on top of pac contributions additional money from defense 
contractors is channeled to lawmakers as honoraria for speeches and 
other appearances in 1987 for example members of the four 
defenserelated committees received 521000 in honoraria from the 
top 50 defense contractors according to the common cause advocacy 
group 
legislators also receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
contributions from labor union pacs whose members work at defense 
plants and from pacs for lobbying firms whose clients include major 
defense contractors the 2 million figure however covers only 
donations from pacs affiliated with defense contractors 
pacs affiliated with companies that would be most affected by 
major reductions in defense spending were among the biggest 
financial backers of members of the four congressional panels 
general motors corps pacs for example distributed nearly 
140000 last year among 75 members of the four defenserelated 
committees according to the ap analysis gms donations included 
those from its corporate pac and from the pacs of its electronic 
data systems and hughes aircraft subsidiaries 
not far behind was mcdonnell douglas corp whose two pacs gave 
132000 to 73 members of the congressional panels next were 
textron inc and lockheed corp whose pacs each made 103000 in 
1989 contributions to members of the four committees 
coming in just short of 100000 in total donations to the 
committee members were the pacs associated with grumman corp 
northrop corp and raytheon co raytheons totals include donations 
by the pac of its beech aircraft subsidiary 
pacs for martin marietta corp rockwell international corp 
united technologies corp boeing co general dynamics corp ltv 
corp and westinghouse electric corp contributed between 50000 
and 90000 each to members of the defenserelated congressional 
panels 
while the chairmen and ranking republicans of the congressional 
committees generally were among the biggest recipients of 
defenseindustry pac money there was one major exception last year 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate defense 
appropriations panel received just 1000 in defenseindustry pac 
money 2150 in total pac donations inouye who is not up for 
reelection until 1992 received 52000 in defense pac money 
during the 198586 election cycle 
the ranking republican on that same panel alaska sen ted 
stevens reported defenseindustry pac contributions of 112500 in 
1989 and total pac contributions of 497000 he is heavily favored 
for reelection this year 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee democrat 
sam nunn of georgia received more than 489000 from pacs in 1989 
of which 88000 came from the defense industry the panels 
ranking republican john warner of virginia received 395000 from 
pacs 86000 of it from the defense industry 
other big recipients of defense pac money included 
rep john p murtha dpa chairman of the house defense 
appropriations subcommittee he received 150000 from pacs last 
year 55500 of it from the defense industry 
rep joseph m mcdade of pennsylvania ranking republican on 
the same panel he raised 79000 from pacs 36000 of it from the 
defense industry mcdade who is under fbi investigation for his 
relationship with a nowdefunct defense contractor used all of his 
1989 campaign contributions to pay legal fees 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee aspin received 135000 from pacs last year of which 
41000 came from the defense industry 
rep william l dickinson of alabama senior republican on the 
armed services committee dickinson received 52000 last year from 
defenseindustry pacs representing 71 percent of his 72000 in 
total pac receipts

striking teachers in two counties have 
voted to return to work monday marking the first defections in the 
11dayold teachers strike 
teachers in the largely rural jackson and greenbrier counties 
voted friday to end their walkout after being warned they could 
lose their jobs if they remained on strike both county school 
boards promised not to punish striking teachers if they return 
monday 
also friday the state supreme court upheld a lower courts 
order that striking teachers in one county return to work but it 
later overrode another judges attempt to issue a statewide 
backtowork order 
senate president keith burdette and house of delegates speaker 
chuck chambers scheduled informal talks by telephone and planned to 
talk later today with the west virginia education association and 
the west virginia federation of teachers 
chuck and i havent agreed yet on what has to be done 
burdette said all were trying to determine is if we can offer 
something rational to all the parties involved 
wvea spokeswoman jackie goodwin said the discussions since 
midweek have been positive but that its too early to say that the 
strike is nearing an end 
if a genuine solution is reached that will be seen goodwin 
said at this point we dont have anything in concrete and the 
strike continues 
talks between the legislative leaders and the teachers began 
when gov gaston caperton said he would no longer negotiate with 
teachers after they rejected his third offer for ending the walkout 
burdette said he and chambers met with union representatives 
thursday and friday but reached no agreement 
the strike has prompted a series of court hearings around the 
state in school officials attempt to get teachers to return to 
work the latest resulted in the state supreme court on friday 
overriding a kanawha county circuit judges statewide backtowork 
order 
the series of court rulings began friday morning when the state 
supreme court ruling in a jefferson county case upheld the right 
of circuit judges to order teachers back to work on a 
countybycounty basis ohio and berkeley county court judges also 
have issued backtowork orders 
acting on the high courts ruling attorney general roger 
tompkins sought a statewide injunction friday afternoon from 
kanawha county circuit judge john hey 
i think the attorney general has sustained the burden 
necessary to demonstrate that irreparable harm exists and will 
continue to exist as long as those children are out of school 
hey said in making his ruling how can anyone sit there with a 
straight face and say theres not irreparable harm 
as hey ruled the two teachers unions were asking the state 
supreme court to block his action contending the state must seek 
injunctions in each of the 55 counties 
the high court voted 40 to stay heys ruling and set a hearing 
on the case for tuesday 
state school superintendent hank marockie said earlier friday 
that teachers who began striking march 7 will be notified by 
letter of potential disciplinary action if they refuse to return to 
work 
strike activity was reported in 47 counties on wednesday when 
marockie ordered schools closed for two days to ease tensions at 
that time only about onethird of the states nearly 22000 
teachers showed up for work the department of education said 
the states teachers earn an average 21904 a year according 
to the national education association less than teachers in every 
state except arkansas and south dakota 
caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay raises 
is to raise taxes which he said the public opposes the teachers 
received a 5 percent pay raise earlier this year along with other 
public employees

on the assembly line at textron lycoming 
where technicians worry over stout tank engines terms like peace 
dividend and defense budget cuts take on ominous and concrete 
meaning 
this sprawling plant made corsair fighters during world war ii 
helicopter engines for the vietnam war and m1 tank engines during 
the reaganera defense buildup 
now the company faces a slowdown as sudden as any that could be 
brought on by a surrender or a peace treaty 
the army planned to buy close to 600 tanks a year said g 
russell zink a vice president at textron lycoming now they plan 
to buy zero 
the army was required to come in with cuts massive cuts 
where they took a cut it was a meataxe approach zink said 
while not alone in facing defense cuts connecticut on a per 
capita basis is one of the largest if not the largest military 
contracting state 
overall connecticut ranked ninth in the nation in 1988 the 
most recent year for which statistics are available with 49 
billion in military contracts california was by far the largest 
with 23 billion in contracts but connecticut was ahead of such 
states as new jersey washington and arizona 
state officials military contractors and industry analysts have 
been expecting connecticut to face severe cutbacks what has been 
surprising is how quickly the indicators of lean times have 
surfaced 
textron is faced with laying off some 1350 workers a third 
of its workforce in stratford conn unless the pentagon can be 
persuaded to produce at least some m1 tanks over the next few 
years 
sikorsky aircraft just up main street from textron laid off 
300 whitecollar workers last month us military contracts for 
its helicopters have declined from 165 in 1987 to 120 this year 
the company has been expanding its civilian helicopter business and 
is even talking about making light rail cars 
unc inc announced last week it would phase out its 
uncasville conn naval products division one of only two 
facilities in the country for building nuclear submarine engines 
the move will eventually displace 950 workers bruce andrews who 
heads the unc division called the decision the inevitable 
consequence of reduced defense spending 
textron has enlisted the connecticut congressional delegation to 
lobby for a softening of the bush administrations nonewtanks 
position rep john rowland rconn a member of the house armed 
services committee said army secretary michael stone was 
cautiously optimistic in a recent meeting that a minimal level 
of tank production can be maintained 
the army is working on a on a new heavy tank but production is 
several years away in the meantime with troop reductions on the 
way in western europe the army decided it could do without any 
more m1s after current production contracts expire 
textron which has been making about 1000 engines per year 
would be able to make up only a fraction of that loss by boosting 
foreign sales 
the m1 program like other major defense contracts is spread 
around among several states a strategy that some critics have said 
hinders efficiency while strengthening political support for costly 
weapons systems 
major parts and assembly plants are located in michigan ohio 
and pennsylvania suppliers for the 1500 horsepower gas turbine 
engine alone are spread among 32 states 
members from some of those states are expected to grill top army 
officials at an armed services hearing this week but just as many 
members appear to be pushing for greater reductions in defense 
spending to free up money for deficit reduction or domestic 
programs 
the government has more at stake at textron lycoming than at 
other defense industries around the country over the past five 
yeras the army and textron spent more than 120 million to 
modernize the plant for highspeed production and to meet wartime 
requirements 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo is preparing 
legislation that would help defense industries nationwide convert 
to civilian production one uncertainty about the bill is whether 
it will receive the bush administrations backing 
the presidents proposal for the peace dividend is to help 
other countries said rep sam gejdenson dconn whose district 
includes the unc plant well im all for helping others but 
there ought to be a peace dividend for americans 
defense analysts and industry executives are uncertain about 
whether converting some defense industries to civilian pursuits is 
a realistic option 
where does norden systems build radars for nondefense 
industries what does general dynamics electric boat do about 
nondefense submarines said ron hertsenstein research director 
at forecast international in newtown conn a defense industry 
consulting firm 
gejdenson rejects that thinking 
the only other choice he said is just walking away from 
it all and thats not acceptable

government officials have begun final work on a 
package of reforms aimed at restructuring the economy and diffusing 
trade friction with the united states a government spokesman said 
saturday 
the measures were presented to leaders of the governing liberal 
democratic party on friday night said an official from the prime 
ministers office he said details of the plan could not be 
disclosed because it is under negotiation with washington 
the asahi shimbun a major japanese newspaper said the contents 
of the draft are far away from the concrete improvements demanded 
by the us side and negotiations with the united states will 
surely face difficulties 
but other media reports said the draft addresses us concerns 
about a law that protects small japanese businesses by making it 
very difficult to set up large retail stores 
the united states has demanded the law be changed to allow more 
big stores because they generally carry more imported goods 
currently it can take up to 10 years to get permission to open 
a large store here but the proposal would reduce that to one year 
according to the reports 
it also would revise and tighten an antitrust law on illegal 
cartels increasing fines from the current average of 15 percent 
on profits according to a government source 
the issues have been discussed at ongoing talks between us and 
japanese trade officials aimed at reducing japans huge trade 
surplus a progress report on those talks is due in midapril 
regarding the law on large stores a trade ministry official 
said our basic policy on the law is to implement it in an 
appropriate manner not to abolish it 
an official of the liberal democratic party said most of the 
party supports this view but added that there would be a strong 
opposing argument in the party toward revising and eliminating the 
retail law he said a workinglevel delegation will be sent to 
the united states on monday 
both officials spoke on condition of anonymity

mayor marion barry is refusing to write 
himself out of the political script for the nations capital even 
as he fights cocaine and perjury charges and confronts his personal 
addictions 
im back i feel good about myself barry declared as he 
returned to the district last week after seven weeks of substance 
abuse treatment in florida and south carolina 
in speeches and interviews since his return the mayor has tried 
to portray himself as a man rededicated to his job and waging a 
courageous battle against alcoholism and addiction to tranquilizers 
he also says hell triumph over his legal problems 
he is the walking definition of chutzpah and the main reason 
for that is that his entire life he has been doing things people 
have told him he cannot do said local political commentator mark 
plotkin 
barry vowed to complete his term in office and left open the 
possibility of seeking reelection in november 
whether i run or dont run i am not going to sit on the 
sidelines and let the city just go without any advice from me he 
said in one interview 
barry charged with cocaine possession after an fbi sting 
operation at a washington hotel in january openly admits to a 
chemical dependency on alcohol and tranquilizers but has 
skirted questions about cocaine 
the mayor is scheduled for trial june 4 on five misdemeanor 
charges of cocaine possession and three counts of lying to a grand 
jury about his drug involvement conviction on any of the perjury 
charges would permanently bar him from holding office but barry 
insists he will beat the charges in court 
barrys legal and political troubles have left other mayoral 
hopefuls scrambling to siphon off his supporters but the man who 
has directed the local political scene for more than a decade shows 
no signs of relinquishing power 
the mayor is clearly enjoying himself and is taking pleasure 
at sharing the personal human side of this said one barry 
campaign aide who requested anonymity 
hes revved up and weve received a lot of support the 
aide said were trying to assess whether the personal support 
will translate into political support but were optimistic 
mayoral hopeful walter fauntroy currently the districts 
democratic nonvoting delegate to congress cut short a trip to 
israel and hurried back to washington after he got word of barrys 
early return 
an aide described fauntroy as extremely nervous about 
barrys political plans 
in a 30minute public address upon his return barry repeatedly 
insisted that he has learned from his mistakes and turned the 
corner on what he described as his alcohol problem 
the mayor lashed out at the media and portrayed himself as the 
victim of unwarranted personal attacks and selfimposed job 
pressures 
at one point he was interrupted by chants of four more 
years from city workers and supporters who crowded into the 
municipal building to hear his speech 
when barry promised to announce his political plans in the 
very near future the crowd cheered even louder 
public opinion polls show that barry still enjoys the support of 
between 20 percent and 25 percent of the voters which might be 
enough to put him on top in a crowded democratic primary field that 
already includes five candidates 
if all those candidates are in the race come primary day 
anythings possible plotkin said barry simply cannot be 
dismissed 
barry is reading the polls too 
i have been encouraged and really elated by the hardcore 
support i have had in this town he said now that all of this 
has happened even our own polls show 32 percent support barry 
some political observers said barrys homecoming speech was 
directed as much toward the prospective jurors for his upcoming 
trial as toward the voters 
with this performance hes running for acquittal as much as 
running for office plotkin said

relief workers and several governments 
fear that an ambitious un program to help returning afghan 
refugees is premature because refugees are not returning to a 
country still in the throes of war 
sadruddin aga khan coordinator of the un refugee repatriation 
program recently appealed for more money to ease what he called 
the suffering of hundreds of thousands of afghan people he chided 
governments for failing to meet this years 650 million target 
japan froze a 43 million contribution to sadruddins 
operation salam saying money was being wasted on programs for 
refugees who arent returning to their homeland 
several aid workers in this rugged border city have echoed 
japans fears saying most of the 38 million refugees living in 
pakistan arent going home because they say the war is not over 
another 2 million refugees living in iran also are refusing to 
return home 
everything depends on what happens on the political side 
said a us diplomat referring to a negotiated end to the brutal 
11year war that has reportedly left 15 million dead 
the primary reason refugees wont leave is still security 
she said on condition of anonymity 
almost two years ago sadruddin made an impassioned plea for 
donations conjuring up visions of hundreds of thousands of 
refugees swarming back to afghanistan he asked for 12 billion 
but last year fewer than 100000 refugees left pakistans 
squalid camps where open sewers snake through a maze of mud huts 
and tents to return to afghanistan 
and 100000 is nothing when you have almost 4 million said 
the us diplomat 
most of them say they will go when there is peace and 
security said pierce gerety deputy chief of the un high 
commissioner for refugees mission in islamabad 
they are afraid of the bombings but they are also afraid of 
the complete lack of law and order in mujahedeencontrolled 
areas he said 
the country is crawling with angry armed males said a 
second un official who refused identification his headquarters 
is in peshawar and several times he has slipped across pakistans 
border to afghanistan 
usbacked moslem insurgents have been fighting successive 
communistbacked governments in kabul since a 1978 coup toppled 
mohammad daoud a cousin of afghanistans exmonarch they call 
themselves mujahedeen meaning islamic holy warriors because 
they believe they are battling to safeguard islam against an 
atheist government 
several aid organizations headquartered in pakistan and even 
the un high commissioenr say sadruddin set his sights too high 
asking for 12 billion to repatriate refugees 
japan sent a team to study sadruddins programs in january 
fujio samukawa first secretary at japans embassy in islamabad 
said japan fears some japanesefunded programs are not being 
monitored adequately and that money is being wasted 
donors have gradually become very skeptical about the 
likelihood of repatriation said a un official who asked not 
to be identified it was a bit of a false start

a building leased by the federal drug 
enforcement administration was gutted early today by a large 
firebomb and investigators were studying recent indictments in an 
attempt to identify suspects authorities said 
no injuries were reported 
somebody bombed the dea office by throwing a pipe bomb through 
a window said frank shultz spokesman for the federal agency 
all dea personnel are accountedfor he added the bombing 
occurred about 230 am 
the fire gutted the 6000squarefoot onestory building at a 
shoppingbusiness mall which the dea leases he said there was no 
immediate estimate of damage the drug agency was the only tenant 
in the building 
a second explosion was reported during the night in a 
residential area in south central fort myers said sheri peterson 
a spokeswoman for the lee county sheriffs office she did not have 
any details on the incident 
she said there were no injuries in either incident she would 
not say whether the two bombings were related 
john fernandes dea spokesman from the miami field office said 
federal agents were investigating numerous possibilities to find 
who carried out the bombing 
it could be one of many individuals he said if you look 
at the productivity of the fort myers office theyve been 
knocking them dead lately were checking all the most recent 
indictments 
only thursday a drug indictment was issued in fort myers and 
two of those indicted are still at large but federal officials 
cautioned they are not connecting that indictment to the bombing 
yet 
although the records at the office were destroyed authorities 
said there are copies at other locations 
this is an act of desperation said fernandes if they 
think this is a setback for us its not this shows were on the 
right track 
we are officeautomated so a lot of what we put on paper we 
also put in computer a lot of what you think we would lose we 
have duplicated copies of fernandes said 
the second bombing may have been just a diversion he said 
fort myers is in southwestern florida on the gulf coast 
shultz said the fire marshal at fort myers said the fire was 
started by a large incendiary device

supporters of new subsidies to help rural 
areas diversify their economies are having to regroup after being 
dealt a severe setback in the house this past week 
the floor managers of a rural development bill want to renew 
their effort on the house floor but senate experts now suggest the 
effort may have better chances for success if it is folded into a 
more comprehensive farm bill later this year 
designed to pump new life into dying villages and towns the 
bill by senior members of the house agriculture committee would 
have allowed states to divert to industrial development federal 
money now earmarked for sewer and water projects 
about 600 million in existing water and sewer funds another 
100 million designated for community facilities plus 100 million 
devoted to business and industry development all would have been 
pooled into one account 
sixteenmember state review panels then could divide their share 
any way they wanted according to local priorities with the 
secretary of agriculture retaining ultimate authority on how the 
money is distributed 
opponents however succeeded last thursday in passing an 
amendment that effectively prohibits commingling the three funds 
the only significant money in the bill for improving rural 
conditions 
rep charles rose dnc argued that intermixing the funds 
would give the agriculture secretary too much discretionary power 
rose whose state has received more than its initial allotment 
of the funds under the current formula because other states did not 
spend all of their share also said taking money away from sewers 
and water projects could be detrimental than the lack of new 
business subsidies for rural areas 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee rep e de la 
garza dtexas and the chairman of its rural development 
subcommittee rep glenn english dokla said friday they would 
look for a new approach to save the bill 
a significantly different rural development bill already has 
been approved by the senate 
sponsored by sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee it features 300 million revolving fund for 
new businesses and satellite education and health communications 
systems 
the senate committee put together a comparison of the two bills 
that says the house version would authorize 25 billion over five 
years while the senate measure would authorize 15 billion over 
the same period 
while the house bill would establish a new agency to organize 
the programs the senate version simply directs the agriculture 
secretary to review and report on reorganization 
the senate bill would provide new grants and loans for rural 
schools medical providers and telecommunications business 
partnerships the house measure includes only a policy statement 
saying that existing agencies should continue financing 
telecommunications infrastructure improvements

minnesota farmer owen gustafson has little in 
common with the ambassador of belize but they agree on one thing 
the us sugar program is encouraging latin american peasants to 
grow illegal drugs 
gustafson a corn and wheat grower from montevideo minn told 
a house committee last week that belize became the worlds fourth 
largest exporter of marijuana after its us sugar exports were cut 
by 75 percent 
the loss of a market place due to the us sugar program 
pushed people into drug trafficking gustafson said 
the tiny central american country is one of several 
sugarproducing nations from mexico to argentina that is lobbying 
congress to loosen the import quotas that help prop up prices for 
us sugar growers 
complaints about the import quotas are a key part of this years 
debate about renewing the 8yearold sugar program one of the most 
controversial components of american farm policy 
the program is the bread and butter of many farmers in eastern 
north dakota and western minnesota who grow 40 percent of us 
sugar beets 
the program guarantees a minimum price for sugar that works out 
to 18 cents per pound for sugar from cane and 215 cents per pound 
for beet sugar the bush administration has proposed to leave the 
sugar program alone in the 1990 farm bill 
however the administration has raised the ire of sugar 
producers by proposing to replace the import quotas with tariffs 
because of rulings under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
that the quota system is unfair 
sugar growers want the administration to leave the quotas alone 
and are asking congress to raise the minimum price that farmers are 
paid 
the sugar program is a farm program it is not a foreign aid 
program ronald hayes president of moorhead minnbased 
american crystal sugar co said in testimony before a house 
agriculture subcommittee 
its primary function is to insulate us sugar producers as 
well as consumers from the unfair undependable and unstable world 
sugar market hayes said 
but belize and other countries say the import quotas have 
stymied their efforts at economic development and democratization 
several sugar mills in the 14 caribbean and central american 
sugargrowing countries have been closed down because the us 
quota has been cut in half over the past five years from 11 
million to 570000 tons said belize ambassador edward laing 
the group of latin american and caribbean sugar exporting 
countries an organization of 22 countries that accounts for 45 
percent of world sugar exports claims its us shipments fell 
from 32 million tons in 1981 to 950000 in 1988 
it is a fact that until our sugar situation is stabilized it 
will be impossible to achieve economic growth and social stability 
in the region laing said 
but the american sugarbeet growers association proposed congress 
boost the minimum price to 20 cents per pound and require the 
administration to raise the price further to keep up with future 
increases in production costs 
the associations president patrick mahar said world sugar 
prices ranged from 27 cents to 41 cents per pound during the 1980s 
however the sweetener users association an industry group

in a twist to the israeliamerican military 
relationship the united states is trying to sell israel a 
sophisticated antimissile defense system but the israelis are not 
sure they want to buy 
the case reflects the impact that the reduced soviet threat in 
europe is having on thriving us defense manufacturers 
usually israel is the one pressing the united states to sell it 
weapons systems this time the defense department and the raytheon 
co of lexington mass are the ones doing the pressing 
raytheon manufactures the patriot a landbased missile system 
originally designed to shoot down aircraft several years ago 
raytheon reconfigured the system so it also could shoot down 
mediumrange missiles 
israel could use the weapon to respond to a growing threat from 
vastly increased missile arsenals in the arab world israel is 
especially worried about chemical warheads which two of its most 
implacable enemies syria and iraq reportedly have 
the 100 million patriot package comes equipped with a radar to 
detect and track targets and a command center to issue firing 
instructions to the missiles 
in an annual report of possible arms sales for fiscal year 1990 
the state department informed congress that israel may buy the 
patriot under secretary of defense paul wolfowitz discussed 
details of the sale on a visit to israel in january 
defense secretary dick cheney told young american jewish leaders 
several days ago that discussions about the patriot sale were under 
way 
but sources close to the deal say israel is far from sold 
theres still a long way to go toward a possible purchase i 
say possible and not necessarily probable said one source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity he said a decision is not expected 
for several months 
in israel last week a military official said the patriot only 
gives limited solution to the missile problem so we dont intend 
to buy it at this stage 
we are looking at other systems the official said whil 
declining to elaborate 
israels dilemma is the cost versus the threat for the 200 
million the united states is asking for two patriot systems israel 
would need it could produce the next generation of an antimissile 
missile known as the arrow 
the arrow program is a component of the strategic defense 
initiative the spacebased defense system being developed by the 
united states which the pentagon has farmed out to israel for 
research and development 
the first phase of the arrow project began in 1988 and is due 
for completion this year ahead of schedule us officials say 
the first testfiring is expected this july and another three by 
july 1991 
the second phase which would prepare the missile for 
production reportedly would cost about 200 million israel would 
like the sdi program to foot the bill for the second phase but the 
pentagon has not decided 
i would expect this is going to be a difficult decision 
said gen robert hammond commander of the army strategic defense 
command at huntsville ala where sdi research is conducted 
us officials say the main focus of the arrow development is to 
design an effective response to chemical warheads theyre trying 
to get up to negate the chemical threat said edward l 
wilkinson director of the kinetic energy weapons directorate of 
the us army 
in any event the arrow would not be ready for deployment for 
another five to 10 years the patriot said one us official is 
a bandaid for the meantime but an expensive one 
among other concerns israeli officials say is whether the 
patriot could effectively destroy a chemical warhead without 
risking fallout of lethal poisons on populated areas the distances 
between israel and its arab neighbors are so small that this is an 
important concern 
in addition in order to be effective the patriot radar would 
have to be cued by satelliteborne early warning systems 
something israel does not possess 
an arrangement would have to be worked out with the united 
states to supply that service a us official said this would 
make israel dependent on the united states to a degree it is 
reluctant to accept an israeli source said 
raytheon which has sold the patriot to west germany and the 
netherlands is eager to sell to israel too us officials say 
it already has had one setback with italy which agreed in 
principle to buy the patriot but which now is hesitating in light 
of the changing defense needs in europe officials say 
defense week a trade publication reported last month that 
1200 raytheon employees could lose their jobs unless italy agrees 
this month to the 500 million deal a ompany spokeswoman declined 
to discuss the report 
the company already has been hard hit by the pentagons decision 
to stop the production of the antiaircraft hawk missiles

claude montana scored a solid hit saturday with his 
readytowear show for winter putting him right back at the top of 
the fashion big leagues after a brief stumble 
with his trapeze coats use of furs and soft leathers and 
bright colors montana soared back as a fashion leader after his 
disappointing debut in haute couture for lanvin in january 
looking rather like lowkeyed readytowear the lanvin show 
drew harsh criticism from many but in this offering for his own 
line montana proved to be a master 
the fastpaced show led off with a sergeant pepper group of 
bright yellow and red fitted military jackets and chain fastenings 
over fitted slim pants 
he then laid on a group of full trapezeline minicoats in a 
dressy new stiffened woolfaille fabric these sometimes topped 
miniskirts with matching bright tights and bootees more often he 
opted for stirrupbottomed stretch satin fabrics sometimes 
stitched or seamed up the sides 
montana had been rumored to be very depressed over reaction to 
his lanvin show but with colors like mandarin orange bright 
yellow chartreuse and cornflower blue it appeared optimism had 
won out 
montana also had a field day with his favorite sheared minks 
turning out parkas trapeze shorties or anoraks in the furs they 
usually had hoods or wide collars framing hooded ribbed knits 
underneath 
the hooded canadiennes are a big trend running through all 
current worldwide shows and no one does them better than montana 
his drawstring parkas also looked better than most anybody 
elses the little red riding hoods were sensational in 
velsaquez red or pine green soft suede called nubuk worn with 
matching minis or cigarette pants with high heels 
there were also quilted suede anoraks and boleros and fitted 
zippered suits in shiny calf with its fur plus a big puff of 
daffodil yellow mongolian lamb over the lean lines underneath 
belted in bright red 
as a change of pace montana showed a quieter line of silvery 
gray flannel suits elegantly fitted with rib seams plus a few 
chinchilla jackets over the skirts cigarette pants or jumpsuits 
his mondrian line of tentlike coats in big solids of red 
yellow or bright blue combined with patches of white and gray 
topped bicolored lean jersey pants or minis 
at the venerated house of balenciaga michel goma got a big hand 
for his jazzy collection also full of furs and eyecatching colors 
goma who briefly had his own fashion house that closed in 1963 
and then worked for patou came to balenciaga a couple of seasons 
ago he did little to emulate balenciagas perfect chic but this 
was readytowear 
the daytime clothes were better than evening looks that could be 
summed up by sequined glitz sparkly but otherwise 
unimpressive 
his opening number of belted big cableknit jackets in algae or 
moss green combined with silver minis and belts were new 
there were good teal blue or chartreuse jackets in boucle 
houndstooth patterns over shortskirted jersey tunic suits 
goma did some good dressy looks with watery moire silk often 
topping sheaths with decollete ruffled jackets or shrug boleros in 
black or redgreen combinations 
he won out in both his fake ecological and real furs there 
were long bicolored golden and chestnut sable coats a black 
breitschwantz maxi mini coats in black or red beaver 
his excellent fakes included a belted panther jacket with a big 
collar over a lean miniskirt 
the gres boutique show by japanese takeshi sasaki started out 
well enough with handsome brown trapeze coats velvet and 
ribbedknit fitted jackets over lean cropped pants 
but things got very heavy with a series of dreary long jerseys 
in tones of beige mouse gray and brown there wasnt a jewel or 
bright scarf in sight to pep up the clothes which resembled at 
times a schoolmistress outfit

the fur coat is quickly going from status symbol to 
stigma as conservation groups and antifur activists step up the 
campaign to help animals save their skins 
it takes 40 dumb animals to make a fur coat but only one to 
wear it says the slogan emblazoned across tshirts by the 
british animal rights group lynx 
the use of endangered species such as leopard and tiger for 
fur coats has been illegal more than a decade but it was not until 
recent years that activists declared war on the use of any pelt 
from the ranch mink to the wild sable 
the campaign started in the united states and gathered such 
momentum that citizens of aspen colo recently tried to pass a 
law to ban the sale of fur the attempt failed but the point was 
made 
in europe where women don their furs from october through march 
regardless of the weather the movement started more slowly but 
taking the cue from england antifur branches of animal rights 
groups have cropped up across the continent 
the european fur industrys most visible setback was the closing 
in february of the fur salon at harrods department store in london 
it had clad the rich and famous nearly a century 
the store said sales had dropped more than 40 percent in the 
past four years 
celebrities such as paul and linda mccartney and the former 
model twiggy support animal rights groups in england actress kate 
omara now writes her refusal to wear fur coats into her contracts 
after she was forced to wear one in episodes of dynasty 
across the channel french furriers have also suffered losses 
a drop in sales of 27 percent to 30 percent over the past three 
years according to georges constant president of the french 
furriers guild 
constant blames mild winters and rising prices as much as the 
ecologists for furs waning popularity 
moreover french furriers far from being on the run are 
fighting back against activists they consider out of line 
according to constant the guild recently won a lawsuit against 
a film that showed animals being killed and was described by its 
maker as a documentary the guild insisted the film was an 
advertisement 
the fur coat is still popular among germans and the annual fur 
fair in frankfurt continues to be europes major fur event 
however animal rights groups connected with the powerful 
environmentalist greens party stage periodic protests including 
demonstrations at christmas in front of major department stores 
with fur salons 
in recent years antifur activists also have released a number 
of minks from mink ranches near the city of mainz 
surprisingly sunny italy is one of europes largest fur 
consumers according to a recent survey 59 million women nearly 
one out of four in italy own at least one fur coat 
the antivivisection league linked to the local greens party 
is trying to turn the trend around with demonstrations furcoat 
bonfires and the freeing of animals from fur farms 
on march 10 the activists demonstrated on the streets of pavia 
where italys largest fur manufacturer annabella has its 
headquarters they carried a small coffin and shouted slogans such 
as a fur on your shoulders means blood on your hands 
the italian greens have proposed a law that would ban animal fur 
production sales and imports by january 1994 to help furriers 
convert their businesses a tax of 50 percent would be levied on 
furs bought before 1994 
italian furriers have accused animal rights groups of 
boycotting commerce a crime in italy with their antifur 
campaigns 
during march shows in milan for readytowear collections for 
fall and winter fendi italys most prestigious fur label showed 
coats and jackets with fur on the inside 
paola fendi head of the company said the intention was not to 
hide the fur from conservationists but simply to show one side of 
a reversible coat 
we are furriers and proud of it said fendi we introduced 
the reversible fur because it is a fashionable and practical 
solution for the traveling career woman 
many of frances and italys top designers such as dior yves 
saint laurent armani and ferre have created chic fake furs 
but these copies are not cheap they go for an average 3000

former president jimmy carter urged arab 
leaders saturday to reconsider the 1979 camp david peace accord 
between israel and egypt to reach a settlement in the arabisraeli 
dispute 
carter also said soviet jewish immigration to the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip would be an impediment 
to peace and expressed hope that a new government in israel will 
lead to israelipalestinian peace talks 
the governmentrun sawt ashshaab newspaper described carters 
visit to the middle east as a waste of time 
but carter declared if you go back now and reexamine the 
camp david agreement you would see that it provides a framework 
for peace 
his comments were made during an informal meeting with members 
of jordans parliament 
carter who brokered the 1979 israeliegyptian treaty said i 
dont maintain that the camp david accord is a perfect document 
but it can obviously be a binding document 
he noted that the israeli parliament had approved the camp david 
accord which includes the recognition of a un resolution calling 
for israeli withdrawal from the areas captured in the 1967 middle 
east war 
this was the first time israel ever approved resolution 242 
he said 
that resolution also calls for the right of all parties 
including israel to live in peace within secure borders 
the accord led to egypt becoming the only arab country to have a 
peace treaty with israel 
carter said arab leaders could select the parts they want from 
the agreement in light of the presentday circumstances 
israel continues to occupy the west bank and gaza strip and 
more than 600 palestinians have died since an uprising against 
israeli rule began in december 1987 
commenting on arab concerns over soviet jewish immigration to 
israel and the occupied zones carter said i share this concern 
with you 
to the extent that israeli officials are using the soviet 
jewish immigration to populate the occupied territories it is 
indeed counterproductive an impediment to peace and an unexcusable 
exploitation of the soviet jews who deserve support and peaceful 
existance and an opportunity to be free he said 
israeli leaders are expecting thousands of soviet jews to arrive 
in their country largely because of moscows easing of emigration 
rules 
israeli officials have repeatedly denied there is a government 
policy of settling soviet jews in the occupied lands and say only 
about 200 of 12000 soviet jews who arrived last year settled in 
the territories 
nevertheless the issue has alarmed arabs who fear they may be 
pushed out to make room for the new arrivals 
representatives of nine members of the organization of islamic 
conference met saturday in saudi arabia to discuss measures to 
counter the mass emigration 
the groups secretarygeneral hamid algabid said the influx 
of soviet jews will create major upheavals in the region change 
its demography undermine palestinian rights lead to the 
confiscation of more palestinian land the setting up of more 
settlements and strengthen the israeli military apparatus 
carter said soviet officials recently assured him moscow was 
contemplating a change in the soviet law to persuade jews to 
remain in the soviet union 
this includes allowing the return of hundreds of thousands of 
soviet jews who emigrate and allowing more religious and cultural 
freedom for jews carter said 
he spoke out in favor of convening an international peace 
conference on the middle east after the arabs and israel reach an 
adequate and mutual trust 
commenting on the fall of hardline israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs government and efforts to form a new 
administration led by rival labor party leader shimon peres carter 
said mr shamir has never been ready to sit and talk to 
palestinians 
labor are ready to advocate that a decision has to be made 
to begin talks with the palestinians he added 
shamir lost a vote of noconfidence in parliament last week over 
his refusal to accept compromises to get preliminary peace talks 
under way 
carter and his wife rosalyn flew in from syria on friday he 
will visit israel and the occupied territories sunday 
the visit tothe region is carters fourth since he left office 
in 1981

four years after ferdinand marcos ouster from 
power and six months after his death his widow goes to trial this 
week for her role in the alleged plunder of millions of dollars 
from the philippine treasury 
the racketeering case against imelda marcos begins tuesday with 
jury selection in manhattans federal court the testimony 
chronicling a tale of international intrigue and rich and famous 
players is expected to take months 
prosecutors will try to prove mrs marcos helped in the illegal 
transfer of more than 160 million allegedly obtained in the 
philippines through bribes kickbacks and embezzlement to buy four 
commercial buildings in manhattan 
mrs marcos 60 also is accused of defrauding banking 
institutions of more than 165 million in financing that real 
estate and of obstructing justice in a civil lawsuit filed by the 
filipino government to reclaim the properties 
the government has said her prosecution will not be affected by 
the death of her husband who was the central figure in the october 
1988 indictment marcos had been severed from the case because of 
ill health before he died sept 28 in exile in hawaii 
despite the paper trail that the government will follow the 
trial wont lack personality not when its central figure left 
behind 1060 pairs of shoes in the philippines wore a fulllength 
chiffon gown to her arraignment and who has friends like tobacco 
heiress doris duke to post her 5 million bail 
mrs marcos codefendant adnan khashoggi is somewhat of a 
celebrity himself the jetset saudi financier is accused of 
helping the marcoses hide their ownership of the properties through 
false documents he also is said to have been the main financier 
and middleman in the irancontra affair 
much namedropping is expected pretrial papers filed by 
prosecutors include correspondence between the marcoses and ronald 
and nancy reagan and mention of actor george hamilton as one of 
many unindicted coconspirators 
mrs marcos lead attorney gerald spence is sure to draw 
attention as the trial progresses spence of jackson wyo has a 
showy courtroom manner and a penchant for western attire 
he has been called a maverick for his choice of clients like 
the heirs of karen silkwood and for his books criticizing the 
criminal justice system 
in an interview spence said he felt the prosecution of mrs 
marcos was unfair in light of the close relationship she had with 
five us presidents during marcos 20 years in power marcos was 
ousted as president in 1986 after a popular revolt 
now suddenly these people become the enemies of this nation 
when its convenient and useful to do so spence said 
there couldnt be a more frustrated and lonely person in the 
world than a widow whos been charged with racketeering not only 
by her own government but by the government of the united states 
of america he said earlier in an interview in the jackson hole 
news of wyoming shes a helpless widow without many friends i 
want to be her friend i want to represent her 
he declined to preview his defense strategy or say whether mrs 
marcos would testify 
her lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to get the charges thrown 
out before the trial us district judge john keenan denied their 
claims that mrs marcos couldnt be prosecuted because she had been 
abducted to the united states after the 1986 revolt and because she 
had immunity on the grounds that her husband was a head of state 
earlier this year mrs marcos rejected a proposed plea bargain 
that attorneys said would have allowed for a suspended prison 
sentence attorneys in the case said negotiations broke down over 
the issue of how much money mrs marcos would have to forfeit as 
part of the plea bargain 
the governments case against mrs marcos was bolstered by the 
recent guilty plea of a codefendant rodolfo arambulo the former 
president of the los angelesbased california overseas bank 
prosecutors had alleged that the bank was partially owned by 
marcos and was involved in some of the illegal financial 
transactions arambulo whose plea to a lesser charge of conspiracy 
was hinged on his cooperation is a potential witness against mrs 
marcos 
the bank itself which was also to have gone on trial with mrs 
marcos on charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy 
pleaded guilty friday to wire fraud through its attorney the bank 
admitted that certain officers had opened fictitious accounts to 
enable transfer of funds to the united states from the philippines 
the plea did not specify who received the funds 
the specific charges to which mrs marcos has pleaded innocent 
are racketeering racketeering conspiracy obstruction of justice 
and mail fraud if convicted of all the charges she faces a 
maximum prison term of 50 years in prison and a 1 million fine 
under the racketeering laws prosecutors are seeking all 
property obtained through illegal activity for mrs marcos that 
includes the four new york buildings foreign bank accounts and 
other property interest she holds 
khashoggi who was a fugitive until his arrest in switzerland 
last summer had originally been charged with racketeering mail 
fraud and obstruction of justice 
but because swiss authorities declined to extradite him to the 
us on racketeering he is being tried only on the remaining two 
charges together they carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in 
prison and a 500000 fine 
five other people named in the indictment are fugitives they 
are bienvenido tantoco sr former philippine ambassador to the 
vatican his wife gliceria once president of a philippine 
department store their son bienvenido tantoco jr former 
california overseas bank chairman roberto s benedicto and karl 
bock peterson an associate of khashoggi

nelson mandela on saturday 
deplored recent black factional fighting that has left about 300 
people dead and said it indicated a surge in popular resentment of 
the apartheid system 
mandela returning from a fivenation foreign trip said that as 
soon as he is briefed by local black leaders about the wave of 
violence in black townships and tribal homelands we will go into 
action to stop it 
but he said the violence was clearly a rejection by blacks of 
the apartheid system and showed that the government policy of 
separating blacks into their own areas has no popular support 
whatsoever 
speaking at an airport news conference mandela also said he 
would not meet us secretary of state james a baker iii in south 
africa because a baker visit would indicate approval of the 
whiteled government 
mandela said he would be willing to meet baker elsewhere if 
the secretary of state wants to see me of course ill see him 
he said but i will not meet him in south africa 
baker has invited mandela to meet him in namibia the two are 
scheduled to attend the south african colonys independence 
celebrations wednesday 
baker then will go to cape town where he is scheduled to meet 
president fw de klerk other government officials and some black 
leaders 
we do not want any highprofile visits to south africa because 
these can result in a lot of confusion mandela said 
they suggest that president de klerk has done something 
positive something fundamental which requires the world to review 
sanctions and other strategies which we have invited in order to 
increase pressure on south africa he said 
de klerk won praise from many world leaders after he legalized 
the african national congress and 60 other organizations freed 
mandela from prison lifted some press restrictions reduced the 
influence of the military and desegregated the nations beaches 
after the news conference mandela attended a concert where some 
of the countrys top musicians sang a song composed in his honor 
the people want mandela waving a small anc flag he told the 
crowd of about 10000 that they should be grateful to the people of 
foreign countries who supported their cause over the years 
during his trip abroad mandela called for a cutoff of all 
diplomatic ties to south africa us officials and leaders of 
other nations say they believe diplomatic contact gives them more 
of a chance of influencing pretoria 
mandela has praised de klerk as a man of integrity but says the 
anc is not planning its strategy based on one man but on the 
policies of the national party government the government still 
denies the black majority the right to vote to choose where to 
live go to school or receive medical treatment 
mandela 71 was elected deputy president of the anc when he 
began his tour in zambia early this month he is the effective 
leader of the group while anc president oliver tambo recuperates in 
sweden from a recent stroke 
mandela said he will lead a delegation of internal and exiled 
anc leaders in talks april 11 with de klerk the talks are intended 
to clear obstacles to formal blackwhite negotiations 
de klerk has not met all the ancs conditions for formal 
negotiations they include ending the state of emergency freeing 
all political prisoners ending political persecution and 
guaranteeing the safe return of all exiles 
about 700 people many in anc colors gathered at a football 
stadium saturday at the edge of katlehong a black township south 
of johannesburg where 14 people have died in the past week the 
violence started as a dispute between taxi organizations 
twelve coffins of victims from both sides were draped in flowers 
and blankets in front of the grandstand as relatives huddled around 
them and speakers urged reconciliation

tens of thousands of iraqi protesters 
marched in the capital and other cities saturday to express anger 
at the british measures taken to censure iraq for hanging a 
londonbased journalist accused of spying 
president saddam hussein flew to saudi arabia for consultations 
with king fahd the official saudi press agency said fahd invited 
hussein after the international uproar over the execution of farzad 
bazoft the 31yearold iranianborn journalist worked for the 
observer a british sunday newspaper 
no details of their talks were released 
the official radio said demonstrators in all major iraqi cities 
swept through the streets chanting support for husseins decision 
bazoft was hanged thursday four days after a closeddoor 
revolutionary security court sentenced him to death he denied the 
charges of spying for israel and britain 
after the execution britain withdrew its ambassador expelled 
six iraqi military students and canceled all ministerial visits 
but it resisted demands to break off relations and impose economic 
sanctions 
residents in iraqs major port city of basra and in the northern 
city of mosul said thousands demonstrated against britain for what 
iraq called interfering in iraqs internal affairs and protecting 
spies 
speakers outside the besieged british embassy in downtown 
baghdad clamored for a tough position against the british 
colonialists 
officials of the ruling baath socialist party estimated that 
100000 people turned out in baghdad protesters carried placards 
praising the governments decision to hang bazoft 
no violence was reported 
demonstrators sent a cable to hussein urging him to take a 
tougher position against britain 
chop off the heads of all spies and silence their dirty 
tongues said the cable broadcast on staterun radio 
the report also said the protesters handed a letter of protest 
to the british embassy press officer expressing outrage over 
londons denunciation of the execution

community in baghdad there have been no reports of any trouble 
involving them 
schools and universities were let out for the day in baghdad and 
other cities so students could join the demonstrations 
the official radio and television suspended their normal 
programs to broadcast the protests and national songs praising 
hussein the radio also broadcast telegrams of support and 
solidarity from arab professional organizations and labor unions 
journalism should not be used as a camouflage for spying 
said a letter of support by the baghdadbased general federation of 
arab journalists 
the radio also broadcast statements of support by king hussein 
of jordan and salah khalaf a ranking member of the palestine 
liberation organization 
khalaf was quoted as saying the british protest amounted to 
interference in iraqs affairs while king hussein said iraq had a 
right to protect its national security 
bazoft was arrested in september along with british nurse daphne 
parish while he was investigating reports of a major explosion at a 
secret iraqi military research complex south of baghdad 
mrs parish was sentenced to 15 years in prison 
iraqi newspapers focused on barzofts criminal record in 
britain he served a year in prison in 198182 for robbing a 
savings and loan office of 764 while he was a student living in 
central england 
statecontrolled newspapers stepped up the antibritish campaign 
the governmentowned aljomhuriya daily declared in a frontpage 
editorial the british government should understand well that the 
iraq of saddam hussein is not an estate whose doors are open to 
spies and agents 
the demonstrations saturday were the first against a foreign 
mission since similar marches were organized against the us 
embassy in fall 1988 after the united states accused iraq of using 
chemical weapons against kurdish rebels 
residents in the embassy area recalled the protests against 
britain in july 1958 after the military coup that toppled the 
monarchy at that time protesters set fire to the same embassy 
building and ransacked it 
britain governed iraq under a league of nations mandate after 
world war i when the ottoman empire was broken up until 
independence in 1932 
history repeats itself but this time more quietly said an 
old man living near the embassy

factional and ideological splits loom 
large in illinois primary election tuesday as party leaders face 
tests of their onceunquestioned authority to name candidates for 
the fall election 
the democratic party wants to put two women on their statewide 
ticket for the first time and keep the patronagerich post of cook 
county board president in the hands of party regulars the partys 
slated candidates in those races face hotly contested primaries 
unheardof in the heyday of the late chicago mayor richard j daley 
i think ever since richard j daley passed from the scene 
theres been many people whove adopted an independent political 
course said rep william lipinski of chicago who has broken 
ranks with party leaders on key primary races 
daley died in 1976 after 21 years as chicago mayor his son 
richard m daley was elected mayor last year 
for republicans the election will measure the depth of a 
conservative insurgency against secretary of state jim edgar the 
gubernatorial candidate regarded by the party hierarchy as its best 
hope of retaining the executive mansion now occupied by retiring 
fourterm gov james r thompson 
strategists of both parties say the outcome of primary races may 
hinge on turnout state election officials this week predicted that 
little more than onefourth of the states 6 million registered 
voters would cast ballots 
our gut reaction is that it will be somewhat of a low 
turnout said gary lapaille a campaign organizer for democratic 
party regulars not one race has really charged democratic voters 
throughout the state 
wary that contested primary can be expensive and create 
lingering bitterness both parties have with few exceptions ensured 
their major candidates a clear shot at nomination for the fall 
election 
sen paul simon is unopposed in his primary as is his 
republican challenger rep lynn martin the winner of the 
republican gubernatorial primary will face attorney general neil 
hartigan a democrat who also is unopposed on tuesday 
democrats kept their primary relatively quiet in part by 
successfully challenging the nominating petitions of a slate of 
disciples of political extremist lyndon larouche four years ago 
two larouche disciples threw the party into turmoil with upset 
victories over slated candidates in the primary 
last fall party leaders sought to boost prospects for their 
statewide ticket by slating two female state legislators sen dawn 
clark netsch of chicago and rep peg mcdonnell breslin of ottawa 
for the state posts of comptroller and treasurer 
but state party chairman vince demuzio acknowledged that mrs 
breslin is an underdog in her race against patrick quinn a 
populist political activist and mrs netsch was locked in a 
fourway race with polls indicating few voters had made up their 
minds 
on the republican side edgar is being challenged by 
conservative political organizer steven baer 30 who has attacked 
edgars prochoice stance on abortion and his more moderate 
position on taxes another conservative physician robert marshall 
is conducting a lowprofile campaign 
a statewide poll earlier this month found 59 percent of voters 
favored edgar against 13 percent for baer 3 percent for marshall 
and 24 percent undecided the telephone poll of 637 registered 
voters had a 4point margin of error 
with the cast of characters largely set by both parties for next 
falls election much attention in the chicago area has been drawn 
to the democratic contest for the powerful post of president of the 
cook county board 
recent polls have indicated the frontrunners are richard 
phelan a chicago attorney who headed an ethics investigation of 
former house speaker jim wright and eugene pincham a black 
appellate court judge the candidate endorsed by local party 
leaders state sen ted lechowicz has been running last in the 
polls 
in cook county different factions are going different 
directions and that is part of the problem said state party 
chairman demuzio in the old days there was a lot of 
discipline 
chicago also is the scene of primary challenges to a pair of 
democratic congressmen gus savage and sidney yates both were in 
the toughest races of their careers with savage facing educator 
melvin reynolds and yates opposed by chicago alderman edwin

libya on saturday accused hostile intelligence 
services of causing the fire at a plant suspected of producing 
poison gas and it singled out the united states israel and west 
germany 
the official libyan news agency jana said a source at the 
countrys foreign ministry declared the plant was subjected to a 
terrorist sabotage operation which expressed organized state 
terrorism by hostile intelligence services causing a huge fire 
the blaze broke out wednesday at the plant in rabta about 60 
miles southwest of tripoli libya says the plant produces 
medicines but the united states and west germany have charged it 
produces poison gas 
following the blaze libya accused west germany of involvement 
the jana reports saturday however appeared to shift the blame to 
the united states 
both countries as well as israel have denied involvement in the 
fire president bush on saturday repeated this denial during a 
phone conversation with egypts president egypts middle east news 
agency reported 
president hosni mubarak initiated the call the staterun news 
agency reported it did not say which leader brought up the subject 
of the fire or whether bush volunteered the denial or made it in 
reply to a question from mubarak 
president bush assured president mubarak that he had 
nothing to do with what happened despite previously declared 
us objections to industries that might be related to chemical 
weapons the agency said 
jana monitored in rome said one of the aims of the cowardly 
act was to refute libyan assertions that the rabta plant produces 
medicines 
however this act on the contrary refuted the claims of 
america west germany and the zionists jana said 
it said the foreign ministry source whom it did not identify 
recalled the statements by the official spokesman of the american 
administration in which he did not rule out sabotage against the 
said factory 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater earlier this month called 
for the rabta plant to be shut down and said washington did not 
rule out a military strike at the factory 
the libyan source quoted by jana said the foreign ministry 
warns world public opinion of the dangers of repetition of such 
hostile acts by the american administration against the libyan arab 
people 
the official also was quoted as saying that colonial 
countries headed by the united states of america and the zionist 
enemy were exerting their utmost efforts to prevent arab countries 
from peaceful development including the production of medicines 
in a separate dispatch by its arab affairs editor jana also 
accused the united states of causing the rabta fire 
the editor said the american administration once it was sure 
that fire was set to alrabta pharmaceutical factory is 
directing now its usual claims against iraq 
he said he was referring to a us television report that said 
iraq was setting up a reactor for uranium production to make 
nuclear weapons 
a previously unknown organization purportedly representing 
libyan army dissidents claimed responsibility for setting 
wednesdays blaze in a telephone call to the cairo bureau of the 
west german news agency ard 
foreign correspondents have not been allowed into libya since 
the fire reporters were taken to the chemical plant in january 
1989 but not allowed to inspect it 
us officials have said the fire made the plant inoperable 
the united states attacked libyan forces three times in the 
1980s twice shooting down libyan fighter planes and bombing 
tripoli in 1986 for what former president reagan said was terrorism 
against americans in europe

a 500 million satellite that was launched 
less than a month ago to spy on the soviet union has started 
falling apart according to a soviet report that the pentagon on 
saturday refused to confirm 
the report by the novosti news agency said four orbiting 
fragments were spotted on march 7 that presumably separated from 
the american spy satellite 
a us space agency official said such fragments can be 
nonessential pieces such as protective shrouds but the 
washington post said members of congress and the intelligence 
community were told the satellite had suffered a malfunction 
there was disagreement in washington over the impact of such a 
loss of datagathering capability especially in light of eased 
tensions between the two superpowers 
should the satellite or pieces of it fall toward earth 
presumably over the soviet union they most likely would 
disintegrate in the atmosphere 
novosti said scientists who analyzed the orbits of the fragments 
believe the objects will fall to earth possibly over northern 
regions of the soviet union between monday and april 10 
the defense department spokesman james turner would not comment 
on the novosti or post reports other than to read a prepared 
statement 
space shuttle mission sts36 achieved its goal associated with 
a classified dod program the statement said hardware elements 
associated with the mission are expected to reenter the earths 
atmosphere we believe there is no risk to life or property 
the pentagon has never acknowledged that it sent a satellite up 
with the feb 28 launch of the atlantis shuttle but sources told 
the associated press during the mission that the secret cargo was a 
satellite capable of taking detailed pictures of the soviet union 
the radargenerated images a new technology can be obtained even 
through cloud cover 
the satellite which was cast into orbit march 1 also is 
designed to tune in on electronic communications all over the 
world sources said at the time 
the magazine aviation week and space technology reported in 
january that the satellite is a combination spacecraft carrying 
digital imaging cameras it reported that the signal receivers 
could intercept telephone radio and secure television 
transmissions in most populated areas of the soviet union 
sources said the satellite was launched at an inclination of 62 
degrees the farthest north ever for a shuttle mission the 60th 
parallel a roughly corresponding measure on earth passes through 
leningrad and most of the soviet unions population lies to the 
south of leningrad 
according to nasa spokesman charles r redmond the phrase 
hardware elements has a number of meanings it would almost 
depend on the satellite he said 
for example he said space tracking stations could detect the 
shrouds that provide protection for appendages such as solar 
panels antennas or remote sensors until after the satellite is 
launched from the shuttle 
redmond said it works to the advantage for reports of 
malfunctioning satellites to be believed he said that in past 
instances of such reports the military often has come back years 
later with data only the satellite in question could have gathered 
one intelligence official who the post said was briefed on the 
reported malfunction characterized it as a serious setback a 
member of congress who was briefed said the incident is of major 
concern but were not crippled by this by any means 
one congressional source told the associated press that the us 
datagathering capability has enough overlap to avoid any serious 
information gap if the satellite is indeed useless 
if you lost a couple in a row youve got a much more serious 
problem the source said adding that the more important role for 
intelligence now is to keep track of demobilization rather than 
possible threats 
another source disagreed saying that unlike the soviet union 
the united states does not build redundancy into its overhead 
surveillance system so when you lose one youve got a hole 
the source said 
if the satellite is lost there are others in that series the 
source said the launch schedule could be speeded up the source 
said 
the advances in satellite technology have led the united states 
to retire its fleet of premier sr71 spy planes known as 
blackbirds which had been in use since 1964 
critics of that decision say the planes are more versatile than 
satellites which are locked into specific orbits satellites can 
do similar work more cheaply defenders of the decision say 
if there is a malfunction it would be the second reported 
within a week the intelsat vi a commercial communications 
satellite failed to separate from its launch vehicle after liftoff 
from cape canaveral fla last wednesday 
the intelsat satellite had been trapped in a useless orbit that 
drew it perilously close to earth but engineers on friday managed 
to shift the satellites orbit enough so it is out of immediate 
danger of burning up in the earths atmosphere

britain on saturday welcomed a us offer to 
resettle half of all new vietnamese refugees who qualify for asylum 
the us decision was announced friday in london by jewel s 
lafontant the state departments coordinator for refugee affairs 
after two days of meetings aimed at reconciling differences with 
britain over hong kongs refugee problem 
the united states and other countries criticized britain for 
forcibly returning 51 vietnamese to hanoi last year from hong kong 
thousands of vietnamese are held in refugee camps there after 
arriving on boats 
britain had complained that those criticizing its refugee 
policies should offer to take some of the vietnamese to ease 
overcrowding 
mrs lafontant said that for the current fiscal year the united 
states had allocated 25000 admissions spaces to indochinese 
refugees from countries where they have gone for asylum and 26500 
spaces for refugees in the orderly departure program under that 
program vietnamese go directly to the united states from their 
homeland 
we will settle 50 percent of the new arrivals who are 
determined to be refugees she said the united states also will 
contribute 111 million to the un high commissioner for 
refugees she said britain has pledged 13 million she said 
hundreds of thousands of indochinese refugees fill squalid camps 
throughout southeast asia 
in the british colony of hong kong more than 40000 vietnamese 
took refuge during the last 18 months swelling the number in camps 
to 56000 as the sailing season begins this month thousands of 
new arrivals are expected at camps there and in malaysia thailand 
and elsewhere 
the foreign office said saturday it welcomes any offers to 
take refugees for resettlement but government sources speaking 
on condition they not be identified said the main problem is that 
more than 90 percent of vietnamese boat people in hong kong do not 
qualify as genuine refugees 
to qualify they must show they would be persecuted if they 
returned home british officials believe most want to leave vietnam 
for economic reasons 
britain favors mandatory return as a means of dissuading a new 
influx of refugees to hong kong 
it is the united states strongly held view that no one be 
sent back involuntarily mrs lafontant said 
a 10nation working group was set up to deal with the vietnamese 
refugees under the auspices of the unsponsored comprehensive 
plan of action a meeting of the group broke down in january over 
the issue of compulsory repatriation 
mrs lafontant said the united states was working hard to find 
a consensus that will preserve first asylum emphasize voluntary 
repatriation ensure fair screening procedures and provide adequate 
protection for asylum seekers in hong kong and for those returned 
to vietnam 
vietnams neighbors have on the whole shown great 
forebearance and generosity in affording first asylum to those 
seeking it she said adding the united states is doing its 
part 
mrs lafontant said the united states is asking other members of 
the group to donate funds to help the un refugee agency quickly 
screen applicants waiting in camps 
since 1975 the united states has given asylum to more than 
729000 indochinese australia has taken the secondlargest number 
more than 121000

investigators said saturday they 
have pinpointed a leak in a propane gas line near a bank wrecked by 
an explosion that killed three employees and injured 14 people 
the gas company salgas and its parent empire gas inc began 
excavating a twoblock section of line that was sealed off tuesday 
when high levels of propane were traced in the wreckage of the 
crested butte state bank 
authorities stressed they cant prove and may never be able to 
prove whether the rupture found in the propane line caused the 
blast which leveled the bank in this western colorado resort town 
march 6 
fire protection district manager mike miller said the obvious 
leak in the underground gas main was found friday night between the 
bank and an antiques store 
apparently the pressurized air drove propane from the 
saturated soils into the crawl space of the antiques store 
miller said he said the occupants of three adjacent buildings have 
been evacuated while the stores cellar is purged of residual gas 
local state and federal investigators believe a gas caused the 
explosion but are unsure which gas is to blame naturally 
occurring methane gas has been cited as a possible cause although 
no traces were found in the bank ruins or in holes bored 20 feet 
into the ground in the explosion area 
were drawing no conclusions about what caused the bank 
explosion miller said frankly im uncertain whether anyone 
can prove the cause definitively 
workers saturday found a ruptured coupling in the gas main about 
two feet under and one section of the pipe apparently had 
completely separated from the coupling miller said fire marshal 
rich largo ordered the coupling and 4 feet of the gas main cut out 
for further investigation 
a metallurgist possibly from the fbi will examine the pipe to 
determine if the coupling ruptured as a result of the explosion or 
if it was already broken when the blast occurred miller said

warsaw pact foreign ministers 
reflecting the new diversity of an alliance once dominated by 
moscow failed saturday to agree whether a united germany should be 
neutral disarmed or in nato 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze stood alone in 
ruling out nato membership for a united germany said czechoslovak 
foreign ministry spokesman lubos dobrovsky 
in comments to reporters shevardnadze stressed that the main 
question concerning a united germany is the level of armaments 
we ministers are all unanimous on one point that all states 
and not especially a united germany must be guided by the 
principle of a defensive doctrine that is to have that level of 
armaments and armed forces necessary only for their own defense 
shevardnadze said 
some people say its possible to keep germany in the system 
of nato we for instance think its impossible he said 
the meeting on the eve of east germanys first free elections 
reflected the growing divergence of east european nations casting 
off stalinist models 
participants glossed over the differences insisting the meeting 
was intended to discuss german unity and its impact on europe 
rather than to agree on complex new designs for the security of the 
worlds most armed continent 
despite the acknowledged disagreements some consensus emerged 
that nato and the warsaw pact while outmoded will exist for some 
time altered gradually by german unification and eastern europes 
dash to democracy 
czechoslovak foreign minister jiri dienstbier who with 
president vaclav havel advocates dissolution of both alliances 
fleshed out that vision in a speech proposing a paneuropean 
security agreement policed by a new european security commission 
the basis of the agreement should be that nobody can attack 
anybody else and that all signatories agree to provide aid 
including military help if any signatory does come under attack 
dienstbier told the closeddoor meeting his speech was later given 
to reporters 
at a news conference dienstbier said the proposal was well 
received but that the fluid situation in europe made it impossible 
to say when the 35 signatories of the 1975 helsinki final act could 
sign any new binding security accord 
the signatories are all european nations bar albania and the 
united states canada and the soviet union 
discussing the security alternatives for a united germany some 
nations said neutrality would be the worst alternative 
the soviet union by contrast has suggested neutrality as one 
way of allaying its traditional fears of germany 
neutrality would isolate germany and within a few years this 
would lead forward on a road which would not be good for europe 
polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski told reporters it 
could further some trends in germany to become a great power 
acting on its own 
dienstbier pleaded for germany to be deeply involved in european 
organizations saying the more a state is integrated the better 
it can be controlled 
the history of all warsaw pact states is intertwined with 
germanys evolution over the centuries from a cluster of 
principalities and dukedoms into a strong empire then a nazi 
dictatorship and now the potential 80million strong superpower of 
europe 
poland has been particularly concerned by the discussion in west 
germany over the possible absorption of former german territories 
now in western poland 
poland will be included in the unification talks between the two 
germanies and four world war ii allies when they discuss the border 
issue 
havel and dienstbier drawing on philosophies they developed in 
20 years of dissident opposition to the communists have 
consistently argued for the burying of traditional enmities in a 
new blocfree europe 
in his speech dienstbier stressed that the germans should be 
allowed to shape their own destiny warning that attempts to 
exercise pressure on this big nation may lead to the strengthening 
of extremist political trends and groupings 
stopping short of advocating total disarmament dienstbier 
suggested that a united germany reaffirm past declarations by both 
germanies never to acquire weapons of mass destruction

the states two large teachers unions 
on saturday urged striking teachers to end their 11dayold walkout 
after getting a pledge from legislative leaders to renew efforts to 
help education 
the tentative settlement which contains no promise of more 
money for the states 22000 teachers came after house speaker 
chuck chambers and senate president keith burdette pledged to work 
with gov gaston caperton and education representatives on a 
longterm plan for the states education system officials said 
the presidents of the 16000member west virginia education 
association and the 3000member west virginia federation of 
teachers announced the agreement saturday afternoon 
the walkout began march 7 and spread to all but a handful of the 
states 55 counties teachers had been threatened with mass firings 
and court action if they continued the strike 
weve moved education to the forefront so it just isnt 
asomething that you pay lip service to during elections said 
kayetta meadows president of the wvea at a news conference 
talks between the legislative leaders and the teachers began 
thursday after caperton said he would no longer negotiate with 
teachers because they had rejected his third offer for ending the 
walkout 
caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay raises 
is to increase taxes which he said the public opposes the 
teachers received a 5 percent pay raise earlier this year along 
with other public employees 
the teachers said they wanted more money and wanted lawmakers to 
address their benefits packages 
the state legislature adjourned thursday passing a budget that 
included no extra money for additional teacher pay raises it did 
however fully fund the states insurance program and teachers 
retirement system it also provided 27 million to help balance 
teacher pay from county to county 
we will either continue to argue over what has happened to 
public education in west virginia or begin to agree on what is 
needed to improve it the lawmakers joint statement announcing 
the settlement said 
the battle among teachers lawmakers and caperton had moved into 
the states courtrooms last week several circuit courts had ruled 
the strikes illegal and ordered teachers back to the classroom 
teachers in greenbrier and jackson counties had voted to return 
after local boards threatened to fire them and educators in other 
counties had votes scheduled for the weekend before the tentative 
agreement was announced 
this proposal and pending legal action are the reasons for 
wvfts decision to ask teachers to end the strike and return to the 
classroom said brown whose group represents 3000 teachers 
teachers should be proud of their solidarity while none of it 
was easy we stood together in commitment to our principles he 
said we walked out with dignity and in unity and we will return 
with dignity and in unity 
the wvea had rejected capertons offer of a 5 percent pay raise 
then rejected an offer for a special session saying it was too 
vague but on saturday the lawmakers promise to seek a special 
session was accepted 
the agreement announced saturday also was short on details 
meadows said no agenda has been set for the unions meetings with 
lawmakers and that no one has suggested how pay raises could be 
funded 
that is part of the plan that needs to be developed meadows 
said we havent set the agenda 
the agreement apparently was reached without discussions with 
the governors office 
if the result of the negotiations between burdette and 
chambers is a more positive atmosphere a more positive attitude on 
the part of the teacher representatives then were all for it 
said gc morse the governors spokesman 
its reasonably consistent with what the governor has beeen 
saying all along morse said he was amenable to a special 
session all along but largely objected to making commitments as a 
result of threats

a senior iranian official said in an 
interview published sunday that prospects for release of the 
western hostages in lebanon have never been better and that they 
may be freed this year 
ali mohammad besharati first deputy foreign minister told the 
tehran times newspaper i can say that all the hostages may be 
released by next january 
besharatis statement was the latest in a series about the 
hostages from ranking officials and the governmentrun media in 
tehran over the past month 
the moderate faction led by president hashemi rafsanjani says 
the hostage issue is moving toward a solution while the radical 
faction argues against releasing the captives 
the 18 western hostages are believed held by shiite moslem 
groups more loyal to the radicals than the moderates they include 
eight americans four britons two west germans two swiss an 
irishman and an italian 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who marked his fifth year 
in captivity friday most of the others have been held at least 
three years 
besharati who visited lebanon recently said he believes the 
chances for a hostage release are better than ever 
i saw the situation there and you know nothing is secret in 
lebanon on the basis of my observations i can say the chances for 
freedom for the hostages are brighter than at any time before he 
said 
he said he did not expect a mass release 
my analysis of the situation is that all the hostages may not 
be released at one time but gradually besharati said 
he stressed that iran had no direct link to the kidnappings 
the islamic republic of iran as it ha been repeatedly said is 
against the philosophy of hostage taking and tehran has no direct 
or indirect role in this matter he said 
an advance copy of the interview with the englishlanguage daily 
in tehran was provided to the associated press the same paper in 
two recent editorials called for releasing the hostages as an 
islamic and humanitarian action 
iran finances hezbollah a shiite moslem militia the radical 
groups holding the hostages are believed linked to hezbollah 
the radical faction in tehran eager to confront rafsanjani has 
encouraged the lebanese groups to continue holding the hostages and 
said iran should stay out of the matter 
rafsanjani has voiced support for releasing the hostages several 
times in the past and the tehran times usually reflects his views 
the moderate faction has sought improved ties with the west to 
help finance irans reconstruction in the wake of the 198088 
iraniraq war but the radicals consider ties with the west a 
betrayal of the ideals of the 1979 islamic revolution

german authorities bungled and then tried to 
cover up an investigation of a palestinian terrorist group they 
believe bombed pan am flight 103 over scotland 15 months ago 
according to a new book 
but the german operation codenamed autumn leaves is 
credited by authors steven emerson and brian duffy with arresting 
16 people linked to the group two months before the bombing 
possibly stopping plans for even worse terrorist attacks 
an explosion that investigators say originated in the luggage 
compartment of the boeing 747 airliner killed all 259 people on 
board the dec 21 1988 flight from london to new york and 11 
people on the ground in lockerbie scotland 
british investigators have concluded the bomb was made semtex a 
plastic explosive concealed in a radiocassette player put aboard 
another airliner that began flight 103 in frankfurt but they have 
filed no charges in the case 
emerson and duffys book the fall of pan am 103 published 
by g p putnams sons new york examines the bombing and its 
investigation by us british german and other authorities 
excerpts from the book appeared in sundays edition of the new york 
times magazine 
the authors say their conclusions are based on 250 interviews in 
the united states europe and the middle east many of their 
findings have been reported in less detail by us television 
networks and european newspaper and magazine accounts 
the book says investigators were convinced within days of the 
crash that the bombing was carried out at the behest of iran by the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine general command 
headed by palestinian terrorist ahmed jibril 
prior to the bombing all but two of the people linked to jibril 
in germany had been released including marwa khreesat a man 
previous reports have identified as the maker of bombs found by 
german authorities 
emerson and duffys book says khreesat may have been an 
informant for german and jordanian authorities and could also have 
been a double or triple agent reporting back to jibril german 
intelligence officials have denied that khreesat ever worked for 
them 
the germans let the alleged terrorists go because they thought 
they were not a threat to germany and because they included their 
own informants the book says 
german authorities also failed to find all of at least five 
bombs khreesat produced until several months after the bombing of 
flight 103 the book says a german police officer was killed in 
the dismantling of one bomb in april 1989 
until the officers death the germans attempted to cover up 
releasing members of jibrils group by being uncooperative with 
investigators from other countries looking into the bombing of 
flight 103 the book says 
investigators have linked the bomb aboard flight 103 to one of 
three alarm clocks purchased by accused terrorist hafez dalkimoni 
before his october 1988 arrest in germany according to the book 
they also believe a suitcase seen by a witness in khreesats 
possession may be the coppercolored suitcase that concealed the 
bomb aboard flight 103 
dalkimoni remains in custody but khreesat was released and the 
book says is believed to be in jordan 
the book says american law enforcement and israeli intelligence 
officials believe the bombs built by khreesat were intended to be 
used for mass murder on a scale even more terrible than 
lockerbie 
it says authorities have no hard evidence but believe the intent 
was to avenge the deaths of 290 people when a us warship shot 
down an iranian airbus over the persian gulf on july 3 1988 
that also leads to the conclusion that autumn leaves for all 
its evident failings may have inadvertently saved several 
hundreds if not thousands of lives the book says 
the authors also say western intelligence officials have 
reconstructed how the bomb was built with semtex smuggled from 
iran through an iranian diplomatic pouch to a terrorist safehouse 
in yugoslavia 
the barometric timers designed to trigger the bombs at a set 
altitude were built near damascus and smuggled to west germany on 
syrian airlines the book says

lithuanias president on saturday rejected a 
deadline set by moscow for renouncing the republics independence 
and appealed to democratic nations to recognize the newly 
declared state 
president vytautas landsbergis made the appeal a day after 
receiving a telegram from the kremlin giving lithuania until monday 
to renounce its selfproclaimed independence 
in a terse telegram friday president mikhail s gorbachev 
directed landsbergis in a threeday period inform about 
measures toward realizing this directive 
lithuania declared its statehood restored last sunday the 
soviet congress on thursday charged gorbachev with defending soviet 
interests and citizens in the baltic republic of 37 million 
it declared the lithuanian move illegal and maintained the 
soviet constitution was still valid there 
a telexed message issued saturday night by the lithuanian 
supreme council to western media and embassies in moscow indicated 
the new leaders did not plan to comply 
addressed to the governments of democratic nations it said 
recognition of lithuanias new status and government would be an 
important sign of political and moral support 
this we kindly request it concluded it was signed by 
landsbergis 
the new president also rejected the moscow deadline in remarks 
earlier saturday complaining that the soviet congress was treating 
lithuania like a naughty girl according to eduardas 
potashinskas a lithuanian tv editor 
landbergis also renewed his call for talks with the kremlin he 
said perhaps the telegram could be interpreted as the beginning of 
the negotiating process and we remember gorbachevs words about 
a dialogue with lithuania 
gorbachev told a news conference thursday night that he planned 
to have a respectful dialogue with the republics leaders and 
people 
he has not said what action he will take if lithuania does not 
respond within the threeday limit however the soviet leader and 
his advisers have ruled out the use of force to bring lithuania 
back into the union 
also at saturdays session of the republics legislature 
algirdas brazauskas the republics popular former president was 
elected to the post of deputy premier a former communist 
economist kazimira prunskene was named premier 
brazauskas had rejected the offer of the post of deputy premier 
last week but he accepted the position after a vote of 1223 in 
his favor 
brazauskas has held talks with gorbachev before and is 
considered likely to play a prominent part in any negotiations 
landsbergis told the supreme council the legislature that 
gorbachevs telegram appeared to be meant to pressure the 
leadership 
it can only be remarked that it was sent to the wrong address 
because we are no longer the supreme soviet of the lithuanian 
soviet socialist republic he was quoted as saying 
when the republic declared its independence its name was 
officially changed to the republic of lithuania and the supreme 
soviet legislature was renamed the supreme council 
on friday night the tass news agency quoted landsbergis as 
saying on television that moscow had no right to tell lithuania 
what to do 
it is not a problem that they do not recognize us now tass 
quoted landsbergis as saying the time will come and they will 
recognize us

on the eve of east germanys first free 
elections many members of the countrys small jewish community 
worried saturday that the social upheaval of recent months will 
revive antisemitism 
the situation could become dangerous said nazi death camp 
survivor oljean ingster the 62yearold cantor of the 200member 
jewish community in east berlin 
with growing unemployment we would expect attacks against 
foreigners and jews said ingster speaking after sabbath prayers 
in the red brick rykestrasse synagogue in east berlins bohemian 
prenzlauer berg district 
east berlins jewish population is only a fraction of what it 
was before world war ii and only five congregation members came to 
saturday services in a small sideroom of the synagogue which seats 
2000 it is the only of berlins 12 major jewish houses of worship 
to escape destruction by nazi mobs 
ingster wearing a black robe and velvet cap led the service 
with mournful chants of ancient hebrew prayers while a few of the 
worshipers rocked back and forth in devotion the three men had 
covered their heads with skull caps worn by observant jews and 
they had draped white fringed prayer shawls over their shoulders 
but with only one day to go before the election politics also 
entered the house of worship when the congregation engaged in a 
spontaneous debate before the service 
gysi is really not a bad guy but unfortunately he belongs to 
the wrong party ingster told a congregation member in the first 
row as the two debated for whom to vote 
ingster was referring to communist party chief gregor gysi who 
is popular with many east germans because of his refreshing wit 
the party which ruled the country for 40 years pledged democratic 
renewal after last falls popular revolt but is almost certain to 
be an opposition party after the election 
other congregation members said the pace toward a united germany 
was much too fast 
we dont know very much about the west and we have an uneasy 
feeling german unity will only create chaos said gertrud adam 
a slight woman in her 40s she said she considered east germany her 
home and didnt want the country to be forced into unconditional 
surrender to west germany 
ingster and others said that while they welcomed the new 
political freedom they were worried by the growing nationalistic 
sentiments and the emergence of rightwing extremist groups in 
several prodemocracy marches in recent months roving bands of 
neonazi skinheads have attacked leftist demonstrators 
ingster said that under communist leadership he had encountered 
only isolated incidents of antisemitism in general the communist 
leaders tried to keep a tight lid on antisemitic outbursts 
arguing that the new man created under socialism was incapable 
of bigotry ingster said 
throughout the communist years east berlins jewish 
congregation kept a low profile and the regime did not interfere 
with religious practices ingster said 
at the same time the communists did not offer support to revive 
jewish culture in berlin before the nazis came to power in 1933 
berlin was a thriving center of jewish life with about 170000 
jewish residents 
today an estimated 2500 jews live in east berlin including 
about 200 formally registered congregation members ingster said 
that many of the congregation members were holocaust survivors who 
returned after world war ii because they couldnt bear life in 
exile the east berlin congregation has not had a fulltime rabbi 
since 1965 
an estimated 6 million jews were killed by the nazis during the 
holocaust 
ingster who spent four years in sachsenhausen and other death 
camps said he stayed on because he was exhausted i needed time 
to catch my breath and then i realized i should stay to preserve 
what was left of the jewish congregation he said

president vaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia and polands solidarity leader lech walesa met in 
the mountains on their nations border saturday and pledged to work 
for european unity 
it was their first meeting and the locale is where the 
opposition of both countries forged friendship during the years of 
communist rule 
hundreds of czechoslovak and polish tourists swarmed around the 
helicopters that brought havel and walesa to the top of sniezka 
mountain for an afternoon of meetings organized by activists from 
both sides 
some now are members of the governments that took over when 
communists in poland and czechoslovakia were swept from power 
it is a good thing that these two men finally meet said 
bronislaw geremek a polish historian and leader of the solidarity 
caucus in parliament 
polish and czechoslovak flags decorated tourist hotels on both 
sides of the border where the meetings were held 
todays meeting on our common border is no accident this way 
we want to refer to the traditions of many years when poles 
czechs and slovaks often deprived of contacts used to meet here 
in the mountains in order to exchange experiences said a joint 
communique issued after the meeting 
it called on the nations to coordinate our strivings not only 
for democracy and order in our countries but also for our return to 
europe as a friendly union of free nations and democratic 
indepedent countries 
cooperation to reverse ecological damage from decades of 
industrial pollution and ways to deepen democracy also were among 
the issues walesa and havel discussed 
the two did not meet when havel visited poland in january and 
the meeting was organized to allow the men to exchange views on the 
future of europe 
walesa called the talks very fruitful and havel said he 
found the solidarity leader a nice and friendly guy 
members of the czechoslovak human rights movement charter 77 and 
the polish committee for the defense of workers began meeting in 
the mountains along the border during the late 1970s 
those meetings were interrupted by the 1981 martial law that 
crushed solidarity and landed many of the polish participants in 
jail at the same time havel and other czechoslovak activists also 
were serving time for political activities 
the polish border guards behavior had changed a lot from those 
days when they did their best to prevent the two sides from coming 
together one captain saturday presented the polish participants 
with badges giving them honorary membership in the border guards 
they also indirectly addressed the issue of german reunification 
by calling for a commitment to existing borders of europe 
poland has been seeking guarantees that once the german states 
unify the nation will respect the western border of poland and not 
try to regain territory ceded to poland after world war ii 
havel offered a clear vision of how he perceived the return to 
europe of countries repressed by postwar totalitarianism 
this unity should be characterized by the fact that smaller 
nations will not be afraid of bigger nations anymore and the big 
nations will not have to rival each other he told a news 
conference in a hotel on the polish side of the border 
he said he saw europe as a part of the world where unity and 
differences prevail as a continent which will not give the world 
wars but as a continent which will give the world peace 
havel and walesa also called for the full respect for the 
right of all nations to selfdetermination including 
reconstruction of statehood 
they were referring to republics in the soviet union which are 
trying to win independence from moscow

paris new hightech operabastille underwent what 
critics called a baptism by fire during its operatic debut 
saturday a sixhour performance of hector berliozs the 
trojans 
the french music world eagerly awaited the show as an ambitious 
and demanding test of the stateoftheart building the massive 
glassandsteel structure shaped like an ocean liner overlooks 
the capitals place de la bastille 
stages curtains podiums and other gadgetry are run by 225 
control drives and three computers using the computers stage 
hands are able to change scenery by remote control and lighting 
can be programmed into the computer during rehearsals 
south koreanborn myungwhun chung 37 is conducting the opera 
houses first production the cast features four americans shirley 
verrett grace bumbry gary bachlund and george gray 
the set design and costumes are the work of italian veteran 
pierluigi pizzi who has erected a giant trojan horse outside the 
opera house 
the building designed by canadas carlos ott was inaugurated 
in july with a gala concert at that time it drew mixed reviews 
for what some critics called its metallic acoustics 
some people close to the production say the first season should 
have been postponed another year so technicians could master the 
sophisticated equipment 
in an article before opening night the le monde daily called 
the operabastille a promising prototype delivered before 
trials it said it would become the technical marvel it was 
supposed to be in 10 years 
chung in comments before opening night called the trojans 
an extremely difficult work 
the only hope that i expressed to the musicians is that i hope 
we can be successful enough to be able to go on he told le monde 
chung was named artistic and musical director last spring after 
daniel barenboim was fired in a policy dispute 
according to president francois mitterrand who launched the 
project the new house was made modern and popular so opera 
would be more accessible to the masses opening night tickets cost 
between 650 and 60 half the price at the old palais garnier 
now used only for ballet 
unlike the ornate and obsolete garnier which had 400 seats with 
obstructed views the 2700 seats in the operabastilles main 
auditorium have clear views of the stage 
the auditorium a sleek design in black white and oak paneled 
walls contains two steep balconies it has seats with holes to 
let the sound pass through and an orchestra pit that can be lowered 
out of sight and covered 
the trojans has never been performed in paris in its 
entirety 
critics said reviving the work of berlioz a 19th century french 
composer was a good idea because he has been received better 
aboard than in his homeland 
a fulllength version of the trojans was performed for the 
first time in french at londons covent garden in 1969 under the 
direction of british maestro colin davis 
colin davis told me that it almost killed him chung said 
i thanked him for passing me the torch

former president jimmy carter urged arab 
leaders saturday to reconsider the 1979 camp david peace accord 
between israel and egypt to reach a settlement in the arabisraeli 
dispute 
carter also said soviet jewish immigration to the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip would be an impediment 
to peace and expressed hope that a new government in israel will 
lead to israelipalestinian peace talks 
the governmentrun sawt ashshaab newspaper described carters 
visit to the middle east as a waste of time 
but carter declared if you go back now and reexamine the 
camp david agreement you would see that it provides a framework 
for peace 
his comments were made during an informal meeting with members 
of jordans parliament 
carter who brokered the 1979 israeliegyptian treaty said i 
dont maintain that the camp david accord is a perfect document 
but it can obviously be a binding document 
he noted that the israeli parliament had approved the camp david 
accord which includes the recognition of a un resolution calling 
for israeli withdrawal from the areas captured in the 1967 middle 
east war 
this was the first time israel ever approved resolution 242 
he said 
that resolution also calls for the right of all parties 
including israel to live in peace within secure borders 
the accord led to egypt becoming the only arab country to have a 
peace treaty with israel 
carter said arab leaders could select the parts they want from 
the agreement in light of the presentday circumstances 
israel continues to occupy the west bank and gaza strip and 
more than 600 palestinians have died since an uprising against 
israeli rule began in december 1987 
commenting on arab concerns over soviet jewish immigration to 
israel and the occupied zones carter said i share this concern 
with you 
to the extent that israeli officials are using the soviet 
jewish immigration to populate the occupied territories it is 
indeed counterproductive an impediment to peace and an unexcusable 
exploitation of the soviet jews who deserve support and peaceful 
existance and an opportunity to be free he said 
israeli leaders are expecting thousands of soviet jews to arrive 
in their country largely because of moscows easing of emigration 
rules 
israeli officials have repeatedly denied there is a government 
policy of settling soviet jews in the occupied lands and say only 
about 200 of 12000 soviet jews who arrived last year settled in 
the territories 
nevertheless the issue has alarmed arabs who fear they may be 
pushed out to make room for the new arrivals 
representatives of nine members of the organization of islamic 
conference met saturday in saudi arabia to discuss measures to 
counter the mass emigration 
the groups secretarygeneral hamid algabid said the influx 
of soviet jews will create major upheavals in the region change 
its demography undermine palestinian rights lead to the 
confiscation of more palestinian land the setting up of more 
settlements and strengthen the israeli military apparatus 
carter said soviet officials recently assured him moscow was 
contemplating a change in the soviet law to persuade jews to 
remain in the soviet union 
this includes allowing the return of hundreds of thousands of 
soviet jews who emigrate and allowing more religious and cultural 
freedom for jews carter said 
he spoke out in favor of convening an international peace 
conference on the middle east after the arabs and israel reach an 
adequate and mutual trust 
commenting on the fall of hardline israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs government and efforts to form a new 
administration led by rival labor party leader shimon peres carter 
said mr shamir has never been ready to sit and talk to 
palestinians 
labor are ready to advocate that a decision has to be made 
to begin talks with the palestinians he added 
shamir lost a vote of noconfidence in parliament last week over 
his refusal to accept compromises to get preliminary peace talks 
under way 
carter and his wife rosalyn flew in from syria on friday he 
will visit israel and the occupied territories sunday 
the visit tothe region is carters fourth since he left office 
in 1981

opec ministers saturday renewed their 
efforts to keep crude oil prices up and their membership in line by 
agreeing to hold down production 
the ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries wound up six hours of talks by renewing support for a 
target price of 18 a barrel 
they also reaffirmed an earlier decision to carry into the 
apriljune quarter their production ceiling of just more than 22 
million barrels a day the cap was set in november for the first 
six months of the year 
however the 13nation cartel has been pumping up to 237 
million barrels a day according to analysts the overproducers 
include kuwait and the united arab emirates 
to meet the cap some of the countries would have to cut 
production 
we expect that we will withdraw some quantities from the 
market during the coming months said mines minister sadek 
boussena of algeria he was president of the meeting in vienna 
where opec has its headquarters 
this at least could avoid a decrease in the prices and stop 
the movement we noticed in recent weeks he told reporters 
the average price reached 2056 a barrel in the first week of 
january topping the 18 target opec reports since then the 
price has been slipping down in the second week of march to 1791 
a barrel 
most expect the price to fall further in the second quarter of 
the year demand for the cartels oil usually contracts with the 
warming weather in the united states and other consuming nations 
an opec report predicted demand would slump in the apriljune 
period to 208 million barrels a day before rebounding to 214 
million in the third quarter 
boussena said that if the countries abide by the stated 
ceilings prices will be at an acceptable level iraqs issam 
abdul raheem alchalabi predicted that prices will stay about 18 
west texas intermediate the american benchmark crude usually 
runs several dollars above the opec average it has been trading 
between 20 and 21 a barrel in recent weeks 
it was unclear what effect the cartels latest decision would 
have on production 
the united arab emirates will likely continue pumping about 2 
million barrels a day double its quota the emirates did not sign 
the november agreement setting the current production ceiling 
oil minister ali khalifa alsabah of kuwait has reportedly said 
his country does not have to abide by its quota when prices are 
above 18 
boussena insisted all opec countries except the united arab 
emirates would follow their supply limits they reaffirmed 
without any exception he said

hrawi it was formed in november to carry out a peace treaty 
brokered by the arab league countries to end the civil war which 
has claimed more that 150000 lives

it should have set a specific timetable for a complete pullout of 
syrian troops from lebanon the syrians who sent troops under a 
1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate now control most of the 
country 
aoun fought a round of battles last year with syrianbacked

the vatican newspaper urged greater 
international support saturday for soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev one of its most direct endorsements ever of his reforms 
in a frontpage editorial losservatore romano said the 
current phase of the complex soviet perestroika must be looked 
upon with a sympathetic eye particularly for the people and 
nations involved 
perestroika is gorbachevs program to restructure the soviet 
economy and society 
the newspaper said the creation of a presidentialrepublic form 
of government was a delicate task 
the presidential republic approved after great effort and for 
the moment more sketchy than definite in the necessary balances of 
power cannot however be summarily equated with a dictatorial and 
neostalinist disguise the editorial said 
gorbachev was elected president of the soviet union on thursday 
a day after the congress of peoples deputies approved his plan for 
a presidency with vast new powers 
some soviet progressives and observers from other countries have 
criticized the new system as giving gorbachev dictatorial powers 
the osservatore romano editorial said that every historical 
event and therefore also the one in the ussr develops its 
distinctive signs in its own rhythm and its own ways all 
together the last five years offer the image of a big wall that 
has been demolished by healthy blows 
the editorial came two days after the vatican and the soviet 
union established diplomatic ties for the first time since the 
founding of the communist state

judges subpoenaed italys antimafia commissioner on 
accusations he broke the law by overstepping his powers newspapers 
and stateowned television reported saturday 
the reports prompted an uproar and some politicians charged the 
move was aimed only at thwarting the work of antimafia 
commissioner domenico sica one of the countrys most prominent 
investigators of terrorism and organized crime 
the subpoena issued last week by a rome court but only reported 
saturday is the latest in a series of blows against sica some by 
the powerful national judges board 
the subpoena accuses sica of overstepping his powers and 
violating the rules of secrecy for investigations the commissioner 
could be put on trial if a further investigation produces enough 
evidence 
if found guilty he could be sentenced to five years in jail 
the charges are linked to an investigation last summer into a 
series of anonymous letters sent to italian politicians alleging 
that top judicial investigators abetted mafia figures who turned 
states evidence 
newspapers reported that during the investigation sica obtained 
the fingerprint of a judge suspected of writing the letters by 
giving him a drink and then having the print removed from the glass 
the subpoena charges that sica did not have the police powers 
required to take the fingerprint the newspaper and television 
reports said the subpoena also reportedly says sica violated 
secrecy regulations by discussing the investigation with 
politicians 
no comment was available immediately from sica who was 
appointed in august 1988 to revive the states fight against 
organized crime 
some politicians criticized the subpoena as an effort to 
diminish the commissioners powers 
i believe that in general there is an obvious maneuver to 
destabilize the office of antimafia commissioner said paolo 
ungari a leader of the republican party part of the fiveparty 
coalition governing italy 
carlo donat cattin the health minister and a member of the 
dominant christian democrats said the case reflected a war among 
mafias of magistrates more than a war against the mafia 
but some other politicians said the case illustrated that judges 
were overstepping their authority in their investigations of the 
mafia in italy judges have traditionally done a large amount of 
the investigative work in criminal cases 
the subpoena of sica was the latest setback for italys fight 
against organized crime a battle that has been mired in scandals 
since the conviction of 338 people in a major organized crime trial 
in 1987 
early this month a judge caused a furor by telling a television 
interviewer that he and two colleagues had been removed from sicas 
office because the commissioner was about to arrive at the attic 
of the skyscraper of the mafia in other words top politicians 
linked to the mob 
italys national judges board the superior council of 
magistrates rejected the charges it said it removed the three 
assistants last february because sica had been assigned detective 
rather than judicial jobs 
the episode came after a leading judge criticized sica for 
ordering the tapping of hundreds of telephones a practice rarely 
allowed by italian law 
during his judicial career sica has investigated most of 
italys major terrorism cases ranging from the kidnapping and 
killing of former premier aldo moro in 1978 to the 1981 shooting of 
pope john paul ii 
he also worked on organized crime investigations including one 
into the pizza connection herointrafficking ring controlled by 
italian mafia and us mob figures who operated in the northeastern 
and midwestern united states

a woman who investigators say was the high 
priestess of a mexican drug cult that sacrificed 15 people last 
spring says she had nothing to do with the deaths and that police 
have tortured her 
sara aldrete villarreal 25 is also accused of ordering the may 
6 slayings of 26yearold cubanamerican adolfo de jesus constanzo 
the alleged godfather of the cult and his bodyguard as police 
closed in on their hideout 
authorities say constanzo had overseen the ritual killings of 
the 15 men and boys including a university of texas student at a 
ranch outside matamoros in april telling his followers the deaths 
would give them spiritual protection from police 
police say ms aldrete took part in at least one of the ritual 
killings selecting the victim and supervising his murder 
its not true its just not true and im fed up with saying 
it ms aldrete said in a recent interview with the dallas times 
herald in mexico city 
she said mexican police tortured her immediately after her 
capture poking her with electric prods and hanging her from 
ceiling pipes by her handcuffed wrists ms aldrete said 
she said she was also taken to the morgue where autopsies were 
being performed on constanzo and martin quintana his bodyguard 
police forced her to touch the eviscerated bodies she said 
they said ok here is your god and they said get up 
god arent you going to help sara ms aldrete told the 
newspaper 
because mexican law requires that a judge rule on the case 
within a year of the suspects arrest a ruling in the constanzo 
murder case is expected before midmay ms aldrete faces a 
possible 40year maximum sentence on a murder charge 
under the mexican judicial system the accused is guilty until 
proven innocent the trial is an administrative process that allows 
a judge to review evidence presented by defense attorneys and 
prosecutors 
in addition to the possible 40year prison term ms aldrete 
could be charged in matamoros and extradited to the united states 
to face related charges in the ritual slayings 
ms aldrete told the newspaper she met constanzo in matamoros in 
august 1987 they began a romantic relationship that ended several 
months later when constanzo told her about the male lovers he also 
had 
i knew that adolfo was a white witch ms aldrete said i 
used to respect his religion and he used to respect mine which 
she said was roman catholicism 
at the beginning he was a good guy who cared about people but 
then he changed and he was no longer the man i used to know he was 
out of control 
ms aldrete claims constanzo kidnapped her in march and fled 
matamoros just before the bodies were discovered in early april 
she said she was sometimes bound and gagged during the month 
constanzo and his gang hid in and around mexico city 
but police maintain ms aldrete at constanzos request ordered 
gang member alvaro de leon to kill constanzo and his bodyguard at a 
mexico city apartment 
ms aldrete claims police killed the two men she also says she 
wrote the note that led police to constanzos hideout

before the april 25 inauguration ortega who was voted out of 
office feb 25 leads the leftist sandinista government that the

a secret government inquiry into the research of 
americas leading aids scientist uncovered evidence that he was not 
the first to discover the deadly virus as the united states has 
claimed a newspaper reported 
but an internal report issued by the national cancer institute 
after the inquiry failed to mention the evidence and concluded that 
the institutes dr robert c gallo was the first to discover the 
aids virus the chicago tribune reported in its sunday editions 
as a result of the omission legal briefs filed by the 
government in the us court of claims and before the patent and 
trademark office contained repeated misstatements of fact about 
gallos research the tribune said 
the secret inquiry conducted by national institutes of health 
concluded that instead of discovering the aids virus gallo may 
have discovered the offspring of a sample virus sent to him by 
french scientists the newspaper reported 
the national cancer institute is part of nih which is run by 
the us department of health and human services 
the 10page internal report was prepared in late 1985 by a 
senior institute official for use in defending the government 
against legal actions by the french the newspaper reported it was 
signed by dr peter j fischinger then associate director of the 
cancer institute and submitted to health and human services 
officials the tribune said 
the tribune said it obtained fischingers report and the other 
documents from an unnamed source fischinger gallo and the us 
justice department either didnt answer requests for interviews or 
declined to be interviewed the newspaper said 
previously gallo said of the inquiry i have done nothing 
wrong and i have no apprehension or anxiety about the review 
gallo and his colleagues were once considered independent 
codiscoverers of the aids virus along with drs luc montagnier 
jeanclaude chermann and others at the pasteur institute in paris 
the french were first to publish information about their virus 
which they called lav in may 1983 but the finding was largely 
ignored because it was from one isolated case of an aidsrelated 
disease 
the gallo group maintained it was the first to isolate study in 
detail classify and definitely link a similar virus called 
htlv3 with aids this work was published in four papers in the 
may 4 1984 issue of the journal science 
the french later charged that gallo and his assistants by 
accident or design had claimed the french virus as their own 
the french institute sued the us government in december 1985 
claiming it wrongly granted americans the patent on a test to 
detect aids antibodies the french said they had developed the test 
first and first applied to patent it 
the us government in march 1987 settled out of court with the 
french both sides agreed that the pasteur institute has the right 
to sell its aids test in this country and that the two sides would 
share royalties from the us aids test 
fischingers report along with other documents obtained by the 
tribune indicates that dozens of legal claims by the us 
government were unsupported by gallos lab records they included 
that genetic evidence conclusively established that the 
gallo aids virus was an independent isolate and not the same virus 
the french had sent him 
that gallo had actually discovered the virus a month before 
french researchers at the pasteur institute but had withheld news 
of the discovery for more than a year 
that because gallos lab was the first to develop a blood test 
that could detect infections with the aids virus the lucrative 
patent on the test belonged to the us government and not the 
french

resulted in the seizure of 2200 pounds of cocaine in california 
and central america and the arrests of nine people linked to 
colombias medellin cartel authorities said 
the drug enforcement administration said a central american 
country it would not identify helped confiscate 1210 pounds of 
cocaine bound for san francisco on friday authorities in the same 
operation seized 990 pounds of cocaine 13 days earlier 
the central american country cannot be named for fear of 
jeopardizing future operations there said agent robert bender he 
estimated the street value of the confiscated cocaine at 100 
million 
these are significant players in the medellin organization

francisco street and convinced him they could transport and 
distribute large quantities of drugs

the first shipment from peru to a central american landing strip 
where the drugs were loaded onto a plane controlled by the dea 
and flown to howard air base in panama bender said 
unknown to the traffickers the cocaine was transferred to a 
us military aircraft and flown to moffett field south of san 
francisco he said agents loaded the drugs into a rented truck 
drove it to san francisco and showed the goods to noriega to 
convince him they were capable of importing large amounts of 
cocaine 
those arrested face federal charges of conspiracy to import the 
drug agents said penalties range from 10 years to life in prison 
and fines up to 4 million 
agents arrested five people at a hotel near san francisco 
international airport bender said besides noriega they were 
identified as jamie uribe 68 of colombia carlos guerriero 36 
of colombia frank emilio dela campa 34 of cuba and david edward 
villegas 39 a us citizen whose hometown was not given 
rosanna patricia targler 26 of peru was arrested in fort

business leaders and economists 
said saturday they fear president fernando collor de mellos 
antiinflation package will strangle the economy and plunge the 
country into a deep recession 
the imprisonment of the wealthy will not liberate the poor 
said paulo rabello de castro an economist of the respected 
gertulio vargas foundation this could well cause general 
shortages of goods and services 
collor who took over thursday and became brazils first 
popularly elected leader since 1960 announced his economic plans 
the next day 
the measures include price controls a new currency a 
devaluation and a crackdown on financial speculators they are 
intended to halt 2700 percent annual inflation and restart 
brazils stagnant economy 
most of the economic reforms were sent to congress as 
provisional measures which take effect immediately but can be 
put to a vote within 30 days they also become null if congress 
fails to call a vote within that period 
the backbone of the package a severe tightening of the money 
supply sharp rises in taxes and utility costs and cuts in 
government subsidies and tax incentives prompted fears of worker 
layoffs and a plunge in economic activity 
under the plan withdrawals from savings accounts will be 
limited to the equivalent of about 1200 businesses and citizens 
with greater savings will only be allowed to withdraw their money 
after 18 months 
it was still not clear if businesses could pay bills and 
expenses with the frozen funds further adding to anxiety 
similar rules apply to key shortterm deposits the government 
uses to finance its 31 billion federal budget deficit those 
accounts have paid interest rates of up to 105 percent a month but 
withdrawals will now be limited to about 600 
i dont know up to what point the economy can be supported 
without liquidity said teofilo orth president of the brazilian 
association of industrial development 
economists also expressed fears that the lack of money in 
circulation would disrupt the commercial supply chain across this 
nation of 150 million 
several businessmen expressed doubts they would have enough 
liquid funds to pay workers salaries 
the measures will be felt hard by middle and upperclass 
brazilians who provided much support for collor during the 1989 
presidential campaign the plan ties up their pay for vacations 
homes or automobiles for 18 months 
middleclass brazilians were already grumbling on saturday 
its frustrating you save a little to try to get ahead and 
they lock your money away in the government safe said sebastiao 
freitas gomes a 27yearold computer analyst in rio de janeiro 
public service and utility increases decreed friday added to the 
anger fuel prices went up 56 percent telephone rates 32 percent 
postal rates 80 percent electricity 32 percent and air fares 50 
percent 
labor minister antonio rogerio magri defended the measures in a 
nationally televised interview saturday 
i can guarantee the working man will not suffer by these 
measures the big financial speculators those who invested in gold 
and dollars and not in brazil will pay he said 
but labor unions representing more than half of brazils 60 
million workers said the slowdown would lead to mass firings and a 
drop in real wages 
the economy will stop said jair meneguelli president of 
the leftist central workers union the nations largest and if 
workers lose their jobs a general strike will be a way of fighting 
back that will be considered 
many brazilians also seemed confused by the measures residents 
expressed dismay at the fourth currency change in four years 
first we had cruzeiros then cruzados then new cruzados and 
now back to cruzeiros said anaide de soares a 24yearold 
saleswoman in a rio clothes shop its hard to trust leaders who 
play with your money and raise the price of everything

the states two largest teachers 
unions under legal pressure to return to work urged striking 
teachers to end their 11dayold walkout saturday after gaining a 
promise of cooperation from legislators 
the agreement came after house speaker chuck chambers and senate 
president keith burdette said they would recommend that gov gaston 
caperton call a special legislative session to address teacher pay 
and longterm education needs 
the tentative settlement contained no promise of more money for 
teachers who had faced increasing pressure to call off the strike 
several circuit courts had ruled it illegal and ordered teachers 
back to the classroom 
in addition the state supreme court scheduled arguments for 
tuesday on the legality of a statewide backtowork order issued by 
a kanawha county circuit judge 
the settlement was announced saturday afternoon by presidents of 
the 16000member west virginia education association and the 
3000member west virginia federation of teachers 
this proposal and pending legal action are the reasons for 
wvfts decision to ask teachers to end the strike and return to the 
classroom said bob brown president of the smaller union 
weve moved education to the forefront so it just isnt 
something that you pay lip service to during elections said 
kayetta meadows president of the wvea 
under the agreement if teachers return to work monday 
lawmakers and union leaders would begin work on a plan to improve 
the states education system by improving pay benefits and 
teaching conditions 
once a plan is developed it would be submitted to a special 
legislative session for approval before the start of the 199091 
school year meadows said 
the walkout which affected twothirds of the states 22000 
teachers began march 7 teachers who received a 5 percent pay 
raise a month ago said they wanted more money and lawmakers to 
address their benefits packages 
in earlier bargaining the wvea rejected capertons offer of a 5 
percent pay raise then rejected an offer for a special session 
saying it was too vague but on saturday the lawmakers promise to 
seek a special session was accepted 
our state has been bitterly divided over this strike and the 
healing process must begin chambers and burdette said in a joint 
statement issued saturday 
the announcement of the agreement gave few details meadows said 
no agenda has been set for the unions meetings with lawmakers and 
that no one has suggested how pay raises could be funded 
that is part of the plan that needs to be developed meadows 
said we havent set the agenda 
under the agreement teacher groups in each county will decide 
individually whether to return meadows and brown said 
my recommendation will be for them to go back in but continue 
their campaign to inform the public and to watch what the 
legislature does said michael gonzales president of the 
mcdowell county education association his group scheduled a vote 
sunday 
teachers in greenbrier and jackson counties had already voted to 
return after local boards threatened to fire them educators in 
other counties had votes scheduled for the weekend before the 
tentative agreement was announced 
word of the settlement trickled slowly to the states teachers 
pete rohal a teacher in hancock county said he wasnt ready to 
return to work blindly 
ill have to see what the package has he said 
the agreement was reached without discussions with the 
governors office meadows said the governors spokesman however 
welcomed the news 
its reasonably consistent with what the governor has beeen 
saying all along said spokesman gc morse said he was 
amenable to a special session all along but largely objected to 
making commitments as a result of threats 
caperton had said in three previous offers to end the strike 
that he wouldnt call a special session as long as teachers 
remained on strike 
if the teachers return the wvea and the federation of teachers 
plan to meet with burdette and chambers during the week meadows 
said 
we believe the plan will be completed prior to the beginning 
of the school year she said 
talks between the legislative leaders and the teachers began 
thursday after caperton said he would no longer negotiate with 
teachers caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay 
raises is to raise taxes which he said the public opposes

a senate filibuster blocking action on a 
bill that would liberalize the states abortion law entered its 
third day saturday with no end in sight 
three votes were needed to end the filibuster by antiabortion 
legislators and one senator who had been expected to vote to close 
the debate said saturday he has changed his mind 
the bill blocked by the filibuster would replace a relatively 
restrictive 1968 law that hasnt been enforced since the supreme 
courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling supporters of the bill want a 
prochoice replacement for the 1968 law in case the high court 
overturns roe vs wade 
the proposed law would allow unrestricted access to abortions 
until the fetus is able to survive outside the womb abortions 
after the fetus is viable would be prohibited except to save the 
life of the mother or to protect her physical or mental health 
state sen john n bambacus who previously had said he would 
vote for cloture said he changed his mind after learning the law 
would allow postviability abortions to save the mothers life a 
clause added as an amendment 
he described the amendment as a mortal strategic error on the 
prochoice side

a building leased by the federal drug 
enforcement administration was gutted by a large firebomb thrown 
through a window early saturday authorities said there were no 
injuries reported 
investigators from several federal agencies were working 
together to identify suspects in the 230 am bombing but refused 
to say whether they had any 
abc news reported saturday night that a man indicted last week 
in a drug case had threatened to destroy the office in this 
southwestern florida city on the gulf coast 
to my knowledge weve never had an office of the drug 
enforcement administration destroyed in such a fashion dea 
spokesman tom cash said from the scene i think that obviously we 
have been targeted thats rather plain and rather clear 
frank shultz a washington dc spokesman for the federal 
agency quoted the fire marshal in fort myers as saying the fire 
was started by a large incendiary device thrown through a 
window 
the fire caused by the bombing gutted the 6000squarefoot 
onestory building at a shoppingbusiness mall agency officials 
said damage was estimated at 4 million the drug agency was the 
only tenant in the building 
three hours before the explosion a car bombing was reported in 
a residential area in south central fort myers said sheri 
peterson a spokeswoman for the lee county sheriffs office she 
did not have details and could not say whether the two bombings 
were related no injuries were reported 
john fernandes dea spokesman from the miami field office said 
federal agents were investigating numerous possibilities to 
determine who carried out the firebombing 
it could be one of many individuals he said if you look 
at the productivity of the fort myers office theyve been 
knocking them dead lately were checking all the most recent 
indictments 
on thursday a federal grand jury indicted three men and a woman 
from fort myers beach in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine the 
woman 20yearold kelly susskind was arrested along with 
41yearold kenneth bird the other two brothers identified by 
police as 23yearold jeffery matthews also known as jeffery 
ciganek and 20yearold john ciganek were still at large 
federal officials did not immediately link that case to the 
explosion but acknowledged that is one of many cases under 
scrutiny dea agents planned to issue a nationwide alert for 
suspects and were showing mug shots from the drug conspiracy case 
nbc news reported 
several agencies were involved in the probe including the fbi 
dea the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms as well 
as state and local agencies an fbi forensics team including 
explosives experts from washington dc was brought in to search 
the crime scene 
although the records at the office were destroyed authorities 
said there are copies at other locations 
this is an act of desperation said fernandes who was in 
fort myers to handle inquiries if they think this is a setback 
for us its not this shows were on the right track 
we are officeautomated so a lot of what we put on paper we 
also put in computer a lot of what you think we would lose we 
have duplicated copies of fernandes said 
the second bombing may have been just a diversion he said

the bush administration will propose cuts in the 
1991 military budget of 10 billion or 11 billion nearly triple 
what the white house had originally proposed according to a 
published report 
the higher cuts are almost as large as those urged by many 
congressmen the new york times said in sundays editions 
if no cuts were made the 1990 military budget of 296 billion 
would go up to about 306 billion next year as a result of 
inflation and previous commitments 
in january the administration proposed cutting 32 billion 
from the 306 billion outlay 
but that figure was dismissed as far too small even by 
republican conservatives like sen john mccain of arizona 
the fact is that we all know beyond any possible doubt that 
the soviet union isnt about to launch an attack mccain told the 
times 
he said bushs original defense spending proposals did not 
reflect the demise of communism in eastern europe and the end of 
the cold war 
the administration apparently revised the proposed cuts because 
officials realized they would have to give considerable ground to 
win approval from congress for the military budget the times said 
quoting senior government officials 
congressional democrats and even some republicans have advocated 
reductions of about 12 billion or 13 billion 
all savings would be applied toward the overall 1991 
deficitreduction target of 36 billion in the

a new indictment against medellin 
cocaine cartel leaders details the vast financial network they 
allegedly used to hide between 60 millon and 100 million in drug 
profits in bank accounts worldwide 
assistant us attorney ernst d mueller said the new 
indictment which supersedes a previous indictment in the socalled 
son of lehder case lists 20 defendants 19 of whom are still 
fugitives 
federal prosecutors have frozen accounts worldwide of cartel 
leader jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha who maintained more than 70 
accounts in seven foreign countries from 1984 until his death in 
december mueller said 
the indictment which was filed jan 26 but remained sealed 
until thursday said gachas accounts were listed under corporate 
names of transcontinental traders union enterprises and first 
interstate ltd those accounts mueller said contain between 60 
million and 100 million 
the big thing is to immobilize the funds and not let the 
druggers have them mueller said 
much of the financial information was obtained when colombian 
officials raided a ranch house belonging to gachas nephew in yari 
colombia in october mueller said the prosecutor said he didnt 
know if the money would be forfeited saying that was a secondary 
thing 
gacha carlos lehder rivas pablo escobar gaviria jorge ochoa 
vasquez and fabio ochoa vasquez joined in the 1970s to create the 
medellin cartel which is believed to account for 80 percent of the 
cocaine smuggled into the united states 
lehder was convicted in jacksonville in 1988 and sentenced to 
life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 135 years 
the son of lehder case indictments came from information 
learned by prosecutors during his 7monthlong trial in a trial 
last fall involving five people indicted in the case three men 
were convicted and two were acquitted 
each of the cartel leaders was named in the son of lehder 
indictment last year and are included in the new superseding 
indictment 
the new indictment was unsealed when one of the new defendants 
john d liebolt surrendered to us marshals at the federal 
courthouse in jacksonville

accounts from 1984 until his death on dec 15

was used to transport cocaine into the united states in 1978 he 
faces conspiracy charges 
liebolt had been hiding in new york since he was indicted last 
june under the previous son of lehder indictment mueller said 
he has pleaded innocent us magistrate harvey e schlesinger set

ousted

impression on me

experiences and changes nothing surprises me anymore

representatives of greyhound and its 
striking bus drivers haggled all day over a union proposal 
saturday but reported little progress in their first meeting since 
the violent 2weekold strike began 
negotiations began at midmorning and recessed saturday night 
with promises from both sides to meet again in the morning 
its late were tired nothing has happened said greyhound 
executive vice president anthony lannie 
he said the intercity bus company had not yet responded to a 
proposal presented earlier saturday by unions representing the 
striking workers 
union officials said their proposal involved a 40 million 
threeyear package that included modest pay increases of 45 
percent and the addition of new drivers to the pension plan 
ed strait president of amalgamated council of greyhound local 
unions said the talks were progressing very slow very slow 
we expected this 
a union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that 
included no guarantee of any pay hikes but would have made raises 
contingent on increased profits and ridership 
the company rejected an offer to bring in number crunchers 
from both sides and see if a compromise could be worked out said a 
union representative 
federal mediators are with company officials and union 
negotiators here in the first facetoface meeting since 6300 
drivers and an estimated 3000 other greyhound workers walked out 
march 2 over wages job security and grievance procedures 
greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service 
and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for which 
buses are the only public transportation 
since the walkout began there have been at least 14 shooting 
attacks on greyhound buses 46 bomb threats and numerous other 
incidents of vandalism or threats greyhound officials said 
both sides reserved expectations for talks saturday because of 
the incidents but were willing to get together 
i guess the best way to characterize my feeling is that i have 
high hopes but very low expectations greyhound lines inc 
chairman fred g currey said friday 
currey has repeatedly said that greyhound can afford no more 
than the 63 million threeyear contract it first offered 
jeffrey nelson spokesman in washington for the amalgamated 
greyhound unions has said the two sides are not that far apart 
on financial aspects but differ on grievance procedures 
the company says it has been operating roughly onethird of its 
buses with replacement and nonstriking drivers the company says 
394 union drivers are at work joining 1002 permanent 
replacements the union says only 94 of its drivers have crossed 
the pickets lines 
meanwhile in washington state a judge has issued a restraining 
order limiting pickets or nonpicket demonstrations to 20 persons 
within 20 feet of any greyhound lines inc facility entrance or 
exit in the state 
king county superior court judge terrence a carroll ruled 
friday that there had been vandalism of greyhound property and 
attempts to harass or impede the companys buses on highways

a terrorist group has claimed 
responsibility for the fatal crash of two us helicopters and the 
bombing of a discotheque and it threatened more attacks on 
americans and us property 
the group calls itself the dec 20 movement or m20 and is the 
first terrorist group to surface following the dec 20 us 
invasion that overthrew military dictator manuel antonio noriega 
one us soldier was killed and 16 american military personnel 
and 12 panamanians were injured in the grenade attack on the 
discotheque march 2 
the us southern command said the feb 21 helicopter crashes 
near colon at the northern end of the panama canal killed 11 
soldiers and it blamed the crashes on bad weather 
the dec 20 movement claimed in a handout distributed friday in 
the western city of david that 30 soldiers died 
it was not an accident as they have said it said 
the us southern command made no comment on the statement 
officials of the government of president guillermo endara 
installed at the start of the invasion have said pronoriega 
groups were known to exist and were likely to have access to large 
weapons caches believed still hidden in the country 
witnesses said men who threw the grenade at the disco yelled 
viva noriega 
government and justice minister ricardo arias calderon said 
authorities did not have enough information to confirm m20 was 
responsible for the bombing he said it also appeared to involve a 
dispute among drug traffickers 
rosendo samudio bonagas a member of the small communist party 
of the people was arrested friday in david for handing out the 
fliers and authorities said they were seeking two others panama 
city newspapers reported saturday 
we will attack everything we find in our path especially 
property of the united states the flier said we will avenge 
our dead a soldier dressed in civilian clothes or in uniform 
will be executed 
our principal objective is everything that smells of gringos 
we ask panamanians not to go around with them because they will be 
in danger 
it also threatened to attack vehicles with homosexual signs of 
just cause the military name for the us invasion and said 
we will do the same with those who applauded the cowardly 
aggression 
most panamanians welcomed the invasion and new government but 
officials say discontent could build quickly in the large ranks of 
unemployed 
about onethird of the work force of 650000 is jobless 
officials say 
m20 also threatened the david international fair which opened 
friday and endara and president oscar arias of costa rica calling 
them personalities of the yankee embassy the presidents 
canceled a planned meeting at the fair apparently for reasons 
unrelated to the threats 
the agricultural and crafts fair promotes trade in the region 
early this week 75 truckloads of soldiers in combat gear went 
to david to help provide security for the event

a luxury highrise apartment complex that 
received federal backing on a 1589 million mortgage loan is 
delinquent and has asked the government for 16 million to help 
tide it over housing officials said friday 
its certainly better for us to reasonably consider giving 
them a 16 million loan rather than having to pay off 150 million 
thats the consideration said adolph slaughter a local 
spokesman for the us department of housing and urban development 
the 48story fourbuilding complex called presidential towers 
began generating controversy even before its construction in the 
mid1980s community activists said it would displace many poor and 
homeless people 
with the help of us rep dan rostenkowski dchicago the 
developers received a federal exemption from requirements that they 
set aside some apartments for lowincome renters 
unfurnished studios start at 525 a month while threebedroom 
units begin at 2460 the four towers on the western edge of 
downtown have more than 2300 apartments in all 
the organization that owns presidential towers the habitat co 
made its last mortgage payment on the 1589 million loan in 
january executive vice president douglas woodworth said friday 
the loan is held by american national bank amp trust co of 
chicago a subsidiary of first chicago corp and is insured by the 
federal housing administration 
if it went into default it would mark one of the biggest 
defaults ever on an fha loan slaughter said 
woodworth said habitat was unable to make its payments in part 
because realestate taxes were higher than we anticipated he 
also said a tight rental market forced habitat to grant more 
concessions to attract renters than had been anticipated he said 
the towers were about 90 percent leased 
on march 1 american national filed a default notice with hud 
an action slaughter described as routine 
they have not defaulted they are delinquent he said 
there is a distinct difference 
slaughter said hud is examining habitats loan request 
woodworth said he is confident the developers will be able to 
turn their financial situation around if they receive the hud loan 
to cover operating losses

a federal court jury said friday it was 
deadlocked on all eight charges against us district judge robert 
aguilar who is accused of trying to influence criminal cases for 
his friends 
the trial judge told jurors to resume their deliberations and 
sent them home for the weekend after another 90 minutes aguilars 
lawyers moved unsuccessfully for a mistrial and said they would 
renew the motion monday 
the developments came during the sixth full day of deliberations 
in the trial of aguilar the first federal judge ever charged with 
racketeering 
aguilar 58 of san jose a 1980 appointee of president jimmy 
carter is accused of approaching two fellow judges to seek 
favorable treatment for felons disclosing a wiretap to its target 
helping a fugitive remain free and of fabricating a coverup story 
to the fbi and a grand jury 
the charges are punishable by 55 years in prison and 2 million 
in fines aguilar also could be impeached by congress which has 
removed three other federal judges from office since 1986 
also charged in the case are former teamster leader rudy tham 
and abe chapman an 83yearold exconvict who was formerly related 
to aguilar by marriage the are accused of trying to get aguilar to 
use his influence with a colleague to help tham get a new trial on 
a 1980 embezzlement conviction 
jury foreman carl damico told us district judge louis bechtle 
at midafternoon friday that the jurors had deliberated on every 
charge without reaching a unanimous decision on any of the 
allegations against any defendant 
bechtle rejected a defense request to ask the jurors whether 
further deliberations would be fruitful a prelude to declaring a 
mistrial instead he ordered jurors back to work after delivering 
a version of the socalled dynamite charge that is sometimes 
given to deadlocked juries 
jurors in the minority should ask themselves if they are right 
consider the views of the other jurors bechtle said if 
you can do so without violence to your individual judgment it is 
highly desirable that there be a verdict 
aguilar denied any attempt to influence cases or obstruct 
justice his lawyers portrayed him as a decent man who made some 
mistakes in judgment out of loyalty to friends

the shropshires living room that showed the boy panting drooling 
grabbing a balloon in his mouth and barking

legislation that advocates say would give 
idaho the nations toughest antiabortion law cleared a state 
senate committee friday and was headed for final legislative vote 
the bill would ban abortion as a means of birth control it 
would outlaw abortion except in cases of nonstatutory rape reported 
within seven days incest if the victim is under 18 years old 
severe fetal deformity or a threat to life or physical health of 
the mother 
idaho is taking the step and is willing to take the step to 
lead this nation in protecting the life of unborn children 
declared kerry uhlenkott of right to life of idaho 
antiabortion activists campaigning for the bill said they see 
it as a potential vehicle to attack the us supreme courts 1973 
roe vs wade ruling which legalized abortion legal challenges are 
a nearcertainty if the bill becomes law and such a challenge 
could reach the high court supporters have said 
in annapolis md meanwhile antiabortion legislators on 
friday continued a filibuster that blocked action on a bill that 
would liberalize the states abortion law 
the idaho senates state affairs committee voted 74 to send the 
strict abortion bill to the full senate for final action probably 
on wednesday since the bill is identical to a measure passed by 
the house last week senate approval would send the measure to gov 
cecil andrus for signature 
a handful of senators are uncertain said sen roger madsen 
a republican but even if the bill losses all the undecideds 
well still win 
andrus has declined to commented on the measure other than to 
reiterate his opposition to abortion except in the case of rape 
incest or a threat to the life of the mother 
legislators on both sides of the issue agreed the measure would 
preclude over 90 percent of the estimated 1500 abortions performed 
in idaho each year 
the maryland bill blocked by the filibuster would replace a 
relatively restrictive 1968 law that hasnt been enforced since the 
the roe vs wade ruling supporters of the bill want a prochoice 
replacement for the 1968 law in case the supreme court overturns 
roe vs wade 
the proposed law would allow unrestricted access to abortions 
until the fetus is able to survive outside the womb abortions 
after the fetus is viable would be prohibited except to save the 
life of the mother or to protect her physical or mental health

the state on friday closed the 
juvenile probation camp whose two counselors and three students 
were among seven people who drowned last month in an icy eastern 
sierra lake 
the california department of social services cited allegations 
of sexual misconduct lack of supervision and improper medication 
of students at camp oneal in ordering the closure 
sixteen residents of the camp for youthful offenders were 
immediately relocated to other facilities pending the outcome of a 
hearing to revoke its operating permit said kathleen norris an 
agency spokeswoman 
three teenagers from the camp two camp counselors and two 
wouldbe rescuers drowned in nearby convict lake on feb 19 after 
the youths broke through thin ice during a presidents day outing 
the adults died trying to save the others 
the camp director bobbi trott called the closure unfounded and 
said she was confident the matter would be successfully appealed 
the camp has 15 days to file its appeal and the state has 30 days 
after that to schedule a hearing 
i think what is unfortunate is that the state goes in and 
talks to exemployees especially disgruntled employees and comes 
up with allegations ms trott said 
ms norris said the camp was closed because of allegations that 
one camp resident was sexually assaulted by another in 1988 
and a camp resident was molested by a woman staff member in 1989 
behaviormodifying drugs were administered without 
prescription to students who ranged in age from 12 to 18 to keep 
them from causing trouble 
the camp did not provide proper care and supervision to its 
charges

authorities speculate the women accepted money or drugs in 
exchange for access to the children the women who are believed to 
be halfsisters engaged in a lesbian relationship often watched 
while the men raped the children 
god knows how many generations of abuse you have inflicted on 
these children corsiglia said because we know abuse begets 
abuse

falling apart according to a soviet report that the pentagon on 
saturday refused to confirm 
the report by the novosti news agency said four orbiting 
fragments were spotted on march 7 that presumably separated from 
the american spy satellite 
a us space agency official said such fragments can be 
nonessential pieces such as protective shrouds but the 
washington post said members of congress and the intelligence 
community were told the satellite had suffered a malfunction 
there was disagreement in washington over the impact of such a 
loss of datagathering capability especially in light of eased 
tensions between the two superpowers 
should the satellite or pieces of it fall toward earth 
presumably over the soviet union they most likely would 
disintegrate in the atmosphere

as the 1920s it first arrived on brazils northern coast from 
radio stations in french guyana which intensely played caribbean 
salsa merengue cumbia rumba reggae mambo soca and compas 
music 
mixed with slow native rhythms lambada caught on in the 
northern amazon state of para the name came from musicians 
whipping their guitar strings to provide the beat 
but the dance performed with the mans right leg thrust between 
his partners thighs was considered obscene and relegated to slums 
and villages 
after a rightwing military coup in 1964 the lambada became a 
form of protest in northern brazil against censorship and 
repression 
later it moved down the coast to bahia state the center of 
brazilian black culture where it gained a heavier bolder step 
musicians beat their drums or rudimentary percussion instruments 
with their hands and combined heavier beats taken from 
afrobrazilian dances such as carimbo sirimbo and forro 
after the country returned to civilian rule in 1985 the dance 
got even steamier 
both sexes started rolling their hips in unison yanking their 
partners chesttochest close and women began sliding one thigh 
high up the mans hip while being dipped until her hair nearly 
touched the floor 
indeed when french record producers jean karakos and oliver 
lorsac first saw lambada in porto seguro brazil in 1988 they 
planned to market it as one spokesman at cbs records put it 
as an alternative to sex in the age of aids 
they hit the right chord sexy lambada videos began flitting 
across american and european tv screens and dance schools filled 
with young people aching to learn the lambada 
the queen of lambada is loalwa bras 36 vocalist and leader 
of the sevenmember band and dance troupe kaoma bras has netted 
12 million in royalties since 1986 when she started giving 
lambada shows in paris 
her latest lp worldbeat released by epic records in june 
has already sold 6 million copies worldwide 
now following a triumphant return from europe lambada has 
brazils adrenaline and cash registers pumping 
rios classiest dance clubs such as the hippopotamus 
discotheque which requires black tie only and the trendy banana 
cafe in the beachfront neighborhood of ipanema are promoting 
lambada night sundays 
posh nightclubs such as rios canecao are packing audiences at 
15 a seat with shows by lambada singers elba ramalho and beto 
barbosa on weekends it is common to see beachgoers gyrating to 
lambada music under strawroofed pavillions along rios sandy 
shores 
four top lambada albums titled dancando lamabada 
lambateria tropical i lambadas que eu gosto and 
lambateria have sold more than 1 million copies nationwide 
since july 
carlos santos and geronimo two of the hottest lambada stars 
from para state together have sold more than 3 million records in 
this nation of 150 million people 
the boom has even inspired a new lambada fashion for women 
lambada wear consists of black suede shoes halter tops glitzy 
sashes and miniskirts that fly up above the waist at the slightest 
twirl revealing string bikini underwear 
lambada boutiques are popping up in major cities around the 
country and retailers are frantically trying to keep up with the 
latest colors and fabrics 
our best sellers are black silk miniskirts with mustard 
fringes we cant keep them on the shelves said jiojanna 
fereira manager of the chicletes com banana boutique in the 
southestern city of belo horizonte 
despite some puritanic grumbles many brazilians see the sweaty 
sensual dance as a release from economic woes and an electronic 
impersonal computer age 
what you look for in lambada is not the lyrics or melody but a 
sense of freedom of celebration said lea oliveira da silva 
27 a city hall employee when im on the dance floor i feel 
hot like i can let myself go and not think twice about it

sometimes mary freeland looks at her son 
and remembers the kid who used to coast his bike down colonel bell 
drive to the whoops of the neighborhood gang 
but then she looks again and reality crashes in its two 
decades later and he still is that child 
its two decades later and mary is back to being a fulltime 
mother six years after she placed her son in a school for the 
mentally retarded and began a new life the state has run out of 
money and patrick along with hundreds of other adults like him 
has been sent home 
im a grandmother said mary whose eldest daughter molly 
has a son and im raising a child ill be raising forever 
starting all over again 
similar situations affect more than 63000 families nationwide 
the us association for retarded citizens says 
the future is frightening and uncertain everyone even patrick 
knows he needs to return to the kind of structured environment he 
was forced to leave when he reached the cutoff age of 22 last june 
in his pale unlined face the family sees patricks anger at 
the separation from the residential school where friends and a 
rigid routine kept him in balance 
in his seizures and increasing violence they witness utter 
despair 
lately patrick more frequently refuses to walk and instead 
folds his body into a wheelchair deflated as much by loneliness as 
by his trembling and calcified joints over the new years weekend 
he threw himself down a flight of steps a few weeks later he did 
it again 
were watching him become more and more passive and slow hes 
not the patrick i first met eight years ago said stephen 
freeland who combined his two children with marys five when they 
married in 1984 
these people are fighters they have coped with patrick and 
another retarded child a 24yearold daughter of marys under 
state care who turned 22 before the cutoff requirement was in place 
together mary and stephen have weathered divorce beaten 
alcoholism overcome depression and made ends meet they held on 
after the suicide five years ago of marys eldest son who would 
have been 25 today 
but watching this second son a poster child for a mental health 
organization in 1974 collapse into depression and destructive 
outbursts has been too much to bear 
ive lost one son already i cant sit by and watch while i 
lose another said mary who is nearly 50 she divorced patricks 
father a decade before he died in 1988 
the freelands have written letters to newspaper editors and 
lobbied representatives but it looks unlikely the state will place 
patrick in the supervised group home his family feels he needs 
in massachusetts about 595 mentally retarded adults are at home 
who under healthier fiscal circumstances would be provided 
residential care said maureen sullivan of the state department of 
mental retardation another 989 people are on daycare waiting 
lists she said 
parents and activists have taken their cases to the 
massachusetts courts but havent been able to force the states 
hand 
the states budget crisis forced the freeze on funding for 
mentally retarded adults and strong antitax sentiments have 
stalled efforts to reverse the situation said philip johnston 
massachusetts secretary of human services 
patrick is falling apart because hes not getting what he 
needs and im beginning to lose control because nothing is normal 
anymore mary said 
nothing is normal family members are drawn into patricks 
quirky world and although they are wise to his attempts at 
manipulation its hard to deny him the routine he relied on when 
under professional care 
patrick gets things in his head the way he wants things done 
and when he wants only certain people to get him up in the morning 
and if they dont he wont budge said stephen whose 
15yearold son shane usually is the alarm clock of choice 
shanes job is to roust patrick from bed and start him dressing 
while his father hunts down a razor and prepares for the ritual 
painstaking shave mary must be sure she has the exact cereal brand 
and flavor of juice for her son who wont eat otherwise 
after school 18yearold cathy often leaves her friends to go 
home and keep an eye on patrick who spends hours in his upstairs 
bedroom writing random names hundreds of times or endlessly 
listening to the taped voices of friends lost when he left the 
cardinal cushing school 
mary is trying to launch an insurance business and stephen is 
struggling to sell real estate despite the slumping local market 
but their thoughts never stray far from patrick who spends part of 
the week at a day care center 
this balancing act takes its toll 
my son told me yesterday i need you to stay home with me and 
be here mary said her voice cracking and i know i should 
i know hes right but ive got to work and i just cant care for a 
6foottall man 24 hours a day 
stephen a steady realist who shares with mary a cockeyed humor 
amid the tragic and absurd picks up a lot of the slack but even 
this sturdy bearded man has met his match in patrick 
sometimes i feel like taking a plane out of here but i 
love the family i wouldnt want to be alone said stephen a 
veteran who was briefly homeless when he returned from vietnam 
alcoholics anonymous has helped the freelands deal with drinking 
problems but theyre on their own when it comes to the pressures 
of life with patrick 
support groups and outreach programs would help but were 
barely able to give the basic services said colleen turner a 
spokeswoman for the association for retarded citizens state 
chapter these families are isolated and alone 
on some of the toughest days mary crawls into bed and buries 
herself in the sheets she closes her eyes and tries to block 
everything out but patrick is still down the hall and his pain 
still comes first 
so mary pulls herself back together 
people say im a survivor and i guess i am she said but 
how do you survive this insanity how do you watch your child 
drifting away

to many governments in the 
asiapacific region selling unprofitable inefficient state 
companies to private investors seemed an ideal way to spur economic 
growth or reduce debt 
the results have been mixed and the process is not always 
smooth 
in indonesia finance minister johannes sumarlin has said 215 
state companies were candidates for sale joint ventures or 
liquidation and in november listeed 52 for sale critics include 
consumer activists militant moslems intellectuals cooperatives 
and the armed forces 
president corazon aquino of the philippines who inherited an 
enormous debt and moneylosing state companies in 1986 set about 
getting the government out of business the asset privatization 
trust has sold off enterprises worth more than 400 million 
singapores public sector divestment committee recommended in 
1985 that more than 500 state companies and authorities be sold 
the telecommunications authority with a possible market 
capitalization equivalent to 54 billion is expected to be 
private and listed on the stock exchange by 1992 or 1993 
taiwan has plans to put 19 of its 45 state enterprises in 
private hands all 45 have more than 200000 employees and account 
for up to 30 percent of total output 
in pakistan prime minister benazir bhutto said last year her 
country would follow britains lead in selling stock in staterun 
industries to achieve broadbased ownership 
japan started offering shares in the telecommunications giant 
nippon telegraph and telephone four years ago 
south koreas generally successful divestment program includes 
the largest steel producer other manufacturers banks utilities 
and trading firms 
nowhere was the goal of privatization given greater priority 
than in malaysia 
seven years after the program was announced however only 21 
government operations have gone private through direct sale of 
existing assets public listing on the stock exchange management 
contracts or temporary ownership arrangments 
they include the national airline a lottery public utilities 
shipping companies highway construction projects a television 
station and removal of garbage from kuala lumpur city hall 
plans call for electric power and the railroads to move toward 
private ownership this year senior officials talk for the first 
time however of poor progress red tape the need for a master 
plan and lack of enthusiasm among civil servants 
lack of understanding of the policy hampers privatization 
and it has not been carried out well finance minister daim 
zainuddin said 
too many civil servants are unsure of the objectives and 
methods daim said in a recent speech but this problem is being 
overcome the government has already prepared a privatization 
master plan 
other officials cite resistance by labor unions legal and 
financial obstacles administrative problems and accusations of 
political favoritism 
daim said the government once provided the equivalent of 107 
billion in loan guarantees for about 1000 state companies at 
least 246 were tagged for sale out of 434 studied by a team of 
foreign and domestic merchant bankers 
conversion of the railroads is expected to be the big test the 
6000member railwaysmens union of malaya has pledged to fight 
how can we accept commercialization of any sort when even in 
an advanced country like japan the system has cost the removal of 
75000 railway workers said union leader abdul gaffoor ibrahim 
malaysias narrowgauge singletrack system was offered for 
sale in 1986 for a token 1 ringgit 37 cents in hopes private 
owners would improve service and achieve profitability there were 
no takers 
labor opposition also delays an ambitious program in neighboring 
thailand where planners saw denationalization as a cure for 
inefficiency and an overburdened infrastructure 
about 5800 port workers struck three times in six months 
against a government decision to let private firms operate at least 
part of a new deepsea container port at laem chabang 80 miles 
south of bangkok 
hong kong has put its port water supplies post office civil 
aviation and other essential services in private hands but the 
british crown colony reverts in 1997 to control by china which has 
rejected private ownership 
political regimes that are based on privatized economies breed 
all forms of corruption the chinese communist party newspaper 
peoples daily said in december 
public ownership has become an irreversible trend it said 
and declared capitalist privatization determines that the 
capitalist gets the bigger interest and thus the workers become the 
depressed and exploited

and you thought fitting into one of those gold 
lame dresses on oscar night was tough try slipping into this 
years academy awards show now thats a tight squeeze 
after two years at the spacious shrine auditorium the 62nd 
annual academy awards show is moving back to the more elegant but 
cramped dorothy chandler pavilion which has nearly 3000 fewer 
seats 
with dozens of chairs removed for television cameras only 2990 
are left for the blacktie audience as a result this years oscar 
tickets have become the hottest property in town 
about half of the remaining seats are reserved for members of 
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences other blocks go to 
advertisers on the abc telecast performers presenters guests 
press and the academys board of governors 
nominees are invited but they should forget about bringing 
their family and friends 
phil alden robinson the writerdirector of bestpicture 
candidate field of dreams has only two seats for himself and 
a date his parents who are coming to los angeles from florida for 
the awards still dont have tickets and his mother even bought a 
new dress for the occasion 
last year i heard all nominees could get four tickets 
robinson said now its down to two tickets its brutal 
however oliver stone whose born on the fourth of july is 
up for eight oscars including best picture asked for and 
received two extra tickets but one of stones agents mike 
menchel wasnt so lucky less than two weeks before the gala 
menchel was working the phones trying to score an extra pair of 
seats 
the real battle is being waged among midlevel studio executives 
who consider academy award tickets to be a hollywood status symbol 
tickets for the posttelecast governors ball are impossible to 
find too 
major studios such as the walt disney co and paramount pictures 
all receive 20 seats independent film companies are given between 
six and 12 tickets each so you have a company with 1500 
employees and 30 or more of those people have the title of vice 
president or higher and they want to bring dates said one 
studio publicist all of a sudden you have 60 people clamoring 
for 20 seats its obscene 
said one executive at universal pictures its going to be 
very hard for a lot of people here because we have so many 
nominated films we have 17 nominations and the creative people 
from all the films want to go 
most wont be able to the tickets wont filter down like they 
did last year the universal executive said 
the ticket crunch has become so intense that the academy has 
been unable to fill hundreds of orders from the academys 5300 
members weve got a lot of enemies said oscar spokesman bob 
werden 
top oscar seats costing 200 apiece sold out the first day 
with 272 requests denied that day said otto spoerri the academys 
controller last year he said every members order was filled 
the oscars are no stranger to downtowns dorothy chandler 
pavilion site of the awards ceremony from 1969 to 1987 in 1988 
because of increasing interest in the oscar pageant the show was 
moved to the larger shrine five miles south 
while the cavernous facility accommodated more guests traffic 
was a mess and the surrounding neighborhood not much better 
so its back to the chandler this year but not to worry the 
academy plans to return to the shrine again next year 
this year the academy was forced to place an ad in the trade 
newspaper daily variety encouraging members to attend one of the 
many unofficial oscar night parties around town rather than pester 
the academy for nonexistent show tickets six academy staffers 
field ticketrelated calls all day every day 
wed be enormously grateful if each of you would resist 
making that phone call to which wed only have to say no the 
ad read 
some members are scalping their seats and the academy is 
trying to track down the malefactors a member caught selling 
tickets is banned from all future oscar seat purchases spoerri 
said 
murrays tickets which once scalped seats for a mass given by 
pope john paul ii at dodger stadium is selling oscar seats for as 
much as 2500 apiece 
this year its hot said the firms lance keller its not 
a highvolume thing but the prices are high the cheapest seat 
murrays is selling costs 650 
movie fans and frustrated entertainers are the worst off louis 
valentine a pianist who thinks he can find his big break at the 
oscar show placed a classified ad asking for show tickets 
i just want to see what its like and meet people ive tried 
everything possible to get into the business valentine said 
so far ive got three calls from my ad and the prices were 
unbelievable 
the cheapest was 700 for one ticket i cant go higher than 
300 or maybe 350 max

there was a time when they used to drive 
convertibles in hollywood now they drive convertible debentures 
and laurel and hardy have been replaced by a new team mergers amp 
acquisitions 
the effects of this march of the conglomerates on the movie 
world are being examined wednesday in an nbc news special the 
new hollywood its anchored by tom brokaw who can recall the 
remnants of the old hollywood 
he first saw it in 1966 when he began at nbcowned knbctv in 
burbank as the new anchor in town he came in contact with assorted 
hollywood folk stars agents apprentice moguls and their close 
personal friends 
his memories in those days it seemed more stately than it 
does now maybe im deluding myself but it seemed to me there was 
at least a residue of the old elegance of hollywood now its 
hustle city 
when he was new in town he recalls assorted sages were 
predicting that the era of the big studios was over that they were 
going to roll over and die and the little independent films were 
taking hold in many ways 
well not even sages can be right all the time 
the conglomerization of hollywood has tended to make the 
talk there guarded cautious and corporate a far cry from 
yesteryears lavish babble 
thus brokaw says he was surprised that todays hollywood 
inmates including oscar candidate directorwriter oliver stone 
were willing to talk to him about the new hollywood and its 
bottomline brigade 
but he drew a blank with one of hamlets major movers and 
shakers michael ovitz a party often identified as a superagent 
who handles superstars 
brokaw said he talked by phone with ovitz chairman of creative 
artists agency and he simply would not cooperate mike ovitz 
said he would be happy to talk to me off the record if i wouldnt 
tell anybody that we were talking so i thought id pass 
the nbc nightly news anchorman like his rivals at cbs and 
abc has been concerned with more serious matters in recent years 
the loss of audience to cable and independent stations 
true abcs world news tonight has risen to a consistent 
first in the ratings and increased its audence but in the most 
recent nielsens for the week ending march 11 the major network 
newscasts had only a combined 58 percent share of the audience 
the common problem brokaw says is that theres no longer a 
level playing field anywhere in the country network newcasts are 
being shifted around by local affiliates battling game shows and 
syndicated sortof news shows where formerly they battled each 
other or local newscasts 
where will all this lead the network newscasts 
well you hope they survive he says but i do think weve 
got to get out of the halfhour format and go to an hour format 
in early evenings network affiliates have resisted such proposals 
for years 
brokaw says he thinks theyre going to have to work out some 
cooperative arrangement with the networks because these 
affiliates are now in the same boat with us 
theyre competing with an even greater cable penetration 
around the country cable now is in more than 57 percent of the 
nations tv households and with independent stations and next 
year with a fox network newscast theyre going to have to do 
something 
hes been proposing a onehour twopart nbc nightly news as 
a possible solution the first part he says would entail doing 
pretty much what were doing now hard news investigative 
reports and the like 
what he calls page two of the broadcast its second halfhour 
would have more backofthebook kinds of stuff features 
profiles of various newsmakers and whats generally known as soft 
news 
however brokaw says such a twopart broadcast isnt under 
active consideration at nbc news 
no i think its fair to say that its on the back burner 
he says 
it may be discussed at the annual nbc affiliates convention in 
june in washington dc he says any plans to urge them to accept 
the idea 
not that i know of brokaw said

is japans trade surplus destined for the dustbin 
of the usjapan agenda 
with the broadest measure of japans financial flows already in 
the red and other major indicators plunging some observers think 
the united states is mistaken to focus on eliminating its trade 
deficit with the japanese 
while no one expects balanced trade between the worlds top two 
economies some are predicting japan soon will run a deficit with 
the world at large and more important that the challenge 
presented by its industries and trade practices could be stronger 
than ever 
bill emmott former tokyo bureau chief for the economist 
magazine forecasts that japans current account surplus the broad 
measure of merchandise trade services and tourism will dwindle by 
the end of the decade possibly much sooner 
japans economy is passing through a phase of imbalance with 
the world that will soon be righted emmott writes in his 
recently published book the sun also sets the limits to japans 
economic power 
in january the current account fell into deficit for the first 
time in four years showing a 636 million shortfall vs a 25 
billion surplus in january 1989 
the japanese economy appears to have slipped its leash the 
stock market and yen are falling interest rates exceptionally low 
in the late 1980s are leaping 
the bank of japans effort to prop up the yen has drained 
japans foreign reserves from 100 billion last april to 80 
billion in february 
william h brown president of the investment advisory firm 
scudder stevens and clark japan said the financial markets were 
responding to changes taking place that were not anticipated at 
the end of last year the us economy is a lot better than we 
had expected the slight improvement in the us trade deficit is 
partly a result 
but he warned that it was too early to tell whether tectonic 
plate shifts in the usjapanese economic relationship were 
taking place 
indeed the weak yen is expected to cause a resurgence of 
japanese exports later this year but the more durable trend is 
downward said several observers 
the merchandise trade surplus fell for the 10th straight month 
in february to 5 billion down 30 percent from a year earlier 
japan will have a trade deficit in the future said us 
businessman joseph a grimes president of hill and knowlton japan 
with all its investment overseas a continuing surplus doesnt 
mathematically work out 
the reversal appears to stem from market factors such as strong 
domestic demand and higher world oil prices not official measures 
demanded by washington to widen access to japans market 
february imports rose nearly 12 percent to 169 billion by 
comparison the governments import promotion plan unveiled with 
much fanfare at the beginning of the year promises to increase 
imports by only about 3 billion a year 
americans who focus on the trade deficit with japan are 
missing the real target of trade policy emmott said 
instead he said the united states should whack the japanese 
over the head about unfair trade practices in specific industries 
grimes expressed concern that the us government will lose 
interest in fighting trade barriers if the deficit dwindles 
i jokingly tell business chambers you ought to be glad 
theres a trade deficit 
fortunately for us businessmen overseas the usjapanese 
trade imbalance is expected to persist even if japan goes into 
deficit overall because japan has to import raw materials which 
it can only do by exporting finished products to the united states 
and other developed markets 
the idea said grimes is to get it down to a workable 
level perhaps in the range of 20 billion in 1989 japan had a 
surplus of 49 billion in trade with the united states 
a japan without an overall trade surplus still would represent a 
formidable economic challenge emmott said because of its overseas 
production bases 
leon hollerman author of japan disincorporated the economic 
liberalization process also suggests japan is evolving into an 
international headquarters country

a 36yearold financial consultant and 
former economics professor has been given the job of steering 
brazil the largest nation in latin america out of its worst 
economic crisis 
zelia cardoso de mello a champion of free markets heads the 
new economics ministry created by combining the finance commerce 
and planning and industry portfolios it is the most powerful post 
in the cabinet 
when president fernando collor de mello appointed her he said 
the success of my administration depends on you good luck 
professor zelia and may god help us his government took office 
last week 
cardoso de mello who is not related to the president is 
confronted by an inflation rate of more than 70 percent a month and 
the largest foreign debt in the developing world 
after the new government was installed she announced austerity 
measures that include increased taxes a severe tightening of the 
money supply sale of state enterprises a sharp reduction in 
government spending and an end to all subsidies and tax incentives 
she said taxes would be imposed on capital gains and 
agriculture banks and other financial institutions will be forced 
to buy new privatization certificates to hasten the sale of 
poorly run moneylosing state companies to private investors 
anonymous interestbearing accounts used for illicit or 
undeclared income were banned the minister said owners of such 
accounts will have to identify themselves and justify the deposits 
or pay a 25 percent tax on them 
a newspaper profile described cardoso de mello as a discreet 
and methodical woman who strongly defends her ideas and interests 
she holds a doctorate in economics from the university of sao 
paulo where she taught world and brazilian economic history 
andre franco montoro made cardoso de mello administrative 
director of the sao paulo housing development agency in 1983 when 
he was governor of sao paulo brazils most populous and industrial 
state 
he now leads the leftofcenter brazilian social democracy 
party and said recently there are few people as prepared as she 
is to be minister of the economy 
cardoso de mello held a midlevel finance ministry job in 
198687 analyzing federal investment and loan programs for the 
states that was when she met collor who was governor of 
northeastern alagoas and sought help in renegotiating the states 
debt to the federal government 
when she left the government to set up her own consulting firm 
collors state administration was among her first clients cardoso 
de mello has been his chief economic adviser since he announced his 
presidential candidacy early last year 
andrea calabi once her professor and later her boss in the 
finance ministry said experience in government and consulting gave 
cardoso de mello a thorough knowledge of productivity cost 
reduction interest rates industrial growth employment and debt 
renegotiation 
she will bring to the new government a very rare and positive 
blend of practical historical and theoretical knowledge of 
economic and financial matters that definitely qualify her for the 
ministry calabi said 
among brazils problems are raging inflation a foreign debt of 
114 billion largest in the developing world an internal debt of 
at least 100 billion a bloated and inefficient government 
bureaucracy and a host of stateowned companies that are losing 
money 
on march 2 the day after her appointment cardoso de mello told 
a news conference proposed to increase taxes collect them reduce 
the size of government sell off state companies and renegotiate 
the brazils debts 
with these measures we believe inflation will drop she 
declared 
brazil will commit a portion of its 303 billion gross national 
product to pay the debts but will not sacrifice economic growth 
she said 
collor has pledged that inflation will be down to 10 percent a 
month when he has been in office 100 days none of the economists 
interviewed would comment on his chances of being right 
raul czarny a university of sao paulo economist said brazil 
was in a nowornever situation and cardoso de mellos ability 
to deal with it would depend on the public and political support 
she can muster for her ideas

not so at conservation international where some brash young 
biologists who prefer jeans and khakis are running what they call 
a lean mean conservation machine 
since its founding in january 1987 conservation international 
has scored a string of rapidfire successes 
in july 1987 it executed the first debtfornature swap 
purchasing and forgiving 650000 of bolivias foreign debt in 
exchange for the countrys establishment of a wildlife preserve 
within its borders 
others had been talking about debt swaps for three years 
conservation international put the first deal together when it was 
only 6 months old 
the group has tapped new sources of funds enlisting such 
unorthodox environmental advocates as the material girl 
madonna who raised 200000 last year with her dont bungle the 
jungle concert in brooklyn and bergdorf goodman which donated 
50000 from a benefit fashion show last october 
the organization has established a conservation program in the 
sierra nevada de santa marta massif on the coast of colombia where 
government officials campesinos and indians maintain an uneasy 
coexistence with guerillas and drugrunners 
when the areas drug lords were convinced the field workers were 
not from the cia or setting up a competitive operation they 
allowed the program to continue 
its a classic example of how you can do conservation 
anywhere says conservation internationals president russell 
mittermeier 
ci reminds me of the peace corps in its early days when it 
was led by sargent shriver and it was thought that nothing was 
undoable says patricia kelly vice president for communications 
and a former peace corps volunteer 
this spring conservation international will dispatch 
environmental swat teams to assess urgent conservation needs in 
eastern paraguay and northern bolivia and will participate in the 
april 22 celebration of the 20th anniversary of earth day with the 
construction of a rain forest in a tent on the mall in washington 
dc 
the man responsible for much of this activity is mittermeier 
40 a wildlife biologist with 20 years experience in the tropics 
a recent conservation international report pictures him emerging 
from a swamp in suriname covered with mud up to his neck holding a 
wriggling pipa pipa or suriname toad 
we have a motto heads in the sky feet in the mud says 
peter seligmann the board chairman and key fundraiser who also is 
trained in biology 
mittermeier has published more than 200 scientific papers and 
speaks six languages including surinamese in 1974 he 
rediscovered the yellowtailed woolly monkey in peru decades after 
experts had decided it probably was extinct a magazine article 
dubbed him russell of the apes 
when he joined conservation international last may leaving a 
post as vice president for science at the world wildlife fund he 
brought half a dozen other fund scientists with him including 
longtime colleague mark plotkin an authority on medicinal uses of 
the rain forest 
they joined a staff of 50 most of whom had made up the 
international program at the nature conservancy until january 1987 
when a policy dispute led to a bitter split between the 
international and domestic programs 
mittermeiers office is appointed in a style that might be 
called early smithsonian spears decorate one wall giant masks and 
carved deities stare back from another boxes of slides and piles 
of scientific monographs cover his desk a large table and most of 
the floor 
two things set us apart from other conservation 
organizations mittermeier says 
one is a reliance on local conservationists to run the programs 
abroad 
sixty percent of conservation internationals staff is latin 
american the hallways echo with the sounds of spanish portuguese 
surinamese and malagasy the language of madagascar 
the second distinguishing feature mittermeier says is its 
strong scientific base as exemplified by the conservation swat 
teams 
were sending these guys out to spend a couple of weeks and 
get an assessment of priorities he says thats going to help 
us make sure were focusing our money on the right things 
the teams will be made up of some of the worlds best field 
biologists mittermeier says one is theodore parker a recently 
hired ornithologist 
he can go into an area and identify 90 percent of the birds in 
two days mittermeier says not only by sightings he can do it 
by sound hes got an incredible ear 
scientists like parker can do in a couple of weeks what can 
take an ordinary scientist several years says mittermeier who 
plans to pay well for that expertise the biologists should be 
paid at least as much as the lawyers and accountants 
in january conservation international issued its master 
conservation plan for the 1990s called the rainforest 
imperative the report sets priorities in 10 tropical hotspots 
where urgent action is needed and in the five largest remaining 
pieces of tropical wilderness 
many of these occur in the 12 nations mittermeier calls 
megadiversity countries because together they contain 60 
percent of the worlds plant and animal species more animal and 
plant diversity than is found anywhere else 
conservation international has established or is planning 
conservation programs in nearly all of these places 
over the next decade we have to approach the conservation of 
biological diversity at the same level of intensity dedication 
devotion and investment with which we approached the race to the 
moon mittermeier says

aside from his home video work it was surely 
rob lowes most inept performance 
opening the oscar telecast a year ago an atonal lowe and a 
phony snow white labored through their own rendition of proud 
mary in the background a dancer bobbed under the weight of a 
huge headdress resembling hollywoods landmark chinese theater 
the rest of the show produced by campmeister allan carr was 
so rude that when the curtain finally fell 17 industry figures 
pounded out an angry note to the academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences 
signed by such luminaries as paul newman and gregory peck the 
letter attacked the broadcast as an embarrassment to both the 
academy and the entire motion picture industry even though it 
was a ratings hit 
lowes worst moment came when his sex video was made public 
while attending the democratic national convention in 1988 he made 
a videotape of sex involving himself and two young women in his 
atlanta hotel room claims and counterclaims rebounded and lowe 
agreed to do 20 hours of community service to avoid prosecution for 
allegedly seducing one of the women then a 16yearold her 
mothers suit against lowe is pending 
meanwhile walt disney co brought a federal trademark 
infringement suit against the academy claiming the snow white 
impostor actress eileen bowman also diluted the characters 
value the suit was filed after the academy refused to apologize 
for the unusual use of snow white and was dropped a week later 
when the academy apologized 
will this years 62nd annual academy awards program on monday 
night draw similar catcalls and problems 
gilbert cates the producer of the show has been hired to make 
sure the only groans heard in the dorothy chandler pavilion will be 
made by chair hinges as oscar guests jump up for standing ovations 
unlike carr who celebrated hollywood glitz by showcasing young 
hollywood stars like matt lattanzi and savion glover in an 
endless songanddance routine cates plans to focus this years 
program on the global film community 
the broadcast will include satellite feeds from companion oscar 
parties in moscow sydney australia tokyo london and buenos 
aires argentina with awards announced in all except tokyo 
each show is a kind of historical document cates said after 
viewing 25 oscar telecasts to prepare for this years event the 
1990 show he decided should reflect the exploding international 
market for movies as well as the political changes sweeping the 
world 
i hope that we get a sense of the fact that the world is 
smaller and by showing the international nature of the film 
industry that were all really interdependent on one another he 
said 
this year besides the five nominees for best foreign film 
overseas contenders include my left foot from ireland five 
nominations including best picture camille claudel from france 
two nominations including best foreign film and henry v from 
england three nominations including best director 
the program which cates said will run longer than 3 hours will 
be seen by about 1 billion people in more than 90 countries the 
director is jeff margolis whose credits include happy birthday 
hollywood and seven american music awards presentations 
this is a monster margolis said my first thought was 
how are we going to put this together its been a scheduling 
nightmare because of the time differences when the ceremony 
begins at 6 pm in los angeles it will be 5 am in moscow and 3 
am in london 
carrs show continues to haunt the academy but cates is 
confident his more tasteful approach can push recent history out of 
memory 
i think that everybody whos involved in this show is here 
without reference to the past show he said i get asked about 
allan carr a lot and i always said what i think is true he worked 
very hard he did the best show that he could and its very easy to 
mondaymorning quarterback 
the truth of the matter is that if these satellites work out 
well well all be heroes on tuesday if two of them crap out 
people will say what a stupid idea why would anyone try it 
so youre really at the mercy of a lot of things you dont 
control 
for the first time envelopes with the names of winners will be 
unsealed outside the united states price waterhouse will send 
bonded couriers to each foreign venue bearing envelopes with every 
possible winner 
each envelope will have a code on the outside and when the big 
moment comes the accounting firm will then tell the overseas 
presenters which marked envelope to open 
there are certainly possibilities for things to go awry 
said price waterhouses dan lyle but they wont 
the art direction award will be announced in london two 
documentary prizes will be revealed in buenos aires the 
foreignlanguage winner will be made known in moscow and sound and 
sound effects editing will be announced in sydney winners will be 
in los angeles 
cates said the international segments of his oscar presentation 
should consume about 20 minutes of show time the rest of the 
broadcast will be dedicated to the awarding of prizes and 
performances of nominated songs 
i think this institution has gone back to our earliest 
childhood he said most people knew about the academy awards 
when they were 3 4 and 5 years old and theyve been kind of 
watching every year 
there are very few annual events its almost like a national 
holiday in a way its like labor day the fourth of july people 
watch the academy awards show

investors hoping for higher stock prices say 
their optimism only increases these days when they see how 
unbullish mutual fund managers have become 
if history is any guide they proclaim the chances for a rising 
market get better and better the more the funds build up their cash 
reserves against the possibility of a decline 
in recent months the funds have been doing just that according 
to the investment company institute the industrys biggest trade 
group stock funds had 115 percent of their assets in cash at the 
end of january 
that was up from 104 percent a month earlier and 94 percent in 
january 1989 
the latest reading has been equaled or exceeded only a few times 
over the 36 years statistics have been maintained on the subject 
notes norman fosback editor of the investment advisory letter 
smart money 
each time it got that high in the past the stock market chalked 
up a healthy gain over the next 12 months he says 
at the end of july 1970 for example the percentage of fund 
assets in cash that is parked in shortterm money market 
investments like treasury bills and commercial paper issued by 
corporations reached 118 
over the ensuing year standard amp poors 500stock composite 
index rose 22 percent 
the cash ratio hit 127 percent in september 1974 following 
which the sampp 500 staged a oneyear advance of 32 percent 
on june 30 1982 fund cash stood at 117 percent shortly 
before the start of a dramatic rally that pushed the sampp 500 up 53 
percent by mid1983 
the cash ratio climbed back to 111 percent in november 1987 
just after wall streets black monday that was followed by a 19 
percent rally over the next 12 months 
todays market is clearly dominated by institutional 
investors fosback says consequently when the big boys are 
loaded with cash the market can prospectively benefit from their 
buying power 
furthermore most institutional investors are even more 
emotional than individual investors when it comes to following the 
prevailing trend they tend to rush into the market in response to 
rising prices and to vacate the market during times of widespread 
panic selling 
as a result they are most fully invested in stocks and hold 
the lowest cash reserves right at the top of a cycle and have 
their smallest commitment to stocks and the biggest cash reserves 
right at the bottom before big upmoves 
of course it can be argued that people who run stock mutual 
funds have a greater incentive to maintain cash reserves now than 
they did in bygone times when yields available in money market 
investments were small to negligible 
today when cash earns returns of 7 percent to 8 percent 
managers cant buy stocks just for say their dividend yields of 3 
percent or 4 percent 
but fosback says even if you run a computer calculation 
factoring in differences in interest rates the funds cash 
reserves are as high now as they have been at any time in recent 
history 
he concludes the funds have seldom in the past held large 
excess cash levels and been proven right by falling prices we 
expect them to be wrong again this time

her engagement to prince aya son of emperor 
akihito has transformed kiko kawashima from an unknown professors 
daughter into one of japans leading celebrities 
the sudden popularity of the 24yearold graduate student is 
most evident in womens magazines and afternoon television talk 
shows where she is affectionately called kikosan 
young women feel close to her said a reporter for the 
gossipy magazine josei seven she has a special warmth and 
cuteness and women look forward to her wedding as a kind of royal 
extravaganza 
the reporter who insisted on anonymity said the future 
princess had created a quiet boom in the sales of subdued orthodox 
fashions because women were imitating the kiko look 
sales of travels of the heart an introductory text in 
psychology written by mieko kamiya have soared since a magazine 
said it was miss kawashimas favorite book 
about 75000 copies had been sold between its publication in 
1975 and september when the article appeared the publishers have 
printed 55000 more and expect to sell at least 200000 by the 
wedding in late june of kiko and aya also 24 who is second in 
line to the throne 
i think its safe to say sales are up because of the 
connection to miss kawashima said chikao iso advertising 
director of nihon hyoronsha one of the books two publishers 
its not an easy book to read 
magazines may make her the stuff of dreams and throngs of 
admirers may seek a glimpse of the kiko smile but miss 
kawashima a commoner has learned that not even a princes 
betrothed is exempt from criticism 
an article in the sunday mainichi magazine said the old 
aristocracy considered her an outsider 
quoting a woman aristocrat it did not name the magazine said 
miss kawashima was frowned upon for flapping about too much 
waving to her admirers and shaking the outstretched hands she 
encounters everywhere 
it is absolutely too much the woman was quoted as saying 
she may be the princes fiancee but she is not a princess yet 
shes just a common person 
most members of the aristocracy were stripped of their titles 
after world war ii but many have preserved a closeknit society 
and have strong ties to the imperial palace 
empress michiko who will be miss kawashimas motherinlaw was 
the first commoner to marry into the royal family she is said to 
have suffered pyschological bullying from palace attendants and 
chamberlains who are trained to revere and protect the 
chrysanthemum thrones ancient traditions 
michiko was the daughter of a wealthy businessman however and 
accustomed to wealth and social position miss kawashimas father 
is of much humble means 
aya and kiko met as university students and came to know each 
other through a shared interest in nature she was studying 
psychology in graduate school when he proposed in september 
recognizing the difficulties miss kawashima will face the 
imperial household agency a government bureau that manages palace 
affairs hired tutors to help prepare her for royal life in an 
eightcourse princess education women may admire kikosan 
but they wouldnt want to take her place said the reporter for 
josei seven they know the life of a princess is not like 
what you read in fairy tales

the infernal racket of urban life can drive 
you crazy but theres only one person left at the environmental 
protection agency who can hear your complaints above the din 
epa scientist kenneth e feith is the guy who picks up the phone 
and listens to lamentations about noisy trucks and trash 
compactors shrieking jet planes and the banshee howl of the 
neighbors lawnmower 
feith 58 says he is the institutional memory of the epas 
office of noise abatement and control which once boasted a 10 
million budget and more than 100 employees working to make america 
quieter and saner 
the office went out of businesss in 1982 the victim of 
president reagans budgetcutting deregulation campaign it now 
ranks as a nonprogram without budget or staff 
feith who once wrote the epas antinoise regulations has 
other duties today but he answers a couple of dozen phone calls 
about noise pollution every week as a courtesy to the public 
i do this almost out of my hip pocket he says 
the noise meanwhile hasnt gone away if anything its 
getting worse experts estimate that more than 20 million americans 
are exposed daily to noise loud enough to cause permanent loss of 
hearing during a working lifetime 
that level is above 80 decibels about the intensity of noise 
produced by a vacuum cleaner or electrical tools 
studies also show that the stress of loud sustained noise can 
cause high blood pressure ulcers headaches insomnia respiratory 
ailments learning difficulties among children job absenteeism 
anxiety irritability and antisocial behavior 
if the bells of notre dame drove poor quasimodo nearly mad the 
decibels are still giving us fits to wit 
a 69yearold man living in a trailer home under a noisy 
airport flight path was arrested recently in llano calif after 
he allegedly took a 4foot mirror outside and tried to blind pilots 
with reflected sunlight 
an angry bavarian mounted a catapult in his front yard and 
launched his wifes homemade dumplings at lowflying jet fighters 
from a nearby military base 
a japanese apartment dweller distraught that a young girl 
ignored his repeated complaints about her loud piano playing went 
next door and stabbed the girl her sister and her mother 
a woman was taken into custody in new york city for allegedly 
aiming a doublebarreled shotgun at a maintenance worker outside 
her window complaining that he was disturbing her and her pets 
the aggravation may get worse before it gets better says dr 
alice h suter a research audiologist at the national institute 
for occupational safety and health and a leading expert on noise 
pollution 
my guess is that its somewhat noisier than it used to be 
she said in a telephone interview from her office in cincinnati 
the newly manufactured jet planes and heavy trucks are 
quieter but the overall amount of noise is greater just because 
theres more of everything construction planes traffic she 
said 
ms suter said lack of money has prevented accurate measurement 
of increased noise levels the demise of the epas noise office 
also meant that the pipeline of federal money for research and 
technical assistance to states and localities dried up 
as a result only 15 state and local antinoise programs are 
still active compared with 1100 in the mid1970s when noise 
pollution was a popular environmental cause 
the epas antinoise regulations remain in effect for trains 
heavy trucks railroad coupling and switching equipment air 
compressors motorcycles and labeling of earplugs but theres 
virtually no one to enforce them 
meanwhile despite improved truck exhaust mufflers and highway 
sound barriers vehicular traffic still ranks as the worst 
offender another source of potentially damaging noise is the 
typical american home with its leaf blowers mowers power tools 
food blenders dishwashers and laundry machines feith said 
the experts say noise pollution is easily ignored in an 
industrial society concerned with oil spills garbage smog and 
other more visible forms of pollution but they say it is no less 
hazardous to health 
theres never been a greenpeace or a sierra club for noise 
feith said 
people dont get as excited about noise as they do about 
cancercausing agents in the environment noise doesnt leave 
bodies in the streets but it can cause physical emotional and 
psychological effects that are just as debilitating

from the beginning it was a river of 
death within an ocean teeming with life an oil spill of 
incomprehensible proportions and incalculable consequences 
when the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef 4 minutes into 
march 24 1989 and leaked almost 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude into the sea the resulting destruction numbed the mind 
every statistic set a record 
searchers bagged 34400 dead seabirds thousands more simply 
disappeared at least 1000 sea otters died 151 eagles were lost 
1100 miles of shoreline was soaked with oil no one yet knows the 
impact on salmon fry that swam away from hatcheries through the 
crude will they come back when its their turn what about the 
herring the longterm impact on whales and bears 
the human impact equaled an invasion force an army of animal 
rescuers beach cleaners rock scrubbers bureaucrats experts 
more experts foreign experts even tourists descended upon prince 
william sound 
in valdez seward cordova homer kodiak and all the villages 
along the soiled seacoast grocery boys exhausted phone workers 
carpenters fishermen merchants housewives schoolchildren 
veterinarians police officers and educators found their lives 
upside down inside out 
yet amid all the statistics and clamor behind all the 
fingerpointing and 150 civil lawsuits individual memories are 
traced in the grease and grief 
here are the voices of four alaskans people whose lives were 
changed by what happened that frigid clear good friday in prince

two glass jars of congealed tar sit on anne castellinas desk at 
the seward headquarters of kenai fjords national park they are 
stinking reminders of carcasses tears lost sleep and disrupted 
lives all left in the deadly wake of the exxon valdez 
one jars contents were collected soon after oil blackened the 
magnificent coastline ms castellina as kenai fjords 
superintendent is charged to protect the other was filled last 
fall eight months after the crude came ashore the stench from 
both is gutwrenching the difference in the second jar lies in the 
residue of dead flesh and a justrecognizable feather 
ms castellina remembers 
i didnt have any idea what was coming i just knew we were 
getting sucked into it very fast our staff meeting on march 30th 
was the last sane time for nine months when i saw the phone man 
installing 25 lines and dragging in a huge xerox machine i knew we 
were cookin 
kenai fjords is ms castellinas first assignment as chief of a 
national park at 39 she is a 13year park service veteran with 
past assignments in virginia florida and new york 
the oil hit april 10th it was the worst day of my life i 
couldnt believe how bad it was it was the daily 6 pm briefing 
of the multi agency coordinating mac group our weatherman stood 
up and said today we had impacts on the headlands of aialik 
peninsula 
i just lost it my mind blanked i was stunned that night 
i could hardly talk i had an overwhelming feeling of guilt thats 
my park and i didnt stop the oil from hitting it i had 
irrational thoughts then and i dont think those feelings will 
ever go away completely 
a divorced mother of three adopted sisters from costa rica ms 
castellinas personal life evaporated 
i used to work 8to5 with an hour for lunch suddenly i 
never got home before 9 or 10 a baby sitter took a cab to my house 
every day at 3 pm cooked my kids dinner got them bathed and in 
bed she didnt drive so id give her cash and shed go to the 
grocery store in a cab my taxes didnt get done until late may i 
remember sitting there thinking i dont have the energy to do 
this and besides its not important the irs can wait i paid a 
huge late penalty 
ms castellina was head of the seward mac group a crisis 
committee encompassing local state and federal agencies 
i gave up worrying about my career about the time the coast 
guard threatened to take my job exxon and the coast guard kept 
saying you dont have a problem here but when sen ted stevens 
ralaska showed up he said you guys have got a problem here 
and we said yes we know 
thats when mac got in the oil booming business we took 
unilateral action it was a really scary time the interior 
department in washington was screaming but anchorage always 
backed me up they were a tremendous buffer even though they were 
taking it in the shorts 
i decided the hell with it if i get fired i get fired ive 
got to go on instinct and what the scientific data tells me i 
couldnt secondguess my decisions if id done that id have lost 
my mind 
kenai fjords has seven permanent employees and six to 12 summer 
workers to oversee 670000 acres and 400 miles of coastline 
my staff was falling apart one person withdrew from spill 
activity just couldnt handle it another who was out in the field 
most of the summer saw his marriage fall apart meanwhile 
77000 visitors arrived and had to be served properly i got a 
series of bladder infections and lived on antibiotics but my 
stresscaused asthma cleared up funny huh 
since then ms castellina has been elected to the board of the 
chamber of commerce the seward phoenix log newspaper recently 
selected her citizen of the year interior secretary manuel lujan 
jr flew in on an inspection tour and presented her with the 
interior department honor award 
im a lot less naive im less able to take things at face 
value because of all the broken promises ive matured in my 
understanding of the political aspects of disasters 
i now hear myself saying to my younger firebrand colleagues 
dont worry about it well get it worked out i am trying to be 
consistent and keep my integrity because more of the same is 
coming at us again this summer as we try once again to clean this 
mess up

before the spill i had it made said john devens i was a 
reasonably popular mayor whod served longer than anybody ever 
elected i was a college president with a good income and real good 
status i had a charter boat operators license and ran a little 
audiology practice on the side i had as near a perfect life as you 
could have 
remembering times before march 24 1989 devens allows a trace 
of wistfulness into his voice as though hes describing an old 
friend whos moved away 
he was mayor of valdez from 1984 until last october when he 
decided not to run again he presided over a town of 3500 a place 
nicknamed the switzerland of alaska because of mountains and 
glaciers that tumble into the sea home of the tanker terminal for 
the transalaska oil pipeline valdez was americas richest city 
per capita when oil prices were at their peak

before the exxon valdez ran aground 30 miles southwest of his 
front door devens was content one year later everything is 
different 
now im running for congress without the spill i would never 
have done this he said i had a personality change before i 
took a strong development stand when the spill occurred i wasnt 
as environmentally conscious as i was concerned about the town i 
was very parochial 
devens 49 is on eight months leave as president of prince 
william sound community college running for alaskas single us 
house seat if he gains the democratic nomination as yet 
uncontested hell face nineterm incumbent republican don young 
i was never officially notified of the spill i started 
working 17 hours a day seven days a week i made unilateral 
decisions which upset the council and angered people when i said 
i did not welcome the exxon valdez back into the port of valdez 
once they got it off the reef somebody put up a sign down at the 
exxon office that said benedict arnold devens 
i lost a lot of friends but i made good decisions and im 
proud of them before the spill the dog leash ordinance was 
what got people riled up most in valdez suddenly exxon was running 
wild we didnt know who was who all we knew was that there were 
guys in hard hats running around making decisions about our town 
 
these guys thought they could do anything they wanted to 
there was an arrogance in the way they went about protecting their 
company that was opposed to our duty to protect our city and our 
environment i had to make dozens of decisions a day i became very 
unpopular with my alyeska pipeline service co friends 
devens says he knows something about tilting at windmills 
with a doctorate in speech pathology he started alaskas only 
accredited community college in 1979 with a budget of 118000 and 
no teachers today the school has a 3 million budget 1000 mostly 
parttime students and 35 employees 
for his campaign he admits he has little statewide recognition 
and hasnt yet raised much money 
i could have chartered my boat to exxon during the cleanup for 
as much as 250000 and used that money to run my campaign but i 
never took a penny for anything my car my spare room my boat 
as it all unfolded i became more and more concerned about what was 
happening to the people i started screaming for reform help for 
the native communities relief for the fishermen 
exxon keeps saying it wasnt much of a disaster we only found 
36000 dead birds they missed the whole point theres a whole lot 
of suffering going on in prince william sound not just the 
animals but the people too 
ive learned you dont appreciate how much you care for 
something until it is threatened attitudes in alaska have changed 
this state is looking at itself for the long haul instead of just 
the short term we no longer trust the oil industry to take care of 
us because it wont we have to take care of ourselves

olearys winter time hes a thirdgeneration alaskan she came 
north from oregon 16 years ago when she was 18 
ive always loved the outdoors and i wanted handson work 
thats why i became a fisherman the weathers always different 
the currents are different mike and i mostly fish together we 
have our own boat we fish for salmon in bristol bay and have 
herring permits in prince william sound 
last year just as the olearys were ready to plant their 
kelpbaited impoundment boxes and collect the herring roe laid in 
the kelp by passing fish a delicacy that fetches up to 25 a pound 
in japan the exxon valdez ran aground 
my husband and i were the first fishermen in cordova to find 
out about the spill when a friend called from seattle at 630 am 
hed heard it on the news i almost threw up i felt like 
somebodyd kicked me in the gut 
mike and i looked at each other with tears in our eyes and 
knew our lives would never be the same the sound would never be 
the same 
three days after the spill michelle oleary was appointed to 
the board of the cordova district fishermen united the oldest 
fishing organization in alaska cdfu has always opposed the tanker 
terminal in nearby valdez at environmental impact hearings in the 
early 1970s prior to construction of the transalaska pipeline the 
oil industry brushed aside cdfu fears about potential oil spills in 
prince william sound 
knowing it could happen didnt help prepare us for the 
physical mental emotional stress and strain to come by noon we 
had 50 fishing boats ready to fight the spill but exxon never 
returned our phone calls 
i think exxon was in a state of denial for the first six 
weeks i think they felt it happened in an area where people 
werent sophisticated enough to communicate the crisis to the rest 
of the world that wed all sit home and let it go by 
theyd say to me its 60 miles away from cordova what are 
you worried about exxon didnt understand that 60 miles in alaska 
is nothing its our front yard 
michelle oleary became a fixture at spillrelated meetings in 
valdez anchorage and washington her poignant testimony was 
captured on national tv and radio there was no herring season no 
spring skiing the olearys finally got to bristol bay in july for 
the salmon run so when they added that profit to their exxon 
claims they earned about the same in 1989 that they had the year 
before 
but the bottom line isnt just money any more the old ways of 
rape and pillage are no longer acceptable but exxon hasnt figured 
that out i think they thought if they threw enough money up in the 
air people would say oh yeah thats enough that will take care 
of it but thats not what happened

exxon says it has spent 2 billion on the spill the company is 
under federal order to return to the cleanup may 1 
this spill has raised the environmental consciousness of the 
whole world i believe the 1990s will be spent trying to achieve a 
balance between good ecology and sound economics 
i love oil i love to have a fishing boat that burns oil 
instead of having to row it to catch salmon but there has to be a 
balance every person has to do their part corporations and 
congress have to take responsibility and change their ways 
i will never be as uninvolved in the political process as i 
was before the spill i know now that i am not afraid to be 
emotional and to speak from the heart and i have learned that one 
person one voice can make a difference

lyle von bargen 61 has worked in the oil industry most of his 
adult life for 17 years hes been community relations manager for 
alyeska pipeline service co the umbrella company created by eight 
petroleum giants who built the 8 billion transalaska pipeline 
exxon owns about 20 percent of alyeska 
in the decade since von bargen moved his family from alyeska 
headquarters in anchorage to valdez they have built a place in the 
community his two teenage daughters are star students lisa the 
elder will probably be valedictorian of her graduating class in 
the year since the exxon valdez tainted the entire oil industry 
life has not been easy 
the first month i left the house at 6 am if i got home 
before midnight i was lucky the days all ran together i just 
tried to assist to keep updating information i was working with 
exxon id keep asking them what was going on i took a lot of 
people on tours got in a lot of helicopter time we usually 
had an alyeska vice president or the president here but i usually 
gave the tour it was my territory 
von bargen came to alaska from minnesota in 1952 and took a job 
driving for anchorage city transit then he hired on with a company 
that delivered fuel up and down the kenai peninsula he transferred 
out of a truck cab into an office job and by 1968 was alaskan sales 
manager for union oil co 
im the kind of guy who can get dirt on my hands i know i 
can still do that if i have to a lot of people have never done 
that if i were uncomfortable in my job or didnt like it i could 
leave it 
he still drives 30000 miles a year around interior alaska 
often in blizzards he says its safer than flying once his path 
was blocked by a snowslide 100 feet wide and 6 feet high just 
before he turned around another avalanche buried the road behind 
him in the dark he and a few other motorists shoveled their way 
to safety it was he said the alaska way 
the mayor exvaldez mayor john devens was really hammering 
on exxon and we alyeska took that as hammering on us too the 
mayor got on the bandwagon that we had let them all down but 
thats not true most everybody here the technicians the workers 
felt we did our job we followed the oil spill contingency plan 
every day every day everybody was hammering exxon for not 
picking up the oil 5 minutes after it got on the water it got 
demoralizing to some people it just plain got demoralizing 
but von bargen says attacks on the oil industry never depressed 
him or his family 
ive had an awful lot of people walk up to me and say they 
were sorry about what was in the news because they live here in 
valdez and they know better they know it wasnt like that 
as alyeskas frontline representative to communities along the 
798milelong pipeline von bargen attends many civic and social 
events 
every place i go im asked questions and 999 percent of the 
people understand what happened and say yes it was an 
accident its something we have to live with and we dont ever 
want to happen again but we have to move forward put it behind us 
and get on with our lives 
these days von bargen spends a lot of time escorting reporters 
and government types through the tanker terminal explaining 
alyeskas new spill response team servs ships escort response 
vessels system the consortium has two new tanker escort ships and 
100 people trained to respond immediately to spills 
i think memories of the spill will go away but it will take a 
while for a long time march 27th was always remembered as the day 
of the 1964 good friday earthquake thats the way march 24th will 
be the day of the good friday oil spill 
what ive learned from all this is that accidents do happen 
that after 13 years of smooth operations the exxon valdez spill did 
happen that this is part of progress we have learned from this 
spill learned that it is easier to prevent it than clean it up

a strong dollar in foreign exchange has lately 
proved to be an effective antidote for many of the ailments 
afflicting wall street 
analysts generally agree it is no coincidence that the stock 
market has rallied since midwinter at the same time that the 
dollar steadied after falling in value through the closing months 
of 1989 
the us currencys showing has been particularly noteworthy by 
comparison to that symbol of competitive might the japanese yen 
the dollars value in yen has increased by more than 5 percent 
since the start of 1989 and roughly 15 percent over the past year 
that brokers say helped insulate stock prices in the united 
states from the jolt of a sharp selloff on the tokyo stock exchange 
in addition it appears to have eased fears that rising interest 
rates in europe and the far east would lure foreign capital out of 
the american markets where it is presumably needed to help finance 
the federal governments budget deficit 
japanese investors have done far better this year by investing 
in our bonds than in their own says gray cardiff editor of the 
investment letter sound advice in danville calif a principal 
reason for this is that the dollar has been rising in value against 
the yen 
the profits from the currency gain have more than offset price 
losses experienced in our dollardenominated treasury bonds 
accordingly the idea that the japanese could lose their 
fondness for our treasuries is not supported by the experience so 
far this year as long as the dollar is strong against the yen the 
japanese are likely to do better over here 
whenever the ups and downs of the dollar exert a significant 
influence on stock prices the effects can seem unpredictable and 
inconsistent 
after all american stocks rose sharply in 1985 and 1986 with a 
big boost from expectations that a falling dollar would help 
improve the us trade deficit by making imports more expensive in 
this country and exports cheaper abroad 
why would stock traders now welcome a rising dollar the answer 
may be partly psychological analysts say 
the dollars recent gains are seen as a testimony to the 
stability and favorable longterm prospects of the us economy at 
a time when the world political and economic landscape is changing 
fast 
on a more pragmatic level strength in the dollar suggests that 
global investors are less fearful of inflation in the united states 
than in nations with faster economic growth of late most notably 
west germany and japan 
as analysts at standard amp poors corp put it in the firms 
weekly publication the outlook the rising greenback has been 
boosting stocks via its counterinflationary implications and by 
signifying confidence in the us economy 
the result of that in the past week was a 5789point rise in 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials to 274122 it highest 
level since early january 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 174 to 
18792 the american stock exchange market value index was up 303 
at 36418 and the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market gained 540 to 44216 
volume on the big board averaged 15444 million shares a day 
against 15773 million the week before 
some analysts think the dollars recent rise has carried it to 
overvalued levels they doubt it can sustain an advance without 
improvement in such fundamental concerns as the trade and budget 
deficits 
but for the moment at least currency traders seem willing to 
gamble that relief might be on the way for even those chronic 
worries

like an indiana jones adventure the quest for 
stock market reform on capitol hill plunged into new perils just 
when things seemed safe 
after three months of negotiations a house panel this past week 
approved a fivepoint market reform legislative package that would 
give the securities and exchange commission limited authority 
during market emergencies to halt a highvolume form of 
computerized trading commonly known as program trading 
but a similar senate bill has no program trading provision and 
the treasury department warned the house provision was unnecessary 
and could jeopardize the passage of other reforms 
at the same time the longsimmering turf battle between the sec 
and the commodity futures trading commission bubbled over when a 
pair of congressmen said they were exploring legislation to merge 
both agencies 
a nationwide trade group the securities industry association 
added to the confusion by calling for congress to designate the sec 
as sole regulator of both stocks and stock index futures futures 
currently come under cftc regulation 
it was one of the more confusing weeks in the congressional 
effort to rein in the deregulated securities markets which began 
after the 1987 stock market crash the outlook for meaningful 
reform now looks murkier than before 
legislation to prevent future financial disasters had been 
inching along until the market plunged 190 points last october 
speeding up the senate bill when junk bond giant drexel burnham 
lambert foundered and sank last month that broke a logjam in the 
house energy and commerce committee 
the senate bill would allow the sec to halt trading with the 
presidents approval in market emergencies tighten financial 
disclosure requirements by securities firms require detailed 
reports on large trades and develop nationwide procedures for 
clearing and settling transactions that bill has no program 
trading restrictions 
program trading is the rapid computerdriven sale or purchase 
of huge blocks of securities not necessarily related to their 
underlying value 
the most controversial version is called index arbitrage in 
which traders try to exploit price discrepencies between stocks and 
stock index futures it has been blamed by some studies as a cause 
of the sharp rises and drops in stock prices that have spooked many 
individual investors out of the market 
the house amendment the result of three months of negotiations 
among the sec the securities industry and house staffers 
satisfied panel members who objected to the original antiprogram 
trading language as vague and ambiguous 
the new version would limit the secs authority to restrict 
activities including program trading that previously have been 
determined to contribute to extraordinary volatility 
i dont think its any surprise the bill passed said 
washington attorney russell b stevenson jr a former sec 
assistant general counsel he said the bill still gives the sec 
broad powers that may be excessive 
just because the industry went along with it doesnt mean 
congress has succeeded in resolving the problem in an intelligent 
way he said 
stevenson said however that he thought the pendulum is 
swinging in the direction of a greater role for the sec in the 
regulation of financial futures 
others familiar with the securities reregulation effort are 
disturbed by some of the reform proposals chicago attorney alton 
harris for example a former counsel to the senate banking 
committees securities subcommittee called the idea of merging the 
sec and the cftc naive and irresponsible 
there are profound differences between the way these two 
markets operate said harris im somewhat worried that were 
building up a political head of steam for a quick fix 
the issue will get an airing later this month the senate 
banking committee tentatively has scheduled a hearing on the 
jurisdictional dispute 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
investment strategists looking for evidence of the economys 
direction found little in the latest government statistics the 
labor departments wholesale price index for february was 
unchanged the federal reserve said industrial production rose 
marginally the commerce department said retail sales fell sharply 
largely reflecting a drop in auto sales 
the anemic junk bond market was whacked with more bad news 
financially ailing columbia savings and loan said it would try to 
peddle its 4 billion portfolio of the risky securities in what 
amounted to one big garage sale that threatened to glut the market 
with more unwanted supply drexel burnham lambert the bankrupt 
junk pioneer said it would stop quoting prices making it more 
difficult for holders to determine their value the one dose of 
good news was the governments announcement that it would become a 
longterm investor of junk bonds acquired in the takeover of 
insolvent thrifts 
the newly elected president of the third worlds biggest debtor 
took immediate steps to curb a 31 billion budget deficit and a 
2700 percent annual inflation rate the austerity measures 
announced by brazil president fernando collor de mello included a 
price freeze and a new currency

for the wobbly junk bond market it was a good 
news bad news situation but the bad outweighed the good making 
the market look junkier than ever 
the new federal agency that manages insolvent savings and loans 
announced this past week it would become a longterm player in the 
market for highyield highrisk securities 
the resolution trust corp will set up its own trading desk for 
the billions of dollars in securities it holds and acquires in the 
future although the government refuses to disclose how much it has 
acquired in seizing stumbling junkladen sampls securities industry 
analysts have estimated the rtc now holds 4 billion to 6 billion 
worth 
the government portfolio expected to swell as more shaky 
thrifts go under and jettison their junk will be handled the way 
other wall street firms handle their holdings 
touchy traders worried theyd be swamped by a flood of bonds 
dumped by the government at fire sale prices breathed a sigh of 
relief 
the relief didnt last 
on the same day the government outlined its plans crippled 
columbia savings amp loan association a big thrift based in beverly 
hills calif said it wants to unload its entire junk bond 
portfolio at once sampls are required under the thriftbailout law 
to get rid of their junk within five years 
the columbia savings and loan announcement throws a little bit 
of fear into traders hearts said anthony naylor a senior vice 
president for fixedincome securities at rodman amp renshaw inc 
however he said the alternative watertorture approach of 
selling off the junk in dribs and drabs might be worse prolonging 
the markets agony 
columbia estimated the value of the securities to be sold at 
35 billion it would be the largest sale of a junk bond portfolio 
by a thrift and one of the largest by any investor several 
prospective buyers were said to have examined the issues 
in announcing the plan edward g harshfield columbias new 
president predicted were going to write some history with it 
history is in the making for junk bonds the chapter being 
written now may be about the inevitable extinction of the junk bond 
market as it came to be known in the gogo 1980s of drexel burnham 
lamberts heyday the governments involvement in the market might 
only postpone the inevitable 
wall street has always had and probably always will have 
lowgrade corporate debt to trade but nothing like it was during 
the extended takeover binge in the last decade the business of 
issuing new highyield bonds has virtually disappeared 
deleveraging or pruning debt amassed by companies in takeovers 
mergers or restructurings has become a wall street buzzword 
the nearly defunct drexel last thursday discontinued quoting 
prices on thousands of junk bond issues in a largely symbolic 
gesture continuing a withdrawal from a market it once dominated 
critics of junk bonds and the clout drexel wielded say good 
riddance 
as one bond market analyst at a new york investment firm put it 
from my point of view its been a conspiracy for years
