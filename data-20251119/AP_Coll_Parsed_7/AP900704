life at lenny ungs moshe dragon went from 
sweet to sour after the discovery of 18 suspicious ducks in the 
kosher chinese restaurant 
did the ducks conform with the ancient jewish dietary laws or 
were they treyfe hebrew for nonkosher abomination 
the ensuing dispute publicized in a series of investigative 
articles in the washington jewish week sent the washington areas 
orthodox jewish community into a frenzy and pushed ung toward 
financial ruin 
ung 29 an ethnic chinese escaped from vietnam and came to 
this country 14 years ago three years ago he was lured from 
philadelphia to washington by an investor who wanted the 30000 
orthodox jews in the washington area to have a fullservice kosher 
restaurant 
moshe dragon opened three years ago in the washington suburb of 
rockville md 
the food was kosher meaning it adhered to the ancient jewish 
principles that forbid mixing dairy and meat products and only 
allow meat from clovenhoofed animals who chew their cud pork is 
out as are shellfish and scavenger fish 
ung obtained the required certification from the rabbinical 
council of greater washington an eightmember monopoly that for 
some 80 years has been granting the kosher stamp of approval to 
area restaurants stores and caterers 
the rabbis hired michael mayer as moshe dragons mashgiach 
hebrew for supervisor things were going well mayer understood 
ung having served in vietnam during the war and he introduced him 
to the jewish community 
but last summer mayer found 18 ducks which he deemed nonkosher 
along with receipts from a nonkosher supplier nonkosher meat 
generally is less expensive than kosher meat 
mayer sealed the birds in the freezer as evidence and went to 
tell the rabbis 
tempers flared ung accused mayer of trying to destroy the 
restaurant and mayer was fired 
they did the classic roman thing they killed the 
messenger said mark palmer mayers lawyer 
concerned that moshe dragon might be harboring nonkosher food 
the rabbis destroyed the ducks just in case had they waited a 
simple lab analysis could have determined the ducks origins by 
their salt content to make meat kosher it must be soaked in salt 
water 
when the rabbis questioned ung he said the receipts belonged to 
his cousin but he later recanted became distraught and was taken 
to the hospital the rabbis said the questioning reminded him of 
interrogations in vietnam 
a private investigator was brought in and the rabbis 
subsequently cleared ung of all blame but the pi susan giller 
was unhappy 
the evidence i found was not consistent with the rabbis 
conclusion she said i dont want to be associated with those 
conclusions 
rabbi joel tessler a member of the rabbinical council said the 
rabbis stand by their finding that the restaurant complies with the 
kosher dietary laws ung he said is an honorable man 
meanwhile critics of the rabbinical council called for a law 
granting the state enforcement power over the implementation of 
kosher standards and mayers lawyer asked the maryland attorney 
general to investigate whether moshe dragon violated the states 
consumer protection act 
business declined as customers began doubting the restaurants 
standards after reading about the dispute in washington jewish 
week matters werent helped when regardies a local business 
magazine published a piece of its own about moshe dragon complete 
with lab analyses of the moo shu pancakes 
regardies reported that lab tests found traces of whey in the 
pancakes a nono when the pancakes are filled with meat the 
rabbis responded with their own lab tests saying those did not 
find any of the offending whey in two pancakes and only minute 
traces in a third 
enter mordechai kohler the orthodox food supervisor who 
replaced mayer 
one day kohler was incensed when a chinese cook used a spoon 
reserved for meat to ladle spices onto a fish also a nono 
kohler ended up quitting 
in an interview with jewish week kohler said he was uneasy 
about the practices at moshe dragon including the presence of a 
buddha statue in the kitchen he said workers some of them devout 
buddhists dedicated food to the buddha 
ung admits there was a buddha figurine on top of a refrigerator 
but he denied any sacrifices were made 
the only sacrifice he says was his own 
i tried to follow what the council said ung lamented in 
broken english i want to do the right thing for the community 
my father teach me to do the right thing not to cheat not to 
steal 
but ung said he lost more than 30000 and couldnt take the 
aggravation 
he is selling moshe dragon and plans to become an acupuncturist 
maybe that is less pain he said

when the last finial is ceremoniously hoisted 
atop the last spire of the washington cathedral in late september 
master carver vincent palumbo wont be laying down his mallet and 
chisel for a wellearned vacation 
just because you put a roof on it doesnt mean the house is 
finished said palumbo a short mustachioed craftsman from 
southern italy who has spent the past 29 years embellishing the 
majestic gothic cathedral with stone carvings both pious and 
irreverent 
sharing the scaffolding with his father until the elder 
palumbos death in 1966 vincent has carved hundreds of rosettes 
bosses trefoils ballflowers finials paterae crockets 
gargoyles and groteques for the sixth largest cathedral in the 
world 
soaring above mount alban in northwest washington the 
nondenominational cathedral will be consecrated with pealing bells 
and solemn oratory on sept 30 in a ceremony symbolizing the end 
of 83 years of construction 
but palumbo said there are enough statues and decorative 
sculptures left unfinished from the master plan of the cathedrals 
original architect philip hubert frohman to keep a stone carver 
busy for another 30 years or more 
weve accomplished a great goal but there is still a lot to 
be done he said architecturally the cathedral is finished 
but ornamentally it is not finished at all i hope i will stay to 
see that it will be 
these are days of pride sadness and uncertainty for palumbo 
54 who once headed a busy team of 14 cathedral stone carvers now 
he works alone in the silence of his studio a small plywood shed 
near the cathedrals newly completed west portal his last job was 
to engrave the cathedrals consecration stone 
right now im doing a little bit here and a little bit there 
waiting for the new people to decide whats next he said i am 
the master carver the foreman the laborer all by myself 
palumbo is awaiting the appointment of a new cathedral dean to 
succeed the rt rev john t walker who died last year meanwhile 
said richard t feller the cathedrals clerk of the works or 
construction superintendent palumbo will remain on the job at the 
cathedral which is administered by the episcopal church as an 
ecumenical place of worship 
when he locks up in the late afternoon palumbo said i look 
up and think wow look what we did 
at the same time i feel sad the cathedral has been nearly 30 
years of my life and the major work is done people have come and 
gone and some maybe ill never see again 
when im working alone i miss the others a few times i find 
myself stopping and staring at the wall thinking about the past 
and all of a sudden i wake up with the chisel and mallet in my 
hand like a dummy its a strange feeling 
after lunch he sometimes slips alone into the cathedral and 
gazes up at the huge ceiling boss or keystone where he and his 
father paul palumbo worked sidebyside carving a crown of lilies 
around jesus and mary magdalene my dad died two or three months 
after that he said 
palumbo is the fifth generation of a family of stone carvers 
from the adriatic coastal town of molfatta on the heel of the 
italian boot his father came to america in the 1950s after serving 
as palace carver for ethiopian emperor haile selassie vincent 
followed him to the cathedral in 1961 
a brash hottempered youth trained in the family tradition of 
carving marble vincent sweated under his fathers patient tutelage 
to learn the art of working with the softer indiana limestone of 
the cathedrals walls and ceilings 
for fun palumbo has carved about 30 impudent gargoyles and 
goulish grotesques the medieval depictions of evil spirits 
banished to the outer walls these sculptures of demons ugly 
beasts and fantastic creatures serve a utilitarian function 
deflecting rainwater from the cathedrals stone facade 
palumbo himself is caricatured in a grotesque on the cathedrals 
north side his mallet raised and whistling over his shoulder at 
passing schoolgirls below while a shocked clergyman looks on 
another palumbo lookalike can be spotted high above a statue of 
st paul on the west front its the little grotesque with the 
big mouth he said 
other gargoyles peering down from the ramparts include a crooked 
politician hurrying somewhere with a stuffed briefcase a laborer 
with hard hat and walkietalkie a democratic donkey a republican 
elephant and a 1960s hippie with long hair patched jeans and 
protest sign 
palumbos proudest achievement he said is his carving of the 
dramatic statue of st paul designed by sculptor frederick r hart 
for the base of the southwest tower at the cathedrals main 
entrance 
it looks almost alive like it wants to talk to you palumbo 
said of st paul whose hands grope in the dark after his blinding 
on the road to damascus that statue its the maestranza the 
mastery of my tools

with a regularity that overwhelms 
unloading crews trains are trundling grain to afghanistan in the 
first un operations ever based in the soviet union 
soviet officials stunned an international meeting in 1988 by 
offering 400 million rubles for a un program within their borders 
to supply food and relief goods to northern afghanistan 
un and soviet officials admit the program has been fraught 
with difficulties but call it a success and a good start toward 
soviet involvement in humanitarian aid elsewhere 
you saw the summit agreement on ethiopia said nikolai 
skripka a foreign ministry expert in moscow expressing enthusiasm 
over the new soviet role in un and international relief 
presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev agreed to help starving 
ethiopians with american food transported by the soviet union 
the afghan program is part of operation salam the un 
coordinating office for afghanistan headed by the former high 
commissioner for refugees prince sadruddin aga khan 
operation salam operates mostly from pakistan and iran with 
base camps in afghanistan and an overall budget of more than 1 
billion the soviet component in considered crucial 
we have no other way to get to people in the north because of 
fighting or logistical problems sadruddin said access through 
the soviet union has made all the difference 
the first un field office on soviet territory is a discreet 
compound tucked under shade trees in this somnambulant uzbekistan 
border town the hottest spot in the soviet union 
people often overlook us because we have no refugees but the 
implications here are extremely important said olivier allais a 
french television producer turned diplomat 
gesturing toward the map allais indicated a broad range of 
crossborder operations along the frontier 
un workers channel food monitor health conditions and train 
development teams they are helping afghans combat a locust attack 
that threatens the seasons food crop 
allais also supervises each salam express special trains that 
speed relief to the border 
grain is loaded in bulk at helsinki finland and carried via 
leningrad across the breadth of the soviet union to friendship 
bridge a vast span put up to facilitate moving red army units into 
afghanistan 
trains go straight to a bagging plant across the border at 
hairaton where un officials say lackadaisical afghan crews 
slowed by restricted summer hours run far behind schedule 
some sacks are returned to termez and trucked north to dushanbe 
for distribution across remote border points altogether un 
officials expect to distribute 35000 tons of western grain 
moscows un role separate from its direct aid to the afghan 
government is a delicate balance 
un volunteers help afghans clear the uncounted and uncharted 
mines left behind when soviet troops in 1988 after nearly 10 years 
in afghanistan no soviet un workers cross the border 
food is routed into local afghan markets with no attempt to 
influence whether it reaches governmentcontrolled or rebel areas 
some goes to vulnerable groups mainly families of guerrillas 
most areas supplied from the north are under guerrilla control 
but food reaches both sides un officials said 
the soviets support the program even though they backed the 
kabul government in its war with the moslem insurgents 
skripka the foreign ministry official in moscow made sure a 
reporter saw a villagers quote reported in the operation salam 
newsletter it said 
when the soviets came with guns and tried to impose themselves 
on us we fought if they now want to come as friends they are 
welcome 
one of the biggest problems is a centrally controlled soviet 
system that sometimes drives un workers to footstamping rage 
each step must be approved by a cabinet minister who delegates 
officials to recruit state enterprises 
in one operation a un official found his trucking contract 
did not cover unloading or storage he found space in a warehouse 
yard but had to negotiate another contract for guards 
one day when rain clouds gathered he realized he needed yet 
another contract for tarpaulins to save the emergency food from 
ruin 
if the offices single approved rubber stamp is taken to 
dushanbe for the signing of a contract business halts in termez 
allais has waited six months to buy the office a small sedan 
with soviet rubles refusing to honor the local custom of greasing 
the wheels with a bribe 
it can be frustrating he said and smiled at what he 
acknowledged was a gross understatement but this is something 
the un has never done before we are learning how to make use of 
this huge soviet economy 
at the same time he said soviet officials took pains to help 
operation salam showing enthusiasm for a sort of international 
cooperation unthinkable before gorbachev 
they have approved field offices along the afghan border and new 
operations by unicef the world health organization and unesco to 
work with afghans 
this is a start but we are anxious to do what we can 
skripka said producing a fat white book of project papers he 
brought back from an operation salam meeting in geneva 
allais is hoping success in termez will hasten followup programs 
and reinforcements he covers the border with a single un deputy 
four un volunteers a soviet office manager and a secretary a 
world food program officer supervises grain shipments 
this is an important step for the soviets allais said 
without operations from here all of northern afghanistan would 
be neglected

america has gone goofy this summer and 
mickey and king kong and shamu 
the tourist behemoth that includes orlando and its environs 
draws 13 million visitors a year and this summer should cement 
central floridas reputation as the nations favorite vacation 
destination 
universal studios florida a glitzy hightech version of the 
california attraction opened officially june 7 and is expected to 
be a strong competitor to the yearold disneymgm studios 
either of the two movie parks would be the largest attraction 
almost anywhere else but here they stand in the shadow of disney 
world with its epcot center and stand shoulder to shoulder with 
sea world cypress gardens and other older tourist attractions 
of course not everyone can go to disney world if they did 
the lines would rival the queues that form for just about any 
staple in moscow 
so come vacation time this summer some will go to their nearest 
beaches some will flee to the mountains some will stay at home 
and avoid doing the home projects they had planned 
but some will join the crowds who flock to the popular vacation 
spots 
what follows is a tour of a few of those spots as selected by 
voit gilmore president of the american society of travel agents

june july and august traditionally are the heavy months for 
hawaiian tourism and this year officials expect an increase of 3 
to 5 percent in the number of visitors says gene cotter of the 
hawaii visitors bureau 
this is not ascribed to any new attractions no one has built a 
kilauea adventure ride with mock lava spewing on appreciative 
mainlanders 
firsttime visitors about 47 percent of the traffic usually 
zero in on oahu the main island and possibly one other island 
cotter said their agenda is sightseeing luaus are still big 
and some beach time 
the outer islands are prized by repeat visitors there are few 
tourist attractions instead vacationers must be satisfied with 
the lush beauty of tropical islands 
they really are beautiful places says mike foley of the 
polynesian cultural center

forget yosemite forget yellowstone great smoky mountains 
national park is the most popular national park in the country 
drawing 85 million visitors last year 
this partly due to an accident of geography the park is within 
a twoday drive of half the nations population 
but it also is testament to the parks 520000 acres straddling 
the tennesseenorth carolina border its 16 6000foot mountains 
its 975 miles of hiking trails including 70 miles of the 
appalachian trail and 700 miles of fishable streams 
it is hard to believe that a park of this size could be crowded 
but spokeswoman nancy gray said popular campsites are fully booked 
on weekends a month in advance and traffic on the two main roads 
is growing 
a high percentage of our visitors are the kind who stay in the 
car and do a windshield experience she said

in new york theyre flocking to see the market that crashed in 
1987 in alaska vacationers are boarding sightseeing boats that 
will take them to the site of another disaster bligh reef where 
the tanker exxon valdez went aground last year 
the resulting spill frightened the alaskan tourist industry 
visitors had declined by 40000 a year in 1987 and 1988 and there 
was reason to believe tourism would join wildlife and the shoreline 
as victims of the black goop 
it didnt happen exxon poured thousands of dollars into tourism 
advertising to counteract the pictures of polluted alaska and the 
state launched a successful campaign to explain the size of alaska 
and point out the many uncontaminated places 
tourism rebounded to the level of 1986 when more than three 
quarters of a million visitors came to alaska 
more than half of the alaska visitors arrive with a package or 
charter tour 
typically these include lodging at anchorage a train ride 
north to denali national park to see north americas highest peak 
mount mckinley a prince william sound boat tour to see glaciers 
flightseeing seeing alaska by air from small planes and 
fishing excursions to the kenai river or south central bays

germans racing toward unification are 
anything but united over what city to make their capital this 
dowdy seat of the wests government or the vibrant but tainted 
berlin once hub of hitlers third reich 
the issue has turned into one of the most sensitive to be 
resolved in the frenzied work to join the two german states 
it will be the last question decided said dieter vogel the 
deputy government spokesman in bonn 
some bonn residents are lobbying hard to make their city which 
is already the capital of west germany the government seat of a 
united nation some bumper stickers seen around the city proclaim 
ja zu bonn yes to bonn 
bonns supporters say this city symbolizes a democratic and 
peaceful germany they argue that berlin is a bad choice because it 
was capital of imperialistic prussia and hitlers germany 
however berlins supporters sport their own stickers saying 
berlin hauptstadt deutschlands berlin germanys capital 
the list of leaders backing berlin the symbol of germanys 
postwar division grows almost daily it includes west german 
president richard von weizsaecker east german prime minister 
lothar de maiziere and willy brandt the charismatic former west 
german chancellor and exmayor of west berlin 
several polls indicate a majority of germans also favor berlin 
which lies in east germany about 100 miles from the wests border 
although west german chancellor helmut kohl has said he favors 
berlin the governments official position is that the final 
decision must come from the new german parliament expected to be 
seated after allgerman elections proposed for december 
bonn is not giving up without a fight 
our chances are good said bonn mayor hans daniels it is 
of course a battle of david against goliath but history teaches 
that david can win 
a majority of the ministerpresidents of the 11 west german 
states also say they want bonn to remain capital or at least the 
seat of government the bild am sonntag newspaper reported 
the issue involves more than civic pride the economic impact on 
the bonn area would be enormous if the capital is relocated said 
klaus rauen bonns deputy city manager 
he gave no specific figure but he said about a third of the 
local residents are directly dependent on the government 126 
embassies political parties and lobbying thousands of others in 
businesses ranging from restaurants to local shops make their 
livelihood from governmentrelated business 
in addition rauen said the actual cost of moving the government 
would be at least 30 billion bonn proponents say the money could 
be better spent helping to bring east germanys crippled economy up 
to western standards 
the bonnorberlin debate also touches another deeper level of 
the german psyche 
bonn made provisional capital when west germany was founded 
in 1949 lies along the rhine river and seems to take its rhythms 
from the slowmoving river 
the citys population is about 290000 but the greater bonn 
area which has expanded over the years to dozens of little 
villages has about 450000 
a united berlin would have a population of about 3 million long 
a cultural mecca and counterculture haven berlin has an intriguing 
mix of ethnic groups a vivacious night life grand architecture a 
famous symphony and deep historical resonances 
but its history has provided fodder for bonns advocates 
we the germans carry a heavy historical burden said 
rauen who is coordinating bonns quiet crusade to retain the 
capital we know that the imperialistic hegemonial claim with 
which we are still connected by history still causes fear and 
apprehension among our surrounding neighbors 
in the interview he also argued that the success of west 
germany has been built on its ability to develop a balance of 
power between the states and central government 
berlin as capital would have a superpower influence over 
germany he said 
de maiziere however says berlin should be the capital to 
promote the integration of future east german states and serve as a 
bridge to the east 
east berlin mayor tino schwierzina said making berlin the 
capital would have symbolic importance for east germans who would 
feel they had brought something to the union of the two countries 
there have been recent suggestions of compromise one proposal 
involved moving the capital to berlin but leaving at least some 
working government in bonn 
an aide to bonns mayor summed up the citys thinking by saying 
we have got the arguments and if the arguments will win we 
will win if the emotion will win berlin will win

hundreds of politicians could wrap 
themselves in it thousands of schoolchildren could salute it but 
the us government apparently has no use for the worlds largest 
flag 
the 77ton old glory was presented to president reagan in front 
of the white house on flag day in 1983 the president said it would 
be unfurled once a year 
instead the washington bureaucracy gobbled up the great 
american flag without even a burp 
its just tucked away in a big old building thats pretty much 
unused said ted leininger in charge of storing the flag for the 
general services administration 
that doesnt fly with len silverfine the man who conceived the 
big banner and persuaded an evansville tent maker to stitch 
together 2 acres of superstrong red white and blue polyester 
the flags stripes are 16 feet wide and 411 feet long each star 
is 15 feet in diameter 
silverfine and the corporate sponsors he lined up gave the flag 
to the white house on the condition it be unfurled each flag day at 
the washington monument 
i promise you your government will keep it and treasure it and 
use it as a reminder of the greatness that is america reagan 
said before he recited the pledge of allegiance in front of the 
flag 
the next year the great american flag was shunted to the less 
glamorous east potomac park then the banner was dumped in a dark 
warehouse in a remote corner of washington its been there ever 
since 
here we have the flag always in the news people thinking of 
ways to legislate respect for the flag silverfine said and 
here we have the biggest american flag which because of its sheer 
size has the power to uplift the spirits and its sitting in this 
big almost empty warehouse 
silverfine who runs an advertising agency in new york said a 
few months ago a friend asked whatever happened to the big banner 
silverfine tracked the flag to the warehouse 
now hes begun a campaign to liberate the flag hes called 
congressmen business leaders and friends urging them to write to 
president bush 
the white house is looking into the matter but believes that 
displaying the flag is the interior departments responsibility 
said an official in the white house press office who would give 
only his first name howard an official in interiors parks 
department who refused to be identified said parks never received 
instructions from the white house about what to do with the flag 
silverfine originally thought of making a giant flag while 
teaching advertising at the university of vermont he thought the 
flag should fly from the verrazano narrows bridge in new york on 
july 4 1976 for the bicentennial 
silverfine had a flag made and strung from the bridge on june 
28 but it didnt last a day it just blew to shreds he said 
photographs of the tattered flag brought a flood of donations 
for a replacement 
the great american flag 22 percent larger than its predecessor 
was pieced together in evansville by 350 anchor industries workers 
who donated their time it took six weeks to finish 
the flag first was displayed in evansville in 1980 then it was 
taken to 20 cities heralded by marching bands schoolchildren and 
politicians 
the flag was laid out in front of the washington monument in 
1980 it welcomed the 44 americans held hostage in iran when they 
landed on home soil in 1981 
unable to raise enough money to build a monument for the flag in 
washington silverfine turned it over to the white house 
i took it for granted everything would be fine he said i 
regret that now

members of congress say they want assurances 
from the energy department that dramatic cost increases in cleaning 
up nuclear weapons waste will yield a safer environment not bigger 
profits for contractors 
the department said tuesday it will take about 50 percent more 
money and twice as many people as earlier projected to clean up 
radioactive waste at weapons plants over the next five years 
i think there is support on the capitol hill for this but 
people are going to start asking what is being cleaned up what is 
being accomplished rep norm dicks dwash said tuesday 
i worry about how much of the money is going into the pockets 
of the contractors and how much actual cleanup is being done he 
said 
the report said cleanup will cost about 6 billion in each of 
the next five years it said the extra costs mostly resulted from 
the discovery of additional waste as well as tougher regulations 
that make the government and its contractors more vulnerable to 
lawsuits 
the revised fiveyear total through fiscal year 1995 will exceed 
286 billion compared with the 195 billion the energy 
department estimated in november the report said 
the price tag for 19921996 totals 316 billion an estimate 
that had not been available previously the general accounting 
office an investigative arm of congress has predicted the overall 
cleanup bill will total 150 billion to 200 billion over the next 
30 years 
there is nothing close to the required infrastructure 
available to manage and implement these solutions the doe report 
said adding that all of the departments program offices were 
understaffed 
it said cleanup staff should be increased from 437 fulltime 
employees to more than 1000 adding that the demand for personnel 
could easily take a decade to supply 
leo duffy director of does office of environmental restoration 
and waste management said some of the costs may have been inflated 
for planning purposes and that the department will be seeking ways 
to reduce them 
but he also noted that costs could rise as scientists discover 
additional contaminants produced at plants since world war ii 
i hope everyone realizes we are at the embryonic stage of 
developing a plan to try to solve a 40year backlog about 75 
percent of the program is remedial investigation which means we 
are looking at each site to determine what the problems are he 
said 
rep tom bevill dala chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees doe said lawmakers are not going to 
just throw money at the problem 
but i think congress will be very supportive of anything 
dealing with the environment in this decade because our track 
record has not been so good in the past and people are now starting 
to realize it he said 
sen john glenn dohio whose attention to the issue has been 
credited with much of the departments recent activity said he was 
not the least bit surprised by the escalating costs 
after all this is a problem that has been ignored for 40 
years he said this is a problem that should have priority 
because it is the most dangerous we have to make a start set 
priorities and get going 
doe clearly needs more money to deal with the problem but 
they also need more people who are skilled and talented enough to 
handle the problem said rep john spratt jr dsc chairman 
of a special house armed services committee task force on nuclear 
weapons 
in a few years if the department has no real fruit to show 
for all its expenditures the support might fall off he said

golfing with george bush is no 
leisurely affair its golf on the go from the first tee to the 
18th green a frenetic form of recreation that the local club pro 
jokingly refers to as cart polo 
the president who jets off tonight for the nato summit in 
london golfed four days out of the past five as part of a 
recreational regimen to get in shape for the diplomatic 
marathon ahead 
he also logged ample time on the tennis court outside his 
oceanfront home and took his speedboat fidelity out for daily spins 
on the atlantic 
but golf has played an expanded role in bushs sporting life 
ever since ken raynor handed the president a longhandled putter 
called a polekat last summer 
its been a savior for him said raynor the 38yearold pro 
at the cape arundel golf club 
the polekat allows a golfer to stand upright behind the ball 
instead of beside it and stroke it with the single motion of one 
guiding arm for bush as for some senior pro golfers it has 
proven a cure for the yips a tendency to hit putts jerkily 
before he got that big polekat putter golf was not fun for 
him said willard s spike heminway 57 a textile executive 
from greenwich conn and frequent bush golf and tennis partner 
raynor estimated bushs current handicap on the par69 cape 
arundel course is between 12 and 15 shots meaning he would 
customarily shoot 81 to 84 
a year ago he was picking the ball up more often the pro 
said 
its hard to say exactly what bushs golf score is for he 
seldom finishes out every hole he favors playing with partners by 
best ball rules in which only the lowest score in the twosome 
is carded 
cape arundel is no augusta national or burning tree it is a 
rustic 6000yard links course with only one par 5 13 par 4s 
and four par 3s 
but it has its hills and knolls and the kennebunk river 
meanders through it posing a variety of challenges 
a normal round of golf at cape arundel lasts 3 hours and 20 
minutes raynor says bush seldom takes more than 2 hours and 20 
minutes 
we joke that its cart polo or aerobic golf the pro said 
heminway said bush is fun to play with and very 
competitive 
its really wonderful that he can just shut out all the other 
pressures and just think about golf its a great therapeutic thing 
for him said heminway 
bush started a round sunday grousing that he was in a foul mood 
and finished boasting it was the second happiest day of my 
life after a birdie on the 13th hole 
bush competes earnestly for the small sums 1 a hole and the 
like he usually wagers 
when he headed out monday with an entourage including treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and vice president dan quayle both 
amateur golfers of no mean repute bush hit one of his longest 
drives off the first tee at cape arundel 
no mulligans today were in a hurry he quipped abandoning 
his customary practice of allowing repeat drives 
quayle in fact took a mulligan off the first tee 
doublebogeyed the ninth green and landed in a sand trap on the 
18th the three holes the media witnessed 
bush rose to the defense of his vice president the next morning 
saying that off camera quayle got six birdies thats pretty 
good golf 
despite quayles insistence that bush won brady and bush nephew 
joe ellis actually carried the day bush excused quayles white 
lie saying he was just being pleasant 
it was quayles first golf outing with bush 
national security adviser brent scowcroft on the other hand 
gets called out on numerous bush golf outings rain or shine 
sometimes in nasty weather scowcroft looks more like a hostage than 
a willing participant 
white house chief of staff john sununu another visitor to 
walkers point was asked how he escaped golf duty 
im waiting for the big game so i can take some big money off 
him said sununu

a legal foundation asked a federal judge 
tuesday to forbid earth first from holding its annual gathering in 
a montana forest saying the us forest service illegally issued 
the environmental group a permit 
the denverbased mountain states legal foundation is seeking a 
permanent injunction barring the july 715 gathering in beaverhead 
national forest in southwestern montana 
us district judge charles lovell took the foundations request 
under advisement and indicated he would decide later this week 
whether the permit was legal 
the foundation and 77 other groups representing ranchers 
loggers miners and offroad vehicle users say the service should 
not allow earth first in the forest saying the group advocates 
illegal sabotage against developers of wildlands 
we know who these people are we know what they want to do 
william pendley an attorney for foundation told lovell 
pendley argued that earth first encourages treespiking the 
spiking of motorcycle trails harassment of survey crews 
destruction of logging equipment and other sabotage he presented 
copies of pages from an earth first publication that contained 
detailed instructions on these acts 
lovell agreed that treespiking and other acts of sabotage were 
serious crimes but asked pendley for evidence that those attending 
the gathering planned to commit such acts 
pendley said he had no evidence that illegal activities would 
occur at the gathering but said what we have is evidence of what 
they have done in the past 
in a complaint filed monday the foundation said the forest 
service should prepare an environmental impact statement on the 
earth first request 
however assistant us attorney bernie hubley argued tuesday the 
group would be easier to control under the permit 
without a permit the forest service says the impact on the 
environment would be even more unpredictable hubley told lovell 
hubley said the forest service not only followed the law in 
issuing the permit but also decided it would be in the publics 
best interest to have earth first members meeting at one 
controlled site 
organizers of next weeks round river rendezvous in the 
beaverhead forest say theyre expecting hundreds of earth first 
members from across the country 
pendley said his clients were worried about possible harm to 
timber cattle and other resources 
hubley said those fears are unfounded and that the foundation 
and fellow plaintiffs therefore had no standing to ask for an 
injunction 
philip knight an earth first member in bozeman who helped 
organize the gathering said it would go forward regardless of the 
court case 
i dont see any way they can stop it he said monday word 
has gone out all over the country and there are people from all 
over the country coming to it well meet without the permit if 
we have to 
knight said earth first cannot control actions by all of its 
members and said the group as a whole shouldnt be penalized for 
the actions of a few 
at past rendezvouses there have been no such incidents 
involved he said anyone engaging in it i condemn them right 
now 
beaverhead national forest officials approved a permit in april 
for earth first to gather on a 30acre site and required the 
group to post a 1000 bond and prepare an emergency medical plan 
for those attending knight said earth first has complied with the 
requirements

clad in helmet and flying suit 
defense secretary tom king gave a thumbsup sign from the cockpit 
of a tornado warplane ready for takeoff he was the very picture of 
gritty determination 
he needed to be these are gloomy days for the tornado pride of 
the royal air force 
the fighter plane produced jointly by britain italy and west 
germany is now itself a target of weaponscutting proposals 
in a new global climate even prime minister margaret thatcher 
traditionally the most hawkish leader in the 16nation western nato 
alliance is preparing to cash in on the socalled peace 
dividend by slicing defense spending in the face of a collapsing 
sovietled warsaw pact 
kings moraleboosting visit to the sprawling cottesmore airbase 
in central england natos main tornado training base followed the 
announcement last month that britain has canceled an order for 33 
tornado aircraft 
the move was part of a 1 billion cut in this years 37 billion 
defense budget 
mrs thatcher who plays host to a nato summit meeting thursday 
and friday in london is adamant that the western alliances new 
role should include most of the old she says it should remain a 
defense alliance with nuclear weapons and us troops deployed in 
europe 
president bush has also proposed cuts of 3 billion taking 
inflation into account for a 303 billion us defense budget but 
some congressmen want much larger reductions 
the official reason given for canceling the tornado order was 
the high cost which rose as britains annual inflation rate soared 
unexpectedly to nearly 10 percent 
but the postcold war climate made the decision easier for the 
government and officials acknowledge privately that it is just the 
beginning of more sweeping cuts 
the conservative government is engaged in a major review of 
defense spending it is widely expected to herald big cutbacks by 
britain long among the highest defense spenders in nato 
armed forces minister archie hamilton sent shudders through the 
military hierachy last month by telling parliament that some of the 
armys 75 regiments will probably have to be abolished or merged 
into others 
the spending review is being carried out in secret but 
according to widely reported leaks defense procurement minister 
alan clark has proposed a radical program including eventually 
cutting the royal navys surface fleet from 50 to 32 frigates and 
the 150000member army by about a third 
the cuts reportedly would include phased withdrawals of many of 
the 66700 british army and air force personnel based in west 
germany 
britains 199192 defense budget planned before the dramatic 
political changes in eastern europe was 39 billion now there is 
speculation it will be frozen at 37 billion 
the british cut in spending for the tornado followed reports of 
successive cancellations of orders by jordan oman malaysia and 
saudi arabia that country reportedly wants cheaper britishmade 
hawk aircraft and helicopters instead 
british officials refused to confirm or deny the saudi move but 
british newspaper reports said it could mean tornado production 
which began in 1980 may end in early 1992

the air line pilots association says it will 
ask federal investigators to reconsider their conclusion that the 
pilot of usair flight 5050 caused the plane to skid into new yorks 
east river 
the national transportation safety board determined tuesday that 
the sept 20 1989 crash that killed two passengers probably was 
caused by the pilots failure to detect a rudder control problem as 
well as pilot errors in aborting the takeoff 
the board said that despite the problem with the rudder setting 
simulator tests showed the new boeing 737400 could either have 
taken off safely or aborted its landing without going into the 
river 
fiftyfive passengers and six crew members were rescued from the 
river after the plane slid and split apart off the end of the 
laguardia airport runway 
the pilots union protested the boards decision calling it a 
total travesty and said it would appeal to the board for 
reconsideration board conclusions and recommendations carry no 
force of law but serve only to advise other agencies on steps to 
take for ensuring safety 
tom kreamer a usair pilot who spoke for the union said the 
board should have blamed the crash on a design error in the planes 
control panel that allowed a rudder trim control to be improperly 
set 
boeing played an integral part in this accident said 
kreamer 
the trim control determines the neutral setting for the rudder 
after the crash boeing and federal aviation administration 
officials ordered changes in the controls to prevent them from 
accidentally being reset by visitors in the cockpit or objects laid 
on the console 
the board said it could not determine how the rudder trim became 
set in the fullleft position before the usair jet taxied onto the 
runway 
this lays a tremendous burden on one individual in a very 
complex system said board member john lauber 
but lauber with nods of agreement from other board members 
said the conclusion was justified because there were so many lapses 
on the part of pilot michael martin during the incident 
martin aborted the takeoff as the plane started to drift to the 
left with copilot constantin kleissas at the controls for the first 
time on a commercial 737 flight 
the board cited the pilots decision to let his inexperienced 
copilot control the nighttime takeoff martins failure to engage 
an automatic braking system miscommunication in the cockpit 
improper use of nosewheel steering and the failure to have air 
speeds called out during takeoff 
the faa suspended martin and kleissas licenses and the agency 
was critical of their failure to appear for drug tests immediately 
after the crash tests two days later were negative 
both men dropped appeals of the suspension they continue to 
work for usair and will be allowed to fly again if they pass 
recertification tests 
board member jim burnett joined in the 40 vote but filed an 
additional assertion that usairs failure to assign an adequately 
prepared and seasoned flight crew was a contributing factor in 
the crash 
burnett said the board did not cite design of the control knob 
as a factor because the pilot had so many chances to discover and 
correct it and because boeing and the faa already were correcting 
the problem

gov buddy roemer says he wont let a 
telegram from mother teresa or a demonstration by 3000 abortion 
foes sway him from vetoing the toughest state abortion law in the 
nation 
the measure approved overwhelmingly by the legislature last week 
allows abortion only to save the life of the mother it would send 
abortionists to prison for 10 years 
roemer has said he will veto the bill because it allows no 
exceptions in cases of incest or rape 
ive been basically prolife all my elected lifetime he 
said tuesday the issue is a bill thats fair and the rights of 
the unborn are important but so are the rights of the living i 
dont know why this is a concept that is foreign to some 
earlier tuesday about 3000 abortion opponents rallied on the 
capitol steps to urge an override of roemers veto the crowd heard 
a telegram from mother teresa and a letter legislators said came 
from the vice president 
i thank you all for your quiet heroism and along with you i 
look forward to the day when all children before birth will again 
enjoy the protection of the law said the letter 
the governors press office said he would probably veto the 
measure on thursday or friday by law the legislative session must 
end by midnight monday 
roemer predicted his veto will be sustained an override 
requires a twothirds vote of each house no veto has been 
overridden this century in louisiana 
he said that not even a telegram he received from mother teresa 
would sway him 
it was a powerful message roemer said of the telegram 
it read i urge your assistance in protecting all of gods 
children please know every child is from god and if they dont 
want them i will take them 
about 50 abortionrights activists including norma mccorvey 
the jane roe of the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
recognizing the right to an abortion held a news conference at the 
capitol against the measure 
if the governor vetoes this bill i urge the state legislature 
not to override his veto said mccorvey the sisterhood is 
strong and very committed here in louisiana

mikhail s gorbachev is drawing unprecedented 
attacks from all shades of reds at a turbulent communist party 
congress but even his critics say they will vote to keep him in 
the top party job 
if we have to vote i shall vote for gorbachev simply because 
there is no other alternative said delegate vitaly g karpenko 
echoing a sentiment heard across the spectrum in the kremlin palace 
of congresses 
the 28th congress of the soviet communist party is expected to 
elect the party general secretary before it adjourns sometime next 
week and the smart rubles are riding on gorbachev who first won 
the job five years ago 
hardliners and radical reformers are gravitating toward 
gorbachev because both sides believe only he can prevent the 
disintegration of the party 
some more philosophical delegates also say that despite 
gorbachevs reforms the party seems to have room at the top for 
just one major figure 
gorbachevs most prominent hardline critic politburo member 
yegor k ligachev said in nationally televised address two weeks 
ago that gorbachev should not continue to hold the government post 
of president and at the same time head the communist party 
but on tuesday in a blistering critique of gorbachevs reforms 
ligachev carefully avoided a personal attack on the soviet leader 
and did not repeat his demand to elect someone who could devote 
full time to party work 
kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov who followed ligachevs lead 
in attacking the reform movement nevertheless told reporters he 
would back gorbachev for general secretary 
karpenko a reformer also criticized gorbachev for combining 
the posts of president and party leader and said gorbachevs 
position is not radical enough 
however he added it is gorbachev who will be able to 
consolidate the country 
i cant name any other candidate now said karpenko a 
newspaper editor from kiev 
it is a great fault of the system that we do not have other 
leaders if there is one leader all the others have to stay in the 
shadows he said 
valentin a gaivopovski a worker from the ukrainian city of 
mariupol also said he planned to back gorbachev despite 
reservations 
we do not have another leader of the same caliber 
gaivoposki said appearing with karpenko at a news conference 
tuesday by ukrainian delegates 
i think we will probably reelect gorbachev although i think 
that as a person he is probably not without his mistakes and 
defects said gaivopovski 
he praised gorbachevs political qualities but faulted his 
ability to see through flattery to spot fraud and deceit i 
think that gorbachev as a leader is very onesided 
on the floor of the congress delegates relied on gorbachev to 
navigate the relatively unfamiliar shoals of democracy 
they chose gorbachev by a 31661046 margin to be chairman of 
the party rules committee a body that will guide the outcome of 
the congress 
by contrast ligachev won a similar vote to head the agriculture 
committee by the slimmer margin of 22331963 
delegates also favored gorbachev when they demanded the removal 
of the acting congress chairman byelorussian communist party chief 
yefrem sokolov accusing sokolov of ignoring their wishes 
gorbachev told agitated delegates to calm down and said there 
was no need for a formal vote to replace sokolov 
if you think we need a different person we can replace him 
with a more experienced person gorbachev said 
delegates cheered 
if you allow perhaps ill change places with him he 
continued 
delegates cheered again 
gorbachev exchanged places with a shamefaced sokolov then 
began to manipulate delegates balking at his wishes on minor 
proposals 
at first gorbachev scolded unruly members but managed to 
change mood and nudged them along with jokes and laughter 
asked to explain gorbachevs appeal alexander frolov first 
secretary of the surovsky region near the central russian city of 
tula said we have no other leader with more potential than 
mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev 
pressed to explain the mixed attitude to gorbachev frolov fell 
back on an old russian proverb he who works is scolded

two israelis who claimed they trained colombians to 
use firearms have been charged with attempting to smuggle 122 
highquality semiautomatic pistols to south america federal agents 
said tuesday 
the israelis brothers geri and shlomi bentov both of miami 
had been secretly shipping weapons overseas for some time said 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms supervisor ron mitchell 
also arrested in the case were two venezuelans rodrigo 
fernandez and ilio ulivi of caracas who allegedly received the 
pistols from the israelis on monday all four face charges of 
violating gun and export control laws 
this was an ongoing enterprise this was not the first 
shipment mitchell said from the records i observed it was 
the whole gamut of rifles and handguns 
investigators said they were not sure how many firearms were 
smuggled or how long the ring had existed because many of the 
records are coded in computers at the israelis office 
at one point mitchell said the israelis told undercover 
investigators they were training colombians in firearms use but 
the agent could not say if they had any connection to the cocaine 
cartels he said they did not appear to have any connection to 
another israeli lt col yair klein who fled colombia after being 
videotaped training alleged medellin cartel gunmen 
meanwhile an assault rifle seized in the arrest last year of 
four suspected assassins of colombian presidential candidate luis 
carlos galanhas has been traced by us authorities to an official 
israeli arms shipment new york newsday reported 
although supposedly destined for the defense forces of the 
caribbean island of antigua a cache of guns from the shipment was 
discovered earlier this year on a ranch owned by the late colombian 
drug boss jose rodriguez gacha newsday said today 
the israeli government has maintained that it followed its 
normal procedure in the 353700 sale of 500 galil rifles and uzi 
machine pistols and 200000 rounds of ammunition to the 90man 
antigua defense force and that it does not know how the weapons 
were obtained by gacha antigua said it never purchased the 
weapons newsday said 
colombian officials are investigating the israelimade galil 
762mm assault rifle in connection with the aug 18 slaying of 
galan according to colombian authorities and law enforcement 
documents cited by newsday 
the weapon was one of several firearms and explosives discovered 
by the colombian police and military in two bogota safehouses when 
they arrested the four suspected assassins on sept 21 the 
newspaper said 
the four men accused in the miami arms case appeared tuesday 
before us magistrate linnea johnson who ordered the two 
venezuelans held without bond for a hearing friday the bentovs 
each were granted a 350000 bond but could not immediately make 
bail all four were being held at the metropolitan correctional 
center outside of miami 
the guns confiscated monday included 101 glock and 21 beretta 
semiautomatics both equipped with 15shot clips and both weapons 
of choice in many us law enforcement agencies 
we just dont see saturday night specials anymore said atf 
spokesman bruce snyder because of the money available in the 
narcotics trafficking we see glocks and berettas high quality 
highcaliber firearms 
the bentovs using their importexport company express spare 
parts amp equipment inc bought the weapons from a legal licensed 
dealer in miami that the atf would not disclose but neither they 
nor the venezuelans had licenses to sell or export weapons 
mitchell said 
the guns were bought for 46500 but on the south american 
black market were worth approximately 200000 the atf said while 
the bentovs indicated the guns were going by boat to colombia the 
two venezuelans said the weapons were first headed to their 
homeland 
florida has long been a source for illegal weapons flowing to 
colombia said snyder who estimated thousands and thousands of 
guns end up in that south american country many in the hands of 
drug traffickers 
a recent random check of 158 guns confiscated in colombian 
during 1989 found that 85 weapons or 54 percent originated in 
florida 
traditionally it has been dope in guns out and this is 
another example of guns being exported from florida said snyder

former federal prosecutor rudolph giuliani 
guaranteed a conviction against ferdinand marcos in the case 
that ended with the acquittals of his widow and adnan khashoggi 
a state department document obtained by the associated press on 
tuesday said the us justice department had concluded the 
evidence is sufficient to prevail giuliani has guaranteed 
success 
the former philippine president died in september before the 
case went to trial but imelda marcos and khashoggi were acquitted 
monday of fraud and racketeering charges 
mrs marcos had been charged with helping loot the philippine 
treasury of 222 million and secretly buy real estate art and 
jewelry khashoggi a saudi financier had been charged with 
helping her conceal real estate purchases 
the state department memorandum said giuliani believed the 
evidence was so strong that there was no reason to offer marcos a 
plea bargain 
the 1988 document did not mention mrs marcos or khashoggi 
giuliani left his post as us attorney in january 1989 and lost 
the mayoral race to david dinkins last november 
now at a law firm giuliani did not return a phone call tuesday 
a secretary said it is his policy not to comment on cases from his 
tenure as us attorney 
after the verdicts mrs marcos joined khashoggi 54 at a noisy 
victory party in a restaurant complete with arab food champagne 
two bands belly dancers a whirling dervish act and a huge cake to 
mark mrs marcos 61st birthday which was monday 
mrs marcos famous for singing to her guests at parties joined 
in a duet of ako ay pilipino i am a filipino with imelda 
papin a popular philippines singer who left the country after the 
marcoses ouster in 1986 
mrs marcos went to sleep around dawn said one of her lawyers 
benjamin cassiday 
on tuesday she left for the hillsborough nj home of her 
friend doris duke the tobacco heiress who loaned her a new york 
city apartment during the threemonth trial 
the acquittal touched off speculation that mrs marcos might 
return home and even mount a political challenge to president 
corazon aquino who replaced marcos 
but aquino said her government still considered mrs marcos a 
security threat and would not allow her back 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said a 1989 order by the immigration and naturalization service 
barring mrs marcos from leaving the country remains in effect he 
said the ban was based on the potential for destabilizing 
activity should she return to manila 
khashoggi meanwhile headed to palm beach fla and planned to 
fly to france and then to saudi arabia to visit islams holiest 
shrine at mecca

stolen from the federal laboratory to buy illegal drugs said in

27528 items 
the study is based on an inventory conducted last january the 
gao said 
chemicals that could be used to make drugs are stocked at the 
nuclear weapons research and development facility but the gao said 
it could not identify any losses of such chemicals 
the gao said it could not confirm whether the laboratory was 
missing any highly explosive materials and could say only that the 
loss from the labs inventory of 102 million in precious metals 
was low 
missing items from livermore the gao said total about 16 
percent of the property listed in the laboratory inventory it 
noted many items are not listed in the inventory so losses from 
this group could not be confirmed

schools in los angeles minneapolis and rochester 
ny will be transformed into professional practice schools 
where fledgling teachers will get close detailed attention instead 
of the usual sinkorswim training 
the initiative was announced tuesday by the american federation 
of teachers at the 744000member unions annual convention 
the schools selected by the union are norwood elementary in los 
angeles henry high school in minneapolis and marshall high school 
in rochester 
each school will receive 30000 in grants from the exxon 
education foundation 
starting next fall the schools will operate on much the same 
philosophy as teaching hospitals in the training of doctors said 
bruce goldberg codirector of the 2yearold aft center for 
restructuring 
currently most teacher trainees get sinkorswim training with 
occasional help from a mentor teacher 
the professional practice school model will give student 
teachers the opportunity to work in a clinical training site that 
supports collegiality and inquiry for students and teachers said 
aft president albert shanker 
the notion of transforming schools into teacher training centers 
has been supported by several teacher colleges in recent years 
said goldberg about 25 to 30 such collaborations have sprung up in 
the last couple of years he said 
but this represents the first direct involvement by the aft and 
is the latest element in the unions push for radical school change

the communist party has for the first time 
released an estimate of its holdings which run into the billions 
of dollars and its leaders say theyll fight reformers who seek to 
strip the party of its assets 
such demands are intended to weaken the party deprive it of 
its material basis and make it unable to engage in political 
struggle party central committee official nikolai kruchina told 
communist delegates tuesday 
addressing the partys 28th congress in the grandiose kremlin 
palace of congresses kruchina insisted that a new soviet property 
law guarantees that only an owner can dispose of property 
the party said its property was valued at 49 billion rubles 
82 billion at the official rate but the figure does not 
include the luxury dachas and special stores for the partys elite 
it does count printing presses schools office buildings and 
vacation retreats all valuable in the political struggle 
on tuesday communist officials claimed the party has 
accumulated its property with the dues of its members who number 
19 million 
a document distributed to members also revealed that revenues 
will plummet this year by as much as 1 billion rubles 17 
billion largely because the party will be forced to pay taxes on 
its network of 114 publishing houses for the first time that will 
force drastic cutbacks in the staff of 293000 the document says 
most of the partys wealth is in real estate including 5254 
local party buildings the document says the party owns 212 
million rubles 355 million worth of schools for teaching 
communist catechism as well as resorts and health spas worth nearly 
twice that 
the document does not disclose the partys most closely held 
financial secret the cost of luxurious second homes chauffeured 
limousines and exotic groceries for the party elite 
but kruchina did say the party would no longer pay for 
officials dachas 
the most significant properties in the communist portfolio are 
the publishing houses in much of the country the party owns the 
only printing presses controlling publication of all newspapers 
magazines and books 
for example the communist party claims ownership of the only 
printing plant capable of producing newspapers in the entire 
republic of lithuania 
democratic activists who have been threatening to break away 
from the party if it does not reform in the coming weeks say they 
will fight for their share of the spoils 
party official alla nizotseva won strong applause from the 
delegates for rejecting that possibility 
a leader of the progressive democratic platform moscow deputy 
mayor sergei stankevich predicted monday that the issue would be 
decided by the countrys popularly elected legislative bodies 
many city councils and republicwide parliaments empowered by 
popular mandate are increasingly challenging the once dictatorial 
communist party 
the city councils of moscow and leningrad are among those now 
controlled by reformers 
the delegates document says the party has been earning 1 
billion rubles 17 billion dollars a year on its publishing 
operations but it says that the new soviet tax law will cut that 
profit to 200 million rubles this year 
an official at the central committee said the party has never 
previously paid taxes

survey in obesity binge drinking and drinking and driving 
the source is the centers for disease controls annual 
behavioral risk factor survey a 36state effort to measure 
americas nasty health habits the cdc released the results this 
week 
americans in participating states were asked about the things 
they do to jeopardize their health such as smoking staying fat

in wisconsin 28 percent of respondents said they were 
overweight according to the cdc twentyfive percent reported 
binge drinking five or more drinks in a sitting in the 
previous month and 6 percent admitted drinking and driving 
as far as for weight its really a midwestern thing said 
michael soref coordinator of the wisconsin survey whatever it 
is that makes the midwest high on that applies to wisconsin 
too 
in reporting the results the cdc said unhealthy behavior 
patterns vary considerably from state to state 
in kentucky 34 percent reported they were smokers worst among 
the states but just 14 percent reported drinking too much and 
driving in the previous month one of the best rates in the nation 
for drinking this is a very conservative state with a lot of 
religious conservatives alcohol has consistently been frowned 
upon and that has a lot to do with it said phyllis skonicki 
manager of the health promotion branch for the kentucky department 
of health services 
the tobacco issue is something else in kentucky she said 
were one of the largest growing states in the nation from 
the smallest farm to the largest youre going to find some 
tobacco 
other survey extremes 
new mexico is the slimmest state with just 15 percent of the 
respondents overweight 
new yorkers dont have much inclination to exercise or maybe 
they dont have much time seventyfour percent reported getting 
less than three 20minute sessions of leisuretime physical 
activity a week washington state was best at 45 percent 
tobacco is taboo in utah where just 15 percent smoke 
binge drinking is rarest in the nations capital just 7 
percent heavy drinking 60 drinks a month ranged from 3 
percent in north dakota to 11 percent in new hampshire 
just 7 percent of hawaiians ignore their seat belts compared 
with 67 percent in south dakota 
in maine 58 percent have had their cholesterol checked 
compared with 41 percent in new mexico 
and a 17state survey of women and mammograms showed the 
greatest use in maine where 68 percent of women age 40 to 49 had 
had one in nebraska it was 42 percent 
the survey is intended to give states specific data to help them 
measure progress in health behavior said dr eric mast a cdc 
health surveillance specialist the cdc hopes to have all 50 states 
and all us territories in the survey soon

a tavern owner is suing to force two of his 
children to undergo tests to determine whether a donation of their 
bone marrow could save their leukemiastricken halfbrother 
tamas bosze of suburban hoffman estates has asked a judge to 
order nancy curran to allow blood tests on the 3yearold twins he 
fathered if their marrow is compatible he also wants the judge to 
order the twins to donate some to save the life of 12yearold 
jeanpierre bosze who was born to another woman 
curran boszes former girlfriend believes extracting bone 
marrow from the twins would be risky and she has refused to allow 
compatibility testing 
arguments began in state court monday and resume next week 
the fathers attorney argues the potential to save the boy 
outweighs the risk involved in extracting marrow 
when theres a chance to save a young life we cant overlook 
it weve got to do everything we can said edward r jordan 
if the twins can undergo a minimally invasive procedure to save 
their halfsibling i think they should do it 
jeanpierres parents and another brother were tested and found 
to be incompatible jordan said another halfsister by a different 
mother is being tested 
the boys doctor jong h kwon said that after intensive 
chemotherapy jeanpierre has relapsed and that his best chance for 
survival is a bonemarrow transplant the best chance of 
compatibility lies with the twins he said 
kwon a pediatric hematology oncologist at lutheran general 
hospital in suburban park ridge said the risks in donating marrow 
include pain anemia a possible need for a blood transfusion and 
infection 
curran has sole custody of the twins and that gives her the 
right to decide whether they will donate marrow her attorney 
beverly pekala said tuesday 
bosze and curran a secretary had lived together but broke up 
before the twins a boy and a girl were born during their 
relationship bosze was married to another woman who is 
jeanpierres mother

a member of the jury that cleared imelda marcos 
says jurors were influenced by supposedly offlimit news reports 
that the judge had expressed doubts about whether the case belonged 
in a us court 
everybody knew about that alan belofsky said in a telephone 
interview tuesday it was even quoted by one or two people 
asked if us district judge john f keenans comments 
influenced jurors thinking he said id assume so 
on monday another juror thomas orourke said after the 
verdict we are not big brothers to the people overseas it was a 
totally silly case 
the jury acquitted the former philippines first lady and saudi 
financier adnan khashoggi of racketeering and fraud mrs marcos 
was accused of helping loot her homeland of 222 million and 
sinking the money into art and real estate 
belofsky a 41yearold letter carrier from the new york suburb 
of bronxville said nobody on the panel liked or trusted mrs 
marcos chief attorney gerry spence 
he lied to us he lied to us an awful lot belofsky said 
spence should not think that he won the case it was that the 
prosecution didnt give us enough evidence the right evidence 
belofsky also said jurors were aware of keenans doubts about 
the case being tried in new york instead of in the philippines 
on june 20 keenan wondered out of the jurys presence what 
this case is doing in an american court his remarks were 
reported in news accounts where jurors though admonished not to 
read about the trial could see them 
belofsky said the panel found assistant us attorney charles 
labellas delivery bland and confusing 
just as wed start to think about one subject theyd jump to 
another one he said 
he said a consensus of jurors thought mrs marcos knew about 
the huge thefts attributed to her husband the late philippine 
president ferdinand marcos 
she probably was a little bit guilty but there wasnt enough 
evidence im not going to put somebody in jail on the basis of 
that belofsky said

school reform sounds great but teacher union 
leaders from three cities in the forefront of change say theyve 
learned the headaches may be as numerous as the gains 
turf wars with principals and other administrators lack of 
training and planning a shortage of money and even flak from 
fellow teachers are a few of the pitfalls reformers have been 
encountering 
so said teacher union members tuesday from dade county fla 
rochester ny and hammond ind districts that have gotten high 
marks for their reform efforts 
addressing a workshop at the american federation of teachers 
annual convention meeting here this week local union president pat 
tornillo of dade county said an added problem is that the public 
expects a quick fix 
for three years teachers in dade have gained authority over a 
wide range of issues in 155 of the 275 schools 
have we turned test scores around has there been some kind of 
miracle as a result of these reforms no it takes more than three 
years tornillo said 
adam urbanski president of the aft local in rochester that two 
years ago obtained a contract instituting numerous reforms and 
raising salaries for top teachers to over 700000 warned that 
in search of reform youre likely to encounter shortages of 
ideas more often than shortages of money 
he told teachers to expect tremendous turf wars 
administrators believe they have less leadership if they share it 
in rochester urbanski said poor parents were sometimes 
mistrustful of reform they wanted the kind of education rich kids 
get they didnt want to be the guinea pigs for the latest reform 
fads he said 
in hammond a district with chronic money problems that 10 years 
ago was among the first to try schoolbased governance aft 
president patrick orourke said that perhaps onethird of the 
teachers have grown so cynical and powerless they resist change 
having said all that tornillo said come on in the 
waters fine if we dont try reform the public schools as weve 
known them wont survive

a former supervisor at a nazi rocket factory 
where thousands of slave laborers died has come to canada in an 
attempt to win back his us citizenship his supporters say 
six years ago 83yearold arthur rudolph renounced his us 
citizenship and went to west germany amid allegations he persecuted 
the laborers he arrived in canada on sunday 
rudolph was to meet today in niagara falls ontario with 
congressman james traficant dohio who supports rudolphs bid to 
return to the united states where he helped develop the rocket 
that put americans on the moon 
the meetings border setting and the date independence day 
were deliberately chosen to try to build support for traficants 
call for congressional hearings to review evidence against rudolph 
traficant claims a 1947 army investigation absolved rudolph of 
war crimes 
one of rudolphs supporters said about 20 citizens would be in 
niagara falls for the meeting with traficant 
the supporter cindy bendall said rudolph was considering 
walking across the bridge to the united states which could lead to 
his arrest 
rudolph has been accused of persecuting workers including 
concentration camp inmates at the german mittelwerk underground 
rocket factory between 1943 and 1945 
the west german government after reviewing the us justice 
departments material and interviewing more than 50 witnesses was 
unable to prove him guilty of war crimes 
he was detained for 9 hours by customs officials at torontos 
pearson international airport after he arrived from hamburg west 
germany on sunday 
a senior immigration official said the justice department had 
alerted the royal canadian mounted police about a month ago that 
rudolph was headed for canada the tip came after traficant 
announced that he would try to get rudolph back into the us 
through canada a justice department spokesman said 
traficant made the announcement at a may 12 dinner in 
huntsville ala rudolphs former home where 140 supporters paid 
20 each to raise cash for a possible legal battle 
the northern alabama city is home to nasas marshall space 
flight center where rudolph and other scientists who worked on 
nazi rocket weapons developed rockets for us moonshots 
rudolph is believed to be the first person facing deportation 
from canada under a 1988 amendment to the immigration act barring 
war criminals an immigration canada spokesman said 
his immigration hearing is scheduled to start friday but it 
will likely be adjourned to another day the spokesman said 
major canadian jewish groups called for the government to deport 
rudolph 
we think he should have been put on the next plane back to 
hamburg said sol littman canadian representative for the 
nazihunter simon wiesenthal who is based in los angeles 
rudolph agreed to leave the united states in 1984 after signing 
an agreement conceding his citizenship was illegally obtained 
rudolph now says the statement was coerced from him and that he 
was told his pension and the citizenship of his wife and daughter 
would be jeopardized if i do not do as they said 
us justice department spokesman doug tillett said rudolph 
signed the declaration voluntarily after consulting a lawyer

statement in support of popular presidential elections and other 
democratic change for four decades the political system has

secretary general of the opposition democratic progressive party 
we have just had a peaceful revolution to gain democracy 
less dramatic progress was made in discussions on relations with

isolating taipei diplomatically 
president lee tenghui said he would support the recommendations 
reached by the 140 politicians and academics at the conference 
this is the time to act he told the delegates in a closing 
speech 
lee called the meeting after student demonstrations in march 
protesting his election to a sixyear term by an electoral college 
dominated by aging nationalist party members 
most members of the electoral college last ran in elections on 
the chinese mainland shortly before they fled to taiwan in 1949 
defeated by the communists in civil war 
they were subsequently frozen in office to support the 
nationalist claim to still be the legitimate government of all 
china 
the opposition has long argued that popular presidential 
elections are necessary to give full political power to the native 
taiwanese who account for 85 percent of the islands 20 million 
people 
many nationalist delegates to the convention proposed direct 
presidential elections after lees term ends in 1996 but some 
supported an even earlier date 
at a concluding session broadcast live on television convention 
delegates also supported direct elections of the mayors of taiwans 
two largest cities taipei and kaohsiungthe posts are now 
appointed by the nationalist government 
delegates also supported an earlier nationalist proposal to 
retire by 1991 all 800 elderly members from mainland china who sit 
in the lawmaking legislative yuan and electoral college 
officials said a task force of representatives from the major 
parties would be set up to settle remaining differences on the 
democratic reforms 
one unresolved issue is whether the electoral college should be 
abolished as proposed by the opposition or should be transformed 
into a symbolic institution that would reflect the popular vote but 
still reserve a few seats for deputies purportedly representing 
mainland china 
president lee told the 140 politicians and academics attending 
the convention that he would back their proposals opposition 
delegate hsu hsinliang said lee would have to keep his word even 
with an expected backlash from the conservative nationalist old 
guard 
he has issued a check to all taiwanese and cannot afford to 
have it bounce said hsu

italians were shocked and bewildered over their 
elimination in the world cup soccer semifinal reacting with tears 
anger and defiant chants 
italys dream of a fourth world cup title was shattered tuesday 
night when its team lost a penalty kick shootout to argentina 43 
breaking a 11 tie 
italians watched their tv screens in disbelief 
in other countries soccer is only a game here in italy soccer 
is something in the heart i cannot describe how bad i feel said 
emiliano mari of rome 
in turin police used tear gas early today to disperse about 
1000 italians who broke down a gate and attacked english fans 
sleeping in a park witnesses and officials said 
the other semifinal between west germany and england was to be 
played in turin today 
fortythree italians were arrested said turin police chief 
antonio beradino three italians and a policeman were reported 
hospitalized an undetermined number of english suffered minor 
injuries 
the streets were eerily quiet in rome where thousands of people 
have noisely celebrated every italian triumph with flagwaving 
hornhonking processions the azzurri or blues last won the 
world cup in 1982 
two young men on a motorscooter yelled forza italia power 
to italy but their heart was clearly not in it and there was no 
response from the few pedestrians on the street 
three young joyously shouting argentina argentina on a 
street in the center of rome got only insults from passing italians 
many bars and restaurants closed early without the crowds of 
celebrating fans there was no reason to remain open 
prime minister giulio andreotti who watched the game from the 
vip seats at san paolo stadium in naples tried to put the best 
face on the defeat in a tournament his government has spent 
unspecified billions of dollars to host 
there is sadness but a third or fourth place at the world cup 
cannot be dismissed said andreotti 
even before the defeat there had been some grumbling in italy 
about the world cup about the problems caused by 
tournamentrelated construction about the money spent by the 
government to host the tournament 
merchants hotel operators and restaurant owners all over italy 
have complained that the tournament has not produced the promised 
surge in tourism and in fact that both tourism and profits had 
declined 
its true that the italian dream is finished but its only a 
ball game now we can get on to more important things said one 
roman gesturing to the dog he was walking in a park

the communist party congress passed a resolution 
today appealing to disgruntled coal miners to halt plans for a 
strike next week to press demands for more farreaching reforms and 
better living conditions 
the 28th communist congress in a stormy session over the 
partys future said the threatened strike by up to 1 million 
miners could lead to the breakup of the countrys economy 
soviet television reported 
the miners have said the show of force will last less than one 
day 
the partys appeal passed by a margin of 3514 to 354 on the 
congress third day also urged president and party leader mikhail 
s gorbachev to open talks with the miners 
a national miners congress last month voted to strike unless 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and his cabinet resign they blame 
ryzhkov for an unpopular economic reform plan that calls for 
drastic price increases but only minor moves toward a market 
economy 
a crippling coal miners strike last summer ended after the 
government promised reform but miners say the changes have been 
slow in coming 
the resolution also criticized the miners for their mass exodus 
from the party which claims to be the vanguard of the workers 
and for locking party organizations out of the mines soviet 
television reported 
the miners congress in june had condemned the communist party 
for hindering the development of a more democratic soviet society 
saying an exodus from a party of diminishing credibility was 
understandable 
we are workers but we do not consider the communist party in 
its present form to be our party the miners declaration said 
progressives in the party say it is fast becoming irrelevant in 
the face of burgeoning democratic movements in many of the 15 
soviet republics and victories at the polls that have given 
reformers control of the governments of major cities including 
moscow and leningrad 
speakers at the conservativedominated communist congress heaped 
more stinging criticism on gorbachev on tuesday 
hardline politburo colleagues charged that his five years of 
reforms haved been scarred by limitless radicalism 
yet the 59yearold soviet president who has been gradually 
shifting political power to government bodies from the 
longdominant party appeared unperturbed gorbachev won election 
tuesday as chairman of the party rules committee and he joked and 
laughed at times 
across moscow on tuesday night reformers rallied to declare the 
communists irrelevant and demand that they move aside 
more than 4000 demonstrators gathered and cheered speakers 
including moscow city council member valery fadeyev who shouted 
down with the bandits who captured power in 1917 
the crowd cheered lustily at any mention of boris yeltsin the 
radical president of the russian republic who was not present it 
whistled derisively at references to the kgb secret police and 
conservative leaders 
reformers want the party to remove its cells from the police and 
military 
despite the attacks from hardliners and threats of a split from 
progressives the delegates stampede toward the center continued 
today 
a poll found most delegates believe all supporters of socialism 
should rally around the communist party rather than split off as 
some reformers are threatening the official tass news agency 
reported 
the survey also found most delegates alarmed by an absence of 
clear theoretical goals and the leaderships slowness in taking 
decisions tass said 
leningrad hardliner boris gidaspov told the delegates that 
time is needed to implement the partys decision to transfer 
some of its power to elected officials he said local governments 
should have strong executives comparable to the the presidency that 
gave gorbachev enhanced powers in march 
delegates murmured impolitely at gidaspovs speech 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak a wellknown reformer told 
reporters in the marble lobby of the palace of congresses there 
must be a platform of consolidation at the party congress 
he said he was leaning toward electing gorbachev to continue as 
party leader even though he generally opposed the idea of the same 
person leading both the party and the state

a rebel leader in the united states tom woewiyu said the 
insurgents would not oppose a us evacuation of doe who has ruled 
liberia since taking over in a bloody coup a decade ago 
if they can help him god bless him if they cant well get 
him woewiyu said if they can send a hook from the heavens to 
pull him up and take him out fine we wouldnt mind that we can 
try him later 
there were no reports of fighting tuesday in monrovia itself 
where doe was holed up in his heavily fortified executive mansion 
but the fighting continued two miles north of monrovias port 
and further west on the road to sierra leone near the hotel africa

explosives discovered by colombian authorities in two bogota 
safehouses when they arrested the suspected assassins sept 21

of alcohol tobacco and firearms as saying the rifle had been part

president bush said today he would 
look more favorably on western economic aid to the soviet union if 
moscow would devote less money to defense spending 
i hope that given the changes in the world theyll be able to 
curtail that defense spending some bush said hours before he was 
to leave for a meeting in london with nato allies 
if they do i think it will be much easier for the west to 
give them certain kinds of economic assistance it will be a very 
good thing the president told reporters 
bush was asked about comments by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze that moscow was devoting too much of its national 
spending to defense 
some european nations have indicated they want to send a western 
aid package to help the soviets struggling economy bush said he 
doesnt mind if other nations want to do that but he is not 
interested in contributing until the soviets show evidence of 
economic reform and stop aiding marxist cuba 
while on a sixday vacation at his seaside home bush has been 
talking by telephone with world leaders and consulting with top 
advisers in advance of the thursdayfriday summit 
he spoke with the prime ministers of denmark belgium and the 
netherlands on tuesday before capping his day by viewing early 
fourth of july fireworks from the deck of the coast guard training 
barque eagle 
the president is taking to london a series of proposals dealing 
with how to restructure the north atlantic treaty organization in 
the face of the declining threat from the soviet union and its 
eastern european allies 
in a letter to nato members bush proposed abandoning a 
flexibleuse strategy for the alliances nuclear defense in light 
of expected soviet troop withdrawals from the traditional border 
front lines of confrontation national security adviser brent 
scowcroft said 
officials have said bush is proposing use of nuclear weapons 
only as a last resort contrary to natos basic doctrine since 1967 
holding that nuclear weapons use would not be ruled out if the 
allies were confronted with an invasion by superior conventional 
forces 
bush did not directly confirm that but he told reporters the 
general approach that were proposing seems to be getting wide 
acceptance 
scowcroft said the proposals are not bombshells but they are 
significant because this is a significant time he said the 
united states already has gotten favorable reactions from five or 
six of the 15 other nato allies 
the national security adviser told a news briefing that the 
summit will focus on adapting the western alliance to the 
changing security environment in europe including the collapse 
of the warsaw pact the changes in eastern europe and the 
turmoil thats going on in the soviet union 
no longer will there be armies facing each other directly 
across a boundary scowcroft said its a very different matter 
to attack a few hundred yards across a border than it is to move 
forces up several hundred miles into eastern europe to be prepared 
for an attack 
one has to look at the issues of forward defense flexible 
response all the kinds of strategies that nato pursues now to see 
how they might be modified to fit those new circumstances 
scowcroft said 
the administration is anxious to assure the soviet union that 
nato particularly with a unified germany as a member will not be 
a threat 
in addition to agreeing to use nuclear weapons only as a last 
resort administration officials say bush is suggesting that nato 
eventually scrap the 1470 us nucleartipped artillery shells now 
based mostly in west germany reduce or eliminate an arsenal of 
1560 us nuclear bombs deployed in seven nato countries and pull 
back troops from forward deployment 
today the president ventured out on a rainy morning to get in a 
round of golf and show off the selfinflicted wound he got on 
monday while cleaning fish for curious reporters the president 
peeled back the bandage on his right hand so they could see the 
cut he said he caught 10 fish 
bush wraps up his seaside holiday tonight and heads directly to 
london at the end of the week he will fly to houston for the 
economic summit of seven industrialized nations 
there he said trade and agriculture issues will be high on the 
agenda

businesses that use ozonedestroying 
chemicals in this city known for its hightech industries could 
face fines of up to 500 a day and sixmonth jail terms for their 
officers under a new law 
but many companies in this city of 90000 people about 40 miles 
south of los angeles may avoid the restrictions 
im expecting a fair number of exemptions at least in this 
first year michael brown the citys environmental coordinator 
said tuesday 
city officials hailed the measure as a local solution to a 
global problem when the city council approved it last summer the 
law went into effect sunday 
it prohibits companies from using or selling 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs and other chemicals that destroy 
ozone gas in the stratosphere about 30 to 50 miles above the 
earths surface 
ozone filters out ultraviolet radiation which can damage the 
human immune system cause skin cancer and cataracts harm crops 
and disrupt sea life 
scientists say restoring the ozone layer will require worldwide 
controls and 56 nations last week signed an agreement to ban some 
chemicals and set up a 240 million international fund through 
which industrialized nations can help developing countries adopt 
environmentally safer technology 
in the united states some states and localities have been in 
the forefront on ozone protection 
the connecticut general assembly last year banned the sale of 
freon in small containers to individuals for recharging 
refrigerators and car and home air conditioners but licensed 
repair people still can buy them similar legislation is pending in 
massachusetts 
more than a dozen counties and cities including irvine have 
enacted ordinances curtailing polystyrene in such uses as fastfood 
coffee cups and hamburger boxes since industry has modified its 
plasticsmaking process to use a much less ozonedepleting form of 
cfcs the primary benefit of these laws now is to keep landfills 
from overflowing 
irvine officials have yet to determine which companies are using 
cfcs and related chemicals that commonly serve as refrigerants and 
industrial solvents and are used in the manufacture of insulation 
foam and plastic food containers 
our best guess was that 200 to 300 were using cfcs brown 
said he estimated that as many as 100 will be granted exemptions 
because they have no alternative 
some such as hughes corps industrial electronics group 
division are legally bound to use solvents specified by contracts 
with the government 
companies that use solvents to make medical devices are 
similarly bound by us food and drug administration rules that 
certify a specific manufacturing process 
even if companies are granted an exemption brown said he has 
told them we want you to reduce your use and emissions as much 
as you can 
some businesses such as calsonic climate control inc have 
installed equipment that recovers and recycles coolants for 
manufacturing automobile air conditioners brown said 
theyve done a lot to reduce their use brown said

federal prosecutors will get more money manpower and legal 
authority to investigate and prosecute suspected cases of fraud 
the president said and we will not rest until the cheats and 
chiselers and charlatans have spent a large chunk of their lives 
behind the bars of a federal prison 
to a large degree bush was responding to the politics of the 
crisis democrats in congress have become strident in their 
criticism of his antifraud efforts and he has traded shots with 
them 
against this backdrop the new initiative and the we will not 
rest rhetoric ought to play well with a public that indeed is 
suspicious of the overall thrift industry rescue program now most 
should be mollified as long as no one expects too much 
estimates of the cost of restructuring the thrift industry range 
as high as 500 billion and most of that money is going to come 
from taxpayers 
investigators no doubt need more resources fbi field offices 
last year asked for 425 new agents they got 202 the us attorney 
in oklahoma has only five lawyers assigned to 40 investigations in 
oklahoma city bushs proposal to boost spending on fraud 
investigations to 100 million annually is in order but no one 
should expect an early or less costly rescue

the jersey journal of jersey city nj on us supreme court 
ruling against political patronage 
whatever its merits as constitutional law the supreme court 
decision undercutting the validity of hiring and firing based on 
political patronage has the potential to perform a valuable service 
patronage has had as damaging an impact in hudson county as 
anywhere in america 
hiring rankandfile workers on the basis of political support 
or political activity severs the link between the individuals 
success in remaining employed getting promoted and getting 
favorable assignments and his or her performance on the job 
too many politicians have a vested interest in creating the jobs 
people want rather than the jobs people need 
the public especially in hudson county will be well served if 
reducing patronage produces more emphasis on doing the job well and 
less on serving the political ambitions of politicians and their 
partisan supporters

the newsreview roseburg ore on math code 
the fact that a team of mathematicians has succeeded in 
splitting a 155digit number into its three prime factors is hardly 
the sort of news that has most people gripping the edges of their 
chairs nevertheless in the cryptologists arcane world of 
espionage and secret messages it is a major triumph only a year 
ago the feat seemed utterly impossible but researchers hendrik 
lenstra of the university of california at berkeley and john 
pollard of reading england have come close to confirming edgar 
allen poes famous dictum that human ingenuity cannot concoct a 
cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve 
but what practical effect does this mathematical discovery have 
on the man in the street perhaps more than he realizes bankers 
use these large code numbers to move funds electronically phone 
companies use them to ensure privacy the defense department relies 
on them for security 
and governments use them to transmit secret intelligence 
breaking other nations codes produces more and better information 
than all the worlds spies put together 
 
no matter how good we become at solving codes military and 
diplomatic intelligence will always need to be backed up by another 
form of intelligence as the latest team of mathematicians has just 
shown there simply is no replacement for human ingenuity

corpus christi texas callertimes on president bush and taxes 
that runaway federal deficit is finally going to get the serious 
attention it deserves president bush is abandoning his read my 
lips no new taxes pledge that figured so prominently in his 
election and has been the capstone of his administrations budget 
policies 
but too much should not be made of bushs turnaround it may 
sound cynical but politics is one thing the read my lips was 
pure politics and responsible governing is another it certainly 
is in this case 
since he made so much of saying never never never it took a 
considerable amount of courage for bush to change his position 
but the deficit is soaring all this makes it an urgent 
priority to consider taxraising options promises or no bushs 
statement outlined the following package entitlement and mandatory 
program reform taxrevenue increases growth incentives orderly 
reductions in defense expenditures and budgetprocess reform 
this package of proposals by president bush will bring the 
budget summiteers back to the negotiating table and if bushs 
change of heart leads to a sensible plan to reduce the federal 
deficit it can hardly be called dumb it shows that bush after 
two years of posturing on the issue is finally taking a 
straightforward approach neither the democrats nor the hardliners 
in his own party should try to exploit this politically

milwaukee sentinel on nasas hubble trouble 
a lot of travelers have known the disappointment of going on 
vacation only to find their camera is on the fritz but just 
imagine how the people who put up the hubble telescope must feel 
a problem with the lightgathering mirrors has partially 
distorted the 15 billion eye in the sky virtually eliminating 
its ability to single out dim and distant objects in space 
spokesmen for the national aeronautics and space administration 
say other functions of the hubble that are operating properly still 
justify the scientific mission of the venture 
but a probe of the problem should focus on how in the world the 
craft got off the ground with equipment that was not in tiptop 
shape 
perhaps an investigation will show that there was no way of 
catching the defect one person connected with the project already 
has said that the kind of testing necessary to spot it would have 
cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
but the project was 12 years in the making and experienced 
several delays and it is not enough to say that lack of money was 
the reason for the malfunction of a camera that was supposed to 
perform 40 percent of the crafts scientific work 
one report is that one of two precisely ground mirrors was not 
made to specification and the suggestion is that the problem was 
with the manufacturer but the public whose support for the 
project was sustained in part by the promise of pictures of 
neverbeforeseen stars deserves a thorough explanation 
the hope of course is that some of the lost capability of the 
hubble will be recaptured when a space shuttle team goes up to 
service the craft in april 1993 or given the new problem maybe 
sooner 
before they take off a double check should be made to make sure 
they have all the right tools along the history of the hubble is 
such that nothing can be taken for granted

el paso texas heraldpost on drunken driving checkpoints 
the key word in the bill of rights protection against 
government harassment of individuals is unreasonable 
we suspect most americans agree with the supreme courts recent 
ruling that police checkpoints are a reasonable means of combating 
drunken driving 
interestingly our notion of what is unreasonable is sometimes 
irrational 
no fourth amendment challenge to electronic security checks at 
airports has reached the high court yet attacks on planes take 
infinitely fewer lives than drunken driving and airport security 
often involves more waiting than sobriety checkpoints along the 
road 
the effectiveness of checkpoints resides largely in deterrence 
the number of people who refrain from driving under the influence 
because of a checkpoint cannot be known 
organizations such as mothers against drunk driving have worked 
hard to raise the awareness of the routine cost of driving under 
the influence if they keep it up maybe 23000 deaths in a year 
will come to be seen as the scandal it is and more communities will 
crack down 
sobriety checkpoints should be among a communitys options

also benefit from the free circulation of information and ideas

the straits times singapore on developments in poland 
if poland is the first wave of democracy to reach east europes 
shores then mr lech walesa is the triumphant leader riding on its 
crest for bringing about that transformation history has already 
reserved a page for the solidarity leader 
mr walesas underdog antiestablishment and streetfighter 
style may have been just the thing to unseat the communists but to 
continue with the same style now may serve his country no good 
having won the right to dissent poland ironically now needs a 
unity of purpose rather than a babble of voices to face an 
uncertain future 
but perhaps it is unrealistic to expect solidarity to remain in 
solidarity for long the union is in truth a protest movement an 
anticommunist platform of diverse parts with the disappearance of 
the common enemy the true colors of the intellectual worker 
peasant and other components of the movement are showing through 
the mass defection of the intellectuals from solidaritys fold is a 
sign that mr walesa is increasingly speaking more for a section 
within it than the whole movement

violation against finland before the court case began holkeris 
statement was a necessary political assurance that finland will 
act in accordance with international agreements one such agreement 
is between finland and the soviet union on the return of hijackers

hundreds of thousands of pilgrims 
wound up their rituals at islams holiest sites wednesday while the 
moslem world mourned the deaths of 1426 people in the worst 
pilgrimage tragedy in modern history 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said the tragedy proved the 
saudi royal family is incompetent to administer islams holiest 
shrines 
rafsanjanis harsh remarks ended hopes that relations might 
improve after the generous relief supplies saudi arabia sent to 
iranian earthquake victims 
most pilgrims were leaving the plains of mina by sunset 
wednesday and heading for mecca to make a farewell circle of the 
kaaba islams holiest shrine to which moslems turn five times in 
daily prayer 
part of the days rituals also included the stoning of the 
devil for a third time at gamarat aqabah the site where the 
pilgrims were headed when the tragic stampede occurred monday 
saudi authorities were setting up a large area at the holy sites 
for graves for those victims whose families wanted them to be 
buried at mecca 
in the islamic faith to die and be buried in mecca is a 
blessing 
saudi officials said the tragedy in the moessem tunnel began 
when a railing on a pedestrian bridge over the tunnel bent sending 
seven pilgrims tumbling to their deaths on top of people coming out 
of the tunnel 
the bodies crashing into the throng touched off panic only 
those at the entrance to the tunnel knew what had happened 
behind them pilgrims continued to move inside the 
1000capacity tunnel filled with an estimated 50000 pushing 
shoving pilgrims 
many died in the frantic stampede others died when the 
ventilation system in the 600yardlong 35footwide tunnel 
stopped inexplicably 
the accident which happened on the first day of the eid aladha 
or feast of sacrifice was described by king fahd as the will of 
god 
hospital sources in jiddah said the victims included arabs 
indonesians malaysians turks pakistanis and indians as well as 
saudis 
it was fate fahd said had they not died there they 
would have died elsewhere and at the same predestined moment 
throughout the world accidents suddenly happen planes crash 
buildings collapse trains collide he said 
he referred to the recent earthquake in iran where at least 
40000 died the earthquake in the moslem state of iran could 
anyone stop that can anyone stop death it is gods will above 
all 
fahds comments on staterun television came as saudi arabia 
which has spent billions of dollars to maintain and upgrade the 
holy sites faced criticism from the islamic world most of all 
from its archrivals in iran 
rafsanjani in an interview with the official islamic republic 
news agency and tehran radio said it was unacceptable to liken 
the events in mecca to the earthquake that struck iran last month 
those officials responsible for administering the holy 
sanctuaries and the saudi rulers should be answerable to the 
islamic world he said from such incidents it is clear that 
the level of the security of the pilgrims in saudi arabia should be 
increased 
three iranian newspapers also blamed the saudi ruling family 
saudi arabia severed relations with tehran in april 1988 after 
accusing the iranian leadership of terrorism and subversion 
islamic leaders from those in neighboring persian gulf 
countries to leading moslem nations such as pakistan were quickly 
closing ranks with the saudi monarch sending messages of 
condolence saying the tragedy was an act of god 
the tunnel was built as part of a 15billion development 
project launched by the government at the holy sites two years ago 
with these renovation schemes saudi arabia secured moslem world 
backing in 1988 to limit the numbers of pilgrims to 1000 per 
million in each country because of the ongoing work 
the iranians who considered the limit directed against them 
have boycotted the annual pilgrimage season for the three years 
since 
iranian activists or proiranian shiite moslems have spread 
terrorism at the annual hajj since 1986 when security men found 
large quantities of explosives during the pilgrimage 
the following year saudi riot police clashed with pilgrims who 
defied a government ban on political rallies during the religious 
event more than 400 people mostly iranians were killed 
last year one pilgrim was killed and 16 were wounded in two 
bombs explosions sixteen people tried and convicted of the 
attacks were beheaded by the saudi government

the armys task force smith peered through a 
steady rainfall on the morning of july 5 1950 and saw 33 oncoming 
sovietmade tanks and thousands of north korean infantrymen 
the unit had just six artillery shells powerful enough to 
penetrate heavy tank armor their bloody sevenhour rout is held 
up by the army 40 years later as an example of how not to fight a 
war 
task force smiths defeat is an object lesson for the 1990s 
declares gen carl e vuono the army chief of staff he says the 
army of 1950 was fractured by the rapid demobilization and meager 
budgets that followed the world war ii 
vuono says he fears that could repeat itself as the cold war 
recedes and political and budget pressures build to rapidly cut 
military spending 
the survivors of the illequipped task force smith units are 
convening for a reunion in nearby alexandria va thursday proud 
of their fight but resentful of the governmentcreated obstacles 
they faced 
the lesson from task force smith is that there is a need for a 
trained and ready army in times of peace especially when the army 
is small gen vuono said 
named for its commander ltcol charles bradford smith task 
force smith was hastily stitched together from infantry and 
artillery units after north korea struck across the 38th parallel 
on june 25 
on the morning of july 5 with north korean troops already in 
the south korean capital of seoul task force smith was dug in on a 
ridge commanding a highway and railway line about 22 miles south of 
seoul 
the first us combat unit to go into action in korea task 
force smith had problems weapons that didnt work inoperable 
radios no air support no resupply and no maps to lead troops to 
safety once the situation fell apart 
we found out we didnt have any weapons that could penetrate 
the armor on the tanks says william wyrick 65 a retired army 
colonel who was then a young first lieutenant leading a platoon 
the units highexplosive antitank or heat rounds represented 
one third of the armor piercing ammunition available in depots in 
japan 
those six rounds killed two tanks wyrick said in an 
telephone interview from his home in columbia sc 
but less powerful artillery shells simply bounced off the armor 
or didnt explode at all 
all we could do was scratch the tanks and annoy the gunners 
said carl bernard another retired army colonel who was a platoon 
leader with task force smith 
if we had been able to stop the tanks we would have been in a 
totally different world bernard said 
the vast majority of the weapons we carried into that fight 
had been declared combat unserviceable wyrick said our 
vehicles were worn out our radios didnt work because the 
batteries were corroded 
the north korean tanks sliced through task force smith during 
the first hour of fighting and continued their drive south 
elements of the north korean infantry crowded into a column of 
trucks that some accounts say formed a sixmilelong line attacked 
the us positions 
they were twice driven back wyrick said 
but by 230 in the afternoon we were running out of 
ammunition he said they were enveloping our flank and col 
smith gave the order to withdraw 
bernard never got the word and learned of the move only after a 
runner found the command post abandoned 
the withdrawal immediately became ragged and chaotic says 
author tr fehrenbach in his 1989 account of the korean war 
this kind of war a study in unpreparedness 
at close range automatic weapons chewed the retreating 
americans breaking them up into small disorganized units 
fehrenbach wrote they left their dead where they lay and 
abandoned the 30 or so wounded who were too hurt to walk 
of the more than 400 men who went into action with task force 
smith some 150 did not return 
we had no medical evacuation no resupply of food or 
ammunition wyrick said it was especially difficult because no 
one had a map the officers had only a general idea of where we 
were 
the two former lieutenants say their men lacked little in the 
way of fighting spirit but simply didnt have the resources to do 
the job 
i dont object to the way we fought i object to the result 
bernard said we didnt get anything like what we should have 
gotten

four members 
a foreign ministry communique said all personnel other than the 
charge daffaires the commercial and economic attaches and the 
consul must leave the country the statement did not give the 
current size of the embassy staff

deposed manuel antonio noriega and brought him to the united states 
to face federal drug charges 
noriegas wife and daughters and some other noriega associates 
took refuge at the embassy after the invasion some of them later 
traveled to cuba but former noriega legislator luis gomez remains 
in the embassy

government questioned the legitimacy of the panamanian government 
or its leaders the statement also referred to a series of 
unspecified incidents in which the cuban government exhibited 
hostile conduct toward the panamanian government

the united states is quietly improving 
relations with laos as that nations communist government shifts 
from state control of the economy and works to attract foreign 
private investment officials say 
the two nations are expanding joint efforts to combat drug 
smuggling and discussing the possibility of sending peace corps 
volunteers to the southeast asian nation officials say 
laos along with vietnam and cambodia came under communist rule 
in 1975 it was the only one of the three countries with which the 
us maintained diplomatic ties and with which there appears to be 
tangible progress toward friendly relations 
two decades ago us warplanes bombed laos for years in a 
failed effort to wipe out a communist insurgency but the rebels 
seized power within weeks after communist triumphs in vietnam and 
cambodia 
talks on sending peace corps volunteers are still in the 
preliminary stage us officials say with the focus on the type 
of experts the agency could send to laos the peace corps has never 
sent volunteers to a communist country although discussions had 
been held with china before sinoamerican relations soured last 
year 
last fall the united states and laos agreed on a development 
aid project the first anywhere in indochina in 15 years the 87 
million effort is aimed at persuading farmers in northeast laos to 
cultivate crops other than opium 
linked to that project was an agreement signed last january in 
which laos promised a maximum effort to halt the cultivation 
and trafficking of opium 
laos also has been more cooperative in helping the us 
government obtain an accounting for american servicemen killed 
there during the vietnam war 
the collaboration has included inspections in remote areas by 
teams of laotians and americans and visits to sites where us war 
planes crashed 
in addition laos has lifted restrictions on travel by us 
diplomats in its capital of vientiane and on the number of 
americans authorized to serve there 
the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since the 
communist victory but discussions on a possible exchange have 
begun us officials said 
the whole dialogue has improved said one us official who 
insisted that he not be identified 
the conciliation effort has been made easier by a substantial 
reduction in the number of vietnamese troops stationed in laos 
which had long been seen as the junior partner in its alliance with 
vietnam 
us officials estimate there were once as many as 40000 to 
50000 vietnamese troops in laos only a handful at most remain 
they say 
beyond that laos has set free virtually all of the several 
thousand political prisoners confined to labor camps after the 
communist victory the officials said 
perhaps the most significant change relates to laoss effort to 
revitalize its moribund economy the officials said 
laos has been selling off state enterprises and moving toward a 
private economy with a heavy reliance on foreign investment 
the shifts began after laos appeared to be falling increasingly 
behind the dynamic economies elsewhere in the region including 
neighboring thailand

prosecutors said only orange and riverside counties had won 
convictions under the law 
past attempts to gain such convictions in los angeles county 
have failed the district attorneys office said 
because firstdegree murder generally carries a life sentence 
the gang law should not affect madrigals prison term said deputy

as nato leaders ponder the alliances future 
president bush is cast somewhere between margaret thatchers 
cautious approach and helmut kohls pursuit of conciliation with 
moscow 
the arrangement gives bush tremendous power to influence the 
outcome of the twoday strategic review in london as it is us 
presidents by virtue of americas historic might tend to dominate 
such sessions anyhow 
even before the 16 nato nations assembled in london word leaked 
out that bush was willing to consider scrapping 1470 us 
nucleartipped artillery shells and 1560 us tactical nuclear 
bombs in light of a diminished soviet threat and a disintegrating 
warsaw pact 
also the strategic doctrine that has guided natos policies for 
over four decades was due for an overhaul because a blitzkrieg by 
the red army is less likely than ever the allies are ready to make 
the use of nuclear weapons an option of last resort this flips the 
existing firstuse theory upside down to reflect new military 
realities in europe 
and yet even though bush sent letters to the other leaders 
before the summit outlining his proposals there was a lot of room 
left for debate and for decision in london 
this is not a precooked summit meeting a us official 
said that wouldnt bring about the best results 
when the debate breaks out circumspectly behind closed doors 
it is quite likely that mrs thatcher britains prime minister 
will make the argument for keeping natos guard up it is equally 
likely that kohl the chancellor of west germany will emphasize 
that the eastwest relationship must be sharply changed to reflect 
the ending of the cold war 
communism has crumbled it has lost all credibility even 
among nominal believers mrs thatcher told the nato foreign 
ministers at a presummit session june 7 in turnberry scotland 
and yet she said europes future is bound to be turbulent and 
uncertain 
we must keep our capacity effectively to deter and to defend 
ourselves she said you dont cancel your home insurance 
policy just because there have been fewer burglaries in your street 
in the last 12 months 
of the other nato leaders president francois mitterrand of 
france is perhaps most inclined to support mrs thatchers cautious 
approach 
on the other end of the spectrum is kohl backed by a foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher who has taken the lead in trying 
to allay soviet and polish concerns about the impending west german 
absorption of east germany 
these assurances include a pledge not to develop german nuclear 
chemical or biological weapons permitting the red army to remain 
for a transitional period on what is now east german territory and 
keeping nato forces out of that region in the meantime 
the bush administration has endorsed this approach but steered 
clear so far of west germanys economic inducements to moscow 
including an aid package that might be put together with other west 
european governments 
bush did say wednesday however he would look more favorably 
upon western economic aid to moscow if the kremlin slashed spending 
on defense 
i hope that given the changes in the world theyll be able to 
curtail that defense spending some he told reporters in 
kennebunkport maine his summer vacation retreat just hours 
before leaving for london 
gesncher speaking at a may 27 university of marylandeuropean 
branch commencement proclaimed that a united germany will remain 
in nato 
however he also said that the development of a 
stabilityoriented partnership with the soviet union and other 
european countries is the right perspective for the atlantic 
alliance 
genscher is for broadening the role of the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe csce which deals with 
military security economic cooperation and human rights 
the csce process must be intensified and given permanent 
institutional foundations he said 
a new relationship between nato and the warsaw pact must be 
developed to open up new possibilities for the development of 
relations with the soviet union genscher said 
on the nuclear issue meanwhile kohl and genscher tend to 
reflect the anxieties of a german populace faced with the largest 
concentration of nuclear weapons in the world 
this has contributed to west germanys conciliatory approach 
perhaps as much as bonns eagerness for unification 
all these conflicting views and national pressures will be close 
to the surface at the nato summit as the alliance begins to change 
its focus from a military to a political forum 
on the one side there is mrs thatcher adamant that natos 
future role is to remain a defense alliance bolstered with nuclear 
weapons and us troops 
to reinforce this stand britain is replacing its aging nuclear 
weapons with us trident missiles 
sufficient forces and weapons keep us secure not fine 
words she said in turnberry 
chancellor kohl meanwhile agrees that us troops should 
remain in west germany but his government was the principal force 
within nato for delaying the deployment of new us shortrange 
nuclear missiles and in may bush scrapped the program for 
installing new lances 
which side will bush come down on in london 
administration officials prefer casting the question differently 
the united states an official said is trying to provide 
a pole of consensus around which the alliance can rally

the government and opposition defused a 
constitutional crisis wednesday and agreed on democratic reforms 
including a popular vote for president to end four decades of 
oneparty rule 
an opposition leader called the decision a peaceful 
revolution 
a historic weeklong national affairs conference that concluded 
wednesday agreed to give more power to native taiwanese dominated 
by the ruling nationalist party that retreated to this island from 
mainland china in 1949 
president lee tenghui called the meeting after student protests 
in march demanded the scrapping of the system that has preserved 
the nationalists lock on power 
opposition politicians had warned there would be violent 
demonstrations if no reforms were implemented 
lee told the delegates in a closing speech that he would support 
the recommendations by the 140 delegates including 80 members of 
the ruling party and 16 representatives from the democratic 
progressive party independent academics and politicians accounted 
for the remaining seats 
this is the time to act lee said 
many delegates proposed popular presidential elections when 
lees term ends in 1996 but some supported an earlier vote 
we have just had a peaceful revolution to gain democracy 
said chang chunghung secretarygeneral of the opposition 
democratic progressive party we can now organize a new 
government governed by law rather than by a few people 
convention delegates also supported direct election of the 
mayors of taiwans two largest cities taipei and kaohsiung 
currently those mayors are appointed by the nationalist government 
and delegates ratified an earlier nationalist proposal to retire 
by 1991 all 800 elderly members of the lawmaking legislative yuan 
and electoral college from mainland china 
a task force of representatives from the major parties will 
settle remaining differences on the democratic reforms officials 
said on condition of anonymity 
one unresolved issue is whether the electoral college should be 
abolished as the opposition proposes or transformed into a 
symbolic institution that would reflect the popular vote but still 
reserve seats for deputies purportedly representing mainland china 
no dramatic progress was made however in discussions on 
relations with the rival communist government in beijing the 
conference urged more trade and cultural exchanges but cautioned 
against talks on reunification before beijing agrees to end its 
policy of isolating taipei diplomatically 
the debate focused on what to do with the 1947 constitution 
enacted in china by the nationalist government two years before it 
lost a civil war to the communists and retreated to the offshore 
island now home to 20 million people 
the nationalists have since used the constitution as the legal 
basis for their political power 
claiming to still be the legitimate government of all china the 
nationalists have not allowed native taiwanese to vote for a 
majority of seats in the legislature and electoral college 
instead the party froze in lawmakers elected on the chinese 
mainland more than four decades ago 
the nationalists have acknowledged the need for change as the 
aging lawmakers from the mainland die off and the increasingly 
affluent native taiwanese 85 percent of the island population 
demand more political power

prime minister margaret thatcher welcomed nelson 
mandela today just three years after she denounced his african 
national congress as a terrorist organization and said she would 
have nothing to do with it 
mrs thatcher and mandela called their first meeting a success 
despite disagreement on sanctions and the ancs commitment to armed 
struggle against the white minority government in south africa 
they had a very good exchange they agreed to keep in touch 
said a spokesman for mrs thatcher who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the objective of establishing a personal relationship 
and rapport was fully achieved 
mandela described mrs thatcher as warm and gentle and told 
a news conference he was very encouraged by their threehour 
meeting 
there were a number of points on which we did not see eye to 
eye completely like the question of sanctions the use of violence 
as a method of political action he said 
our views on economic questions were not altogether identical 
but we made progress and i went away with the distinct impression 
that the prime minister was willing to exchange views with us on 
the problems that are confronting us in south africa he said 
mrs thatcher greeted mandela as he arrived in drizzling rain at 
her 10 downing street residence just before noon 
some 300 antiapartheid demonstrators who back sanctions 
demonstrated at the end of downing street and chanted as mandelas 
limousine went through the gates blocking off the street 
earlier today mandela urged british businessman to support 
sanctions for up to two years during final negotiations to end 
apartheid 
mrs thatcher and british business oppose sanctions and want 
those imposed by the european community relaxed as a reward for 
south african president fw de klerks reform program 
mandela told more than 250 senior british business executives 
that both the south african government and the anc want an end to 
sanctions and there is now an element of urgency on both sides 
to negotiate quickly so they can be lifted 
we are aware of the damage which has been done to our economy 
by sanctions and we do not want our economy to be reduced to ashes 
by the maintenance of sanctions he said 
all that we are saying to the international community is that 
give us a few months if not a year or two to resolve this question 
amongst ourselves mandela said 
mandela stressed that economic progress is crucial to the 
success of any political settlement because of the disparity in 
living standards of blacks and whites 
it will be critical that the economy grows rapidly and at 
rates that supercede population growth this cannot happen without 
large inflows of foreign capital including british capital he 
said 
british investment forms 50 percent of the total foreign 
investment in south africa and twoway trade in 1989 was worth just 
over 32 billion

peruvian presidentelect alberto fujimori 
knelt before his familys buddhist altar wednesday during a 
pilgrimage to his ancestral home that has brought promises of aid 
for his debtridden country 
residents of the small seaside town of kawachi waited for hours 
under blazing sun to greet fujimori it was his first visit in 18 
years to the home his parents left for peru in 1934 
in addition to his redcarpet welcome fujimori received 
promises of private aid from the region and pledges of medical and 
technical assistance from the local government 
they were fujimoris first firm promises of aid since his 
arrival in japan on sunday 
fujimori an agronomist was a political unknown before he 
defeated celebrated novelist mario vargas llosa in perus june 10 
presidential runoff 
he played up his japanese heritage during the campaign even 
posing dressed as a samurai warrior for news photographers 
it was a very emotional visit for me fujimori said i was 
surprised at the reaction i felt the people received me with the 
same simple and frank hospitality as the peruvians 
fujimori the first person of japanese descent to win such a 
leadership outside japan appears to have charmed the japanese with 
his frank admiration for this nations culture and economic power 
schoolgirls treated fujimori as if he were a movie star banners

hilly tangerinegrowing town on the southern island of kyushu 
elderly residents who remember the days when poverty drove

thrilled kawachi demonstrated its enthusiasm by awarding fujimori 
the towns first honorary citizenship 
fujimori shook hands with people in the crowd paid his respects 
to his ancestors at the household altar and posed for photos with 
relatives still living in the town of 8500 people 
fujimoris talks earlier in the week with top japanese leaders 
failed to draw any concrete promises of aid for his nations ailing 
economy 
but the governor of kumamoto the state where kawachi is 
located said local groups were considering the best way to provide 
private aid to peru 
mr fujimori says there is a shortage of everything from 
medicine to soccer balls said gov morihiro hosokawa we want 
to help meet those needs 
hosokawa also said his government planned to invite medical and 
technical trainees from peru to local research institutes 
japanese officials have denied peru would receive special 
treatment because of fujimoris family ties fujimori who assumes 
office july 28 has sought to emphasize those ties throughout his 
visit 
i am proud to have my roots in both countries he said i 
plan to use the strong blood of the people of this area who left 
60 to 70 years ago for the sake of my country 
fujimori was to leave japan thursday after a fiveday visit his 
12day foreign tour began in washington and will also take him to 
south korea 
he told reporters he planned emergency economic measures to cope 
with perus 2000 percent annual inflation and isolation from the 
international financial community 
peru considered virtually bankrupt has not made payments on 
its 22 billion foreign debt since the mid1980s and is ineligible 
for money from international lending institutions 
fujimori is seeking medium and longterm loans from japan and a 
18 billion bridge loan from the international mometary fund to 
help stabilize the economy 
he said he planned a new currency to replace the severely 
devalued indica utility price increases and a temporary hefty tax 
on wealth 
the economy of peru needs order it needs to recover 
equilibrium in its prices he said 
japanese leaders have said japan might aid peru if fujimori 
works with the imf and other multilateral organizations to address 
its economic problems 
peru owes japan about 1 billion in government and private 
credits

a black youth who was killed in an attack by a 
white gang in bensonhurst was a victim of mistaken identity not 
racial bias according to jurors who cleared one mob member of 
intentional murder and discrimination 
the jury tuesday failed to resolve a second murder charge 
against john vento 21 in what has been routinely described as the 
racially motivated attack on yusuf hawkins 
jurors interviewed after the verdict said prosecutors and 
journalists had overemphasized the role of race in the slaying 
which occurred last august in a predominantly white lower middle 
class section of brooklyn and inflamed racial tensions throughout 
the city 
we all felt this was really more about mistaken identity 
said juror lee levin if hawkins and three other blacks had gone 
to the same section of bensonhurst on any other night these 
people would not have been involved in an incident she added 
race was used for identification only agreed juror judith 
schwartz a teacher if they had heard a bunch of norwegians were 
coming to the neighborhood looking for trouble they would have 
acted the same way 
if the only reason they attacked hawkins was because he was 
black that would have been discrimination she said 
according to testimony at the trials of vento and two other 
young men the whites believed that a group of blacks and hispanics 
was coming to start a fight over a woman who had been involved with 
one of the whites 
instead the whites set upon the 16yearold hawkins when he 
came to the brooklyn neighborhood to look at a used car that was 
for sale 
the jurys four black members agreed that race did not motivate 
vento and most of his companions all they had to go on was some 
blacks and puerto ricans were coming to the neighborhood said 
one kenneth spears a transit worker 
spears said some members of the mob may have been racists but 
added we cant get into their minds so we dont know 
ventos lawyer gerald dichiara said that prosecutors created a 
racial issue for political purposes dichiara seemed to have 
defused the racial issue during the trial by calling as witnesses 
four black men who knew vento and said he was not a bigot 
ms schwartz said the news media also tried to make the incident 
seem purely racial in origin i went in thinking he was probably 
guilty she said but then i heard the evidence and the law 
she said she was so convinced of ventos innocence that she 
would contribute 500 to a defense fund for his september retrial 
on charges of riot and murder with depraved indifference 
vento who allegedly helped organize the gang was convicted of 
two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of menacing 
jurors said the votes on the unresolved charges were 102 for 
acquittal on murder by depraved indifference and 84 for conviction 
on riot 
on the murder by depraved indifference count there was 
agreement that he organized people there was agreement that he was 
there said levin one of the two holdouts for a murder 
conviction 
all the physical stuff was there but there wasnt agreement 
on whether he was mentally culpable 
juror irwin ziegler said the deliberations were not very nice 
it was very tense very emotional a lot of yelling and 
screaming 
vento faces one and onethird to four years in prison on the 
unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing count 
sentencing is aug 14 
he was the third member of the mob to go on trial keith 
mondello and joseph fama both were convicted of discrimination 
fama who allegedly fired the shot that killed hawkins was 
convicted of murder but mondello was acquitted of the most serious 
charges five other youths still face trial

a photographer whose blackandwhite prints 
have been shown internationally became an advocate in the debate 
over arts censorship after much of his lifes work was seized in an 
obscenity investigation 
jock sturges hasnt been arrested or charged but the san 
franciscobased photographer has been the subject of a federal 
grand jury investigation for nine weeks 
the 43yearold sturges said he finds himself cast in a role 
that im unprepared for in being accused of child pornography 
about half of his photographs are of nude men and women and 
their children sturges says the subjects are naturists who 
provide written permission for the photos to be published or 
displayed 
federal agents confiscated all types of works by sturges who 
also photographs fashion models and classical dancers his most 
lucrative local account the marin ballet canceled his contract 
after the investigation began 
im under assault sturges told several hundred people who 
gathered monday night in a san francisco theater to hear his story 
but im getting lots of support from the arts community 
its time to say enough is enough i was shocked at first 
depressed when my lifes work was carried away now im beginning 
to get angry 
sturges shared a podium with dennis barrie a cincinnati gallery 
director under indictment for exhibiting explicit photographs by 
the late robert mapplethorpe 
this is not an aberration what happened in cincinnati 
barrie told the audience warning that unless he wins his case 
procensorship forces will grow bolder 
if we lose all arts museums are vulnerable 
sturges reminded barrie that this is not cincinnati indeed 
mayor art agnos declared monday dennis barrie day in san francisco 
a resolution protesting the case against sturges was approved 
tuesday by the board of supervisors city services committee 
there is a dangerous state of hysteria and repression over 
freedom of expression of artists in the united states said the 
resolution which goes before the full board next week 
sturges says some of his artworks have been ruined since police 
and fbi raids on his apartment and the shop of his film processor 
joseph semien who was arrested for investigation of possessing 
child pornography 
the fbi and the san francisco district attorneys office have 
refused to comment on the cases fbi spokesman duke diedrich would 
only say were very careful when we handle evidence 
in a similar investigation federal prosecutors in portland 
maine have gone to court to get permission to destroy a photograph 
of a nude father and son that was seized by customs agents at the 
canadian border 
the selfportrait by nationally known photographer walter 
chappell dates to the early 1960s and has appeared in a picture 
book of american nude photography published by harper amp row 
the federal governments sudden interest in bringing an 
obscenity case against the chappell photograph comes at a time of 
national debate on freedom of expression in such diverse issues as 
flag burning and the lyrics of the rap group 2 live crew 
the investigation of sturges began after newell colour a photo 
lab notified authorities of negatives of nude girls ages 911 
semien 26 was arrested april 25 after picking up some of sturges 
photos from the lab 
a state law intended to fight child abuse requires all 
filmprocessing companies to report any material showing a child 
under 14 engaged in sexual conduct sexual conduct is defined 
as exhibition of the genitals for the purpose of sexual 
stimulation of the viewer 
sturges lawyer contends the law is unconstitutional because 
its vague 
its a sense of taste said attorney michael h metzger 
there are certainly some people who may find it to be tasteless 
but nothing sturges ever did in any way exploits or is harmful to 
children 
i think hes a talented serious photographer the idea that 
his work is somehow obscene or pornographic is ludicrous said 
peter galassi curator of photography at the museum of modern art 
in new york the museum has a sturges photograph in its collection 
and his work has been displayed in the bibliotheque nationale in 
paris 
im an artist sturges said i am to no extent a 
pornographer

cherokee nation chief wilma mankiller has 
signed an unprecedented agreement in which the bureau of indian 
affairs will give the tribe direct control over millions of dollars 
in federal funding 
through selfgovernance we can better determine the services 
needed by tribal members and fulfill those needs without the 
bureaucratic delays of the past ms mankiller said in a 
statement from boston where she is recuperating from a kidney 
transplant 
threeyear agreements announced tuesday also cover four smaller 
indian tribes they are the quinalt indian nation of taholah 
wash the lummi indian nation of bellingham wash the jamestown 
klallam indian tribe of sequim wash and the hoopa valley indian 
tribe of hoopa calif 
this is a major step toward giving tribal governments full 
authority and responsibility for governing their reservations 
eddie f brown assistant interior secretary said in washington 
dc 
these agreements are historic for these tribes and for the 
bia he said 
the agreements and browns comments were reported wednesday from 
washington by the daily oklahoman and the tulsa world 
john ketcher deputy principal chief of the tahlequah 
oklabased cherokee nation said tribal leaders were looking 
forward to having more flexibility in using federal funds 
the problem with the bia in the past has been that once they

major members of nato go to london this week reluctant to change 
the alliance that has prevented conflict during the cold war and 
the advent of nuclear weaponry 
after 41 years of an alliance pitted against the warsaw pact 
the 16 nations that make up the north atlantic treaty organization 
must rethink how they will keep the peace 
the communist governments of eastern europe that supported the 
warsaw pact have been swept away in the last year by popular 
revolutions the new governments for the most part have insisted 
that soviet forces be withdrawn from their soil and that the 
eastwest armed confrontation be ended 
nato leaders on thursday and friday must decide how the western 
world will ensure its safety and what future role the alliance 
might play 
members will wrestle with proposals to change natos focus 
from a military alliance to a political forum its strategy from 
containing communism to regional peacekeeping and even its 
membership with the suggested admission of east germany 
here are some views about the alliances future 
west germany wants nato membership extended to both halves of 
a united germany and to develop the atlantic alliance into a 
stabilityoriented partnership with the soviet union and other 
european countries foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
has said 
genscher also wants a broader role of the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe csce which deals with 
military security economic cooperation and human rights 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez said last week 
there exists a clear consciousness that the atlantic alliance 
is not replaceable and that the transatlantic link with the 
united states and canada should be maintained 
that someone might propose the elimination of nato would seem 
to me an attempt to ignore the history of the 20th century ignore 
that there was a world war ii he said 
british prime minister margaret thatcher traditionally the 
most hawkish of the western leaders is adamant that nato should 
remain as a defense alliance complete with nuclear weapons and us 
troops deployed in western europe 
you do not cancel your home insurance policy just because 
there have been fewer burglaries in your street in the last 12 
months the conservative party prime minister told nato foreign 
ministers last month 
britain is replacing its aging nuclear weapons with a 9billion 
us trident missile system 
british officials also say there will likely be a reduction in 
the 66700 british troops based in west germany 
norwegian defense minister per ditlevsimonsen is in general 
agreement norway has seen little effect from military changes in 
the east bloc in fact the soviet union is modernizing and has 
moved forces from central europe to its kola pennisula bases near 
its arctic border with norway ditlevsimonsen said backfire 
bombers are now stationed at kola and flogger fighterbombers 
withdrawn from hungary went to the north flank he added 
his spokesman erik senstad said we want nato to stay the 
way it is with germany as a member 
french officials are staying out of public debate on details 
of natos future they continue to insist they will remain outside 
its military wing 
asked about pleas that france rejoin the unified miltary 
structure that it left in 1966 president francois mitterrands 
spokesman hubert vedrine said the answer is no 
vedrine also indicated france has backed away from its earlier 
suggestions that the csce be developed into a continentwide 
security body that would supercede nato and the warsaw pact 
nato is an alliance for defense vedrine said the csce is 
not an alliance we cannot push it as a substitute 
us officials have remained vague about the role nato should 
take overseeing europe although the administration of president 
bush believes the alliance should gradually evolve from a military 
to a more political union in which a unified germany will be 
anchored 
nato has been the most successful defensive alliance in 
history it is and it must remain a coherent force for peace 
secretary of state james a baker iii said last thursday 
with some promptings from us allies baker has gradually 
shifted his view to say that the csce should be bolstered to 
provide a new security arrangement for europe but he and other 
officials see the forum more as a tool to help spread democracy in 
europe and help the transition from governmentcontrolled to market 
economies 
belgium on the other hand seeks a greater profile for the 
csce it wants a permanent csce secretariat as an embryonic form 
of a greater paneuropean security structure said foreign 
minister mark eyskens said in a recent position paper

a pamphlet distributed among jewish settlers 
urged them to shoot palestinians and gave detailed instructions on 
how to obtain guns and avoid capture according to media reports 
wednesday 
the anonymous pamphlet quoted by the hebrew daily yediot 
ahronot and state radio advises settlers to gather explosives from 
the army masquerade as soldiers during attacks and leave behind 
misleading evidence 
it says the settlers in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
should respond to stoning attacks on their cars with gunfire and 
should try to hit and cause much damage 
the pamphlet also urges retribution against palestinians 
you must react to every arab stone with secret revenge acts 
the leaflet was quoted as saying cause damage to arab property 
the reports come at a time of rising tension between settlers 
and palestinians who have carried out an uprising against israeli 
occupation for more than 30 months in the uprising at least 721 
palestinians have been slain by israeli gunfire and 45 israelis 
have died 
the daily haaretz quoted security sources as saying stalled 
peace efforts could push palestinian extremists to attack jewish 
settlements 
liberal politicians have accused the rightwing government of 
encouraging radicals among the settlers 
yediot said the pamphlets were put into settlers mailboxes but 
it was unclear how many were distributed or in which settlements 
the pamphlet was not signed and news reports gave no evidence of 
who printed it 
more than 130 jewish settlements have been built in the west 
bank and gaza since the territories were captured from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war about 75000 jews live there 
among 17 million palestinians 
israel harel a settler leader said he checked eight 
settlements and found no sign of the pamphlets this pamphlet is 
simply not known in the settlements he said 
zvi katzover head of the kiryat arba settlement in the west 
bank said the pamphlet was probably done by a fringe group he 
said however the advice should not be ignored to try and 
catch stone throwers at almost any price 
politicians on both left and right expressed fears the pamphlet 
could be evidence that a new jewish underground was forming 
similar to one that targeted and killed several palestinian leaders 
in the early 1980s 
parliament member ran cohen of the liberal citizens rights 
movement said the pamphlet not only calls for the murder of 
innocent arabs but also the impersonation of army soldiers 
cohen said he sent copies of the pamphlet to authorities 
lawmaker geula cohen of the rightwing tehiya party said the 
pamphlet was madness 
this is really an underground not against the arabs but 
against the state of israel she told yediot 
according to the radio the pamphlet outlines a scenario in 
which two settlers are in a car nearing an area where palestinian 
youths often stone settlers cars 
the pamphlet says your friend moves into the back seat 
handgun in hand in front of you a stone is thrown your friend 
opens a window and empties his magazine he tries to hit and cause 
much damage 
the pamphlet goes on to to say that to mislead investigators 
the settlers should then sprinkle on the roadside empty cartridges 
not from their own weapons 
among the instructions quoted from the pamphlet were 
collect explosives fuses delaying fuses detonators the 
primary source the army 
arm yourself with an m16 assault rifle take the weapon 
from your settlements armory or from your army unit 
when you go on an operation wear army fatigues and a 
stocking cap 
how not to be caught if you use your weapon do not report 
to a civilian control center or the military wipe fingerprints 
from the weapon

a former kgb counterintelligence chief says about 
20 agents who have defected to the west in the past decade have 
caused the total collapse of many soviet spy rings 
oleg d kalugin who worked as an operative in the united states 
from 1958 to 1970 but has since been dismissed from the kgb and 
stripped of his rank as major general made his latest revelation 
about the agency in tuesdays editions of the newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda 
at an anticommunist rally tuesday evening kalugin blamed kgb 
chief vladimir a kryuchkov for what he called criminal 
negligence and incompetence which led to the mass desertion of kgb 
agents and demoralized intelligence 
in recent weeks kalugin has been waging a public relations 
campaign against the kgb through interviews with western reporters 
and in articles in reformist soviet newspapers he has said the kgb 
still taps telephones infiltrates soviet life including the 
russian orthodox church and labor organizations and engages in 
dirty tricks 
kalugin has embraced the reform policies of the radical 
democratic platform alleging his superiors drummed him out of the 
agency because of his politics 
after his tuesday speech which at times evoked populist themes 
that a candidate for office would use many in the crowd chanted 
well done and a few urged him to run for the soviet parliament 
in the newspaper article he denied allegations by his former 
superiors that he himself was responsible for leaks of information 
since 1960 until 1980 three kgb agents defected to the 
west kalugin wrote and since 1980 about 20 have already 
betrayed the motherland 
thus we can boldly speak not of an information leak but about 
a majority of soviet intelligences secrets sold to the west about 
the total collapse of a great number of intelligence networks he 
added but all this is being thoroughly concealed from the 
public 
a separate letter by soviet lawmakers printed in komsomolskaya 
pravda urged an investigation of kalugins allegations by the 
supreme soviet legislature 
at the rally tuesday evening he said his exbosses claimed he 
had been living in the united states too long kalugin said he had 
not been affected by americas material benefits but rather by 
the civil rights movement led by the rev martin luther king jr 
and students protesting the vietnam war 
he also delivered a stinging attack on the kgbs hardline 
chiefs to the delight of a crowd of more than 4000 people who 
earlier had been shouting shame on the kgb 
the people who are now in the leadership of the kgb are mainly 
those who bear full responsibility for the injustice and crimes 
committed against the soviet people and our society kalugin said 
the men in leadership positions of the kgb for the past 15 to 20 
years were chips off stalins and brezhnevs empire kalugin 
said referring to former soviet leaders josef stalin and leonid 
brezhnev 
he also blamed the kgb for recent unrest in the soviet unions 
caucasian and central asian republics 
ill say that the kgb did not fulfill its basic role when it 
failed to prevent ethnic conflicts and failed to provide stability 
for society he said 
years of lawlessness by the agency was responsible for 
millions of lost lives millions of broken lives he said

walker to give a concert in the picturepostcard village of north

walker acknowledged the plumberturnedpromoter by sporting an 
ollingers plumbing heating and air conditioning tshirt under 
his black jacket he traded his beige felt cowboy hat for a maroon 
north east baseball cap 
i like a man who knows what he wants and goes and gets it 
walker hollered to the screams and shouts of 250 fans who packed a 
barnturnedrestaurant for walkers concert tuesday night and 
they said it couldnt be done 
chuck ollinger got the idea of a walker concert so ollinger and 
his buddies could have frontrow seats to hear one of their 
favorite singers 
ollinger called walkers agent and struck a deal that ollinger 
would put half the money up front 
it was a spurofthemoment kind of thing said ollinger 
36 we had no idea what we were doing 
it was either going to fly or else it was going to be a real 
expensive fourth of july said bill neil 36 a grape farmer who 
put up some of the advance money the amount was not disclosed

nowclassic mr bojangles other hits include la freeway 
and up against the wall redneck

guys are carrying six seven eight people around they keep 
themselves out of the market i did that longer and longer with 
less and less money to show for it

perform at a small club in pittsburgh about 150 miles to the 
south he called walkers agent and struck a deal that required

among speakers at wednesdays session of the 
communist party congress was deputy prime minister leonid abalkin 
considered one of the main architects of the kremlins current plan 
for a transition to a market economy his remarks were translated 
by the associated press 
 
the fate of socialism and the socialist ideal should not be tied 
to just one of its models now it has become clear that there are 
more than one and quite varied models of forming socialism and 
the failure of one of these models does not mean the crash of the 
idea of the socialist choice itself among these models can be 
those that correspond to general models of social progress and 
those that represent a blind alley of social development the model 
based on full state ownership of property on liquidation of 
various forms of enterprise and the negation of the market is not 
capable of maintaining high social and economic results 
we often say we built the wrong socialism now well build 
another humane and democratic i think we should be clear that we 
did not build socialism and have not lived in the conditions of a 
socialist society otherwise well have to admit that a society in 
which the problems of food supply feeding the people solving the 
housing problem a society without the institutions of a democratic 
government are absent can be called socialist 
if we want a more effective economy oriented toward technical 
progress if we want stores full of varied products of high 
quality if we want to be done with the shame of lines speculation 
and closed stores if we want to create a strong enough stimulus 
for labor we have no other choice but the transition to a market 
economy a lot hinders us in this including what i mentioned 
before dogma and myth 
there are general laws of social progress they cant be 
canceled any party or social organization that tries to hinder 
this process try to go against the logic of social progress will 
inevitably be pushed aside from the historical battle and meet 
defeat i think our congress has enough wisdom calm and confidence 
in the achievements of contemporary science to make the right 
decision

mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday gave himself and 
the soviet leadership two years to improve citizens lives or 
resign 
i think that in two years if there are no changes this 
leadership must go gorbachev told a tv interviewer as he entered 
the kremlin palace of congresses on the third day of the communist 
partys 28th congress 
it was the first time that the soviet president and party 
leader who is facing bitter criticism from both radical reformers 
and party traditionalists has given himself and the leadership a 
deadline for turning around the countrys political economic and 
social problems 
a western journalist who was on the scene said gorbachev had 
been asked what should happen if there are no improvements in the 
soviet union in two years 
speaking confidently in a videotaped segment shown on the 
nightly tv news program vremya he denied that the kremlin 
leadership would do anything to hold onto political power 
no he said i will tell you before perestroika we had 
more power i dont know who had more power than the general 
secretary of the central committee 
the leadership has made mistakes he said but he praised its 
courage in starting his reform program 
he did not specify who should be covered by his selfimposed 
deadline but it seemed likely that it was meant for both party and 
government leaders most important soviet officials still hold 
important posts in both the communist party and the soviet 
government 
earlier wednesday gorbachev heard more bitter criticism of his 
program inside the congress hall from regional party officials who 
accused the leadership of cowardice and indecision in an 
ideological battle against growing anticommunist sentiments 
underscoring the mood more than 4600 delegates to the 
communist partys 28th congress sat sullenly as deputy prime 
minister leonid a abalkin warned that resisting reform would lead 
the party to disaster 
our position today reminds of an army that is retreating in 
haste without a plan said nursultan nazarbaev party chief in 
the kazakhstan republic as he pleaded for clearer direction from 
the kremlin 
but despite the criticism speakers displayed no new ideas and 
no alternative to reelecting gorbachev 
the congress made a special appeal to one of most anticommunist 
elements of society disgruntled coal miners not to strike in a 
resolution it said that a repetition of last years walkout could 
lead to a breakup of the countrys economy 
regional leaders blamed their bosses in the kremlin for 
ecological disasters surrounding the chernobyl nuclear power plant 
central asias shrinking aral sea and its overdependence on cotton 
production and poor social and economic conditions that are 
causing an increasing number of soviets to blame the party as the 
source of their problems 
gorbachev listened quietly to the criticism which came mainly 
from party leaders of some of the 15 soviet republics large 
cities and ministers in charge of important sectors of the economy 
he heard much of the same criticism the previous day from fellow 
members of the partys ruling politburo but he appeared to remain 
in firm control of the congress 
the regional party leaders echoing a poll of delegates released 
by the state news agency tass demanded that the national 
leadership give them clearer direction 
they heaped criticism on party ideology chief vadim a medvedev 
who was jeered as he spoke on monday the first day of the congress 
nazarbaev the party chief in kazakhstan was warmly applauded 
when he complained that the partys opponents heap buckets of mud 
on lenin and leninsim and the cowardly activities of our 
ideologists led by medvedev demoralized our forces 
vitaly perov representing a region near moscow accused 
medvedev and gorbachev adviser alexander n yakovlev of hiding in 
the trenches while radicals from the democratic platform reform 
group seize the initiative 
anatoly poruchikov director of a central russian state farm

pratt amp whitney has recalled more than 
three dozen of its newest largest jet engines in response to a 
compressor problem that if left unchecked could have prompted an 
inflight engine shutdown 
the problem was discovered in one pw4000 engine compressor 
pratt spokesman mark sullivan said tuesday he said none of the 
recalled engines was in use by an airline 
the problem stemmed from a tightening of the bladetip clearance 
in the engines highpressure compressor a performance 
improvement pratt introduced in february sullivan said the 
reduced clearance meant rotating compressor blades were rubbing a 
bit harder against rub strips inside the engine casing 
although there were no problems in ground testing for the first 
38 improvedperformance engines the 39th engine had excessive rub 
causing the compressor to stall 
sullivan said east hartfordbased pratt amp whitney a division of 
hartfortbased united technologies corp is satisfied that the 
problem has been corrected he said the problem caused a very 
minimal disruption to our customers and their delivery schedules 
pratt has been marketing the pw4000 engine for the many jumbo 
jets expected to enter service in the 1990s the first 38 engines 
had been shipped to aircraft builders boeing co in seattle 
mcdonnell douglas corp in long beach calif and airbus industrie 
in toulouse france sullivan said 
to replace the recalled engines pratt delivered new pw4000s 
with the original bladetip clearance sullivan said

federal prosecutors hope testimony from five 
oklahoma and texas lawyers about the source of their legal fees 
will help in the drug conspiracy case against a dallas businessman 
the attorneys say the testimony comes under duress 
i just think its a shame tulsa lawyer john echols said 
tuesday its another example of what the war on drugs is doing 
to liberty in america 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver ruled monday 
the five must testify who paid their fees in the case that led to 
the 1987 federal drug conviction of four operators of a lab that 
made methamphetamine or speed 
youre going to wake up some day and wish you could talk to an 
attorney in confidence echols said it may be that in any one 
case it doesnt threaten liberty but if you transfer that to all 
cases it does 
stanley monroe the other tulsa attorney affected by the ruling 
called the courts decision a sad day for the us constitution 
of course im disappointed said monroe who declined to 
comment further until he was able to review the 33page ruling 
the court order caps months of legal maneuvers that at one point 
sent the attorneys to prison on a contempt citation for refusal to 
testify before a grand jury 
the appeals court stayed the contempt charge hours later and 
ordered the attorneys freed but mondays ruling upheld us 
district judge james o ellisons decision to jail the five in 
tulsa 
us attorney tony graham said tuesday he would not seek to have 
the attorneys jailed again 
i dont intend to be vindictive he said if i were i 
could ask they be put in jail now but i dont intend to let this 
case linger 
federal prosecutors contend dallas businessman james coltharp 
may have paid the attorneys fees graham said that information 
could be used to prove coltharp operated a continuing criminal 
enterprise 
coltharps federal trial on drug conspiracy and possession 
charges is scheduled to begin in august his indictment was 
unsealed march 7 in tulsa 
graham said if prosecutors were able to prove the attorneys 
fees came from illegal drug transactions then that money was the 
governments money from the moment the crook came in possession of 
it 
echols monroe and the other lawyers scott anderson james 
walker and tex mcconathy of dallas argued fee information is a 
privileged communication between attorney and client 
but the appeals court said there was no evidence that testifying 
to the grand jury would create a conflict between the attorneys and 
their clients that test is one of several used in such cases 
in its ruling the threejudge panel said the attorneys must 
tell the grand jury the source of their legal fees the amount of 
the fees and the names of anyone at least partly responsible for 
paying them 
the attorneys also must provide all documents related to paying 
or accepting those fees including checks deposit slips wire 
transfers and certain tax forms 
the court refused to order the attorneys to provide copies of 
any fee contracts and passed the issue to the district court for a 
decision

in their public statements delegates to the 
communist party congress are critical of many of mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms but in their hearts most seem to believe the 
party would be lost without him 
despite hardline attacks on gorbachevs policy of perestroika 
many delegates to the 28th congress of the soviet communist party 
say they expect to reelect him as party general secretary a post 
he has held since 1985 
five speakers from across the party spectrum endorsed gorbachev 
from the podium on wednesday prompting several delegates to pass 
notes forward asking for a ban on the practice 
mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev please appeal to the 
delegates not to praise you and make an icon of you because it 
creates the opposite reaction in the hall and the country said 
one request read by the acting chairman islam a karimov first 
secretary of the central asian republic of uzbekistan 
the party which seemed on the point of rupture in the weeks 
before the congress was gathering in gorbachevs banner for the 
time being 
members of the hardline majority who two weeks ago urged 
gorbachev to relinquish his party job and keep the national 
presidency had dropped that demand by the time the congress opened 
monday 
and members of the reformist democratic platform consisting of 
about 100 of the nearly 4700 delegates were faltering in their 
earlier decision to quit the party 
andrei godunov a democratic platform delegate from leningrad 
said it was better to work for change within the party and 
advocated a centrist and pragmatic course 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak a prominent reformer told 
reporters in the lobby of the palace of congresses that there 
must be a platform of consolidation at the party meeting 
he said he was leaning toward reelecting gorbachev although he 
opposed the idea of the same person heading both the party and the 
state 
at the other end of the political spectrum leningrad hardliner 
boris gidaspov delivered a surprisingly mild speech endorsing 
gorbachevs effort to shift power from the party to government 
bodies and elected legislatures 
gorbachevs leading hardline critic politburo member yegor k 
ligachev said on national television two weeks ago that gorbachev 
should not continue to be the national president and head of the 
communist party 
but on tuesday in a blistering critique of gorbachevs reforms 
ligachev carefully avoided a personal attack on him and did not 
repeat his demand to elect someone who could devote full time to 
party work 
kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov who followed ligachevs lead 
in attacking the reform movement nevertheless told reporters he 
would back gorbachev for general secretary 
a reformer from the ukraine newspaper editor vitaly g 
karpenko joined conservatives in criticizing gorbachev for 
combining the posts of president and party leader 
but he said if we have to vote i shall vote for gorbachev 
simply because there is no other alternative it is gorbachev 
who will be able to consolidate the country 
alexander frolov first secretary of the surovsky region near 
the central russian city of tula said we have no other leader 
with more potential than mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev 
pressed to explain the mixed attitude to gorbachev frolov fell 
back on an old russian proverb he who works is scolded

the government on wednesday 
temporarily suspended plans to kill 30000 seals in response to 
mounting criticism from local and foreign animal rights groups 
environment minister gert kotze acknowledged that public outrage 
was behind his decision to reconsider plans to kill 25000 cape fur 
seal cubs and 5000 adult male seals on the northwest coast later 
this month 
this is not backtracking at all but it is fair towards the 
public and conservationists to consider their objections and i 
want time to do that kotze told the staterun south african 
broadcasting corp 
the government has granted a fiveyear permit to kill seals to a 
taiwanese business group jiuh weh industries the company killed 
more than 3000 seals last year but the culling was not publicized 
and there were no protests 
the seal bodies would be used for pet food while the males 
genitals are prized as aphrodisiacs in the far east the government 
was to receive about 8 cents for each seal killed 
the earthlife africa group said it welcomed the ministers 
decision to temporarily suspend the culling 
but it added we would be far happier if there was a permanent 
suspension until then we are carrying on with the battle 
many countries have outlawed the killing of seals and animal 
rights groups say the practice should be banned in south africa 
because of its cruelty the seals are clubbed on the head then 
stabbed in the heart so they bleed to death 
south africa has permitted the commerical culling of seals for 
more than 70 years 
kotze said plans for the culling may proceed later 
the culling of wild animals is always unpleasant but 
unfortunately cannot always be avoided he told the south 
african broadcasting corp 
the department of environmental affairs had been defending its 
plans since local newspapers first reported the matter last week 
igniting the protests 
the department said the culling would not endanger the countrys 
huge 12 million cape fur seal population it said there was 
evidence the growing seal population had contributed to a decline 
in the number of jackass penguins and other sea animals as they 
competed for resources 
the seals could damage the south african fishing industry it 
said 
the seals must therefore be seen as competitors with the 
fishing industry and maintaining high population levels of seals 
could be costing this country both jobs and income the 
department said

a senior cuban economic official has 
defected through spain and now is under us protection in miami a 
spanish newspaper reported today 
the conservative daily abc quoted ramon gonzalez vergara as 
saying he could not endure to live in havana where there is no 
liberty 
a cubanamerican leader in miami said gonzalez vergara would be 
one of the highest civilian officials to defect from cuba since 
fidel castro took power in 1959 
there was no immediate us comment on the report 
gonzalez vergara 46 left madrid tuesday for miami under the 
care of us agents after first seeking political asylum in spain 
the newspaper said 
the paper said gonzalez vergara had been under police protection 
in spain since arriving june 25 by car from moscow with his wife 
two children and motherinlaw 
in an interview before he left for miami gonzalez vergara told 
the paper that president castro had named him to the post of deputy 
secretary of the council on mutual economic assistance or comecon 
earlier this year 
the moscowbased comecon coordinates economic policies of 
current and former communist nations including the soviet union 
eastern european countries cuba mongolia and vietnam 
gonzalez vergara told the paper he also had served as chief 
negotiator in moscow for soviet aid 
the newspaper quoted vergara as saying a new aid agreement with 
the soviet union is currently under discussion us officials 
estimate soviet aid to cuba is 43 billion a year but have 
speculated that kremlin budgetcutting and its ideological 
differences with the hardline havana government would lead to 
significant reductions 
gonzalez vergara appeared to confirm some of this speculation 
there will be aid on the part of the soviet union but it will 
be distinct from past amounts given the complicated economic 
situation in the ussr he was quoted as saying 
he characterized the cuban economy as in a continued process 
of decline i dont see in the short term any exit to the 
situation in cuba 
in miami roberto hernandez vice president of the anticastro 
cuban american national foundation said he had heard the defection 
report if true he said gonzalez vergara would be one of cubas 
higherranking civilian defectors 
we receive any defectors with open arms hernandez said 
as long as they behave and with dignity they will have our 
support 
the foundation which is planning for a cuba after castros 
rule anticipates many defectors in coming months because of 
deterioration in the cuban economy he said

two dozen wealthy nations on wednesday 
extended their aid program for poland and hungary to four other 
east european nations that shed their communist ways and switched 
to market economies 
agreement to grant financial and other aid to bulgaria 
czechoslovakia yugoslavia and east germany came at a meeting of 
foreign ministers of 24 nations including those of the european 
community the united states japan canada and australia 
romania was excluded because of doubts about its commitment to 
democratic reforms 
aid to the soviet union was discussed but no decision was taken 
west germany wants quick action on such aid the united states and 
japan among others do not 
secretary of state james a baker iii said he wants to see more 
reforms in the soviet union 
we take note of the fact that the soviet union is spending 
somewhere between 18 and 25 percent of its gross domestic product 
on military expenditures he told reporters 
baker said the united states has problems the soviet expenditure 
of between 9 billion and 15 billion a year to support regimes 
around the world that in the past at least have been hostile to the 
views and interests and principles of the united states 
the soviet union unlike the four countries added to the western 
aid program wednesday has not asked for western aid 
the 24 nations also disagreed over creating a special fund of 
possibly 10 billion to 12 billion as a financial safety net for 
east european nations 
frans andriessen the meeting chairman and ec external relations 
commissioner advanced the plan but the ministers said this was 
mostly a question for existing institutions such as the world bank 
and the international monetary fund 
wednesdays meeting fixed no specific aid figures 
these will emerge as each donor makes pledges in food money 
credits loan guarantees and other assistance 
it was a conference designed to take stock see whether we 
should and could decided to add countries to the aid package 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain told reporters 
aid to the new east european beneficiaries is bound to run into 
billions of dollars in the long term 
the 24 nations already have pledged more than 124 billion in 
aid to poland and hungary since they began coordinating their aid 
program last summer 
the aid effort is coordinated by the european communitys 
executive commission 
in a communique the ministers said the four additional 
beneficiaries of aid merited help in view of the reforms they have 
begun based on the rule of law the respect of human rights the 
introduction of multiparty systems the holding of free and fair 
elections and the establishment of market economies 
of romania where authorities relied on miners last month to 
suppress antigovernment protests they said 
recent events in romania have not created the conditions in 
which the implementation of coordinated assistance should be 
extended to that country under present circumstances 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany told 
reporters regarding aid to moscow we cannot expect the soviet 
union to resolve problems regarding the transition to a market 
economy on their own 
they urgently need help not only financial but in the form of 
advice it is in the common western interest to give this support 
officials from poland hungary and the four new beneficiary 
countries attended the meeting

germany will send a single team to the 1992 
olympics the presidents of the two national olympic committees 
announced wednesday 
it will be the first time since the 1964 olympic games in tokyo 
that germany will compete with a unified team and the merger is 
expected to make the already strong german teams a powerhouse 
single unit 
willi daume president of the west german olympic committee and 
joachim weiskopf president of the counterpart east german 
organization said the two national olympic committees will merge 
in december to oversee the formation of a single team 
the merger will follow the political unification of the two 
german states expected in early december 
a united german team may be competing in international athletics 
as early as march 1991 authorities in east berlin said 
the two olympic committee presidents said there was complete 
agreement between the two organisations about the decision 
we had no dissenting opinions whatsoever daum said at a 
news conference in east berlin 
the unification will be completed by the two olympic 
committees in an orderly fashion we will be working intensively 
together in the coming weeks daume said 
were moving ahead quickly for the sake of the athletes a 
fast merger is important in order to remove any uncertainty about 
who will make the team said weiskopf 
as the two germanys grow together there has been great concern 
over whether the athletes would feel shorted out of the competition 
for fewer places still we find great support among our sportsmen 
for forming one team from one country he said 
weiskopf said it was not yet clear how the team would be 
selected and funded he also said the international sport governing 
bodies would need to decide how a single german team would be 
represented in qualifying competitions for world and olympic events 
separate teams representing both the national olympic committees 
have already participated in qualifying events in some sports 
these events determine the rank and seeding for teams in major 
competitions such as the world championships in individual sports 
and the olympic games 
both olympic committee presidents also said they support the 
choice of berlin as site of the olympics in 2000 
the city of berlin should be accepted by the international 
olympic committee for athletic and humanitarian reasons said 
daume 
the groups with active participation by athletes will develop 
plans for the formation of a team for the 1992 olympic games in 
albertville france and barcelona spain 
east germany won 127 medals at the olympic games in 1988 and 
west germany won 48 together a united german team would have won 
175 14 medals more than firstplace soviet union 
in the tokyo games in 1964 the single german team competed 
under the olympic flag with the olympic anthem 
it is the place for sports to lead in this direction it is a 
great step towards peace weiskopf said

the interior ministry began a review 
wednesday of documents that purportedly show its secret police 
spied on prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis government as it took 
power from the communists 
the documents were presented by the conservative antisoviet 
political party confederation for an independent poland known by 
its polish initials kpn the papers are said to describe activity 
by the security services under interior minister czeslaw kiszczak 
who remained in the new government as a communist holdover 
dated from august and september 1989 mazowiecki was elected on 
aug 24 and the east blocs first noncommunist government was 
seated on sept 12 the reports analyze the activities of lech 
walesa potential splits in solidarity and debates by former 
communistlinked parties that joined the new coalition 
krzysztof krol a kpn leader on tuesday made public some of the 
documents he said were passed to him by an unidentified informer 
he said the originals were in his possession and would be handed 
over to the justice ministry 
spokesman wojciech garstka of the interior ministry went to kpn 
offices wednesday and took notes on the documents he expressed 
skepticism about their authenticity but reserved further comment 
krol said the papers prove that the security service under 
gen kiszczak at least with the knowledge of president jaruzelski 
spied on the government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
kiszczak was one of four communists who remained in mazowieckis 
government wojciech jaruzelski the former communist party first 
secretary who imposed martial law in 1981 was given the presidency 
in july largely to smooth relations with the soviet union 
the transitional concessions to the communists resulted from 
historic negotiations that ended the partys 45year grip on power 
at the time poland was the only country that had gone so far 
but as reform swept eastern europe the continued presence of 
former communists in the government became a source of controversy 
walesa leader of the solidarity union and many poles have 
agitated for their removal 
the documents are addressed to jaruzelski kiszczak and a senior 
interior ministry deputy according to the gazeta wyborcza daily 
mazowiecki will go before parliament friday to unveil a shakeup 
in his government struggling to surmount an avalanche of criticism 
from farmers and walesa 
this was disclosed wednesday by solidarity parliamentary leader 
bronislaw geremek at a meeting of his caucus 
government spokesmen declined information on what changes were 
under consideration 
the shock economic reform program embarked on by mazowiecki and 
his deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz has prompted harsh 
protests from various hardhit sectors 
among those protesting the loudest are polands 25 million 
private farmers roman bartoszcze leader of the polish peasant 
party which competes with other groups to represent rural 
interests suggested tuesday that his partys four ministers quit 
the government 
walesa wants mazowiecki to replace holdover communists in the 
government hold early parliamentary and presidential elections and 
speed privatization of state enterprises 
the government also is grappling with a major rail strike 
walesa is widely believed to be gearing up to run for president 
to replace jaruzelski

prime minister margaret thatcher and nelson 
mandela agreed they can do business together even though their 
first meeting wednesday failed to resolve differences over 
sanctions and the use of violence 
mrs thatcher welcomed the black south african leader just 
three years after she denounced his african national congress as a 
terrorist organization and said she would have nothing to do with 
it 
they had a very good exchange they agreed to keep in touch 
said a spokesman for mrs thatcher who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules the objective of establishing a personal 
relationship and rapport was fully achieved 
mandela in an unusual description of the british leader whose 
toughness has earned her the reputation of the iron lady 
called mrs thatcher warm and gentle 
the ancs deputy president said he came away full of hope and 
strength from their threehour meeting at the prime ministers 
residence at no 10 downing street 
picking up on mrs thatchers wellknown phrase that she could 
do business with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev a reporter 
asked mandela if he felt he could do business with her 
oh yes im doing business with her now he replied we 
made progress we will keep in close contact 
unlike the other leaders on mandelas world tour mrs thatcher 
openly opposes sanctions and wants those imposed by the european 
community relaxed as a reward for south african president fw de 
klerks reform program 
like president bush mrs thatcher also wants the anc to 
renounce its armed struggle against the white minority government 
mandela has insisted that the sanctions remain in place for now 
to keep pressure on the south african government to dismantle the 
apartheid system he also has said the anc cannot renounce the 
armed struggle until blacks are guaranteed their political rights 
mandela had earlier expressed hope that his meeting with mrs 
thatcher would narrow their differences on these two issues but in 
the end they apparently agreed to disagree without debating the 
issues extensively 
asked about the ancs armed struggle mandela said we dont 
believe in force as a means of solving problems if we resorted to 
force its because we had no other option except to use force to 
defend our people 
mandela said the anc is now mobilizing the country around 
peace but could not rule out resorting to violence if existing 
conditions in south africa do not change 
mrs thatchers spokesman said the prime minister and mandela 
agreed on the main issue of getting rid of apartheid and focused on 
the broader issue of the way ahead including the changes in 
apartheid laws the economy and the importance of flexibility 
before the midday meeting 300 antiapartheid demonstrators 
rallied at the end of downing street and chanted as mandelas 
limousine went through the gates blocking off the street 
mandelas twoday visit to britain ended the european and north 
american legs of his 14nation world tour before flying to zambia 
he said his meetings had surpassed expectations 
our message for the maintenance of sanctions has succeeded 
beyond our wildest dreams he said our appeal for resources 
has been equally successful in some respects again beyond our 
expectations 
at his wednesday morning meeting with leaders of the 
confederation of british industry mandela said he viewed 
nationalization as the method for redistributing south africas 
wealth to reduce the disparity in living standards between blacks 
and whites but he added he was open to other options

on the availability of rail cars said gintaras yatkonis of the 
lithuanian council of ministers information center

parliament agreed to freeze its march 11 declaration of 
independence its lawmakers agreed to the 100day freeze so that 
negotiations on independence with moscow can begin the freeze will 
start once talks begin 
yatkonis said a telegram from the soviet transport ministry 
addressed to prime minister kazimiera prunskiene arrived late 
tuesday advising that the ban on railroad deliveries had been 
lifted 
the ban was imposed to prevent lithuanians from making private 
arrangements to receive sugar coffee fish tea and citrus fruit 
from other parts of the soviet union and abroad 
yatkonis said the council of ministers has ordered that cargo be 
unloaded as quickly as possible so that the trains can return for 
new loads 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev cut off all shipments of 
oil most supplies of natural gas and other key items to lithuania 
on april 18 after the republic refused to rescind its 
proindependence laws lithuanias 38 million residents depend on 
the soviet union for their energy supplies 
about 50000 of lithuanias estimated 11 million workers lost 
their jobs because of the shortages

what happened in lithuania including the party split could 
easily happen elsewhere 
whos next he asked wondering aloud if this would be the 
last national communist party congress 
we cant allow adventurists and neostalinists to lord it over 
people he said referring to lithuanian election victories by 
the proindependence grassroots movement sajudis he also partly 
blamed the party leadership in moscow for allowing the situation in 
lithuania to get out of hand 
lithuania estonia and latvia were forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 after being independent since world war i

the germanys took another step toward full 
unification wednesday when east germanys cabinet voted to set dec 
2 as the date for elections to an allgerman parliament 
government spokesman matthias gehler made the announcement late 
wednesday afternoon at a news conference in east berlin 
the east german parliament is expected to approve the date and 
west germanys governing coalition has also said it was prepared 
for allgerman elections on dec 2 
the announcement came as east german workers concerned that 
unification would lead to high unemployment held a series of 
warning strikes and west germanys economics minister cautioned 
labor unions against unreasonable demands 
an unspecified number of workers held strikes at at least four 
metalwork plants in northern east germany the staterun adn news 
agency reported 
government sources in east berlin said prime minister lothar de 
maiziere will insist on separate elections in east germany and west 
germany 
that coincides with west german proposals to have german 
elections on the same day but separate balloting in the east and 
west 
the issue has become important because under west german law 
parties must receive 5 percent of the vote to have representation 
in parliament 
there is no such cutoff in east germany and parties fear their 
chances would be reduced if they had to compete throughout east 
germany and west germany 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said if the 5 
percent rule applied but east germany and west germany held 
separate elections a party in west germany would need 2 million 
votes for representation while an east german party would need only 
575000 votes 
there are about 40 million eligible voters in west germany and 
approximately 12 million eligible voters in east germany 
he said separate elections would most likely be held and 
immediately after the polls closed east germany would declare 
itself unified with west germany under the west german constitution 
schaeuble in a wednesday interview with deutschlandfunk radio 
said any other arrangement would mean east german parties that have 
merged with their west german counterparts would not have a fair 
chance at gaining seats in an allgerman parliament 
on friday schaeuble and east german parliament state secretary 
guenther krause are scheduled to begin talks in east berlin on a 
second state treaty on the constitutional and legal aspects of 
unification 
the two countries merged their economies and social systems on 
sunday in the first major step toward unification 
about 30000 workers held brief warning strikes monday the 
first day east germany went to work under a capitalistic system 
after 40 years of rigid socialism 
experts have predicted up to onethird of east germanys 8000 
businesses could fold and as many as half its 8 million workers 
could lose their jobs under pressure from west germany competition 
east germanys industrial base is antiquated and 
laborintensive foreign capital has been slow in arriving

teacher unionists from czechoslovakia and south 
africa greeted us teachers on the fourth of july with a plea for 
help in planting the seeds of democratic education in their 
countries 
czechoslovakia is an atomized society whose traditional social 
ties are destroyed a society believing in no values a society 
that does not trust its teachers politicians or priests said 
jan urban a former philosophy teacher driven from his post in 1977 
for human rights activities but eventually rising to a leadership 
role in czechoslovakias revolution 
addressing the american federation of teachers annual convention 
being held here this week urban added we need education for 
democracy 
we have to face the hardships of a market economy that we know 
nothing of what we need most is teacher training urban later 
told reporters 
several hours of the aft general session wednesday was dedicated 
to the spread of freedom in eastern europe and elsewhere in the 
last several years the union detailed its activities in those 
nations in helping budding teacher unions and lending technical 
assistance to educators 
curtis nkondo a south african union leader and former teacher 
repeatedly jailed for antiapartheid activities raised a clenched 
right fist and told 3200 cheering aft delegates education in 
our country is so that blacks should remain hewers of wood and 
carriers of water forever 
some 60 foreign teacher delegates attended the aft convention 
marking the 744000member unions 75th anniversary 
at a separate workshop on the afts international activities on 
tuesday representatives from half a dozen east bloc countries 
called on us educators to come to their classrooms and help them 
understand and teach democratic values 
they also asked delegates to send any old texts printing 
machines or other supplies they could spare 
we all have nothing everything you can send will be used 
said jaroslav kalous chairman of the school committee of civic 
forum one of the groups instrumental in bringing about free 
elections in czechoslovakia last year 
the challenge educators in czechoslovakia and other fledgling 
democracies face in rebuilding trust in schools and other social 
institutions is as daunting as the revolutions themselves urban 
said 
teachers once the pride of my country assumed the role of 
pitiful if not hated servants of a hated ideology which was 
incorporated into any subject they taught he said 
before last year much of the education in those countries was 
controlled politically through the communist states educators now 
find themselves with the daunting task of transforming those 
schools the curricula the way democracy is taught said eric 
chenoweth an official of afts education for 
democracyinternational project which has been sending technical 
aid to those schools 
aft president albert shanker said in an interview earlier this 
week i think the whole celebration of the end of the cold war is 
especially important to the aft a lot of educational organizations 
over the years took the view that well democracy is just one form 
of government and we would be ethnocentric to tout our system as 
the best we did not take that view 
but it is not the intention of our union to go over there and 
say this is the american model and thats it no ifs or buts 
insisted chenoweth 
the aft has already helped support free teacher unions in poland 
and hungary 
it is developing special texts and curricula explaining the 
concept of democracy one is now being written by diane ravitch an 
educational historian at columbia teachers college 
the union also is trying to get its members to arrange 
classroomtoclassroom and schooltoschool exchanges so that 
eastern europeans can learn us educational concepts and american 
kids can learn about the political upheavals in those countries 
such classroomtoclassroom projects already have led to letter 
exchanges between students in poland and anchorage alaska mclean 
va and albuquerque nm aft officials said 
many teachers in formerly communist countries have grown to 
mistrust unions said zoltan pokorni of the new hungarian 
democratic teachers union 
we need to learn how to get new members how to organize 
collective bargaining how to set up a democratic union 
structure he said 
pokorni added however that east bloc nations have no desire to 
simply copy us labor and education customs with no regard to 
their countries histories and traditions

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said 
wednesday iran and iraq have moved closer to peace following direct 
talks between their foreign ministers aimed at a formal ending to 
almost 10 years of hostilities 
speaking in an interview with the official islamic republic news 
agency and staterun tehran radio rafsanjani said what is clear 
to me is that we are now closer to peace compared to two months 
ago 
the confidence of the two countries in the fact that the other 
side desires peace has become relatively greater rafsanjani 
added without elaboration 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar mediated the 
tuesday meeting in geneva between the foreign ministers of iran and 
iraq ali akbar velayati and tariq aziz 
it was the first facetoface encounter between velayati and 
aziz since peace negotiations were launched in august 1988 a few 
days after a unmediated ceasefire halted the eightyear persian 
gulf war 
although velayati and aziz were present in the four rounds of 
peace talks held since 1988 the two men did not speak directly to 
each other instead relaying their comments through perez de 
cuellar 
the earlier negotiations stalled almost immediately over the 
question of priorities iran insisted on an iraqi withdrawal from 
territories occupied in the last weeks of the war 
iraq insisted that iran agree first to the dredging of the 
shattalarab waterway of war debris the waterway marks the 
southern border of the two nations 
the common border ran down the middle of the channel before the 
war but iraq has demanded full sovereignty over the shattalarab 
its main outlet to the gulf 
before leaving geneva wednesday velayati told reporters he was 
optimstic that the talks would move ahead 
during the meeting we found out that iraq and iran both of 
them now are more flexible than in the past he said without 
elaborating 
perez de cuellar who in previous talks relayed statements 
between the two ministers said tuesdays meeting was a 
psychological breakthrough though nothing substantive was 
discussed

in bold daytime operations thieves cut two 
paintings from their frames at two paris museums on wednesday one 
a renoir stolen from the louvre officials said 
both paintings renoirs portrait of a seated woman and 
heberts portrait of monaluccia were small format paintings 
such paintings are often chosen by thieves because they can be 
easily concealed 
the theft of the renoir which had been hanging in the louvres 
thirdfloor pavillon de flore gallery was discovered about 215 
pm officials said the hebert was discovered missing from the 
ernest hebert museum across the seine river on the left bank 
about an hour later officials said both paintings were stolen 
during the day presumably after the museums had opened 
officials noted that in both cases the paintings had been cut 
from their frames but could not immediately say whether the thefts 
were related 
both museums are run by the directory of french museums a 
government agency 
portrait of a seated woman painted between 19161918 
measures 135 by 105 inches heberts work painted around 1870 
measures 14 by 12 inches 
a catalogue of stolen paintings recently published by the 
interior ministry shows that small format paintings are the most 
common targets 
the catalogue also shows that 58 percent of the paintings stolen 
from french museums between 1979 and 1989 were taken from the 
stocks about 40 percent of the stolen paintings had been on 
display 
the last paris museum theft that occurred during the day was 
oct 27 1985 when a gang of armed thieves held up the marmottan 
museum stealing a number of impressionist works including claude 
monets impression sunrise which inspired the name for the 
impressionist movement 
the painting has not been recovered

albanian authorities agreed to meet 
wednesday with a representative of foreign embassies sheltering 
more than 200 asylumseekers who have issued one of the biggest 
rebuffs to 45 years of orthodox communist rule 
in vienna an albanian diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
that all foreign embassies in tirana the albaninan capital were 
assured anyone wishing to leave would receive a passport he 
indicated there would be no reprisals 
last week a few albanians hoping to leave their impoverished 
isolated country of 32 million sought political asylum at 
embassies word of their success apparently spread by word of 
mouth and on monday their numbers swelled truckloads crashed 
through embassy gates or clambered over walls 
some albanians were injured in their desperate attempt to gain 
entry at least three were shot and wounded by agents of the feared 
secret police diplomats said on condition of anonymity 
in bonn a foreign ministry spokesman said the west german 
embassy in tirana had received reports that the albanian guards 
carried away bodies which didnt move we dont know if they were 
dead or not the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the reports which came from people who said they witnessed 
the scene could not be confirmed by the embassy 
the albanian government led by ramiz alia also said people 
were wounded but gave no figures it described the asylumseekers 
as either criminals or deluded adolescents in a dispatch from ata 
the albanian state agency 
tanjug the official yugoslav news agency said 214 albanians 
who want to leave the country have taken refuge in about a dozen 
foreign diplomatic missions in tirana 
in a telephone interview wednesday with the associated press in 
ankara the turkish ambassador in tirana teoman surenkok gave the 
total number of refugeseekers as 243 
the unrest is the latest sign that the people are frustrated by 
albanias refusal to follow other eastern european countries in 
adopting democratic reforms 
albanian officials arranged to meet with yugoslav ambassador 
novak pribicevic who was empowered to represent all foreign 
missions harboring albanians according to austrias apa news 
agency 
in addition tanjug cited unidentified albanian sources as 
saying the communist party central committee planned an emergency 
meeting shortly 
foreign ambassadors accredited to tirana agreed to jointly seek 
a solution to the plight of albanians in their embassies 
hanns schumacher a foreign ministry spokesman in bonn said 
albanian authorities refused on wednesday to grant landing 
permission for a cargo plane carrying relief goods for the west 
german embassy where 86 albanians sought refuge he said bonn 
would pursue the matter thursday 
in warsaw a foreign ministry official said 41 albanians sought 
refuge in the polish embassy andrzej barzyk said poland under no 
circumstances would hand the refugees back to albanian 
authorities if there are no guarantees their rights are to be 
respected 
other embassies echoed those sentiments 
cuba reportedly ejected some albanians and in an apparent 
protest a bomb was thrown at the cuban embassy late tuesday 
causing damage but no injuries 
the hungarian foreign ministry said albanian authorities pledged 
to issue passports to the four men holed up in budapests embassy 
but a ministry spokesman said the four refused to leave the embassy 
the east german news agency adn said similar guarantees had been 
given to other embassies where albanians sought refuge 
most of the 30 albanians in tiranas turkish embassy left the 
mission after being promised exit papers diplomats said 
the albanian refugee flight recalled a similar situation last 
year when east germans seeking safe passage to the west filled 
embassies in other east european states the move helped fuel the 
peaceful revolution that toppled communist rule in east germany 
the situation in albania indicated authorities may have done too 
little too late to ease restrictions 
under reforms begun in may starting tuesday albanians who 
previously were not allowed to travel freely are entitled to 
passports a ban on religion has been lifted as has the death 
penalty for defectors and modest economic retooling has been 
promised 
the country has also expressed interest in broadening ties with 
other nations 
but the communist monopoly on power continues the leadership 
has firmly rejected the political plurality now practiced in all 
former soviet satellite nations 
foreign governments have protested that shots were fired at 
their missions doorsteps and european community officials 
discussed the albanian situation in brussels belgium 
italys foreign minister asked the united nations to act on what 
he said was albanias violations of international law and human 
rights 
bulgaria expressed astonishment over the arrest of one 
wouldbe asylum seeker within its embassy compound 
west germany protested the brutal behavior of albanian 
guards who fired on people trying to enter the embassies 
turkeys surenkok said large crowds gathered briefly outside the 
embassy to applaud asylumseekers he said asylumseekers 
complained about lack of political freedom and the rigid economy

mayor art agnos has ordered police to break 
up a sprawling encampment of homeless people just outside city 
hall substituting a resettlement program critics call insufficient 
agnos order which takes effect friday directs police to begin 
enforcing laws against sleeping in public places 
the mayor an unabashed liberal democrat tolerated the 
encampment of as many as 350 people for two years because he said 
there was no workable alternative 
this week the city took over operation of two shelters intended 
to provide comprehensive services such as alcohol detoxification 
and job counseling to the homeless city officials say the plan is 
a new approach of offering a port of reentry to society 
advocates for the homeless charge that the two service shelters 
are insufficient and understaffed and wont solve the citys 
housing problem they say the agnos program will reshuffle the 
homeless by forcing out 215 people staying in a private shelter 
taken over by the city 
they said the new policy will break up couples and force many 
people into jails doorways or alleys 
whats going to happen friday night is san francisco will 
start criminalizing homelessness said josh brandon of the 
coalition on homelessness 
the city tells you there are 329 beds in our new system 
what they neglect to tell you is 215 are already full brandon 
said 
only men will receive beds in the new multiservice shelters 
during the first few weeks of the program women will continue to 
be placed in existing housing programs until beds are added to the 
new shelters by mid to late summer 
some women say they shun the existing programs because they 
involve placement in seedy unsafe hotels or have too many 
restrictions 
cristina jaskula who has been living outside city hall since 
february says she and her husband would rather remain free 
than be separated in order to have shelter 
a shelter is like being in prison said jaskula 42 
theres no freedom of movement 
in the past two years the number of homeless people in the 
treeshaded civic center park has grown into the hundreds it has 
been dubbed camp agnos by some of its residents and critics 
including city employees who used to have lunch in the park but 
have been driven away by the shabbiness and human waste 
most campers have packed up their tents blankets and other 
belongings since the eviction order which told them to report to 
an intake office on polk street prior to the holiday wednesday 82 
people had reported and 64 men were sent to a new shelter nine 
blocks from the civic center 
one shelter which opened monday night accommodates 110 men and 
will add 90 beds for women by august officials said 
the 215 men at the shelter the city took over will be 
transitioned out to make way for new occupants including 
women said judy schutzman the citys codirector of the centers 
ten beds are to be added next month she said 
city officials say the transition means finding housing for the 
men advocates for the homeless are doubtful 
food not bombs a group that feeds the homeless plans to stage 
an allnight protest outside agnos home friday night bringing 
homeless people to the mayors doorstep

romania and bulgaria on wednesday 
moved to resolve an ecological dispute that has long soured 
relations between them 
prime ministers petre roman of romania and andrei lukanov of 
bulgaria agreed at a meeting to set up a joint commission that will 
work toward diminishing and stopping the pollution caused by the 
giurgiu chemical plant and the bulgarian nuclear facility near the 
border 
the two sides undertook to provide each other with exact data on 
the disputed facilities within 20 days and to complete a convention 
for protecting the environment along their border before august 
they said world experts will be asked to assess the degree of 
pollution at the frontier and the measures necessary for removing 
the pollution 
the agreement was announced in a communique released after the 
meeting 
thousands of bulgarians demonstrated along the frontier last 
month demanding closure of the giurgiu plant 
romanians in turn accused the bulgarians of having insufficient 
safety standards at their nearby nuclear plant 
about 500 bulgarians kept up a protest on their side of the 
border for the third day wednesday and at 6 pm blocked 
romaniabound traffic for two hours 
romanias house of deputies meanwhile approved romans liberal 
program of radical reform on wednesday with only 12 of its 296 
members opposed 
president ion iliescu approved the program tuesday 
in a televised fourth of july address us ambassador alan 
green jr warned the romanian government that expressions of 
adherence to democratic ideas are not enough 
democracy is not established by rhetoric or good intentions 
alone these must be accompanied by concrete steps to secure the 
conrnerstones of freedom a democratic government encourages 
peaceful dissent it guarantees freedom of expression 
washington has criticized last months government action in 
suppressing a 53day opposition rally in central bucharest 
especially the use of miners from outside bucharest to track down 
and beat opposition students and intellectuals

japans nec corp on wednesday unveiling what it 
called the worlds fastest generalpurpose computer saying it has 
moved ahead of its us and japanese rivals 
the company said its new acos system 3800 computers were 
designed for maximum speed and memoryprocessing capacity 
the top of the line the model 60 is capable of speeds of up to 
500 million instructions per second and can store up to 128 
trillion bits of data the equivalent of about 200000 years of a 
typical englishlanguage newspaper nec said 
last month japans hitachi ltd announced its m880 series of 
mainframe computers with a maximum speed of 155 million 
instructions per second which it said was then the fastest in the 
world ibms top model has a speed of 122 million instructions per 
second it said 
the hitachi computers are compatible with ibm machines while 
necs mainframes are not making direct comparisons difficult 
but the new nec computers appeared to put the company 
significantly ahead of its rivals in the competition for top speed 
ibm the worlds largest maker of computers is reportedly 
developing a new mainframe computer expected to debut next year 
generalpurpose mainframe computers are intended for varied 
office and business use while supercomputers are designed 
specifically for scientific calculations and therefore can operate 
more rapidly 
necs executive vice president yukio mizuno said the system 
3800 computers are designed to handle large data bases for one or 
more companies 
up until now large mainframes generally served a single 
company but increasingly they are being used to create networks 
between several companies such as a manufacturer and its 
wholesalers he said 
seven versions of the computers are available ranging from one 
to six processors the company said a processor is the brain 
of a computer and several processors give a machine an ability to 
process information more rapidly 
monthly lease fees range from 330000 to 19 million nec 
said it said it plans to sell about 200 systems over the next five 
years

tourism minister olivier stirn resigned wednesday 
following criticism over a political meeting he organized in which 
people were paid to fill up a roomful of empty seats 
the office of socialist premier michel rocard announced the 
resignation in the late evening just hours after stirn told french 
tv news that he would not step down 
the brief statement said stirn was resigning at his own request 
and that minister for foreign trade jeanmarie rausch would take 
over the tourism duties 
stirn in his own statement later said he was a victim of the 
political game and media pressure he attributed the incident 
to a small error by an entourage without bad intentions 
i am and remain a faithful servant of the state he said 
the french media disclosed tuesday night at the end of a 
twoday symposium addressed by several government ministers that 
several hundred people had been hired to fill up an empty house 
stirn who sponsored the symposium entitled headquarters for 
progress admitted that was the case but said the hiring was done 
without his knowledge by overzealous party members 
about 50 unemployed were paid he said i think it is 
regrettable but we should not get dramatic about it 
numerous government ministers and opposition members said stirn 
should resign to avoid disgracing all politicians some called the 
incident scandalous and revolting 
the symposium opened monday morning to a roomful of 37 people 
including participants journalists and photographers by 
afternoon only about 20 people were present according to press 
reports a situation repeated tuesday morning 
but by midafternoon however the house was suddenly full 
people applauded vigorously during speeches by socialist party 
first secretary pierre mauroy former premier laurent fabius and 
others 
but the house emptied when defense minister jeanpierre 
chevenement rose to speak reporters at the symposium said it was 
subsequently revealed that the audiences threehour contract 
expired at 615 pm just as the defense minister began his speech 
stirn later conceded that two party members embarrassed by the 
lack of attendance had contracted without his knowledge with two 
agencies which furnish people for crowd events 
the incident was disclosed accidentally after a cameraman was 
approached by a person leaving the meeting asking for his envelope 
of 300 francs or 55 french tv reported

a nasa rocket scientist and 
alleged nazi war criminal who wants to return to the united states 
joined a congressman at a news conference wednesday just a 
halfmile over the us border 
rep james traficant dohio said arthur rudolph who played a 
major role in designing and building the rocket that took americans 
to the moon passed a liedetector test in which he denied any 
involvement in nazi war crimes 
traficant said rudolph who voluntarily left the united states 
in 1984 in a deal with the us government deserves a hearing on 
his request to return 
arthur rudolph without question answered truthfully to all of 
these questions traficant told the news conference in a hotel 
had dr rudolph failed i would not be here today 
the justice departments office of special investigations which 
has investigated alleged nazi war criminals living in the united 
states has run roughshod over this particular fellow 
traficant said 
if all of their cases once analyzed look like this case and 
some others that are into focus then there should be an 
investigation into the office of special investigations 
traficant has also defended john demjanjuk a retired cleveland 
auto worker on death row in israel who was convicted of nazi 
atrocities the congressman has sharply criticized the osi for 
trying to discredit some witnesses in the demjanjuk case 
the osi accused rudolph of working thousands of slave laborers 
to death building nazi v2 missiles during world war ii 
after the war the us army brought into this country rudolph 
and more than 100 other members of the wernher von braun rocket 
team rudolph became chief coordinator for the saturn v rocket 
supervising its planning design testing and production for the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
but in 1984 facing what the osi said was evidence of his 
involvement in war crimes rudolph voluntarily renounced the us 
citizenship he had been granted admitted his complicity in war 
crimes and left the country in a deal that let him keep his nasa 
pension 
now 84 rudolph sat beside traficant as the congressman said the 
scientist was coerced into the agreement and wants to return to the 
united states because he does not want to be remembered as a war 
criminal 
dr rudolph has decided that history and how theyll record 
his name may be more important than the hassles which hell 
undertake traficant said 
rudolph blinking under camera flashes and television lights 
refused to address the media saying ive been advised by my 
attorney not to answer any questions 
rudolph has signed a document authorizing the osi to turn over 
any evidence of his involvement in war crimes to traficant the 
congressman said 
under the waiver of the privacy act i will expect to be 
receiving from osi all of its socalled sealed evidence 
traficant said 
osi head neal m sher said in 1984 that rudolph while chief 
operations director for german v2 missile production participated 
in the persecution of forced laborers of whom as many as 20000 
are estimated to have died 
sher has described rudolph who said he belonged to the nazi 
party as a selfconfessed war criminal but traficant claims an 
army investigation absolved rudolph of war crimes in 1947 
on tuesday justice department spokesman doug tillett said the 
department still considers valid the agreement rudolph signed in 
1984 
but rudolph claims that not only did he not persecute any 
laborers he was an advocate for those suffering 
after leaving the united states rudolph went to west germany 
where a government attempt to prosecute him for war crimes failed 
to turn up enough evidence 
rudolph arrived in canada on sunday and faces an immigration 
hearing in toronto on friday to determine if he can stay 
asked about reports rudolph might try to enter the united states 
illegally traficant said rudolph is not going to be breaking any 
laws

the government is looking for a few good men 
and women to help clean up radioactive contamination at its nuclear 
weapons plants over the next 30 years 
the job is challenging with plenty of time outdoors and 
officials guarantee a career for just about any college science 
student 
the department of energy said it will take 50 percent more money 
and twice as many people as previously estimated to carry out a 
fiveyear cleanup plan at the waste sites 
weve got to convince the people in the colleges to go and 
look at this as the career of the future its an exciting 
career an interesting career one that is involved with new 
technology said leo duffy head of does cleanup office 
he said there are at least 20000 job openings over the next 30 
years in the field and an annual budget in billions of dollars 
he said the department intends to do a better job of publicizing 
the benefits of working as an environmental scientist seeking 
better ways to contain and dispose of radioactive waste 
environmentally they are going to be out there in the wide 
open spaces of the west the sage brush the rabbits and the elk 
and the antelope he said 
in a typical day he said a scientist would go to work in the 
morning in a jeep pulling a boat go fishing for awhile picking 
up samples of fish trapping some animals and taking them back to 
the laboratory 
as the department tries to lure workers into the field duffy 
said it will face the same image problems it faces every day 
technology does not always interest every man and woman he 
said distrust in department of energy past practices is a 
problem the fact youve got radioactivity is a major problem 
duffy said the lack of scientists and adequate technology are 
the biggest hurdles to cleaning up weapons plants that have dumped 
highlevel radioactivity into the soil and water 
weve got a problem he said we have a major program 
initiated for fiscal year 1990 of approximately 26 billion and 
we dont have the capabilityto support it 
the government now estimates cleanup costs for 19911995 will be 
286 billion nearly 50 percent more than the 195 billion 
projected last fall 
the general accounting office predicts costs will total 150 
billion to 200 billion over the life of the 30year project 
the worst thing we can do is go out and throw money at this 
program and wind up with a scandal in three years that will damage 
both the departments credibility and the ability to clean up our 
sites duffy said 
in addition to recruiting and training workers duffy said the 
doe has to do a better job of persuading private entrepreneurs to 
get into the business 
the department said the fear of being sued is deterring 
businesses from getting involved in the cleanup 
anybody who makes a mistake in those kind of areas is betting 
on their company duffy said when we are talking about the 
kind of money to clean up an individual site anywhere from 1 
billion to 25 billion there are not too many companies in the 
united states that are willing to bet their assets on that

teachers must face facts on how badly us schools 
are performing and work harder to persuade administrators to 
embrace reform teacher union leader albert shanker said wednesday 
most of our members dont believe this it isnt my school 
thats bad its that big city down the road shanker said in his 
keynote address at the american federation of teachers annual 
convention 
we ought to look at the facts he said we shouldnt be 
the ones making believe that nothings wrong 
he cited statistics showing that 95 percent of japanese high 
school graduates do math as well as the top 5 percent of us 
students 
and he urged teachers to get the reform ball rolling by helping 
create at least one school per district that looks genuinely 
different from those operating today 
lets have schools in which teachers do very little talking 
where kids are doing the work where they can do it over different 
periods of time where they can work either privately or in groups 
and lets put as much technology in schools as we can shanker 
said 
too often schools have tried one of these reform ideas but not 
most or all of them shanker said 
while exhorting the 3200 teacher delegates to go back home and 
level with the public about how serious the education crisis is 
shanker renewed his attacks on school administrators for failing to 
respond to union reform initiatives 
im very disappointed because were out there alone i dont 
sense very much enthusiasm on the part of management he said in 
an hourlong address 
the 744000member afts fourday annual gathering concludes 
thursday the 2 millionmember national education association will 
hold its annual convention thursday through sunday 
among the days other events aft delegates approved a union 
boycott of the japanese automakers nissan honda and isuzu for 
allegedly resisting unionization in its us plants 
and shanker 61 was elected unopposed to a ninth twoyear term 
as aft president 
union favorite sen edward m kennedy dmass also addressed 
aft delegates and won frequent applause for blasts at president 
bush for failing to fund education reforms 
if the administration has its way and we keep on 
shortchanging reform the next generation of students wont even 
be able to read their presidents lips he said

capitol records promised to provide legal 
help to store operators threatened with arrest for selling its 
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit 
lyrics 
the music industry has proven its willingness to address the 
issue of explicit material through our use of voluntary uniform 
stickers capitol president hale milgrim said in a statement 
released tuesday 
however it is becoming evident that other forces see 
stickering as an excuse to censor artists milgrim said this 
is intolerable and a violation of the first amendment 
milgrim said some retailers are afraid to order recordings with 
the stickers to allay those fears capitol will provide lawyers 
for anyone threatened with harassment or arrest for selling its 
labeled recordings he said 
capitol said it will serve notice of that promise with a label 
of a different kind retailers capitol records vehemently 
opposes censorship of artistic expression and will assist in the 
defense of any attempt to stop the legitimate sale of this 
lpcdcassette 
we feel that an artist has the right to express his or her 
distinctive viewpoints through music and that retailers should be 
able to make this music available to the public without the fear of 
being arrested or harassed milgrim said 
the first capitol records carrying the voluntary industry label 
and the retailer notification label will be released in august 
they are releases by cpo and king tee as well as the return of

a bomb damaged the offices of 
an antiapartheid newspaper wednesday a day after rightwing 
extremists claimed responsibility for recent attacks against whites 
wanting to end segregation 
the predawn explosion at the empty offices of the 
afrikaanslanguage newspaper vrye weekblad was the fifth attack in 
as many nights against whites opposed to apartheid 
the bomb caused only minor damage no one has been hurt in any 
of the explosions all in johannesburg 
a man claiming to belong to a rightwing extremist group the 
white wolves said his organization was responsible for the recent 
blasts he made the claim in a phone call tuesday to the citizen a 
progovernment newspaper 
the editor of vrye weekblad max du preez said an unidentified 
caller phoned him at home wednesday morning and warned that the 
attack was only a beginning 
the attacks on the four preceding nights were at the office and 
the home of one antiapartheid city council member at the home of 
another city council member and at a synagogue 
the synagogue was covered with graffiti comparing jews to the 
african national congress the countrys leading black opposition 
group a number of jews are active in antiapartheid groups 
the caller to the citizen newspaper said all the places attacked 
were considered part of the same target 
the johannesburg city council said security had been tightened 
at the homes of all 51 council members the council is controlled 
by the antiapartheid democratic party 
the white wolves have claimed responsibilty for several attacks 
in the past two years police say they have not been able to 
determine if such an organization actually exists or if white 
extremists acting independently have simply adopted the name 
president fw de klerks reforms and stated intention of ending 
apartheid have outraged rightwing whites who have vowed to resist 
any lessening of white privilege 
both de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela have warned that 
heavily armed rightwing whites could undermine blackwhite efforts 
to negotiate a new constitution and end apartheid 
in another development a member of the proapartheid 
conservative party said the party would defy a new law requiring 
public facilities be open to all races 
parliament last month repealed the law permitting the 
segregation of libraries swimming pools and other facilities and 
local municipalities have until oct 15 to comply 
but pikkie coetzee a member of parliament said the facilities 
wont be integrated in the dozens of towns where the conservatives 
control local councils 
people are going to hate each other and there could be 
conflict coetzee told the star newspaper of johannesburg if 
hundreds of blacks arrive to use facilities there just wont be 
space 
the conservatives the official opposition in the white chamber 
of parliament oppose violence and have distanced themselves from 
the recent bomb attacks 
most rightwing whites are afrikaners the dutchdescended 
settlers of south africa who account for about 3 million of the 5 
million whites 
under the countrys apartheid system whites maintain political 
and economic control the 28 million blacks have no voice in 
national affairs

three national veterans groups 
sounded a call to arms at an independence day rally urging the 
countrys 27 million vets to unite behind a petition drive for 
better health benefits 
weve had all we can stand the system is underfunded and 
were not going to take it anymore said larry rivers executive 
director of the veterans of foreign wars which has 3 million 
members nationwide 
the vfw joined the paralyzed veterans of america and amvets in 
calling the rally in williams park which drew at least 2000 
veterans from across the state many in uniform and bedecked with 
campaign ribbons 
the masters of ceremony were adrian cronauer and chris noel 
whose radio voices reached hundreds of thousands of american troops 
in vietnam cronauer was portrayed by robin williams in the movie 
good morning vietnam 
vendors sold hot dogs and popcorn red white and blue balloons 
danced in the breeze and the vets wore american flags in their 
lapels or breast pockets 
under the theme united again a petition was launched urging 
the bush administration and congressional leaders to stop cuts in 
veterans benefits 
veterans leaders say the 124 billion budget being discussed 
for veterans health care is insufficient to keep pace with 
inflation 
without another 1 billion the countrys 172 veterans affairs 
medical centers will be unable to provide in 1991 the level of care 
offered in 1988 said r jack powell executive director of the 
paralyzed veterans which has 14000 members 
veterans were there for the country when america needed 
them powell said the question today is whether the country 
will be there for them in terms of health care 
mall shoppers can buy eyeglasses in an hour powell said but 
veterans at the va often must wait three months a veteran can wait 
eight months or more for a hip replacement operation he added and 
six months to be admitted to a cardiaccare unit 
you tell a veteran youre going to provide cardiac care but 
in six months and hes at risk of a heart attack within an 
hour said powell who retired from the army in 1971 after a land 
mine in vietnam left him paralyzed 
owen ball a 70yearold world war ii veteran and a member of 
the rallys honor guard said he has unsuccessfully fought the va 
for years to get a hearing aid he lost part of his hearing in a 
bomb explosion in london in 1944 
as veterans like the rest of the population age the need for 
health care grows more acute powell said 
if something isnt done about it the country is going to end 
up with an increased burden on medicaid and other indigent 
noncompensated care he said noting that budget squeezes have 
closed clinics at va hospitals and left an estimated 3500 beds 
unused because of staff shortages 
the groups chose florida for the rally because it has a veteran 
population of 15 million with thousands more moving in yearly it 
also has a large activeduty military population and four soon to 
be five va hospitals

forty environmentalists wearing badger masks 
turned up outside the house of commons on wednesday in support of a 
parliamentary bill which seeks to outlaw any interference with 
badgers burrows 
hunting the animals for sport is on the increase in the british 
countryside said the lobbyists members of the royal society for 
nature conservation hunters dig badgers out of their burrows and 
then set dogs to attack and kill the animals 
the conservation society and other animal rights supporters have 
condemned the activity as a barbarous cruelty and a threat to the 
survival of the species 
the parliamentary bill is sponsored by legislator tony banks of 
the opposition labor party it is what is known as a private 
members bill meaning that the government which writes the bulk 
of the legislation that passes through parliament is not involved 
in its progress 
private members bills frequently fail to become law getting 
squeezed out of the parliamentary timetable because of the crush of 
other business

tashima also sentenced mchaffies quality control supervisor 
james hicks 45 of sepulveda to 18 months in prison for 
participating in the scheme to submit false test certifications to 
the government 
a shop floor manager william whitham 37 of lancaster was 
previously sentenced to 20 weekends in prison 
mchaffie pleaded guilty in april to conspiracy and two counts of 
submitting false test certifications to the department of defense 
the other men also admitted wrongdoing 
prosecutors contended that mchaffie saved more than 15 million 
by failing to properly test some 9 million bolts between 1979 and 
1989 
assistant us attorney stephen a mansfield said it was the 
longestrunning fraud against the government by a defense 
contractor uncovered so far 
mchaffie told hicks and whitman to create fake test data and 
fabricate reports to conceal the fraud according to a federal 
complaint filed march 29 
the government alleged bolts sent to general electric cos 
engine division failed testing by an outside laboratory 
the discovery that many of the companys bolts failed to meet 
testing requirements also led to a massive effort to discard them 
from parts suppliers prosecutors said 
general electric alone spent at least 4 million to test a 
sample of bolts the government said 
mchaffie shut down in june 1989 and sold off its assets

france on wednesday exploded a nuclear device at 
its south pacific test site the defense ministry said the nuclear 
test drew an immediate protest from new zealand 
it was the fourth such test announced since may when president 
francois mitterrand promised during a visit to polynesia to make 
them public in the past france had refused to confirm or deny 
reports of nuclear tests despite protests from pacific nations 
over its policy 
the defense ministry said the latest test at the mururoa atoll 
yielded less than 35 kilotons new zealands department of 
scientific and industrial research in wellington said the test 
measured approximately 20 kilotons 
new zealands prime minister geoffrey palmer immediately 
issued a statement expressing his disappointment at the test and 
its timing he said it offers further evidence that france cares 
little for the protests of south pacific nations 
it is particularly insensitive that they should be testing 
now a matter of days before a group of leaders from south 
pacific nations meet in the pacific island nation of vanuatu he 
said 
palmer said he was also disappointed that the test should come a 
day after france had announced it would be an observer at the 
nonproliferation treaty review conference 
we saw this as a positive signal that france shared the 
concern of treaty members including new zealand on the horizontal 
proliferation of nuclear weapons technology to more countries 
palmer said 
but now we see that france is continuing to ignore opposition 
to vertical proliferation the acquisition of more and improved 
weapons by existing nuclear weapons states 
palmer said france knew that by continuing to use the south 
pacific to perfect its nuclear weapons it was acting in a manner 
completely unacceptable to new zealand and other countries in the 
region 
since changing its policy on announcing the tests france has 
said it exploded nuclear devices on june 2 june 7 and june 26 at 
mururoa

the director of an aids 
support group says hes helped eight aids sufferers commit suicide 
by providing them with large doses of prescription drugs 
ive been at the bedside of more than 100 people at the moment 
of their death eight of those people ive helped said david 
lewis 38 who also is being treated for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
lewis a director of the vancouver persons with aids society 
said he obtained prescription drugs and put enough for a fatal 
overdose within reach of the patients who usually are bedridden 
i think its immoral and unethical to not help someone die if 
thats what they want he said tuesday 
lewis said he wouldnt help people commit suicide over nothing 
more than emotional despondency but maintained that people nearing 
death and in pain from aids face different circumstances 
ive not pushed pills down anybodys throat he said but 
ive certainly complied with peoples desires 
it is a crime in canada to counsel or assist a suicide some 
people have been tried for such acts in the united states but there 
is no record of a conviction in canada 
lewis said he received legal advice that he would not be 
convicted if he withheld the names of the eight people 
theres nothing really that we can do about that without some 
disclosure of who the victims were vancouver police constable 
bob cooper said wednesday we would have to prove mr x committed 
suicide and that he was assisted in doing so by mr y 
cooper said police werent about to start an investigation based 
on a newspaper interview but planned to meet with prosecutors for a 
general discussion of euthanasia 
british columbia solicitor general russ fraser deferred 
questions wednesday to provincial attorney general bud smith 
ill check with him myself fraser said 
phillip scarisbrick a vancouver lawyer speaking for the 
canadian bar association said lewis could face criminal charges 
if this fellow flaunts his activities enough theyd be forced 
to prosecute him scarisbrick added 
however brian greenspan of toronto president of the ontario 
criminal lawyers association and vice chairman of the canadian bar 
associations criminal justice section said lewis might not be 
liable under the law 
im really not sure if hes committed an offense greenspan 
said 
he explained that to obtain a conviction prosecutors would have 
to prove that lewis helped someone commit suicide rather than 
merely provided an opportunity to commit suicide 
prosecutors also can exercise discretion in deciding whether to 
file charges he added 
its not a blackandwhite issue as to whether you prosecute 
or dont greenspan said 
euthanasia for aids patients is a political hot potato 
however so authorities might be reluctant to act scarisbrick said 
canadian law turns a blind eye to certain behavior said 
professor earl winkler who teaches ethics at the university of 
british columbia 
i think people like david lewis have a lot of courage he 
said 
lewis said he knows some people oppose to his activities but 
i suspect those are people who are not themselves with a terminal 
illness

chancellor helmut kohl is ready to 
have the size of a united german military negotiated at ongoing 
conventional arms reduction talks in vienna his chief spokesman 
said wednesday 
the west german leader and the heads of the 15 other north 
atlantic treaty organization members gather in london thursday and 
friday to discuss the future role of the western alliance in a 
rapidly changing europe 
kohls spokesman hans klein said the west german chancellor 
considered discussions on a united germanys military strength to 
be among the highest priorities of the vienna arms talks 
as the two germanys rush toward unification moscow has raised 
concerns over such issues as the size of a united german army the 
military alignment of a unified germany and what to do with the 
approximately 380000 soviet troops now in east germany 
klein did not mention any possible limit on the size of a united 
germanys armed forces 
news reports over the weekend said the defense ministry wanted 
to halve east germanys military and limit the total strength of a 
combined german military to no more than 400000 
east germany has about 100000 soldiers west germany about 
495000 however west germany has already said it plans to reduce 
its total troop strength to 400000 in five to six years 
klein said kohl would also reemphasize at the nato summit his 
commitment to full membership for a united germany in the western 
alliance which the soviets have so far rejected 
he will also support a greater role for the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has been pressing for a 
formal role for the 35nation conference in european security 
matters with regular meetings of leaders of the member countries 
the soviets have proposed the conference serve in the future as 
an umbrella security organization in place of nato and the 
crumbling warsaw pact the united states has opposed the idea

a 151 million judgment has been entered 
against former philippines first lady imelda marcos in a washington 
state case in which she and her late husband were found liable in 
the murders of two antimarcos activists 
mrs marcos was acquitted monday with saudi financier adnan 
khashoggi of federal racketeering and fraud charges that she helped 
loot her homelands treasury of 222 million and spent it on art 
and real estate much of it in new york 
the 151 million judgment entered june 19 in a federal court 
in new york and june 27 in a state court here clears the way for 
the slain mens families to attach marcos property in new york the 
judgments were published in the new york law journal on tuesday 
on dec 15 a civil jury in a federal court in seattle found 
marcos the late deposed president of the philippines and mrs 
marcos liable in the 1981 murders of the two filipino activists 
marcos estate and his widow were ordered to pay more than 15 
million to the survivors of silme domingo and gene viernes the 
jury awarded domingos wife and two young daughters 128 million 
and viernes wife 23 million 
richard hibey lead attorney for the marcoses blamed the 
verdict on the couples unpopularity and said he would appeal 
which could delay payment of the award for years 
the jury decided that the marcoses were conspirators in the 
deaths of the two men and were negligent in failing to control 
their intelligence agents in the united states 
domingo and viernes both 29 and leaders of the alaska cannery 
workers union were slain in the unions seattle office on june 1 
1981 four weeks after they successfully sponsored a resolution 
calling for an investigation of antiunion activity in the 
philippines 
the case alleged that a marcos friend in san francisco used 
15000 from a corporation he controlled to pay for the murders 
and that the marcoses had a network in the united states to 
monitor harass and intimidate their opponents 
three men were convicted in 1981 and 1982 of murdering domingo 
and viernes but those trials did not result in a finding that 
there was a marcoslinked conspiracy 
the marcoses fled a popular revolt in their homeland in 1986 and 
moved to hawaii ferdinand marcos died there in september before 
the racketeering case in which his wife was acquitted went to trial

the government on wednesday applied for 
full membership in the european economic community a move it 
believes will help unite wardivided cyprus 
this is a great day for cyprus and were very proud 
president george vassiliou leader of the east mediterranean 
islands greek cypriot majority told reporters 
cyprus with a population of nearly 700000 has been associated 
with the ec for 17 years it is the only nonmember that has signed 
a customs union with the 12member bloc 
the island has been cut in two since 1974 when the turkish army 
invaded in the wake of a shortlived coup by supporters of union 
with greece 
the turks seized the northern onethird of the island which was 
proclaimed a breakaway turkish cypriot republic in 1983 only 
turkey recognizes the turkish sector 
turkey applied for european community membership in 1987 but 
its application has been held up partly because of the communitys 
reluctance to admit new members before its scheduled economic 
integration in 1992 
the community is also believed to have reservations because of 
alleged human rights violations in turkey and the turkish presence 
in northern cyprus 
turkey objects to cyprus seeking membership of the european bloc 
without the consent of the turkish cypriot minority who form an 
estimated 18 percent of the islands population 
rauf denktash the turkish cypriot leader has threatened to 
boycott a new round of unsponsored peace talks with vassiliou if 
the greek cypriots applied for eec membership 
the talks on a un proposal for a twozone federation have been 
deadlocked for months 
turkey has also rejected un resolutions demanding the 
withdrawal of an estimated 30000 turkish troops and 50000 
mainland settlers from north cyprus and the return of 200000 greek 
cypriot refugees who fled or were expelled from the north 
the turks insist the troops and settles must stay as a security 
guarantee ankara also rejects the return of greek cypriots to 
their former homes

riot police briefly arrested the six 
leaders of a 3dayold government workers strike wednesday as the 
walkout called by prosandinista unions gained momentum 
police had detained the strike leaders at the sandinista workers 
center just before they were scheduled to give a news conference 
lucio jimenez head of the national workers front said he and 
five others were arrested for disturbing the peace 
we were freed because of pressure from the public and the 
students jimenez said at the university of central america 
within minutes of his release 
no comment was immediately available from authorities 
it was the first time leaders of organized labor were arrested 
during the 2monthold administration of president violeta barrios 
de chamorro 
the arrests came after mrs chamorro who defeated sandinista 
leader daniel ortega in the feb 25 national elections called the 
strike strictly political she accused the sandinista party of 
trying to sabotage her efforts to revive the economy 
what every strike sabotage or anarchy does is to reduce the 
good effects of my governments economic policy and the ones who 
suffer most are the people she said in a televised message late 
tuesday 
the sandinista national liberation front officially threw its 
support behind the strike wednesday and said it is the fruit of 
the economic political and social measures dictated by the 
government 
the arrested leaders included lucio jimenez secretary general 
of the sandinista workers center edgardo garcia secretary general 
of the sandinistas farm workers association and jose angel 
bermudez secretary general of the national employees union 
unions called out the nations 100000 government workers monday 
to protest what it said were massive firings since mrs 
chamorro took office april 25 the strike at first attracted little 
support and only a few thousand workers walked off their jobs 
salaries which were raised 100 percent to settle a may strike 
that paralyzed the country were not an issue 
the sandinistas said the strike was also called to protest 
government economic policies which they claim favor the rich 
and could lead to social unrest 
the chamorro administration plans to cut spending by selling 
most stateowned industries and trimming the bureaucracy it also 
wants to dismantle 10 years of sandinista efforts to create a 
socialist system in nicaragua 
wednesday hundreds of customs workers walked off their jobs and 
joined the strikers at the selin shible customs office in managua 
about 40 trucks waiting to have their cargo checked went unattended 
telecommunications and postal workers stepped up their work 
stoppages from one to two hours a day on wednesday union 
representative sonia ortiz said they would increase little by 
little the stoppage until we reach total strike 
thousands of employees in government agriculture construction 
metalworking and textiles were also striking 
jose angel bermudez leader of the national employees union 
said walkouts will increase because the strike is scaled

a 90yearold man was a free man 
wednesday after jurors acquitted him of bludgeoning to death three 
housemates in a retirement home rampage 
thank you to the jury and the judge thats all i want to 
say henry thomas said as he left the pasco county courthouse 
late tuesday cleared of the new years day 1989 slayings 
one of his attorneys cried as the verdict was read following 
five hours of jury deliberations 
its a great day said thomas who had spent the last 18 
months in jail 
he was taken in his wheelchair from the courthouse to the east 
pasco detention center and released 
two residents died at the scene and a third left with a 
fractured skull died a month later three others recovered from 
injuries 
defense attorneys had argued there was too much doubt that 
thomas did or even physically could have carried out the 
beatings they said three residents of the group home described the 
attacker as a young man 
police arrested thomas his clothes spattered with blood and 
said he had attacked the victims with his heavy oak cane his cane 
had traces of blood and a bone fragment 
thomas said he saw and heard intruders and fled out the front 
door when they began beating his roommates he was picked up 12 
hours later 
despite his age prosecutors portrayed thomas as a strong fit 
man a onetime boxer who got the better of a man 70 years his 
junior while in a cell in may during the jail confrontation 
thomas had an arm lock on a 20yearold until a guard broke it up 
when he heard the young man call for help 
authorities said the retired fruit picker had trouble getting 
along with other elderly residents in the reflections i home that 
housed nine people about 45 miles northeast of tampa thomas shared 
a 10footby9 room with two others 
they said he argued often becoming angry over such incidents as 
when his things were moved by others 
assistant public defender william eble in tears as the verdict 
was read said thomas would be reunited with his family 
members of the thomas family linked hands to pass through a line 
of reporters continuing to refuse to talk 
eble and assistant public defender john carballo helped thomas 
stand as the verdicts were given 
as he listened to circuit judge wayne cobb issue a formal 
finding of innocence thomas lifted the index finger of his right 
hand in a saluting gesture to the judge cobb nodded in return 
the verdicts prompted emotional applause in the courtroom 
while some celebrated charles and helen tear struggled with the 
outcome helen tear owned the home and her fatherinlaw frank 
tear sr was among those killed 
i was angry at the applause mrs tear said obviously 
this was like a party 
the tears testified for the prosecution and believe that thomas 
committed the murders 
i turned this over to the lord a long time ago charles tear 
said if this is his will then i accept it 
prosecutor phil van allen had no comment on the verdict

from the energy department that dramatic cost increases in cleaning 
up nuclear weapons waste will yield a safer environment not bigger 
profits for contractors 
the department said tuesday it will take about 50 percent more 
money and twice as many people as earlier projected to clean up 
radioactive waste at weapons plants over the next five years 
i think there is support on the capitol hill for this but 
people are going to start asking what is being cleaned up what is 
being accomplished rep norm dicks dwash said tuesday 
i worry about how much of the money is going into the pockets 
of the contractors and how much actual cleanup is being done he 
said

the 101st congress has nearly all its 
important work remaining for its frantic final weeks of legislating 
with success riding on cooperation with president bush 
deficit reduction clean air and child care are three big issues 
on the agendas of both bush and the democratic congress to 
accomplish them theyll have to put aside the pattern that 
dominated the first 18 months of their relationship 
bush has proven a dozen times that he can veto bills and not be 
overridden hes beaten back congressional attempts to expand 
federal financing for abortions and loosen restrictions on 
politicking by federal employees 
on the other hand he cant always get what he wants if the 
democrats dont want to give it to him he has been denied his 
first choice for secretary of defense a cut in the capital gains 
tax and an amendment to the bill of rights to ban flag burning 
weve been between the 20 yard lines in the 101st said rep 
ed jenkins dga nobodys moving across anybodys goal line 
that confrontation and stalemate pattern is likely to continue 
on the socalled values issues such as abortion and possibly 
on federal funding of indecent art 
just last week bush vetoed legislation to mandate unpaid leave 
for workers who need to take care of new babies or sick relatives 
chances for an override appear slim 
but the overall relationship between bush and congress appears 
to be turning the legislative successes widely expected when bush 
a former house member took office could be on the way 
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expect theyll break the 
ice on the big meatandpotatoes legislating that will mark them 
all as failures if it isnt done 
i dont think weve got to enact every single one but 
certainly many of them for this to be fairly characterized as a 
successful congress said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine 
rep jerry lewis rcalif chairman of the house republican 
conference said bush was well positioned to come out a winner 
bush is not just talented but extremely clever politically and 
legislatively he said 
the biggest problem is time 
congress has less than nine working weeks scheduled before its 
early october preelection adjournment and issues with little 
chance of passage such as campaign finance reform and a 
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget will eat time 
much of the current discussion in congress hinges on the budget 
talks since money for any new initiatives must be balanced against 
the demand for reducing the deficit 
discussing the budget and his pledge for cooperation on that 
front bush lamented last week that if he had a republican congress 
we might not even be talking about this today 
the comment was a political bone for gop lawmakers hurt by 
bushs decision to support raising taxes as part of a deficit 
reduction plan besides losing one of their best issues 
republicans were angry at bushs close cooperation with the 
democrats 
in addition to the budget bush will be under pressure to accept 
the democratic congress bills on child care rights for the 
disabled tougher standards for oil tankers farm programs and 
crime 
the administration is negotiating with congress on those issues 
prior to final passage in an effort to get bills that bush wont 
feel compelled to veto hes already struck a compromise with the 
senate on a major new housing bill 
all of those bills fall in the category of what one top house 
democrat called bushs im for that too approach to politics 
but mitchell complained in an interview that in the case of the 
oil tanker bill bush has been a major obstacle to action the 
house and senate passed different versions of the legislation last 
year but a final resolution has been held up 
mitchell said hes willing to force confrontation on that and 
other issues unless the president gets on board 
i think we have set the agenda and ultimately he will not 
be able to prevent the congress from establishing a good record in 
this session said mitchell who is in his first term as senate 
leader and eager to prove himself 
senate gop leader bob dole rkan reminded the democrats last 
week that cooperation from bush wasnt enough 
now comes the really hard part getting down to specific 
spending and revenue proposals dole said of the budget summit 
he viewed the football field a little differently we are now 
on the 20 yard line only 80 yards left to go

businesses not individuals are becoming the 
victims of choice in the thriving crime of telephone fraud 
industry experts believe 
phone fraud accounts for 500 million in losses or about 1 
percent of the 50 billion in revenues earned by long distance 
carriers annually says the communications fraud control 
association a mclean vabased group 
traditionally long distance ripoffs consisted mainly of calling 
card fraud mostly unauthorized use of individuals or businesses 
carrierissued calling card billing numbers other phone service 
thieves used socalled black boxes that emit a tone to allow 
access to long distance lines 
but individual calling card fraud is being taken over rapidly by 
another scam one that victimizes business telephone systems 
called private branch exchanges or pbxs 
abusers are now going after the more vulnerable pbxs and are 
having a field day said rami abuhamdeh whose association is 
financed by telephone companies and law enforcement agencies 
pbx scams target a feature on the phone system that allows 
company employees to dial into the home office usually on an 800 
or wats line from outside then after punching in a personal 
identification number they get a second dial tone and can make 
calls as if they were sitting at their desk 
calls made using this feature called reorigination allow the 
company to save the additional charges that long distance carriers 
assess for calling card use 
to get the 3to4 digit security codes computer hackers use 
programs on their own personal computers equipped with a telephone 
modem they can automatically dial numbers sequentially until they 
hit upon the right combination to access an outgoing line 
a hacker can even start the program before he goes to bed and by 
the time he wakes up in the morning hell have hacked out the code 
number said bob fox of united telecomus sprint 
abuhamdeh claims that thieves are targetting pbxs in part 
because larger long distance companies have beefed up their 
security against calling card fraud 
access codes also have been sold by disgruntled employees at 
some companies 
according to fox calling card fraud at us sprint is down to 
insignificant numbers but for businesses victimized by pbx fraud 
losses can be staggering 
fox said 30000 to 40000 in extra charges are not unusual 
abuhamdeh said new york citys human resources administration 
lost 700000 in two months after someone inside the agency sold 
codes to outsiders 
among the most innovative attempts at eliminating remote access 
fraud is a device developed by us sprint that can recognize the 
precise voice pattern of a legitimate customer 
the customer after registering his voice pattern with the long 
distance carrier simply says his identification number into the 
phone and the voice recognition device verifies the users identity 
it applies to both long distance comanies and pbx users the 
technology is at point right now where its changing every day and 
becoming better abuhamdeh said 
companies can take immediate steps to fight against pbx fraud by 
increasing remote access code numbers to as many digits as the 
system allows and not using numbers in sequential order fox says 
fox also recommends that companies turn off the reorigination 
feature of a pbx during hours when it is not normally used and 
review remote access records as frequently as possible 
voice recognition systems and pbx fraud were among the main 
items on the agenda of the communications fraud control 
associations annual conference last month in pentaggon city va 
over 150 attendees representing more than 100 firms and 
organizations participated in the conference

bart simpson may be a cocky upstart in the land 
of television but the spikyhaired cartoon kid already is a champ 
in the gift and novelty industry 
products bearing his image including tshirts college 
insignia sweat shirts refrigerator magnets key rings buttons and 
posters are the hottest items at the atlanta national gift amp 
accessories market 
buyers attending the quarterly atlanta show are stocking up for 
the fall and winter months so exhibit space in the 200plus 
showrooms is stocked heavily with backtoschool and christmas 
items 
bart homer and the rest of the clan from the fox tv show the 
simpsons have arrived with a bang exhibitors said and unlike 
batman ubiquitous last year but virtually absent now the 
popular nuclear family looks to be a longrunning hit for novelty 
dealers 
to say its the hottest item weve had is an understatement 
hes the hottest thing ive seen in 10 years said chris nilan 
sales manager for nilans alley inc which sells novelty items to 
stores throughout the southeast 
nilan showing off a wall full of bart knickknacks said he 
expects to reap 2 million in sales from simpsons merchandise 
within the next six months thats about four times what he made 
from et the extraterrestrial movie character that sparked a 
craze in the 1980s 
this has a wider demographic appeal nilan said wednesday 
the second day of the 10day show the kids love it and the 
parents love it too and the yups think hes the neatest thing 
since hershey bars 
nilan said demand for simpsons items has been made even more 
intense because the creators of the program are limiting the 
licensing of products the people who didnt react early are not 
going to have it he said 
not everyone loves bart though nilan said he has stopped 
carrying tshirts with the simpson kid and the slogan 
underachiever and proud of it because of complaints from 
parents that it was sending out the wrong message 
exhibit space at the show also prominently features dozens of 
items emblazoned with other pop icons such as the new kids on the 
block dick tracy and teenage mutant ninja turtles as well as 
standbys mickey mouse bugs bunny and the muppets 
then there are such items as dancing cocacola cans and statues 
of liberty they are flexible table top radios that like last 
years hit novelty item the dancing flower sway to the music 
such items carry on the tradition of oddly appealing but utterly 
useless objects as the pet rock and the mood ring 
thats the gift industrys dream who is going to come up 
with the next pet rock said suzanne pruitt a spokeswoman for 
the atlanta market center which hosts the show 
the gift show also offers a number of accessories for the 
hardtoplease executive 
darrah amp co ltd a regional wholesaler is taking orders for 
the stress express a desktop launching pad that ejects a miniature 
helicopter 
its for the busy executive who is stressed out and cant 
think of anything better to do said michael gabelman a sales 
representative for atlantabased darrah you set up landing pads 
around the office 
gabelman added that one of his bestselling items recently has 
been a line of recycled stationery products being marketed in 
response to the heightened interest in the environment 
despite the cartooninspired items and offbeat novelties the 
industry also relies heavily on traditional themes said ms pruitt 
one showroom called classic collections features such 
things as handpainted welcome signs and oldfashioned bird houses 
ms pruitt also noted that a seminar at the show is devoted to 
showing shop owners how to establish a bridal registry marriage 
is back in she said

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has 
appealed to world leaders preparing for the houston economic summit 
to forgive part of polands foreign debt 
in letters to the heads of state of japan canada west germany 
the united states great britian italy and france mazowiecki 
expressed readiness for broad cooperation in seeking a solution 
acceptable to all parties concerned the official pap news agency 
reported wednesday 
the seven leaders are to meet for three days starting monday in 
houston texas to discuss international economic issues 
polish economists and their western advisers including the 
world bank have said restructuring the countrys 42 billion debt 
is crucial for the success of its economic overhaul 
polands western debt is the largest in eastern europe its 
repayment obligations would consume virtually of its export 
earnings leaving little money to invest in its struggling economy 
in february the government announced it would freeze payments 
on its debts 
later that month it reached agreement on rescheduling 10 
billion in debt with the paris club an informal grouping of 
creditor governmemts that holds about 27 billion of polands debt 
about 9 billion is held by private banks and the rest is owed to 
international organizations 
the february accord reduced by about a quarter polands yearly 
payment obligations but poland has been urging its western 
partners to cancel part of the debt as a practical necessity and as 
a way to support the country in its transformation to democracy 
western governments have backed polands ambitious effort to 
transform its socialist economy into a capitalist system but have 
been reluctant to cancel debts 
much of the credit was extended to the the communist regime of 
the 1970s it was used for massive but poorly conceived 
industrial projects that failed to produce anticipated profits and 
for a flood of consumer goods in an attempt to win public affection

if laughter can fend off disease it should 
be able to help revive an ailing business 
thats the premise pushed by malcolm kushner an author and 
selfstyled humor consultant he claims people who elicit 
laughs at work get more done and go further than their sourpuss 
colleagues 
i teach people to communicate the fact that they have a sense 
of humor said kushner 37 whose the light touch how to use 
humor for business success simon and shuster 1895 recently 
hit book stores 
he cant teach the delivery of jay leno or the lightningquick 
wit of robin williams but kushner tries to point out where humor 
fits in the workplace as well as whats appropriate and whats not 
racial and sexual slurs are always inappropriate but kushner 
says a competitor can be used effectively as the butt of a joke 
his example how can you tell when a competitors executive 
has been using a word processor 
answer theres whiteout on the screen 
humor acts as a magnet that draws people in and it can help 
make a point kushner asserts it also softens stress motivates 
people helps resolve conflicts and shields hostile remarks he 
says 
managing selling negotiating planning decision making 
all the fundamental tasks associated with business life become a 
little bit simpler when people are prejudiced in your favor he 
writes in his book 
lee iacocca ronald reagan and mario cuomo have shown that 
successful people dont have to be afraid to joke around kushner 
says indeed having fun at your own expense can be a powerful 
tool he says 
for eight years ronald reagan poked fun at how old he was 
and we loved it kushner said in a recent interview when the 
iran contra scandal hit everyone wanted to give the guy the 
benefit of the doubt imagine the same scandal hitting nixon or 
carter we would have said nail the guy the first day 
kushner quit his job as a lawyer with a san francisco firm eight 
years ago and took up humor consulting hes had some tough 
clients including the internal revenue service and the san 
francisco sheriffs department 
hes also worked with many fortune 500 companies focusing on 
the silicon valley which is close to his santa cruz home 
bob brownson a senior marketing executive for digital equipment 
corp in maynard mass said he has hired kushner twice at a rate 
of about 1500 for a oneday seminar and 3000 for a dinner 
presentation 
he did an excellent job of improving the quality of our 
meetings so that we could get on with the more important business 
he got us to lighten up and look at ourselves in a little more 
realistic way he said 
you work so hard in our business you begin to believe that 
selling a computer is the most important thing in the world and 
its not 
kushner cites a 1983 stanford university study that found 
laughter can have the same healthimproving effects as regular 
exercise although he has no statistics to prove it kushner says 
the same medicine might improve the financial health of a company 
his book outlines dozens of techniques for introducing humor 
into conversation and presentations humorous personal anecdotes 
are great icebreakers and old jokes are useful as analogies he 
says 
selfeffacing humor can make a person more likeable he says 
his book cites fred hoar an executive with miller 
communications in mountain view calif as an example in a chapter 
called building yourself up by putting yourself down 
a veteran silicon valley advertising and public relations 
executive hoar knows that his name has an unfortunate connotation 
particularly when linked with his profession kushner writes 
the executive starts his presentations by saying my name is 
fred hoar 
thats fred

two dozen rich nations wednesday 
extended their aid program for poland and hungary to four other 
east european nations that have shed their communist ways for 
freemarket economies 
the countries remained divided on the question of extending aid 
to the soviet union however west germany wants quick action on 
such aid while the united states and japan want to wait for further 
reforms there 
the agreement to grant financial aid to bulgaria yugoslavia 
czechoslovakia and east germany came at a meeting of foreign 
ministers of the oranization for economic cooperation and 
development a parisbased group of industrial democracies 
the ministers excluded romania from the aid package because of 
doubts about its commitment to democratic reforms 
wednesdays meeting did not fix specific aid figures these will 
emerge in the months ahead as each donor makes its own pledges in 
food money credits loan guarantees and other assistance 
it was a conference designed to take stock see whether we 
should and could decided to add countries to the aid package 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd told reporters 
aid to the new east european beneficiaries is bound to run into 
billions of dollars in the long term 
already the 24 donor nations have pledged more than 124 
billion in food economic and environmental aid to poland and 
hungary since they began coordinating their aid program last summer 
the aid effort is coordinated by the european community 
commission the executive body for the group of 12 west european 
countries 
in a communique the ministers said the four additional 
beneficiaries of aid merited help in view of the reforms they have 
begun based on the rule of law the respect of human rights the 
introduction of multiparty systems the holding of free and fair 
elections and the establishment of market economies 
of romania where newly elected officials relied on miners last 
month to suppress antigovernment protests they said 
recent events in romania have not created the conditions in 
which the implementation of coordinated assistance should be 
extended to that country under present circumstances 
aid to the soviet union will be discussed at next weeks summit 
of the leaders of the worlds seven most industrialized nations in 
houston texas the issue also is under review within the ec 
we cannot expect the soviet union to resolve problems 
regarding the transition to a market economy on their own west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told reporters 
they urgently need help not only financial but in the form of 
advice it is in the common western interest to give this support 
to the soviet union because a deterioration of the situation will 
put soviet president mikhail s gorbachev off course and in 
danger 
but us secretary of state james a baker iii said he wants to 
see more reforms in the soviet union 
we take note of the fact that the soviet union is spending 
somewhere between 18 and 25 percent of its gross domestic product 
on military expenditures he told reporters 
and we have problems with the expenditure of somewhere 
between nine and 15 billion a year to support regimes around the 
world that in the past at least have been hostile to the views and 
interests and principles of the united states 
the soviet union unlike the four countries that were added to 
the western aid program wednesday has not asked for western aid 
but the issue of western aid has become linked to efforts to win 
soviet backing for immediate and full membership of a united 
germany in the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
wednesdays meeting was attended by officials from poland 
hungary and the four new beneficiary countries 
bulgarian foreign minister boiko dimitrov said of countrys 
economic reforms the stupendous task that we are facing is 
insurmountable without substantive international support 
witold trzeciakowski who led the polish delegation said only 
a continuing support of the developed countries will allow the 
polish people to persevere in this difficult and dangerous 
transition process 
east germany was accepted as a new aid recipient although it has 
merged its economy with west germanys 
the oecds member nations are australia austria belgium 
britain canada denmark finland france greece iceland 
ireland italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand 
norway portugal spain sweden switzerland turkey the united 
states and west germany

t boone pickens the texas oilman rebuffed in his 
attempts to get a seat on the board of koito manufacturing co 
plans to turn up the pressure by boosting his stake in the japanese 
auto parts supplier 
pickens said he will move quickly to raise his stake in koito to 
33 percent from 26 percent despite having his request for four 
board seats soundly rejected at koitos annual stockholders meeting 
last week 
well probably start this week pickens said wednesday 
wed like to move up to onethird ownership if we can 
pickens has spent 1 billion on his stake so far he said it 
would cost about 200 million more to buy the 10 million shares 
that would bring him to 33 percent with such a stake pickens said 
japanese law would allow him to take part in some decisions made by 
koito management 
the reason is that it gives us additional power as a 
stockholder pickens said that threshold is important in 
corporate japan 
pickens and koito have been battling for the past 16 months 
pickens the companys largest shareholder has demanded seats on 
koitos board koito has said pickens is interested only in 
greenmail and points to his reputation as a corporate raider 
greenmail is a practice of buying up large amounts of a 
companys stock to force the company to buy it back at a premium to 
maintain control 
pickens and a delegation of about 50 americans stormed out of 
koitos annual meeting last week after a stormy session that pitted 
his delegation against the companys japanese shareholders 
he said he had a tape recording of insults that japanese 
shareholders yelled to the american delegation during the meeting 
he said the japanese called the americans dumb and repeatedly told 
them to go home 
the translator was telling us some of them but i wasnt aware 
that this was going on at the time pickens said addingg that he 
received a translation of the tape this week 
pickens has long contended that koito management is biased 
against foreigners and participates in japans keiretsu system 
which links companies and their suppliers 
pickens believes that toyota motor co koitos secondlargest 
stockholder and the biggest buyer of its parts has played a major 
role behind the scenes to keep him and his representatives off the 
companys board 
he has contended that toyota uses its muscle to win lower prices 
from koito and thereby gain profits at the expense of koito 
shareholders 
pickens plans to take his complaints to the international 
economic summit in houston next week 
i will certainly talk to anybody that will listen about the 
unfairness that i see in corporate japan he said we are fools 
to open our markets to the japanese when they dont allow us to 
participate in theirs

advertisements touting general motors corps 
buick division as the most troublefree usmade car were already 
being made by the time a survey showing that ranking was released 
gm learned last month that for the second year in a row buick 
would rank in the top 10 in the jd power and associates initial 
quality survey advertising departments worked overtime to cash in 
on the ranking buick advertising director jay qualman said tuesday 
tuesday the day after the survey was released a dozen 
television commercials were poised for broadcast nationally to brag 
about the power surveys ranking 
weve been working around the clock to get it ready to run

carmakers use the power survey much as they do car or 
truckoftheyear awards given out by automotive magazines if a 
companys vehicle ranks high they brag about it if not they 
ignore it 
we do look at those awards very hard qualman said 
consumers should expect to see ads from automakers whose 
vehicles ranked high on the survey quality is increasingly 
important to buyers and the industry acts accordingly 
gm is in the midst of a program called putting quality on the 
road in which every gm employee is acting as a surrogate 
salesperson urging friends and acquaintances to consider buying gm 
products 
chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca in may wound up a sixcity 
tour praising his companys cars as having quality as good as any 
others 
for years ford motor co has hung on to the advertising line 
quality is job one 
although domestic automakers have been harping on quality in 
their advertising overseas companies consistently rank higher than 
their us cousins in power surveys 
in the latest survey detailed in the power report a monthly 
publication by the agoura hills califbased marketing company 
toyota motor corps lexus division got the best scores among car 
brand names

on the truck side mazda ranked highest with its pickup rated 
the most troublefree model the highestranking us truck brand 
was ford at no 4 among specific models ford also had the highest 
ranking among us makers with its bronco ii holding down the no 
5 spot among all trucks 
the power initial quality survey compiled responses from about 
26000 buyers of 1990 model cars and about 6500 answers from among 
19000 truck buyers 
each was asked about problems encountered during the first three 
months of ownership in a dozen broad areas including squeaks and 
rattles paint and water leaks 
automakers and their specific vehicles were ranked on a basis of 
number of problems reported per 100 vehicles sold the topranked 
lexus division for instance had 82 problems reported per 100 
vehicles while the lexus ls400 car had 74 problems per 100 
the results are spelled out in a 200plus page report with

sales of american flags are enjoying new 
glory this year in a sales boost that flag companies attribute to 
increased patriotism and the bitter debate about burning old glory 
its been a banner year and thats not just a flag company 
joke said steve sevits vice president of sales for the uneeda 
flag company located near albany 
by independence day the flag season is in full swing but its 
not just the traditionally patriotic holidays memorial day flag 
day presidents day and the fourth of july that accelerate sales 
flag companies say the supreme courts june ruling against state 
laws that ban burning of the american flag also has boosted sales 
the flagburning issue got the patriotic movement going 
again said david liberman president of the valley forge flag 
co in great neck ny people became more conscious of it and 
went out and bought a flag retail stores even increased their 
stock 
sevits claimed his companys sales were up 17 percent this year 
people are seeing more flags around so they want one he 
said 
sales of fireretardant flags also are up sevits said he sells 
truckloads of flags made from koralex a polyester fiber that 
resists burning 
not only are they fire retardant but they also float in the 
breeze instead of snap snapping wears out a flag more quickly 
he said 
sevits estimated that a flag displayed outdoors typically will 
last from 10 to 15 years depending on weather conditions 
flag industry sales figures are hard to come by because most 
companies are privately owned and manufacturers and dealers are 
reluctant to disclose figures but flag dealers and others in the 
industry generally say sales have been rising for more than a 
decade 
ive been selling flags for 13 years and ive seen sales go up 
each year said david jolly owner of dampm merchandisers inc in 
cohoes ny i think patriotism is the reason for the increase 
business began booming for many flag companies in the mid 1970s 
as the nation prepared to celebrate the 1976 bicentennial liberman 
said 
it was the biggest flagselling period in history he said 
sales escalated in 1979 with the taking of american hostages in 
iran the 1984 olympics in los angeles the 1984 and 1988 
presidential elections and the flagburning issue have continued 
boosting sales liberman said he said flag sales reflect the 
political state of affairs more than than economics 
patriotism is cool now so sales are good liberman said 
valley forge sells millions of flags of various types each year 
at prices ranging from 1 to 2000 said liberman who has worked 
for 20 years at the company his grandfather started after world war

eastern airlines confronts its problems with an 
ambitious campaign that combines personality advertising with 
grainy realism about a company in crisis but publicity experts 
question whether the plan will work 
the 100 days commercials starring courtappointed trustee 
martin shugrue are running primetime and during newscasts in 33 
markets the company wont say how much its spending in the 
campaign in which shugrue admits eastern must climb out of a 
large deep hole 
easterns been a troubled carrier for a long time and theres 
been a buildup of negatives said michael henderson senior vice 
president for advertising 
the appointment of shugrue on april 12 by a federal bankruptcy 
court gave easterns marketers a chance to present a new image 
he represents the most dynamic portrayal of a new beginning 
hes new hes fresh and he doesnt carry any baggage with him 
henderson said 
the 100 days campaign shows shugrue fielding questions from 
eastern employees at a hangar and talking with passengers 
there are references to easterns bad labor relations history 
and crippling machinists strike which began march 4 1989 and led 
to a filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days later 
one passenger mentions maintenance not an issue that airline 
advertising usually addresses 
but shugrue emphasizes change pledging that eastern will be 
better each of the 100 days 
starting today when you fly eastern you wont see many signs 
of the months behind us he says 
he tells employees the human equation will be paramount at 
eastern if that thinking is a change from what youve experienced 
before so be it 
those commercials have angered easterns unions who say shugrue 
cant claim improved labor relations when hes made little progress 
in union negotiations 
easterns commercials intentionally look unprofessional with 
microphones squealing and plane engines roaring 
it looks like it was filmed by some guy across the aisle with 
his home videocam said david williams of new england 
consultants its unrehearsed and realistic thats where a lot 
of sincerity comes from 
williams is among many advertising specialists impressed with 
the campaign but some are skeptical about whether it will help 
turn eastern around 
when youve got a bad name no amount of wellexecuted 
advertising can change it said al ries a connecticutbased 
consultant if you really want to communicate the fact that 
eastern has changed you should change the name 
ries said besides easterns troubled history the name eastern 
makes it sound like a regional carrier irrelevant to people 
elsewhere allegheny airlines changed its fortunes after becoming 
usair he said 
he recalled eastern used personality advertising before when 
frank borman a nationally known hero as an apollo astronaut was 
chief executive if borman couldnt change easterns image ries 
said its doubtful shugrue can 
but henderson said shugrue a veteran airline executive is 
wellknown in the travel industry the campaign is targeted mainly 
at luring business travelers and lessening reliance on unprofitable 
cutrate fares 
the 100 days campaign comes while shugrue is enjoying a 
honeymoon with easterns creditors he was appointed trustee after 
the creditors lost patience with the management led by chairman 
frank lorenzo whose parent company texas air corp has since 
changed its name to continental airline holdings 
the creditors have said they are willing to give shugrue time to 
save eastern theyve dropped for now proposing liquidation of 
the airline which is still in the reorganization phase of federal 
bankruptcy protection laws 
but shugrues honeymoon with easterns unions seems to be over 
the machinists say he has done little to settle their strike and 
eastern pilots who ended their sympathy strike last november are 
unhappy that few pilots have been given their jobs back 
riled by the 100 days commercials 600 union members 
demonstrated june 30 at miami international airport urging the 
public to boycott eastern 
hes trying to be lee iacocca and hes no lee iacocca said 
frank ortis president of machinists local 702 
the chrysler corp commercials featuring iacocca are generally 
considered the most successful use of a corporate chief in 
personality advertising 
if shugrue really wants to make eastern better he would get 
the dedicated professionals who built this airline back to work 
ortis said thats the only way eastern is going to survive

the united states and other western countries 
are being urged to rush to the rescue of the faltering soviet 
economy with an emergency aid package of up to 20 billion 
without such assistance supporters of the plan say soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev could be toppled from power at a 
time when the west is tantalizingly close to signing agreements 
with the soviets on arms control and other important issues on 
close to its own terms 
but opponents say the assistance could end up as a massive waste 
of money that would simply allow gorbachev to delay measures needed 
to institute a marketoriented economy 
president bush will be lobbied extensively by both camps in 
coming days first by other western leaders at the nato summit in 
london on thursday and friday and then at the annual economic 
summit which begins in houston on monday 
the houston meeting bringing together the leaders of the 
worlds seven richest economies will be the first such meeting in 
the united states since 1983 
bush and his counterparts from japan west germany britain 
france italy and canada will be grappling with a contentious trade 
fight over agricultural subsidies as well as considering proposals 
to protect the global environment and relieve the crushing debt 
burden on third world countries 
but the soviet aid question is likely to dominate the 
discussions 
both french president francois mitterrand and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl are pushing to give gorbachev the 15 
billion to 20 billion in western assistance he is seeking in 
outright grants and loans 
just a few months ago the bush administration curtly dismissed 
the idea of western aid to the soviets when it was proposed by 
house democratic leader richard gephardt 
but since that time the administration has come under pressure 
to reverse its opposition especially from kohl who wants soviet 
acquiescence in a speedy unification of east and west germany 
conservatives contend such aid would amount to paying ransom 
money at a time when the soviet government is still spending 
heavily on its own military and supporting client states in cuba 
angola and afghanistan 
asked about soviet aid on tuesday bush repeated his assertion 
that economic reform is essential before aid is extended he 
said billions of dollars had been wasted in the early 1970s in 
western loans to poland before that country was ready to make 
needed reforms 
i have explained to our economic summit partners and to the 
soviets and to others that we have specific problems with 
giving money to the soviet union at this point bush told 
reporters in kennebunkport maine 
but gorbachev stressed in an interview monday that the soviet 
union needs western assistance now not after further economic 
reforms are taken 
i should say at this point we need more cooperation while the 
government is working out measures for the transition to a market 
economy to make this process less painful to make it easier 
gorbachev said in an interview with cbs news after the opening of 
the communist party congress 
behind the scenes the administration appears to be trying to 
work out a compromise on the aid question 
what may emerge at the houston summit is a twotrack approach in 
which western nations willing to provide direct assistance would be 
allowed to do so while the united states and other countries such 
as britain japan and canada would limit their help to technical 
assistance 
among areas being explored by the administration are providing 
experts in such fields as housing banking accounting and 
management training to give advice to the soviets on ways to set up 
a freemarket system 
bush signaled his tolerance for a dual approach last week when 
he said that he didnt want to get into a position of telling kohl 
what his lending policy or his finance policy should be 
the houston summit could end up with a vague statement of 
support for gorbachev that would give individual countries room to 
pursue their own policies 
on trade bush has proclaimed that his no 1 priority in houston 
is breaking a deadlock on global free trade talks 
the united states is demanding a phaseout of all 
tradedistorting farm subsidies within 10 years but europeans are 
fighting the effort which they say could cost 2 million to 3 
million european jobs 
the dispute is threatening to scuttle an ambitious fouryear 
effort to liberalize the world trading system under the 97nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the administration believes that overhauling the gatt rules 
offers the best hope of expanding export opportunities for american 
farmers and businesses and thus lowering the countrys huge trade 
deficit 
the farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers worldwide 245 
billion last year 
without progress in attacking the subsidies the united states 
believes many third world countries will balk at supporting efforts 
to expand gatt rules to cover trade in services such as banking 
and insurance and beef up protection against copyright piracy 
which cost american companies 60 billion annually in lost sales 
the perennial issue of how to ease the 13 trillion third world 
debt burden will also be addressed in houston last week bush 
proposed to forgive part of the 12 billion in debt owed by latin 
american countries to the us government 
in discussing the plan treasury secretary nicholas brady 
conceded that it could set a precedent for offering similar relief 
to debtstrapped eastern european governments such as poland 
at last years economic summit in paris onethird of the final 
communique was devoted to the issue of protecting the global 
environment issues such as global warming and deforestation are 
expected to be addressed in houston as well

an eastern airlines union official thinks it 
would be a great marriage if northwest airlines bought the 
troubled carrier but others say easterns pension liabilities and 
labor troubles would make a deal difficult 
its a fairy tale said rich siakel a spokesman for 
northwests pilots union in bloomington there are pieces that 
make sense but not the whole thing 
some said northwest may be primarily interested in easterns 
atlanta and miami hubs or its east coast routes 
the prospect of an acquisition was raised tuesday by a union 
spokesman who said northwest chairman alfred checchi wants to meet 
with the machinists union to discuss the possibility of northwest 
buying eastern 
everything is just exploratory at this point said jim 
conley a spokesman for the international association of machinists 
in washington 
conley said machinists officials met monday in washington to 
discuss the problems integrating eastern employees into northwests 
operation he said the meeting was a prelude to one with checchi 
but said he does not know when that meeting will take place 
robin matell spokesman for miamibased eastern said a june 
memo to employees said pan am and northwest had shown interest in 
buying eastern but meetings and discussions were not an indication 
of an imminent takeover 
easterns desire is to create a successful independent 
airline but its impossible to rule out a merger or buyout the 
memo said 
officials at eagan minnbased northwest the nations 
fourthlargest carrier would not comment on whether eastern is a 
possible takeover target but checchi repeatedly has made public 
his intention to expand northwest possibly by buying an entire 
airline or parts of one 
eastern the nations ninthlargest airline has been 
reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection from creditors since 
march 1989 when machinists walked off the job pilots and flight 
attendants called off sympathy strikes last november 
since april eastern has been run by courtappointed trustee 
martin shugrue who was an adviser to a group of investors led by 
checchi in a 365 billion buyout of northwest last year 
the leader of the machinists union at eastern frank ortis 
said a northwesteastern merger would be a great marriage 
its speculation but in our opinion it would be a great 
merger and a great buy he said northwest is a great airline 
mr checchi appears to be very good with public relations and labor 
relations 
the machinists form the largest union at northwest and eastern 
representing nearly 24000 workers at northwest and 8500 at 
eastern 
siakel of northwests pilots union said an eastern acquisition 
would invite the kinds of service problems northwest encountered 
with its 1986 takeover of republic airlines 
when northwest and former republic employees were working side 
by side and earning vastly different wages a deterioration of 
morale and service gave rise to the nickname northworst 
william genoese head of the airline division for the 
international brotherhood of teamsters said checchis primary 
interest in eastern is acquiring its atlanta and miami hubs 
northwests only existing southern hub in memphis is not 
producing the way they thought it would it doesnt have the 
traffic genoese said 
but shugrue is only interested in selling eastern if someone 
buys all of it genoese said i dont see anything really 
developing said genoese whose union represents flight 
attendants at northwest 
northwest also would benefit from easterns routes on the east 
coast where northwest is relatively weak said morton beyer 
president of avmark an aviation consulting firm in arlington va 
beyer said deterrents to a merger would be consolidating the two 
work forces and the huge unfunded pension liability northwest would 
inherit 
eastern calculates its unfunded pension liability at 390 
million but a spokeswoman for the federal pension benefit guaranty 
corp said the liability is about 800 million 
yes it is a deterrent beyer said of the pension issue 
but how big a deterrent is actually debatable 
he said a 390 million cost item would not automatically kill a 
deal potentially worth more than 3 billion

american telephone and telegraph co 
has agreed to buy selected parts of western union corps business 
services unit for 180 million 
western union of upper saddle river has been having financial 
troubles for the past few years and is in the midst of a 
restructuring 
under the agreement announced tuesday atampt would buy the assets 
used to provide western unions easylink electronic mail service 
and its telex and packetswitched services 
atampt would take on western unions 1160 business services 
employees and the units customer base said john smart president 
of business communications services in a news release from atampts 
basking ridge offices 
the agreement does not include western union priority services 
which provides mailgram priority letter and custom letter 
services it leaves the company with approximately 2500 employees 
said western union spokesman warren bechtel 
the transaction completes the transformation of western union 
from a telecommunications company to a financial services and 
paperbased messaging business said robert j amman president and 
chief executive officer of western union 
the deal would also help the company pay a major portion of its 
new first priority notes issued to bondholders as part of the 
companys restructuring said amman on june 14 the securities and 
exchange commission approved western unions plan to swap 530 
million in debt for new notes and stock 
western union wrote off 603 million in special charges in the 
first quarter of 1988 in connection with the planned sale of the 
companys microwave voiceswitching facilities in 1988 the 
company reported 32 million in losses 
faced with making a 51 million biannual interest payment by 
june 15 the company told regulators in march that it would have to 
seek bankruptcy court protection if it couldnt meet its debt 
interest payments 
atampt spokeswoman lynn newman said the western union unit earned 
more than 629 million last year and atampt is looking forward to its 
continued profitability 
it wasnt a huge amount of money for a buy but were getting 
a good match with our existing electronic messaging system and 
weve got the added customer base said newman 
the sale needs regulatory approval and is conditioned on 
completion of a western union debt restructuring plan the 
companies said the deal should be completed by september

the world economy is slowing down and 
growth has virtually halted in eastern europe and the soviet union 
as some governments undertake drastic marketoriented reform a 
un study says 
the 1990 world economic survey released tuesday says world 
economic output increased by 31 percent in 1989 compared with 44 
percent in 1988 
industrialized market economies continued to expand growing by 
35 percent and although the figure was lower than the 43 percent 
of 1988 it was stronger than had been expected the report says 
economic growth in the developing world as a whole slowed from 
45 percent in 1988 to 34 percent in 1989 economic performance 
varied greatly by region 
the report agreed in general with the findings of the 
parisbased organization for economic cooperation and development 
which said last week that the economies of the industrialized world 
remain on a steady course 
like the oecd report it warned against inflation especially in 
east european countries that are changing from statecontrolled to 
market economies 
economic growth in eastern europe and the soviet union came to 
a virtual halt in 1989 the report says adding that output 
increased by just 12 percent 
un economists said they do not expect a bright picture for the 
immediate future in countries restructuring their economies 
although the longterm prospects could improve with painful reform 
the danger of rapid inflation in the reforming socialist 
countries is a major concern says the report requiring 
prudent monetary and fiscal policies during the transition to more 
marketoriented economies 
in several latin american countries hyperinflation is a serious 
problem it says and stabilization policies are likely to prove 
costly in the short term longterm prospects are uncertain 
the survey compiled by the un department of international 
economic and social affairs says the economies of south and east 
asia grew by 62 percent last yeasr compared with 82 percent in 
1988 the survey said 
chinas growth rate delined sharply from 114 percent in 1988 
to 39 percent in 1989 
latin america and the caribbean saw just a 07 percent increase 
and per capita output fell for the second consecutive year 
inflation was unprecedented in the region 
in africa economies expanded by 28 percent in 1989 below the 
rate of population growth and per capita output fell as a result 
in west asia economic recovery continued with a 25 percent 
growth rate economic stabilization measures stalled growth in 
mediterranean countries 
the survey proposed establishment of a central european payments 
union similar to the european payments union established after 
world war ii as a temporary measure to assist reforming eastern 
european countries in their transition to marketoriented economies 
with convertible currencies

a run on deposits has forced a state 
government to close a group of lending institutions to prevent a 
chain reaction like the one that hit their american equivalent the 
savingsandloan industry 
victoria state also pledged tuesday that all of the small 
uninsured depositors at the failed farrow corp the southeastern 
states largest such institution would get all their money back 
some 220000 australians had faced the loss of their life 
savings in the failure of farrow the corporation is comprised of 
three socalled building societies which like american sampls were 
primarily established to make homemortgage loans 
the decision to refund the depositors could cost the financially 
troubled state up to 800 million though the final toll will be 
determined after the assets of farrow corp are sold off banks 
that loaned the company money will get first shot at those funds 
analysts say farrows risky loans caused the firm to go under 
a practice also blamed for the failure of sampls in the united states 
that is projected to cost american taxpayers hundreds of billions 
of dollars 
some critics have called for victoria premier john cain to 
resign over the financial crisis which conceivably could lead to 
the fall of the state government victoria australias second most 
populous state with 41 million people includes the coastal city 
of melbourne 
there also could be repercussions on the federal level where 
the labor government of prime minister bob hawke scored a narrow 
victory earlier this year following the loss of nine parliament 
seats in victoria 
governmentappointed administrator ken russell announced sunday 
night that farrow would not be allowed to reopen 
the action followed a run on deposits that dropped farrows 
liquidity from about 316 million in february to about 47 million 
last week 
russell initially warned that some depositors could lose some of 
their money depositors then pressured victoria and threatened to 
file suit pointing out that thenstate treasurer rob jolly had 
assured them in february that their funds were secure 
in response cain said tuesday the government would ensure that 
all small depositors would be repaid in full over an unspecified 
time and would get 20 percent to 25 percent as soon as possible 
to offset a possible crisis in confidence in other building 
societies and avoid a domino effect of runs on deposits cain said 
monday they would be brought into the banking sector gradually 
major banks will support them in the meantime through a line of 
credit guaranteed by the state government 
legislators representing the city of geelong had said that 
without state help the 150000 residents would be hit hard 
geelong was home to one of the failed building societies pyramid 
and half its depositors live there 
businesses using the group for banking cant get running 
funds employees arent getting paid said david henshaw a 
member of the victorian parliament 
russell said the closure resulted from his failure to find a 
buyer for farrow the societies assets now will be sold with 
those proceeds first going to banks that had lent to farrow 
analysts say the failure was due to a highrisk loan strategy 
that fell apart as the commercial property market collapsed 
analysts say the strategy began after the son of farrows founder 
bill farrow and david clarke took over the 50yearold group in 
1986

oil companies operating in the united states 
relied more on foreign production than domestic and spent more 
money overseas to look for new oil for the first time last year 
according to an industry survey 
the shift reflects the steady decline in domestic oil production 
in recent years in part a consequence of relatively weak world oil 
prices and increased concerns about the environmental impact of 
oil exploration and production in the united states the survey 
released tuesday by arthur andersen amp co said 
the broad conclusion we can draw from this years study is 
that the world oil industry is entering a new era and us 
exploration and production companies are successfully adapting to 
the changing environment said victor a burk managing director 
of oil and gas industry services for arthur andersen 
for the first time last year the companies surveyed had greater 
foreign oil reserves than domestic reserves saw oil production 
from foreign sources surpass domestic production and spent more on 
exploration and production for new oil overseas than in the united 
states 
the 11th annual study is based on data on reserve quantity 
value cost and other details filed with the securities and 
exchange commission by 236 public companies for the five years from 
1985 through 1989 
companies in the study included us and canadian firms and 
three major foreign companies with significant us operations 
british petroleum royal dutchshell and broken hill proprietary of 
australia 
in 1989 the companies in the study accounted for more than 60 
percent of the total proved oil and gas reserves and production in 
the united states 
the united states has been the most heavily explored country in 
the world burk said companies are shifting their exploration focus 
abroad because they believe the chances of bigger finds are 
better 
they believe the opportunities right now are greater outside 
the united states he said 
the driving forces behind the changing industry environment 
include continuing declines in us oil production coupled with an 
increase in reliance on imports the dramatic political and 
economic changes in the soviet union and eastern europe and reduced 
soviet oil production and rapid economic growth and oil demand in 
east asian countries burk said 
in addition environmental concerns will fundamentally change
