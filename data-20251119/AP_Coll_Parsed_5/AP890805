a researcher who spends his time studying 
roadside trash has found that most litterbugs are men 
dan syrek whose research provided the basis for a cleanup 
campaign that cut roadside littering by 60 percent in the state 
since 1985 discovered that men did most of the littering and they 
dont respond positively when you use the word please in 
telling them to stop 
some texans found the dont mess with texas campaign a tad 
macho but it worked said syrek who evaluates roadside litter for 
16 state governments 
with his onsite inspections syrek found that men did 70 
percent of all deliberate littering and 90 percent of all 
accidental littering where things fly off the bed of a pickup 
truck for example involve male drivers he said seventyfive 
percent of the men involved were younger than 35 
the 2 million advertising campaign has included appearances by 
country singer willie nelson football players and other 
celebrities 
studying roadside trash is a good way to see the united states 
syrek said 
there is some incredibly beautiful countryside that we get to 
see in detail said syrek at least we do when the litter is 
gone

the annual 10kilometer i do not choose to run honors a 
president who was more of a man for brisk walks said paul 
walker of the greater northampton chamber of commerce 
but cal hasnt been here for a long time he said and the 
tshirts have become a real collectors item 
so prized are the race tshirts that only the first few hundred 
runners to sign up for sundays race will get them the aquamarine 
shirt is emblazoned with a drawing of a buttoneddown coolidge who 
declined to seek a second term in 1928 
coolidge mayor of northampton in 1909 wouldnt have much of a 
constituency now said russ a kotfila who started the run as part 
of a coolidgefest in 1983 on the 50th anniversary of the 30th us

renewed threats to abortion rights should 
be viewed as a significant opportunity to unify the womens 
movement speakers told the national womens political caucus 
we must bring the same spirit to the fight for abortion rights 
that we brought to the fight for the era equal rights 
amendment eleanor holmes norton a georgetown university law 
professor told the caucus biennial convention on friday 
that means leaving no state unturned it means the same grunt 
work this caucus did in state after state for the era there is no 
shortcut no magic pill no easy way she said 
ironically despite internal and perhaps inevitable 
disagreement over tactics this issue can and will bring greater 
unity 
norton and bella abzug a former democratic congresswoman from 
new york and a founder of the 18yearold caucus said they expect 
abortion will be the issue that prompts young women to join the 
fight for womens rights in numbers not seen since the movements 
peak during the 1970s 
it presents an opportunity to revitalize the movement so it 
may complete the mammoth job that remains to secure women their 
rights and their freedoms said norton former chairwoman of the 
equal employment opportunities commission 
norton said the caucus must not underestimate the need for a 
resilient confident mass movement of broad appeal if we are to 
prevail on the troublesome issue of reproductive choices 
but she added we must avoid the singleissue approach of 
the antichoice crowd when seeking to stop efforts to impose 
abortion restrictions authorized by a recent us supreme court 
decision 
abzug said the threat of abortion restrictions will mobilize the 
nations young people like no issue since the vietnam war 
abortion is the vietnam of this generation for young people 
everywhere 
a womans right to decide whether to have children free from 
intrusion or coercion by government or church or the outright 
violence of any individual is as precious and individual a liberty 
as the right to speak and the right to believe and the right to 
pray abzug said 
without the free exercise of that right she said no woman 
can be deemed to be fully free or equal 
the idea that the unborn fetus is entitled to protection 
from the moment of conception is biologically ignorant and 
philosophically outrageous abzug said no civilized nation can 
be allowed to declare an unborn fetus to be a person under the 
constitution before women are declared to be persons under the 
constitution 
although the number of women holding elective and appointive 
offices has increased during the past two decades the gains have 
been incremental abzug said 
at the rate were going it will take 410 years to get equal 
numbers of men and women in the us congress she said we 
have allowed ourselves to lower our sights and lower our 
demands i believe we have to begin thinking in new ways 
abzug suggested asking both political parties to commit all open 
seats to women until equity is reached in the us house and 
pursuing the idea of having one of each states two us senators 
be a woman

seems to be giving of herself shes mesmerizing pulling the 
audience with her into the world of billie holidays songs

the verdict was actually a twopart ruling

skill ordinarily used by an attorney in such cases but the jury 
refused to assess any damages against mitchelson ruling that his 
failure had not injured his former client

sidestepping an array of 
stateofemergency bans the militant core of the antiapartheid 
movement is back on the offensive with a defiance campaign that has 
government leaders groping for a response 
crushing the campaign by force could wreck the governments 
ongoing initiatives to improve its international standing allowing 
unchecked civil disobedience could fuel widespread black activism 
and a white backlash against the governing national party in 
advance of parliamentary elections next month 
the campaign launched wednesday when about 270 blacks and 
indians sought and received treatment at segregated white 
hospitals is led by many of the activists who have been detained 
or restricted during the 3yearold state of emergency 
people have decided to take the matter into their own hands 
said essa moosa a lawyer involved in the campaign 
the campaigns leaders have designated themselves and their 
various organizations as the mass democratic movement a loose 
alliance which in effect takes the place of the united democratic 
front the udf was banned in february 1988 and by late last year 
activists were conceding that the emergency crackdown had seriously 
weakened their organizational prowess 
the first sign of a resurgence came in january when udf 
affiliates helped organize hunger strikes by hundreds of detained 
black activists faced with the prospect of detainees starving to 
death without ever being charged the government chose to free 
virtually all those held under emergency regulations 
now comes the defiance campaign which envisions the first 
sustained use of mass civil disobedience in south africa since the 
1950s its masterminds are activists who have proved their 
resilience and persistence 
two of the mass democratic movements key leaders are murphy 
morobe and mohammed valli moosa udf officials who escaped from 
detention to sanctuary at the us consulate last year the 
government allowed them to emerge without the restrictions imposed 
on many other udf leaders 
another key component of the new movement is the congress of 
south african trade unions the main black labor federation which 
has defied a government decree barring it from political activity 
the government may have trouble responding decisively to the 
defiance campaign because of a partial power vaccuum at the top 
president pw botha will retire after the sept 6 election and 
neither he nor his designated successor fw de klerk has been 
eager to make bold moves in recent weeks 
the governments point man in coping with the defiance campaign 
is law and order minister adriaan vlok he asserted last month the 
organizers sought to provoke violence and had endorsed handgrenade 
attacks on election candidates 
the mass democratic movement denied the allegations and mocked 
vlok after the hospital protest proceeded peacefully with minimal 
disruption to health services 
vlok belittled the protest as political pestering but said 
further acts of defiance are a timebomb that could explode at 
any moment 
health minister willie van niekerk complained that sick blacks 
had been used as pawns and said no hospitals elsewhere in the 
civilized world would be targeted by protesters antiapartheid 
leaders agreed saying no civilized countrys hospitals would be 
racially segregated 
the mass democratic movement says the defiance campaign will be 
extended soon to other targets possibly segregated schools and 
recreation facilities mineworkers have begun protesting workplace 
segregation and 17 former detainees in cape town said they would 
defy the restrictions imposed when they were freed 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper conceded in an 
editorial friday the activists scored a propaganda victory 
highlighting segregation at white hospitals issuing defiant 
statements and challenging the authorities without suffering any 
serious consequences 
the citizen said the government might regret its decision to 
avoid a preemptive crackdown on the protests organizers 
the governments dilemma has been aggravated by the fact that 
its current policy documents repudiate racial discrimination vlok 
himself declared during the week that apartheid is no longer the 
policy of the national party 
if vlok was speaking the truth said morobe then the defiance 
campaign would only be of help

congress passed and sent to president bush 
early saturday a landmark savings and loan bailout providing tens 
of billions of dollars to cover the losses of savers whose deposits 
disappeared in a wave of fraudulent lending 
by 201175 the house passed the 159 billion financial rescue 
the biggest in the nations history following a frantic 48 hours 
of negotiations between congress and the bush administration 
the senate approved the measure only two hours earlier giving 
president bush a victory on his first and biggest legislative 
initiative since taking office last january as congress recesses 
for a month bush had agreed in advance to the compromise the 
second in as many days 
the bill provides 50 billion over the next three years to close 
and merge 500 insolvent sampls and pay off savers whose billions of 
dollars in government insured deposits were lost to failed and 
often fraudulent loans most of them in texas 
it also totally overhauls the regulation of the industry to try 
to fulfill bushs promise that never again will taxpayers be 
asked to pay for losses sampl owners will be required to put 
billions of dollars more of their own money at risk as a buffer 
between risky loans and the federal deposit insurance funds 
the administration lobbied house republicans throughout the day 
to provide the winning margin as democrats defected from the bill 
in large numbers in response to a compromise hiding most of the 
cleanup costs off the budget and out of the official federal 
deficit 
republicans in the house supported the bill 11940 while 
democrats opposed it 13582 fiftyone members did not vote and 
five voted present 
rep sam gibbons dfla accused house members of losing their 
conscience and their backbone in bowing to a veto threat from bush 
and agreeing to financing the bulk of the bailouts costs through 
30year bonds 
it should have been paid for by taxes but the president could 
not bring himself to say the word said gibbons so we have 
fostered this unconscionable debt on our children and 
grandchildren 
but with the losses of federally insured deposits mounting at a 
rate of 20 million to 30 million a day supporters said it would 
be equally unconscionable for congress to go on vacation without 
fixing the problem 
i for one dont want to take the chance of another 
bankholiday crisis said rep chalmers wylie rohio referring 
to the wave of bank closings at the end of the hoover 
administration in early 1933 that deepened the great depression 
the alternative are unthinkable added rep steve bartlett 
rtexas 
the savings of million of americans are at stake unless we do 
something sen christopher bond dmo said just before the 
unusual divison vote in which supporters and opponents indicate 
their position by standing 
the procedure leaves no record of who votes yes or no but four 
senators stood in opposition and three others asked to be recorded 
as opponents they were sens bob graham dfla kent conrad 
dnd charles grassley riowa james exon dneb wendell ford 
dky john warner rva and jay rockefeller rwva 
i think it is the best bill possible to craft under the 
circumstances said sen donald riegle jr chairman of the 
senate banking committee it will make major reforms in every 
area 
president bush was on the phone with house members from both 
parties throughout the day according to sources pleading for 
support and treasury secretary nicholas f brady was dispatched to 
the capitol hill to negotiate a resolve to the impasse 
brady a former appointed republican senator from new jersey 
spent nearly an hour on the senate floor lobbying former colleagues 
senate majority leader george mitchell took the bill the senate 
floor only after brady and rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
the house energy and commerce committee reached an accord on 
offbudget bonds 
dingell had demanded that the offbudget bonds to be used for 
much of the financing be registered with the securities and 
exchange commission as carrying a risk higher than normal 
government securities he and brady agreed that the sec may demand 
full disclosure to investors of risks but the bill does not require 
registration 
dingell earlier friday joined with three other committee 
chairmen to oppose the thursday accord reps dan rostenkowski 
dill leon panetta dcalif and john conyers dmich dingell 
leads the energy and commerce committee rostenskowski chairs ways 
and means panetta is in charge of budget and conyers heads 
government operations

the crowd of people seeking favors from former 
housing secretary samuel pierce jr included his successor and one 
of his most vocal critics in congress according to reports 
published friday 
fourdozen boxes of documents from pierces eightyear tenure at 
the department of housing and urban development contained mounds of 
requests for his time or help the reports said 
the washington post the new york times and the wall street 
journal citing documents obtained under the freedom of information 
act report that pierce became involved in selected cases at the 
behest of political associates 
in testimony before a congressional subcommittee in may pierce 
said he didnt do special favors for consultants or developers and 
had merely instructed subordinates to give personal requests 
careful consideration 
among the documents released to the newspapers were numerous 
letters asking pierce for help or thanking him for the departments 
approval of one project or another the reports did not specify in 
every case whether pierce himself interceded on behalf of those who 
sought his help 
according to the journal among those who wrote pierce were jack 
kemp the current hud secretary who at the time was a congressman 
from new york former defense secretary caspar weinberger sen 
strom thurmond rsc and rep barney frank a massachusetts 
democrat who has been one of the most outspoken critics in congress 
of the influence peddling that existed at hud during pierces 
tenure 
in its saturday editions the times said the documents also 
showed hud officials withheld from congress records that showed the 
extent of political favoritism in the award of federal subsidies 
for lowincome housing 
sen john heinz rpa asked hud in early 1988 for two years of 
records on the awarding of the subsidies the documents show heinz 
was given data only for a fourmonth period after the program had 
been revised to curb political abuses the times said 
the newspapers quoted a letter from james watt in which the 
former interior secretary thanked pierce for his support of a 
suburban baltimore housing project that was awarded 28 million in 
section 8 moderate rehabilitation funds in may 1986 
watt was paid 300000 by the developer of the project to help 
obtain money from housing and urban development and according to 
previous testimony had met with pierce to discuss the project 
thanks watt wrote to pierce on june 6 1986 you are a 
man of your word 
asked for comment by the times watt referred to his 
congressional testimony last spring in which he said his contacts 
with pierce were proper 
pierce faces no charges of wrongdoing but congressional 
investigators have questioned the truthfulness of some of his 
testimony the post said pierce could not be reached for comment

a judge has issued a succinct order to the 
creators of a parody of cliffs notes the yellowandblack 
booklets that have aided generations of struggling students by 
condensing hemingway shakespeare and milton 
change it 
us district judge shirley wohl kram ruled this week that the 
upcoming satire looks too much like the real thing and that the 
parodists cannot use any cover that might be confused with cliffs 
notes 
the decision was described as unprecedented by kathy trager 
lawyer for the parodys publisher doubleday she moved to seek an 
expedited appeal of the ruling as well as an immediate stay 
if this ruling is upheld it will deal a significant blow to 
free speech and first amendment liberties and will endanger the 
viability of parody as a literary form said nancy evans 
president and publisher of doubleday 
ms trager said that although the judge did not enjoin the 
production of any parody her restrictions on the cover meant 
exactly that recreating the appearance of the subject is the 
essence of parody she said and a parody of cliffs notes 
without a yellowandblack cover would be like a parody of time 
magazine without a red border up front 
the satire spy notes was produced by the editors of spy 
magazine a brash new york humor monthly and was to reach 
bookstore shelves next month 
it ridicules and boils down trendy best sellers like bright 
lights big city slaves of new york and less than zero 
like this on less than zero clay meets trent and rip at a 
nightclub called the roxy ross takes them all to see a dead body 
in an alleyway then they all go to rips house where there is a 
delirious naked 12yearold girl tied to a bed 
it also offers questions for review biographical notes 
and suggestions for further reading mostly a listing of 
gossipcolumn appearances of authors bret easton ellis jay 
mcinerney and tama janowitz 
the cover is yellow with black stripes and the titles of the 
summarized works are in the same block letters used on cliffs 
notes covers but instead of the mountain depicted in the lower 
right corner of real cliffs notes spy notes features a manhattan 
skyline 
in addition the words a satire are printed nine times in 
pink letters on the spy notes cover 
after cliffs notes inc learned of spys plans the company 
went to court to seek an injunction against the parodys cover 
cliffs claimed the parody was a trademark violation which would 
confuse the public 
the companys product has been used by generations of college 
and high school students who either failed to read assigned works 
or failed to understand them in its complaint cliffs notes noted 
the excellence of its literary works gave it an outstanding 
reputation and acceptance among members of the public throughout 
the united states 
the judge said she disagreed with doubledays theory that the 
first amendment gives the parodist unbridled freedom to use a 
registered trademark as part of a parody or satire 
she found that the spy notes cover design and cliffs notes 
trademark cover are similar to a degree that would cause consumer 
confusion 
consumers could believe that cliffs was satirizing spy that 
spy was a division of cliffs or that cliffs licensed spy she 
said 
the judge agreed with cliffs that spy notes goes far beyond 
conjuring up the cliffs notes image and instead merely copies 
it with minor differences added in an attempt to avoid trademark 
violations 
william m hart lawyer for cliffs said his client is as 
much entitled to the first amendment protection as doubleday is it 
would be a perverse injustice if someone in the name of the first 
amendment was able to take a trademarked cover design and be immune 
from liability 
kurt andersen coeditor of spy said the judges ruling defied 
understanding its a shocking and puzzling decision he 
said i dont see how anyone could possibly confuse the two

abbott laboratories is marketing a new test that 
detects the aids virus rather than the bodys response to the virus 
and can reveal infection weeks earlier than currently used tests 
the company said friday 
aidsvirus tests now in use detect the presence of antibodies 
proteins manufactured by white blood cells to fight invading 
organisms antibodies usually appear in a persons system six to 10 
weeks after infection 
the new test detects aids antigens proteins on the surface of 
the invading virus the new test can signal the presence of the 
antigens about two weeks after infection a spokesman for the north 
chicagobased company said 
this test complements the antibody test it does not replace 
the antibody test said dr harold kessler associate professor 
of medicine and director of the hiv treatment program at 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center 
test was approved thursday for commercial sale by the us food 
and drug administration making it the only approved test for the 
aids virus in the country 
though antigens are the first detectable sign of infection they 
effectively disappear with the appearance of antibodies which 
remain in the body the antigen test is thus not always able to 
reveal the presence of infection 
antigens only reappear when the virus becomes more active a 
possible signal that the infected person will get sick either with 
immune problems with a mild form of aids known as aidsrelated 
complex or with fullblown aids said kessler 
to identify which infected people are likely to develop symptoms 
some may be infected for years without any symptoms doctors can 
check patients with the new test every three or four months said 
abbott spokesman charles weber 
if you come up where the antigen test is positive that might 
be the opportune moment to intervene with azt or some form of 
antiviral therapy weber said azt or zidovudine is the only 
drug approved by the fda for fighting aids 
kessler said antigenpositive patients have a 75 percent chance 
of developing symptoms compared with 29 percent for 
antigennegative patients 
the new test available under the trade name hiv ag1 is 
already under manufacture because is has previously been used to 
monitor the effectiveness of azt it will continue to be valuable 
for that purpose kessler said 
kessler said the test will probably cost 100 to 120 at the 
lab which is not out of line with other laboratory tests for 
viruses

congress approved an historic savings and loan 
rescue plan early saturday after the democraticcontrolled house 
overwhelmingly approved a 2865 billion military spending bill 
ignoring president bushs veto threat 
in the rush to complete its work before a monthlong recess the 
senate passed the compromise 159 billion savings and loan bailout 
plan and sent it to the house the sampl vote in the senate on 
president bushs first and biggest legislative initiative was 
anticlimactic without even a roll call a sharply divided house 
passed the bill 201175 just moments after midnight 
at the outset of its more than 15hour lawmaking marathon the 
house voted 312105 to adopt military appropriations legislation 
the measure would cut 18 billion from star wars strictly curtail 
production of the b2 bomber and eliminate all funds for the 
midgetman nuclear missile the advanced tactical fighter and cruise 
missile president bush has threatened to veto the bill 
the senate also passed legislation on financial liability for 
oil spills aid to farmers hit by the drought and a temporary 70 
billion extension to the 28 trillion federal debt limit which 
the house had approved earlier 
while congress pushed for speedy action on a series of bills 
bush complained to senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
about senate delays on 120 of his appointments 
the president wanted to register his deep concern that these 
were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the 
candidates themselves presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters at the white house 
the artificial reasons according to administration 
officials and senate minority leader bob dole rkan are party 
politics 
among the nominations the senate has not yet acted on are bushs 
selection of donald gregg who has been linked to the irancontra 
affair as ambassador to south korea and several nominees to the 
scandalplagued department of housing and urban development 
away from the legislative action and white house complaints the 
house ethics committee said it had decided to investigate three 
lawmakers accused of sexual improprieties 
the committee voted in secret session thursday to conduct 
preliminary inquiries into the conduct of reps gus savage dill 
donald e buz lukens rohio and jim bates dcalif 
lukens was convicted in ohio on a misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the unruliness of a child he was sentenced june 30 
to 180 days in jail and fined 1000 for having sex with a teenage 
girl 
two former aides to bates have filed a complaint alleging he 
sexually harassed female members of his staff three democrats 
filed a complaint against savage after news reports said a peace 
corps volunteer complained the congressman fondled her while he was 
traveling in zaire 
sen david durenberger dminn disclosed that the senate 
ethics committee has completed a preliminary inquiry of his 
previously disclosed book contract that an opponent claimed was a 
device to circumvent limits on fee income the senator said the 
committee had decided to proceed with its investigation 
the last major legislative battle before the recess concerned 
the thrift bailout 
a tenuous compromise with the bush administration agreed to 
late thursday night was threatened as key house democrats 
announced opposition in particular they objected to financing 
provisions that would keep much of the cost of the bailout outs they 
said add 
substantially to the overall expense to be borne by taxpayers 
with savings and loan losses mounting at a rate of 20 million 
or more a day bush wrote to the lawmakers final passage remains 
critical to the stability and solvency of the financial system 
the landmark bill would close or merge hundreds of insolvent 
savings institutions 
setting the stage for the difficult task of deciding the sampl 
bailout the house moved quickly on the defense appropriations bill 
that largely conformed to the military authorization plan passed by 
the chamber last week 
despite word from the white house budget office that the 
presidents senior advisers would recommend a veto and a similar 
assessment from the ranking republican on the house armed services 
committee the chamber gave overwhelming approval to the plan 
in fact the vote for the appropriations plan 312105 
amounted to a stronger statement than the 261162 approval of the 
authorization bill 
they have conformed rep william dickinson of alabama 
ranking gop member on armed services said of the two pieces of 
legislation but that still makes it vetobait in my opinion 
dickinson said he hoped that when members of the senate and 
house meet early in september to craft a final version of the bill 
the most egregious addons and deletions can be modified and 
limited to make it acceptable to the administration 
among the other finalday action taken by congress 
the senate voted 990 to increase industrys financial 
liability for oil spills create a nationwide system to clean up 
such accidents and establish a 1 billion trust fund to help 
compensate for damages the vote came less than five months after 
the tanker exxon valdez struck a reef in alaskas prince william 
sound spilling 11 million gallons of oil 
the house and senate approved a compromise plan providing 895 
million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the drought 
and other weatherrelated problems bush administration officials 
have indicated that the president will sign the legislation

a 31 million judgment won by the widow of 
an air force pilot killed in an f16 jet crash in south korea more 
than six years ago has been overturned by a threejudge federal 
appeals court panel 
the widow janet harduvel of lutz can petition the full 11th 
us circuit court of appeals to reconsider the case if the 
request is refused she has said she plans to appeal to the us 
supreme court 
retired us supreme court justice lewis powell served on the 
appellate panel and wrote its opinion released monday 
the judgment was rendered by a us district court jury in april 
1987 against general dynamics the f16 fighter jet contractor on 
the grounds that the plane was defectively designed and 
manufactured 
mrs harduvels attorney howard acosta told the appeals panel 
the plane had a severe electrical malfunction causing the crash 
into a mountain that killed capt ed harduvel in november 1982 
mark dumbroff a washington dcbased attorney representing 
general dynamics asked for a reversal contending the crash was a 
result of pilot error 
the panel rejected the argument that there were defects in the 
designing and building of the air forces newest jet fighter and 
overturned the lower court verdict

a psychologist intends to appeal a federal 
court ruling that allows a journalist quoting a public figure to 
make up a quote if the quote does not alter the substantive 
content of what was said 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled on friday that 
jeffrey masson a former director of the freud archives could not 
sue writer janet malcolm for 102 million over a new yorker 
magazine article and book that allegedly quoted him as saying many 
things he never said 
the purported quotes included massons selfdescription as an 
intellectual gigolo his comment that after sigmund freud he 
would be regarded as the greatest analyst who ever lived and a 
statement that he would have turned the freud house into a place 
of sex women fun 
in a libel suit by a public figure who must prove that harmful 
statements were deliberately or recklessly false quotations can be 
fabricated if they are rational interpretations of ambiguous 
remarks or do not alter the substantive content of unambiguous 
remarks said the opinion by judge arthur alarcon he was joined 
in his opinion by judge cynthia holcomb hall 
but the dissenter in the 21 decision judge alex kozinski said 
fabricated quotes were the equivalent of lies 
if authors are given license to invent quotations on the basis 
of what they perceive to be a speakers character there are no 
words whatsoever that they cannot put into a subjects mouth 
kozinski said 
karl olson lawyer for malcolm and her publishers said the 
ruling vindicates his clients he said they never conceded that any 
quotes had been made up or changed other than a word here and a 
word there 
paul kleven a lawyer for masson said the ruling would be 
appealed 
we dont think theres any need to allow that sort of 
alteration to protect the values that the first amendment is 
designed to protect he said 
masson a berkeley resident was fired in 1981 as director of 
the new yorkbased freud archives 
he said he was fired and fell out of favor among psychoanalysts 
because he had written that freud the father of modern 
pscyhoanalysis knew the evidence was to the contrary when he 
declared that women usually fantasized claims of childhood sexual 
abuse 
his suit attacked malcolms 1983 new yorker article trouble 
in the archives and her 1984 book in the freud archives on 
the struggle between masson and directors of the archives over his 
views on freud 
masson said malcolm had maliciously painted a false picture of 
him by fabricating quotes citing numerous statements that were not 
in her taperecorded interviews he also said he notified the new 
yorker and the book publisher of the fabrications before 
publication 
us district judge eugene lynch dismissed the suit in 1987 an 
appeals court upheld his ruling 
kozinski in his dissent said the quotes distorted massons 
taped statements for example he never called himself the greatest 
analyst just the only one who held his views in addition 
kozinski said journalists are supposed to vouch for the accuracy 
of the quotes they use 
he also quoted william shawn editor of the new yorker at the 
time of malcolms articles as calling the magazine the most 
accurate publication not only in this country but in the entire 
world

one of the most vociferous revealing and at the same time very 
ugly events this week took place in lebanon this can reveal the 
face of the hegemonistic powers of the world 
see how ugly the issue is 
a country by the name of israel which is from the root up an 
usurper officially enters a town with military forces with a 
helicopter and takes the friday prayer leader of the town along 
with two of his security men 
this is not at all acceptable by any international standard and 
no country can say this is right no international law can condone 
this action 
a country cannot enter another country kidnap and leave and 
then confess to it 
ok it used to do this and not confess it would deny it 
this wasnt boastfulness it was a crime but not boasting 
but it confessed it announced this is to make a laughingstock 
of all those individuals who adhere by international laws 
what happened in return 
some innocent people whose identity isnt even known a number 
of unknown people combating covertly announced that a person they 
had been keeping as a spy had been killed they hanged him in 
revenge their reason was that israel is americas agent and we 
will take our revenge on this american person whom we have captive 
and who is implicated in israels crime in return for mr sheik 
abdul karim obeid this was what they said 
then they threatened that they would kill the rest of the 
hostages too if you dont free obeid 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
so what should we do in this situation 
here there is one clear point and a somber point 
the clear point is that a government has officially confessed 
confessed to all about its crime 
the somber point is that a group has killed someone who may be 
innocent but we dont know therefore we will not make any 
judgment on this we dont even know who he is and so we dont 
make any judgment 
and we dont know this group either whether they are righteous 
people or not who they are we only know only that the people of 
lebanon are innocent people and innocent people cannot be 
condemned without reason 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
global arrogance the united states if it wanted to do 
something it would have been clear 
it should take israel by the collar and say free sheik obeid so 
that the issue is finished 
if you take a criminal and ask him to stop his crimes this is 
popular in the world 
they might say no this doesnt concern us and we are no 
match for israel this is not acceptable to us no one accepts 
this israel itself does not accept this the people of america 
dont accept this if america really wants to stop israel it must 
announce it must say until sheik obeid is freed american aid 
will be stopped 
this congress that convenes in america these bigwigs that sit 
and vote there this is the way you should vote 
why do you think so crookedly and speak so arrogantly instead 
of going after a selfconfessed known boastful criminal you 
order that your warships gather from around the world toward 
innocent lebanon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what kind of idiots are you 
see how ugly the world is see how the idiotic are the 
politicians who rule the world 
if they want to solve the problems of lebanon there are ways 
the ways are clear they dont want to solve the problems they are 
not prepared to stop backing maronite rule in lebanon 
they are still hoping waiting for the day to have a maronite 
israel in lebanon one jewish israel in palestine one maronite 
israel in lebanon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i state i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has 
solutions the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable 
prudent solutions 
these bullyings arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve 
the problems come let us enter reasonably we too will help solve 
the problems there so the people of the region can live in peace 
and harmony

the bush administration is in a holding 
pattern as it pins its hopes on continued diplomatic efforts to 
resolve the crisis involving hostages held by moslem extremists an 
official said 
the administration on friday voiced optimism tinged with 
caution at the promise of irans new president hashemi 
rafsanjani to help find a solution to the hostage situation 
president bush said he would explore the overture to the 
fullest 
i dont want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment but theres 
reason to be somewhat encouraged bush said about rafsanjanis 
comments 
still presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united 
states is always skeptical of what we hear from iran while 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler sounded a slightly 
more positive reaction 
based on the excerpts we have seen president rafsanjanis 
remarks appear to be moderate and are therefore encouraging she 
said we have reason to believe that iran is genuinely engaged 
and no reason to believe that its engagement is not focused in a 
positive direction 
the united states which does not have direct relations with 
iran was using switzerland as an intermediary to seek help from 
iran generally believed to wield influence with the shiite 
kidnappers officials said 
the president also called the head of the genevabased 
international red cross cornelio sommaruga on friday to voice 
support for the agencys involvement in trying to free the 
hostages said fitzwater 
efforts by the red cross were alluded to by rafsanjani when he 
said he would help the united states find solutions 
bush spoke of a very extraordinarily broad exercise of 
diplomacy here in the last couple of days during which aides said 
he has appealed to dozens of world leaders for help 
the diplomatic efforts are continuing fitzwater said 
another administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said its in a holding pattern while the 
administration watches for its diplomatic overtures to produce 
results no new messages went to iran on friday the official said 
during a photo session bush was asked about the massing of us 
naval strength in the mediterranean sea and the indian ocean as a 
possible indicator he had decided to retaliate militarily if 
another us hostage was killed 
if i had made such a decision i expect this would be the last 
place id be talking about it bush said 
but fitzwater denied bush had selected specific lebanese targets 
to hit if kidnappers had carried out a threat to kill american 
hostage joseph cicippio 
i will say he did not make final decisions fitzwater said 
it does not help the united states government or the united 
states to be discussing military tactics to be flexing our 
muscles in public 
bush was he was certainly pleased that the kidnappers on 
thursday indefinitely suspended their death threat against cicippio 
im encouraged but i dont want to get the hopes of the 
hostages loved ones up once again to have those hopes dashed 
this is a brutal process where you see people paraded before 
cameras and their families get their hopes up the president said

congress capped a prevacation flurry of 
fiscal action by giving final approval of a bailout for the savings 
and loan industry early today and by granting president bushs 
request for an increase in the national debt limit 
after weeks of intense wrangling and a lastminute legislative 
showdown the senate approved the sampl bill without a roll call 
shortly after midnight the house then sent the package to bush on 
a narrow 201175 vote with most of the chambers ruling democrats 
voting against 
bush is expected to sign the 1000page legislation which would 
overhaul the thrift industry 
one of the biggest hangups on the sampl bill was its impact on the 
federal deficit and bushs plan to keep the 159 billion cost 
offbudget bush won a compromise from the 
democraticcontrolled congress by threatening a veto 
the senate also gave voice vote approval and sent to bush a bill 
temporarily adding 70 billion in new borrowing authority to the 
treasurys current credit limit of 28 trillion 
the interim debt bill which would expire oct 31 was approved 
earlier in the week by the house the bill is needed because a 
permanent debt ceiling increase to more than 3 trillion has bogged 
down in the senate and without more borrowing authority the 
government would default on its obligations this month 
the permanent debt bill is expected to become a legislative 
vehicle for a variety of amendments in the senate after congress 
returns next month for its fall meeting 
earlier friday the house ignored threats of a possible veto and 
passed a 2865 billion military spending bill that would slash 
billions of dollars from bushs strategic weapons programs 
the bill approved 312105 would cut 18 billion from star 
wars strictly curtail production of the b2 bomber and eliminate 
all funds for the midgetman nuclear missile the advanced tactical 
fighter and cruise missile 
also friday 
the senate approved an 184 billion spending bill for fiscal 
1989 operations of the treasury postal service and other 
government agencies 
the bill was approved only after a controversial amendment to 
restore oliver norths military pension was put off until the fall 
when it will be taken up as a separate bill 
among the items in the spending bill is 200000 to remodel the 
vice president dan quayles official residence to better 
accommodate his young family 
the measure contains 55 billion for the internal revenue 
service 300 million more than this year and 13 billion for the 
customs service 100 million above 1989 spending 
it also aims to prevent credit card companies from joining with 
charities to seek business and thus taking advantage of subsidized 
mail rates 
another part of the bill would suspend for one year enforcement 
of a tax law designed to encourage companies to give health 
insurance to lowlevel workers business groups have complained 
that the requirement is expensive and timeconsuming 
the house ethics committee announced it will conduct 
preliminary inquiries into the conduct of reps gus savage dill 
donald e buz lukens rohio and jim bates dcalif 
lukens was convicted in ohio on a misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the unruliness of a child for having sex with a 
teenage girl 
two former aides to bates have filed a complaint alleging he 
sexually harassed female members of his staff 
three democrats filed a complaint against savage after news 
reports said a peace corps volunteer complained the congressman 
fondled her while he was traveling in zaire 
sen david durenberger dminn said the senate ethics 
committee has decided to proceed with its investigation of his book 
contract that an opponent claimed was used to circumvent limits on 
outside income 
the senate in a bill reacting to the exxon valdez disaster 
voted 990 to increase industrys financial liability for oil 
spills create a nationwide system to clean up such accidents and 
establish a 1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages 
the house and senate approved and sent to bush a bill providing 
895 million to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the 
drought and other weatherrelated problems

a group of adoptees birth mothers and 
adoptive parents say their rally at the lincoln memorial is part of 
an effort to seek the unsealing of confidential birth records 
the 40 participants concluded a 2week march from new york to 
washington on friday and launched a twoday public awareness 
campaign that will include the rally today at the lincoln memorial 
the group picketed friday in front of the citys office of vital 
records while five members went inside to request original birth 
certificates 
the five including two adoptees and three women who had given 
up children they bore in the district of columbia when they were 
teenagers were turned down by registrar jack crandall 
i have the old nothing answer i guess because its the 
law crandall an adoptive father himself told the group the 
law says that when a person is adopted we create a new birth 
certificate and the old certificate is under seal and can only be 
opened by order of the court 
similar efforts to obtain birth records had failed in new york 
philadelphia and baltimore earlier in the march 
the president of another adoption group objected to the 
marchers efforts to have records unsealed 
people have a right to be left alone said william pierce 
president of the national committee for adoption which represents 
141 adoption agencies and 2000 individuals the courts have said 
rather clearly that a persons right to privacy is greater than 
the right to the information 
he pointed out that many birth mothers dont want to be found 
but adoption congress president kate burke insisted adoptees would 
not abuse an open record system by disrupting the lives of birth 
mothers 
if a birth mother doesnt want to be found all she has to say 
is i dont want a relationship when her child contacts her 
said burke 
pierce said he favors a mutual consent arrangement in effect in 
22 states which allows birth mothers and their adult children to 
meet if both register to express that desire he called mutual 
consent a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to get 
together if they both want to 
if most of them do have a burning desire to meet then most of 
them will voluntarily register pierce said 
ten states use a system that allows an adult adoptee to request 
a search for his or her mother and then meet her if she consents 
said pierce three states alaska alabama and kansas open 
records once an adoptee reaches age 18 the remainder of the states 
have sealed records

zipping back and forth in front of the 
capitol the kneehigh vehicle looked like a space age toy 
but senators who celebrated the completion of the nofuel 
crosscountry journey of the prototype solarpowered vehicle are 
taking james wordens creation seriously 
this really is the wave of the future said sen john f 
kerry dmass calling it one of the most exciting things we 
could witness 
with bemused tourists looking on threewheeled vehicle was 
inspected on the capitol lawn friday by lawmakers who hope 
solardriven cars can eventually replace gasburning autos 
sen tim wirth dcolo pondering the possibilities of 
pollutionfree solar cars said traditional automobiles produce 
their weight in carbon each year emissions that add to air 
pollution and global warming 
the 3200mile trip from los angeles to washington via the south 
was made in two weeks setting a new world distance record for 
solar cars 
worden 22 the cars chief designer and one of four drivers 
said his group is working on two solar powered cars an economy 
model that would sell for about 12000 and a sports model for 
20000 they would look much more like traditional autos he said 
worden hopes to have the cars in semimass production within 
two years 
our message is everyone can drive to work and back in a 
solar car said worden a 1989 graduate of the massachusetts 
institute of technology who built his first solarpowered car while 
in high school 
the 270pound solectria has a singleseat cockpit styled 
like the inside of a racing car with the drivers legs extending 
straight forward and a tiny steering wheel an 11foot by 6foot 
rectangular solar panel sits flat atop the body with a small 
bubble in the middle for the driver 
its actually comfortable said the 6foot 4inch kerry 
looking decidedly uncomfortable as he sat in the car 
the vehicle is powered by a small electric motor that can get 
the car up to 90 mph 
wordens prototype clearly has limitations he could not get 
the vehicle to get over a curb to get to the site of the news 
conference but it has responsive turning and fast pick up the 
designer raced around the capitol parking lot at speeds that 
ordinarily would bring a warning from security guards 
worden wearing a white racing jumpsuit and flashing a thumbs up 
sign said the team had few troubles other than a couple of flats 
in louisiana but the traditional gaspowered truck that brought 
the solar car from massachusetts to california broke down

congress would be making a mistake by 
following west virginias lead and barring high school dropouts 
from driving said the lawyer for the teenager who failed in his 
challenge of the state law 
kanawha county circuit judge paul zakaib upheld the law friday 
saying the government has a compelling interest in keeping children 
in class 
the case involved an appeal filed by 17yearold michael means 
who lost his license when he dropped out shortly after his 16th 
birthday 
the law has drawn national attention and on thursday an 
illinois congressman introduced a bill for a similar nationwide 
statute 
means lawyer christopher butch said that would be a mistake 
butch said innercity youths often dont have access to cars and 
wont care if their drivers licenses are taken away 
white suburban kids will go back to school so they can have 
the car on saturday night and go cruising he said kids in the 
innercity are going to have no reason to stay in school because 
they can use the lexington avenue subway 
means whose 16yearold wife is expecting their first child 
this month lives on the outskirts of charleston and says he cant 
get a job to support his family without driving privileges he 
overslept butch said and did not attend fridays hearing 
means does not have a home telephone and messages left with his 
family werent returned 
in his ruling zakaib said means was not denied due process 
because he was granted a hearing by the state department of motor 
vehicles before his license was suspended 
he also ruled that means failed to prove he was forced to drop 
out of school by circumstances beyond his control an exemption 
provided by the state law 
noting that 40 percent of the states residents have an 
eighthgrade education or less zakaib said the law is a legitimate 
way for the state to persuade students to stay in school 
the failure to graduate or complete a secondary education not 
only adversely affects the juvenile it affects the society as a 
whole zakaib said 
assistant attorney general bruce walker who represented the 
state at fridays hearing said 400 dropouts whose licenses were 
suspended because of the new law returned to school last year 
the state normally has 5000 dropouts each school year but in 
198889 the number was just 3400 to 3500 walker said 
this ruling establishes that driving is a conditional 
privilege and not a basic right said attorney general charlie 
brown further this law acts as a positive tool in building a 
solid foundation for a prosperous and more educated generation

if puerto rico becomes a state federal 
spending for some social welfare programs could rise a 
congressional study says 
the study released friday by sen daniel p moynihan dny 
who requested it looked at the effects of a proposal for a 
referendum on the status of puerto rico currently before congress 
the congressional research report analyzed what would happen to 
some social welfare programs if puerto rico were to become a state 
be granted independence or receive enhanced commonwealth 
status under which federal grantinaid programs could be 
consolidated and streamlined 
for example replacing puerto ricos program of aid to the aged 
blind or disabled with the supplemental security income program 
would significantly expand the eligible population increasing 
benefits by as much as tenfold said the report 
the study didnt make definitive cost or budget estimates but 
looked at the general implications of the alternatives 
demographically puerto rico is younger poorer and suffers 
higher unemployment than any of the 50 states the study noted 
the programs that would have the greatest impact if extended to 
puerto rico as a state are food stamps supplemental security 
income and the earned income tax credit for which benefits are 
nationally uniform and not set by the states the study found 
currently ssi is not available in puerto rico the program 
which is administered by the social security administration 
guarantees a minimum level of cash income to the needy blind aged 
and disabled instead puerto rico operates an assistance program 
of aid to such people although disability payments are restricted 
to those age 18 or older 
the us government pays 75 percent of puerto ricos assistance 
payments to the aged blind or disabled up to a specified limit 
the report says in fiscal 1987 puerto rico qualified for a 
maximum of 129 million in matching funds according to the study 
but if puerto rico were treated like the states ssi would 
replace the current system providing much larger benefits but 
setting much higher eligibility limits the report says 
furthermore ssi would cover disabled children not currently 
included 
if puerto rico became a state the federal food stamp program 
would replace its nutrition assistance program under which 
eligible people receive cash benefits 
all benefits would have to be issued in coupons and while it is 
not clear what the levels would be they would be higher than in 
the rest of the country according to the report

the bush administration is embracing a nearly 
900 million package of federal disaster aid for farmers passed by 
congress to cover crop losses this year from severe weather 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter indicated friday the 
president would sign the legislation and he vowed to implement the 
relief program as promptly and fairly as we possibly can 
passage of the measure by the house and senate ended weeks of 
uncertainty for farmstate lawmakers who worried they would have 
to return home emptyhanded for a monthlong recess now they can 
assure farmers that federal relief checks will be available to 
cover expenses for the fall planting season 
when our farmers suffer catastrophic loss whether its due to 
drought flood or other disastrous weather we must keep our pact 
with those who work the land sen patrick leahy dvt chairman 
of the agriculture committee said before the senate approved the 
measure on a voice vote and forwarded it to the white house 
the house passed the bill earlier in the day without a recorded 
vote 
in general farmers can qualify for federal payments if they 
suffer crop losses from 35 percent to 50 percent because of 
weatherrelated disasters the measure also offers payments to 
livestock producers facing droughtrelated feed and water shortages 
for their herds 
key eligibility and payment provisions in the assistance package 
are identical to legislation approved wednesday by the senate the 
bill is projected to cost about 895 million 
it seems to me that the final outcome is about as sound as 
could have been expected under the circumstances said yeutter 
the legislation is aimed primarily at farmers in portions of the 
great plains and western corn belt which have not recovered from 
the drought of 1988 and in the south where flooding has destroyed 
rice and cotton 
the bill has different eligibility standards for various crops 
but in all cases producers would receive payments designed to 
cover 65 percent of their lost income from crop losses 
in most instances the projected income levels will be based on 
federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have 
received had they not suffered losses 
lawmakers intend to pay for the relief package with savings from 
commodity subsidy programs which are costing less because of 
higher market prices this year from weathershrunken harvests 
last year congress approved 39 billion in assistance for 
farmers hurt by drought supporters of this years legislation said 
continued severe weather required another relief package but they 
pledged to improve the federal crop insurance program to alleviate 
the need for agricultural disaster aid in the future

responding to the exxon valdez oil spill the 
senate has passed environmentalprotection legislation hailed by 
majority leader george mitchell as reducing the potential for 
damage to our nation 
the measure boosts companies liability for oil spills creates 
a nationwide system to clean them up and establishes a 1 billion 
trust fund to help compensate for damages similar legislation is 
pending in the house 
such legislation had been under consideration for years but the 
issue took on a new sense of urgency after the tanker struck bligh 
reef in alaskas prince william sound rupturing the ships hull 
and spilling 11 million gallons of oil that stained the coastline 
added impetus came from two smallerscale spills over a 24hour 
period off rhode island in the delaware river and in the houston 
ship channel 
the purpose of this bill is to make sure that we never again 
allow an oil spill to become an ecological disaster said sen 
max baucus dmont the bills floor manager 
this legislation when enacted into law will discourage such 
oil spills in the future and reduce the potential for damage to our 
nation said mitchell dmaine who worked for passage of 
oilspill legislation for eight years 
and if they do occur they will be cleaned up and compensated 
much more readily than has been the case he said 
the bill was approved 990 with sen david durenberger 
rminn not voting 
the legislation directs that contingency plans be drawn for 
dealing with oil spills on land and water and requires the 
establishment of cleanup teams with preplaced equipment 
the 1 billion trust fund will be financed by a 3centabarrel 
fee or tax on all domestic and imported petroleum 
the bill provides for increasing the limit of compensation for 
each oil spill from 500 million to 1 billion 
in alaska gov steve cowper praised the action 
this bill is a major step forward for alaska and all other 
coastal states whose residents face enormous economic 
environmental and human damage from oil spills cowper said in 
fairbanks this bill wont end the suffering but it will make 
major spills less likely and the response to them quicker and 
better 
in acting on a series of amendments the senate sharply raised 
an owners liability for compensating for oil spills and their 
destruction of property and the environment 
the legislation preserves the authority of the states to impose 
unlimited liability if they wish and to impose their own oil spill 
standards and requirements set up cleanup or compensation funds 
and levy fees and penalties 
it also gives the president extensive authority to take overall 
charge of cleanup efforts including issuing orders to owners

education minister toshiki kaifu and two veteran 
politicians from the ruling party today applied to run in next 
weeks election to choose the third prime minister in japan this 
year 
scandals involving bribery and sex have forced noboru takeshita 
and his successor sousuke uno from office prematurely 
while the 58yearold kaifu remains the frontrunner some party 
leaders complained that he had been selected in backroom factional 
manuevers offended by those wanting reform pledges two party 
veterans announced at the last minute friday that they would 
challenge kaifu 
all three put in nomination papers shortly before the deadline 
this morning at the headquarters of the governing liberal 
democratic party which holds a secret ballot tuesday to elect a 
successor to prime minister uno 
uno took office june 2 replacing takeshita who resigned as an 
influencepeddling scandal sent the partys popularity skidding to 
record lows in opinion polls uno became the target of allegations 
he kept paid mistresses and he decided to step down after the 
party lost in july voting for half the seats in the upper house of 
parliament 
the other candidates are yoshiro hayashi 62 a former welfare 
minister and extransportation minister shintaro ishihara 56 who 
comes from the strongly nationalist wing of the party 
whoever is elected to head the party is assured the prime 
ministership because of its majority in the house of 
representatives in the diet japans parliament 
kaifu known as an eloquent speaker pledged to promote 
political reforms to restore public trust in the scandalplagued 
party in a statement formally announcing his candidacy today he 
also stressed the continuation of japans close ties with the 
united states and development aid to third world countries 
in order to protect the peace of our nation and the world i 
will maintain the japanus security system and continue our 
efforts to defend our own country by our own hands kaifu said 
though his career as a 10term member of the house of 
representatives qualifies him as a contender for prime minister in 
the eyes of many party members he has not served in top cabinet or 
party posts and his faction in the party is one of the smallest 
giving him little political power 
on friday the large faction led by former finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa decided to support hayashi who also belongs to one 
of the smallest groups in the party 
seiichi ohta a leading member of the miyazawa faction called 
for an open selection process for the next leader and criticized 
kaifus candidacy as a product of factional maneuvering 
the ruling party is a collection of a halfdozen major factions 
that are differentiated more by personal and financial allegiances 
than by policy or ideology 
ishihara a prominent author known for his conservative often 
nationalist views is supported by some young members of the party 
across factional lines 
he said friday politics do not exist for politicians but for 
the country if we leave the situation as it is now factionalism 
and power politics will continue to prevail 
analysts said kaifu remained the leading candidate because of 
strong backing from factions led by takeshita and former foreign 
minister shintaro abe two of the most powerful members of the 
party 
the partys 405 lawmakers and 47 representatives from local 
chapters will vote in a secret ballot tuesday to chose its new 
president the party plans to have the winner elected as the new 
prime minister in parliament wednesday a new cabinet is expected 
to be announced by late wednesday 
the liberal democrats have been seeking a strong leader who can 
restore public trust in the scandalridden party 
the partys popular no 2 official ryutaro hashimoto 52 had 
been regarded as a potential contender but he formally declined to 
run friday saying his candidacy would have created a further split 
in the party 
party officials said the new leader will serve only until the 
end of october when takeshitas original term expires the party 
then will hold a new election they said

piedmont airlines has suspended two mechanics 
who are suspected of having accidentally left wheel chocks in both 
wing wheel wells of a jet that was forced to make an emergency 
landing in north carolina 
the mechanics whose names were not released were suspended 
without pay pending an investigation by the airline of the 
incident said david h shipley spokesman for usair group 
headquartered in washington 
he estimated the airlines investigation would take four days 
and said until that time the full disciplinary actions will not 
be determined 
usair group owns piedmont and was scheduled to merge the carrier 
into usair today 
the boeing 737 with 100 people aboard left national airport 
bound for columbia sc on wednesday with a stop in charlotte it 
was diverted to greensboro when the crew couldnt get the landing 
gear down no one was injured in the emergency landing 
triangular rubber blocks about called wheel chocks about 2 
feet on a side are used to keep the plane from rolling while it is 
on the ground 
phillip powell an investigator for the national transportation 
safety board said thursday a 2foot wheel chock had been found in 
the left wheel well immediately after the landing and investigators 
found evidence bent hydraulic lines that a chock in the right 
well was thrown out during maneuvers to shake the gear loose 
the two mechanics were assigned to check the plane tuesday 
night and during that check said jay golden director of the 
safety boards regional office in atlanta the aircraft was moved 
six times the chocks were apparently placed in the wells during 
one of those moves he said 
ground crews sometimes stuff the chocks in the wheel well while 
moving planes powell said a practice he called not a normal 
procedure 
powell said routine preflight inspection should have included 
checking the wheel compartments 
pilot larry fuda told investigators he delegated the walkaround 
inspection to first officer david curtis before takeoff 
fuda landed the jet on its right main gear then touched the 
nose wheel down before settling the plane onto its left engine and 
skidding to a halt on the 10000foot runway a shower of sparks 
coming from the scraping metal only the left engine suspended 
below the wing was damaged and the plane is expected to be

president bush met with leaders of the 
nicaraguan contras to reinforce his support for their cause on the 
eve of todays meeting of central american presidents to discuss 
disbanding the rebel force 
contra commander enrique bermudez contra directorate member 
aristides sanchez and other leaders told bush at the 20minute 
meeting friday that any demobilization must be tied to democratic 
reforms by nicaraguas leftist government 
they said if worse comes to worse theyre prepared to 
continue their struggle said one administration official with 
knowledge of the meeting 
bush said he had supported them in the past and would continue 
to do so in the future said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
according to contra spokesman bosco matamoros bush told the 
rebels he was urging the central american presidents to preserve 
the integrity of the resistance until the nicaraguan elections in 
february 
matamoros said that could mean the forces will remain encamped 
in honduras or move into nicaragua under conditions negotiated with 
the sandinistas 
the white house meeting came as nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega announced the domestic political opposition had agreed the 
contras should disband ortega said he will insist at the 
presidents summit that camps housing 12000 contras in southern 
honduras be emptied 
matamoros said the rebels support the principles laid out in the 
ortega agreement announced in managua but only if democratic 
reforms come first 
the central american presidents meet this weekend to work on 
specifics of their earlier agreement that the rebel army should be 
disbanded in return for reform in nicaragua the bush 
administration wants clear signs of democratic change before the 
contras have to disband 
us officials have sidestepped the question of whether that 
means they want to keep the contras together as a fighting force 
until the elections 
you can argue over timing but the answer is we feel that 
we should not be disintegrating the contras until theres some 
assurance that the sandinistas are meeting their democratic 
commitments said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater on 
friday 
despite bushs vote of confidence matamoros said the rebels 
were upset with efforts from certain sectors in the state 
department to divide the contras to speed demobilization 
on capitol hill this week sen christopher dodd dconn 
accused bush of breaking an agreement with congress by urging the 
central american presidents not to disband the contras until after 
nicaraguas feb 25 elections are concluded 
he warned congress could off the 40 million aid package agreed 
to in a bipartisan accord between bush and congressional democrats 
the aid package is to keep the contras supplied with nonlethal 
materials but also can be used for voluntary relocation of rebels 
into nicaragua

like a lot of 5yearolds jennifer wang 
dreams of being many things when she grows up like a lot of 
parents her father is already worried about paying for her 
education 
she wants to be a fireman she wants to be a nurse she wants 
to be a doctor said ho wang 
with the introduction of the first national prepaid tuition 
program wang and other parents would have the option of paying now 
for their childrens education a hedge against the rising costs 
of college 
under the national prepaid tuition plan jennifer could be 
signed up for four years at a college before she can even pronounce 
its name 
if i can have the opportunity of locking in the cost now 
without having to worry about the rate of return in future years 
that would certainly be one of my considerations wang said in a 
telephone interview from new york where he works as a highyield 
bond analyst 
universities such as arizona state wisconsin and george 
washington have expressed interest in the plan proposed by st 
paulbased hemar education corp but many others doubt whether it 
will ever get off the ground 
parents would pay a lump sum into independent investment funds 
selected by colleges with the help of hemar which would charge 1 
percent annually from the interest on the accounts this would 
guarantee a fouryear education as long as the student was 
admitted to the college 
wang said he wondered whether highly competitive schools with 
tight admissions policies would ever partake in the plan 
hemar president p gregory stringer said he hoped the plan would 
be available this fall or winter pending rulings from the internal 
revenue service and the securities and exchange commission 
stringer a former bank official and assistant director of 
financial aid at yale university said he envisions at least half 
of the nations colleges including top schools signing up within 
five years 
his company which is affiliated with the higher education 
assistance foundation a student loan insurer mailed announcements 
about the plan last month to 1350 schools 
it gives them a recruiting device they didnt have before now 
theyre in a position to recruit students at the age of birth if 
theyre particularly aggressive said stringer 
stringer said the plan was flexible in allowing students to 
select schools other than the ones invested in by their parents 
such investments could be transferred in some cases although 
parents would receive only their original investment back without 
interest if their children decided not to go to college or 
selected schools not included in the plan 
we worked pretty hard to make sure this plan had value to 
colleges as well as consumers stringer said 
the national tuition maintenance organization in ann arbor 
mich is introducing its own prepaid tuition plan set up as a 
taxable mutual fund to 30 colleges alumni and supporters this 
month 
some experts have reservations about prepaid tuition saying it 
would be extremely risky for colleges to participate in the plan 
arthur hauptman a policy consultant for the american council on 
education in washington an association of about 1400 colleges and 
universities said it could mean that taxpayers or other students 
would have to pay if the invested prepayments dont keep pace with 
rising tuition costs 
hauptman said a school that hadnt done well in investing the 
prepayments might be tempted not to accept some of the children as 
students because prepayment is no guarantee of admission 
i really do think this tension between the admission office 
and the business office could become very problematic where the 
economies of the plan may dictate who gets admitted to school 
hauptman said 
statesponsored prepaid tuition programs exist already in 
michigan florida and wyoming 
duquesne university in pittsburgh pioneered a plan four years 
ago allowing alumni parents to pay a lump sum guaranteeing four 
years of college assuming the child was accepted for admission 
but duquesne suspended the plan last year because of 
higherthanexpected tuition increases and lowerthananticipated 
earnings on investments that rendered it uneconomical

federal courts get bogged down interpreting 
unclear laws and the supreme court is moving toward returning to a 
method of interpretation that would force congress to legislate 
more carefully supreme court justice byron r white said 
it is a truism to say that over the years congress has come to 
be the primary source of change in federal law the upshot has 
been that much more of the work of the federal courts has involved 
the interpretation and application of statutory law white said 
in a speech friday night before the american bar association 
convention 
in the past 50 years white said courts have determined 
congressional intent of a law based not only on the statute itself 
but on its legislative history including committee hearings 
and reports debates on the floor and conference committee actions 
the courts follow the statutory language if it clearly relects 
legislative intent he said but many cases involve ambiguous 
language and in these cases resort to legislative history has been 
the usual course white said 
this is often a very large undertaking taking hours and hours 
of effort by judges law clerks and librarians to say nothing of 
the time lawyers spend and charge for seeking to present the 
materials that the judiciary has indicated are relevant to 
decision 
with the increasing complexity of subject matter justice 
antonin scalia is advocating a return to interpreting statutes 
based mainly on the legislations text white said 
the debate over how statutes should be interpreted is 
extremely important since it involves how the courts may best carry 
out the will of congress he said 
sometimes white said congress is vague on purpose to force 
court decisions

congress sent a landmark savings and loan 
bailout to president bush early today after a frantic two days of 
wrangling over the finishing touches on the biggest financial 
rescue in history 
the house passed the 159 billion legislation shortly after 
midnight friday on a 201175 vote allowing weary members of 
congress to begin a monthlong vacation that had been threatened by 
a bitter fight with the administration over the financing of the 
package 
house democrats abandoned the bill in large numbers after key 
congressional negotiators bowed to a veto threat by bush and agreed 
to hide 60 percent of the bailouts cost from the federal deficit 
but with the losses of governmentinsured deposits mounting at a 
rate of 20 million to 30 million daily house and senate leaders 
from both parties with vigorous personal lobbying by bush over 
the telephone put together enough votes to replenish an insolvent 
sampl insurance fund with 50 billion 
the savings of million of americans are at stake unless we do 
something sen christopher bond rmo said just before the 
senate approved the bill on a nonroll call late thursday night 
rep chalmers wylie rohio said the nation risked another 
bank holiday similar to the wave of bank closings of 1933 when 
depositors lined up for blocks demanding their savings turning 
what was then a recession into the great depression 
the 50 billion will be used over the next three years to close 
and merge 500 insolvent sampls and pay off depositors whose savings 
were lost to failed and often fraudulent loans over the past 
decade most of them in texas 
the legislation also overhauls the regulation of the industry 
requiring owners of the nations 3000 thrift institutions to put 
up billions of dollars more of their own money as capital to serve 
as a buffer between risky loans and federal deposit insurance funds 
congress and the administration had worked out the reforms weeks 
ago leaving the sticky issue of how to pay for the bailout without 
raising taxes or dipping into other government programs as the 
major roadblock to fixing the sampl crisis 
bush insisted that the money be raised through an elaborate 
scheme using nontreasury bonds to be issued by a new government 
agency created only for that purpose as a way of keeping the 
bailout costs out of the governments official deficit figures 
democrats demanded that the money be borrowed directly through 
the treasury a move that would have swelled the deficit by 44 
billion over three years but would have reduced the 30year 
interest costs on the borrowing by 45 billion 
after bush on thursday threatened to veto the bill if it 
ballooned the deficit the two sides agreed to split the financing 
both ways 
under an accord hammered out by treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady and white house budget director richard darman with key 
lawmakers the treasury will borrow 20 billion before october 
swelling the estimated deficit for this year from 148 billion to 
168 billion 
but the nontreasury bonds will be used to raise the other 30 
billion in 1990 and 1991 raising the deficit a maximum of only 
35 billion the annual interest payments on the borrowing each 
of those years if current interest rates prevail 
just before the vote today rep sam gibbons of florida one of 
135 house democrats voting against the bill complained his 
colleagues had lost their conscience and their backbone in response 
to bushs veto threat 
it should have been paid for by taxes but the president could 
not bring himself to say the word said gibbons so we have 
fostered this unconscionable debt on our children and 
grandchildren 
by the administrations latest estimates the bailout is 
expected to cost 159 billion including interest on the borrowing 
to pay for it over the next 10 years 
over 30 years the costs mushroom to 285 billion of which 
taxpayers will pay at least 157 billion according to the 
congressional auditors in the general accounting office 
the bill also requires sampls to channel more of their lending to 
home mortgages and away from speculative commercial real estate 
ventures and highyield highrisk junk bonds 
it gives the justice department 75 million a year to root out 
fraud at financial institutions and establishes a new agency the 
resolution trust corp to dispose of 300 billion of real estate 
and other property falling into the governments hands through 
failed sampl loans 
for the first time banks will be able to buy and own healthy 
sampls their biggest lending market competitor in many communities 
and the thrift industry will be required to pour 50 million to 
100 million of its profits each year into subsidizing mortgages at 
belowmarket interest rates for lowincome families

the source of future paychecks is uncertain but 
musicians of the detroit symphony orchestra believe the show must 
go on 
youve got to think optimistically trumpet player bill 
lucas said not being paid is a big thing but it takes a lot to 
get here and it wouldnt be the first time i didnt get paid 
the orchestra regarded as one of the nations top 10 is 
verging on collapse with an 8 million deficit if not for a recent 
1 million state appropriation the symphony already would have 
closed 
without 18 million in donations bankruptcy court is the next 
step for the 75yearold orchestra chairman robert s miller jr 
said 
as an executive vice president at chrysler corp miller helped 
guide the no 3 automaker out of a financial abyss a decade ago and 
hopes to reprise that success with the symphony which he took over 
last year 
the musicians believe detroit needs a symphony to help offset a 
national reputation of being ridden with drugs and crime 
a good orchestra would provide better public relations for 
detroit than any car this city could produce said hart hollman 
a viola player in the orchestra since 1973 if a city has any 
intellectual activity it has to have a symphony 
if you dont have appreciation for arts then you dont have 
much 
that appreciation has been lacking and symphony management 
concedes it hasnt been nurtured 
the graying of american audiences is one of the crucial 
problems that all orchestras face orchestra executive director 
deborah borda said if you go to one of our concerts you see the 
average age of the audience is in the late 50s and early 60s 
attendance has lagged at a little more than 50 percent for the 
orchestra has failed not only to draw younger concertgoers but 
also minority patrons the citys population some 1 million is 
about twothirds black 
the orchestra had not listened seriously to a number of 
concerns that were raised by the community about it being a part of 
the community borda said you cant live in a community and be 
totally divorced from it 
the symphony has hired a black bass player richard robinson 
but without going through the normal blind audition procedure in 
which those choosing among the finalists for a position cant see 
the candidates 
that drew criticism from many musicians who while praising 
robinsons ability think his hiring without an audition could 
compromise the symphonys artistic reputation and keep qualified 
musicians from trying out 
borda said the orchestras decision to hire robinson has had a 
profound effect in the symphony industry it has made people 
question themselves about what does the symphony orchestra need to 
do to be more inclusive while not lowering their standards 
as for the financial problems the musicians blame previous 
management 
fundraising also was hurt when music director gunther herbig 
announced he would move to the toronto symphony after next season 
the detroit symphony is one of several us symphonies to run at 
a deficit 
the pittsburgh symphony orchestra considered among the most 
financially secure reported a 15 million loss last season its 
largest ever orchestras in new orleans and nashville recently 
resumed operations after closing temporarily because of money woes 
and the financially plagued denver symphony orchestra started to 
make plans for this season thanks to a survival plan approved 
friday that includes shortening the season by half and cutting 
musicians salaries 
miller and borda have a fiveyear plan to eliminate the detroit 
orchestras debt by 1993 the plan seeks to control costs attract 
urban professionals and blacks increase the orchestras endowment 
and name a replacement for herbig by march 
the orchestra also is moving from ford auditorium downtown to 
the acoustically superior orchestra hall 
the new programs already have shown signs of success 
subscriptions are running 20 percent ahead of those during the past 
five years borda said 
there has been so much bad news about the symphony for so long 
that that general atmosphere makes it tougher to raise money 
borda said

the environmental protection agency is banning 
household ant killers containing the chemical sodium arsenate 
because of the danger of children ingesting the compounds 
the epa said the chemical is used to kill ants that are merely a 
nuisance and do not threaten human health food crops or wood 
structures 
epa spokesman ed heier said friday the product is a sugary 
liquid made by several companies and sold under numerous brand 
names he said that because the purchaser normally applies the ant 
killer and leaves it exposed it is not childproof 
most often the epa said the compound is applied to cardboard 
wax paper bottle caps or food to attract ants

the agriculture department has announced 
details of 95 million in payments to apple growers under a 
program to combat surpluses arising from concern over use of the 
chemical alar 
under the plan 575 million pounds of fresh apples will be 
diverted by 56 growers in six states to an array of organizations 
requesting them including manufacturers of ethanol and livestock 
feed the department said friday 
the plan is designed to divert the apples from normal trade 
channels and thus without disrupting the market reduce a huge 
surplus that piled up during the first half of the year after an 
environmental group charged that alar posed an unacceptably high 
risk of cancer 
governmental officials say that apples are safe to eat and the 
environmental protection agency is taking steps to ban the use of 
alar which is sprayed on fruit to enhance red color extend 
storage life and make harvesting easier 
the payments were awarded to bidders under a 15 million overall 
program to aid the industry that was announced july 25 by the 
department it said growers participating are located in 
connecticut new york maine pennsylvania utah and washington

the five miners who prospectorcannibal 
alferd g packer fed upon in the winter of 1874 were viciously 
beaten to death and their bones picked clean of flesh with knives 
researchers say 
the pangs of starvation cannot adequately and totally account 
for the brutality manifested in these killings said james 
starrs a professor of law and forensic science at george 
washington university 
what we have seen is not merely murder but butchery a 
butchery at once wholesale remorseless unremitting and 
deliberate he said at a news conference friday 
starrs organized a scientific inquiry that last month unearthed 
the bones of the five men in the san juan mountains of southwestern 
colorado 
the expedition was launched to solve one of the grisly mysteries 
of the old west the story of packer a harness maker guide and 
prospector from utah and the men he ate 
a team of 13 scientists and anthropologists using radarmapping 
equipment recovered the remains two miles south of lake city colo 
packer and five other goldseekers became snowbound on a 
9000foothigh pass in february 1874 packer walked out of the 
mountains the following april 
in his confession he admitted having eaten the others to 
survive but said he had shot one of the men shannon wilson bell 
in selfdefense when he returned to camp and found bell had 
murdered the other four with a hatchet 
there is no visible evidence for gunshot wounds on any of 
them said walter birkby director of the human identification 
laboratory at the university of arizona and curator of physical 
anthropology at the arizona state museum 
birkby a forensic anthropologist initially had said last month 
there appeared to be a bullet hole in one pelvic bone but he said 
laboratory examination showed it to be a hole caused by the canine 
tooth of a flesheating animal 
birkby said the youngest victim believed to be 17 or 19 was 
beaten the most severely he was hit at least 11 times in the 
head with an axe 
the young mans shattered upper left arm suggested that he had 
been able for a time to fend off his attacker 
the victim would have been in better shape stronger and perhaps 
better able to withstand the rigors of starvation and temperature 
than his older covictims the oldest of whom was between 50 and 
60 birkby said 
starrs said someone had an insatiable hunger whether for 
human flesh or not i am not about to say this was not mindless 
cannibalism in any sense these bodies were denuded of their flesh 
in a concerted and calculated way 
packer escaped from custody but was captured in 1883 in 
cheyenne wyo and was convicted of murdering one prospector and 
sentenced to hang the sentence was overturned on a technicality 
and on retrial he was convicted of manslaughter and given a 40year 
prison sentence 
packer died in april 1907 six years after he was paroled 
starrs said the bones will be reinterred aug 14 at lake city

a previously unknown group claimed in a 
statement published today that a man killed in a london hotel 
explosion was preparing an attack on british author salman rushdie 
rushdie has been in hiding in britain since feb 14 when the 
late iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said his novel 
the satanic verses blasphemed islam and called on moslems to 
kill the author 
scotland yard said a man was killed thursday as he worked with a 
handmade explosive charge inside a london hotel near paddington 
station 
the statement from a group calling itself the organization of 
islams mujahedeen did not identify the man which it said was the 
groups first martyr 
others would follow his example to try to kill rushdie said 
the statement published in beiruts leading newspaper annahar 
henceforth we warn all those who supported and facilitated 
rushdies works and helped publish the satanic book to back off 
because our hand will reach out for them all the group said 
the statement called on british authorities to preserve the dead 
mans body saying it would make arrangements to recover it later 
in london a spokesman for scotland yard said police were 
discounting claims that rushdie was the intended target of the bomb 
the dead man the only victim of the thursday blast at the 
18room beverley house hotel had been staying there for several 
days police said 
he was believed to have a french passport and be of moroccan 
background according to hotel records although his passport had

a judge ruled the republic of cyprus will 
have to wait until at least next week to take possession of four 
sixthcentury mosaics as attorneys for an art dealer fought to keep 
the artworks in indiana 
us district judge james e noland said friday he would decide 
tuesday when the cypriots could take possession of the mosaics 
which remain locked in an indianapolis vault 
the delay was in response to a motion filed by the cypriots 
seeking immediate possession of the artworks 
noland ruled thursday that peg l goldberg of suburban 
indianapolis must return the mosaics which were stolen from a 
greek orthodox church in cyprus about 10 years ago 
attorneys for ms goldberg meanwhile filed a motion friday to 
keep the mosaics in indiana pending a possible appeal 
joe c emerson an attorney for ms goldberg said that if the 
cypriots were allowed to take the mosaics out of the united states 
there would be grave difficulties in getting the artworks back 
thomas r kline an attorney for the cypriots said his clients 
were determined to reclaim the mosaics as soon as possible 
a local greek orthodox priest had stood by friday to bless the 
mosaics 
michael kyprianou senior counsel for the republic of cyprus 
said an icon which belongs to a church can only be removed after a 
blessing is given by a priest the same procedure is followed 
when you want to take it back kyprianou said 
in cyprus archbishop chrysostomos of cyprus hailed the court 
decision friday as opening the way for the recovery of stolen 
archaeological treasures worldwide 
this encourages us to seek the recovery of other looted 
treasures because it will discourage international art merchants 
who deal in such stolen property he said 
in his 86page ruling thursday noland said ms goldberg never 
obtained title to the mosaics which she bought for 11 million 
last summer in switzerland 
ms goldberg had the mosaics restored last year at an 
indianapolis museum 
the mosaics which date to 530 ad depict jesus as a young 
boy the apostles james and matthew and an archangel they were 
originally part of a larger mosaic on the ceiling of the church of 
the panagia kanakaria 
the cypriots learned the whereabouts of the mosaics in january 
when ms goldberg offered them to the j paul getty museum in 
malibu calif for 20 million 
the republic of cyprus and the autocephalous greek orthodox 
church of cyprus sued ms goldberg and her art dealership goldberg 
and feldman fine arts of carmel in march to recover the mosaics 
the trial began may 30 and lasted six days

cardinal john oconnor of new york told black 
roman catholics the church needs to rid itself of racism and 
appealed to them not to be led out of the catholic church by false 
leaders 
how many phonies are there how many people can you trust when 
you put them in positions of leadership the cardinal said friday 
before about 250 people attending a fourday conference of black 
catholics 
the hottest topic of conversation at the conference is the rev 
george stallings a black washington priest who has formed a 
separate church that combines catholicism with african and black 
american religious traditions 
of stallings oconnor would say only that he is praying for 
everybody involved and is leaving the priests fate up to local 
church authorities the church has suspended him from performing 
sanctioned masses and other sacraments but has not moved to 
excommunicate him 
oconnor implored black catholics not to let racial questions 
force them from the church 
the church cannot be exclusive whether its exclusively 
white exclusively black exclusively yellow oconnor said we 
are all one in the body of christ 
the conference whose theme is creating a spirit of 
africanamerican leadership centers on ways to eliminate racism 
in the church and bring more blacks into top church positions 
archbishop eugene marino of atlanta the first black archbishop 
in the united states said he was saddened at the schism 
highlighted by stallings break but he pointed to himself as 
evidence that blacks can attain power within the hierarchy 
the majority of us intend to stay in the church and bring 
about change and a lessening of racism marino said 
still marino said stallings might accomplish some good with his 
boldness 
i think it has shown the leadership of the church that there 
are these concerns marino said 
a spokeswoman at stallings church the imani temple said 
thursday the priest had no plans to attend the conference held by 
the national office for black catholics and the national black lay 
catholic conference the groups represent more than 1 million black 
catholics 
one speaker during the conference morehouse college history 
professor giles a conwill said stallings could boost black 
efforts to improve their standing in the church 
we may not agree with his method of leaving the church but he 
is a catalyst conwill said 
in his speech oconnor stressed that leaders of black catholics 
or of any other ethnic group must not try to teach their own 
version of christianity 
there are some people campaigning for all sorts of things 
who will promise you a pie in the sky oconnor said but are 
they leading where god wants people to be led 
the cardinal said church leadership could do more to expunge 
racism from its congregations 
the church leadership must make racism a priority oconnor 
said we must get rid of racism in the hearts of catholics

national antidrug director william j bennett 
is targeting drug users to get them to quit and he says hell use 
arrests fines and public embarrassment 
a draft of bennetts national drug strategy obtained friday 
says he wants drug users to lose their drivers licenses their 
cars their federal grants 
and he wants them to get treatment even if they dont want it 
saying it is time to reexamine the premise that voluntary drug 
treatment should continue to be the mainstay of our treatment 
system 
the strategy calls on states to consider expanding the use of 
civil commitment whereby addicts are sent by the courts to 
residential treatment facilities upon their release they are 
required to participate in carefully monitored outpatient 
programs 
the judicial procedures required in many states for such 
involuntary commitment are exceedingly cumbersome and the 
draft says the federal government will propose a model state 
commitment law 
the plan includes what bennett referred to last week as 
carrots and sticks 
if states want full federal highway funds they must adopt 
policies to revoke the drivers licenses of people convicted of a 
drug offense the strategy says if states want federal criminal 
justice funds they must adopt drugtesting programs for all 
arrests prisoners parolees those out on bail and throughout 
their criminal justice systems 
if schools colleges and universities want federal money they 
must implement firm prevention programs according to the strategy 
the strategy seeks a 49 percent increase in federal treatment 
money for 1990 from the current 621 million to 925 million 
in 1987 about 834000 individuals received some form of drug 
treatment or one out of every seven people with a serious drug 
problem the strategy says there is little doubt that if we 
continue to treat only one in seven heavy drug users treatment 
will not make a very large dent in the nations drug problem 
the objectives outlined in the strategy seek 10 percent 
reductions in drug use in two years and 50 percent decreases within 
a decade the plan would set up similar reduction targets for 
supply as represented by estimates of illicit drugs coming into 
the country and estimates derived from reports of the ease of 
obtaining drugs 
the domestic policy council held its first meeting on the draft 
friday and an administration source said the situation is 
fluid with the strategy to undergo revisions before it is sent 
to congress sept 5 
while the strategy does not indicate the total spending proposed 
for law enforcement efforts in 1990 it calls for 12 billion for 
new prisons expansion of federal prison capacity by 85 percent and 
increases in most law enforcement efforts president bush also had 
sought 12 billion for prisons in his may crime proposals 
one of the main focuses of the strategy is the use of crack a 
crystallized form of cocaine in the inner cities 
it is an acid that is fast corroding the hopes and 
possibilities of an entire generation of disadvantaged young

the premieres of nbcs and abcs new 
primetime news shows resulted in mixed reviews but relatively good 
ratings 
nbcs yesterday today and tomorrow made its bow wednesday 
to negative reviews for its cheesy special effects dull stories 
and use of recreations to illustrate some of its stories 
but the reviews didnt deter viewers 
twentytwo percent of the viewing audience opted for ytt 
putting it several points ahead of reruns on cbs wiseguy and 
abc china beach it did as well or better than the parade of 
entertainment shows nbc has tried in the time period which no one 
network has dominated 
yesterday today and tomorrow is getting a threeweek summer 
tryout but isnt on nbcs fall schedule 
the much more highly publicized debut of abcs primetime 
live pairing sam donaldson and diane sawyer formerly of cbs 
got goodtososo notices primetime live is a weekly series 
from here on out 
though it came in last in its time period in the nielsens 
primetime live was a dramatic improvement for abc which has 
been unable to make any headway against nbcs powerhouse thursday 
lineup with entertainment programming such as heartbeat most 
recently lowrated thursday night baseball was in the time 
period 
primetime live drew 18 percent of the viewing audience abc 
normally gets about an 11 a rerun of nbcs la law got 21 as 
did the movie on cbs outback bound 
washington post tv critic tom shales praised primetime live 
saying network television experienced a welcome electrical 
charge last night he called the premiere one of the smoothest 
maiden voyages in television history 
other critics were less enthusiastic walter goodman writing 
for the new york times said donaldson and sawyer made a 
workmanlike team he said no potatoes will be knocked off 
their couches but dubbed the premiere a respectable effort 
steve sonsky of the miami herald called it a good college try 
but not a mustsee yet 
the new york posts dave bianculli was not impressed at all 
this is a show he said that started out with more flash 
than substance and with more desperation than direction 
the critics were pretty unanimous though in criticizing the 
nbc program which featured three coanchors maria shriver mary 
alice williams recently acquired from cnn and local new york nbc 
anchor chuck scarborough 
los angeles times critic howard rosenberg started out his 
review this is a recreation then constructed a fictional 
and unflattering account of what the three anchors might have 
been saying when watching the show 
scarborough god im a commanding figure notice how i speak 
deeply and earnestly my granite chin thrust toward the camera just 
so implying strength and authority my eyes have never sparkled 
like this before and im having such a good hair day i can hardly 
stand it 
rosenberg like other critics was especially bothered by the 
network news programs use of recreations a device identified in 
recent months with syndicated news programs of questionable 
journalistic integrity 
dont the news divisions realize they have enough of a 
credibility problem without shooting themselves in the knee this 
way wondered shales as for the program itself he said if 
you called it journalism as entertainment youd be stretching both 
terms 
concluded fort worth startelegram critic art chapman nbc was 
not any good at putting together a newsmagazine show yesterday 
its not any better today it would be foolish to assume they can 
do better tomorrow

four regional phone companies faced possible strikes tonight 
pending negotiations with unions representing 226000 telephone 
operators linemen and other communication workers in 24 states 
bell atlantic nynex bellsouth and pacific telesis were holding 
separate talks with workers represented by the communications 
workers of america and the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers on the contracts that expire at midnight 
the main differences were over health benefits each of the four 
companies trying to save on medical and insurance bills were 
trying to get unionized employees to pay a larger percentage of 
their medical bills 
the four phone groups are among the seven socalled baby bells 
that were created as a result of the 1984 atampt breakup 
were in what i would call tough negotiations theyre going 
to be negotiating quite heavily in trying to meet that deadline 
said vira milirides spokeswoman for the cwa in oakland calif 
workers may stay on the job past the deadline if the issues are 
close to settlement she said 
pacific bell spokeswoman jill foley said the company was hopeful 
about reaching agreement with the union which represents 44000 
workers in california and 6000 in nevada 90 percent of the 
nonmanagement work force pacific bell and nevada bell together 
form pacific telesis 
milirides said the group wants employees to start paying a 
percentage of their health benefits previously paid entirely by 
the company and is offering wage increases of about 5 percent over 
three years which the cwa says is insufficient 
pay ranges from about 228 a week for some operators to 650 for 
skilled technicians milirides said 
similar issues were being debated on the east coast where 
nynex the telephone company for new york and new england on 
friday raised its offer on health insurance in talks with the two 
union locals representing 60000 workers 
but myles calvey president of ibew local 2222 in quincy mass 
said he doubted the offer would avert a strike 
it amounts to about 2 a week he said its not a 
substantial increase its not something we can accept 
he said many employees joined the telephone company because of 
its generous benefits 
the membership is really 100 percent behind us on this one 
calvey said most employees could understand if the company was 
in some kind of a financial problem but theyve made record 
profits 
nynex spokesman bob obrien said hundreds of management 
personnel are ready to take temporary assignments to maintain 
service in the event of a strike and he predicted that customers 
would barely notice since most telephone operations are automated 
but calvey contended that customers would quickly see a decline 
in service if the unionized operators service technicians linemen 
and clerical workers walked off their jobs 
other downtothewire contracts were taking place in atlanta 
where bellsouth was negotiating with the cwa on contracts for 
64000 workers in nine states and in philadelphia and washington 
dc involving the more than 52000 bell atlantic employees in six 
midatlantic states and washington

president daniel ortega of nicaragua will 
press for the disbanding of the contra rebel force in talks with 
other central american presidents and he has the backing of 
opposition leaders at home 
ortegas leftist sandinista government and 20 opposition parties 
in nicaragua signed an accord friday calling for the usbacked 
rebel force to be dismantled 
the issue is expected to top the agenda when ortega and the 
presidents of honduras el salvador nicaragua guatemala and costa 
rica today open three days of meetings in this caribbean resort 200 
miles north of tegucigalpa 
contra leaders met friday in washington with president bush who 
reiterated his support for their cause the united states wants the 
rebels to remain organized until after general elections next year 
in the accord signed friday the sandinistas pledge to hold free 
and fair elections feb 25 without any restraints on campaigning 
or news censorship they also promise to suspend the military draft 
from september until after the balloting to prevent it from 
interfering with electoral activity 
the sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaints 
by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in 
earlier elections their movements constrained and their exposure 
to the public restricted by news censorship 
even though the opposition is not completely satisfied the 
electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition 
wants said jaime bonilla of the independent liberal party 
speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 parties 
the accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the 
peace process at the summit 
the summit of central american presidents is a followup to a 
february meeting in el salvador at that meeting nicaragua 
promised to hold democratic elections next year and the five 
presidents agreed to devise a plan for disbanding the contra force 
the 11000 rebels and their families are living in honduran base 
camps they began retreating to the camps near the nicaraguan 
border last year when us military aid ran out 
the united states is expected to continue giving the contras 
nonmilitary aid until the elections 
the bush administration has said it wants to see democratic 
change in nicaragua before the contras disband it has not made 
clear if that means keeping the contras together as a fighting 
force until the elections 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said friday in washington that 
the rebels support the same principles laid out in the agreement 
we are not opposed to the question of reintegrating ourselves 
into nicaragua under democratic conditions but those conditions 
have to be negotiated he said 
matamoros said the rebels could stay in honduras until all 
issues are resolved or return to nicaragua under conditions 
negotiated with the sandinistas 
honduras wants the contras out as soon as possible president 
jose azcona hoyo has said he will present a plan for their 
immediate demobilization at the summit 
the presidents at the summit also are to discuss having un 
observers monitor the hondurasel salvador and nicaraguahonduras 
borders 
salvadors new rightist president alfredo cristiani has said 
he wants to link contra demobilization to ending the 9yearold 
civil war with leftist rebels in his country 
el salvador says nicaragua is arming the rebels nicaragua 
which describes its support for the salvadoran rebels as moral and 
logistical opposes linking the two issues 
the tela summit will be the fifth held under a peace plan that 
president oscar arias of costa rica drafted in august 1987 to 
negotiate an end to nicaraguas civil war and leftist insurrections 
in el salvador and guatemala 
despite the regional language of the accord the focus has 
consistently remained on nicaragua 
the contras have been at war with the sandinistas since 1981 
two years after a popular revolution toppled dictator anastasio 
somoza 
an estimated 50000 people have died in nicaraguas war while 
the salvadoran conflict has claimed about 70000 lives most of 
them civilians 
nearly three generations of political violence in guatemala have 
claimed more than 100000 lives the vast majority of them 
civilians

army soldiers set up camp on idaho and oregon fire lines today 
just in time for dry hot weather that had officials worried about 
lightning storms 
shifting winds pushed a brush fire away from southern 
californias mount palomar observatory which 500 firefighters had 
been rushed in to protect earlier friday 
smaller forest brush and grass fires burned in nebraska utah 
and wyoming 
more than 21000 people were at work fighting fires throughout 
the west according to the boise interagency fire center in idaho 
the nations fire suppression headquarters almost 225000 acres 
had been blackened or were burning since a rash of lightning storms 
in the middle of last week 
the fire center has managed so far to get people and supplies 
where they are needed most said spokesman ken showalter but if 
we get another bust of lightningcaused fires things are going 
to be challenging 
about 1300 soldiers and support personnel from fort carson 
colo and fort riley kan were arriving in idaho today said 8th 
infantry col anthony trifiletti 
another 1300 soldiers from the 9th infantry based at fort

near baker ore that burned nearly 20000 acres before being 
contained thursday

several days ago things could really start popping 
six major fires and at least four smaller fires in eastern 
oregon had damaged about 82000 acres of the timber and grazing 
land killing cattle and chasing residents from their homes 
cool and moist weather this week has helped firefighters get the 
upper hand said barbara kennedy a us forest service spokeswoman 
but were getting back to more normal weather now and that 
means firefighters are going to have to work extra hard kennedy 
said from a fire camp in the malheur national forest 
in southern california about 2000 firefighters had contained 
60 percent of a weekold blaze in the cleveland national forest and 
officials couldnt say when they might control the fire said

mission scientists began counting 
down today for the first flight of the space shuttle columbia in 3 
years to release a military reconaissance satellite and a smaller 
scientific payload 
the oldest space shuttle last launched in 1986 has spent much 
of the past few years as a hangar queen stripped like an old 
car to provide spare parts for its sister ships discovery and 
atlantis 
workers began in earnest last november to put columbia back 
together under the direction of ann montgomery the first woman to 
manage the processing of a shuttle for launch 
the countdown began at 1201 am with liftoff between 730 am 
and 1130 am tuesday the defense department will not be more 
specific citing national security but not making it entirely clear 
why the secrecy is needed 
columbia which first flew in 1981 last was launched on jan 
12 1986 its seventh flight it returned to earth on jan 18 and 
10 days later its sister ship challenger exploded 73 seconds after 
liftoff killing its crew of seven and grounding the remaining 
three shuttles 
the postaccident investigation dictated more than 200 changes 
on each shuttle to improve safety and performance with a shortage 
of manpower and new parts the national aeronautics and space 
administration decided that discovery and atlantis newer than 
columbia and more easily refitted would have priority in the 
overhaul 
for most of the time since then columbia languished in a 
hangar with no engines most of its protective skin torn away no 
workers scrambling around on scaffolds 
on sept 29 1988 american astronauts returned to space aboard 
discovery atlantis followed in december discovery flew again in 
march and atlantis again in may 
nasa several months ago set july 31 as columbias launch date 
launch director bob sieck said hes pleased the agency is missing 
it by only a few days considering all that had to be done it 
will be a tremendous relief to get this one done he said 
once in orbit columbias allmilitary crew reportedly will 
release a 10ton reconnaissance satellite with highresolution 
cameras along with a much smaller scientific payload 
this will be the fourth of 30 shuttle flights dedicated fully to 
the defense department as on the earlier ones the pentagon is mum 
about most details including the length of the flight expected 
to be about four days 
defense officials would like to launch these military missions 
in complete secrecy but with thousands of people working on the 
shuttle they know that would be very difficult 
so the pentagon allows nasa to announce a fourhour launch 
window from 730 am to 1130 am tuesday in this case 
and to make the countdown public just nine minutes before the 
planned liftoff

jaime paz zamora the thirdplace 
finisher in may elections was elected president of bolivia 
following an allnight debate in congress officials said today 
paz zamora garnered 98 of the 156 votes after former dictator 
gen hugo banzer suarez cast his support to the 50yearold paz 
zamora head of the social democratic movement of the revolutionary 
left had been arrested by banzer in 1974 and accused of trying to 
overthrow the government 
luis ossio sanjines an ally of banzer and head of the christian 
democratic party was elected vice president 
swearingin ceremonies for the bolivian leaders fouryear terms 
is scheduled for sunday afternoon 
the opposition had held up balloting because of alleged voting 
irregularities in the may 7 election 
no candidate received a majority in the voting so under 
bolivias constitution the congress chose from the top three 
contenders 
squeezed out by the paz zamorabanzer alliance was gonzalo 
sanchez de lozada of the governing nationalist revolutionary 
movement 
sanchez de lozada had received 24 percent of the vote in may 
while banzer who ruled bolivia from 197179 had 23 percent and 
paz zamora 18 percent 
the alliance with banzer assured paz zamora of the votes to win 
the presidency with their two parties holding 79 of the 
congressional seats 
bolivia has had more than 100 coups or revolutions since it 
gained its independence from spain in 1825 and sundays inaguration 
will be the first time in 25 years that a government has completed 
its term and transferred power to a democratically elected 
president 
the alliance between paz zamoras party and banzers 
conservative nationalist democratic action could be an uneasy 
partnership 
paz zamora was jailed for six months after he was arrested in 
1974 and accused of trying to overthrow banzer 
announcement of the alliance came as a surprise to many 
bolivians and led to a run on banks in two days depositers 
withdrew the equivalent of 13 million from the banks 
paz zamora met with business and banking officials thursday and 
told them his government would maintain a free market economy and 
the current stabilization program 
president victor paz estenssoro implemented tough austerity 
measures when he took over in 1985 they included a restructuring 
of state companies firing 23000 governmentemployed miners a 
tenfold increase in the price of gasoline and a wage freeze the 
measures lowered inflation from 24000 percent in 1985 to an 
estimated 6 percent for 1989 paz estenssoro is paz zamoras uncle

shelter of an apartment building in beiruts christian suburb of 
fayadiyeh a police spokesman said it was hit by a salvo of three 
240mm mortar rounds fired by syrian gunners 
the latest casualties raised the overall casualty toll to 537

were buried under the rubble he said 
several ranking officers of aouns army live in fayadiyeh a 
wealthy suburb three miles east of beirut 
the spokesman said soldiers evacuated most of the casualties in 
armored personnel carriers it was very risky for ambulances to 
operate due to intensity of the barrage he said 
he said most of the casualties although civilians were taken 
to the military hospital in christian east beirut 
the fighting started about 10 pm friday sending civilians to 
basements and underground shelters 
the police spokesman said the barrage began as kind of the 
usual artillery exchange with syrian howitzer batteries 
targeting the christiancontrolled coastline north of beirut to 
blockade shipping and aouns gunners retaliating with attacks on 
syrian emplacements in west beirut 
he said the syrians escalated the exchange by deploying the 
240mm mortars in the battle and targeting the shelter 
aouns gunners and their rightwing christian militia allies 
the lebanese forces entrenched in the christian enclave 
responded heavily the spokesman added 
he said christian militia gunners fired their sovietmade 
multibarrelled rocket launchers on residential districts in moslem 
west beirut spitting out 40 rockets per minute 
the christians control a 28mile stretch of lebanons 130mile 
mediterranean coast north of beirut 
the christian enclave home for about 1 million people has been 
besieged by syrian and allied moslem forces in retaliation for a 
blockade by aouns forces of ports run by syrianbacked militias 
south of beirut 
an arab league committee trying to mediate an end to the 
fighting said earlier this week it had reached an impasse and 
blamed syria for blocking its 2monthold mission 
aoun 54 a maronite catholic and other christian leaders 
accuse the syrians of betraying a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from 
the 22nation arab league by supporting moslems against christians 
in the 14yearold civil war moslems are seeking a greater share 
of political power in lebanon which has been dominated by the 
christian minority

plo chairman yasser arafat has comfortably 
survived a challenge by hardliners in his fatah movement 
questioning his renunciation of terrorism and recognition of 
israels right to exist a political adviser said today 
there were some tense debates on political questions brought 
about by the hardliners said nabil chaath political adviser to 
arafat but in fact this has become largely arafats congress 
he was speaking outside the first congress held since 1980 by 
fatah the main component of the palestine liberation organization 
most of the 1000 delegates at the conference backed arafat and 
rejected the challenges to his leadership chaath said 
the hardliners have turned out to be less numerous and less 
noisy than some of the top fatah leaders had feared he said 
all substantive discussions of the congress have been held 
behind closed doors the only journalists admitted are palestinians 
who also are fatah delegates 
on its first two days the congress gave its full backing to the 
peace initiative adopted at arafats urging last november by the 
palestine national council chaath and other delegates said 
specifically as reported by delegates and the palestinian news 
agency wafa the congress approved the councils proclamation of an 
independent palestinian state endorsed arafats acceptance of un 
security council resolutions 242 and 338 which guarantee the right 
of all states in the region to live within secure borders and gave 
full support to the 20monthold palestinian uprising 
in an impassioned speech before the congress friday his 60th 
birthday arafat vigorously defended the peace plan and obtained 
fatahs almost unanimous approval delegates said 
the main task of the congress the fifth since the movement was 
founded in kuwait in 1959 is to renew and enlarge membership of 
the central committee of which arafat is chairman 
the panel has been reduced to 10 members by three assassinations 
and two departures of dissidents the central committee is to be 
enlarged to 20 or 21 members 
several hardliners at fridays sessions challenged the 
timeliness and effectiveness of arafats peace moves delegates 
said and the plo leader spoke repeatedly in the debate to defend 
his actions 
wafa reported friday that the congress proved fatah has overcome 
its internal divisions and regained its unity following widespread 
defections in 1983 
the congress has split into political financial and 
organizational committees and is scheduled to close monday but 
delegates said it could well be extended for several days

the house ethics committee can now begin 
interviewing witnesses and receiving documents as it proceeds with 
preliminary investigations of three lawmakers accused of sexual 
misbehavior 
the committee on friday announced preliminary inquiries into the 
conduct of reps gus savage dill donald e buz lukens 
rohio and jim bates dcalif to determine if theres a reason 
to believe rules violations occurred 
bates denied any wrongdoing lukens press aide said the ohio 
congressman welcomed a full and open investigation savage who 
also has denied wrongdoing could not be reached for comment 
if the committee on standards of official conduct as the panel 
is formally named decides there is reason to believe a 
violation occurred in any of the cases it could issue a statement 
of alleged violation similar to an indictment later in the 
process the committee could hold disciplinary hearings and 
eventually recommend punishment to the full house 
the house republican conference composed of all republicans in 
the chamber asked the ethics panel to investigate lukens who was 
convicted in ohio on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the 
unruliness of a child lukens who is appealing was sentenced june 
30 to 180 days in jail and fined 1000 for having sex with a 
teenage girl 
the committee said the complaint alleged that lukens conduct 
violated a house rule which states a member officer or 
employee of the house of representatives shall conduct himself at 
all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the house 
of representatives 
jarrell lukens press aide said the ohio republican has 
already said he welcomes a full and open investigation where his 
accusers motives and the full record can be brought forth 
he added that lukens would be able to bring the committee 
information about the credibility of the teenage girl and her 
mother which was ruled inadmissible for the trial 
three house democrats filed a complaint against savage this 
month after news accounts said a peace corps volunteer complained 
the lawmaker fondled her while he was traveling in zaire 
the ethics panel said it has been presented with complaints 
concerning the actions of rep gus savage while that member 
traveled to africa in connection with his official duties and 
responsibilities in march 1989 
since the incident the state department inspector general has 
sent investigators to collect information on savages actions 
during official foreign travels according to a house member who 
would speak only as an unnamed source 
news accounts this week said that when savage was in china in 
1986 as part of a delegation from the house science and technology 
committee he revised his schedule and went to hong kong and south 
korea for shopping and sightseeing 
savage told reporters two weeks ago i did nothing thats 
what i did this lie was leaked by the state department for 
political reasons 
the complaint against bates was filed last year by two former 
aides according to published reports the committee said it has 
been presented with sworn complaints from two individuals against 
rep jim bates alleging that they were sexually harassed by rep 
bates and that congressional staff and resources were used to 
perform campaignrelated activities 
bates said i would deny they were sexually harassed and that 
the staff and resources were used to perform campaignrelated 
activities at least under my direction 
bates added i look forward to having the matter resolved it 
has gone on for a year without any action i would like it 
resolved i dont think it warrants a preliminary inquiry but if 
the committee does well cooperate in any way we can 
meanwhile sen david durenberger rminn disclosed friday the 
senate ethics committee has completed its preliminary inquiry of 
his previously revealed book publishing contract and voted to 
proceed with the investigation washington attorney robert bennett 
has been hired by the committee as special counsel to continue the 
probe durenberger said 
durenberger whose deal netted him 100000 over two years 
received income from a publisher who charged book promotion 
fees to groups that sought the senator as a speaker a complaint 
from minnesota lawyers who backed durenbergers 1988 reelection 
opponent hubert h humphrey iii accused the senator of 
circumventing rules limiting speaking fees members can earn

what a television network reported is suspicion of selling secrets 
to the eastern bloc in berlin 
lt joe wiggins a spokesman for the command in san antonio 
texas said friday night that the officer capt john vladimir 
hirsch has been restricted to kelly air force base in san antonio 
wiggins said hirsch who was head of engineering and 
installation at the air forces electronic security wing at the 
west berlin templehof central airport was formally placed under 
investigation when he returned from germany earlier this week 
another command spokeswoman said the wing collects intelligence 
on east bloc radar and communications 
nbc news reported friday that hirsch is suspected of selling 
secrets to the eastern bloc while he was stationed in berlin after 
september 1988 
he is not under arrest and he has not been charged with 
anything said wiggins who would not confirm what the

kenya is increasing security in its 
national parks and trying to reassure visitors following widespread 
publicity about the slaying of a connecticut tourist in a game 
reserve 
the increased security comes amid a clamor by politicians and 
the press over what they say is unfair treatment by the western 
news media 
its war against slanted reports said a headline in 
saturdays kenya times a nairobi newspaper owned by the countrys 
only legal political party 
the accompanying story reported the outraged comments of more 
than half a dozen party leaders decrying news coverage of the 
murder of marie ferraro 50 of bethany conn 
typical was that of joseph kamotho secretarygeneral of the 
governing kenya african national union who said reports of the 
slaying were overblown and intended to scare off tourists 
more than 700000 visitors brought nearly 350 million into 
kenyas economy last year making tourism the countrys biggest 
single source of hard currency 
in an editorial friday the independent daily nation said the 
american press had painted kenya as a benighted country of 
bloodthirsty and crimeprone people 
let us face it the editorial continued there is more 
crime in that metropolis called new york than there is in all of 
kenya a country the size of texas with a population of 22 million 
a gang of armed men attacked ms ferraros tour group july 28 on 
a dirt road between tsavo and amboseli national parks in 
southwestern kenya 
the killers believed to have been poachers have not been 
captured 
it was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists in kenyas 
national parks that began last september gunmen have killed three 
visitors and seriously wounded three 
nonetheless in ordering increased ground and aerial 
surveillance of the parks police commissioner philip kilonzo 
called ms ferraros slaying an isolated incident 
he said police in consultation with tour operators will 
provide armed escorts for tour groups in some of the countrys 
largest and most popular parks 
tsavo divided by kenyas main highway into two reserves 
contains more than 8000 square miles of land much of it remote 
and nearly inaccessible 
the attacks on tourists have coincided with a crackdown on ivory 
poachers who have reduced kenyas elephant population from 65000 
in the 1970s to about 17000 today 
some observers have speculated that the poachers now have turned 
to robbing tourists

if history repeats itself the latest international 
effort to end war in indochina is doomed 
again and again western attempts to cobble together peace 
settlements for vietnam cambodia and laos have proved abortive or 
shortlived the clinking of champagne glasses in european salons 
soon was echoed by gunfire in faraway jungles and rice paddies 
the latest such conference seeks a comprehensive peace package 
for cambodia a country torn apart by war revolution and foreign 
invasion for the past two decades 
nineteen nations including the united states the soviet union 
and china are trying to establish a mechanism to monitor vietnams 
troop withdrawal from cambodia and reconcile the warring sides a 
threeparty guerrilla coalition headed by prince norodom sihanouk 
and the hanoibacked government in phnom penh 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the khmer 
rouge which had turned the country into a murderous experiment in 
ultrarevolution the khmer rouge are partners in sihanouks 
coalition and present a major threat to the complex peace process 
the past hangs heavily over the paris conference hall where the 
monthlong meeting is taking place 
in opening speeches several foreign ministers alluded to former 
failures piecemeal bigpower arrangements that papered over stark 
differences and ignored realities 
on jan 27 1973 washington and hanoi signed accords in paris 
that allowed us ground troops to pull out of vietnam after 
leaving more than 50000 dead on the battlefield 
president nixon hailed the results of four years of negotiations 
between his secretary of state henry kissinger and vietnams le 
duc tho as peace with honor reporters in some areas of 
vietnam however could barely hear radio reports from paris about 
the ceasefire because of the fighting around them 
neither the united states ally south vietnam nor the viet 
cong guerrillas of the south had been much consulted by the main 
protagonists cambodia was largely ignored 
two years later communist forces swept into saigon and the 
khmer rouge began its reign of terror 
some historians trace the roots of the indochinese tragedy to 
another paris conference which followed world war i in 1919 
gathering in the palace of versailles the victors sought a new 
global order but tended to ignore aspirations of peoples under 
colonial rule 
ho chi minh vietnams future revolutionary leader tried to 
argue his case for greater emancipation from french rule but was 
unceremoniously shown the door the struggle for freedom was taken 
to secret communist cells 
ho returned to france after world war ii hoping to negotiate 
independence the vietnamese arrived at fontainebleau near paris 
and finding few preparations for the meeting went fishing in the 
atlantic 
the french were finally routed by hos communists at the battle 
of dien bien phu which ended may 7 1954 the next morning in 
geneva an international conference which included the united 
states the soviet union and china took up peace in indochina 
unlike the current meeting where even enemies smile at one 
another the geneva conference was held at the height of the cold 
war us secretary of state john foster dulles refused to shake 
hands with chinas chou enlai 
its involvement in the korean war made china eager to avoid 
another conflict with the united states and its allies thus chou 
did little to push the cause of his vietnamese communist friends 
who felt cheated and betrayed washington took few initiatives 
vietnam was divided at the 17th parallel pending general 
elections in 1956 hos communists took control of the north while 
the south moved toward alliance with the united states 
the elections never were held the partition lasted 21 years 
and war soon erupted with us forces coming to south vietnams aid 
an international control commission that was to have overseen 
the implementation of the geneva agreement could not carry out its 
task a fate that also befell the iccs in post1973 vietnam and 
laos 
we served on such a commission for 19 years it certainly 
wasnt a resounding success canadian foreign minister joe clark 
told reporters at the current conference which hopes to establish 
an international commission to monitor the vietnamese troop 
pullout a ceasefire and general elections in cambodia 
clark and others agree that to succeed the commission must have 
a clear mandate cooperation from all warring parties and operate 
within the framework of a comprehensive peace plan

opposition leaders praised an accord 
with the sandinista government on next years elections as the 
foundation for democracy in nicaragua 
the accord signed friday after 22 hours of talks between the 
leftist government and 20 opposition parties also calls for 
disbanding the usbacked contra rebel force 
president daniel ortega and his counterparts from honduras el 
salvador guatemala and costa rica will discuss the demobilization 
this weekend at a summit meeting in honduras 
the accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the 
peace process at the summit said jaime bonilla of the 
independent liberal party speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 
parties 
he said that even though the opposition is not completely 
satisfied the electoral process is being channeled toward what the 
opposition wants 
the government promised to put no restraints on campaigning or 
news coverage it also agreed to suspend the unpopular military 
draft from september until after the election scheduled for feb 
25 
the sandinistas began compulsory military service for all men 
aged 17 to 25 in 1983 two years after their war with the contras 
began 
a ceasefire has been in place since last spring when us 
military aid to the rebels ended and the contras began retreating 
to honduran base camps about 11000 rebels and their families are 
now living in the camps near the nicaraguan border 
the pact is a positive base for democratization alberto 
saborio of the opposition national conservative party told a news 
conference friday 
emilio alvarez montalvan another conservative leader said the 
accord will enable the opposition to keep demanding democratic 
guarantees from the sandinista regime and to continue its 
struggle 
luis sanchez of the nicaraguan socialist party called the pact 
an important political step but said it had not resolved 
lingering questions about the legal status of oppositon alliances 
the sandinistas sought the talks after complaints by opposition 
leaders that their candidates were harassed in earlier elections 
their movements constrained and their exposure to the public 
restricted by news censorship 
the accord also calls for a halt to undercover activities during 
the campaign and promises unconditional amnesty to all political 
prisoners including 1605 rebels in nicaraguan jails 
the sandinistas have been in power since a 1979 revolution that 
toppled the somoza family dictatorship 
the united states began supporting the contras in 1982 and 
imposed an economic embargo on nicaragua three years later arguing 
that sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and their 
close military ties with moscow and havana threatened security in 
central america 
i hope the us government will respect this sovereign 
decision of the nicaraguan people and change us policy toward 
nicaragua and that it puts an end to the 1985 economic 
embargo ortega said after signing the accord friday

suburban hialeah the first known church in the usually secretive 
sect 
the dispute between the santeria church and the town of hialeah 
raises questions of religious persecution and animal cruelty as it 
delves into the most unsettling santeria ritual animal sacrifice 
the religion was linked mistakenly to a sadistic 
drugsmuggling cult after human remains were found in matamoros 
mexico last april 
experts on santeria and its practitioners have said that human 
bones are not part of any santeria ritual but chickens pigeons 
doves and turtles and occasionally goats and pigs are sacrificed 
for the initiation of priests in faithhealing and for help in 
love business and family affairs 
sometimes the animal remains are cooked and eaten but in some 
cases they are left by roadsides or in other public places 
the trial in pichardos lawsuit began monday and will continue 
this week us district judge eugene spellman is hearing the case 
without a jury 
officials in hialeah a predominantly hispanic city on the edge 
of miami deny that their efforts to limit santeria rituals amount 
to an attack on religion instead they cite such factors as the 
possibility of infection spread by animal carcasses cruelty to 
animals and the danger that children who witness the sacrifices 
will be psychologically scarred 
in court documents city attorneys noted that bans on snake 
handling and marijuana smoking have been upheld even when the acts 
are considered an integral element of a religion 
santeria believed to have more than 50000 followers in the 
miami area had its origins in the region of africa that is now 
nigeria it was carried by slaves to cuban sugar plantations 
adopted many roman catholic saints as guardians and evolved into a 
folk religion that remains largely underground most adherents are 
cubans or cubanamericans 
pichardo 34 says he is trying to remove the stigma against the 
religion as a lowclass practice and institutionalize its rituals 
which previously have been performed largely in private homes 
after he announced plans for his church in 1987 the city 
delayed its opening with extensive zoning and building code 
requirements 
once we complied with everything they threw at us then it 
became an animal sacrifice issue said pichardo 
the council voted to outlaw sacrifices allow animal slaughter 
only for human consumption prohibit the possession of animals for 
slaughter or sacrifice and incorporate the state animal cruelty 
law in city ordinances 
pichardo accuses city council members of discrimination and 
misusing their political power because of their personal religious 
convictions 
dr charles wetli a witness for the church testified last week 
that most santeria adherents are practicing it because of white 
magic or neutral magic to produce good results not to hurt 
others as chief deputy medical examiner in dade county he has 
studied afrocaribbean religions as part of his work 
in santeria ceremonies a few feathers are sometimes plucked 
from live chickens but never all of them he said a bisected goat 
left on a miami beach street and cases when human bones 
apparently obtained after people died of normal causes have been 
boiled in cauldrons were in his view signs of a different 
afrocaribbean cult called palo mayombe 
pichardo said santerias history of practice in the home hurts 
his effort to bring the religion into the open and may have 
contributed to the mistaken link of santeria to the matamoros mass 
killings this spring 
the alleged leader of the matamoros cult adolfo de jesus 
constanzo was a cubanamerican raised in miami around santeria 
practices but the cults use of human bones in its rituals 
deviated from accepted santeria principles 
it sets off this domino effect and sort of darkens the idea in 
peoples minds of what we are pichardo said but the attention 
generated by the mass murders also helped educate the public he 
said 
there is an enormous lack of material in english that 
seriously deals with the subject matter pichardo said which 
allows for a lot of myths to roam around

a sense of businesslike calm pervaded the 
101st congress as lawmakers left for a monthlong vacation but 
storms loom ahead when they return to face a series of 
longdeferred divisive issues from child care to the minimum wage 
weve gotten the easy stuff out of the way said rep mickey 
edwards rokla a member of the house republican leadership 
september and october are going to be much tougher 
for the moment members of congress were content to marvel at 
what they had accomplished so far despite a year marred by ethics 
problems and other internal conflicts 
leading the list was a compromise bailout plan for the nations 
ailing savings and loan industry the costliest financial rescue in 
the nations history the bill which also imposes strict new 
controls on the industry was worked out in concert with the white 
house 
the house also finished initial work on the 13 spending bills 
that are the essentials of keeping the government running and 
steps had been taken toward strengthening the clean air act and 
meeting the years budget deficit reduction target the senate 
too was well into the process of dealing with spending measures 
weve picked up ground said rep robert michel rill the 
house minority leader michel and others gave credit to new speaker 
thomas s foley dwash who two months ago assumed leadership of 
a chamber bitterly divided and virtually paralyzed by the 
resignation of former speaker jim wright over ethics charges 
its friendlier said rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 
gop leadership official the entire mood of the house is more 
productive 
but while foley has restarted the machinery of the house which 
has responsibility for initiating tax and spending bills he has 
yet to define a legislative agenda and point the way for the 
democratic majority 
as far as the issue of comity i think there is a much better 
relation between the two parties and cooperation between the two 
leaderships here in the house foley said he noted that the 
house had passed some 150 bills since he assumed the speakership 
as many as had been passed in the previous five months 
but democratic leadership aides acknowledge that progress thus 
far has come on legislative nuts and bolts that have not been a 
true test of leadership or party cohesion september and october 
when congress returns will be a time of ideological definition for 
democrats they said 
foley the partys highest elected official began that 
prioritysetting process last week in a private luncheon with the 
democratic chairmen of house committees beginning to answer the 
question of where his partys perspective differs from that of bush 
bushs time to set the agenda has run out and democrats now 
have to answer that question for themselves said a top party 
aide speaking only on condition of anonymity he acknowledged that 
a sharper drawing of party lines also will bring conflict 
the major substantive battles are yet to come said rep vin 
weber of minnesota an influential republican we will be seeing 
the issues that will translate into the next election child care 
taxes economic growth the stage could be set for some fairly good 
battles 
other than progress on the 13 major spending measures the list 
of bills passed so far this year is fairly modest items like a 
900 million farm drought relief bill natural gas price decontrol 
protection for government whistleblowers and a 12 billion 
supplemental money bill for veterans programs 
congress also earlier in the year reached agreement with 
president bush on a budget outline for the year and on a bipartisan 
accord on policy toward nicaragua that provided continued 
humanitarian aid to the contra rebels 
but after early expressions of bipartisanship and cooperation 
conflicts with the white house have proliferated in recent months 
bush vetoed an increase in the minimum wage and the house 
failed to override it leaving the issue moribund democrats vow to 
revive it this fall 
the house gutted bushs defense priorities cutting funds for 
the b2 stealth bomber the strategic defense initiative the rail 
garrison mx missile and the midgetman missile while restoring 
money for two programs he did not want the v22 osprey and the 
f14d fighter the white house hopes to win reversals of some of 
those positions in a housesenate conference 
the house approved a list of sanctions against china which 
went beyond what bush wanted in the wake of beijings crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
both the senate and house voted to restrict the joint 
usjapanese development of the fsx fighter aircraft a move bush 
vetoed on july 31 
an even longer list of problem issues lies ahead whether to use 
federal money or offer tax credits to subsidize child care whether 
to ban flag burning through a law or a constitutional amendment 
how to concoct a new and stronger clean air law and whether to 
seek a compromise on the minimum wage 
while tom foley is no jim wright he is not manipulative he 
is nonetheless a partisan liberal democrat said edwards i 
dont anticipate a real smooth session

johann strauss conducted viennese waltzes in its 
restaurant anna pavlova danced in the ballroom and claude monet 
painted his impressionist views of the thames from a fifthfloor 
suite 
the savoy the distinctly english dream hotel on sunday marks 
100 years of catering to high society providing an opulent 
discreet and dramatic rendezvous for celebrities magnates 
potentates and royalty 
modeled on the great american hotels of the day the savoy was 
built by impresario richard doyly carte adjoining his savoy 
theater home of the gilbert and sullivan operettas from the 
outset it was a byword for exclusivity 
princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii first danced here 
with prince philip winston churchill got the word he had become 
prime minister at the savoy and held war cabinet meetings in the 
pinafore room 
gen dwight d eisenhower sent his dirty linen from the battle 
front the maharaja of patiala had 3000 roses delivered daily 
rock singer elton john left his bath running and flooded three 
floors 
forty years ago people were excluded mainly because of 
money said stanley jackson 78 author of the savoy a century 
of taste 
theres now a more international flavor an infiltration which 
rather destroys the ultrasnobbishness 
the hotel is not snooty or overintroverted it has kept a 
good balance youve got your dukes and your sinatras and they 
seem to mix very well together jackson said in an interview 
single rooms go for 140 pounds or 224 a night while a suite 
can cost as much as 520 pounds about 832 
when it opened in 1889 the savoy was a wonder of the victorian 
age with 24hour room service speaking tubes on every floor and 
67 bathrooms at a time when its most luxurious rival the victoria 
had just four 
oscar wilde scorned the builtin washstands saying that if he 
wanted hot water he would ring for it 
all 202 rooms have buttons marked waiter valet and maid the 
hotel still insists on its own custommade mattresses pure linen 
sheets and towels it keeps separate kitchens on all eight floors 
and decorates no two rooms the same using art deco and traditional 
english country styles 
the reservation office keeps 120000 file cards listing the 
needs and idiosyncrasies of regular visitors a staff of 650 
attends to 300 guests who in an average year order 350 pounds of 
caviar 9500 sides of smoked salmon 52000 oysters and half a ton 
of foie gras 
requests are almost never too eccentric 
frank sinatra hankered after an espresso machine so the manager 
bought one for him an italian marquise required live rabbits to 
feed his roommates a pair of boa constrictors 
in 1905 a south african millionaire flooded the forecourt to 
recreate a venetian canal and enrico caruso serenaded from a 
gondola the maharaja of patiala booked 35 rooms and installed a 
silver bathtub and a private elevator in scarlet and gold lacquer 
us golf champion walter hagen started a tradition of driving 
golf balls off the roof into a barge on the thames 
asked how long he would be staying groucho marx snapped till 
it stops raining 
but a visitor from chicago who bought a bulletproof vest and

china today disclosed for the first time that 20 
people died and 1200 suffered radiationrelated illnesses in 
nuclear accidents from 198085 
the official china daily quoted luo guozhen of the state 
environmental protection bureau as saying china needed stricter 
control over the handling of radioactive waste and that the 
government plans to build more disposal sites to handle the 
material 
several accidents involving nuclear waste have been reported in 
the past but there have been no official disclosures of deaths 
luo told the paper that ignorance about the dangers of nuclear 
materials and managers who ignored regulations on handling 
radioactive waste had caused radiation leaks 
in february the china daily reported an accident that occurred 
last december when some uranium was lost from a factory and 15 
people were exposed to radiation one man suffered thirddegree 
burns the report said 
in 1986 an article by zhou zhumou at the ministry of nuclear 
industrys bureau of safety protection and health said there were 
cases of exposure to radiation when chinas nuclear industry 
started up in the mid1950s 
it said that during the 196676 cultural revolution when 
scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns a 
serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern 
china 
zhou said that about 10 people suffered from overexposure to 
radiation in that accident and that another man got uranium 
poisoning in an accident in 1973 but he said there had been no 
cases of acute radiation sickness 
the soviet union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 chernobyl 
nuclear accident 
in the united states one man died in an accident in 1986 at the 
kerrmcgee atomic plant in oklahoma and three people were killed by 
radiation at an experimental reactor in idaho in 1961 
the china daily also reported that china plans to begin 
construction of nuclear waste sites in eight provinces to handle 
its growing production of radioactive material 
nuclear dumps already have been built in 12 provinces it said 
it quoted luo as saying the only major regions that will not have 
waste storage sites after 1990 would be hainan island and tibet 
he said the facilities are needed to handle waste produced by 
about 1000 industries and research establishments across the 
country 
most of chinas nuclear waste so far has been generated by the 
military but growing amounts are being produced by scientific 
labs hospitals and nonmilitary industries 
adding to the waste storage problem is the planned december 
startup of the qinshan nuclear power plant in zhejiang and the 
1992 scheduled opening of the daya bay plant in southeast chinas 
guangdong province 
earlier this year the paper reported that china was making 
plans for its first permanent nuclear waste dumps to be built in 
the coastal zhejiang province and in northwest china 
the report in february quoted pan ziqiang director of the 
safety department of the state national nuclear industry corp as 
saying that so far all of chinas nuclear wastes have been put in 
concrete basement facilities and those sites only protect the 
material for about 10 years 
todays report did not describe the facilities being built

the senate itched to be done but sen john 
glenn was irate he didnt like a proposal to pay 525 government 
employees up to 134250 a year which is more than senators get 
i think we have within this bill the seeds of the destruction 
of the civil service system of the us government said glenn 
dohio i do not overstate that one iota 
but the senate approved the measure anyway and went on to vote 
to give law enforcement authorities authority to shoot down 
airplanes suspected of carrying drugs if the pilots ignore warning 
shots 
the house voted to remodel the old mansion occupied by dan and 
marilyn quayle to better accommodate their three children on the 
third floor and reversed itself on the question of 
taxpayersupported abortions in the district of columbia 
so it goes when congress wants to go airplane tickets in hand 
the congress was determined last week to get out of town measures 
that might not have survived more leisurely scrutiny got voted up 
or voted down but disposed of in any event 
an aide to the senate foreign relations committee was overheard 
to observe that congress wouldnt be here in any part of august if 
the capitol werent air conditioned 
prayed the chaplain when the senate met wednesday gracious 
father in heaven as inevitable tension builds with cosmic issues 
often controversial occasionally confusing compounded by the 
relentless ticking of the clock grant to thy servants in the 
senate cool heads warm hearts patience with each other 
from time to time a member of congress arose to warn middle 
eastern terrorists who threatened to kill hostages that american 
patience had its limits 
president bush rushed back from an outoftown speaking swing 
and moved ships always trouble signals but denied that he was 
in a crisis mode while working singlemindedly on a diplomatic 
solution 
meantime the congress did its will and took a couple of 
surprise turns 
the house voting on a federal contribution to the citys 
budget refused to deny the district of columbia authority to spend 
public funds on abortions for the poor that move caught all sides 
off guard bush said hed veto the measure if it reached his desk 
that way 
last year the house had done the opposite but the supreme 
courts decision giving states new leeway on abortion has 
politicized the issue with abortion right sentiment strong in 
polls 22 members changed their minds 
glenns ire was aroused by a measure which would raise the pay 
of 525 key technicians and scientists in the defense and energy 
departments in order to keep competititive with private enterprise 
members of congress by contrast get 89500 
the senior executive association which like glenn opposes 
piecemeal raises went nuclear in its denunciation an 
illconceived poisonous stew that will sicken the federal executive 
corps 
glenn was equally unhappy with another measure giving law 
enforcement agents broad authority to bring down planes suspected 
of carrying drugs and other contraband 
he said if he were flying and another plane approached him hed 
probably turn tail and run he lost again the senate approved the 
measure by voice vote sending it and the pay question to an 
uncertain future in the house in the fall 
as for refurbishing the 1894 victorian vice presidential mansion 
to meet the needs of the quayle family plans originally called for 
using privately raised funds but a house appropriations 
subcommittee after sending staff director aubrey gunnels to look 
the situation over decided to spend public money the house 
approved 200000 
congress and the white house settled a controversy over whether 
the cost of bailing out the savings and loan industry should be 
included in the deficit as democrats wanted or left out as bush 
insisted again threatening a veto 
the question was resolved in a classic washington way splitting 
the difference house and senate conferees decided that 40 percent 
should be reflected in the deficit 60 percent left out 
and while the house waited for the senate to pass that vital 
bill so congress could quit it passed the time by passing 
resolutions 
one designated sept 8 as national pledge of allegiance day one 
commended the people of sioux city iowa for their help when an 
airliner crashed at their airport and one adopted in the nick of 
time designated next tuesday as national neighborhood crime watch 
day

one of the first soviet visitors to 
tour the uss thomas s gates looked at the cruisers onboard 
helicopter with admiration 
great helicopter he told aviator matt gentry of seattle 
great country gentry responded gesturing toward shore 
around this black sea ports streets over the weekend residents 
mingled in friendship with about 600 seamen from the first two 
american warships ever to dock here 
this city of almost 400000 people founded as a greek colony in 
422 bc often has known visitors of a less welcome variety its 
strategic position on the crimean peninsula across from turkey led 
to attacks over the centuries by turks french british and 
germans 
on saturday sevastopol residents mobbed the americans almost 
everywhere they went many had never seen westerners because this 
port city is headquarters of the soviet black sea fleet and 
normally is a restricted zone 
the ameircan sailors sampled the wares of a local wine factory 
relaxed in the local officers club and shopped in a military 
store they strolled through the seaside town and hobnobbed with 
locals many of whom showered them with gifts and invited them home 
it looks like the soviets are trying to match what we gave 
them said bill hayes from poland a village in upstate new york 
so far it looks like theyre doing pretty well 
soviet crews of three ships were feted in norfolk va last 
month as part of the first such sovietamerican exchange of port 
calls in 14 years 
navigator george hughes who is based in norfolk set out to 
trade some american souvenirs for soviet items 
my wife wrote me that she did a little trading when the soviet 
fleet hit norfolk so ive got to match her he said 
soviet gifts to the american sailors included candy rubles 
childrens toys scarves flowers postcards and emblems from 
soviet naval uniforms 
however the american ships were ready for the gift exchanges 
said montana native pierre ross the gates chief petty officer 
they had special tshirts printed up and provided sailors with 
pins hats and other knickknacks 
hayes the gates dispersing officer said his ships crew of 
350 had been given a total of about 10000 in rubles to spend in 
town 
were especially curious about how the beer tastes he said 
in a store where soviet military uniforms are sold and only 
soviet servicemen are normally allowed to shop two american 
sailors were unfazed when told of the stores restrictions 
thats okay one said were military too 
in fact plenty of american seamen could be seen sporting soviet 
medals and caps their own round white sailor hats graced the 
heads of more than a few young sevastopol women 
greg marlatt the gates medical officer said he wanted to 
spend his time in sevastopol exploring soviet medical practices 
one sailor apologized as he extricated himself from a crowd of 
children and adolescents explaining sorry im just all out of 
pennies 
tours of the american ships the gates and the frigate uss 
kauffman were scheduled to continue until their departure tuesday 
they arrived friday 
a year ago the city played host to a small delegation with 
frank carlucci then us defense secretary but navy public 
affairs officer paul weishaupt said this was the first time us 
ships had docked at sevastopol 
this is a very unusual flag to see here agreed former 
soviet navy lt valery karyakin as he looked at the stars and 
stripes on one of the ships

nuclear accidents caused mainly by careless 
handling of radioactive materials killed 20 people and injured 
1200 in china from 1980 to 1985 an official report said saturday 
luo guozhen of the state environmental protection bureau said 
china needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and other 
radioactive materials the official china daily reported 
luo did not say how many accidents occurred from 1980 to 1985 
and he did not give details of those that did occur according to 
the report 
ignorance about the dangers of nuclear materials and managers 
who ignored regulations on handling radioactive waste caused 
radiation leaks in recent years the newspaper said 
it was chinas first report on deaths caused by radioactivity 
china previously has disclosed that nuclear accidents had 
occurred but it did not acknowledge they had caused severe 
radiation sickness or deaths 
there are no nuclear power plants in operation in china 
although two are under construction most of chinas nuclear waste 
so far has been generated by the military but growing amounts are 
being produced in laboratories hospitals and nonmilitary 
industries 
some of the accidents resulted from workers stealing containers 
used to hold radioactive materials 
in december a carpenter at an electric equipment plant in 
coastal jiangsu province stole a lead container used to hold cobalt 
60 the report said 
no deaths or injuries have been reported in that case it said 
in february the newspaper reported some uranium had been lost 
from a factory exposing 15 people to radiation 
in 1986 an article by zhou zhumou of the ministry of nuclear 
industrys bureau of safety protection and health said an 
unspecified number of people were exposed to radiation when chinas 
nuclear industry started up in the mid1950s 
during the tumultuous 196676 cultural revolution when 
scientists and technology were ridiculed in political campaigns a 
serious accident took place at a production reactor in northwestern 
china zhou said 
about 10 people were exposed to radiation in that accident and 
another man got uranium poisoning in 1973 but there were no cases 
of acute radiation sickness he said 
the soviet union has reported 31 deaths from the 1986 chernobyl 
nuclear accident 
in the united states one man died in an accident in 1986 at the 
kerrmcgee atomic plant in oklahama and three people were killed 
by radiation at an experimental reactor in idaho in 1961 
saturdays report says china plans to build nuclear waste 
storage facilities to handle the growing volume of radioactive 
waste produced by about 1000 industries and research labs 
the scheduled startup of the qinshan nuclear power plant in 
coastal zhejiang province next december and of the daya bay plant 
in southeast guangdong province in october 1992 will mean a 
substantial increase in chinas production of nuclear waste 
in the past china stored radioactive waste in concrete basement 
facilities designed to protect the materials for only 10 years 
according to pan ziqiang of the china national nuclear industry 
corp 
luo said waste storage facilities now have been built in 12 
provinces and are planned for eight others he did not describe the 
facilities

the mermaids of legend glided 
effortlessly through the seas tempting mortals with their beauty 
and grace its not so easy in real life 
at weeki wachee spring hundreds of young women apply each year 
but few show the needed athletic skills fearlessness and good 
looks to perform far under water at one of floridas oldest tourist 
attractions 
its tough there is no doubt about that said genie young 
mermaid supervisor we have some strict requirements and only a 
few of the girls actually go on to become mermaids 
fortytwo years ago the enormous freshwater spring with 
startlingly clear water which extends more than 100 feet down was 
turned into a tourist attraction mermaids wearing skintight 
suits that taper into a dolphinlike tail fin gulp air through 
hoses during the choreographed routines viewed by spectators in a 
subterranean amphitheater 
weve done a lot of different things said ms young 
weve eaten bananas and drank coke underwater weve recreated 
scenes from movies one of the hardest things was eating a 
sandwich it gets soggy pretty quick 
but for beginners i would say the toughest part is learning 
to only take in only about half a lungful of air said ms young 
who performed as a mermaid from 1961 to the early 1970s 
otherwise you will float to the surface 
the attraction also features an exhibit of photos of living 
mermaids and a shrine to swimmeractress esther williams although 
never a weeki wachee mermaid ms williams filmed a movie at the 
spring and made numerous guest appearances 
despite the specter of discrimination suits weeki wachee 
remains extremely selective about its mermaids who now number 26 
several attributes are manadatory an attractive figure and at 
least shoulderlength hair said ms young but even most of those 
with the right looks get shipped back to land following the 
swimming test 
the first thing we look for is if youre afraid of the 
water said ms young if youre nervous being underwater 
forget it 
applicants must swim for 30 minutes and perform simple 
underwater ballet and acrobatic moves such as back flips and deep 
dives the few that remain go on to begin serious training and 
instructions in how to use the air hoses and swim in various 
costumes 
they start at 4 an hour and it may take up to a year to pass 
the apprentice stage said ms young 
marti worsham the veteran mermaid of the staff with 16 years of 
swimming behind her recalls watching the mermaids swim around 
large flowers when she was a little girl 
from then on i always wanted to be a mermaid said ms 
worsham i never expected i would one day be the one here the 
longest 
at the end of a show after the theater had emptied a mermaid 
scrubbed algae from the windows with a steelwool pad a turtle 
swam nearby 
this is part of the job the tourists dont see said ms 
young cleaning up isnt part of the myth of the mermaid

iran said today that it refused to 
receive a note from the united states on events in lebanon amid 
reports that algeria has assumed a leading role in efforts to free 
western hostages 
irans islamic republic news agency quoted an unnamed foreign 
ministry official in tehran as saying the us administration 
sent a message to irans foreign ministry last week through a third 
country since the content had nothing to do with iran the message 
was not accepted 
irna monitored in cyprus said the official was responding to 
reports that president bush had appealed to iran to prevent the 
killing of western hostages in lebanon irna gave no further 
details 
the washington post and several beirut radio stations reported 
today that bush had specifically asked algeria to intercede after a 
proiranian group said it killed american hostage lt col william 
r higgins and another group threatened to kill hostage joseph 
cicippio 
in washington us officials sought to downplay any negative 
interpretation of the irna report 
basically weve been trying to get different people to weigh 
in said one closely involved source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity we have been able to get our messages one way or 
another through to the parties certainly to the iranians 
meanwhile marrack goulding head of the un peacekeeping 
operations flew to beirut by helicopter from south lebanon for a 
third day of talks with lebanese leaders and then left for syria 
goulding is trying to resolve the fate of higgins and push efforts 
to set the hostages free 
before leaving for syria goulding told reporters that algeria 
is playing an extra part in trying to resolve the hostage problem 
as algeria has done in previous cases 
he said he had not yet obtained concrete proof that col 
higgins is dead and i pray he is not dead 
an extremist shiite moslem group calling itself the organization 
of the oppressed on earth said it hanged higgins monday because 
israel refused to free a moslem cleric it abducted from south 
lebanon nine days ago no body ever has been found and there have 
been reports higgins died months earlier 
higgins 44 a decorated vietnam war veteran was head of a 
76man observer team attached to the un peacekeeping force in 
south lebanon known as unifil when he was kidnapped feb 17 1988 
sixteen westerners have been held hostage in lebanon the 
longest nearly 4 years their plight gained renewed international 
attention eight days ago when israeli commandos kidnapped a shiite 
moslem cleric with ties to iran leading to the threats against 
american captives 
irans new president hashemi rafsanjani said friday that a 
reasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and that he was 
willing to help the united states find it 
i tell the white house the problem of lebanon has solutions 
the freeing of the hostages has solutions reasonable prudent 
solutions rafsanjani said in his sermon in tehran at weekly 
moslem prayers 
his comments appeared to be the strongest indication yet of a 
possible accommodation between the countries since islamic 
fundamentalists ousted the usbacked monarchy in iran 10 years 
ago 
algiers radio said today that progress was made in talks friday 
involving algerias ambassador in beirut khaled hasnawi 
hasnawi said in an interview in todays washington post that 
algeria had assigned an official delegation including politicians 
and intelligence specialists to the task of getting in touch with 
the parties holding captives 
the radio report said hasnawi met with the spiritual leader of 
hezbollah the group believed to be holding western hostages 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah and with goulding 
the talks involved all hostages whether lebanese 
palestinians americans europeans or israelis according to the 
report progress in this mediation was accomplished it added 
without elaborating 
state department spokeswoman nancy beck said friday that she was 
aware of the report but added i have nothing specific on that 
algeria while proud of its role in mediating past crises 
including the 1981 release of american hostages held in the us 
embassy in tehran usually is closemouthed about its involvement 
until an issue is settled the radio report was seen as a sign that 
algerian authorities think a deal is close 
today goulding met with army commander gen michel aoun who 
heads a christian military cabinet he also was to meet with acting 
prime minister salim hoss who heads a syrianbacked mostly moslem 
cabinet vying for legitimacy with aoun 
the tehran times published an interview with the head of the 
iranian parliaments foreign affairs committee said rajai 
khorasani in which he said he deeply regretted the killing of 
higgins but he said israel was to blame 
the revolutionary justice organization one of the kidnapping 
groups believed to be fronts for hezbollah said thursday it was 
suspending its death sentence against cicippio and replacing it 
with demands that israel free palestinian and lebanese prisoners 
in jerusalem israels top leaders conferred about a response to 
the demands which revolutionary justice said must be accepted 
within days it did not say what would happen to cicippio if 
israel refused he was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
hasnaw told the washington post that bush had asked president 
chadli benjedid of algeria to intercede in the ciccipio case and 
that fadlallah deployed great efforts to defer the execution for 
which he is thanked 
following contacts begun yesterday with hezbollah in the form 
of pleading and entreaties concerning cicippios execution and 
after we strongly condemned the abduction of the cleric we 
counseled patience and selfrestraint and called for abstention 
from dramatic measures and decisions 
had cicippio been killed there would have been an 
explosion the post quoted hasnawi as saying 
it would have led to a dangerous reaction america or israel 
would have intervened militarily without anyone knowing the full 
scope or nature of such an intervention he said 
rafsanjani who was inaugurated thursday is believed eager to 
improve ties with the west and erase irans image as a sponsor of 
international terrorism 
israel has offered to trade the cleric and other shiite 
prisoners for three israeli soldiers held in lebanon and for the 
western hostages 
of the 16 westerners held in lebanon eight are americans held 
longest is terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press who was seized march 16 1985

fresh from stinging defeats in separate 
battles with conservative republicans and liberal democrats 
attorney general dick thornburgh brushes aside talk about his 
difficulties with congress 
im a difficult attorney general i think a smiling 
thornburgh told reporters last week after the senate judiciary 
committee killed the nomination of william lucas his choice to be 
assistant attorney general for civil rights 
in making the comment thornburgh seemed to revel in the prickly 
side of his personality which surfaces frequently in flashes of 
anger when questioned about sensitive issues by legislators or 
reporters 
that anger flared last week when he blamed lucas defeat on 
raw politics and later accused the judiciary committee of 
blocking the nominee for failing a litmus test on civil rights 
issues 
thornburgh denies his political standing was hurt by the losing 
bouts with democrats over lucas for the civil rights post and 
earlier with republicans over robert b fiske jr to be deputy 
attorney general 
democrats questioned the qualifications of lucas a black 
detroit republican who has never tried court case but was once 
sheriff and later chief executive of wayne county mich 
fiske a prominent wall street lawyer with strong legal 
credentials ran afoul of conservative republicans because of his 
role in screening president reagans judicial nominees for the 
american bar association 
after his public anger cooled thornburgh waxed a bit 
philosophical about lucas defeat last week on a pair of 77 votes 
by the judiciary committee 
ive been in this business a long time there are some efforts 
that are worth fighting for thornburgh said its worth the 
effort and the criticism that comes from trying to attract good 
people to serve in government 
but as he prepares to celebrate the first anniversary of his 
swearing in this week thornburgh is still searching for people to 
fill the two important positions at the justice department 
thornburgh also is also skirmishing with congress over his plans 
to close the departments 14 organizedcrime strike forces and 
merge them with local us attorneys offices and may be heading 
for a confrontation by claiming a right to ignore congressional 
objections to his plans to reorganize the department 
the lucas battle has raised some questions about thornburghs 
ability to operate on capitol hill spokesman david runkel 
dismissed any suggestion thornburgh and his aides misread the 
situation 
our people had every expectation that even on a tie vote the 
committee would send the name forward to the senate he said i 
dont think there was any way for us to predict the outcome until 
an eleventhhour democratic caucus its clear that they made the 
decision late to play hardball 
after rejecting a motion to recommend lucas on a 77 tie the 
committee also defeated on the same vote an attempt to report the 
nomination to the floor for further action 
this is a journey you have some things you win some things 
you lose runkel said the things you lose you learn by them 
the lucas vote last tuesday came barely a month after fiske 
withdrew from consideration for the justice departments no 2 spot 
senate republicans including strom thurmond of south carolina 
and gordon humphrey objected to fiske saying that as chairman of 
the abas judicial screening panel he had scuttled some of reagans 
nominees to the federal bench 
thornburgh tried to allay the conservatives suspicions about 
fiske last spring telling congress fiske had help negotiate an 
agreement whereby the aba consented not to evaluate a judicial 
candidates political or ideological views 
but thornburghs announcement blew up in his face hours later 
when the aba said there was no such agreement 
an angry thornburgh then threatened to cut the aba out of all 
judicial screening unless his terms were accepted 
the aba and thornburgh came to terms after a onemonth delay 
but that gave fiskes opponents more time to raise doubts about the 
appointment and fisk bowed out in early july 
something you learn is timing a lesson that can be applied 
to the lucas case as well as the fiske episode runkel said 
i dont think anybody doubts lucas would have been confirmed 
if the senate had voted on him prior to all the recent supreme 
court decisions runkel said 
lucas defended the series of high court rulings on civil rights 
that are unpopular with liberal democrats echoing the bush 
administration policy that no legislation is needed to overturn 
them 
lucass answers disturbed several democrats on the judiciary 
committee prompting thornburgh later to accuse the panel of 
applying too narrow a test on civil rights issues 
i find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the 
president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an 
important area of the law thornburgh told reporters last week 
runkel maintained that both lucas and fiske were victims of the 
politicization of the confirmation process 
democrats argued that the issue with lucas was not politics but 
qualifications 
despite that judgment runkel insists lucas is a solid guy 
who will have a position in the administration if he wants it 
the same day thornburgh lost the bitter fight with civil rights 
groups over lucas the attorney general helped negotiate compromise 
legislation to end discrimination against the nations 43 million 
americans with disabilities 
civil rights lobbyist ralph neas who fought the attorney 
general on lucas said thornburgh played a very pivotal role 
behind the scenes forging the compromise 
one of the more fascinating aspect of politics is that todays 
adversary can be tomorrows ally neas said in this case it 
was that todays adversary can be todays ally

congress ended a bitter twoday parliamentary 
standoff early saturday by adopting a 159 billion rescue of the 
savings and loan industry handing president bush a victory on his 
first major legislative initiative 
the bill described as the most important financial law enacted 
since the depression provides money to close or merge an estimated 
500 insolvent thrift institutions and to pay government obligations 
incurred in the rescue of 223 sampls last year 
the administration estimates the cost including interest 
payments on bonds issued to finance the bailout at 159 billion 
through 1999 at least half the money will be spent in texas where 
a combination of lax regulatory oversight and an economic downturn 
sent the industrys losses soaring 
much of the rest goes to other oilproducing states such as 
oklahoma and louisiana and to california and florida where thrifts 
were permitted to enter businesses far removed from traditional 
home mortgage lending 
it is without doubt the single biggest bill in the history of 
this country said sen jake garn of utah the ranking gop member 
of the senate banking committee 
in a series of what bush calls never again provisions the 
legislation overhauls the regulatory bureaucracy imposes stringent 
financial and accounting standards on sampls and quadruples the 
maximum jail term for defrauding a financial institution 
analysts say the law will touch the lives of everyone who pays 
taxes owns real estate or deposits their money in a thrift 
institution or bank 
the shutdown of sick thrifts paying high interest rates likely 
will lower rates to all savers because healthy sampls and banks have 
raised theirs to compete for deposits economists believe 
when the government moves to sell an estimated 300 billion in 
real estate inherited from failed sampls the glut of properties 
could depress prices in already fragile markets primarily in the 
southwest 
many lawmakers sensitive to the public perception that they in 
effect are giving taxpayer dollars to crooks and con artists said 
the bailout was the only way to protect millions of depositors 
whose accounts are federally insured up to 100000 
we are not bailing out sampls we are not bailing out their 
owners or stockholders we are standing behind our promise to 
protect the savers of america said rep chalmers wylie of ohio 
the senior republican on the house banking committee 
legislators nevertheless were reluctant to vote for the 
measure but about five minutes after midnight the bill passed 
the house by a 201175 vote the senate had approved it less than 
two hours earlier in an unusual procedure that avoided a record of 
which members voted for and which against 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate 
banking panel said the rare division vote in which senators 
stand to cast their ballot was used as part of informal 
arrangement that unsnarled a parliamentary tangle involving 
unrelated measures riegle said the bill would have passed with 
about 70 votes had a roll call been taken 
the sampl bill which runs to nearly 1000 pages is the first 
major piece of legislation initiated by bush only two weeks after 
taking office the president called on congress to act in 45 days 
to stem a financial emergency inherited from the reagan 
administration it took congress six months but lawmakers gave 
bush substantially what he wanted 
the crisis had been building for years but was little discussed 
in government outside of regulatory agencies and congress banking 
committees bush and his democratic opponent michael dukakis 
virtually ignored the issue during the 1988 election campaign 
the final dispute holding up passage had little to do with the 
sampl problem and much to do with the political struggle between 
congress and the administration over balancing the federal budget 
deficit 
bush wanted to finance 50 billion of the program through a new 
quasiprivate agency thus keeping sampl spending from ballooning the 
federal budget deficit which in turn would trigger automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts under the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
democrats trying to pressure bush into reneging on his no new 
taxes pledge wanted to embarrass the administration with 
climbing annual deficits they would have avoided the spending cuts 
by simply waiving grammrudman 
the white house claimed that would have set a precedent opening 
the way for a congressional spending spree on other projects 
democrats said their plan saves billions of dollars in interest 
costs because the government would borrow bailout money with 
regular treasury debt 
on thursday morning bush threatened to veto the sampl bill unless 
it included his funding plan shrugging off the threat the house 
voted 221199 to adopt the democratic proposal the senate 
however fell six votes short of the 60 needed to waive 
grammrudman and sent the legislation back to a conference between 
the two chambers 
with the participation of treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
and budget director richard darman congressional negotiators 
worked out a compromise late thursday night 
twenty billion dollars will be raised this year under the 
democratic plan inflating the deficit to about 168 billion the 
highest in three years the remaining 30 billion will be raised 
under the presidents scheme keeping the spending out of the 
deficit in 1990 and 1991 
on friday opposition to the pact from two influential house 
chairmen rep dan rostenkowski dill of the ways and means 
committee and rep leon panetta dcalif of the budget 
committee jeopardized final passage 
there is a time to fold and there is a time to be bold 
rostenkowski said urging democrats hold out for their plan through 
the early morning hours 
but he and other speakers were interrupted with periodic shouts 
of vote vote from members anxious to follow their 51 
colleagues who had already gone home 
in the end the lure of summer vacation proved more powerful 
enough democrats folded to allow republicans to pass the compromise

israeli ambassador moshe arad got a full six 
hours sleep wednesday night for the first time in five days 
his waking hours were spent in a frenetic race from television 
studios to the halls of congress from radio booths to white house 
offices such was arads visibility that one senior white house 
official suggested he switch jobs and become a media star 
we mounted a paramount information campaign said the 
softspoken envoy who has represented his country in washington for 
the past two years which have been some of the most turbulent in 
the 40yearold relationship between the two allies 
by satellite from jerusalem telefax machines in washington and 
airwaves around the united states israeli officials sought to 
deflect accusations made privately by some administration 
officials and publicly by senate minority leader bob dole that 
israels kidnapping of a lebanese cleric was a cavalier act that 
endangered american hostages in lebanon 
we acted in a coordinated fashion in a widesweeping and 
intensive way we were all mobilized in this campaign arad said 
the israelis swung into action on monday hours after a group 
calling itself the organization of the oppressed on earth released 
a videotape purporting to show the hanged body of kidnapped marine 
lt col william higgins the iranianbacked shiite moslem group 
said higgins was killed in retaliation for israels july 28 
kidnapping of sheik abdulkarim obeid 
arad appeared on two primetime television news shows that 
evening followed by israeli arab affairs minister ehud olmert from 
jerusalem on abc tvs nightline program arad was up early 
tuesday for a 7 am national public radio program foreign 
minister moshe arens followed minutes later from jerusalem 
appearing on abcs good morning america 
at the embassy meanwhile secretaries were faxing to members of 
congress and the media a list of terrorist acts including car 
bombings and infiltration attempts into israel allegedly planned 
by sheik abdulkarim obeid in his capacity as a leader of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
arens said obeid was directly responsible for the higgins 
kidnapping in lebanon 17 months ago and may also have been 
responsible for his death i think in retrospect we will see that 
we struck a very effective blow against terrorism he said 
on tuesday reactions started coming in the embassy said it 
received 135 calls of which 124 praised israel for its tough 
stance against terrorism a handful were hate calls said one 
staffer 
arad worked the phones too calling dozens of lawmakers to 
explain israels position and elicit their views dole and several 
house members publicly criticized israel for reckless behavior and 
for failing to consult the united states arad conceded that other 
lawmakers and officials held similar views 
it was important to nip that in the bud he said the 
administration initially appeared undecided about whether israel 
should or shouldnt be blamed he said 
indeed while white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was careful 
on monday not to criticize israels actions he also told reporters 
that it is fair to say that many people do share the senators 
doles concern 
by wednesday people were talking about what the united states 
should do to save the hostages not who it should blame arad 
said 
israel a nation of 43 million isolated among hostile arab 
nations is highly sensitive to its image abroad it long enjoyed 
virtual blanket approval from the us government and the american 
public but both have adopted a more questioning attitude in recent 
years 
crises in relations with its main financial backer and 
diplomatic ally highlight israelis feelings that the world ignores 
the arab threat to their security and treats them according to a 
double standard 
israel is in a war fighting against an enemy that doesnt 
play by the norms and rules that the west shares put otherwise 
you cant wear kid gloves in a brass knuckle neighborhood said 
harry wall director of the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
in israel 
by thursday israel had placed a whole new construction on its 
kidnapping of obeid 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the issue of the 16 american 
and european hostages held in lebanon by shadowy shiite moslem 
groups had been swept under the rug for a long time until 
israel revived it with the obeid abduction 
rabin said he hoped israels action would not only capture the 
headlines but also bring about the captives freedom

the soviet union on saturday portrayed a gloomy 
picture of an economy sliding toward disaster with a national debt 
of nearly 500 billion and growing faster than that of the united 
states 
the revelation was made in a speech by state planning committee 
chairman yuri maslyukov to the supreme soviet or legislature 
despite the dismal prognosis maslyukovs speech was markedly 
different from previous statements by soviet economic authorities 
in that he acknowledged some key problems and outlined ways to 
solve them 
the proposals likely will be taken up by the supreme soviet when 
it considers the 1990 budget in a session that begins sept 25 
human rights activist andrei sakharov speaking in the united 
states last week reported the latest sad joke the difference 
between an optimist and a pessimist he said depends on whether a 
person expects economic disaster to strike the soviet union in one 
two or five years 
soviet stores are expected to become even more barren because 
wages now are rising twice as fast as the production of consumer 
goods according to maslyukovs figures imports alone are not the 
answer he said 
no foreign uncle is going to solve this problem for us he 
warned 
inflationary pressures are growing and the deficit for 1989 is 
now projected at 192 billion up 20 percent from estimates given 
six months ago 
that is four times more than the us budget deficit in terms of 
the economys ability to adjust to it the soviet deficit amounts 
to 138 percent of all the countrys goods and services produced in 
a year 
in november finance minister boris gostev made world headlines 
by admitting to a budget deficit for the first time but his figure 
hid twothirds of the deficit with bookkeeping tricks 
in his speech made friday and reported saturday by pravda 
maslyukov called for an end to such smoke screens he proposed 
issuing government bonds to cover the deficit and paying interest 
to savers 
that would sop up some of the publics extra cash which it is 
now trying to spend on inadequate supplies of consumer goods 
maslyukov said 
we must stop the worsening of the economic situation and 
social tension he said hundreds of thousands of soviet miners 
went on strike in july in part because of shortages of housing and 
simple goods like soap and meat 
in 1990 the government plans for consumer goods production to 
grow 11 times faster than heavy industry he said already this 
year government investment in factories and machinery has dropped 
by 30 percent he said 
that would be a dramatic turnaround for the soviet government 
which has traditionally emphasized heavy industry and defense at 
the expense of housing and consumer goods 
but even maslyukovs promised doubling and tripling of the 
growth rates for manufacturing of televisions and washing machines 
will meet just a tiny fraction of the demand 
for example the growth rate for television manufacturing will 
triple bringing total production to 106 million sets a year for 
a population of 287 million 
maslyukov said the deficit could be cut in half next year by 
reducing the losses at state enterprises and trimming defense 
spending and government investment in industry

coal miners in the far northern vorkuta region 
walked off their jobs saturday but then agreed that government 
concessions are generous enough to keep them at work at least until 
next year official reports said 
the tass news agency said thousands of miners shut down 11 of 13 
mines in the coalrich pechora field north of the arctic circle but 
agreed to start working again at midnight after officials explained 
concessions included in a government decree 
at a joint conference representatives of mines and 
enterprises of the town unanimously decided to stop the strike 
until jan 1 1990 and to start working from midnight state tv 
reported it did not say what would happen after the first of the 
year 
workers decided friday to stay off the job until they received 
the full text of a government decree that officials say fulfills 
promises made to end a wave of strikes last month 
the promises included bonuses for night work and for miners who 
use dangerous equipment and better pension and overtime benefits 
the government also made general pledges to improve housing and end 
shortages of food and consumer goods 
a spokesman at the organizational department of the local 
communist party headquarters said in a telephone interview that 
alexander tsuryupa a director of the state enterprise that 
operates all 13 mines brought a copy of the decree from moscow 
1100 miles to the southwest and explained it to the workers 
saturday 
the miners then held a closed meeting to decide whether to go 
back to work said the official who declined to identify himself 
emotions have stabilized and now there are no outbursts he 
said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev called last months 
strikes by hundreds of thousands of coal miners the greatest trial 
of his 4 years in power he sympathized with the workers but urged 
them to return to their jobs 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov told the official media friday that 
the settlement with the miners would cost about 32 billion 
he said it would be difficult for the government to come up with 
the money and told other workers that if they strike they will hurt 
only themselves 
if we follow the road of strikes no one will benefit from it 
and lowpaid sections of the population will be hit first he 
said in a television interview 
the vorkuta miners first struck july 19 several days after 
thousands of miners in other parts of the soviet union already had 
walked out they demanded better living and working conditions and 
that the government pay more attention to the problems of workers 
in the far north they returned to work after about a week 
workers in the kuzbass area of siberia where the strikes began 
conducted a twohour warning strike thursday because they said the 
government is not living up to its promise to shut down a 
hydroelectric project the miners say is damaging the environment

the pain wont end for thomas cicippio until 
his brother joseph and all the other hostages in lebanon come home 
but even after an agonizing week in which his brother was under 
a death sentence by his moslem captors for several days cicippio 
is certain the hostages will be freed one day 
i think if the us and all of the other governments would 
stick together now im sure theyll be able to end the hostage 
situation thomas cicippio said friday from norristown 
he said his family planned to spend the weekend trying to get 
their lives back on an even keel after a week in which another us 
hostage was reported hanged four deadlines for josephs death were 
set and then canceled his wife made an extraordinary plea for her 
husbands safety and joseph appealed in a videotape for the 
release of a lebanese clergyman seized by israel last month 
life must go on thomas cicippio said of course we 
always think about joseph theres no way you can do anything 
without thinking about joe 
joseph cicippio was on his way to work as acting comptroller of 
the american university in beirut when he was kidnapped sept 12 
1986 
on monday the revolutionary justice organization said it would 
kill him if israel did not free sheik abdul karim obeid the shiite 
moslem spiritual leader israeli commandos captured in lebanon on 
july 28 
the threat to cicippio came shortly after another proiranian 
group claimed it had hanged marine lt col william r higgins in 
retaliation for israels action a videotape that seemed to show 
the body of higgins hanging from a noose was issued but no body 
has been found and some reports have said he was killed months ago 
elham ghandour cicippio whom joseph married in 1985 pleaded 
tuesday for the captors to review their consciences and stop from 
carrying out the killing 
the captors first deadline 11 am edt tuesday was pushed 
back four hours and then until thursday the captors said they were 
responding to friendly appeals and the plea from mrs cicippio 
by thursday when the new deadline approached scores of 
journalists were trampling the lawn outside thomas cicippios 
suburban splitlevel home early in the day it was extended three 
hours and a videotaped message with joseph cicippio urging obeids 
release was made public in beirut 
just before 2 pm the captors said they had called off the 
killing and replaced it with demands that israel free palestinian 
and lebanese prisoners they said they would provide a list to the 
red cross 
the news made the cicippio family jubilant we were all so 
extremely happy thomas cicippio said it was just a case of 
joy and tears and kisses and hugs and everything else 
but he stressed that the familys ordeal wont end even if his 
brother is freed 
what it would really take is not only to have joseph knock on 
my front door but to have all of the hostages be able to go home 
and knock on their own front door he said we cant forget the 
rest of the hostages theyre all a part of us now 
most of all id like to see lt col higgins come back and be 
able to knock on his front door cicippio said i have a 
feeling that the colonel is still alive 
not counting higgins 16 westerners including eight americans 
are believed to be held captive in lebanon held longest is terry 
a anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press who was seized march 16 1985 
cicippio said he felt no rancor toward his brothers captors 
joseph is still alive he said if he wasnt alive it may 
be a different story all of the other american hostages as far as 
i know are still alive so theres no way i can say i hate them 
and cicippio said he didnt mind what the journalists had done 
to his lawn 
perhaps they can all come back tomorrow and retrample it he 
said i dont care if we have twice as many people come that is 
if we get word that joseph is free

this moslem arab country has combined 
strong revolutionary credentials good western contacts and deft 
diplomacy to forge a reputation as a successful mediator of hostage 
crises 
it counts among its negotiating coups the release in january 
1981 of americans who were held hostage at the us embassy in iran 
this north african countrys envoys are once again playing the 
role of mediator this time in the hostage crisis in lebanon 
algeria is no stranger to that countrys turmoil though 
algerias exact role never has been spelled out french officials 
thanked the nation publicly after french hostages were released by 
proiranian groups in lebanon in 19871988 
we have a skill that we put at the disposal of the 
international community the algerian ambassador to washington 
mohammed sahnoun told reporters in april 1988 he spoke after 
shiite moslem hijackers of a kuwaiti jetliner gave up the plane in 
algeria and were apparently allowed to escape 
sahnoun said he could not provide details of the agreement 
because it would break algerias word to the hijackers and damage 
its chances of helping in such situations in the future 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain and former secretary 
of state george shultz criticized the decision to release the 
kuwaiti hijackers who killed two passengers 
in response algeria rejected what it called an effort to 
fling discredit on an action which saved precious human lives from 
murderous violence 
perhaps the most prominent algerian success came jan 20 1981 
when american hostages held 444 days in tehran stepped off an 
airliner at the algiers airport 
iran and the united states had cut a deal after months of 
mediation by algerian diplomats 
a happy ending might change the american view that we are 
communists a senior algerian official said at the time 
after a war with france that led to independence in 1962 
algeria pursued socialist policies and shaped close ties with the 
soviet union and radical moslem groups 
while algeria is often in clear sympathy with the aims of 
radical organizations it has steered clear of supporting terrorist 
tactics 
in october 1977 algerian officials negotiated at the foot of a 
japanese dc8 hijacked by guerrillas from a group known as the red 
army the algerians helped win freedom for hostages in exchange for 
a 6 million ransom and the release of six of the militants 
comrades in japanese jails 
in this case the hijackers also were apparently allowed to 
leave algeria

the proiranian extremist group hezbollah 
on saturday named five palestinians and lebanese whom it said 
israel should release along with an abducted moslem cleric 
hezbollah also denied holding any negotiations on a possible 
prisoner exchange with israel 
the shiite moslem organization was reacting to israels july 28 
abduction from lebanon of sheik abdul karim obeid israel has said 
it will trade the cleric whom it links to terrorism and up to 60 
other shiites for three israeli prisoners and the 17 foreigners 
held in lebanon 
hezbollah said the abduction of obeid has blocked chances for 
a swap but it also said israel should free sheik obeid first 
one shiite group in lebanon claimed it killed a us marine it 
held hostage in retaliation for obeids abduction a second group 
threatened to kill another american but later said it had issued a 
reprieve 
hezbollahs statement came the same day a ranking maronite 
catholic bishop crossed into beiruts moslem sector to meet with 
hezbollahs spiritual guide sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
bishop khalil abinadir told reporters he carried a message from 
pope john paul ii asking that the body of the marine lt col 
william higgins be returned to his family 
hezbollah has demanded that israel release the cleric in 
addition to palestinians jailed during the antiisraeli uprising in 
the occupied lands and captured guerrillas 
the statement issued saturday listed the five detainees as the 
uprising heroes nidal zaloum itaf alyan and abdulhadi 
suleiman ghanem and the lebanese resistance heroes anwar yaseen 
and soha bishara 
it quoted an unidentified responsible source in hezbollah as 
saying we are as eager to obtain their release as much as we 
are eager to obtain the release of the detainees who belong to the 
sons of hezbollah 
zaloum stabbed two israelis to death in jerusalem and ghanem 
carried out an attack on a bus ms alyan was arrested before she 
could carry out a bombing in august 1987 
yaseen was arrested and accused of preparing an attack on 
israels selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
ms bishara shot and wounded maj gen antoine lahd commander 
of the israelibacked south lebanon army militia on nov 7 in 
south lebanon 
despite public disclaimers hezbollah is widely believed to be 
the umbrella for shiite moslem factions holding most of the 16 
western hostages in lebanon 
hezbollah said lists of other prisoners it wants released will 
be prepared within days and presented to the red cross 
the chief delegate of the international committee of the red 
cross in lebanon michel dufour told the associated press on 
saturday that his group had not been approached

a scholarship fund started for lt col 
william higgins daughter has gotten an unexpectedly widespread 
response with 10000 in pledges organizers said 
the people who cant afford to give are giving said pat 
mullen a lawyer who served with higgins in the marines in the late 
60s the most important ones are the 5 and 10 contributors 
who are not marines 
higgins 44 was in lebanon serving as part of an international 
peacekeeping force when he was taken hostage in february 1988 
on monday his captors released a videotape that seemed to show 
higgins hanging from a noose saying he had been killed in 
retaliation for the israelis seizure the previous week of a shiite 
moslem cleric us officials have speculated that higgins actually 
was killed some time earlier 
mullen and dallas businessman schuyler page another former 
marine originally intended to gather enough money to assist 
higgins 19yearold daughter christine a student at james 
madison university in virginia 
but mullen said friday that the total had already hit 10000 
and may grow large enough to set up an endowment to help other 
dependents of people killed during military service 
with the public response i dont think its inconceivable 
that we can raise over 100000 which will allow us to do more in 
colonel higgins name he said 
page and mullen were classmates with higgins in an officer 
training course and after it ended in november 1967 they served 
in vietnam 
defense department spokeswoman maj kathy wood said people who 
know higgins continue to hope that he is not dead she said miss 
higgins learned of the scholarship fund friday and was touched by 
the effort

for a few moments a beverly hills 
fundraising dinner looked like the good old days before mayor tom 
bradleys fifth term turned into a tangle of investigations that 
cut into his reputation of integrity 
as bradley took the podium last week in a hotel ballroom 800 
organized labor activists stood and applauded pocket cameras 
flashed busboys turned from clearing tables to catch a look at the 
mayor 
the 71yearold bradley was in characteristic form tall and 
athletic like the ucla track star he used to be his voice deep and 
monotone as he delivered a speech praising organized labor 
the mayor gave no clue of the problems dogging the fifth term he 
won in april the allegations of conflict of interest and 
influence peddling accusations of coverup and speculation that he 
may resign 
city attorney james hahn is probing among other things the 
mayors ties to two financial institutions that paid bradley while 
doing business with the city 
bradley who denies any wrongdoing said friday he has 
established an account for supporter contributions to cover his 
legal expenses 
hahns probe expected to be completed by midseptember hangs 
over city hall 
all conversations begin with a discussion of this its the 
first thing people say as they shake your hand said joy picus a 
member of the city council 
shortly before the election newspaper reports said the city 
treasurer directed the deposit of 2 million in a bank paying 
18000 to the mayor to act as adviser 
the deposit was made in far east national bank on the day the 
mayor called treasurer leonard rittenberg and one day after the 
mayor spoke with the bank president about the citys failure to 
renew a 1 million certificate of deposit 
rittenberg denied the mayor influenced him and the mayor denied 
any wrongdoing bradley returned the 18000 and made it through 
the election barely avoiding a runoff 
but questions persisted 
an official in the treasurers office testified before a city 
council committee that his two bosses including rittenberg tried 
to cover up the mayors role in the far east deposit an allegation 
rittenberg denies 
the official george sehlmeyer said a city form was doctored so 
that the notation per the mayor next to the far east deposit 
record was covered with correction fluid 
i was stunned to hear the mayor was even involved said 
sehlmeyer 
other probes of bradley include 
a cityfunded africa task force whose executive director 
juanita st john is involved in a lucrative real estate deal with 
the mayor 
ms st john has been charged with misdemeanor failure to comply 
with a subpoena after refusing to turn over documents on 180000 
in task force checks written to herself or for cash 
the justice department is looking into whether investment 
banking firm drexel burnham lambert gave the mayor favorable 
treatment in stock deals in exchange for favored treatment by the 
city 
the us securities and exchange commission is reviewing 
whether bradleys stock and bond trades were tainted by insider 
trading 
walter zelman executive director of the political watchdog 
group common cause said that bradleys acceptance of money from 
far east was pretty unusual and pretty blatant and a really 
serious mistake 
the mayor also was hired by valley federal savings amp loan to act 
as adviser while that institution was doing business with the city 
if bradley did use his influence to direct city dollars to the 
institutions he could face criminal charges said zelman 
but until the city attorney completes his investigation many 
city officials and business leaders refuse to speculate about the 
mayor 
everyone is entitled to a fair hearing said councilman nate 
holden who opposed bradley in the last election you dont jump 
up and down on a guy just because hes been accused 
but even the mayors supporters said they have found it hard to 
believe he would work for a bank that was doing business with the 
city 
in all the years ive known him ive never known him before 
these matters came up to be anything but completely honest and 
forthright said councilwoman joan milke flores in that way 
its a surprise that he would even allow these things to happen

to confiscate videotape from one television station attempted to

iran said saturday it has refused to 
accept a message from president bush about the foreign hostages in 
lebanon but a un spokesman working on the issue talked of 
optimism in the air 
in washington a government source said the bush administration 
had succeeded in communicating with iran which is believed to have 
strong influence over groups holding hostages 
algeria assumed a leading role in efforts to win release of the 
captives 
the proiranian group hezbollah believed to be the umbrella for 
factions holding hostages named five prisoners held in israel that 
it wants released in addition to a shiite moslem cleric kidnapped 
by israel 
the statement indirectly endorsed demands made thursday by the 
revolutionary justice organization after it suspended threats to 
kill american hostage joseph cicippio 
israel said it was exploring all ways of winning freedom for 
hostages but would not engage in public debate on the demands 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted an 
unidentified foreign ministry official as saying the us 
administration sent a message to irans foreign ministry last week 
through a third country since the content had nothing to do with 
iran the message was not accepted 
iran has denied involvement in hostagetaking 
the agency monitored in nicosia said the official was 
responding to reports that bush sent a message to iran to prevent 
the killing of hostages it gave no further details 
a closely involved source in washington said on condition of 
anonymity basically weve been trying to get different people 
to weigh in 
we have been able to get our messages one way or another 
through to the parties certainly to the iranians the source 
said 
irans new president hashemi rafsanjani on friday offered to 
help solve the hostage problem 
however he said the united states must pressure israel to free 
sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem clergyman abducted july 28 
from south lebanon 
on monday a proiranian group said it hanged an american 
hostage marine lt col william r higgins in retaliation for 
israels refusal to free obeid revolutionary justice then 
threatened to kill cicippio but said thursday it was freezing 
the order while demanding freedom for obeid and palestinian and 
lebanese prisoners in israel 
israel has accused obeid of instigating attacks on israel and 
has offered to free him only if the foreign hostages and three 
israeli soldiers held in lebanon are freed 
in israel prime minister yitzhak shamirs top aide yossi 
ahimeir said israels original offer stands and that the country 
refuses to engage in a public debate over hezbollah demands 
we are holding contacts and making efforts to bring about the 
release of hostages and prisoners and its not worthwhile to add 
any details now he said 
there are 16 foreigners including eight americans held in 
lebanon the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
in damascus syria the head of un peacekeeping operations 
marrack goulding told a news conference there was optimism in 
the air in beirut about the release of hostages 
but he warned there would be no quick fixes no simple 
solution 
goulding arrived in syria from lebanon where he was 
investigating the killing of higgins who was working with a un 
observer force when he was abducted in february 1988 
after three days of discussions in beirut goulding said he had 
not yet obtained concrete proof that colonel higgins is dead and 
i pray he is not dead 
us officials have said they are virtually certain higgins is 
dead 
goulding also told reporters algeria is playing an extra part 
in trying to resolve the hostage problem as algeria has done in 
previous cases 
the north african country which has strong ties to both the 
west and radical moslem groups has successfully mediated hostage 
crises in the past 10 years algerian diplomats helped win the 
release of american hostages in january 1981 after they were held 
444 days at the us embassy in iran 
algerias ambassador to beirut khaled hasnawi was quoted 
saturday by beirut radio stations as saying his country was 
undertaking a new initiative to free all hostages 
radio algiers said his talks involved all hostages whether 
lebanese palestinians americans europeans or israelis it 
cited progress in this mediation 
several beirut radio stations said bush had specifically asked 
algeria to intercede 
a hezbollah statement issued in beirut on saturday demanded 
freedom from israeli prisons of five uprising heroes 
identified as nidal zaloum itaf alyan and abdulhadi suleiman 
ghanem and lebanese resistance heroes anwar yaseen and soha 
bishara 
it also demanded israel release obeid palestinians jailed 
during the antiisraeli uprising in the occupied territories and 
guerrillas it has captured

syria sent tanks and rocket launchers to 
the edge of the citys christian sector saturday indicating it may 
be preparing to invade or fend off a christian assault police said 
the artillery movement followed a savage shelling duel on 
residential neighborhoods that killed 21 people and wounded 82 
police said they said 10 of the victims died when mortar shells 
hit an underground shelter 
the christian voice of lebanon called it a shelling storm 
among the dead were seven soldiers serving under christian army 
commander gen michel aoun who also heads the christian half of 
this nations divided government 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
rules said it was not clear if the syrian reinforcements are a 
prelude to storming the christian sector or facing an invasion by 
aouns forces 
the movement could also be intended as a show of force 
both sectors of the city have been buzzing with rumors that 
aouns forces were planning to storm moslem west beirut in an 
effort to drive out the syrians and seize lebanons central bank 
it contains the nations currency reserves 
aoun who sparked the current round of fighting 20 weeks ago by 
blockading militiarun ports has vowed to force the syrians out of 
lebanon the syrians arrived under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but aoun says they betrayed that mandate by siding with 
moslem militias in the civil war 
the spokesman said the tanks mostly sovietdesigned t62s 
rolled down the central lebanese mountains from east lebanons 
bekaa valley clogging traffic along the beirutdamascus highway 
they took up positions on hills overlooking christian east 
beirut as well as the threemile green line that splits the city 
into moslem and christian zones the spokesman said 
dozens of multibarreled rocket launchers which fire 40 rockets 
a minute were deployed in several poor neighborhoods along the 
moslem side of the line 
earlier saturday a sixhour barrage took casualties in beirut 
the surrounding mountain villages and the bekaa valley according 
to the police spokesman 
a reliable christian source said seven of those killed in the 
shelter beneath a residential building in the christian suburb of 
fayadiyeh were lebanese army soldiers 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
targeted building was used by aouns army as a communications 
station aouns command refused comment on the report 
the shelter was hit by three 240mm mortar shells fired from a 
syrian emplacement in baaleshmeieh a few miles east of fayadiyeh 
the shells pierced the parking lot of the 10story building and 
blasted the shelter he said causing part of the building to 
collapse and burying the victims 
aouns command at the defense ministry in the suburb of yarze 
15 miles east of fayadiyeh sent hundreds of soldiers to evacuate 
casualties from the collapsed shelter the police spokesman said 
he said casualties were taken away in armored personnel carriers 
because it was very risky for ambulances to operate due to the 
intensity of the barrage 
at peak times of the duel according to the spokesman 60 shells 
per minute were being fired he said the two sides fired about 
10000 shells and rockets in the exchange 
by police count the 20weekold confrontation between aouns 
20000 mainly christian troops and the 40000 syrian soldiers in 
lebanon has killed 537 people and wounded 2266 
moslems are fighting for a greater share of power in lebanon 
which has been controlled by the christian minority 
the latest duel began late friday and sent civilians fleeing to 
basements and underground shelters it escalated sharply after the 
syrians hit the shelter the spokesman said 
aouns gunners and their rightwing christian allies the 
lebanese forces militia entrenched in lebanons 310squaremile 
christian enclave responded heavily the spokesman said 
christian militia gunners sprayed residential districts in west 
beirut and other moslem areas with grad missiles from rocket 
launchers according to the spokesman 
he said the 122mm projectiles left gaping holes in apartment 
buildings shattering walls and glass and starting several fires 
syrian gunners manning howitzer emplacements along west 
beiruts seaside boulevard responded by firing on residential 
distriacts in east beirut 
the exchanges spread to moslem druse and christian mountains 
south and northeast of the capital 
aouns gunners also shelled the bekaa valley town of chtoura 
which commands the syrian armys supply routes from damascus the 
police spokesman said

in amarillo texas said thieves have been stealing saddles for 
years 
a custom built saddle can easily run 2000 he said and 
depending on who makes it it can be two three times that you 
take a 2000 saddle and it would not be hard to get 500 for it 
real quick

plymouth rock which attracts 1 million 
tourists a year has started to crack open along the same line 
where a 1774 split was repaired in 1880 
tourists arent likely to notice the crack but state officials 
are worried they have approached local and state historical groups 
to coordinate the preservation of the rock 
its not a major task and its not expensive but its just 
such a very important landmark we dont want to create any waves 
said donald matinzi superintendent of pilgrim memorial state park 
for the state department of environmental management 
waves crashing over the rock on the beach at plymouth harbor are 
just what have caused the old mortar to erode and the rock to 
crack in the 1880 repair job the pieces never quite fit and the 
cement line was always visible 
the rock weighs about six tons and is about 14 feet wide and 6 
feet long 
matinzis plan involves digging out the sand to expose the total 
rock and then adding new mortar to hold the two pieces together 
the poor rock has gotten knocked around so much and it gets 
covered every tide said carolyn travers a research librarian at 
plimoth plantation which uses an old spelling of plymouth if 
they dont do something the froth will get in and split it 
legend and some historians have it that the first pilgrim 
landing party used the rock to step ashore in december 1620 
in december wading is not high on the list of things to do 
said laurence pizer director of the pilgrim society the 
interest of the pilgrims was to find a place to get off at a 
relatively high spot and there was no other obvious landing spot 
for several hundred feet north or south 
the rocks troubles began when the sons of liberty decided to 
move it to the town square in 1774 the rock was dropped and 
broken so they left twothirds behind on the beach and moved 
onethird to town but tourists kept chipping away at the smaller 
piece so in 1880 it was taken back where it came from and the two 
sections patched together 
the crack wasnt all bad at the time it occurred locals saw 
the break as symbolic of the split between the colonies and great 
britain

george bush had watched a hostage crisis help 
destroy one president and ensnarl another in scandal so he knew 
full well he was plunging into highrisk territory when terrorists 
claimed to have killed one american and set an execution date for 
another in lebanon 
for the first six months of his presidency bush had been 
largely spared from any pressures over the hostages plight even 
though nine americans remained in captivity in lebanon 
that suddenly changed after israeli commandos seized a shiite 
moslem cleric in lebanon three days later a shadowy organization 
called the organization of the oppressed on earth declared it had 
hanged marine lt col william r higgins and released a videotape 
purportedly showing the execution 
suddenly bush began to feel the sting of experiences that had 
bludgeoned jimmy carter and ronald reagan bush spoke of the 
overwhelming events of the hostage crisis and commented these 
are not easy days 
bush was spending the weekend with family at the presidential 
retreat at camp david md while national security aides monitored 
the hostage developments at the white house 
the president did not have any policy staff with him and the 
hostage situation was considered stabilized white house 
spokesman jay allison said saturday 
he said bush did routine paperwork received intelligence 
briefing materials and made phone calls during the morning then 
played tennis and went swimming 
back in washington us officials sought to downplay any 
negative interpretation of the iranian news agency report on iran 
refusing a us message last week 
basically weve been trying to get different people to weigh 
in said one closely involved source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity we have been able to get our messages one way or 
another through to the parties certainly to the iranians 
it was last week with telephone calls to world leaders on 
behalf of the hostages when bush initiated what his press 
secretary marlin fitzwater called the most defined and 
highlevel diplomatic effort i have ever seen in the bush and 
reagan administrations 
complaining of inadequate intelligence from lebanon bush 
anguished with a heavy heart for four days over higgins and 
awaited word on hostage joseph cicippio under a death threat from 
the radical revolutionary justice organization 
after a long suspense as the white house waged its intense 
diplomatic effort and the pentagon put on a display of military 
muscle in the middle east cicippio got a temporary reprieve from 
his captors 
no one knew for sure why cicippios sentenced was suspended i 
like to think that a broadspread appeal to nations in every corner 
of the globe had something to do with it bush said 
the outcome spared bush at least temporarily from pressure 
to find an appropriate way to punish the terrorists without 
endangering the remaining hostages or innocent civilians 
even so bush said friday i feel the burden of going to every 
end possible to try to find get the return of these americans to 
their loved ones and find out the truth about col higgins 
such a burden can be perilous to presidents 
carters white house became branded as a presidency held hostage 
by the 441day captivity of americans in iran and the ordeal 
including a disastrous rescue attempt helped drive him from office 
for reagan the kidnapping of americans in lebanon led the white 
house into the improbable irancontra affair with embarrassing 
revelations about criminal wrongdoing and clumsy attempts to trade 
arms for hostages 
william schneider a political analyst at the american 
enterprise institute a conservative think tank said bush looked 
the same way all presidents look when they get to a hostage crisis 
he looked ineffectual and the united states look helpless 
hes under pressure to do something and theres nothing he can 
do schneider said he rediscovered a lesson he should have 
learned to resist the temptation to allow these things to 
become a serious national crisis because you cannot control 
events 
on the other hand stephen hess a presidential scholar at the 
brookings institution said bush had performed well 
hes a naturally cautious man and this is one of those times 
when it was probably useful said hess he said bush had learned 
from the experiences of carter and reagan 
with the announcement of higgins death bush cut short a 
speechmaking trip in the west and rushed back to washington 
hurriedly ordered a meeting monday with military diplomatic and 
national security advisers and then delivered a briefing to 
congressional leaders 
highranking pentagon officials were seen entering the white 
house carrying large charts and maps giving rise to speculation 
that a military strike was being planned 
nothing happened after the apparent shift to a crisis mode 
at the tuesday morning meeting of top white house aides chief 
of staff john sununu emphasized the limitations bush faced in 
trying to employ military options 
stephen studdert a highranking aide described bush as 
outraged incensed but cognizant of the limitations on his 
options and the need to be responsible 
bush himself acknowledged in a 1986 report on terrorism that 
retaliation was not an easy course our principles of justice 
will not permit random retaliation against groups of countries 
the report said 
the white house began to reverse course there was no crisis and 
the government was not being immobilized by terrorists press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
bush went ahead with a festive barbecue on the south lawn 
tuesday night 
with the immediate crisis behind him bush said he wanted to 
follow up an offer from irans new president hashemi rafsanjani 
to help find a solution to the hostage crisis there also were 
intriguing clues that the soviet union and syria had been helpful 
fitzwater said the united states hoped last weeks developments 
may open up some opportunity for improvement over the long haul 
i dont think were back at square one

the following is a translation by the 
associated press of the arab text of a statement issued saturday by 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
the statement quoted an unidentified responsible source at 
the party as saying 
since the entity of zionist terrorism committed the crime of 
kidnapping the imam of jibchit struggling sheik abdul karim obeid 
and his two relatives and the ensuing repercussions and global 
reactions that cornered the criminal zionists in an impasse this 
entity has tried to cover up its terrorist act and big crime which 
violated the security and sovereignty of others and played havoc 
with international human ethics values and norms 
so this entity launched what it called readiness to trade the 
israeli prisoners of war and the western hostages for sheik 
obeid and shiite prisoners in the jails of zionist occupation 
it also returned today to propagate anew that negotiations 
with hezbollah in this regard were possible 
we assert that hezbollah has nothing to do at all with the 
hostage issue or any negotiations related to this matter this 
issue concerns the kidnappers only everybody knows this by now and 
knows the way to them kidnappers if they wanted to 
regarding the prisoners any discussion is out of the 
question the zionist entity has to understand it has miscalculated 
and that the abduction of sheik abdul karim obeid has blocked 
chances for a swap 
therefore the zionist enemy should free sheik obeid first and 
not promise itself and public opinion with what is impossible in 
light of the crime it has committed 
we are very eager to release all the lebanese and palestinian 
mujahedeen holy warriors in the prisons of the zionist enemy 
irrespective of their sects and affiliations because we consider 
that any prisoner with the zionists belongs to the resistance 
we are as eager to obtain the release of other detainees like 
nidal zaloum itaf aylan and abdul hadi suleiman who belong to the 
uprising heroes and anwar yaseen and soha bishara who belong to 
the heroes of the lebanese resistance as much as we are eager to 
obtain the release of the sons of hezbollah 
what the enemy is trying to leak about the beginning of 
negotiations with hezbollah is a sheer false and baseless rumor 
it is a deceptive attempt to extricate itself from the great 
impasse in which it has fallen as a result of its latest 
foolishness whose consequences it did not foresee it is also part 
of a wicked plan to frustrate the morale of the strugglers of the 
islamic and nationalist resistance in lebanon as well as the 
intefadeh uprising in palestine 
hezbollah

joginder singh grabbed a piece of 
shrapnel from a rocket that tore through his aunts house saturday 
wounding his three young cousins and demanded to know why the 
united states and the soviet union were allowing innocent afghans 
to be hurt and killed 
singhs relatives and the two young children of a neighbor 
playing in the front yard were among the latest victims of the 
rocketing of kabul an almost daily event since late june 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said 13 rockets 
pounded the capital saturday wounding eight people during and 
after his briefing at least four more rockets fell their 
distinctive boom heard across much of the city 
amani said the rockets saturday hit many areas but were 
concentrated around kabuls main grain silo where several hundred 
trucks loaded with wheat from the soviet union were waiting to be 
unloaded 
the rockets missed the silo but one tore into the ground about 
a yard in front of a watchtower on its perimeter breaking the 
towers windows and those of nearby houses 
for the last four or five months amani said usbacked 
guerrillas fighting to oust the sovietbacked government have been 
trying to starve this city by cutting roads and preventing food 
deliveries 
now that they cant cut the roads and all these supplies are 
coming to the city their attack is to destroy what has already 
been delivered it is their aim to impose starvation he said 
the singh family house is about 1 miles from the silo 
the homes metal roof was torn off and a rockets path could be 
traced through twofootwide holes down to the ground floor on the 
second floor where singh said his 16yearold cousin had been 
ironing a pile of newly pressed sheets stained with blood lay in 
the rubble amid twisted fragments of shrapnel and the dusty iron 
the windows in a primary school next to the twostory house were 
shattered 
if the school had been open god knows how many students would 
have been killed singh said the government has extended the 
summer holiday because of rocket attacks 
we think this is a policy of the united states and the soviet 
union they are dividing the world and they are dividing afghan 
brothers the afghan country said singh an afghan of indian 
descent 
if the government cannot protect the people they have no 
right to rule and the united states and the soviet union why are 
they doing this to innocent people what have we done he asked 
according to un sources 281 people were killed and 745 
injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing in kabul from june 25 
to aug 1 virtually all were civilians 
a threeday lull last week was broken friday when 19 rockets 
killed two people and injured nine amani said 
the rebels who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors have claimed responsibility for some rocketing but insist 
they aim at military targets and blame the government for hitting 
civilian targets the government denies it 
amani accused un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar of 
not doing enough to stop gross violations by the united states 
and pakistan of unmediated accords that were supposed to stop 
us arms supplies to the mujahedeen and soviet arms supplies to 
the afghan army 
he welcomed perez de cuellars call friday for a peaceful 
settlement of the 10yearold civil war but said it was not 
enough 
the afghan government hopes perez de cuellar will play a more 
active and more serious role than he has played so far amani 
said noting he has been authorized to visit kabul and islamabad to 
try to end the war

a former alabama policeman who escaped 
from prison 12 years ago while doing time for murder was found in 
texas where hed been living under an assumed name with a 
different wife and children authorities said 
the shortorder cook known for years in san antonio as ben 
francis hurst turned out to be former lt jimmy ray hurst 56 
convicted in 1973 of killing his wifes boyfriend authorities said 
circuit judge william sullivan who sentenced hurst to life in 
prison for shooting charles cooter mann said the alabama 
bureau of investigation told him hursts identity had been 
confirmed through fingerprints 
san antonio police arrested hurst late thursday a little more 
than a week after alabama investigators asked them to watch a house 
from which telephone calls had been placed to his mother julia 
hurst of talladega 
a neighbor said hurst seemed like a model father to the three 
children he adopted when he married estela gonzalez hurst in 1978 
you couldnt think ben would be capable of something like 
that hes very friendly said linda lopez its just 
incredible 
police were uncertain whether his wife knew of hursts past 
she just couldnt believe it when i called her she asked me 
several times if i was lying said detective bob farley the 
hurst family has an unlisted telephone number in san antonio 
hurst and his wife in talladega had five children records show 
it was unclear whether they remained married

not made any effort to change his appearance although he seemed to 
have aged well beyond his years while on the run 
he offered no resistance when confronted outside the dennys 
restaurant where he told officers he had worked for the past eight 
years 
evidence in hursts 1973 trial showed he lured mann 26 to a 
wooded area and shot him in the face hurst had been a fugitive 
since march 1977 when he made his second escape from an alabama 
state prison 
hurst was being held without bond on two fugitive warrants he

secretary of state james a baker iii and 
three other members of president bushs cabinet travel to mexico 
sunday on a visit seen here as a milestone in recently improving 
usmexico relations 
mexican officials say they hope the meeting of the usmexico 
binational commission will ratify the spirit of houston and 
provide a platform for further progress 
aides say bush and president carlos salinas de gortari hit it 
off well at a meeting in november in houston when both were 
presidentselect 
the rank and size of the us delegation alone are a good sign 
for the meeting being held sunday and monday highranking mexican 
officials said on condition their names not be disclosed 
the commission has not met for 2 years although meetings were 
supposed to be held every six months mexican and us officials 
blamed the lapse on an political emphasis last year on presidential 
elections in both nations 
although relations between the salinas and bush administrations 
are going well similar honeymoon periods at the beginning of 
recent mexican presidencies have ended in bitterness recrimination 
and nationalist anger 
in the past we have sometimes had a dialogue of the deaf 
said a top salinas administration official 
the united states is sending baker attorney general richard 
thornburgh treasury secretary nicholas brady and commerce 
secretary robert a mosbacher 
other top officials include fbi director william sessions drug 
enforcement administration head john c lawn environmental 
protection agency chief william reilly and us trade 
representative carla hills 
the mexican delegation will be led by the foreign minister 
fernando solana and five other cabinet ministers chief among them 
treasury secretary pedro aspe 
the participants will discuss everything from border bridges 
to the differences between our legal systems said one mexican 
official 
the top issues will be continuing foreign debt negotiations and 
narcotics trafficking other issues include immigration trade and 
investment pollution and tourism 
the meeting comes only two weeks after mexico reached agreement 
on reducing 53 billion of its debt to foreign banks brady and 
other us officials helped drive the bargain final details 
however still must be worked out 
the deal got a mixed reception in mexico with salinas declaring 
it a triumph and critics saying it didnt do enough 
salinas is trying to revive an economy hurt by six years of 
austerity following the collapse of oil prices in 1982 and he has 
argued that debt reduction is the only way to provide capital for 
investment 
he has liberalized trade laws and taken other steps to enourage 
investment and exports not just from the united states but also 
from countries such as japan and south korea 
although us officials have been pleased by many of salinas 
actions one said theyre not doing this to make us happy 
theyre doing it because they think it will work 
one remaining rub is patent law with us companies complaining 
that mexican companies copy their products without compensation 
but even there officials said progress is being made 
while mexico got help on the debt us officials have been 
effusive in their praise for mexicos efforts to combat drug 
trafficking salinas has cracked down hard arresting top 
traffickers and corrupt officials who had been untouchable for 
years 
mexican officials still argue however that the real problem is 
the demand for drugs in the united states 
mexicans also criticize the us attitude towards mexican 
immigrants who they say are taking jobs americans are unable or 
unwilling to fill 
salinas has run some political risks in appearing to accommodate 
the united states on so many issues few mexicans forget for long 
that half of what was once mexico was conquered or bought by the 
united states 
although mexico is now an urban society and the 13th largest 
industrial nation in the world the psychological problems of us 
condescension and mexican sensitivity can still get in the way of 
normal relations

1974 paz zamora was accused of plotting to overthrow banzers 
government and he was jailed for six months and sent into exile 
banzers decision wednesday to back paz zamora for the 
presidency surprised many bolivians and led to a brief bank run 
with thousands of people forming long lines at banks to withdraw

ural mountains are accustomed to area rivers running black and 
brown from industrial residue

workers volunteered to try to clean one of the most polluted rivers 
and were surprised when they found flakes of yellow metal in the 
grime 
scientists confirmed the flakes were gold and the workers 
combined panning and cleaning 
tass said the workers collected 11 pounds of gold from about a 
mile of the river and the metal was sold by city officials for 
59000 the agency reported the money was used to buy medical 
equipment for the city 
nizhny tagilsk 550 miles east of moscow has a reputation of 
being one of the most polluted cities in the soviet union even

police fired tear gas into a 
church saturday to disperse peaceful mourners at a postfuneral 
ceremony for two black activists killed in a bomb blast a roman 
catholic priest said 
the rev richard orourke said police used dozens of canisters 
of tear gas to break up the traditional postfuneral meal attended 
by about 500 people at st matthews catholic church in 
bonteheuwel a mixedrace area outside cape town 
the people couldnt get out of the church so they broke down 
the emergency doors and came into an adjoining house orourke 
said every time the people tried to go out they were beaten 
back time and time again 
later police fired tear gas on about 50 people trying to visit 
south africas oldest imprisoned activist oscar mpetha who turned 
80 on saturday 
police refused to allow the group into groote schuur hospital in 
cape town where mpetha receives treatment for diabetes he was 
sentenced to five years jail for terrorism in 1985 
in the first incident orourke said police acted without 
provocation from mourners who had come from a joint funeral for 
coline williams 23 and robbie waterwitch 20 
police said there were no arrests or serious injuries but they 
refused to comment further 
ms williams and waterwitch died last month when a bomb they 
were planting in a public toilet exploded prematurely according to 
police 
friends said the two supported the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla movement which is fighting the south african 
government 
one must not be surprised that in the end young people begin 
to think that to plant bombs is the only way to bring change 
said the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches at the funeral 
there have been several bombings in the last two weeks as the 
country prepares for elections sept 6 which exclude the black 
majority under apartheid south african blacks have no voice in 
national affairs the white minority controls the government and 
economy

young people in your dedication to justice and peace caring and 
humanity said anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
about 5000 people attended the funeral service at st marks 
catholic church in the mixedrace township of athlone singing 
freedom songs and waving the banned green gold and black flag of 
the guerrilla organization 
police confiscated flags draped over the two coffins but 
additional flags were smuggled past them at the maitland cemetery 
and placed on the coffins just before the burial 
the 5000 mourners formed one of the largest crowds allowed at a 
funeral for black activists in the past two years

a swimming pool that was offlimits to 
blacks for 34 years reopened saturday to both blacks and whites 
following complaints by a church group 
its about time said bernard daniel a 34yearold black 
man who stopped outside the saluda swim and tennis club on his way 
to a wedding 
few people showed up at the pool despite a temperature of 100 
degrees 
daniel said he and a friend tried to obtain a pool membership 
three years ago but were refused 
i was told it was for white men he recalled nothing was 
done at the time although there were people here who knew it was 
wrong daniel said 
the pool in this town 45 miles south of columbia was closed july 
26 following publicity about the clubs refusal july 13 to admit 
three black youths who were part of a church group that had 
arranged to use the pool 
the land on which the club stands was deeded to the town in 1933 
with the stipulation that it was for the use by the white 
children of the county and town of saluda the stipulation 
remained when the town sold the land to the saluda jaycees for 5 
in 1955 
the swim and tennis club rents the land from the jaycees and 
enforced the rule after the church group complained the jaycees 
ordered the pool closed until it was desegregated 
a few black families purchased halfprice memberships saturday 
but no one was waiting in line when the pool opened about five 
black people swam and about 50 cars stopped so occupants could get 
a glimpse 
janet sibert who is black brought her two children and 
purchased a membership im happy the kids will be able to 
swim said mrs sibert who lives in greenwood about 28 miles 
from saluda 
asked why she brought her children to the saluda pool mrs 
sibert who works in saluda said i think thats obvious we 
were interested and we came 
i want my children to feel good about themselves and know they 
can swim where they want to she said 
robert booth president of the pools sevenmember board of 
directors said he was pleased that the pool opened under the 
desegregation policy 
its going well he said i feel like blacks will start 
coming to the pool 
jamie willis 17 who is white said they probably wouldnt 
they think theyre not wanted there said miss willis who 
was watching and said she was not a club member 
she also said that the 80 seasonal membership fee to belong to 
the swim and tennis club which consists of a wading pool the 
mediumsized swimming pool and two cracked overgrown tennis 
courts might be too expensive for many people in the mostly rural 
town of about 3000 people 
several white high school youths who were sitting in their cars 
by the pool said they didnt want black people there 
i dont know why they want to come here said one 
16yearold boy who would not give his name i dont care if its 
discrimination im not going swimming with them

a federal judge in a ruling that lambasted city 
and federal housing officials said dallas helped create a 
segregated public housing system and must help pay to dismantle it 
in his ruling friday us district judge jerry buchmeyer 
blasted the federal department of housing and urban development 
the city and the dallas housing authority for what he called a 
long unbroken history of segregation in housing 
buchmeyer accused the three of deliberately disrupting plans to 
correct the problem and said he would appoint a special master to 
monitor compliance of a 1987 consent agreement handled in his court 
the undisputed facts establish that the city was a substantial 
cause of deliberate racial segregation and discrimination in its 
public housing programs buchmeyer said 
his ruling added the city to the list of defendants in a 
4yearold desegregation case against the housing authority and 
hud he said he would rule later what financial share the city 
would assume 
seven black women sued in 1985 contending that thousands of 
federally assisted apartments in dallas were segregated by race and 
unequal in conditions because of a longstanding pattern of 
discrimination by hud and the city housing authority 
the judge approved a settlement in january 1987 requiring 
demolition of most of the dilapidated west dallas housing project 
and relocation of tenants to private rentsubsidized apartments 
throughout dallas and the suburbs 
another part of his friday ruling could have the effect of 
freeing up an estimated 3 million in federal funds for the 
demolitions the funds were frozen by an amendment written by a 
texas congressman to a hud appropriations bill 
buchmeyer found that mayor annette strauss and other city 
officials have chosen to ignore the 1987 decree 
attorneys for the plaintiffs said buchmeyers ruling would lead 
to improvements for thousands of poor families living in federally 
financed slums 
its the first time a city has been ordered to join with a 
housing authority to desegregate its housing said attorney mike 
daniel and its the first time a city has been ordered to fund 
the remedies for the separate and unequal conditions it helped 
create 
its fantastic said mary dews one of the plaintiffs in the 
case who has lived in subsidized housing for 20 years 
theres a lot of people who say racism doesnt exist in 
dallas but this shows that it does she said 
mrs strauss contacted friday while vacationing in california 
would not comment on the ruling on the advice of the city attorney 
until the city council could be briefed 
we have to hear what the attorney will recommend mrs 
strauss said until we know that we dont do anything 
assistant city attorney donald postell declined to comment as 
did attorneys for the housing authority and hud 
buchmeyer ruled unconstitutional a 1988 amendment by us rep 
martin frost dtexas it prohibits use of federal money for 
demolition of any of the nearly 3500 apartments at the west dallas 
project 
under the courtapproved settlement 839 apartments in the west 
dallas project were to be renovated and the rest demolished 
residents could seek alternate privately owned housing with 
federal rentsubsidy certificates the cost of the demolition was 
estimated at 20000 per unit 
buchmeyer said the frost amendment was unconstitutional because 
it violated separation of powers 
frost said he felt the housing should be renovated rather than 
razed

a texas woman says the lone star states 
official mammal and unofficial roadside distraction the armadillo 
could solve a flap over license plates 
margaret knox told the texas highway commission that it should 
dump plans to put the friendship state on texas license plates 
and choose instead plates shaped like armadillos 
between the numbers and letters on the plate would be a star 
representing texas standing as the lone star state 
i think its very realistic it would be real neat mrs 
knox 64 said saturday 
since unveiling the design for the friendship state plate 
last month the highway department has been flooded with complaints 
from people saying the slogan doesnt fit the spirit of texas 
politicians have entered the controversy saying the slogan is 
wimpy 
if you have to advertise that youre friendly forget it 
mrs knox said i think its terrible 
she got the idea for the armadillo plate six years ago on a 
canadian trip when she saw a license plate for the northwest 
territories shaped like a polar bear it was striking she said

between the baby bottle and the brown 
bag there were lunch boxes 
they were the first status symbols said scott bruce 34 
who has stirred the interest of baby boomers with a string of 
enterprises celebrating that old schoolyard standard in all its 
glorious incarnations 
that barbie doll box bought at the dime store for 349 back 
somewhere in the mid1970s can fetch hundreds of dollars at auction 
these days bruce collects and resells them 
the beatles the jetsons mickey mouse howdy doody and even 
yesteryears teen idol bobby sherman are also among the bluechip 
boxes most highly prized by people generally between the age of 25 
and 40 bruce said 
about 120 million lunch boxes were sold in their heyday between 
1950 and 1970 so according to bruces calculations every baby 
boomer carried at least one sometimes two to school each year 
by the end of the 1950s there were four competing lunchbox 
companies bruce said kids had a choice of models that 
reflected their personalities sort of like an automobile 
showroom 
now lunch boxes are available only in plastic the last steel 
version featuring rambo was pressed in 1987 phasing out the 
metal models more than a decade after a mother whose son got struck 
in the head with one brought and won a lawsuit banning them in 
florida 
bruce saw the ban coming he knew it was only a matter of time 
before baby boomers in search of nostalgia created a demand 
he spent about 10000 on his entire collection of 1500 boxes 
and thermoses a fifth of which he recently auctioned for 17000

the national womens political caucus 
will concentrate next year on electing abortionrights candidates 
in key states across the nation the groups leader said saturday 
the campaign called empower america will target races in 
oregon arizona colorado nevada south dakota wisconsin ohio 
north carolina maryland and delaware caucus chairwoman irene 
natividad said at the organizations annual convention 
we are the prochoice foot soldiers in the electoral trenches 
of this country natividad told 1200 delegates and guests 
they say we have not yet proven that women vote as a bloc well 
let me tell you that is going to change 
actress cybill shepherd and former republican national committee 
chairwoman mary louise smith also addressed the organization of 
female politicians 
outside about 30 antiabortion activists picketed for about two 
hours 
we believe the majority of women around the country are not 
prochoice said protester georgeann mcgarry of new brighton 
they are prolife and we are here to represent them 
the campaign is a response to a recent us supreme court 
decision allowing states to restrict abortions 
natividad said target states have legislatures that could swing 
in favor of abortion rights depending on the outcome of a small 
number of races 
this is a pragmatic political plan that we know as pragmatic 
politicians will be effective natividad said the times are 
tough for the women in this country but we are tougher we are not 
going to get mad we are going to get even 
the prochoice issue is the winning issue because women arent 
willing to go backward said us rep nita lowey dny we 
arent willing to go back to those backalley abortions and to 
those coat hangers 
political consultant harrison hickman told the convention that 
abortionrights candidates must appeal to what he said was the 
majority of americans who support a womens choice to have an 
abortion although they might disagree with it 
natividad said local abortionrights groups will recruit and 
train legislative candidates she had no estimate for the 
campaigns cost 
miss shepherd spokeswoman for a political action committee 
called voters for choice said reproductive decisions should rest 
with the individual 
it will be a test of our commitment and political will as to 
whether the same rights will be available to an unemployed women in 
a new orleans housing project the 16yearold daughter of a coal 
miner in the hills of kentucky or a native american woman living in 
the far reaches of utah she said their plight must be our 
fight 
former rnc chairwoman smith told the group the caucus must 
convey the message that supporting reproductive rights is a good 
thing to do 
mainstream republican voices have not been heard from loudly 
on this issue she said maybe we should turn up the volume 
at a news conference former democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro said she expected the abortion issue to 
affect every political race in the country 
the choice has to be left to women and it has to be a safe 
procedure she said i think that what this issue will do is 
mobilize people who care about human rights and civil rights 
the fourday convention is scheduled to end sunday the caucus 
has about 77000 members of all political affiliations natividad 
said

even though workers were several hours behind schedule in 
completing routine work on the spaceships engine compartment 
officials said later that the launch team was optimistic that 
all lagging work would be caught up by sunday and that liftoff 
would occur as planned between 730 am and 1130 am tuesday 
the pentagon will not let nasa disclose the status of the 
countdown or the exact launch time citing national security 
reasons 
because the mission is classified countdown displays normally 
available to the news media remained blank and only members of the 
launch team and key nasa and pentagon officials were supposed to 
know where the clock stood 
the countdown will be made public just nine minutes before the 
planned liftoff 
the five astronauts flew here saturday from their training base 
in houston to make final preparations for launch 
asked by a reporter if he had confidence in riding in columbia 
after it had been grounded for so long commander brewster shaw an 
air force colonel replied absolutely you bet i do i wouldnt 
fly it if i didnt i flew columbia a long time ago its a 
great machine 
shaw piloted columbia on a november 1983 trip 
with him on the upcoming flight will be navy cmdr richard 
richards navy cmdr david leestma army lt col james adamson and 
air force maj mark brown 
the defense department will not disclose the nature of their 
mission but sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
during four or five days in orbit they will deploy a large 
reconnaissance satellite and a smaller research payload and conduct 
experiments designed to define what role military astronauts can 
play in space 
once columbia is in orbit about nine minutes after liftoff the 
pentagon will impose a blackout on all information about the 
flight except for three brief announcements about the health of 
the spacecraft and the landing time 
the silence will be broken only if there is a major problem 
defense officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult 
for soviet satellites and spy ships stationed off cape canaveral to 
monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the 
soviets with their intelligence capabilities undoubtedly already 
know a great deal about the mission and that once columbias 
satellite is in orbit the soviets will be able to track it 
precisely and know what it is doing 
this will be the 30th space shuttle flight and the fourth 
dedicated to a defense department mission 
columbia last was launched in january 1986 returning to earth 
just 10 days before the challenger explosion killed seven 
astronauts after the accident the national aeronautics and space 
administration concentrated on modifying the newer orbiters 
discovery and atlantis before getting columbia ready 
discovery and atlantis each flew twice since flights resumed 
last september after a 32month hiatus

lightning has set the west ablaze this 
summer and electricity is again surging through the nations 
wildfire command post 
the whole place is running at the max full out reed jarvis 
of the boise interagency fire center said last week 
but this year is different because the centers strategists and 
quartermasters who direct the nations wildfire battles can see 
some of the worst blazes from their windows 
as nearly half the acreage afire burns within 150 miles 
specialists in the logistics center marshal resources from around 
the nation on saturday there were about 220000 acres ablaze in 
four states with 102000 of them in idaho and the rest in oregon 
california and utah 
tell me when the airplanes got to leave and ill have the 
team on it coordinator lynn findley says into the phone cradled 
on his shoulder 
he hangs up makes another call and arranges for a procurement 
expert to fly from atlanta to lagrande ore 
another staff member fields a caller searching for a fire 
officer called joe blow 
can you believe it she says over her shoulder he spells 
his name blough 
others juggle as many as three of the constantly ringing phones 
scanning computer terminals for personnel airplanes red chemical 
retardant and gear 
we drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique 
airplanes declares the slogan on one tshirt 
in one leg of the lshaped logistics room the intelligence 
division keeps track of fires around the country the other finds 
the crews and equipment to attack the flames a big chalkboard 
plots the fires as they eat up mile after mile of fuel magnets 
resembling aircraft dot a map of the country giving the location 
and type of equipment available 
obviously firefighting on the line is stressful said fire 
center spokesman arnold hartigan but the support people are 
dealing with human life facing fire which is inherently 
dangerous 
hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the idaho backcountry for 
days after the last lightning bust one storm laid down 2000 
strikes an hour with little rain then winds reaching 80 mph and 
temperatures pushing triple digits whipped those spots into major 
conflagrations 
threeinchthick burning branches blew up to two miles ahead of 
the main fires flames swept over thousands of acres in several 
hours time creating a smoky miasma around idahos capital city 
the buzz at the wildfire nerve center intensified dramatically 
fortunately we dont work at this level all year hartigan 
said it would be unbearable if we had to do this 365 days a 
year 
the complex has taken on a military look national guard troops 
in camouflage fatigues march toward trucks for transportation to 
the fire lines smoke jumpers sit in the shade of a building 
waiting for their next leap into 100foottall ponderosa pines 
laden with chainsaws or water pumps 
we are definitely an assault organization hartigan said 
its patterned after military operations because they work were 
the supply lines for the troops 
in the logistics center specialists spin lazy susans with pink 
and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is 
answered 
the requests are for airplanes helicopters axes and shovels 
portable marine pumps hoses fresh fruit disposable sleeping 
bags soft drinks and most important manpower 
world war ii navy bombers pb4y2s and neptunes are lined up 
on the flight deck spattered with red retardant they fill up 
again and again with thousands of gallons of slurry a 
fertilizerbased substance that stops fires cold then the craft 
roar aloft toward the smoky mountains to the north 
after five dry summers backcountry timber has a moisture 
content only slightly higher than kilndried lumber and 
strategists have settled in for a long campaign 
it will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the 
nations fires until then the lights will be on at the fire 
center and the pace will be frenetic 
its like wall street its like an operating room jarvis 
says everybody knows its stressful but theyre not snapping at 
each other the key is cooperation

opposition candidates won two of three 
seats contested for parliament in multiparty elections saturday 
state television reported 
in the third byelection race the required number of voters did 
not participate and another election will be held 
although only three of 387 parliamentary seats were contested 
the poor showing by the communist party was considered an 
indication of voter sentiment before national multiparty elections 
planned for june 
low voter turnouts and the failure of a candidate to win a 
majority in byelections on july 5 led to saturdays round by law 
a turnout of more than 50 percent is mandatory and the winner must 
receive a majority of the votes cast 
less than 50 percent of the eligible voters turned out for the 
election at kiskunfelegyhaza and another round will have to be 
scheduled state television reported 
the two winners were ernoe raffay in szeged and jozsef debreceni 
in kecskemet they were backed by the hungarian democratic forum 
an alliance of political groups opposed to the ruling communists 
raffay a historian defeated karoly miklos a bus company 
manager who was the candidate of the communists reform wing and 
levente dobozy an independent raffay received 618 percent of the 
votes miklos 225 percent and dobozy 16 percent 
debreceni ran unopposed after the communist candidate and 
another rival dropped out following poor showings in the july 5 
balloting 
the evening newscast said debreceni won 70 percent of the vote 
but did not account for the remaining 30 percent 
the report said 57 percent of the electorate cast ballots in 
kecskemet but did not give the turnout in the two other races 
leaders of the communist party made campaign appearances last 
week to help the partys candidates with little success 
at a rally in kecskemet wednesday party chairman rezsoe nyers 
said that although the elections would not determine the countrys 
political future they could not be ignored because they marked the 
beginning of a multiparty election system 
lutheran clergyman gabor roszik won 692 percent of the votes in 
the july 5 byelection in goedoelloe he is considered to be the 
first opposition figure to be elected to the national assembly 
since 1947 when the last completely free elections were held 
some noncommunists won seats in 1985 under limited 
multiplecandidate elections but all candidates had to have the 
endorsement of the communistrun patriotic peoples front that 
stipulation has been removed

this farm town which claims it invented 
the hamburger fried up a 5520pound patty saturday and served it 
to about 10000 people in a bid for a spot in the guinness book of 
world records 
it was nice and juicy said doris witbrow of suamico 
the event at the outagamie county fairgrounds was a tribute to 
charles hamburger charlie nagreen who according to local 
historians mashed a meatball to make the worlds first hamburger 
in 1885 
about 50 cooks in aprons worked around a specially designed 
grill 21 feet in diameter and heated by 12 gas burners it took 
about two hours to cook the 6inchthick layer of ground chuck 
to avoid having to flip the patty grill designers steve mielke 
and joe sauer used a cover to cook both sides at once a 
truckmounted crane lifted the cover into place and suspended sauer 
over the patty as he sprinkled salt 
the burger was intended to serve 15000 people but the meat ran 
out after an hour and 45 minutes and 10000 diners five thousand 
buns were left over 
seymour plans to submit its claim to the biggest burger to 
publishers of the guinness book 
according to the guinness book the largest hamburger on record 
weighed 5005 pounds 138 ounces and was cooked in cape town 
south africa 
seymour a town of 2600 people 15 miles west of green bay 
disputes claims by other communities including hamburg ny to 
making the first burger 
according to local lore the 15yearold nagreen was selling 
meatballs from a booth at a fair when it occurred to him that 
people could carry them more easily if the meat were flattened 
between two slices of bread 
the appleton storekeeper died in 1951 after 65 years of hawking 
hamburgers at county fairs 
the grill used to cook saturdays giant hamburger was bigger 
than the patty leaving space for a bigger attempt next year said 
carl kuehne whose green bay dressed beef donated the meat

the race to be japans prime minister started in 
earnest saturday with frontrunning toshiki kaifu joined by the 
two other candidates on television saying he was young 
energetic and determined to revive his scandalplagued party 
on tuesday the governing liberal democratic party will elect a 
new leader to become japans third prime minister this year when 
the nominations deadline passed on saturday there were three 
candidates none of them wellknown or possessing a personal power 
base 
kaifu 58 is a former education minister whom analysts see as 
strongly leading because he is backed by large factions in the 
party 
the other two candidates are yoshiro hayashi 62 a former 
welfare minister who called for more open politics and shintaro 
ishihara 56 a former transport minister who comes from the 
partys nationalist wing 
one of them will replace prime minister sousuke uno who is 
resigning to take responsibility for the partys crushing defeat 
july 23 in elections for the upper house of parliament uno took 
office june 2 succeeding noboru takeshita who resigned in the 
recruit bribery scandal that has tainted most of the leaders of the 
party 
i am young energetic and have power to act kaifu said in 
an 80minute televised news conference at which the three 
candidates answered questions prepared in advance 
they all said they favor party political reforms continuing 
japans ban on rice imports and reviewing the new 3 percent sales 
tax that was a major factor in the partys steep decline in 
popularity 
they did not attack each other openly instead often saying they 
shared the previous speakers opinion 
hayashi came close to attacking the frontrunner by saying the 
partys decisionmaking should become more easy to understand 
to win back the voters trust hayashis candidacy emerged after it 
seemed there might be only one in the race kaifu the nominee put 
forward by a combination of big factions 
the partys 405 members of parliament and 47 local 
representatives vote in a secret ballot on tuesday to elect a new 
president 
the party leader will be confirmed as prime minister wednesday 
on the strength of the liberal democrats majority in the lower 
house of parliament which chooses the head of government 
but since the party lost its upperhouse majority in the recent 
election the liberal democrats may face the embarrassment for the 
first time of a socialistled majority in the upper house refusing 
to endorse the winner from the lower house 
while hayashi said he was clear of any link to the recruit co 
conglomerate that is accused of trying to bribe politicians and 
others kaifu has confirmed he received about 110000 in legal 
donations from recruit over five years 
ishihara said recruit had purchased 21700 worth of tickets to 
symposiums he organized the money was returned to recruit after 
the scandal emerged he said 
asked at the news conference about trade tension with the united 
states ishihara said japan should reject unreasonable us demands 
and blaming a lack of competitiveness in us products for the 
trade imbalance 
ishihara also attacked the government for agreeing to us 
demands to revise the agreement on joint production of a new 
fighter plane for the japanese air force japan could have built 
the fighter itself ishihara said why should we accept such a 
deal

hiroshima halted for a moment of silence 
early sunday to mark the 44th anniversary of the first atom bomb 
attack and to appeal for peace 
as a single bell wailed and more than 1000 doves were released 
into the skies 50000 people gathered in hiroshimas peace 
memorial park to mark the moment a us b29 bomber carried out the 
worlds first atomic attack 
at 815 am the precise moment when the bomb exploded in a 
flash of blinding light on august 6 1945 hiroshima citizens 
japanese government officials and visitors from throughout the 
world bowed their heads in silent prayer while buses and streetcars 
stood still throughout the city of 1 million 
the heat blast and radiation reduced to rubble and ashes a 
large portion of the western city a major military center during 
world war ii about 140000 people perished in the firestorm that 
engulfed the city 
our country as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic 
attack is determined that the tragedies of hiroshima and nagasaki 
should never be repeated prime minister sousuke uno told the 
crowd many of whom were dressed in black under a sweltering sun 
we strongly feel the duty to use hiroshima to sound an alarm 
bell for the future of all humanity from now on japan must carry 
out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and security in the 
world said uno who has announced he will resign the premiership 
a group of visiting mayors including anne rudin of sacramento 
calif presented a large wreath of yellow chrysanthemums the 
traditonal mourning flower to the victims of the bombing at their 
official monument a granite cenotaph in the center of the park

not depend on military might but on economic strength rudin said 
after the ceremony a nations greatness is not measured by the 
evil it threatens but by the good it does 
outside the ceremony hundreds of boy scouts handed visitors 
fresh flowers while protesters handed out leaflets criticizing 
alleged government laxity in preventing us warships from bringing 
nuclear weapons into the country contrary to government policy 
korean residents of japan distributed pamphlets demanding the 
government apologize for its aggression against fellow asians in 
world war ii and other conflicts 
at the memorial service 4244 names of those exposed to the 
bomb who died in the last year were added to the names enshrined on 
a tablet in the cenotaph 
although it is difficult to determine which deaths are directly 
related to the bomb researchers believe the risk of death from 
leukemia and lung breast and bone cancer is greater for those 
exposed to the bomb than for those who were not 
three days after hiroshima the united states dropped a second 
atom bomb on the coastal city of nagasaki killing another 70000

government officials even though he had promised otherwise 
according to the new york times 
the times said in sunday editions that while pierce may not have 
broken the law or directed anyone on his staff at hud to act 
improperly he regularly did personal favors for former colleagues 
at the firm 
the newspaper quoted several lawyers at pierces former firm 
battle fowler of new york as saying pierce acted ethically 
considering he was a former partner and close friend

ties with your law firm is that correct

at other government agencies 
documents show that pierce ordered subordinates to investigate 
problems that battle fowler was having obtaining hud financing 
the newspaper said 
there was no evidence that applications were approved as a 
result the times said 
the help pierce gave his old law firm began within weeks of his 
confirmation as secretary in january 1981 and continued through 
much of his tenure the newspaper said 
pierce also received monthly pension payments from the firm 
between january 1981 and january 1988 that totaled 234485 the

a balloon deflated and plunged about 
2000 feet to the ground saturday night at the national hot air 
balloon championships killing its lone occupant as thousands of 
spectators watched 
robert mock 52 of paonia colo died at our lady of the lake 
medical center about an hour after the 555 pm accident said a 
nursing supervisor who refused to give her name 
the cause of the accident was not known but witnesses said 
mocks balloon suddenly deflated burst into flames and plunged to 
the ground 
jim birk of defiance ohio director of the championships 
denied eyewitness reports that mocks balloon the chariot of 
fire too caught fire after deflating he said people on the 
ground might have mistaken flames from the balloons burner for 
accidentrelated flames 
it is apparent that the burner was operated by the pilot until 
he was about 75 feet above the ground birk said 
mock apparently turned the burner off at that point to prevent a 
fire on impact he said 
mock told his ground crew by radio that the flaps on his balloon 
were loose and he apparently tried to compensate by pumping more 
hot air into the balloon said east baton rouge parish sheriffs 
capt robert shorter 
at that point the balloon collapsed and he plunged 
approximately 2000 feet shorter said 
about 45 balloons were in the air at the time birk said 
the federal aviation administration and national transportation 
safety board were investigating the accident 
the faa tightly regulates the sport and inspects balloons 
annually or after each 100 hours of operation just as the federal 
agency checks conventional aircraft birk said 
parachutes arent required and a fire extinguisher is the only 
safety equipment carried in gondolas 
at many times there is little the pilot can do to retard a 
fall he said 
documents showed mocks last inflight certification was april 
2 1988 and his balloon was last inspected on dec 1 1988 birk 
said mocks balloon had been deemed airworthy 
up to 10000 people may have seen the accident at the greater 
baton rouge state fairgrounds shorter said 
saturday was the second day of the gathering of hotair 
balloonists the championships end aug 13 it was the first fatal 
accident in the national championships 19year history birk said

a threejudge federal panel has refused 
to stop the establishment of a single governing board for 
louisianas 17 colleges the key part of a courtordered 
desegregation plan 
it is high time that higher education in louisiana be reworked 
at all levels in a unified effort to improve the education offered 
in this state to all louisiana citizens the court said friday in 
an opinion issued in new orleans 
the panel last month ordered louisiana to replace four governing 
boards with one in a package of sweeping reforms to desegragate the 
states 17 public colleges and universities 
the judges ruled the present system has perpetuated illegal 
segregation 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed 15 years ago by the us 
justice department 
currently one board governs the lousiana state university 
system another governs the mostly black southern university system 
and a third governs the others all three boards answer to the 
state board of regents for higher education 
state attorney general william guste who had asked to court to 
overturn its decision mandating the single board said he would 
appeal to the us supreme court 
in a motion filed in new orleans on thursday guste said the 
state constitution calls for four governing boards and the federal 
court cant change the state constitution unless it is patently 
unconstitutional 
the new board has been ordered to restructure the higher 
education system beginning aug 18 
gov buddy roemer has appointed the boards 17 members and 
senate confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin aug 14 
the court on friday also rejected a request by the southern 
university board of supervisors the justice department and the 
grambling state university alumni association to put in the ruling 
specific amounts the state must spend to improve programs at 
predominantly black southern and grambling

among the dead were seven party of islam field commanders 
other rebel sources said the proislam party and party of islam 
were engaged in a power struggle that hindered efforts to overthrow 
afghanistans sovietbacked marxist government 
the bush administration responding to the july 9 killings said 
it deplored the action but its support to the afghan rebels would 
continue 
qaribur rehman saeed a spokesman for hekmatyars guerrillas 
said at the time that some party of islam guerrillas had been 
killed in the battle but denied the reports of killings afterward 
hekmatyar said saturday that 11 party of islam guerrillas were 
killed while 30 were seized and are being held captive and are 
still alive he did not give conditions for their release 
hekmatyar said his fighters ambushed the party of islam 
guerrillas because they had repeatedly attacked his local 
headquarters in northern takhar province 
he called the battle a local regional conflict and not a 
war between the two parties 
party of islam leader burhanuddin rabbani has said hekmatyars 
faction should be suspended from an interim government 
proclaimed by seven rebel factions based in pakistan 
hekmatyars group has received a major portion of millions of 
dollars worth of military aid supplied by the united states and 
channeled through pakistan 
hekmatyar who holds the title of foreign minister in the 
6monthold interim government indicated he would boycott the 
alliance if elections arent held by aug 10 
he said elections throughout warravaged afghanistan and in 
refugee camps in pakistan were essential to stop internal fighting 
among the rebel factions 
it elections would kill the tendency toward armed clashes 
he said this is the only way of putting an end to our problems 
guerrilla leaders formed the interim government during a series 
of meetings in february in the pakistani capital of islamabad 
hekmatyar joined with the condition that it hold elections 
within six months 
elections would include other parties provide a legitimate 
body to draw up a constitution dispense with tribal prejudices and 
prevent internal fighting hekmatyar said through an interpreter 
he called on afghan army units to stage a coup with the rebels 
help and set up a revolutionary council to oversee nationwide 
elections 
it appeared that hekmatyar made the proposals to try to counter 
growing criticism he and his party have been accused by other 
rebel groups of seeking to dominate the alliance 
marxist army officers seized power in afghanistan in a 1978 
coup the soviets ended more than nine years of military 
intervention to help the government when it completed the 
withdrawal of troops on feb 15 
the kremlin continues to back the government with military and 
economic aid

journalists from the soviet union and 
the united states ended a conference by stressing the need for more 
citizen diplomacy between the superpowers 
twenty bridges are better than one nickolai reimers editor 
of science and life journal in moscow said on the last day of the 
fiveday conference friday 
if we paired people up by interests paired up the exchanges 
it would be a new step reimers said through a translator 
the conference at connecticut college sponsored by the new 
england society of newspaper editors and the union of soviet 
journalists brought together nine soviet journalists and nine from 
the united states 
we need more depth of exchange said viachislav pohvalski 
editor of zaporozhskaya pravda in moscow it is part of a 
citizens diplomacy which is more important than the official 
diplomacy 
reimers said he would like to see the two organizations set up 
permanent teams of journalists to work together on stories and 
projects all over the world 
steve riley editor of the central maine morning sentinel in 
waterville said he corresponds with a soviet newspaper editor and 
the two papers exchange news stories and columns but have not been 
able to arrange a visit he agreed it would be a major step forward 
if individual exchanges could take place 
sergey runov a member of the board of the union of soviet 
journalists said the two groups could hold joint seminars and 
lectures and swap journalists such an exchange he said would 
allow people could learn the truth about each nation not just the 
propaganda 
even without exchanges the groups have made progress in thawing 
sovietamerican relations said bernard caughey an editor at the 
patriot ledger in quincy mass 
we have a saying in the united states caughey said it is 
better to light one little candle than to curse the darkness weve 
been at this a long while id like to think we lit a few of those 
candles and you in return lit candles it has been worth the 
effort 
journalists from both nations discovered they had similar 
problems in trying to obtain information for stories 
one soviet journalist said not everyone welcomes perestroika 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs reform program and said the 
soviet media has been criticized for playing a large part in 
opening the government up to examination and question 
maura casey an editorial writer with the day in new london 
said the most valuable aspect of the conference was meeting soviet 
counterparts 
all the stereotypes i grew up with are meaningless when you 
look into a persons eyes she said

negotiators for the united states and 
the soviet union have endorsed agreements permitting visafree 
travel for natives of northwest alaska and the soviet unions 
chukotsk peninsula 
the agreement reached friday in washington will become official 
when it is signed by secretary of state james baker and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze possibly as early as 
september said an aide to sen frank murkowski ralaska 
the agreement also establishes a commission of three soviets and 
three alaskans to help deal with minor incidents emergency 
evacuations and search and rescue operations said murkowski aide 
jessica gavora 
murkowski said the agreement is the most significant development 
yet in a 2yearold thaw between alaska and the soviet far east 
territories across the bering strait 
in alaska natives who live on st lawrence island the seward 
peninsula or in the kotzebue area and have cultural or family ties 
with the soviet far east are expected to qualify for visafree 
travel gavora said trips could last up to 90 days 
the federal government would determine who could go and would 
compile lists to be placed at border checkpoints 
travel would be confined to border regions 
alaska natives used to travel across the bering strait by 
motorboat to exchange walrus skins and sable fur they returned 
with flour sugar tobacco and underwear from soviet trading posts 
the agreement permitting the trips was terminated in 1948 as the 
cold war chilled relations between the united states and the soviet 
union 
with the easing of border tensions in the past two years soviet 
and alaska yupiks have renewed contacts last month bering air of 
nome began a charter service to transport groups back and forth 
across the bering strait

to hide 60 percent of the bailouts cost from the federal deficit 
but with the losses of governmentinsured deposits mounting at a 
rate of 20 million to 30 million daily house and senate leaders

open with a shot of the sun setting on a 
steamy mississippi river town cut to a smokefilled room 
a ceiling fan turns slowly as corrupt cops officials on the 
take and greedy politicians discuss shakedowns kickbacks and 
underthetable deals as a bgrade movie it might play but 
louisiana officials say it isnt reality 
they believe theyve cleaned up whatever image problems the 
states film industry had as a result of last years indictments of 
two new orleans police officers an employment office worker and 
the former director of the state film commission 
filmmaking is big business and its a growing business in 
louisiana but there was no doubt that the state had an image 
problem for a while said tisa laviolette director of the 
louisiana film and video commission 
those indicted were accused of funneling jobs to a favored few 
when movies tv shows or commercials were made in louisiana when 
the stories hit the trade publications in hollywood they did not 
go unnoticed said ron neter unit manager for one major movie shot 
in new orleans 
sure people talked about it he said it was the only 
incident of that kind i ever heard of the situation was dealt 
with though i think the fact that the state brought the people to 
trial showed that they wont allow that sort of thing 
the indictments came after shooting the hit dennis quaid movie 
the big easy which was ironically about police corruption in 
new orleans there were two acquittals and one conviction in 1988 
and numerous cases were put on hold with no trial dates likely to 
be set 
since then moviemaking moved ahead full steam in the state 
in the last year albert finney and a horde of machinegun 
carrying gangsters took over new orleans streets in the 
prohibitionera millers crossing paul newman portrayed former 
louisiana gov earl long and cavorted with a stripper in the movie 
blaze and the blob oozed its way through the little town 
of abbeville for a remake 
dale pollock the producer of blaze admitted to being a bit 
leery of louisianas reputation before coming to the state 
we had heard that some of the film commissioners had been 
indicted and the teamsters in louisiana have always had a tough 
reputation he said 
i had some doubts about what we would be asked for or if 
people were going to want something slipped to them under the 
table we havent come across anything like that however the new 
film commission is working to make sure no one gets that impression 
of the state from now on 
millers crossing the blob and blaze poured 128 
million into the depressed louisiana economy in 1988 laviolette 
said 
out of that amount id say there was 40 million in cold hard 
cash left behind in louisiana a very conservative estimate is that 
it has an economic impact of 120 million by the time it turns over 
in the community and i think we could double that figure 
the slogan of the commission is shoot the other la and 
people are listening she said in the last few years filmmaking 
in louisiana has really gone up we normally averaged seven films a 
year shot here in 1988 we did 14 and 1989 looks equally 
promising 
even though 42 states have film offices and actively compete for 
business california remains the film leader of the united states 
with new york close at its heels 
though not always cheaper its easier to make a movie outside 
california onestop statecontrolled film offices are preferred 
to californias patchwork approach where local governments issue 
permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70 
years old 
and the longheld belief that hollywood could recreate anything 
from the tara plantation in gone with the wind to the las vegas 
strip in one from the heart has been abandoned by filmmakers 
who want greater realism 
louisiana lures film companies with locations that include the 
french quarter swamps plantation homes and smalltowns 
we have the architectural styles we needed within a very tight 
radius said neter unit manager on millers crossing 
joel and ethan coen who directed and produced millers 
crossing considered san francisco portland and north carolina 
as settings before choosing new orleans 
the film is set in 1929 neter said its not specified as 
taking place in new orleans its an unidentified city we wanted 
that look though the architecture and ambiance of the time and 
we found it here weve shot all over town id say 30 locations 
and its been great 
another consideration for choosing louisiana was to have a 
location where they could shoot in the winter and not have snow 
its worked out absolutely great neter said for a film 
crew that has to be away from home for three to six months new 
orleans certainly offers a lot in cultural and epicurean 
opportunities that make your off hours more enjoyable 
we like to think of it as onestop shopping for filmmakers 
said kimberly carbo who acts as liaison between the city agencies 
and filmmakers we try to meet the needs of the people filming 
and minimize the problems it will cause local residents 
laviolette said louisiana is beginning to get repeat 
performances filmmakers returning to make other movies 
i think it is because of the positive experience they have 
working in louisiana as well as the other things we offer she 
said 
despite budget problems plaguing the governor and the 
legislature laviolette plans to ask for a 49000 increase to 
build an aggressive advertising campaign 
there are a lot of commercials movies and television 
productions shot outside of new york and california i want more of 
them shot in louisiana she said people here are not only 
enamored with the movies theyre beginning to realize what big 
business it is

the summer pastime of economists and others who 
try to anticipate the future is whether the economy is headed for a 
soft landing a recession or neither 
opinions are as varied as the grains of sand on the beach or the 
shape of the clouds or the bubbles in a drink and for the 
practical purposes of most ordinary people it matters not a whit 
who is right 
recessions come and go no freemarket economy has ever been 
without them for long they are an economic pulse preceding and 
following expansions they are in the nature of freemarket 
economies like colds are to humans 
they might come from unexpected events such as catastrophes or 
shortages or from economic mismanagement such as misinformed 
moneysupply policies or simply because when times are good people 
push things to the extreme 
whether a recession technically occurs isnt of vast importance 
to most people more significant by far is the extent of the 
downturn in terms of jobs and job security wages profits and 
prices 
technically a recession occurs when gross national product 
declines for two successive quarters but it is possible for this 
to occur without being noticed by the ordinary working person or 
in fact by entire geographic areas 
consider it is a slowdown not a recession if economic 
expansion slows but grows by a fraction of 1 percent for two 
successive quarters but it is a recession if the economy shrinks 
by a fraction for two quarters in a row 
other criteria are considered too but past recessions usually 
have been identified by the twoquarter theory 
especially important to the ordinary person is the length of a 
recession or a slowdown some are vshaped the decline is quickly 
followed by an upturn some are ushaped and some are long and 
level as a summer horizon 
is a quick corrective recession any worse than a prolonged 
downturn that doesnt qualify as a recession stagnant economies 
that stumble along the plus side of the recessionexpansion line 
might be more destructive 
theres a geographical aspect to recessions too technically 
the nations economy can be described as in recession with some 
regions enjoying good times or the numbers can show it to be 
healthy when many areas are desperately ill 
the latter in fact occurred earlier this decade when states 
dependent on oil mining and agriculture simultaneously suffered 
economic woes for different reasons 
at one time in that period an economic research organization 
sindlinger amp co measured 33 states in recession offsetting their 
depressing effect on the national statistics were coastal areas 
with expanding economies 
there is also some evidence that recessions today need not be 
quite what they used to be due in part perhaps to more informed 
economic management and maybe to the emergence of a global economy 
if the domestic consumer economy is weak for example it might be 
offset by exports to a strong foreign economy 
some economists like to refer to rolling readjustments 
rather than recessions the term is euphemistic to some extent but 
the rationale may be sound moreover it seems to be supported by 
some recent experiences 
whatever these economists believe it is less likely today than 
yesterday for most industries to go down together and more likely 
that a recession will roll through the economy affecting different 
industries at different times 
recessions can be allinclusive or selective they can be 
extended or brief they can be deep or marginal they can be 
accompanied by price increases or decreases they can be 
significant or relatively unimportant 
not all of the species is savage while you might not like to 
make a pet of any recession some of them are quite tame

when gh bass amp cos former corporate parent 
finally found a buyer for its shoe manufacturer in 1987 prospects 
for bass looked so bleak that the new owner got a bargain 
today the 113yearold bass is winning back a following after 
rescuing its reputation for quality and updating its traditional 
styles 
bass was on the block when the britishdutch consumer products 
giant unilever acquired chesebroughponds inc which had owned 
bass since 1978 
no eager buyers rushed forward because the american footwear 
industry was being crushed by foreign competition and bass looked 
like it lacked the market toehold to wage a successful fight 
bass had done nothing but struggle from 1983 to 1987 says 
john thorbeck the current bass president during this time bass 
was a prominent example of how a domestic manufacturer was under 
great pressure and at the same time was dealing with its own 
misdirection and mismanagement 
american shoe manufacturers in the early 1980s had to adjust to 
radically changing american tastes in shoes while coping with an 
influx of imports 
orderly marketing agreements with south korea and taiwan 
controlling us imports of nonrubber footwear meaning virtually 
all types of shoes were allowed to expire under the reagan 
administration at the time the two countries were major foreign 
suppliers of everything from tennis sneakers to dressy pumps 
imports surged by 1986 imported leather and plastic shoes had 
expanded to about 1 billion pairs from 520 million in 1981 said 
peter t mangione president of the footwear distributors and 
retailers of america 
the supply went to satisfy a burgeoning demand for athletic 
shoes the jogging craze evolved into the aerobics fad both of 
which were part of a bigger fitness movement that has influenced 
consumers shoe selections ever since 
the driving factor in the footwear market in this country is 
fashion and the athletic trend drove this market for the last 
decade says mangione 
in such an environment a company like bass known for 
conservative sturdy leather laceups and loafers wasnt where it 
was at 
nobody was crazy about traditional bass weejuns thorbeck 
says of the shoe named for its norwegian inspiration that debuted 
in 1936 these were the years when nike and reebok were becoming 
billiondollar companies the casual shoes were being swept aside 
by the nike and reebok hurricanes 
during those troubling years for bass which had been a private 
familyowned business for most of its history the firm branched 
out in directions that turned out to be the wrong ones 
it introduced bass air a line of athletic shoes that flopped 
it imported a line of womens shoes from brazil and the quality was 
so poor that every retailer returned its shipments to bass it 
neglected to advertise or place marketing emphasis on its handsewn 
leather moccasins and other shoes with costcutting in mind it 
allowed quality to slip 
most of basss us factories were shuttered leaving only one 
in wilton maine and one in puerto rico the company lost 46 
million on sales of 150 million in 1986 
the next year phillipsvan heusen corp famous for making and 
marketing womens and mens apparel particularly shirts bought 
falmouth mainebased bass for 79 million well under its book 
value of 130 million 
thorbeck formerly with shoe company timberland co says when 
he was brought in by phillipsvan heusen in november 1987 he felt 
bass needed to reassert its identity after mistakenly ignoring its 
own strengths for too long 
bass decided to win back affluent consumers those willing to 
pay around 100 for a pair of loafers it took a targeted 
advertising approach and placed 12page promotional pitches in the 
upscale magazines vogue and gq 
some early successes under the new ownership helped restore the 
companys confidence contemporary versions of some of basss old 
favorites appealed to retailers who probably were looking for shoe 
lines to satisfy nostalgiamad grownup baby boomers saddle shoes 
and buckskins were enjoying renewed popularity within some yuppie 
circles 
in one season we proved ourselves as traditional yet 
contemporary says thorbeck we were hitting on all cylinders 
by the fall of 1988 
some of basss recent updating touches have proved timely the 
company capitalized on the demand for socalled status sneakers 
this spring by bringing out a version of the canvas rubbersoled 
shoe swith brass eyelets leatherpadded trim and leather laces 
instead of selling a projected 30000 pairs in the first year bass 
now thinks it will sell 400000 pairs 
bass has concentrated on a relatively small selection of 
retailers including department stores bloomingdales marshall 
field and nordstrom 
it doesnt sell to discounters at all and controls the markdowns 
on its merchandise by offering reducedprice shoes at outlets 
these bassowned stores are carefully located in areas with 
numerous factory outlets that attract bargainhunting tourists 
bass has returned to profitability it earned 16 million in 
1988 on sales of 180 million and expects to report significantly 
better results for 1989 
a bass catalog has been brought out with clothing to complement 
the shoes 
thorbeck says hes pleased with the prominence retailers are 
giving bass in their shoe departments 
phillipsvan heusen has given bass management leeway to develop 
its own strategy 
one of the advantages of a company that was in this poor shape 
was we could sweep through changes without much hesitation says 
thorbeck we went back to what we knew best and we reinterpreted 
it for a contemporary customer

the junk bond market is preparing for the 
fallout from a requirement that savings and loans sell their 
holdings in these highyield high risk investments as part of the 
congressional thrift bailout bill 
some industry watchers say the elimination of savings and loans 
as a market for junk bonds could depress junk bond prices and make 
it more expensive for companies to float new highyield issues 
it is a significant pool of capital that has now been cut off 
from the highyield market of course thats going to restrict any 
market said greg scott executive vice president of the alliance 
for capital access a trade group for junk bond issuers 
others say the ban on thrift junk bond holding may not have a 
major impact 
while thrifts are important junk bond investors they dont 
comprise an enormous percentage of buying power said john j 
kriz an assistant vice president at moodys investors service 
kriz said other factors affecting the junk bond market at the 
time the thrifts sell their holdings may mitigate the effect of the 
sales among these factors are interest rates and how many new junk 
bond issues are floated 
other industry watchers say its premature to say what effect 
the bailout bills provision would have 
the provision was approved by a housesenate panel late last 
month it would give thrifts five years to sell their junk bond 
holdings so there probably wouldnt be a wholesale dumping of the 
bonds at once 
the us league of savings institutions the thrift industrys 
largest trade group said it did not lobby against the junk bond 
requirement because only about 175 of the nations 2900 savings 
and loans invest in the bonds 
of the 175 10 held about 70 percent of the 41 billion in junk 
bonds owned by the industry in the first quarter said james grohl 
a senior vice president for the trade group 
the alliance for capital access put the total junk bond 
investment by thrifts at about 14 billion whichever figure is 
correct the investment is still a small fraction of the 
approximately 200 billion junk bond market 
the alliances scott says the loss of thrifts as junk bond 
buyers would be especially troubling because it has been a 
fastgrowing market for the bonds thrift investments in junk bonds 
have doubled since 1985 he said 
but he added there are other juicy markets for junk bonds that 
have barely been penetrated such as the life insurance and mutual 
fund industries of the approximately 1 trillion in assets of life 
insurers less than 1 percent is invested in highyield securities 
scott said the ban on thrift junk bond holdings may have a 
psychological impact on the market forcing junk bond issuers to 
increase the yields of the bonds which already are substantially 
higher than treasury bonds but scott said he expected the impact 
would be temporary 
the savings and loan legislation provides a loophole for thrifts 
that want to keep their junk bonds under the bill they may form a 
separately capitalized affiliate and sell their junk bonds to it 
but scott said few thrifts would have the financial wherewithal to 
set up such a subsidiary 
junk bonds are so named because they are rated as noninvestment 
grade or speculative by the credit rating firms because of the 
higher risk of default they pay more interest to holders than 
investmentgrade bonds 
junk bonds are issued by companies that already are deep in debt 
or otherwise cannot obtain an investmentgrade rating they also 
are used to raise cash for corporate takeovers 
the alliance for capital access stands by the soundness of junk 
bonds as investments scott said he believes the divestment 
provision of the bailout bill was motivated in part because the 
bonds are used for hostile takeovers and because thrifts were using 
federally insured deposits to invest in them 
the debate was driven by emotion not facts scott said 
the pioneer and biggest booster of the junk bond market drexel 
burnham lambert inc also opposes the divestiture requirement 
no thrift has ever failed because of their investment in high 
yield bonds said spokesman steven s anreder we feel this 
action will only serve to restrict access to capital by small and 
mediumsize businesses

talk of a possible recession may frighten 
politicians and business planners but it doesnt seem to scare 
investors in the stock market these days 
the word came up with increasing frequency this past week when 
the commerce department reported that its index of leading economic 
indicators had declined for the fourth time in the last five months 
after more than 6 years of expansion many analysts said the 
chances looked increasingly high that business activity was headed 
into a slump 
yet stock prices held their ground at or near record highs 
after finishing off july with one of their strongest monthly gains 
ever 
historically the leading economic indicators have peaked four 
to six months before the economy has turned down observed suresh 
bhirud an analyst at oppenheimer amp co 
stock prices typically have peaked four to six months before 
the leading economic indicators turned down 
so whats happening this time around stock prices should have 
peaked about six months ago but havent making for considerable 
confusion among strategists and economists alike 
that isnt the only disparity giving forecasters fits unlike 
stock market investors bond traders lately have been behaving as 
though a recession were very close at hand 
before they suffered a setback on friday bond prices had risen 
dramatically in recent weeks pushing interest rates downward in 
apparent anticipation of slack credit demand and a business slump 
despite all that however optimists on the economic and 
financial outlook argue that it is unwise to try to argue with the 
stock market 
we suspect that when the last 21 months take their place in 
the history books it will be under the title what didnt 
happen said jay donnaruma at first albany corp in albany ny 
we did not have a recession the dollar didnt go to parity 
with the yen inflation didnt go to the moon and stocks didnt go 
to zero 
one of the most fascinating aspects of this rally is that 
people are still not euphoric or even very enthusiastic we suspect 
that when a large dip does come it will be caused by too much good 
news 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
265345 up 1821 from the week before 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 126 at 19164 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 460 at a record 45742 and the 
american stock exchange market value index up 159 at 37610 
volume on the big board averaged 18243 million shares a day 
against 17962 million the week before 
whenever the stock market has looked vulnerable to a setback 
this year a new corporate takeover story seems to have come along 
to revive it 
that has helped extend a dominant theme of the 1980s a 
shrinking supply of stock available to investors the continuing 
shrinkage of the supply of equities is playing a major role in this 
market said greg smith at prudentialbache securities 
at some point in theory at least stock prices could get high 
enough to drive away takeover bidders 
though that day may be getting nearer contends john connolly at 
dean witter reynolds inc it is not yet at hand 
clearly rising prices have now precluded a number of 
potential deals he said but the possibilities still seem 
rather abundant 
with huge pools of capital anxious to be deployed and armies 
of investment bankers with lifestyles to support the continuing 
shrinkage of equity should keep pushing stock prices higher

the word racketeer has acquired some new meaning 
in the highliving financial world and its not a name for the guy 
who strings tennis rackets at the country club 
to a halfdozen securities professionals convicted in new york 
and 46 futures traders indicted in chicago under a tough law aimed 
at fighting organized crime racketeer is like the ghost of al 
capone a stigma that could plague them for the rest of their lives 
if anyone in the lucrative business of buying and selling 
stocks bonds and commodities still had any illusion they were 
somehow exempt from prosecution under this law they likely were 
sobered by the events of this past week 
of particular significance were the new york convictions in the 
socalled princetonnewport case based on what many attorneys had 
called confused and even flimsy evidence of fraud 
this showed with dramatic certainty that juries will convict 
wall streeters under the racketeering law its an ominous sign for 
similar defendants facing trial especially michael milken the 
exjunk bond trader for drexel burnham lambert inc who faces far 
more serious charges 
the princetonnewport case concerned a nowdissolved investment 
firm called princetonnewport partners five of its members and 
another exdrexel trader were accused of creating phony tax losses 
via prearranged securities trades 
two days after the princetonnewport verdicts prosecutors in 
chicago announced longawaited indictments stemming from a lengthy 
undercover probe of alleged fraud in the worlds largest 
commodities markets 
again using the racketeering law prosecutors accused the 46 
defendants of turning the trading pits into their own private clubs 
where they reserved the best deals for themselves and tossed the 
dregs to unsuspecting clients 
both the chicago and new york prosecutions represent an 
aggressive application of the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organization act or rico as its commonly called it was enacted 
by congress nearly two decades ago to combat gangsters 
the law is considered one of the most powerful enforcement tools 
ever enacted in this country enabling prosecutors to seize a 
suspects assets before trial and providing for crippling fines and 
lengthy prison terms upon conviction 
despite criticism from many lawyers that the law is excessive 
its application has expanded over the years to prosecutions of 
criminal defendants ranging from union bosses to motorcycle gangs 
to politicians 
the rico acronym also the name of the caponelike mobster 
played by edward g robinson in the 1930 film little caesar 
was coined by one of the laws authors g robert blakey a notre 
dame law professor 
rico means crime is called by its correct name blakey once 
said if people are running a racket why shouldnt we try them 
for being a racketeer 
in other business and economic news this past week 
convoluted economic reports sent confusing signals into the 
financial markets the commerce department said its chief 
forecasting gauge fell 01 percent in june the fourth drop in five 
months and a strong signal of a slowdown but the labor department 
said unemployment dropped in july suggesting the economy is 
growing stronger 
alleged sleazy business practices hurt the reputations of the 
nations largest drug chain chargecard company and homeshopping 
network rite aid corp and its president were indicted on charges 
they tried to bribe an ohio regulator a top executive at american 
express co resigned for his role in trying to discredit a rival 
international banker through a smear campaign home shopping 
network inc was slammed with a 100 million defamation verdict for 
falsely claiming gte corp telephone mismanagement hurt its sales 
in the takeover business investor irwin jacobs knocked on avon 
products cos door with a 285 billion offer but the cosmetic 
giant rejected it and amax inc agreed to buy canadas 
falconbridge ltd in a 24 billion deal that would create one of 
the worlds largest metal producers
