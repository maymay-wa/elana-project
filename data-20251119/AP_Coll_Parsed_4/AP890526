foreign minister sousuke uno has emerged as the 
most likely candidate to succeed scandaltainted prime minister 
noboru takeshita who will resign soon news reports said saturday 
party leaders said uno emerged as the top contender after talks 
friday between takeshita and masayoshi ito chairman of the partys 
policymaking executive council according to reports in the 
masscirculation asahi yomiuri and mainichi newspapers 
takeshita was scheduled to meet with party secretarygeneral 
shintaro abe saturday afternoon to discuss the selection of uno 
the reports said 
uno 66 a 10term member of the powerful lower house has 
served as foreign minister under takeshita since 1987 he has held 
the international trade and industry portfolio and served as party 
deputy secretarygeneral 
an official at unos office said the reports about his being top 
contender were rumors and refused further comment takeshitas 
office was closed saturday 
party leaders reportedly favor uno because he is untainted by 
the recruit scandal which already has led to more than a dozen 
arrests and has experience in foreign affairs 
opposition to uno remains however as he is a leading member of 
the party faction headed by takeshitas predecessor yasuhiro 
nakasone who earlier this week was forced to testify about his 
links to the scandal before parliament 
itos refusal may 13 to take the top job created a leadership 
vacuum in a governing party desperately in need of a leader with a 
clean enough reputation to steer the party out of scandal 
the recruit co a publishing conglomerate at the center of the 
scandal is accused of trying to influence government policy by 
selling underpriced unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary 
and by doling out millions of dollars of political donations 
along with takeshitas resignation the scandal has led to the 
downfall of three cabinet ministers and the arrest of a former 
chief cabinet secretary many governing party members have called 
it the worst crisis since the party was founded 34 years ago 
in the meeting with ito on friday takeshita agreed to stay on 
as prime minister until a successor is found though on april 25 he 
vowed to leave office soon after the years budget clears 
parliament the budget package is due to become law on sunday 
the head of the governing party routinely serves as prime 
minister because of the partys large majority in both houses of 
parliament 
but due to the current crisis the liberal democrats are 
reportedly considering installing separate individuals in the two 
posts thus placating party elders who fear they may lose power if 
a young prime minister is named 
the reports said a possible combination is former prime minister 
takeo fukuda 84 who would assume the party presidency and uno as 
premier 
fukuda now in washington dc said friday said a younger man 
should be chosen for prime minister he is to return to japan 
sunday ito also cited his age and poor health as reasons for 
declining the job 
other names that have come up in the leadership race are lower 
house speaker michita sakaka 72 former deputy prime minister shin 
kanemaru 74 and masaharu gotoda 74 who heads the party 
political reform committee

hardliners moved to tighten their control of 
china on friday after moderate communist party chief zhao ziyang 
was stripped of his power and placed under house arrest 
students leading the demonstrations that have forced the power 
struggle continued to occupy beijings tiananmen square one week 
after martial law was declared in beijing but thousands could be 
seen leaving and crowds dwindled to about 15000 
despite the drop and the apparent ouster of zhao who had been 
more conciliatory toward the protesters students vowed to continue 
to press for social reforms and the resignation of hardline 
premier li peng 
the protesters previously have demonstrated the ability to rally 
huge numbers of citizens on short notice 
communist party members nationwide were studying two sets of 
documents as the central committee prepared to meet one document 
blamed zhao for the 6weekold student movement and the other 
called for a resolute suppression of the disturbances sources 
said 
zhao had expressed sympathy for the student movement was the 
first to call it patriotic and apparently worked behind the 
scenes to oppose the may 20 declaration of martial law in beijing 
but sources said conservatives accused zhao of splitting the 
party instigating disturbances revealing party secrets 
corruption and taking credit for achievements of senior leader deng 
xiaoping during the past decade 
on staterun news wednesday night li was quoted as saying that 
deng is the main reformer in china not anyone else 
although deng ushered in marketoriented economic reforms 
student protesters have been pressing for political freedoms such 
as a free press and an end to official profiteering millions have 
taken to the streets in recent weeks to call for the resignation of 
li and deng who are more resistant to social reforms than is zhao 
li was quoted friday in the staterun press as calling on 
soldiers surrounding beijing to conduct a resolute struggle 
against the plots of a small minority 
eastern european and chinese sources said zhao was stripped of 
power wednesday night during a meeting of top government officials 
and was under house arrest 
the partys central committee would have to ratify any 
leadership change it is expected to meet soon 
sources said officials who have worked under zhao on political 
and economic reforms also were facing punishment they include the 
partys propaganda chief hu qili vice premier tian jiyun and bao 
tong a zhao aide 
they said the main winner in the struggle appeared to be deng 
84 who apparently was behind lis imposition of martial law and is 
believed to still have final say on major decisions 
students by the thousands were leaving tiananmen square the 
focus of two weeks of continuous demonstrations by nightfall 
friday about 15000 students remained on the vast expanse that 
once was occupied by more than 100000 
students insist the drop in numbers does not mean their movement 
lost momentum or was cowed a few students admitted they feared 
violence now that the conservatives seem to be in control but most 
said they were tired of sleeping on concrete in unsanitary 
conditions 
student leaders said they were urging nonbeijing students to go 
home because they can do more in spreading the movement there than 
by staying on the square 
the leaders expressed confidence they could again quickly 
mobilize large groups of students and residents if the 
confrontation with authorities escalated 
the main train station was packed with students returning home 
the television news quoted a station official as estimating 20000 
were leaving friday 
but some said they would not leave 
everybody in the country is watching the square said one 
student leader if we leave we will betray their hopes 
on friday more government leaders embraced lis hardline 
stance 
chen yun the 84yearold head of the central advisory 
commission a powerful advisory group appeared on tv to support 
martial law and the commission later followed suit 
a government source said li xiannian 81 who formerly held the 
ceremonial post of president spoke at the meeting where the 
decision was made to strip zhao of power 
he criticized zhao for fomenting the student movement and 
equating it with a struggle between two army headquarters such 
a description indicated conservatives view the general secretarys 
alleged crimes as serious 
that speech and one given by chinas 81yearold president yang 
shangkun made up one of the documents being studied by top party 
members and officers said a government source 
yang said zhaos actions had a very bad effect on the 
nation the source said and indicated that party members 
intellectuals and journalists who participated in the movement 
would be punished

president bush arrived friday enroute to a summit 
with nato leaders hoping to use personal diplomacy to resolve a 
longsimmering dispute over europeanbased nuclear weapons 
in brief arrival remarks bush made no reference to reports that 
he would use the nato summit next week in brussels his first as 
president to announce a reduction in us troops in europe 
instead he declared the united states wants a stronger and 
more united europe and said he plans to be actively engaged in 
eastern europe promoting measures to encourage political and 
economic liberalization in poland 
bush plans to visit poland in july 
the dispute over shortrange nuclear weapons has defied 
resolution by the two main countries at odds west germany 
pressing for negotiations with the soviets to rid europe of such 
weapons and the united states supported by britain wanting to 
keep the weapons there and make them better 
other members of the 16nation nato alliance have lined up on 
one side or the other with a few stradding the fence 
officials on all sides have sought to dismiss suggestions that 
the issue would seriously disrupt the summit which was designed to 
celebrate 40 years of cold war unity against the soviet union 
as bush left washington the washington times reported that he 
planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a reduction 
of up to 10 percent in us troop strength in europe as many as 
34000 troops 
the washington post quoted sources in saturdays editions as 
saying the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cuts 
in troop strength aircraft and helicopters in europe if the soviet 
union agrees to cuts in tanks armored personnel carriers and 
artillery pieces 
numerous administration officials with bush and back in 
washington said any word on that would have to come from the 
president himself 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters aboard air force 
one en route to rome any ideas in this area would be one the 
president would want to discuss with the allies he would raise 
with his partners at this session before he discusses anything 
publicly i am not confirming or denying any decisions 
fitzwater did not dispute the newspapers account he said bush 
will be discussing a lot of different ideas with the allies but 
that he just cant speculate on what the conversations might 
amount to or what the president might suggest 
the white house spokesman also stressed bush would make no move 
on troop deployments in europe without having consultations with 
nato first 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee told cbs news that 10 percent is the probable amount 
of reduction that would occur if the soviet union accepted the nato 
proposal on conventional arms control which is now tabled 
in bonn west german spokesman herbert schmuelling said we 
have no official word of such a decision 
bush in comments just before leaving on his first trip to 
europe as president expressed hopes to see a europe that is 
truly free united and at peace he repeated his desire to move 
beyond any cold war policy of containment to integrate the soviet 
union into the community of nations 
we welcome the political and economic liberalization that has 
taken place so far in the soviet union and in some countries of 
eastern europe we watch hoping that more changes will follow 
as for the western military alliance he said nato has been a 
success by any measure but success breeds its own challenges 
today dramatic changes are taking place in europe east and west 
for us those changes bring new challenges and unparalleled 
opportunities 
in remarks prepared for his arrival in rome he praised 
usitaly ties of friendship and said the united states 
welcomes a stronger and more united europe 
several weeks of busy diplomacy including a highlevel meeting 
in bonn and two others in washington failed to settle the missiles 
issue a subject that secretary of state james a baker iii called 
extraordinarily important 
the issue is whether the united states and the soviet union 
should negotiate to reduce and possibly eliminate all the 
shortrange nuclear missiles nato and the warsaw pact have deployed 
on european soil or delay indefinitely while the two military 
alliances negotiate over reductions in troops tanks artillery and 
other conventional armories 
bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher insist that 
natos missiles which they want to make more powerful are vital 
to the defense of the alliance west germany and its supporters 
contend a series of moves by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to reduce nuclear and nonnuclear weapons reduce the missiles 
significance 
the dispute has symbolic as well as strategic facets it 
reflects on the one hand a a determination by the bush 
administration to stick to its position and on the other the 
emergence of west germany from postworld war ii acquiescence to 
the united states in nato affairs 
it should not be resolved at all costs baker said while 
predicting the missile issue would not dominate the summit next 
monday and tuesday in brussels 
until the dispute boiled over bush and the white house staff 
were planning on a calm presidential visit to friendly countries 
where he could step serenely through a series of picturetaking 
events he will visit west germany and britain as well as italy and 
belgium 
that schedule remains intact though the missile dispute 
probably will require some clever draftmanship to paper over the 
differences in a windup nato communique that stresses western 
solidarity 
in italy besides talking with italian government leaders bush 
will meet with pope john paul ii on saturday in rome and attend 
roman catholic mass and a memorial day ceremony in an american 
cemetery in nettuno on the seacost 39 miles south of the capital 
on sunday bush is an episcopalian 
after te twoday nato meeting in brussels the president will 
continue his discussions with west german chancellor helmut kohl in 
bonn on wednesday over dinner in a ballroom where mozarts magic 
flute opera premiered in 1793 and on a riverboat cruise on the 
rhine 
in london on thursday bush will have the comfort of winding up 
his travels meeting with his strongest supporter in the alliance 
mrs thatcher at 10 downing street and lunch with queen elizabeth 
ii at buckingham palace 
then on friday bush flies to maine for a weekend off

making the racy tabloids pay large sums for libel 
to pals of royalty and other notables is one thing but an award of 
nearly 1 million to the yorkshire rippers wife is provoking 
comment that things have gone too far 
whose justice is this the daily mirror asked on thursday 
preposterous declared the daily express 
the 600000pound 942000 award wednesday to sonia sutcliffe 
was the largest ever made by a british jury her husband peter is 
known as the yorkshire ripper for terrorizing northern england in 
197580 with the murders of 13 women 
it was levied against private eye a satirical magazine that has 
thrived on the notoriety of frequent libel cases the 
200000circulation magazine which is partly owned by 
actorcomedian peter cook has begun a fundraising campaign to 
avoid bankruptcy 
private eye said in 1981 and 1983 that mrs sutcliffe had sold 
her story to the daily mail for 392000 after carousing with the 
tabloids reporters at a hotel after she filed the libel action 
private eye published two articles implying she knew about her 
husbands crimes 
in the trial which began may 19 private eye admitted there was 
no deal with the daily mail but claimed the gist of its statements 
was true that mrs sutcliffe negotiated with newspapers and was 
prepared to capitalize on her husbands crimes 
legal experts said the growth of libel awards would make 
newspapers reluctant to defend stories in court for fear of high 
jury awards and incline them to outofcourt settlements even on 
statements that were true 
they and several national newspapers recommended changes in the 
libel laws which allow juries to set damages without guidance from 
judges in no other area of english civil law do juries have such 
great discretionary power 
plaintiffs in libel suits dont ask for a specific sum 
preferring not to limit the jury 
in england you are now going down the american route which 
would allow punitive damages said ross harper president of the 
law society of scotland in scotlands judicial system judges 
assess libel damages 
damages are there to compensate not to punish harper said 
we could suffer from all the deficiencies and defects of the 
american system which allow punitive damages to come in they are 
unfair they are inconsistent 
lord blomcooper chairman of the watchdog press council agreed 
that the assessment of damages should be left to judges 
john wakeham conservative majority leader told the house of 
commons on thursday the government was considering changes in the 
libel laws but he was not specific 
newspapers said that if mrs sutcliffe 38 died before her 
husband he would inherit the remainder of the award sutcliffe is 
in a hospital for the criminally insane 
in its editorial the daily mirror said the yorkshire ripper 
has claimed his 14th victim justice 
the daily express said the award made a mockery not only of 
the libel laws but of the system of justice itself 
mrs sutcliffe was right to fight for her reputation if she 
believed it maligned but how on earth could a jury seriously 
believe that it was damaged to the extent of 600000 pounds 
taxfree the editorial said 
as this award now sets a new record for libel damages the 
jury must have thought the wrong done to her good name was the most 
grievous ever considered by our courts in reality it probably 
thought nothing of the kind 
mrs sutcliffe has not commented on the award her lawyer kerry 
macgill said thursday sonia sutcliffe wasnt the person 
convicted she is an entirely separate entity 
the previous record for libel damages by a jury was 800000 
awarded to novelist and former politician jeffrey archer in july 
1987 after the star reported he had a sexual liaison with a 
prostitute and paid her hush money 
american actress koo stark received 480000 from the sunday 
people last year because of false allegations that she dated prince 
andrew after her marriage 
newspaper publisher robert maxwell won 77000 damages in 1986 
from private eye which said he financed overseas trips by labor 
leader neil kinnock in hopes of receiving a peerage from a future 
labor government 
pop star elton john got received 16 million from the sun 
britains largestcirculation newspaper which admitted its lurid 
allegations about his private life were false 
that action was settled out of court in december the judge 
scheduled to hear the case accused both sides of milking it for 
publicity

the sleeping deputies docile votes and fulsome 
tributes to leaders are gone in their place is vigorous emotional 
debate with the sound of a political and moral reawakening in this 
vast land 
freed from the fear that permeated decades of authoritarian 
rule citizens chose delegates to the soviet unions first 
competitively elected parliament 
they hoped for change and got it 
as soon as the new congress of peoples deputies convened on 
thursday deputy vilens tolpozhnikov of independentminded latvia 
took the floor he requested a moment of silence for the 20 people 
killed last month when security forces broke up a peaceful 
nationalist demonstration in tbilisi georgia 
his appeal set the tone for a surging debate that expressed the 
feelings of of a diverse country that has spent four years under 
mikhail s gorbachev probing its past and rediscovering politics 
ethnic identities and national morality 
each of us wants to talk out a sea of emotion deputy 
konstantin d lubenchenko said 
symbolizing the change one of the first to take the floor was 
andrei d sakharov the 1975 nobel peace prize laureate who only 2 
years ago was an internal exile confined to gorky 
gorbachev made one of his most passionate speeches in response 
to tough questions about his privileges as leader his position on 
ethnic conflicts and his plans for the future 
we are still learning democracy he said we are still 
forming a political culture we understand with our brains that 
its necessary to change but the system doesnt let us 
we have now reached the most difficult stage of perestroika 
he said referring to his restructuring program of economic and 
social change 
a leader of his energy and candor could hardly be imagined in 
the days of such lumbering silent figures as leonid i brezhnev 
who even had himself given the nations top literature prize in a 
campaign of selfglorification now openly reviled in soviet media 
on thursday young and businesslike deputies unseen in 
brezhnevs time took the microphone to argue with conviction and 
detail 
there was a sense of shame about the past an earnest desire not 
to repeat the tragic mistakes 
its difficult for us all to live said valentina petrovna 
a deputy from irkutsk in siberia lets think hard and not allow 
anybody to restructure the restructuring 
vladimir yavorivsky a writer from kiev declared this will be 
the last time the soviet people will allow a president to be 
elected without democratic opposition 
without change he said the people will turn away from us 
they will go back to silence to vodka and to their anecdotes 
five years ago those were among the few comforts for citizens 
who watched a closed secretive kremlin choose the elderly 
obviously infirm konstantin u chernenko to replace the deceased 
yuri v andropov as communist party leader 
chernenko pulled the country out of the 1984 los angeles 
olympics backed off arms control negotiations with the united 
states and turned away from the tentative reforms begun by andropov 
deputies in the new parliament said the soviet unions standing 
in the world has been restored by what one called brilliant 
successes in diplomacy 
then they contrasted that with the performance at home a rising 
budget deficit continuing shortages social tensions and speeches 
that lack the bold tone of the early gorbachev period 
a deputy from kharkov warned gorbachev not to act like the 
great napoleon who fearing neither bullets nor death led his 
people to victory but due to sycophants and his wife ended with an 
empire and not the republic he started with

an agriculture department transportation 
expert says the mississippi river has not recovered from last 
years drought and its reduced streamflow could bottleneck barges 
moving grain and soybeans into export this fall 
tq hutchinson of the departments economic research service 
said a sharp upturn in demand for jumbo covered railroad cars and 
continued lowwater conditions on the missouri and lower 
mississippi rivers will create a tight transportation situation for 
grain marketing 
however hutchinson said there will be sufficient capacity 
available to meet the current export forecasts for feed grains and 
wheat 
replacement of lock 26 at alton ill will close the 
mississippi river for about one week in octobernovember 1989 he 
said the closing combined with low water and a tight rail car 
supply could limit a postharvest upturn in export shipments but 
should not markedly disrupt grain distribution 
hutchinson said in a report that water levels for the lower 
mississippi in the first four months of this year were well below 
those of the same period in 1988 however the januaryapril levels 
averaged above those of the 1988 drought months june through 
december 
navigation on the middle and lower segments of the river will 
probably remain impaired in 1989 as in 1988 he said however 
sufficient capacity exists to carry the volume of grain implied by 
current marketing estimates 
hutchinson said that between 1944 and 1988 the flood measure at 
st louis mo averaged 195 feet in april falling to between 6 
and 9 feet in september thus he added a substantial reduction 
in water depth can be expected to occur between spring and fall 
last year the water level at st louis fell from 151 feet in 
april to 04 feet in september the gauges do not indicate the 
channels depth but measure the quantity of water available 
channel depths are affected by dredging and other activities 
in april hutchinson said the flood gauges at st louis 
averaged 135 feet nearly two feet below the previous year and six 
feet below the 194488 average for the month 
in the coming months flood gauges will likely reflect 
decreasing amounts of water as they did last year he said 
much of this will result from continuing low flows from the 
missouri river 
last year the missouri river supplied 65 to 70 percent of the 
flow at st louis he said normally the missouri would account 
for 45 percent although water releases in 1988 were below average 
the missouris increased share of the flow stemmed from reductions 
in the mississippi and its tributaries 
currently missouri river reservoirs are 50 percent to 60 
percent full hutchinson said the missouri river division of 
the us army corps of engineers plans to release slightly more 
water than last year but less than in a normal year 
also he said the corps of engineers plans a shortened 
navigation season this year because of the low levels of storage 
reservoirs the river opened one week later and will close 25 to 30 
days earlier than usual

retail food prices in 1989 have been pushed up 
sharply by cropbiting cold weather in the first quarter and may 
gain an average of 5 percent to 7 percent over the entire year 
according to an agriculture department forecast 
that would compare with a 1988 average gain of 41 percent and 
would be the sharpest 12month increase since 1981 when retail 
food prices rose 79 percent 
consumer demand will pull up food prices in 1989 the 
departments economic research service said thursday while 
growth in the general economy is slowing growth in real disposable 
personal income is still likely to be 2 percent to 3 percent this 
year after rising 29 percent last year 
the report said the labor departments consumer price index for 
food increased at an annual rate of 86 percent in the first three 
months of 1989 well above the rate expected last fall 
additional upward adjustments are likely for the rest of this 
year based primarily on the strength of consumer demand and the 
impact of higher petroleum prices the report said 
much of the sharp rise in the first quarter was blamed on cold 
weather in mexico florida and california which cut supplies of 
fresh vegetables retail prices which had been expected to decline 
during the quarter rose an average of 57 percent 
other price increases in the first quarter resulted from 
lingering effects of last summers drought 
processed vegetable prices continued to rise because of 
smaller supplies of canned sweet corn green peas snap beans and 
dry beans all victims of the drought the report said smaller 
supplies of canned vegetables forced frozen vegetable prices higher 
as well 
retail egg prices rose 295 percent compared to a year earlier 
production was cut back because of high droughtrelated feed 
costs the report said 
food price increases are expected to be more moderate in the 
remainder of 1989 prices for meats poultry and fish will remain 
reasonably stable for the rest of the year the report said egg 
prices are expected to fluctuate but should remain well above 
yearearlier levels

the state department needs to know more if 
its going to help find a sacred jewish scroll that was being 
smuggled from iran to the united states when it was allegedly 
seized by officials in the united arab emirates 
without more information theres no way that the department 
which wants to be helpful can be a state department official 
said thursday speaking on condition that his name not be used 
there just doesnt appear to be anywhere else to turn 
rep charles schumer dny has asked the state department to 
help recover the 150yearold persian torah which had been 
destined for a new persian synagogue in queens ny 
but the state department has been unable to locate the holy 
book the man who was transporting it or the official who allegedly 
confiscated the scroll in the tiny arab emirate of ras alkheimeh 
a spokesman for the embassy of the united arab emirates did not 
return several phone calls thursday 
the torahs owner an iranian woman asked a friend of her 
husband in november 1988 to smuggle the sacred scroll to dubai 
iranian law prohibits exporting a torah according to schumer 
the woman was sending the torah to her brother in brooklyn 
ny who was planning to donate it to synagogue beit knesset omid 
we were going to have a grand opening at the synagogue and i 
was expecting to put this torah at the grand opening the brother 
said in an interview from new york he spoke on condition that his 
name not be used for fear that the iranian government might 
retaliate against his family 
the brother said the scroll had been in his family for 
generations 
the value of this torah if you are jewish is priceless he 
said 
schumer put its price in the tens of thousands of dollars if it 
is indeed 150 years old 
the smuggler took the scroll by boat from a port in southern 
iran to dubai where he planned to mail it to the united states 
schumer said but in ras alkheimeh the courier was stopped by 
government officials and the scroll was confiscated schumer said 
in a letter to secretary of state james a baker schumer said 
he has learned that the person who seized the torah was javad 
hadad a member of the justicepolice department schumer provided 
a phone number for hadad but there was no answer there thursday 
the state department spokesman said the us consul in dubai had 
tried to chase down schumers leads to no avail 
that name has been given before but they have not been able to 
track him down as much as theyve tried the spokesman said 
were really at a stone wall right now 
schumer blamed the torahs alleged confiscation on arab 
antisemitism 
its a human rights issue he said i think they can be 
embarrassed because this is the most vulgar kind of antisemitism 
that could exist

throw away your crystal ball its a 
topsyturvy world events dont turn out the way you might have 
supposed predictions arent worth very much just look around 
west german chancellor helmut kohl a conservative is in the 
vanguard of west europeans seeking disarmament and an accommodation 
with the soviet union 
hes resisted the blandishments of president bush and disrupted 
the script for the nato summit meeting to be held monday and 
tuesday in brussels by demanding a negotiated reduction in 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
brave us talk of a western alliance able to withstand tensions 
cannot obscure the fact that the usually reliable west germans 
and not the independent french or a smaller leftleaning ally 
have opened a rift that challenges natos very reason for being 
if the time has come to negotiate the elimination of battlefield 
nuclear missiles in europe because the soviet threat has receded 
then natos purpose is due for a reassessment 
bush was going to europe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of 
the alliance there still will be walltowall photoops in 
brussels but behind the scenes diplomats will be up late trying 
to paper over the uswest german split with smiles and ambiguity 
all in all a strange turn of events but not the only surprise 
on the world stage 
down in panama despite hopeful us predictions and a unanimous 
indictment by the organization of american states that he was 
responsible for grave events and abuses gen manuel antonio 
noriega clings to power defying all efforts to dislodge him 
more than a year ago elliott abrams then the us assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs said noriega was 
hanging by fingertips the united states regarded ousted 
panamanian president eric arturo delvalle as the legitimate 
authority 
however delvalles government ceased to exist 15 months ago 
and noriega is in effective control of panama he evidently still 
can depend on the military for support without the assistance of 
the generals apparently there is no way for washington to force 
noriegas ouster 
he is still there defying the odds and the predictions 
in afghanistan president najibullah scorned by the reagan and 
bush administrations as moscows inept puppet is still in power 
without a single russian soldier standing behind him 
rebels armed by the united states and pakistan were supposed to 
move in for the kill right after the red army withdrew the troops 
left in midfebruary but najibullah remains in charge in kabul 
could any seer have predicted only a few months ago the turmoil 
sweeping china the open defiance of generals ordered to move 
against student protesters the democratic slogans from a people 
staggering under marxist rule 
that poland would come to terms with the catholic church that 
hungary would have a stock exchange that the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini would retain his grip on iran well into his 80s that 
mikhail s gorbachev would end weapons shipments to nicaragua 
the soviet leader of course has turned out to be the biggest 
surprise of all he is not what the united states had come to 
expect from moscow 
some 30 years ago nikita khrushchev in a flurry of reform and 
showmanship upset the wests balance since his downfall in 1964 
the united states and its allies could count on a certain amount of 
predictability 
until gorbachev came along 
he has kept the west off balance constantly ronald reagan who 
had dismissed the soviet union as an evil empire wound up 
having five summit meetings with gorbachev and signing a landmark 
treaty to eliminate an entire category of us and soviet nuclear 
missiles 
george bush apparently is still trying to figure out gorbachev 
the us response to soviet arms control initiatives has been 
cautious 
after all there is no way of predicting what might happen next

former housing secretary samuel pierce 
provoked anger and disbelief among members of a congressional panel 
that questioned him about a housing subsidy program which 
investigators say was riddled with favoritism 
pierce who is now a new york lawyer told congressional 
investigators thursday that he wasnt directly involved in deciding 
which projects received grants under the program he said a 
committee of his subordinates at the department of housing and 
urban development selected the winners and his approval was a 
rubber stamp 
pierce said he wasnt influenced by wellconnected republicans 
and former hud officials who obtained a large portion of the 
multimillion dollar subsidy projects acting as consultants or 
developers 
perhaps we should have watched the program closer than we 
did pierce said in the closest he came to acknowledging any 
blame but weve got a whole department to run 
pierces appearance before a house government operations 
subcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigative 
report sharply criticized the management of a hud program that 
provided indirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately owned 
lowincome housing projects 
current hud secretary jack kemp has suspended further awards 
under the program pending a review 
pierce who headed hud for eight years under former president 
reagan testified that he recommended congress kill the socalled 
modrehab program 
but his remarks stirred strong reaction among members of the 
subcommittee which questioned him for more than two hours 
when pierce suggested that democrats had also profited from the 
program a nearshouting match erupted with rep barney frank the 
massachusetts democrat charged that pierce was trying to deflect 
some of the blame by making irresponsible statements he could 
not back up 
at one point during their exchange pierce said i dont think 
and did not complete his sentence frank shot back well 
that has been clearer and clearer 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif told pierce the 
suggestion that the republicanappointed inspector general was 
protecting democrats was difficult to fathom 
rep bruce morrison dconn told pierce that despite eight 
years in the cabinet job his remarks suggested you dont really 
today understand how this program works 
i did not have hands on pierce responded 
hud inspector general paul adams said an audit he conducted 
found a pattern in which former department officials and other 
wellconnected republicans received an inordinately large share of 
project awards among those cited was former interior secretary 
james watt who was reported receiving a 300000 consulting fee on 
a maryland project 
pierce acknowledged that department officials used their own 
discretion in awarding subsidies but said that was because 
congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fairshare 
allocation procedures 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif read from a memo 
that he said the inspector general sent pierce in 1988 warning him 
of problems in the program 
pierce said by then he had altered the selection process he 
said he did not respond to the inspector generals suggestion 
because those changes needed time to work 
the inspector general is not god pierce said 
rep margaret roukema rnj and the subcommittees chairman 
rep tom lantos dcalif expressed surprise at pierces reaction 
to adams memo which lantos called a very very dramatic 
recommendation 
pierce responded that he did not remember the memo and added 
well there were a lot of fights going on 
pierce said he met with watt on the maryland project but 
referred him to the appropriate office at hud and told him that 
wed look very carefully at his project 
no promises were made to him pierce said

house democrats anticipating a historic 
resignation next week of speaker jim wright are making plans for 
quickly promoting majority leader thomas s foley of washington to 
the powerful speakers post 
but intrigue is brewing for filling in the rest of the party 
leadership slots as some democrats worry that rep tony coelho 
foleys likely successor could hurt the party because of questions 
about his own financial dealings 
foley talking with reporters thursday in seattle said he spoke 
to wright earlier in the day and the speaker repeated his desire 
to have an opportunity to state his case his side of the case to 
the widest possible audience and hes determined to take that 
opportunity at the first time that seems appropriate 
i assume that will be with either next week or shortly 
thereafter foley said 
leadership sources in the capitol said arrangements were being 
made for wright to make a resignation address to the house next 
wednesday but the speaker himself had not yet decided on his 
precise course of action 
wright dtexas remained secluded in his office thursday but 
he released a statement making clear he no longer was seeking any 
plea bargain with the house ethics committee 
one of the most serious charges made by the ethics committee was 
that wrights wife betty was given a nowork job by wrights 
friend and business partner george mallick house rules prohibit 
gifts from people with interest in legislation and the committee 
said it believed mallick a fort worth developer had an interest 
wright who has vowed to clear his wifes name dispatched his 
attorneys on wednesday in search of a deal that would accomplish 
that according to sources who said the lawyers offered his 
resignation in exchange for the panel dropping at least the charges 
that involve his wife 
but the deal fell through as republicans and at least one 
democrat on the panel resisted 
wright on thursday distanced himself from the effort and 
indicated it was over 
there is no deal now there will be no deal in the future 
he said in the statement insisting he had never personally engaged 
in the discussions 
it remained unclear whether wright if he resigned his 
speakership would at the same time resign his seat in the house or 
if that would happen soon thereafter the ethics committee would be 
forced to abandon its case only if wright left the house 
if wright resigns his speakership his party would quickly 
caucus to fill his post and the house presumably would elect the 
popular foley the no 2 house democrat 
if foley moved up to speaker his post of majority leader would 
become vacant 
coelho dcalif would be next in line however coelho 
recently admitted that he failed to include on his financial 
disclosure forms a 50000 bank loan that he used toward purchasing 
junk bonds 
on thursday the los angeles times reported the justice 
department is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of 
whether coelho received favors from drexel burnham lambert inc 
the firm that issued the junk bond 
after the troubles surrounding wright some lawmakers were 
privately promoting rep dick gephardt dmo for the majority 
leaders post gephardt and coelho are political allies but the 
missouri democrat did not rule out such a run 
gephardt press spokesman deborah johns said her boss is 
waiting to see what the speaker is going to do hes listening to 
people and at this time he just hasnt made a decision 
rep ed jenkins dga also was being mentioned for a 
leadership spot contenders lining up for coelhos no 3 whips 
spot should he try to move up included rep david bonior 
dmich the current chief deputy whip and democratic caucus 
chairman rep william h gray iii dpa 
the politicking was taking place quietly 
theres a certain amount of inappropriateness in mounting a 
campaign before the funeral quipped rep pat williams dmont 
some democrats were distressed at the turn of events with the 
speaker seemingly being forced out before the ethics committee even 
moved into the phase of its proceedings during which wright could 
testify and make his case 
my heart is so heavy that this could happen to the house of 
representatives said rep charles rangel dny who in 1986 
ran unsuccessfully for whip 
rangel said he was especially bothered by those members who have 
called for wrights resignation because he is embarrassing the 
house 
i was outraged because hell theres nothing wrong with 
embarrassing other members of the damned house he said heatedly 
i just cant think how youd ask someone to damage the office and 
walk away from it without fighting like hell

a nobel laureate said thursday that none 
of the scientists who spent three days discussing experiments on 
roomtemperature fusion believes the research is a key to creating 
energy 
however robert j schrieffer said chemists and physicists are 
finally talking to each other and are forming collaborations to 
work together on various cold fusion projects 
the workshop on cold fusion phenomenon attended by 440 
researchers from 14 nations concluded thursday without reaching a 
consensus other than that researchers have a lot of work to do 
physicists chemists engineers and other scientists wrangled 
over the conclusions reached in numerous experiments performed in 
the two months since university of utah researchers announced they 
had produced nuclear fusion in a jar 
the debate centers over the phenomenon of excess heat reported 
by the utah researchers and the subsequent discovery of nuclear 
fusion indicators such as neutrons reported by other scientists 
trying to verify the utah work 
no one has reported both heat and nuclear particles leading 
some to conclude that the utah experiment did not produce cold 
fusion 
schrieffer of the university of california at santa barbara 
said he believes the presence of heat without observed nuclear 
particles is a smoking gun in the utah experiments 
i personally do not believe the heat was from anything but a 
chemical process he said at a news conference after the session 
ended 
however he also said he believes experiments that found 
evidence of a low level of neutrons or gamma rays indicated energy 
was coming from a fusion source and those hold promise for 
scientific study 
fusion has long been touted as the possible energy source of the 
future it would be clean because it produces virtually none of the 
radioactive waste associated with the fission reaction of nuclear 
power plants and would be plentiful because the basic fuel would 
come from water 
but norman hackerman a national academy of sciences member who 
cochaired the conference told the final session few of us if 
any look upon this source as a viable source of power 
steven e jones a brigham young university researcher whose 
cold fusion experiments have measured low rates of neutrons also 
said he does not believe cold fusion will be a power source 
its a rose not a tree jones said its not going to 
give us energy but it is beautiful 
the cold fusion concept announced by university of utah chemist 
stanley pons and british colleague martin fleischmann on march 23 
stirred the scientific world with its very simplicity 
the researchers said they produced a fusion reaction in a simple 
apparatus they ran electrical current through electrodes of 
palladium and platinum in a jar of heavy water which is made with 
an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium 
pons and fleischmann reported the release of heat which they 
attributed to nuclear fusion they backed down from original claims 
they measured gamma rays but have claimed subsequent experiments 
yielded up to 10 times more energy than was consumed 
the two researchers did not attend this weeks conference 
papers presented by researchers at texas aampm university brigham 
young los alamos national laboratory and others reported measuring 
neutrons or gamma rays or the presence of tritium but no excess 
heat 
one group led by robert a huggins of stanford university 
reported heat but did not test for the presence of nuclear 
byproducts 
others such as california institute of technology found no 
indications of heat or nuclear processes

clifford b stearns owner of five motels and 
three restaurants in central florida george sangmeister veteran 
of the internecine battles of the illinois legislature jim walsh 
expeace corpsman son of a congressman fighter of civic 
corruption in syracuse ny 
they came to washington in january marching to their own agendas 
and now find themselves freshmen in a congress preoccupied with its 
own troubles 
selfflagellation is what one of them calls it another 
deplores the stick it to you partisanship he finds here while 
the peoples business waits 
stearns wanted to restore a citizens congress he has a 
constitutional amendment to limit people to 12 years service in 
washington then let them have a year to find out again what it 
is like to get a parking ticket 
walsh came here to make certain the farmers of upstate new york 
had some representation nobody from the empire state had been on 
the agriculture committee for a long time he wangled a place on 
it we have lots of dairy farmers he says 
sangmeister ticks off his issues education the need to adjust 
americas defense posture in view of fresh winds blowing from 
moscow and beijing the environment we used to joke about the 
idea of global warming but we dont laugh anymore he says 
they talked thursday about their initiation into a congress that 
seems obsessed with itself its pay its speaker its ethics 
two months went into maneuvering over whether to take a 51 
percent pay raise then came the rejected nomination amid charges 
of booze and womanizing of former texas sen john tower to be 
secretary of defense there was the shabbiness of the john mack 
affair the resignation of the most powerful aide on the hill 
the 436th congressman after a woman he brutally attacked years 
ago pointed a finger at him 
and now what appears to be the inexorable removal of a speaker 
of the house for violating an ethics code that didnt exist when he 
came to washington 34 years ago 
at the capitol on a glorious morning it seemed obvious why jim 
wright would be reluctant to give up his role as king of the hill 
it has been a wet lush spring the azaleas and tulips have 
faded but the magnolias white blooms as big as a soup bowls are 
just opening 
on the steps of the capitol rep norman y mineta dcalif 
marks time with his feet while the emerald regime marching band and 
color guard from morgan hill calif in gold green and black 
perform a concert for the benefit of anyone happening by 
for just this moment the bandsmen lugged their gold green and 
black uniforms and their instruments all the way from california 
youngsters in baseball caps their fellow americans here on class 
trips applaud take snapshots chew gum 
what im seeing as a new member is a lot more partisanship 
that id have thought says democrat sangmeister inside 
almost as though theres a well its our turn to stick it to 
you atmosphere 
it started with the tower matter then the wright affair now 
the democrats going after newt gingrich new house republican 
whip accused of ethics violations 
the elections over we ought to be getting on with the 
peoples business sangmeister said 
republican walsh hurrying to a meeting pauses in the speakers 
lobby it is hung with oil portraits of house speakers the famous 
and the forgotten 
speakers of the house of representatives of the united 
states says a plaque chosen by the people honored by the 
preferment of their associates 
walsh whose own father william served in congress from 
197379 says he wonders about congress selfflagellation he 
says he speaks as one who helped send a mayor of syracuse to 
prison but worries that the image congress is giving itself is 
destructive in the long run 
were good people he says of his colleagues but the 
people of the country need assurance of that 
stearns the citizen congressman the only republican to win 
an open democratic seat last fall admits he ran using jim wright 
as a symbol of what was wrong in washington 
now he says he thinks higher of the institution than he might 
have guessed 
he got on the banking committee which immediately plunged into 
the savings and loan crisis 
we were there working on that bill day after day it wasnt 
partisan everyone came together to honestly solve this problem 
the chairman rep henry gonzalez was fair ive got to admit 
that he let everyone speak when we were done it was after 
midnight we gave the chairman a standing ovation

the rhythmic art of tap dancing which 
nearly became extinct during the 1950s isnt tapped out just yet 
a joyful chorus line of dancers proved as they shimshamshimmied 
across the golden gate bridge 
there is a happiness there when i tap dance said veteran 
hoofer marilyn winston there are very few ways that comes out of 
my body its a natural happiness that comes out of me i have to 
tap to live 
although wind and salt air threatened to blow off their hats and 
sandblasters drowned out much of the performance about 30 dancers 
hoofed it across the bridge thursday to celebrate national tap 
dance day 
the national celebration coincided with the birthday of 
legendary staircase tapper bill bojangles robinson who was 
born on may 25 1878 and died in 1949 
robinson and howard sandman sims popularized the dance in 
muscial extravaganzas of the 1930s and 40s and it later gained 
respectability on the stage at carnegie hall 
in the 1950s new york choreographers made the decision not to 
put tap in broadway musicals because it got more and more 
superficial like a joke with the big funky moves said rosie 
of rosie radiator and the san francisco supertappers who helped 
resuscitate the form during the past two decades after it faded in 
the 50s 
the troupe led by rosie in her red flared skirt white tuxedo 
vest and sailor hat is in the guinness book of world records for 
longest tap dance a 73mile performance 
tap which blends african dance with the irish jig and lively 
english clog originated among black dancers performing on street 
corners and in saloons unlike ballet dancers tap dancers hold 
their body limp like a rag doll and use the natural movements to 
belt out rhythms with their feet 
its the way kids move before their mother tells them to stop 
scraping their feet said rosie describing the art of making 
music with your feet the foot is like a musical instrument and 
today we are playing the bridge 
against a backdrop of san francisco skyscrapers and a vast 
expanse of water below the tappers made their way across the 
sixland bridge from marin to the san francisco side where they 
received a city hall proclamation 
tap dancing is widely recognized as americas onlyoriginal 
form of dance yet for years it has been in danger of becoming a 
lost art said rep john conyers dmich whose resolution was 
passed by the house on thursday declaring may 25 national tap 
dance day senate approval is expected he said in a telephone 
interview from washington dc 
conyers who admitted being a frustrated tap dancer soon to 
begin lessons said former bojangles dance partner lloyd story 65 
tried to tap on the floor of the house but was barred by the 
parliamentarian who said it violated rules against demonstrations 
on the bridge debby kelehey an escalator mechanic who 
practices on broken escalators in her cowgirl costume passed the 
goldsequined torch of tap during the singlefile relay watched 
by wideeyed drivers 
i dont care if im overweight and pushing 40 i feel like a 
star she said thrusting her arms out like ethel merman

the house agriculture committee has approved 
emergency relief legislation to help farmers cope with drought 
devastation to their crops 
the bill passed thursday was originally intended to apply only 
to winter wheat crops but numerous amendments offered by 
congressman in nonwheat states expanded it to include feed grains 
cotton rice soybeans peanuts sugar beets sugar cane and 
tobacco 
rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the agriculture 
subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains and chief architect 
of the legislation said the inclusion of the other crops which 
either have been affected by dry weather or are susceptible to 
future drought was a political accommodation 
we felt if we were going to come with a disaster program we 
had only one bite of the apple he said recognizing that 
producers of crops other than wheat needed help but acknowledging 
that a multitude of legislation was not feasible 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told the committee in a 
letter to glickman that he would not recommend that president bush 
sign the bill unless it was budget neutral in that case it 
would have to apply only to 1989 crops affected by drought and be 
accompanied by a promise that congress would agree to use crop 
insurance as the sole vehicle for disaster assistance after this 
year 
i think we are in the ballpark said rep kika de la garza 
dtexas chairman of the agriculture committee after the vote 
the concern about crop insurance remains a stumbling block 
because farmers consider the current program unsatisfactory 
i hope the secretary wont hold this bill hostage in order to 
pass crop insurance said rep bill sarpalius dtexas he said 
the current system which requires farmers to pay insurance 
premiums to protect against the effects of bad weather doesnt 
work 
de la garza pointed out that house improvements to the crop 
insurance bill would not be completed in time for action on this 
bill but he said the progress congress is making should indicate 
that continued emergency relief such as this legislation will not 
be needed in the future 
john campbell deputy agriculture secretary in charge of 
commodities appeared before the committee to explain yeutters 
concerns after the vote he said the secretarys first question 
would be how much will it cost 
de la garza estimated that the bill would cost about 1 billion 
an amount close to what the government will save in price support 
payments to farmers an amendment to the bill offered by rep fred 
grandy riowa prohibits disaster relief from exceeding the amount 
saved in price supports 
since the drought caused a shortage in commodities supply 
primarily wheat prices should rise alleviating the need for 
government subsidies the money that had been set aside for the 
price supports would therefore be used to pay the farmers who lost 
their crops to drought 
the administration wants farmers to purchase crop insurance 
rather than depend on the government to bail them out when bad 
weather causes crop failures 
the bill would require farmers to have insurance after this year 
to cope with bad weather or other natural disasters

fry compared to the 9yearold girl he saved from drowning 
montagna 43 had landed the fish sunday at the deschutes river

treacherous sinkhole 
i jumped in where i thought shed be and went down too

girl was nowhere to be seen 
it was the sickest moment of my life she could have been 
inches from my fingers 
moments later the girl popped out of the water about 12 feet 
away montagna an ironworker grabbed the girl and pulled her out 
of the water with the help of others on shore 
amber wasnt breathing but her heart was still beating and she 
was revived said her mother lola blankenship 
there are no thanks big enough for this gentleman 
blankenship said very few people come out alive because of the 
rocks the river is so mean it just boils 
i was in the right place at the right time montagna said 
the deschutes runs through bend in central oregon about 160 
miles southeast of portland

navy and fbi investigators stymied so far in 
their search for accidental causes of last months explosion aboard 
the battleship iowa are conducting a very thorough criminal 
investigation involving two shipmates who had a falling out 
officials say 
the officials most of whom asked not to be identified said no 
conclusive evidence has been developed suggesting criminal intent 
either homicide or suicide was behind the april 19 blast that 
killed 47 sailors 
but there are some unusual aspects to the relationship between 
these sailors that is being investigated said one source 
we have no evidence to prove homicide or suicide here added 
deborah johnson a naval investigative service agent in norfolk 
va where the iowa is based she described theories of homicide or 
suicide as possibilities among many possibilities 
let me put it this way said peter williams the pentagons 
chief spokesman the navy is investigating all leads that it 
gets it wants to be very thorough with this investigation 
williams agreed publicly thursday that the navys inquiry had 
a criminal investigation aspect to it and that the fbi was 
doing more than just helping the navy sift through forensic 
evidence but he declined further discussion of the criminal 
inquiries 
at the same time williams announced that investigators had 
ruled out another leading accident explanation for the explosion in 
the iowas no 2 gun turret that the powder for the 16inch gun 
had been rendered unstable by improper storage last summer 
the navy is still investigating why the iowas powder was stored 
aboard hot nonairconditioned barges last summer during an 
overhaul but williams said subjecting the powder to high 
temperatures affects its shelf life not its stability 
as for the criminal inquiry the sources said investigators are 
looking into the relationship between 25yearold gunners mate 
clayton m hartwig who died in the blast and gunners mate 3rd 
class kendall truitt 21 who survived 
the two had been best friends and named each other as life 
insurance beneficiaries but had a falling out last year when 
truitt got married truitt stands to collect 100000 from the life 
insurance policy on hartwig 
truitt worked at the bottom of the sevenlevel gun turret aboard 
the iowa while hartwig worked at the very top next to the huge 
guns the only men to survive the explosion were those at the very 
bottom 
nbc news has quoted unidentified sources as saying the navy is 
investigating the possibility that a detonating device was hidden 
in a burlap patch that gunners insert between bags of powder the 
patches are designed to clean the barrels of the battleships guns 
during firing 
johnson of the nis said thursday that in a search of truitts 
home after the explosion investigators found one of the burlap 
patches yes it was there but it wasnt tampered with she 
said its a fact that people pick up items for memorabilia 
a search of hartwigs car last monday meanwhile turned up a 
crude detonating device and the book how to get even without 
going to jail new york newsday reported thursday the book 
explains how to build booby traps and other deadly devices 
according to sources the newspaper did not name 
truitt was quoted in reports last week as saying the navy 
created homicide or suicide explanations involving him and hartwig 
to make them scapegoats for an explosion investigators cannot 
otherwise explain 
alan holt the father of a fort myers fla man killed in the 
explosion said he also was skeptical of reports suggesting 
sabotage was behind the blast 
holt said he wondered if theyre going to let those two guys 
take the blame to get it off the navys neck 
his wife karla holt added you have to wonder about whether 
the suspected sailors are scapegoats the holts only son 
scott alan was among the 47 people killed 
truitt from tampa fla has said that in response to 
investigators questions he denied a homosexual relationship with 
hartwig he is on leave from the ship and is being transferred to 
another post williams said thursday 
truitt arrived at miami international airport on thursday night 
in the company of his wife and miami attorney ellis rubin truitt 
refused to talk but reporters asked rubin if his client had been 
charged 
no but theres been a lot of media accusations and youve 
got to respond to them rubin said so were going to do that

the discovery of two serious cracks is 
necessitating the replacement of part of the steel hull of a 
nuclear submarine under construction at a groton conn shipyard 
the electric boat co said 
navy officials said thursday they have opened an investigation 
into the cracks on the topeka a ssn688 fastattack sub 
the problem in the electric boat shipyard is quite severe 
and a very unusual occurrence the company said in a memo to 
lawmakers 
a thorough investigation is being conducted which will include 
recommendations for repair the memo said topeka will not put 
to sea until electric boat and the navy are fully satisfied that 
the vessel is safe 
electric boat a division of general dynamics corp said 
workers discovered the cracks on the outer steel hull monday 
afternoon during sandblasting operations in groton and reported 
them to the navy 
the hull is made at electric boats plant in north kingstown 
ri and assembled at the companys main plant in groton 
company spokesman neil ruenzel reached late thursday said the 
memo may have overstated things as far as severity 
ruenzel said a very small section of the hull has been 
removed and will be replaced 
its quite severe from the standpoint that we would not let 
that matter go unattended and we felt and do feel that it was 
necessary to remove that section not only for analysis but we 
would not deliver that submarine with cracks he said so the 
severity meant that the section needed to be replaced 
its a big job but were equipped to handle that ruenzel 
said 
he provided no cost estimate and said he did not know if the 
replacement will delay the project ruenzel said he was unaware of 
any similar cracking of a submarine hull 
perry pockros an aide to rep sam gejdenson dconn who 
represents the groton district said it was clear the cracks would 
force electric boat to push back its sept 30 commission date 
lt jim wood a navy spokesman on submarine issues said the 
navy had no immediate comment 
the topeka designated ssn754 is a 360foot 6900ton los 
angelesclass submarine the vessels designed to hunt down enemy 
subs and surface warships are armed with mark 48 antisubmarine 
torpedoes harpoon missiles and tomahawk cruise missiles 
construction of the topeka ordered by the navy in 1983 was 
begun on jan 23 1988 it is scheduled to be commissioned on sept 
30 
the los angelesclass submarines are built by electric boat and 
the newport news va shipbuilding co the last ssn688 is 
expected in the 1990 fiscal budget the subs will be replaced by 
the ssn21 seawolf 
ruenzel said armco inc of parsippany nj supplied the steel 
on the part of the hull that cracked 
it is too premature to identify any financial liabilities 
the memo said results of a complete investigation will be 
required

the american civil liberties union says it 
will defend a pair of ohio veterans if the government prosecutes 
them for arranging trips to vietnam to heal old deep wounds 
from the war they fought there two decades ago 
the announcement thursday came just one day after the treasury 
department reaffirmed its intention to pursue a vigorous 
enforcement program against violations of embargoes that it says 
prohibit americans from promoting or arranging unauthorized travel 
to vietnam 
susan r brenda legislative analyst with the washington office 
of the aclu said the treasury department is simply without 
authority to reach directly into the first amendmentprotected 
activities of americans in the united states and prevent them from 
organizing towards the perfectly legal end of travel to vietnam 
ms brenda appeared at a news conference with donald mills and 
john myers members of the vietnam veterans of america chapter in 
akron ohio the two men have organized six bargainrate tours of 
vietnam for veterans since 1984 and they said they will go ahead 
with another in november 
we believe that an attempt to prosecute vietnam veterans for 
traveling back to vietnam in an effort to learn about presentday 
vietnam and heal old deep wounds would be a grave mistake ms 
brenda said should the government proceed along that course 
however we will assist these veterans in their legal defense 
it is legal for americans to travel to vietnam but the treasury 
department issued regulations last year making it illegal to 
arrange promote or facilitate group or individual tours or 
travel to any country listed under the trading with the enemy act 
this list now includes vietnam cambodia north korea and cuba 
mills and myers began organizing tours of vietnam after mills 
revisited the country in 1984 as a member of the national board of 
vietnam veterans of america which was looking into controversies 
over the defoliant agent orange and the issue of american 
servicemen missing in action 
mills said that when he spoke to chapters of the organization 
upon his return he found them mainly interested in hearing what 
vietnam is like now 
two veterans who have gone on the tours spoke glowingly of their 
experiences at the news conference 
i found out that despite all of our efforts we werent able to 
kill the whole country said greg kleven 40 of concord calif 
a former marine its still alive alive and well 
mark mccausland 38 of munroe falls ohio an army veteran who 
lost an arm and a leg in a rocket attack in vietnam said the 
image that i have of vietnam now is of a peaceful green little 
country where the image i had before was of a place that was 
deadly 
it would be a real shame to allow anybody to prevent other 
veterans from going through the same process mccausland said 
mccausland said he believed it would be nearly impossible for 
most veterans to return to vietnam on their own because of the 
expense and paperwork involved 
myers said the organized tours last about three weeks from 
home town to home town and cost 2700 including transportation 
meals and accommodations 
steven i pinter chief of licensing for the treasury 
departments office of foreign assets control wrote mills and 
myers on feb 10 directing them to immediately terminate 
performing any activities involving travel tours to vietnam 
the letter said violation of the regulations carries a maximum 
penalty of a 50000 fine and 10 years imprisonment 
on may 15 lindblad travel inc of westport conn pleaded 
guilty in us district court in connecticut to unlawfully 
arranging a group tour of vietnam and cambodia sentencing was set 
for june 14 one of the customers booking the tour was an 
undercover agent of the customs service 
in a news release about the lindblad case on wednesday 
salvatore r martoche assistant secretary of the treasury for 
enforcement said this case should send a strong message that 
violations of the vietnam and cambodia sanctions program will not 
be tolerated 
martoche said the customs service and office of foreign assets 
control will continue to work closely with the department of 
justice to pursue a vigorous enforcement program against violations 
of these and other embargoes

bush administration officials are trying to 
decide how to handle a congressmans threat to hold up aid for 
latin america unless officials concede they misled lawmakers about 
us efforts to win thirdcountry help for nicaraguan rebels 
state department and white house officials met thursday to 
discuss a letter rep david obey dwis chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations sent to 
secretary of state james a baker iii said a congressional source 
who asked not to be named 
an administration official confirmed discussions were being held 
on the letter 
obey complained that his committee which acts on the 
administrations requests for foreign aid was clearly misled by 
administration spokesmen in the past concerning the linkage of us 
aid to the contras 
he asked baker to provide him with a letter for the record to 
show that the administration understands that so we can move on to 
other business 
i would hope that this matter could be cleared up by a simple 
letter so that further hearings would not be required before we 
vote on aid to latin america he said 
obey pointed out that time is short since the vote is expected 
to take place within the next two weeks 
further hearings could delay the vote on the administrations 
request for some 700 million in central american aid for fiscal 
1990 said an obey aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states has backed the contra rebels since 1981 in 
their fight to oust the leftist government in nicaragua 
documents that surfaced at former white house aide oliver 
norths recent trial and other information would seem to justify 
a committee conclusion that aid to honduras guatemala el salvador 
and costa rica was used as leverage to get those countries to help 
the contras and circumvent a 1984 congressional ban on such 
assistance obey wrote 
he also noted that michael kozak acting assistant secretary of 
state for latin america testified before obeys panel last month 
that a plan to expedite aid to honduras in return for its promise 
to help the rebels was never carried out 
but clearly it was obey said 
obey said he wrote to kozak asking him to clear up discrepancies 
between his testimony and other documents but did not receive an 
answer 
if the administration has other documents which can back up 
kozaks contentions they should be supplied to the committee 
immediately obey said

a federal appeals court is calling for a 
review of a labor unions challenge to increase teaching workloads 
at overseas schools 
at issue are additional duties for teachers at 250 schools for 
children of us military personnel operated by a unit of the 
defense department 
the appeals court on thursday reversed a decision of the federal 
labor relations authority that had supported the defense 
departments refusal to bargain with the teachers about the extra 
work 
the authority never measured the impact of managements 
changes upon the employees said the ruling by us court of 
appeals judge spottswood robinson 
in 1984 administrators with the department of defense dependent 
schools announced changes that would reduce hiring of substitute 
teachers thereby requiring fulltime teachers were to fill in 
hiring of outside help to monitor lunchrooms and playgrounds also 
would be discontinued with fulltime teachers and professionals 
handling these chores additional work was subsequently instituted 
for compensatory education programs as well 
the overseas education association submitted proposals designed 
to minimize the effect of the changes dodds bargained on some of 
them but refused to do so on others 
the labor relations authority upheld the defense department 
unit saying the unions proposals interfered directly with 
managements reserved right to assign work 
the union however said its proposals qualified for bargaining 
because they involved adverselyaffected employees 
the extra duties said the union forced the teachers do some 
work on their own time at home 
the authority missed the point completely said the judge 
robinson and two judges who concurred in a separate opinion 
reversed the authoritys decisions and sent the cases back for 
further consideration

air traffic controllers say their hours are 
too long and they have to watch too many planes in the sky but 
transportation secretary samuel skinner says the system they run is 
the safest in the world 
a survey released by a congressional subcommittee thursday shows 
widespread discontent among the men and women who sit at screens 
and help guide the airplanes from airport to airport 
morale is horrible traffic intolerable management 
insensitive were overworked understaffed and abused said one 
unidentified controller who responded to the survey by the general 
accounting office 
an air traffic control supervisor was quoted as saying there are 
busy hours at major hubs when the system teeters on the brink of 
being unsafe 
sixtyfive percent of controllers responding to the survey felt 
they handled too much traffic 59 percent thought they were 
required to work too long without a break and 43 percent said 
their morale was low 
the survey by gao which is congress investigative arm was 
based on 5098 questionnaires filled out late last year by 
controllers and supervisors at the federal aviation 
administrations 84 largest facilities those responding made up 
about onethird of the workforce 
the survey included analysis by an independent consulting group 
the flight safety foundation that said the system is safe but the 
margin of safety is narrow 
the report detailing results of the survey was titled serious 
problems continue to trouble the air traffic control work force 
the results indicate that little has changed in the system since 
1985 when a similar survey was conducted with nearly identical 
responses 
the latest figures on air traffic controllers show their number 
has for the first time exceeded the 16244 that worked before a 
1981 strike that brought the firing of 70 percent of the workforce 
but house members said and the faa confirmed that there are 
still 3600 fewer full performance controllers than eight years 
ago and their number recently has dwindled further the 
controllers qualified to handle radar and other critical tasks 
numbered 9689 at the end of last month compared to 9858 last 
sept 30 when the controller survey was completed 
sitting at a computer terminal in his office that shows the 
minutebyminute location of every commercial flight over the 
continental united states skinner praised the system 
before demonstrating the terminal which is hooked up to the air 
traffic control system skinner said he has talked to more 
controllers around the country than any previous secretary and 
believes morale is high 
he acknowledged some discontent over inadequate pay scales at 
larger more complex operations and said morale is affected 
somewhat by outdated equipment 
the system is bulging at the seams but its still the safest 
system in the world skinner said 
acting faa head robert e whittington told the subcommittee the 
agencys own surveys show high employee job satisfaction 
overall the morale of our controller work force is good 
although it varies from facility to facility and does not remain 
static over time whittington said 
the survey said traffic volume has grown by 30 percent to 40 
percent at major airports since the controllers strike 
our equipment level is in a word prehistoric said one 
controller quoted by gao official kenneth m mead who summarized 
the survey for the subcommittee 
mead said controllers and supervisors were given assurances of 
confidentiality when they filled out the survey forms

a miniature city built 75 years ago as a 
play town for a businessmans daughter opens saturday after a 
sprucing up and its operators hope it will once again be a top 
tourist attraction 
tiny town is located about five miles southwest of denver and 
boasts more than 70 buildings many are miniature replicas of 
denver historical buildings such as the citys first fire station 
the first telephone office mrs murphys boarding house some 
landmark mansions and some businesses 
twenty of the buildings most of which are little taller than 
an adults waist are the originals that george turner built for 
his daughter as a fantasy village beginning in 1915 
on a hillside across turkey creek from the main village are 
several replicas of old mining structures similar to those still in 
place around such historical mining towns as central city and 
cripple creek 
on saturday a colorado ballet performance in the tiny village 
once known as turnerville will mark tiny towns emergence from the 
tall mountain weeds that shrouded it for several years 
tiny town was closed for the better part of five years for 
renovation by volunteers working for the nonprofit tiny town 
foundation 
the town was opened to the public on selected weekends last 
summer and when 11000 people visited during the first one the 
group decided it better prepare for bigger crowds than anticipated 
research indicates it is the oldest miniature town in the united 
states says bob kintzele a longtime tiny town fan who helped with 
the restoration 
the village is still for children said kintzele 
they come up here and you dont have to tell them this is for 
kids he said 
george turners creation which grew from a few small buildings 
in 1915 to about 125 by 1925 was one of the states top three 
tourist attractions behind buffalo bill codys grave and pikes 
peak 
at one time a tiny working railroad wound its way around the 
town and back and forth across turkey creek on miniature trestles 
the steampowered locomotive had a miniature roundhouse where it 
turned around and spent the winter 
tiny town survived damaging floods in 1929 and 1932 and a fire 
that swept up turkey creek canyon in 1935 destroying the principal 
buildings although leaving the miniature buildings intact in 1969 
a flood left behind a debrisstrewn ghost town 
the biggest disaster was in 1948 when us 285 which ran next 
to tiny town was rerouted taking the village out of sight out 
of mind kintzele said 
turner who ran a moving company sold the town in 1927 
one of the towns restorations was by lyle fulkerson who bought 
the town in 1972 fulkerson a model train buff and master 
mechanic widened and deepened turkey creek to prevent furture 
floods and regraded the railroad bed 
but five years later fulkerson was killed when his car was hit 
by a runaway train while he was traveling from denver to tiny town 
the next year tiny town lost its lease and fell into disrepair it 
was closed to the public in 1983 
age also took its toll on the tiny town railroad the caboose 
and a few cars are still usable but the track and track bed need 
replacing and the locomotive must be rebuilt with parts impossible 
to find said kintzele he said it would cost 100000 to put the 
railroad back in operation 
that part of the operation is still in the future he said the 
train made on a bigger scale than the rest of the town to 
accommodate children who arent onesixth scale wont run 
during the 1989 season but will be there for visitors to see he 
said

the 11th us circuit court of appeals on wednesday found no 
merit in lindseys request for a stay according to court spokesman 
matt davidson 
the governors legal adviser bill wasden said before hunts 
decision that clemency could only be granted if there were 
evidence that was not presented at the trial that was so 
overwhelming as to preclude every other possibility but innocence

wednesday with lindseys sister and spoke by telephone with his 
mother who lives in california the governor who is traveling 
around the state did not attend the meeting

americans are learning more about aids but it may 
be years before this increased knowledge slows the spread of the 
disease according to a federal study 
the oneyear survey of public awareness by the federal centers 
for disease controls national center for health statistics showed 
an increase of people who know aids is spread through sexual 
intercourse and not from casual contact with infected persons 
but people can be infected with the aids virus for 10 years 
before symptoms appear complicating detection of the disease said 
marcie cynamon of the nchs division of health interview statistics 
near bethesda md 
the study released thursday was based on about 3500 interviews 
a month from august 1987 to august 1988 and administered by the 
us census bureau 
the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report said that the 
percentage of parents who discussed aids with their children 
remained constant at about 60 percent but that those reporting 
their children had aids education in schools was up from 36 percent 
to 59 percent 
over the period of the survey the percentage of adults 
correctly answering that it was definitely true that aids was 
an infectious viral disease increased from 44 percent to 64 percent 
other findings of the study included 
those who knew it is very unlikely or impossible to contract 
aids by working near someone who has the disease increased from 53 
percent to 67 percent 
the percentage of people putting considerable trust in the use 
of condoms or restricting relations to one uninfected partner

laws aimed at making polluters pay for oil

hasnt been willing to spend enough to assess the damages 
environmental lawyers say 
state environmental prosecutors from new york and massachusetts 
told a house subcommittee thursday that interior department 
regulations coupled with the lack of funds for assessment studies 
actually obstruct more than enhance efforts to make polluters pay 
the rules so severely limited the damages collectable that to

more stringent regulations on cancercausing chemicals in food 
especially in processed fruits and vegetables often consumed by 
small children 
al meyerhoff an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the suit is aimed at forcing the epa to be more 
aggresive in prohibiting the use of pesticides on food and to ban 
them altogether if they are found to cause cancer 
under current epa procedures the agency allows the use of some 
older pesticides even though agency officials concede that if the 
same chemicals were newly introduced they would not be approved 
because of health concerns 
in addition to the natural resources defense council plaintiffs 
in the lawsuit are public citizen a private environmental and

many doctors say they would lie to a patients 
family if their errors had led to the patients death a study on 
deception in the medical profession shows 
the survey published today in the journal of the american 
medical association said many doctors would engage in various forms 
of deception to help themselves or to protect patients 
the lead researcher said the results should not signal distrust 
in physicians 
people who read the study superficially might think my god 
you cant trust your doctor anymore theyre deceptive said dr 
dennis h novack 
i would challenge that said novack an associate professor 
of community health at brown university program of medicine in 
providence ri 
more than twothirds of doctors surveyed indicated a willingness 
to help patients get insurance benefits by misrepresenting a test 
according to the study 
doctors appear to justify their decisions in terms of the 
consequences and to place a higher value on their patients welfare 
and keeping patients confidences than on truthtelling for its own 
sake the researchers said 
but under extreme circumstances some physicians would 
consider deceiving to benefit themselves 
more than onethird of the doctors surveyed for the article 
indicated they would offer incomplete or misleading information to 
the family of a very sick patient after making a mistake that led 
to the patients death 
such behavior is not necessarily unethical said daniel 
callahan director of the hastings center of briarcliff manor 
ny a research institute that studies ethical problems in 
medicine callahan a nonphysician was not involved in the study 
i think it is inevitable physicians are fallible and we need 
to understand their fallibility he said i think they dont 
have to reveal their errors to patients 
novack said 80 percent of respondents indicated they rarely or 
never use deception in their own practices the hypothetical 
cases posed some of the hardest cases they could have he said 
in a telephone interview thursday 
the researchers presented four hypothetical problems to 211 
physicians in an unspecified northeast state the doctors answered 
multiplechoice questions about what courses of action they would 
choose and why 
more than half of the doctors said they would permit a patient 
who had contracted gonorrhea from a prostitute to mislead his wife 
not the doctors patient about the nature of the disease 
the deception involved letting the patient tell his wife the 
disease was a nonspecific urethritis not acquired through sex 
that way the patient could have his wife get treatment without 
jeopardizing his marriage 
less than 10 percent of the physicians said they would deceive a 
mother to avoid revealing an adolescent daughters pregnancy while 
more than 30 percent said they would leave the decision entirely up 
to the girl 
callahan said tradition favors allowing the patient to decide 
if theres any firm rule in medicine probably the most firm 
rule it is that doctors need to maintain patient 
confidentiality he said in a telephone interview refusing to 
break a medical confidence has never been called deception

memorial day holiday weekend and the national safety council 
predicts that up to 470 people would die in traffic accidents 
traditionally memorial day means increased traffic on the 
highways bernard hyland of the chicagobased council said 
thursday 
the holiday travel period begins at 6 pm friday and runs until 
midnight monday the safety council predicted that between 370 and 
470 people would die in traffic accidents 
last year there were 404 traffic fatalities for the threeday 
weekend the memorial day record was set in 1968 when 629 people 
were killed in traffic accidents over a fourday weekend the 
threeday record of 597 was set in 1969 
although gasoline prices have risen nationwide in the past two 
months the safety council said it was unable to say whether that 
would keep more people off the highways 
its hard to say said terry miller of the councils 
statistical bureau nobody knows for sure if the mileage goes 
down the accidents and fatalities would go down but nobody knows 
how the public will react to the increased prices

deputies to the new soviet congress today 
quarreled over legal restrictions on demonstrations after a deputy 
complained that antiriot forces were deployed to break up a public 
meeting 
conservatives won the fight and a ban on public gatherings in 
moscow remained in effect 
minutes after the congress of peoples deputies convened for a 
second day sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya told her colleagues 
that voters had called her early today to report that special 
forces broke up a gathering on moscows pushkin square 
she said the crowd had assembled to meet deputies from the new 
congress and demanded the body vote to lift a ban on unauthorized 
public gatherings for the duration of the congress inaugural 
session 
soviet law permits city authorities to ban parades and 
demonstrations to maintain public order the restrictions often are 
invoked against unofficial political activities 
yuri mityunov a spokesman for the democratic union a 
selfstyled opposition party with a few thousand members across the 
country told the associated press that thursdays latenight 
meeting was called to appeal for more democracy and to meet moscow 
deputies 
there were no arrests but the police behaved very 
aggressively he said 
mikhail s gorbachev who was chosen president by the congress 
on thursday called interior minister vadim bakatin to the podium 
after zaslavskayas speech 
bakatin said voters had gathered nationwide to discuss the first 
day of the congress and no incidents were reported 
but the moscow meeting was different he said because city 
authorities had banned it in advance 
bakatins statement touched off a noisy quarrel on the floor of 
the congress whose televised proceedings are part of the soviet 
unions democratic reforms 
conservatives from central asia applauded loudly to drown out 
podium statements by moscow reformers sergei stankevich and andrei 
d sakharov the human rights activist 
stankevich 35 said he went to the square which in recent 
months has become a gathering place for political debate and 
frequent site of demonstrations and found more than 2000 people 
surrounded by police and special antiriot forces 
sakharov said he went to the square thursday night after a 
crying girl telephoned him from the site 
i spoke to these people it was a very good conversation about 
the problems of the congress he said these are our young 
people our future actively interested in the congress they asked 
us to go there every day after the end of debates 
we must not surround these people with police units 
sakharov said recalling that at least 20 people died in soviet 
georgia last month after security forces broke up a 
proindependence demonstration 
gorbachev as presiding officer of the congress moved to 
resolve the dispute by putting to a vote ms zaslavskayas request 
that moscow city authorities lift the ban on unauthorized public 
meetings while the congress meets 
during the balloting gorbachev announced he had received word 
from moscow communist party boss lev n zaikov that city 
authorities would permit meetings at luzhniki a large park and 
stadium area in western moscow 
that did not satisfy mityunov who said his group will meet in 
pushkin square anyway and the conservatives in the congress held 
sway 
the vote was 1261831 against lifting the ban 30 deputies 
abstained

technicians today prepared a delta 2 
for its fifth launch attempt as troubleshooters studied an 
electrical problem that stopped the rocket a second before liftoff 
air force officials predict it will be at least wednesday before 
they try again to launch the 20 million delta 2 which is to carry 
a military navigation satellite into orbit for the united states 
and its allies 
experts concluded thursday that an electrical problem at the 
launch pad caused a computer to shut down the main engine of the 
delta 2 engineers investigating the aborted launch determined 
that its cause is most likely an electrical problem and they 
highly suspect ground equipment said capt ken warren an air 
force spokesman 
a team of engineers from the air force and the rockets maker 
mcdonnell douglas astronautics co of huntington beach calif was 
assembled after the scrubbed takeoff wednesday night of the delta 2 
and its 65 milion payload a navstar global positioning satellite 
a source who requested anonymity said experts found nothing 
wrong with the rocket and are investigating the possibility that 
thunderstorms which forced three previous launch postponements 
may have caused a problem in the launch pads circuitry 
officials said a valve stuck shut and starved the delta 2s main 
engine of liquid oxygen which mixes with a kerosenetype fuel to 
propel the rocket a computer discovered the closed valve and shut 
the engine off before it could ignite 
launch controllers had sent an engine ignition command but it 
never reached the fuel valve an open electrical circuit apparently 
blocked the command according to a source 
the navstar satellite will tell us and allied military units 
their location within 50 feet on land at sea or in the air 
anywhere on the globe launch attempts on saturday sunday and 
tuesday were scrubbed

the worst violence at folsom prison in 
seven years left one inmate dead and five seriously injured 
prison officials said 25 to 30 inmates battled thursday morning 
in an exercise yard occupied by about 300 prisoners several had 
weapons made within the prison 
spokeswoman lt cammy voss said three suffered gunshot wounds 
and two stab wounds the guards fired 10 shots from their 
secondstory posts to break up the brawl 
a strip search of all prisoners in the yard revealed 43 men with 
minor wounds but officers said some of those probably happened 
earlier and elsewhere but hadnt yet been reported 
the fight appeared to have been racially motivated voss said 
mostly black and hispanic prisoners and a couple of white prisoners 
were involved 
but it was apparently not gangrelated she said we dont 
know why it erupted she added 
the slain inmate was identified as michael coleman 29 he had 
arrived april 20 to begin a fouryear term for armed robbery in los 
angeles county he died of stab wounds 20 minutes after the fight 
began 
officers locked all of the maximumsecurity prisons 7000 
inmates into their cells after the fight broke out at the prison 20 
miles east of sacramento 
facility b where the melee occurred is one of three in a wing 
that opened in october 1986 next to the 119yearold stone walls 
it houses about 1000 prisoners considered to be among 
californias most violent 
voss said it was the worst violence in the history of the new 
wing and perhaps the worst at the entire folsom prison since seven 
years ago when racial violence largely between hispanic and black 
prison gang members led to an extended lockup

bigevent programming for may and expiration of 
the effects of the 1988 scriptwriters strike helped the three 
networks at least slow the rate of audience erosion that has 
plagued them in recent seasons 
the networks had a combined average audience share of 65 for the 
may sweep 2 percent lower than may 1988 according to ac nielsen 
co ratings their combined rating was 378 compared with 387 in 
may 1988 
the decline was less than the 3 percent rate of audience loss 
the networks suffered in the 198889 season compared with the 
198788 season that loss has been chalked up to the effects of the 
strike which delayed the start of the season and inroads by 
cable videocassettes and independent channels 
may is one of four sweeps months a year when local 
television ratings are measured for use in negotiating future 
advertising rates the networks tend to load their schedules with 
special programming to help local affiliates 
nbc which just completed its fourth season win in a row won 
the may sweep too with an average rating of 146 cbs had an 
118 even though abc had the two toprated shows in the sweep the 
madefortv movie everybodys baby the rescue of jessica 
mcclure and the sitcom roseanne it came in third with an 
114 
nbcs twoparter i know my first name is steven was the 
highestrated multipart movie of the sweep with a 245 rating and 
39 share it was the highestrated multiparter for nbc since 
fatal vision in november 1984 and the highestrated 
multiparter on any network since lonesome dove on cbs in 
february 
abcs fivepart conclusion of war and remembrance was the 
second highestrated multiparter of the sweep though it had a 
soso 149 rating 
everybodys baby based on the reallife 1987 rescue of a 
midland texas baby from an abandoned water well had a 229 
rating and 36 share to become the toprated show of the sweep 
abcs roseanne beat out nbcs the cosby show for second 
place which nbc attributed to the effects of sunlight cosby 
had a lower rating but higher share because of its 8 pm edt 
time period fewer people are in front of their sets in the early 
evening because its still light outside roseanne has a 9 pm 
time period and despite the performance of roseanne which was 
preempted at times during the sweep abc lost tuesday night to nbc 
nbc won its 16th sweep in 17 sweeps abc had broken its winning 
streak in february 1988 with the winter olympics nbc has become 
such a juggernaut it is having a hard time finding new 
superlatives 
gerald jaffe nbcs vice president for research projects said 
he was so impressed that nbc had won five nights a week during the 
may sweep he had his staff check to see when a network last 
accomplished that feat the answer nbc in the last sweep in 
february

syria has reinforced its 40000 troops in 
lebanon with an armored tank brigade and syrian fighter planes 
flew over christian positions today israeli and lebanese media 
reported 
israels cabinet met in special session to discuss the troop 
moves israel radio said an israeli official who requested 
anonymity confirmed a special cabinet session was convened 
thursday night but refused to give details 
israeli officials said they were watching the situation closely 
but saw no reason to interfere as long as israels northern border 
was not affected 
as long as we dont feel directly threatened there is no way 
israel is going to intervene said foreign ministry spokesman 
alon liel 
it was not immediately clear how the syrian moves would affect 
the fighting in lebanon more than 350 people have been killed and 
nearly 1400 wounded since christian and moslem forces began 
shelling each others positions march 8 in the latest round of 
fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the syrian reinforcements also came as the arab league met in 
morocco to discuss ways of enforcing a ceasefire it declared in 
lebanon on may 11 
a spokesman for christian forces in lebanon said two israeli 
warplanes flew over the chouf mountains southeast of beirut today 
and drew heavy antiaircraft fire from syrianbacked druse 
militiamen no hits were observed he said 
the media reports did not say how many additional syrian troops 
were moved into eastern lebanon but the daily yediot ahronot said 
they included 40 tanks the troop movements were part of an 
exercise involving helicopter commandos backed by aircraft and 
tanks the newspaper and radio reports said 
the syrian exercise was reportedly taking place in the bekaa 
valley near the syrian border and not near the golan heights which 
would be of major concern to israel but christian radio reports in 
lebanon said syrian aircraft were flying over beirut and the 
christian enclave 
a spokesman for the christian army commander gen michel aoun 
said four syrian jet fighters flew at high altitudes from the 
northern border to beirut for more than an hour beginning at 615 
am 
they veered off over beirut and headed back north they 
carried out the practice repeatedly said the spokesman 
he said christian army units did not open fire at the jets 
motta gur a former army chief of staff said on israel radio 
that the troop movements seemed more a political move aimed at arab 
leaders attending the arab league summit in casablanca than a 
threat to israels security 
we have to watch the situation closely but in my assessment 
its more an innerarab issue the fact is that in casablanca they 
got into difficulties he said the summit is trying to find a 
compromise to syrias refusal to end its fight with christian armed 
forces 
syria has rejected calls from iraq to withdraw its forces from 
lebanon to help end that nations civil war syrian soldiers have 
been in lebanon since 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate 
israel maintains a sixto10milewide security zone in southern 
lebanon 
military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said israel 
had not raised the alert status of its troops along the border 
syrias movement of antiaircraft missiles into lebanon in 1981 
touched off a crisis and the two armies clashed during israels 
invasion of lebanon in 1982 tensions also increased after syria 
sent troops back into beirut

a judge today sentenced 14 
black people to death in the 1985 killing of a black police officer 
who was beaten and set on fire by a mob 
the defendants singing an african hymn as they marched into 
court in the northwest city of upington were among 25 people 
convicted of murder in the slaying of police constable lucas 
sethwala in nearby paballelo township 
under south african law the death sentence is mandatory for 
people convicted of murder unless the judge determines there were 
mitigating circumstances 
the 11 other defendants are to be sentenced next week but the 
judge already has determined there were extenuating circumstances 
and the death penalty will not be imposed sentencing also is 
scheduled for a 26th defendant convicted of attempted murder 
most of the 13 men and one women sentenced to death today 
proclaimed their innocence during the hearing before supreme court 
justice jan basson 
i am an elderly woman and have been found guilty for something 
i have not done other people committed this crime said 
evelina de bruin 60 
only one of the 25 justice bekebeke was found to have 
committed the act that killed sethwala said defense lawyer andy 
durbach 
she said the sentences will be appealed the group is the 
largest ever sentenced to death in a single crime in south africa 
she said 
bekebeke 24 did not maintain his innocence in his address to 
the court today but said the case was based on racial prejudice 
because the death sentence is mandatory the defendants knew 
their sentences because the judge already had ruled on thursday 
that there were no extenuating circumstances 
prosecutors said the 25 people were part of a crowd of 300 who 
pelted the victims house with stones at one point he fired a gun 
out the window wounding a small boy which defense lawyers said 
incited the crowd to assault the man and set him on fire 
basson noted that 3000 people had gathered on a soccer field in 
the township the previous day to protest rent hikes and other 
actions by township authorities he said the killing was 
politically motivated part of a conspiracy to attack authorities 
he rejected defense arguments that the individual defendants 
could not be held accountable for the actions of the crowd one of 
those convicted was described by witnesses as a best friend of the 
victim 
defense lawyer anton lubowski said 10 defendants were sentenced 
to death but found to not have physically contributed to the 
officers death 
the 25 were convicted of murder in april 1988 under the 
principle of common purpose which holds them responsible for the 
actions of a crowd if they were part of the group 
the same principle was used against the sharpeville six a group 
of black men and women convicted of slaying a black town council 
member during the nationwide political unrest that gripped black 
townships from 198486 
after an international campaign president pw botha last year 
commuted the death sentences for the sharpeville six and replaced 
them with lengthy prison terms

the illinois senate shot down a package 
of measures that would have toughened handgun laws and imposed a 
limited ban on semiautomatic assault weapons 
by a 21 margin lawmakers thursday defeated bills requiring 
handgun owners to register their weapons with state police obtain 
identification cards and notify authorities of change of address 
the senate fell two votes short of banning semiautomatic weapons 
using magazines or ammunition belts containing more than 10 rounds 
california recently enacted a similar ban 
people are more concerned with the will of the national rifle 
association than they are of the desires of their own 
constituents said william marovitz one of two sponsors of the 
bills 
sen david barkhausen said the bills proposal to register the 
guns would have cost 76 million and created a bureaucratic 
nightmare 
currently people may own any type of firearm with a single 
firearm owners identification card the rejected measure would 
have required a separate card for handguns 
the senate did approve a measure sponsored by marovitz that 
would allow revocation of a firearm owners identification card if 
a judge determines that the owner presents a clear and present 
danger to himself or others 
another rejected measure would have banned former mental 
patients from owning handguns 
gun control advocates had hoped their efforts would gain after 
incidents like the shooting spree last may 20 in a winnetka 
elementary school laurie dann a mentally disturbed woman shot 
five students killing one before committing suicide

consumer spending shot up 11 percent in 
april the biggest advance in nearly a year outpacing a 04 
percent increase in personal income the government reported today 
the combination of a strong spending increase and the sluggish 
income gain produced a sharp reduction in the personal savings 
rate which dropped to 53 percent last month from a threeyear 
high of 63 percent during the previous month the commerce 
department said 
the april increase in personal income was the smallest gain 
since income fell 02 percent last november personal income had 
risen a strong 08 percent in march and 10 percent in february 
last months increase in personal income to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 437 trillion would have been stronger 
were it not for decreases in farm subsidies over the past two 
months coupled with bonuses for autoworkers and retroactive social 
security benefit payments that inflated marchs figure 
excluding those special factors personal income advanced a 
strong 08 percent in april after rising 07 percent in march 
the 11 percent increase in personal consumer expenditures to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342 trillion was the biggest 
advance since a 13 percent increase was registered last june 
expenditures had risen just 03 percent in march and 04 percent 
in february causing analysts to attribute part of the current 
slowdown in economic growth to slackening consumer spending 
consumer spending is closely watched as indicator of the 
economys health because it accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity 
the rebound in spending last month was partly attributed to a 
rise in auto sales which perked up somewhat in april after 
carmakers launched a round of rebates and cutrate financing deals 
to lure customers back to showrooms 
the pickup in auto sales was the primary power behind a 32 
percent increase last month in consumer spending on durable goods 
big ticket items expected to last at least three years 
spending on durable goods last month rose to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4671 trillion after declining during the 
previous two months when auto sales had been weak 
purchases of nondurable goods meanwhile rose 07 percent last 
month and spending on services rose 08 percent 
disposable or aftertax income held virtually even last month 
after rising 03 percent in march aftertax income was held down 
by a higherthanusual april surge in federal income tax payments 
that was partly attributed to the aftereffects of the 1986 tax 
overhaul 
the increase in tax payments contributed to the decline in the 
personal savings rate which represents savings as a percentage of 
aftertax income 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income rose 06 
percent in april to a seasonally adjusted 261 trillion on an 
annual basis

prosecutors have dropped sexabuse charges 
against a former daycare center operator who said she was elated 
but felt violated by more than two years of investigations and 
a trial 
sandra fabiano had been charged with sexually abusing four 
preschoolage girls at her two daycare centers in suburban 
chicago the first trial involving one of the girls ended in 
acquittal march 30 
mary ellen cagney and richard burke assistant cook county 
states attorneys said the remaining charges were dropped thursday 
to spare child witnesses from the trauma of a trial 
i feel like a champagne bottle has just been opened said 
mrs fabiano 42 
i am a free woman now but i felt that i didnt have any 
rights throughout the whole thing she said i felt i was 
violated as was my family and my children 
she accused prosecutors of mishandling the case and said she 
believes the charges were dropped because the state had no evidence 
in the remaining cases 
but ms cagney said the investigation was very thorough and 
sensitive to the rights of the family 
she was not locked up ms cagney said we were very aware 
of her rights and those of her family throughout the 
investigation 
mrs fabianos lawyers have filed a lawsuit asking that a judge 
overturn the states decision to revoke her daycare license and 
the parents of the four girls have sued mrs fabiano 
the investigation began in april 1987 when the mother of the 
child involved in the first trial said her 3yearold daughter had 
said that teacher sandy did something to me 
mrs fabiano said she hoped dismissal of the charges would 
inspire new laws protecting teachers and others who work with 
children from unfounded charges of sexual abuse i would never 
want to see anyone else go through this she said

president daniel ortega said he 
ordered the expulsion of two us diplomats to teach the us 
government to respect nicaraguas sovereignty 
ortega said he acted so that the united states understands 
that there is a space that it must respect the pair he charged 
were meddling in the countrys internal affairs 
ortega spoke thursday to a group of coffee workers in matagalpa 
85 miles northeast of the nations capital 
the sandinsta government announced the expulsions thursday 
saying it believes the diplomats instigated wildcat teachers 
strikes 
this shows the united states government is committed to 
disobeying the norms of civilized coexistence and is pledged to 
destabilizing governments such as the one in nicaragua foreign 
minister miguel descoto said thursday 
in washington the state department said the charges were 
totally false and without any credible foundation 
clearly the government of nicaragua is embarrassed by the fact 
that teachers in nicaragua are on strike against conditions in that 
country press officer dennis harter said 
he suggested the action was to divert attention from the fact 
that the teachers strike is being waged by a traditionally 
prosandinista trade union 
ortega said thursday we are conscious that the teachers are 
badly paid like ther rest of the workers but he added the 
aggressive us policy is responsible for nicaraguas current 
economic crisis 
he specifically blamed a us trade embargo and washingtons 
support for rightwing nicaraguan rebels known as the contras 
government spokesman dionisio marenco identified the diplomats 
ordered expelled as kathleen williamson barmon us attache for 
central american labor affairs and economic attache joel franklin 
cassman 
cassman was given 72 hours to leave and ms barmon 48 hours 
she is based in honduras but had been in nicaragua for two days 
marenco said cassman arrived in nicaragua last week with six other 
us officials replacing seven american diplomats expelled last 
year 
marenco said the two went around distributing money and 
exhorting the teachers to strike

former vice president walter f mondale said 
today he will not enter the 1990 race for a us senate seat in 
minnesota and will not seek any other elective office in the future 
i believe its time for other candidates to step forward 
said mondale a former senator who was the democratic partys 
presidential nominee in 1984 it was a very difficult choice for 
us 
mondale 61 said he has enjoyed his life out of political 
office and has seen too many colleagues remain in the senate for 
too long he was considering running against incumbent rudy 
boschwitz a republican 
im at peace with myself mondale said we took a lot of 
time making this decision and its a basic one its a lot easier 
deciding when to get into politics as opposed to when to leave 
a poll commissioned by mondale indicated that the former vice 
president could defeat boschwitz in the 1990 race the poll 
released by mondales son ted mondale shows mondale leading 
boschwitz 51 percent to 40 percent with 8 percent undecided 
fritz mondale clearly would have been the toughest competitor 
i could have had boschwitz told a news conference in st paul 
i certainly do have a sense of relief that he will not be the 
competitor 
mondale a protege of the late hubert h humphrey generally had 
been considered the most formidable candidate democrats could field 
against boschwitz a twoterm senator mondales announcement was 
expected to result in an immediate scramble among minnesota 
democrats for the 1990 senate endorsement 
the only announced challenger to boschwitz is democratic 
national committee member paul wellstone a political science 
professor at carleton college and a leader of the rev jesse 
jacksons 1988 presidential campaign in minnesota 
boschwitz 58 was elected to the senate in 1978 
mondale represented minnesota in the senate from 1965 until 
1976 when he left to be jimmy carters vice president he ran 
unsuccessfully for president against ronald reagan in 1984 
speculation that he planned to run again began in june 1987 
when mondale moved from washington dc back to minnesota to 
practice law with a minneapolis firm 
mondale said today he was certain two years ago that he would 
not be tempted by yet another race for political office but he 
said he considered running against boschwitz because he loved 
public life and the us senate and believed he would have a strong 
chance of winning 
mondale said he decided two days ago after seeking advice from 
numerous friends and associates to end his political career 
he and his wife joan spent more than 30 years in the 
political pressure cooker mondale said 
for the first time in our lives we have time to enjoy private 
life to be with our family and friends and time to pursue our 
other interests that we could never do before he said 
i am finding that i can be heard on public matters while 
remaining in private life 
mondale said those from whom he sought counsel were nearly 
unanimous in urging him to run but nearly all of them also said 
they would understand if he didnt

a summit of arab leaders today 
dropped a demand that syria withdraw its troops from beirut after 
encountering fierce opposition from the syrians conference 
officials said 
instead the conference called for a revision of lebanons 
constitution and left as a gentlemans agreement the withdrawal 
of syrian soldiers from the capital said iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz 
the revised constitution would involve political reforms that 
could be considered the basis for national reconciliation in 
lebanon split by 14 years of civil war 
lebanese moslems now a majority in the country claim the 
constitution reserves too much power for christians who were 
dominant when lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 
the withdrawal provision had been written into a resolution 
adopted early today but it was deleted when leaders of the 
22member arab league met to draft the final communique from their 
fourday summit 
syrias president hafez assad argued bitterly over the lebanon 
issue with president saddam hussein of iraq iraq is the main 
backer of the christian forces and wanted a full syrian withdrawal 
from lebanon 
aziz told reporters the resolution fell short of what must be 
done on this important issue if it works we shall be pleased but 
if it doesnt we shall convene again here and deal with the whole 
matter more satisfactorily and get a full mandate to take all the 
necessary measures 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate and they have joined forces with moslem 
militias fighting the mainly christian troops of army gen michel 
aoun 
the summit entered its final hours amid news reports syria had 
reinforced its troops in lebanon jerusalems yediot ahronot said 
an additional 40 syrian tanks were moved into lebanon along with 
an undetermined number of troops 
an early draft of the summits resolution called for a 
committee led by moroccos king hassan ii to oversee the 
withdrawal of syrian forces from beirut within three months 
lastminute syrian stalling tactics forced the removal of that 
provision from the resolution said conference sources speaking on 
condition they not be named 
aziz made it clear that iraq considered the withdrawal to be 
implicit and mandatory and sources said the resolution still could 
be changed before this afternoons closing plenary meeting 
the earlier version also called for elections within three 
months to choose a government of national unity in lebanon the 
revision called for the committee led by hassan to oversee revision 
of lebanons constitution within six months this would presumably 
include elections 
the summit was extended a day as delegates sought agreement on 
lebanon where arab leaguesponsored ceasefires have failed to 
stop fighting between christians and the syrianbacked moslems 
more than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1400 wounded 
since christian and moslem forces began shelling each others 
positions march 8 in the latest round of fighting 
the summit saw some spectacular reconciliations particularly 
between libyas leader moammar gadhafi and egypts leader hosni 
mubarak at his first arab summit in 10 years one session had to 
be delayed as mubarak and gadhafi concluded a 3hour reunion 
meeting 
the summit convened tuesday to welcome egypt back to the arab 
fold after a 10year ostracism for making peace with israel

disgraced prime minister noboru takeshita will stay 
in office longer than expected because the governing party has been 
unable to find a successor party officials said today 
liberal democratic party officials also said takeshita accepted 
a request from party executives to help in the search which has 
been stalled since the most likely candidate rejected the post 
although he originally was scheduled to step down at the end of 
this month takeshita has agreed to remain in office until the 
party selects a new prime minister 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said takeshita 
will meet party secretarygeneral shintaro abe on saturday to

emerged to replace takeshita 
the liberal democrats search for a new leader suffered a major 
setback may 13 when masayoshi ito a reformminded party veteran 
refused to take the job he cited his age of 75 failing health and 
a disagreement with party leaders over political reform measures 
a new leader is needed to clean up the partys scandaltainted 
image and salvage its plunging popularity before an election for 
half the seats in parliaments upper house expected in june 
the party is facing the worst crisis in its 34year history 
because of a corruption and influencepeddling scandal named after 
recruit co an information and publishing congolemerate accused of 
selling politicians shares at low prices in exchange for favors 
the scandal forced takeshitas resignation and led to indictment 
of a former cabinet minister and senior bureaucrats it also has 
damaged the political futures of dozens of senior politicians 
including former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
news reports speculate that two of the most likely prospects to 
replace takeshita are former prime minister takeo fukuda 84 and 
former lower house speaker michita sakata 72

cholesterol tests in adults as young as 20 can be 
used to predict who is apt to have dangerously high cholesterol 
later in life federal researchers said 
such tests could enable people to change their diet or begin 
exercise programs before serum cholesterol levels get too high 
said a study issued thursday by the atlantabased centers for 
disease control 
high cholesterol is a major factor in heart disease 
the researchers studied statistics on how cholesterol levels 
change over time and developed a formula for predicting what 
cholesterol level a person with a given reading at a given age 
would have years later assuming they make no changes in their 
lifestyle the data can be used to predict the serum cholesterol 
levels of adults age 20 to 57 the study found 
for example a 30yearold woman with a cholesterol level of 155 
can expect a level of 188 by age 50 and the borderline high level 
of 200 at age 56 if no exercise or diet improvements are made 
a count of above 240 is considered high 
researchers found that a mans cholesterol count increases by 
about two points a year from ages 20 to 30 and one point a year 
from age 30 to 60 or an increase of 50 points over the 40 years 
the report said 
a womans cholesterol level on the other hand normally 
increases by about 1 points a year from age 20 to 40 and two 
points a year from age 40 to 60 or 70 points over the 40year span

president bush began a fournation european trip 
today declaring the united states wants a stronger and more 
united europe as he headed to a nato summit where an armscontrol 
dispute threatens allied unity 
with the north atlantic treaty organization embroiled in a major 
dispute about nuclear weapons policy the washington times reported 
that bush planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a 
reduction of up to 10 percent in us troop strength in europe 
as many as 34000 troops 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters aboard air 
force one en route to rome any ideas in this area would be one 
the president would want to discuss with the allies he would raise 
with his partners at this session before he discusses anything 
publicly i am not confirming or denying any decisions 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sen sam 
nunn dga told cbs news in washington that a 10 percent 
reduction is the probable amount of reduction that would occur if 
the soviet union accepted the nato proposal on conventional arms 
control which is now tabled 
a senior nato official asked by reporters in brussels about the 
report said our delegations here on the spot have not been 
apprised of this he spoke on condition of anonymity 
west german government spokesman herbert schmuelling said in 
bonn we have no official word of such a decision some 250000 
us troops are stationed in west germany 
in his departure remarks bush provided no hint of a significant 
american counter to recent soviet arms proposals he said the 
importance of the alliance and its democratic underpinnings is the 
message i now take to europe 
bush upon arriving at the first stop of his trip in rome noted 
that since ancient times the saying goes all roads lead to 
rome and its still true it is fitting that here i begin my 
first trip to europe as president of the united states 
bush praised usitaly ties of friendship and said the united 
states welcomes a stronger and more united europe he said he 
plans to be actively engaged in eastern europe promoting 
measures to encourage political and economic liberlization in 
poland 
in his departure remarks at andrews air force base outside 
washington the president said nato has been a success by any 
measure but success breeds its own challenges today dramatic 
changes are taking place in europe east and west for us those 
changes bring new challenges and unparalleled opportunities 
bush expressed hopes to see a europe that is truly free 
united and at peace and repeated his desire to move beyond the 
cold war policy of containment to integrate the soviet union into 
the community of nations 
bush added we welcome the political and economic 
liberalization that has taken place so far in the soviet union and 
in some countries of eastern europe we watch hoping that more 
changes will follow 
in rome the president planned a twonight stay and talks with 
pope john paul ii as well as with italian leaders 
manfred woerner who is natos chief executive said failure to 
settle a dispute over nuclear weapons would be a rather 
unfortunate situation but it would not be a crisis or a 
catastrophe 
amid growing doubts in washington that a settlement was near 
woerner said in brussels he would like the allies to reach an 
agreement and avoid the impression of being split in an important 
matter 
setting the stage for the nato meeting bush will deliver a 
speech sunday at an american cemetery in nettuno on italys 
seacoast 39 miles south of the capital later sunday the president 
will arrive in brussels where leaders of the 16nation alliance 
will begin two days of formal talks on monday from brussels bush 
will go to west germany and britain 
the summit called to mark natos 40th anniversary and its 
success in keeping the peace in europe was thrown off track in 
advance by a dispute over shortrange nuclear missiles in central 
europe 
the chief players in the argument are west germany which is 
demanding eastwest negotiations soon to curb the missiles and the 
united states and britain which oppose such talks as long as the 
soviet union maintains a major advantage in ground troops tanks 
and other conventional weapons 
the missiles with a range of less than 300 miles are largely 
deployed in west germany and would be used there in the case of war 
the bonnwashington dispute is aggravated by a tide of 
disarmament sentiment in west germany fanned by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs promises to reduce conventional and nuclear 
forces 
on the eve of his departure bush received a message from west 
german chancellor helmut kohl the latest in a series of proposals 
and counterproposals however the white house said the two sides 
remained at an impasse 
our attitude from the beginning has been that we would like to 
reach an agreement on this before the summit but if not well 
discuss it there said bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
if its not resolved there well discuss it in followon 
consultations 
emphasizing that the dispute will not shake the foundations of 
nato fitzwater said we dont believe it will overwhelm or 
dominate the summit and it should not and will not be allowed to 
in brussels woerner said this alliance has lived with 
differences of opinion all through its very successful lifetime 
and if this question is not solved today it will be solved 
tomorrow 
the west german government also is resisting a joint 
usbritish effort to more than triple the range of lance missiles 
to just below 300 miles however a decision on modernizing the 
weapons has been put off until 1992 
bushs trip his first to europe as president is seen as an 
important step as he tries to establish himself as a world 
statesman and attempts to counter gorbachevs success in projecting 
himself as a peacemaker 
its nothing new that a new president faces a test from 
moscow said burton pines senior vice president and director of 
research at the heritage foundation the first test of bush is 
not coming from moscow its bonn which is testing the new 
president

maverick boris n yeltsin and several prominent 
reformers in the new congress were nominated today for a smaller 
fulltime legislature but some charged that senior officials 
rigged the nominee list to stay in power 
lithuania threatened to boycott the elections to the new 
legislature if delegates from other republics are allowed to vote 
on the lithuanian slate 
the lithuanians and other baltic reformers want to protect their 
small reform slates from being lost in an allcongress vote 
president mikhail s gorbachev called the boycott threat a crisis 
situation 
the moves came during the second day of debate in the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies the first competitively 
elected national assembly and the latest step in the soviet 
experiment with democratic reform 
only one member of the ruling communist party politburo appeared 
on a congressional list of nominees for the smaller lawmaking 
body the supreme soviet assuring an overhaul of its traditional 
makeup 
procedural bickering today mirrored the disputes that slowed the 
first day of activity in the congress which was elected this 
spring in the first nationwide multicandidate balloting in 70 years 
a list of 573 members of congress selected by their home regions 
was prepared for 542 seats in the supreme soviet giving deputies 
few choices but setting up tough races for lawmakers from moscow 
home to many of the reformers 
the party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the 
supreme soviet according to the old system complained deputy 
vladimir shevlyuga of rostov 
vladimir zolotukhin of tashkent said top party and government 
officials in uzbekistan had themselves nominated without consulting 
other deputies from the republic 
reformers lost an attempt to force top party officials to choose 
between their party jobs and serving in the supreme soviet as a 
way of easing the grip of the party bureaucracy on the countrys 
legislature 
the congress adopted a measure calling for supreme soviet 
members as a rule to be freed from other jobs to concentrate on 
lawmaking far short of the outright ban sought by delegates 
meanwhile the lithuanian delegation announced through deputy 
vytautas landsbergis it would boycott planned elections to the 
supreme soviet if deputies from other republics are allowed to vote 
on the lithuanian slate 
the congress is trying to decide whether only republics and 
specific regions should be allowed to select their members in the 
supreme soviet or whether lists of candidates from each area 
should be presented to the entire congress to be narrowed down 
the lithuanians who have been pressing for more autonomy from 
moscow are seeking to have their slate elected intact to the 
congress without delegates from other regions tampering with it 
the boycott threat drew criticism from moscow delegates causing 
a rift between two leading groups of reformers 
roy medvedev a moscow historian appealed to the lithuanians to 
reconsider i ask the comrades from lithuania not to break 
the huge amount of work done in our society to democratize it he 
said 
moscow deputies who are generally better known nationally 
insisted on presenting a slate of 55 candidates for the 29 seats 
allocated to them to underline the principle of contested elections 
on thursday the congress elected gorbachev to a fiveyear term 
gorbachev ran unopposed 
he was first elected president by the supreme soviet on oct 1 
1988 replacing andrei gromyko in what was then a largely a 
ceremonial post 
yeltsin refused to run against gorbachev but kept alive the 
possibility he would run for vice president he told reporters he 
did not intend to withdraw from any more races 
some members of the congress plunged into debate over procedural 
issues while many others appeared bored by the slow pace of the 
televised session 
fedor burlatsky a political commentator and head of the 
governments human rights commission said the congress was trying 
to work out not only differences of opinion but differing 
interests of different nationalities and different layers of 
society 
gorbachev rejected calls to place microphones throughout the 
huge hall to permit speakers to have the floor without walking to 
the well in the center of the auditorium lets not turn this 
into a bazaar he said 
while yeltsins name appeared on the list of candidates for the 
supreme soviet his election was not assured 
he was among 12 deputies nominated by a caucus of the russian 
federation the countrys largest constituent republic for their 
11 seats it was also possible nominations would come from the 
floor 
yeltsin once a rising star among gorbachevs key aides was 
fired for criticizing the slow pace of reform then staged a 
dramatic comeback by winning a landslide victory to the congress 
among the moscow nominees were some of the nations bestknown 
progressives including medvedev economist gavril popov and 
agriculture reform advocate yuri chernichenko 
vitaly i vorotnikov chairman of the russian federations 
council of ministers was the only member of the communist partys 
ruling politburo on the list indicating the supreme soviet will be 
led by a new group of leaders 
in the past the body paralleled the leadership of the communist 
party making it a virtual rubberstamp for the kremlin leadership

zhao ziyang the man who represents chinas new 
progressive leadership apparently has been purged by an old guard 
intent on retaining its lock on power and crushing a student 
movement for democracy 
several sources said today that zhao 69 had lost his post as 
general secretary of the 47 millionmember communist party that 
position had made him the most powerful man in china after senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
the sources said zhao has lost a power struggle with the more 
conservative premier li peng they said he was under house arrest 
today and that the party had accused him of fueling student unrest 
with a conciliatory stance 
although deng is zhaos mentor in economic reforms the two 
differ sharply on political reform and zhaos sympathy for the 
students apparently was unacceptable 
if zhaos fall is permanent he would be the second general 
secretary in two years to fall from dengs good graces and be 
sacked for being too sympathetic to prodemocracy student 
demonstrators 
in january 1987 hu yaobang was forced to resign as general 
secretary after being accused of being soft on students seeking a 
freer china it was hus death on april 15 that sparked the far 
larger student movement of today 
zhao ended a sevenyear term as premier when he was named head 
of the party in november 1987 at the same time he was appointed 
first vice chairman of the central military commission deng is 
chairman giving him the needed authority with the military to 
cement his claim as dengs successor 
but zhao became the target of criticism in mid1988 when the 
government hit by an inflation rate of more than 30 percent and 
panic buying began worrying that it had lost control of the 
economy 
conservatives such as premier li blamed the rapid pace of 
marketoriented reforms associated with zhao and imposed a 
twoyear austerity program and freeze on new reforms 
zhaos position became more tenuous this spring with the renewed 
student unrest 
while tens of thousands of students occupied tiananmen square 
earlier this month zhao told soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
that political and economic reform should proceed at an equal pace 
and that chinese should enjoy genuine democracy under the 
communist party 
he later expressed sympathy for the student demands for 
democratic reforms and advocated negotiations with the protesters 
to end the crisis 
deng has permitted only token political liberalization and he 
reportedly gave the orders for declaring martial law in beijing 
zhao has been a role model for the newstyle chinese leader 
suave and articulate he is at ease with the leaders of the 
socialist and western worlds he wears immaculately tailored 
western suits and regularly plays golf a sport once condemned in 
china as a bourgeois luxury 
zhao was born in october 1919 to a landowning family in central 
chinas henan province he joined the communist party in 1938 and 
headed the party committee in his native county for most of the 
193745 chinajapan war 
unlike the previous generation of party leaders he did not take 
part in the 193435 long march the 7700mile trek to the 
northwest to escape the nationalist government troops in eastern 
china 
after the communist victory in 1949 zhao spent most of his 
career in regional government and party posts he was purged during 
the 196676 farleftist cultural revolution as was deng but was 
rehabilitated as early as 1971 
he gained national prominence as party secretary and governor of 
dengs home province sichuan where he carried out dengs policies 
of dismantling communes and allowing private plots and bonuses for 
extra work 
zhao was named party secretary in october at a conference in 
which his keynote speech emphasized increasing production over 
ideological issues he also announced dengs theory that china was 
in a primary stage of socialism during which time private 
ownership of businesses was permissible

two ultralight planes landed in front of the 
reichstag building in west berlin early today and two men 
reportedly claimed they flew a friend to freedom in a daring escape 
from east germany 
police said they were mystified by the landings and had no 
independent confirmation of the reported escape 
the planes were abandoned after landing in front of the 
reichstag building next to the berlin wall at about 5 am 
police said the pilots were not seen and police later towed the 
aircraft away 
police first said they doubted the planes were used for an 
escape but later said they were not ruling out such a possibility 
an anonymous caller telephoned several radio stations to claim 
he flew his relatives out of east germany to west berlin 
rainer hildebrandt head of a private organizaton that monitors 
escapes from east germany said two men came to his office and 
claimed they were the pilots he said the two men told him they 
flew into east germany picked up a friend and flew back to west 
berlin 
hildebrandt said he could not confirm the claim it was not 
immediately clear why the men would have needed to planes to pick 
up their friend 
the men told hildebrandt they had recorded the flight on film 
and wanted to sell it hildebrandt said they refused to appear 
before reporters hildebrandt said in a telephone interview 
he said the men were between 30 and 40 years of age but did not 
identify themselves they said they were former east german 
citizens who have been living in the west he said 
hildebrandt heads working group august 13 a private 
organization that monitors escapes and human rights in east germany 
witnesses reported the propellerdriven aircraft flew parallel 
to the berlin at an alititude of about 165 feet police said 
police said the olivegreen planes were marked with red stars 
pasted onto the wings with yellow tape this could have been a ruse 
designed to fool east german border guards police said 
police said the abandoned ultralights appeared to be the same as 
two aircraft transported to west berlin from west germany four 
weeks ago 
the planes were transported in parts and authorities had given 
permission for the aircraft to be assembled but not flown police

a court today upheld the governments ban on 
broadcast interviews with members of extremist groups in northern 
ireland lawyers for journalists said they may appeal 
six broadcast journalists said the ban on interviews with groups 
such as the irish republican army and the ulster freedom fighters 
was unlawful an unjustifiable interference with freedom of 
expression and a violation of the european convention on human 
rights 
but three high court judges ruled that home secretary douglas 
hurd acted reasonably and lawfully and with the majority approval 
of parliament in imposing the ban in october 
hurds order prohibits the british broadcasting corp and the 
independent broadcasting authority which oversees commercial tv 
from broadcasting words spoken by northern ireland extremists the 
extremists actions objectives and views can be reported 
the rule applies to the ira and its legal political wing sinn 
fein which are fighting to end british rule in northern ireland 
as well as the ulster freedom fighters an outlawed protestant 
extremist group that wants the province to remain british 
lord justice tasker watkins announcing the decision said the 
ban did not prevent either the bbc or commercial television from 
reporting events in northern ireland with due impartiality 
he said the reasonableness of hurds ban was reflected in the 
parliamentary debates in which many lawmakers said the restrictions 
were justified by the need to fight terrorism in northern ireland 
jacob ecclestone deputy general secretary of the national union 
of journalists said an appeal was likely all the way to the house 
of lords britains highest court 
broadcaster scarlett mccgwire one of the plaintiffs called the 
ruling a blow to the british public 
the case is not just about journalists not being able to 
report northern ireland properly it is about people not being able 
to understand what is happening there because it is not reported 
properly she said 
the plaintiffs claimed the restrictions were unjustified 
especially since the amount of broadcasting time given in the past 
to interviews with members of proscribed organizations had been 
trifling and had not shown those interviewed in a good light 
watkins said the question for the court was not whether hurds 
decision was politically wise or unwise but simply whether it was 
lawful

battle lines have been drawn in the perjury trial 
of former rep pat swindall with prosecutors saying he negotiated 
to borrow drug money and lied about it and swindalls lawyers 
saying he was duped 
swindall is accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his 
dealings with an internal revenue service undercover agent mike 
mullaney and a swindall associate charles lechasney later 
convicted of money laundering 
prosecutors say swindall negotiated to use lechasney as a 
middleman in an attempt to borrow 850000 for construction of his 
luxury home from a money broker representing drug interests 
actually the undercover agent 
mullaney the first witness for the prosecution testified today 
that at his first meeting with swindall in august 1987 the 
congressman brought up the possibility of having lechasney 
create some sort of corporation and he would basically get 
his money from charles lechasneys company 
prosecutors played a videotape for the jury of that meeting but 
jurors complained they couldnt hear the soundtrack properly a 
recess was called while court officials worked on the problem 
on thursday when he began his testimony mullaney had said that 
lechasney told him that swindall didnt care where the money came 
from 
he said he also was interested in meeting swindall to 
investigate whether swindalls plans to sell a 1 million note at a 
discount for cash would lead to an evasion of his income taxes 
and violations of currency laws 
in opening statements thursday swindalls attorney richard 
hendrix told the jury that swindall and the government were duped 
by charles lechasney the master manipulator 
hendrix described lechasney as a man with a severe mental 
disorder a sociopath and said lechasney repeatedly fooled 
swindall into thinking the money was legitimate and fooled the 
government into thinking that swindall was a taxevading crook 
hendrix told the jury that swindall never agreed to the deal and 
that he continued to shop for and ultimately got other financing 
for his home 
after swindall did his best to recall for the grand jury in 
february 1988 events of five months earlier hendrix said the 
former congressman was indicted anyway by a government 
predisposed to believe hes a crook 
swindall was indicted oct 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal 
grand jury each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five 
years in prison 
the twoterm republican congressman lost his 4th district seat 
in atlantas eastern suburbs to democrat ben jones a onetime actor 
in televisions dukes of hazzard in november the campaign was 
one of the most bitter house races in the country and one of only a 
handful that ended up in the defeat of an incumbent congressman 
briefs unsealed thursday showed prosecutors have sought to 
introduce tapes of lechasney telling the undercover agent that 
swindall didnt want to know details about the money scheme because 
the congressman said he wanted to be sure he could pass a 
liedetector test if necessary 
the prosecutors said the tapes would show swindall planned to 
lie to the grand jury 
but defense attorneys contended that if the tapes were admitted 
as evidence they should be allowed to submit evidence that 
swindall passed a lie detector test in which he was asked if he had 
lied to the grand jury such evidence previously has been ruled 
inadmissible in most cases

a third of the children in vietnams 
southern commercial center ho chi minh city cant afford to go to 
school the vietnam news agency reported friday 
city resources are being severely strained by an alarming 
population explosion of 70000 more mouths to feed each year the 
official agency said 
every year about 150000 adults reaching the working age 
cannot find a job this does not include 29000 people who stay at 
home as housewives it said thirtyseven percent of the 
children at school age cannot afford schooling and this is one of 
the many reasons for the rise in the crime rate 
the city of 5 million people hoped to lower the annual 
population growth rate to one percent by 1990 the report said 
this is no easy target because the feudalist tendency to view 
happiness as synonymous with having many children still prevails 
among large sections especially peasants it said 
under the citys family planning program couples who have no 
more than two children get preferential treatment in housing 
wages and tourist trips the report said

the apparent demise of communist party chief zhao 
ziyang has proven again that heirs to power in china often end up 
on the fast track to oblivion 
as head of the 47 millionmember ruling party zhao was in line 
to succeed deng xiaoping as chinas untitled but undisputed leader 
many had predicted that deng 84 would retire by the end of the 
year 
sources now say zhao has been stripped of his post after 
crossing with deng over the handling of the prodemocracy student 
uprising zhao was sympathetic with its goals and sought 
compromise deng demanded a crackdown and declared martial law in 
beijing 
zhao is hardly the first to be raised up only to be slapped 
down by an autocratic ruler 
the most recent was zhaos predecessor hu yaobang who was 
forced to resign in similar circumstances in january 1987 
hu also was dengs unofficially designated successor until 
student demonstrations in december 1986 kindled a battle between 
party hardliners and moderates deng an economic reformer with 
conservative views on political reform moved to stamp out 
bourgeois liberalization or favoring western ideas 
hu was ousted for being too soft on the students and it was his 
death april 15 that triggered the recent bigger unrest 
the most tragic case of a deposed no 2 was that of liu shaoqi 
one of mao tsetungs earliest supporters by the 1950s he was 
maos secondincommand and in 1959 became head of state 
but mao turned on liu during the 196676 cultural revolution 
branding him a traitor liu and his wife were personally humiliated 
in red guard struggles and he is believed to have died in prison 
in 1969 
lius downfall in the cultural revolution was paralleled by the 
rise of defense minister lin biao a party congress in 1969 
formally named lin vice chairman and designated him as maos 
successor 
but lin plotted to assassinate mao in 1971 so he could seize 
power before rivals could mount a challenge to his position 
according to official accounts his conspiracy was uncovered and he 
was killed in a plane crash while trying to flee to the soviet 
union 
maos next designated heir hua guofeng did make it to the top 
but his stay was shortlived in 1976 backed by maos reported 
deathbed comment with you in charge im at ease hua arrested 
the leftist gang of four led by maos wife and assumed 
leadership of the party and government 
but hua who spent most of his career in the provinces was no 
match for deng who was purged during the cultural revolution but 
came back after the decade of chaos to steadily gain supporters for 
his new pragmatic policies 
by 1978 deng was in charge and hua was heading to the 
sidelines today he is a littleseen and muchignored party cadre

a lowpower atomic testing license was 
approved today for the seabrook nuclear power plant which has been 
a focus of the antinuclear movement since the project was 
conceived two decades ago 
the people here feel its really about time an elated 
edward brown president of seabrook operator new hampshire yankee 
told reporters thursday after a favorable court ruling in 
washington late in the day 
that court action cleared the way for the nuclear regulatory 
commission to formally issue the lowpower license nrc spokesman 
frank ingram said the commission staff granted the license shortly 
after 9 am today 
the commission approved the move a week ago but delayed the 
paperwork to allow for appeals 
signs were posted in the seabrook administration building 
celebrating the decision one read license received a time for 
pride a time for power 
although the plant has been the site of numerous protests over 
the years there were no demonstrators outside the facility this 
morning 
seabrooks first chain reaction could start within two weeks 
plant officials said today they expected to start preparations for 
the tests this weekend 
a lowpower license allows a reactor to operate at 5 percent 
capacity 
most of the plants 1400 workers had already gone home by the 
time the court ruled seabrook spokesman ron sher said but for 
those people seen here there were certainly a lot of smiles and 
congratulations 
theres certainly a sense of relief and also a sense of 
satisfaction that all of the work that weve done for so long to 
get us to this point will allow us to do what weve been ready to 
do and that is prepare the plant for the generation of 
electricity sher said 
ten years behind schedule and 10 times over budget the 6 
billion plant has been a focus of the nations antinuclear 
movement 
located on marshland less than two miles from the states most 
popular beach near interstate 95 and only 40 miles from boston 
seabrook was the target of mass protests including one that 
resulted in 1414 arrests in 1977 
sixteen months ago lead plant owner public service co of new 
hampshire was forced by its seabrook debt to seek bankruptcy 
reorganization 
finished nearly three years ago seabrook has remained idle 
principally because of massachusetts gov michael dukakis refusal 
to cooperate in emergency planning based on a study triggered by 
the soviet nuclear disaster at chernobyl in april 1986 dukakis 
declared that safe evacuation of people around seabrook could not 
be assured 
the nrc since has accepted pending a detailed study in 
progress emergency plans submitted by seabrooks owners 12 
utilities serving much of new england 
seabrook foes promise to continue fighting and insist that that 
their chances are better when the issue becomes commercial 
operation 
were not out of this by a long shot said massachusetts 
attorney general james shannon probably the key player in the 
antiseabrook fight 
seabrooks brown insisted that safety concerns will not prevent 
commercial operation i said it before and ill say it again 
today seabrook station is the safest power plant thats ever been 
built he said 
brown spoke at a news conference less than an hour after the 
us circuit court of appeals in washington turned down a 
lastditch appeal by shannon and others to block the tests 
they argued that tests should not start until all health and 
safety issues including evacuation planning are resolved 
but the onepage order from the threejudge appeals panel said 
petitions have failed to demonstrate the requisite irreparable 
injury and likelihood of success on the merits to warrant the 
preliminary relief sought 
plant officials said the license would be picked up by employees 
at seabrooks licensing office which is near nrc headquarters 
plant spokesman rob williams said thursday that the license and 
accompanying books of technical specifications would be flown to 
seabrook 
seabrook officials said testing should begin within 10 days 
the nrc approved the lowpower license after seabrook officials 
set up a 721 million fund to cover the estimated added costs of 
mothballing the plant if it undergoes lowpower testing but never 
operates commercially

health and human services secretary louis w 
sullivan told medical school graduates friday they face a period 
of great stress and great tension in medicine 
he said this country ranks first in the world in per capita 
expenditures for health care with those costs currently consuming 
almost 12 percent of us gross national product and continuing to 
rise at an unsustainable rate 
yet the united states lags far behind other industrialized 
countries in some basic indicators of health status life 
expectancy maternal mortality and an infant mortality rate of 104 
deaths per 1000 live births which ranks us 19th in the world 
sullivan said 
sullivan himself a physician and former medical dean at 
morehouse college in atlanta spoke at commencement ceremonies for 
the george washington university school of medicine and health 
sciences 
he said certain segments of our population lag unconscionably 
in health status and in access to health care namely blacks 
hispanics native americans rural people and innercity residents 
in fact parts of cities and some counties in our country have 
health indices no better than those of third world countries he 
said 
sullivan urged the medical school graduates to become 21st 
century renaissance health professionals who are not only 
technically competent but sensitive to a broad range of issues 
involving health care across the united states and around the globe

machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades across beiruts 
sectarian dividing line for two hours police said no casualties 
were reported 
an arab league summit in morocco agreed to call for syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon then dropped the demand syria has 40000 
soldiers in the country under a peacekeeping mandate granted by the 
league in 1976 when the lebanese civil war was a year old 
an explosion was reported in the densely populated abu samra 
neighborhood of tripoli a syriancontrolled port about 35 miles 
north of beirut the lebanese red cross said the cause was not 
known immediately 
it started a fire but no details are available because 
telephone contacts with tripoli are down a red cross spokesman 
said 
the us embassy denied a report by the daily alanwar 
published in christian east beirut that aouns christian cabinet 
had expelled charge daffaires daniel simpson for policies 
hostile to lebanon 
an embassy spokesman who would not let his name be used said 
simpson was asked by the american government to go back to 
washington as a routine measure he left yesterday 
alanwar said simpson was told to leave lebanon in 48 hours 
because the constitutional lebanese government considers him 
persona non grata due to his hostile stands and practices 
christian newspapers have accused simpson of supporting syrias 
role in lebanon 
in addition to comanding the 20000 christians of lebanons 
army aoun also leads one of the two rival governments that 
resulted from a political crisis last september premier salim hoss 
heads the moslem cabinet 
artillery duels with druse militiamen soon joined by the 
syrians began march 8 two days after aouns forces blockaded 
illegal ports operated by moslem militias 
as the intensity increased aoun declared the fight a war of 
liberation against the syrians and said his goal was to drive them 
from the country more than 350 people have been killed and nearly 
1400 wounded nearly all of them civilians 
israel radio said the prime minister yitzhak shamirs cabinet 
met to discuss reports that syria had sent an armored armored 
brigade and helicopterborne commandos into lebanon 
in damascus the official syria times said syrian army 
artillery and air force units conducted mock attacks on ground 
troops but did not say where the exercise took place 
syrian television quoted the defense minister gen mustafa 
tlass as saying without elaboration the maneuver on a 
fullstage battle against the enemy was successful 
a reliable source in damascus speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he was almost certain the maneuvers did not 
take place in lebanon 
both the christians and syrians have stockpiled weapons and 
ammunition in the relative calm of a partially successful 
ceasefire the arab league called two weeks ago 
reports have circulated in lebanon that the syrians plan an 
assault on the 310squaremile enclave east of beirut where about 1 
million christians live 
on thursday the markaziyeh newsletter published in the 
christian sector said 40 syrian tanks and armored personnel 
carriers had entered lebanon and taken positions in mountains south 
and east of beirut that overlook the christian enclave 
a spokesman for aouns christian army units said two israeli 
warplanes broke the sound barrier at 35000 feet over the chouf 
mountains southeast of beirut at noon friday

major industrialized nations were holding a summit meeting in 
venice 
first a car bomb exploded on via boncompagni along the side of 
the us embassy compound damaging other parked cars and blowing 
out two large windows in the nearby hotel excelsior except for an 
italian woman passerby who suffered from shock there were no 
injuries 
less than an hour later two homemade rockets were fired over 
the gates of the us embassy causing minor damage but no 
injuries a similar rocket landed harmlessly in an ornamental pool 
at the british embassy about a halfmile away 
the rockets aimed at the us embassy were launched from the 
balcony of a fifthfloor room of the hotel ambasciatori 
the terrorists were never caught but italian authorities pieced 
together descriptions of suspects and issued arrest warrants for 
members of the japanese red army a lebanesebased group sponsored 
by libya 
the same group was blamed for the car bomb attack on a us 
servicemens club in naples in april 1988 that killed five people 
including an american woman 
security was also stepped up friday at airports and train 
stations authorities said police helicopters and restricted air 
routes would be used for bushs trips by helicopter 
police said the strict security measures were taken as a 
precaution not because they had received any threats or 
indications of terrorist activity 
despite the tight security advertisements were published in 
rome newspapers friday inviting the public to the memorial day 
ceremony bush is scheduled to attend sunday at the american world 
war ii cemetery in nettuno about 45 miles south of rome

a grand jury refused to indict a young 
mother for manslaughter in her infants death which was linked to 
alleged cocaine use during pregnancy authorities said today 
prosecutors had charged melanie green 24 with involuntary 
manslaughter and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor a 
charge usually used against streetcorner drug dealers 
a winnebago county grand jury that met thursday did not indict 
her on any charge states attorney paul logli said 
ms greens 2dayold baby bianca died feb 4 cocaine was 
found in biancas system and in her mothers said dr p john 
seward the county coroner the drug was carried through the 
placenta to the fetus reducing biancas ability to accept oxygen 
from the mother and resulting in brain damage 
logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled 
substance 
ms green had accepted an offer of free representation from the 
american civil liberties union in the case 
in a similar case another mother in this northern illinois city 
of 140000 was convicted may 1 of prenatal child abuse for using 
cocaine throughout her pregnancy including the hours right before 
she gave birth that child survived 
on thursday the mother whose name was not released because she 
is a juvenile regained custody of her 6monthold daughter but 
judge frederick j kapala made the custody arrangement temporary 
pending a hearing july 6 in which the woman must demonstrate that 
she can give the baby a good home 
if the mother is making progress and shows she is providing a 
nurturing environment for the child the state is considering 
placing full guardianship with the mother assistant states 
attorney gary golian said 
the child was placed in a foster home after kapala found the 
woman guilty may 1 of prenatal abuse 
at the time the judge said he was forced to take a stand on 
the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed the woman had used 
cocaine up to a few hours before birth 
the woman has completed a drug rehabilitation program said her 
attorney alberto f altamore

conservatives who gained control of the communist 
party leadership in a bitter power struggle activated timetested 
education mechanisms friday for ensuring control at the grassroots 
as well 
the television news said party members and soldiers attended 
lengthy meetings to study may 19 speeches in which premier li peng 
and president yang shangkun announced troops would restore 
order after more than a month of studentled protests for 
democracy 
political study sessions have been an important element of the 
partys grassroots control during 40 years of rule once top 
leaders set a new party line meetings routinely are called at 
every level to study it from the central committee down to the 
local cell 
party members then are expected to take the lead in educating 
nonmembers at study sessions in workplaces and mass organizations 
in the current power struggle the meetings will be especially 
important because so many party members security forces and 
beijing residents took part in the demonstrations now being 
denounced 
army cadets soldiers of the logistics department police the 
communist partys youth league and employees of government 
ministries were among the marchers 
the party never satisfied with simply issuing an order from 
above will be trying to win over as many people as possible and 
frighten the rest into silent cooperation party members who 
shouted down with li peng in the anonymity of a crowd of 
hundreds of thousands will be unlikely to dare speak out in a small 
study session of their peers 
chinese sources said the main texts being studied friday were 
the speeches li and yang made on national tv just before declaring 
martial law in parts of the capital an internal report on the 
protests by beijings party chief and speeches made thursday by 
yang and former president li xiannian at a politburo meeting that 
voted to back the hardliners 
party members praised the li and yang speeches as very 
important and said they represented the will of the entire 
party the nationally televised evening news said 
the television also showed troops who have been ordered to 
impose martial law taking part in study sessions the troops have 
been quartered on the outskirts of beijing since last weekend when 
hundreds of thousands of citizens blocked their way into the 
capital 
the daretodie units of citizens who blockaded the troop 
trucks administered their own kind of propaganda lecturing the 
soldiers for hours on end about the student protesters goals of 
increasing democracy and wiping out corruption they gave the 
soldiers food water and cigarettes and urged them not to hurt the 
students 
in an apparent effort to counteract the peoples propaganda 
army officers lectured the troops friday on their martial law 
mission 
the television showed soldiers sitting in small groups in their 
tents their bedrolls neatly stashed behind them studying a harsh 
letter from the top army command that claimed a small group of 
people were using the students to attack the party leadership 
education has yet to begin in earnest in ordinary workplaces 
where most efforts so far have been directed at keeping employees 
from joining demonstrations some employers have threatened 
dismissal or fines for anyone who marches others have tried to 
bribe workers with free food and drink to stay in 
some large workplaces also formed worker militias ostensibly to 
help keep order on the streets but in reality to keep workers 
occupied at night

isaac said as tourists gawked from the deck of the intrepid an

isaac who described himself as an outofwork carpenter 
plumber and electrician said he once shared a girlfriends 
condominium when that fizzled out he moved onto the highway in 
november his friends joined him last winter 
im not homeless he says emphatically people who are 
homeless are living on the subway they dont change their 
clothes 
it took isaac a day to build his hut after scavenging a piece 
here a piece there nails wire tape the address he says 
with a grin is bridge apartment 221 
he sometimes visits his sisters home once he caught himself 
walking hunched over conditioning from his own 4foothigh 
ceiling i straightened up right away if they knew where i 
lived theyd say youre 36 years old and youre embarrassing the 
family are you crazy 
im from ohio if my mother saw me living like this shed

house democratic whip tony coelho despite 
questions about his business dealings will jump in with both 
feet if the majority leaders position becomes vacant setting up 
a likely confrontation with rep ed jenkins dga congressional 
sources said today 
the twoway race for the no 2 leadership post shaped up as 
sources said rep richard gephardt dmo had decided against 
seeking the job 
the jockeying came in expectation that rep jim wright dtexas 
would resign as house speaker next week in the wake of charges that 
he committed 69 rules violations and majority leader thomas foley 
dwash would replace him 
gephardt had been urged by some house democrats to challenge 
coelho whose own personal business dealings have come under 
scrutiny to spare the party further embarrassment should an ethics 
probe ensue 
one source said gephardt was interested in running for coelhos 
current job of majority whip the no 3 spot in the house 
democratic heirarchy 
spokeswoman deborah johns said gephardt was waiting to see 
what the speaker is going to do hes listening to people and at 
this time he just hasnt made a decision 
jenkins will be a candidate for the position when the speaker 
resigns said a source close to the georgia lawmaker who is 
running with support from the powerful chairman of the house ways 
and means committee dan rostenkowski dill 
rostenkowski usually supports the members of his committee and 
only one of them jenkins is in the race right now said a 
source close to the chairman 
none of the house sources would allow their names to be used 
when a vacancy occurs for the position of majority leader i 
fully expect tony coelho to be in with both feet and running to 
win said one source 
asked if gephardt would run against his close friend coelho 
the source said thats not going to happen the source 
indicated the information came from a personal conversation between 
the two congressmen 
coelho spokesman david dreyer would not reveal the californians 
future plans 
early in 1988 coelho organized a campaign trip for several 
dozen colleagues and lobbyists who flew to iowa to boost the 
presidential campaign of gephardt the two have remained close 
a group of gephardts supporters on thursday urged him to run 
viewing the missouri democrat as a white hat figure who could 
help his party recover from the ethical problems that appear to 
have ruined wrights career 
some house democrats worried that ethics questions recently 
raised about coelhos financial dealings could make him a political 
liability if the californian succeeded foley as majority leader 
but coelho also is remembered fondly by many democrats from his 
days as the democratic congressional campaign chairman who doled 
out the money that got many of the lawmakers elected 
coelho not only organized the campaign trip for gephardt but 
was present for the excandidates most triumphant moment during 
the 1988 democratic primary season when the missouri congressman 
won the iowa precinct caucuses on feb 8 that year 
wright is expected to resign next week just as he faces 
disciplinary proceedings over house ethics committee charges of 69 
rules violations 
that would free foley to move up to speaker and likely trigger 
races for majority leader majority whip and possibly caucus 
chairman 
some house democrats suggested that the party quickly elevate 
foley and allow several weeks to pass before deciding on other 
leadership positions 
rep pat williams dmont said he favors such a course but 
added that the coelho camp wants the incumbents to quickly move up 
the ladder 
coelhos strongest support appeared to come from his own 
california democratic delegation whose chairman rep don edwards 
said we just think tony has been the best whip in the history of 
the house and deserves to be majority leader 
another californian rep george brown dcalif said he backs 
coelho for majority leader but admitted that members will take 
into consideration the public reaction to the situation 
we must make sure nobody who is in a replacement mode has any 
impediments that cause problems said rep dan glickman dkan 
if we have a secondary ethics problem it could be very 
catastrophic for our party in the house were on somewhat shaky 
footing now and need to reestablish our stability 
news stories have detailed and coelho has confirmed that a 
california savings and loan official purchased a 100000 
highyield junk bond for the lawmaker in 1986 after coelho found 
himself unable to finance the purchase himself 
a month later the bank official sold the bond to coelho for the 
initial offering price which saved the lawmaker about 4000 
compared with the market price at the time 
house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts from anyone 
with a direct interest in legislation coelho said he did not 
violate house rules and asked the ethics committee to review the 
transaction 
on thursday the los angeles times reported that the justice 
department is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of 
whether coelho received favors from drexel burnham lambert inc 
the firm that issued the junk bond 
coelho said in a statement i am confident the story is 
inaccurate and i so advised the los angeles times which chose to 
go ahead with the story anyway in washingtons current atmosphere 
such stories based on rumors or leaks are perhaps inevitable but 
no less regrettable 
the associated press reported earlier this week that coelho 
owned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time he 
was pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of some 
dairy farms

israeli officials are keeping a close watch on 
the syrian military buildup in lebanon but said friday they see no 
immediate danger to their northern border 
the cabinet met thursday night about reports that a mechanized 
brigade had joined the 40000 syrian soldiers already in lebanon 
where a syriandruse alliance has been been fighting christian army 
soldiers since early march 
most officials and observers said syrias objective seemed to be 
convincing the arab summit in morocco it would not leave lebanon 
rather than posing a threat to israel 
as long as we dont feel directly threatened there is no way 
israel is going to intervene said foreign ministry spokesman 
alon liel 
col renaan gissin deputy army spokesman said clearly any 
change of forces on the ground is a concern to us we are watching 
to see if this presents any threat to israels northern border or 
the security zone 
that zone is a strip of lebanese territory just north of the 
border varying in depth from six to 10 miles patrolled by israeli 
soldiers and a mainly christian surrogate militia called the south 
lebanon army 
military sources said privately the army had not raised the 
alert status of its border units 
concern about a syrian move southward or an expansion of the 
syrianchristian fight in lebanon was evident however 
any war on our northern border is not good because of the 
potential to spill over a government official said on condition 
of anomyity 
zeev eitan an analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee center 
for strategic studies said israeli reconnaissance flights could be 
hampered if syria moved antiaircraft missiles into new areas of 
lebanon 
ron benishai military correspondent of the independent daily 
yediot ahronot noted that military actions sometimes go beyond the 
planned scope and said on army radio its known that in the 
middle east often without intention things can escalate

section of downtown helsinki he ate he bathed he danced he went 
to the bathroom he did everything inside his diaphanous digs but 
throw stones 
when the 37yearold performance artist finally emerged he was 
greeted with roses pink champagne and applause from some of the 
passersby who had watched a man live life in a fishbowl 
its just another production but i lived it with every 
inch of my soul thank you all for your support said kela 
wearing a dark suit and bow tie 
an estmated 100000 people daily passed by kelas temporary 
home set up on a stage near one of helsinkis busiest public 
squares the structure glassedin on two sides was equipped with 
sleeping bag stereo system telephone two laundry baskets fresh 
flowers and unashamedly a seethrough bathtub 
the weeklong performance titled cityman receiving 19000 
in support from finnish cultural authorities and the helsinki 
students union 
kela made no prior announcement before turning himself into a 
human goldfish on may 19 
he said he was happy about the reactions he got from his 
transparent attempt to merge art and everyday life 
some people turned nasty in the evenings mainly drunks and 
even though i had my own personal guard nearby i found sleeping 
difficult on the first two nights kela told reporters 
most people were positive they laughed and enjoyed 
themselves which is the main thing kela said 
women from kelas dance troupe provided food trays and joined 
him for entertainment in the evenings 
kela danced to music and advertisements from commercial radio 
stations that blared over loudspeakers both inside and outside the 
glass bowl he figured he danced about 10 hours daily 
they were occasionally interrupted with recorded messages by 
kela announcing in english that he is the cityman the best 
everyone wants my body everyone would like to make love to me 
kela said the message of cityman was in the words and in his 
dance when asked if his performance was meant as a kind of social 
protest he said the dance speaks for itself 
kela was recently granted a fiveyear grant from the education 
ministry 
organizers from the student union said there were no problems 
with the police or public 
we only had one complaint and that was for allowing radio 
commercials to be aired in public he said

the death sentence is mandatory for people convicted of murder 
in south africa unless the judge finds mitigating circumstances 
most of those sentenced friday proclaimed their innocence before 
supreme court judge jan basson 
i am an elderly woman and have been found guilty for something 
i have not done said evelina de bruin other people committed 
this crime 
justice bekebeke the only defendant found to have inflicted 
blows in the killing did not maintain his innocence but the 
24yearold told the court the case was based on racial 
prejudice 
lawyer andy durbach said the sentences will be appealed 
the socalled upington 25 were convicted in april 1988 under the 
principle of common purpose which holds a person responsible for 
crowd actions if they were part of the group 
the day of the killing about 3000 blacks gathered on a soccer 
field to protest rent increases 
police dispersed the crowd and most went home peacefully except 
for about 300 who regrouped and attacked sethwala 
prosecutors said the upington 25 were in the crowd that pelted 
sethwalas house with stones sethwala fired a gun out the window 
wounding a small boy defense lawyers said this incited the crowd 
to force the victim from his house assault him and set him ablaze 
the judge said the killing was politically motivated part of a 
conspiracy to attack authorities 
basson rejected arguments that individual defendants cannot be 
held accountable for actions of a crowd one of those convicted was 
described by witnesses as a close friend of the victim 
the principle of common purpose also was used against the 
sharpeville six a group of black men and women convicted of 
slaying a black town councilor after an international campaign 
president pw botha last year commuted their death sentences to 
lengthy prison terms

the judge who sentenced a 
white racist to hang for killing seven blacks and an indian man is 
under police protection for fear of revenge attacks newspapers 
reported friday 
police headquarters refused to confirm or deny reports that 
pretoria supreme court justice louis harms two assistants and two 
prosecutors are under protective surveillance since thursdays 
sentencing of barend strydom 
strydom 23 was convicted of killing seven people and wounding 
15 blacks in a shooting spree in pretoria on nov 15 
there is concern that rightwing political agitators may 
attack the judge and his associates the star newspaper said 
the black taxi driver who disarmed strydom said friday he may 
flee the area because of harassment by white extremists simon 
mkondeleli 33 took refuge in a newspaper office thursday when he 
was chased by several whites after the sentencing 
strydom a former policeman belonged to the afrikaner 
resistance movement which seeks to establish a whitesonly state 
he testified during his trial that he believes blacks are subhuman 
and he wanted his attack to provoke a war of freedom to ensure 
white dominance 
the extreme boerestaat party has described strydom as a 
sensitive afrikaner patriot and is campaigning for his clemency 
in editorials friday progovernment newspapers said strydoms 
fanaticism is not unique 
it was not just one misguided and confused young man said 
beeld the largest afrikaanslanguage daily the offensive 
opinions of a fanatical minority were heard and found guilty 
the fact that strydom is hailed as a hero in these circles 
leaves no doubt as to the viciousness of the rights sickness 
a more liberal newspaper the argus of cape town said the 
governments racist policies are partly to blame for strydoms 
views it described him as a frankenstein monster lurching out 
of a dark and bitter past 
in a separate case the justice department confirmed friday that 
it has reprieved henry burt a white facing execution for murdering 
a black policeman his sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison 
burt was convicted in 1987 of killing sgt jacob ndimande and 
trying to make it appear black radicals had committed the crime by 
using the necklace method numerous suspected government 
collaborators were executed in 198486 by necklacing in which 
a gasolinesoaked tire is placed around a victims neck and set 
alight

yang shangkun an elderly general and chinas 
ceremonial head of state has emerged as a major player in the 
struggle for control of the government 
yang 81 has been a leading spokesman for the hardline policy 
of imposing martial law on beijing and crushing the student 
uprising 
yang on the night of may 19 appeared on national tv with 
premier li peng to announce that troops would be brought in to 
restore order to the capital 
chinese sources said yang also delivered a speech to party and 
government leaders on thursday that strongly condemned communist 
party general secretary zhao ziyang for being sympathetic to the 
student cause 
zhao one of chinas leading reformers has been stripped of his 
post in connection with the recent disturbances sources say 
students occupying tiananmen square have reacted in anger to 
yangs statements demanding that he along with li and deng step 
down 
yang a jovial man who is quick to smile seems out of place in 
the role of the ironfisted disciplinarian 
because of his long association with senior leader deng xiaoping 
and his public statements he has been regarded as a solid 
supporter of economic reforms and chinas opening to the world 
when he became president or head of state in april 1988 he 
spoke of the longing of the people of all our nationalities for a 
dramatic change in the face of the country 
yang as ranking military man in the central military commission 
headed by deng has also worked closely with deng to bring about 
reform in chinas oversized technically backward army 
he helped direct the 198587 effort to reduce the size of the 
peoples liberation army from 42 million to about 32 million 
people and led the campaign to abandon maos concept of a 
revolutionary guerrilla force in favor of a modern wellequipped 
army 
but like deng yang suffered during the turmoil of the 196676 
cultural revolution and apparently shares his aversion to social 
instability when the student movement swelled beyond control yang 
joined deng and the forces of law and order 
yang born in 1907 in dengs home province of sichuan studied 
for four years in the soviet union before returning to join the red 
army in the long march the epic 193435 flight from chiang 
kaisheks pursuing nationalist forces 
always an administrator rather than a military strategist he 
became secretarygeneral of the partys military commission in 
1945 after the communist victory in 1949 he was given the key 
administrative post of director of the general office of the party 
central committee a post he held until the cultural revolution 
began in 1966 
imprisoned during the cultural revolution he returned to become 
deputy governor of guangdong province in southern china in 1978 
and in 1981 rose to permanent vice chairman of the central military 
commission the next year he gained a seat on the party politburo 
as president his main function is to officially welcome 
visiting dignitaries and he has made a quick transition from 
uniform to western suit but the current crisis has also shown the 
personable president to be a hard military man ready to back his 
superior deng when duty calls

czechoslovakia today expelled three british 
diplomats and a businessman in what the foreign office called an 
unjustified retaliation for the recent expulsion of four 
czechoslovaks from britain 
a foreign office spokesman said czechoslovak authorities told 
the british ambassador to prague laurence okeefe the four 
britons must leave in two weeks because of unacceptable 
activities diplomatic jargon for spying 
its clearly an unjustified action said the spokesman 
speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom its clearly 
in retaliation 
he identified the four britons as the embassys first secretary 
of administration tony arnold first secretary counsellor rick 
todd third secretary patricia holland and a manager of shell oil 
nick brooks 
earlier today the czechoslovak communist party daily rude 
pravo called the expulsion of its diplomats another case of 
british spymania which certain british circles bring about from 
time to time 
on may 19 britain expelled eight soviet diplomats and three 
journalists and moscow retaliated in kind a day later 
the soviets then demanded that britain reduce to 205 the number 
of britons and their locally hired support staff in the soviet 
union in order to match the quota of soviets allowed in britain 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons on 
thursday that the expulsions of the soviets and the czechoslovaks 
were vital regardless of the effect upon our relations before 
the expulsions britain had been enjoying its best relations with 
the soviet union since world war ii 
britain also had been improving relations with czechoslovakia 
partly because british authorities want help in detecting the 
czechoslovakmade explosive semtex used by the irish republican 
army and other terrorist groups 
sir john fretwell foreign office politcal director said 
czechoslovakia had ignored warnings to rein in its diplomats in 
september 1988 when three others were expelled

deng xiaoping a pragmatic visionary who reversed 
leftist economic policies that had devastated the economy showed 
himself a rigid hardliner in politics when he led a purge of 
liberals this week 
it was the third time in a decade of rule as chinas senior 
leader that deng responded to calls for democracy with a crackdown 
for the second time the chief victim was a former deng protege in 
this case communist party general secretary zhao ziyang 
sources said friday that zhao was under house arrest after the 
party politburo voted to strip him of his post at least one other 
liberal official also was reported under house arrest while others 
were said to be in trouble 
deng was a hero to many chinese a decade ago when he began his 
second revolution that disbanded mao tsetungs communes and 
allowed private enterprise 
but the many students and supporters who paraded through the 
streets of beijing and other cities the past six weeks made him a 
figure of ridicule 
they likened him to mao as a leader who clung hungrily to power 
long after his mandate was lost 
deng xiaoping your time is up some wrote bluntly on 
posters carried in marches over the past two weeks children 
chanted your mind is not sharp 
but the 84yearold deng who survived two purges under mao 
showed he was still adept in games of power 
it apparently was at his orders that premier li peng declared 
martial law in central beijing on may 20 and his power base in the 
military that decided a subsequent behindthescenes contest 
between him and zhao 
deng stepped down from his main party posts in 1987 but remained 
chairman of the central military commission 
zhao told visiting soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at last 
weeks historic summit that the party decided in 1987 it still 
needed dengs guidance in most important questions 
in the allimportant question of how to handle the widening 
studentled protests it was deng who had the final say 
deng was born on aug 22 1904 the eldest son of a wealthy 
landowner in the southwest province of sichuan his original name 
was kan zegao but he changed it to deng xiaoping little 
peace when he joined the communist party in 1924 while on a 
workstudy program in france 
he later studied at moscow university and returned to china to 
become a guerrilla leader and party officer in the civil war 
against the ruling nationalists 
after the communist victory in 1949 he became vice premier 
under chou enlai but while chou managed to survive the cultural 
revolution purges of alleged capitalist roaders within the 
party deng was a repeated victim 
after criticizing maos forced communization of agriculture and 
proposing material incentives to workers he was purged in 1967 and 
sent to do factory and farm labor 
he was recalled as vice premier in 1973 but ousted again in 1976 
for allegedly causing protests against the radical leaders of the 
cultural revolution nicknamed the gang of four 
his absence was shortlived he returned to office the following 
july by then mao had died and the gang of four including 
maos widow jiang qing had been arrested 
deng consolidated his position as top leader in december 1978 
and immediately began to implement the economic programs that had 
caused his downfall in the 1960s the communes were gradually 
dismantled and workers were given bonuses for extra production 
foreign investors and traders were welcomed and chinas economy 
began a 10year boom that saw skyscrapers rise in main cities 
private factories spring up throughout the countryside and consumer 
fever sweep both rural and urban areas 
but deng was never a liberal in the western sense he referred 
to many of the western cultural influences that invaded chinese 
cities along with western investment as flies that come in an open 
window he did not favor closing the window but recommended 
installing a screen 
in 1979 he cracked down harshly on the democracy wall movement 
during which hundreds of students and workers put up bigcharacter 
posters calling for democracy on a wall in central beijing 
several leading democracy wall activists including wei 
jingsheng remain in prison reportedly in poor physical and mental 
health deng has ignored recent calls by leading chinese 
intellectuals for their release 
in 1987 after a wave of national student protests deng allowed 
party conservatives to force the ouster of relatively liberal party 
general secretary hu yaobang a campaign was started against 
liberal thought in which several famous intellectuals lost their 
jobs or party memberships hu like zhao had been a protege of 
deng 
in the months leading up to the latest student protests more 
and more scholars clamored for political freedoms to match the new 
economic freedoms in his last public statements before being 
ousted zhao affirmed their position 
deng made it clear this wont be possible as long as he is in 
charge

zhao ziyang wanted economic and political reform 
to go handinhand but conservatives were determined to keep their 
power and crush a student movement for democracy 
sources said friday that premier li peng and the old guard won 
and zhao lost his post as head of the 47 millionmember communist 
party which had made him the most powerful man in china after 
senior leader deng xiaoping 
they said zhao 69 was under house arrest accused of 
encouraging student unrest by being conciliatory 
although deng is zhaos mentor in economic reforms the two 
differ on political reform zhaos sympathy for the students 
apparently was unacceptable 
just two years ago deng dismissed another party chief for being 
too sympathetic to prodemocracy students 
hu yaobang was forced to resign in january 1987 after 
accusations that he was soft on students seeking a freer china 
hus death april 15 inspired the current student movement which 
has a far grander scale 
zhao had been premier for seven years when he took over the 
party in november 1987 he also was appointed first vice chairman 
of the central military commission of which deng is chairman 
he became the target of criticism a year ago when the 
government faced with annual inflation of more than more than 30 
percent and panic buying as a result began worrying that it had 
lost control of the economy 
li and other conservatives blamed the rapid pace of 
marketoriented reforms associated with zhao they imposed a 
twoyear austerity program and postponed more reform 
this spring the renewed student unrest made zhaos position 
even more tenuous 
while tens of thousands of students occupied tiananmen square 
earlier this month he told president mikhail s gorbachev of the 
soviet union political and economic reform should proceed together 
and china should enjoy genuine democracy under the communist 
party 
he later expressed sympathy with the students demanding 
democratic reforms and advocated negotiations to end the crisis he 
met with them in tiananmen square before martial law was imposed 
deng has permitted only token political liberalization and was 
said to have given the order a week ago for martial law to be 
declared in beijing 
zhao has been a role model for the newstyle chinese leader he 
is suave and articulate at ease in both the communist world and 
the west he wears immaculately tailored western suits and 
regularly plays golf a sport once condemned in china as a 
bourgeois luxury 
he was born in october 1919 to a landowning family in central 
chinas henan province joined the communist party in 1938 and led 
its committee in his native county during most of the 193745 war 
with japan 
unlike the previous generation of party leaders he did not make 
the long march the 7700mile trek northwest in 193435 to escape 
the nationalist government troops in eastern china 
after the communist victory in 1949 zhao served in regional 
government and party posts he was purged during the radical 
cultural revolution of 196676 as was deng but was rehabilitated 
long before it ended 
zhao gained national prominence as party secretary and governor 
of dengs home province sichuan where he carried out the senior 
leaders policies of dismantling farm communes and allowing private 
plots and bonuses for extra work

the un environment program chief said 
friday he expects to have an international treaty to control 
climatic changes ready for signing in three years 
executive director mustafa tolba said the decision to negotiate 
a treaty with governments as soon as possible was taken at the 15th 
annual conference of the programs governing council which ended 
friday 
other resolutions include increasing uneps annual budget from 
40 million to 100 million by raising member nations voluntary 
contributions by 31 percent in 1990 and 1991 
delegates from 103 countries including 44 cabinet ministers 
attended the 12day conference at unep headquarters in nairobi 
tolba said delegates were alarmed by changing weather patterns 
and increasing health risks caused by global warming 
he said his organization would draft the treaty in consultation 
with the world meteorological organization 
we are going to renegotiate the famous montreal protocol 
tolba said its renegotiation will be more difficult than 
negotiating it in the first place he said of the nonbinding 
agreement requiring governments to reduce production of 
chlorofluorocarbons a coolant used in refrigerators and air 
conditioners that helps deplete the ozone layer 
scientists say the depletion allows the suns harmful 
ultraviolet rays to penetrate the atmosphere and raises 
temperatures on earth which causes the oceans to rise 
tolba said unep will collect scientific data on climatic changes 
and get scientists at least a majority of them to speak in one 
voice he hoped a scientific report would be ready late next 
year then negotiations could begin tolba said 
in negotiating the treaty there would be plenty of issues 
many stumbling blocks he said because it will affect every 
nations industry agriculture economy and forestry

consumer spending in april posted its best 
performance in nearly a year rising 11 percent the government 
said friday in a report that analysts said shows the economy 
remains healthy even as growth slows 
meantime the government reported a sharp improvement in the 
us trade deficit in the opening quarter of the year as exports 
jumped 57 percent 
while consumer spending rose at its fastest pace since a 13 
percent increase last june much of the growth was attributed to a 
sharp increase in auto sales because of rebates lowinterest loans 
and other industry incentives to move cars off dealers lots 
the commerce department also reported that personal income rose 
a weak 04 percent last month compared with hikes of 08 percent in 
march and 1 percent in february the april figure was the smallest 
increase since last novembers 02 percent 
but analysts blamed the sluggish income growth in april on lower 
farm subsidies over the past two months and a fallback from higher 
auto industry bonuses and retroactive social security payments in 
march 
discounting the auto sales and onetime weakness in incomes 
what you come out with is reasonably decent income and 
consumption growth which tends to make the feds softlanding 
scenario look more realistic said analyst cynthia latta of data 
resources in lexington mass 
federal reserve credittightening designed to stem inflation has 
caused some economists to worry that resulting higher interest 
rates could move the economy into a recession rather than the 
targeted soft landing 
but recent reports continue to point to an economic slowdown 
without recession 
and fridays income and spending report tells the fed that so 
far so good that theres no reason to change what theyre doing 
because it doesnt yet look like theyre guilty of overkill ms 
latta said 
sandra shaber of the futures group in washington agreed saying 
this certainly doesnt suggest that the economy is collapsing by 
any means 
but ms shaber said consumer spending which recorded increases 
of only 03 percent in march and 04 percent in feburary has 
been kind of sluggish because of higher interest rates and an 
erosion of consumer confidence 
on trade the commerce department said the 57 percent jump in 
exports boosted us overseas sales to a record 885 billion 
during january february and march 
the department said the quarterly deficit was 276 billion the 
smallest such imbalance in four years compared with 3202 billion 
in the last quarter of 1988 that was a drop of 137 percent 
the departments merchandise trade report calculated on a 
balance of payments basis also registered a record 11613 billion 
in imports but the 03 percent increase was smaller than the pace 
of export expansion 
in the other report commerce said personal income increased by 
177 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 437 
trillion in april while consumer spending rose 359 billion to an 
adjusted annual 342 trillion rate consumer spending represents 
about twothirds of overall economic activity 
the consumer spending figure includes a 32 percent increase in 
durable goods big ticket items such as cars expected to last 
three years or more to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4671 billion durable spending fell the previous two months when 
auto sales were weak 
nondurable goods purchases rose 07 percent and spending on 
services was up 08 percent in april 
the change in disposable income income after taxes 
registered a flat zero last month down from marchs 08 percent 
increase higherthanusual federal income tax payments in april 
because of 1986 changes in tax law resulted in much of the decline 
the personal savings rate suffered from the increase in tax 
payments falling to 53 percent from a threeyear high of 63 
percent in march 
wages and salaries rose 06 percent to 261 trillion at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate

several hundred soviets defied a ban on 
unauthorized meetings friday and gathered in a downtown square to 
criticize their new parliament hours after it defeated reformers 
attempts to sanction their gathering 
police with megaphones urged the crowd to disperse or go to an 
approved meeting place in a giant parking lot away from the city 
center but only a handful showed up at the officially approved 
meeting place 
authorities took no immediate action to break up the gathering 
in moscows pushkin square a frequent gathering spot for political 
discussions and protests 
the apparatus is still controlling everything said one man 
who identified himself only as a taxi driver as he discussed the 
action at the congress of peoples deputies everything is the 
same as always 
you can compare the congress to an old cake chimed in 
another they sprinkle some chocolate on the top some democracy 
but at the bottom its stale 
the only victory was that they managed to have some 
discussion said alexander khatov in a typical comment about 
reformers at the congress of peoples deputies convened thursday 
a anonymous leaflet distributed in the square said a few 
deputies truly elected by the people are trying to defend what has 
been promised but everything is being done according to a 
previously worked out scenario just as it always was 
what are we the people doing at this moment which could 
become the turning point in our history of slavery we the people 
are doing what weve been doing since 1917 were looking for food 
and now soap as well 
fridays meeting followed police action to break up a similar 
gathering called late thursday by the democratic union a 
selfstyled opposition group 
the use of special antiriot forces to disperse the crowd 
triggered a heated quarrel friday in the congress where prominent 
reformer tatyana zaslavskaya urged the parliament to ask moscow 
city authorities to lift their ban on unsanctioned political 
meetings for the duration of the session 
at the direction of president mikhail s gorbachev who chaired 
the televised proceedings interior minister vadim bakatin said 
meetings discussing actions at the congress had taken place without 
incident across the soviet union the moscow meeting was different 
he said because it had been banned in advance by the authorities 
the top police officials statement touched off a furor on the 
congress floor some deputies shouted at one another while others 
from conservative central asia applauded to drown out speeches by 
liberal moscow deputies sergei stankevich and andrei d sakharov 
sakharov 68 said that despite exhaustion from 13 hours of 
congress proceedings thursday he went to the square after being 
called at home by a weeping girl he urged his fellow deputies to 
meet with the young activists after each day of congress debate 
we must not surround these people with police units he 
said recalling events in the georgian capital of tbilisi last 
month where at least 20 people died after security forces moved 
against a proindependence protest 
gorbachev stopped the debate by putting zaslavskayas call to a 
vote 
her proposal was defeated with 831 deputies supporting her 
1261 against and 30 abstaining 
before the results were announced gorbachev said he had 
received word from moscow communist party boss lev n zaikov that 
city authorities would sanction a voters meeting in moscow but 
in the stadium parking lot well away from pushkin square

suppliers promised plenty of gasoline for local 
drivers and the thousands of tourists expected over the holiday 
weekend despite the loss of a pipeline providing 90 percent of the 
citys supply 
but industry officials warned that the situation could change if 
motorists succumbed to panic buying in the wake of thursdays 
pipeline explosion in san bernardino calif 
the people of this town need to be responsible enough to not 
go crazy and not alter their purchasing habits said jack greco 
chairman of the nevada gasoline retailers association 
reserves were being trucked into southern nevada from california 
refineries 300 miles away officials said 
the gasoline supply was disrupted by the blast at san bernardino 
knocked out the calnev underground pipeline the chief conduit for 
gasoline and diesel fuel for the las vegas valley 
the explosion which killed at least three people and shut the 
pipeline indefinitely was in the same place that a freight train 
derailed two weeks ago and plowed into nearby houses killing four 
inspectors checked the pipeline after that accident and believed 
that it had not been damaged 
holly rea a spokeswoman for gatx the chicagobased company 
that owns the pipeline said there were six days worth of gasoline 
and a twoday supply of diesel fuel stored in tanks in las vegas 
a spot check of some of the citys busiest stations revealed no 
run on the pumps as of friday morning 
there are no long lines or anything like that said pj 
johnson an employee at a texaco station at a busy intersection on 
the citys east side theres no big rush business is just 
normal i guess 
the concern over the pipeline disruption was heightened by the 
fact that more than 100000 visitors were expected here for the 
threeday memorial day weekend one of the busiest of the year in 
las vegas nearly half of them were expected to come by car 
trucking fuel to southern nevada will be more expensive but oil 
company officials said that doesnt necessarily mean a rise in 
prices at the pump it will certainly increase our costs but 
well absorb that because we want to stay competitive said 
chevron spokesman mike libbey

the united states enjoyed its best trading 
performance in four years from january through march as the deficit 
fell 137 percent to 2763 billion the government reported friday 
the commerce department said that a decline in nonoil imports 
and the highest level of farm exports in almost eight years helped 
to lower the deficit from the fourth quarter level of 3202 
billion 
propelled by the higher farm sales exports jumped 57 percent 
in the first quarter to a new record of 8850 billion 
imports hit an alltime high as well of 11613 billion but the 
03 percent increase was much smaller than the pace of export 
expansion 
fridays report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance 
of payments basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the 
commerce departments monthly merchandise trade reports 
the totals are slightly different because the new report 
excludes military sales by the us government to foreign 
governments and makes other minor adjustments to the monthly 
figures 
while the bush administration and some analysts are looking for 
the first quarter trade improvement to continue other private 
economists expressed fears that deficit will begin widening in 
coming months 
they are particularly worried about the strength in the dollar 
which makes american products more expensive on overseas markets 
and rising oil prices which boost the countrys foreign oil bill 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc in 
lexington mass predicted that the trade deficit for the entire 
year will be essentially unchanged from the 12722 billion deficit 
in 1988 
while agricultural sales were up sharply in the first quarter 
that sector is really threatened by the strength in the dollar 
because there are so many other countries willing to supply the 
products if the american price becomes uncompetitive she said 
but allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said he was 
more optimistic that the us trade deficit would continue 
narrowing this year helped out by faster growth overseas and 
slower us growth which would cut the demand for imports 
so long as the economies of the world stay strong there is 
every reason to believe that our exports will keep doing well he 
said 
the bush administration which has staked its economic forecast 
on a belief exports will keep climbing is trying to help the 
process along with aggressive efforts to open foreign markets 
the administration on thursday announced that it was threatening 
japan brazil and india with special tariffs in an effort to reduce 
barriers blocking the sale of american products in those countries 
the big jump in exports in the first quarter reflected an 112 
percent surge in sales of american farm products which climbed to 
1088 billion the highest level since the second quarter of 1981 
sales of manufactured goods and other items in the nonfarm 
category were up by 367 billion to 7761 billion reflecting 
strength in sales of industrial supplies aircraft and consumer 
goods 
the rise in imports came entirely from an increase in petroleum 
imports which shot up 175 percent to 1083 billion with the 
advance coming from the higher cost of oil 
nonpetroleum imports declined by 123 billion to 10530 
billion reflecting a drop in demand for consumer goods and autos 
the improved trade performance put the quarterly deficit at the 
lowest level since a 257 billion imbalance in the first quarter 
of 1985 
the deficit with the countries of western europe fell to 102 
billion the lowest level in almost six years as usual the 
largest deficit was with japan an imbalance of 1316 billion 
down 145 percent from the fourth quarter

a gasoline pipeline exploded and 
killed three people just days after residents were assured it had 
not been damaged by a runaway train that plowed through the same 
neighborhood two weeks ago 
it looks like a bomb went off over duffy street city 
attorney james penman said after the thursday morning blast that 
sent flames 300 feet skyward and produced heat so intense that pets 
and corn stalks were singed two blocks away 
thirtyone people were injured in the explosion that also 
destroyed 10 homes and 18 cars about 300 people were ordered to 
leave their homes for the night and the pipeline break cut off las 
vegas chief source of gasoline and diesel fuel 
up to seven people were unaccountedfor after the blast but by 
midmorning today authorities said all but one had been located 
its like a nightmare said delores jones whose house was 
destroyed by the fire i havent slept since the train wreck 
its come back to haunt me 
the may 12 train wreck leveled a row of homes and killed four 
people 
national transportation safety board personnel gathered here 
today to investigate the explosion and calnev pipeline co manager 
ken seal said there was a very good possibility the companys 
14inch pipeline was damaged by the train accident 
the city and an attorney for more than 100 residents announced 
plans to file lawsuits against the las vegas company the residents 
also plan to sue the city and the rail line southern pacific 
we did not feel in the first place they should have started up 
that railroad as quickly as they did and we particularly tried to 
get the pipeline shut down now look what happened said 
residents attorney james h davis who was hired after the train 
wreck 
the neighborhood was evacuated for several days after the train 
jumped the track because of fears the pipeline might have been 
weakened the city was assured the line was safe when it reopened 
several days ago penman said 
the body of a woman killed in the blast was found in the back 
yard of a home pinned to a chainlink fence the other two 
fatalities an adult and child were found next door 
a woman said she ran out of her house she left behind her 
sister her cousin and a 6monthold baby inside and she looked 
back and the house blew up behind her said councilwoman valerie 
popeludlam 
just before the blast a fountain of gasoline spouted above 
ground said paul allaire a city information officer it was up 
in the air high pressure like a geyser he said 
the pipeline carries gasoline diesel and jet fuel from a tank 
farm in colton several miles from the blaze site to southern 
nevada supplying the las vegas valley with 90 percent of its fuel 
it was buried 6 feet deep near the spot where the train derailed 
on the eve of the memorial day weekend las vegas was left with 
less than a weeks supply of gasoline and only a couple of days 
worth of diesel fuel gas was being trucked into the city and spot 
checks this morning showed no immediate signs of panicbuying by 
motorists 
pj johnson a worker at a texaco station at a busy 
intersection on las vegas east side said pumps were a little 
busier but there are no lines or anything like that theres 
really no big rush 
once the explosion occurred the flow of fuel through the 
pipeline was shut off said jed robinson calnevs general manager 
in san bernardino but fuel remaining in the shattered pipe 
continued to burn fiercely through much of the day robinson said 
up to 12000 gallons of gasoline burned 
residents have complained recently that train wheels throw off 
sparks as they pass and that railroad crews have to walk alongside 
afterward and douse small fires 
a freight train passed over the tracks 10 minutes before the 
explosion said southern pacific spokesman bob taggart 
there was no immediate evidence however that sparks from the 
passing train triggered the blast

a federal judge on friday moved back the 
starting date of the irancontra trial of a former cia agent to 
july 24 
us district judge claude hilton granted the twoweek delay 
after lawyers for joseph fernandez said the governments case has 
been tainted with testimony given under immunity from prosecution 
fernandez the cias former station chief in costa rica is 
accused of covering up his ties to oliver norths secret contra 
resupply operation the network operated during a congressional ban 
on military aid to the nicaraguan rebel force 
fernandez is accused of obstructing and making false statements 
to the cias inspector general and the presidentially appointed 
tower commission early in 1987 
at a court hearing fernandezs lawyer thomas wilson said that 
cole black of the cias inspector general office had informed the 
prosecution that he had read fernandezs immunized congressional 
testimony detailing many of the activities for which he is now 
accused of crimes 
black told the prosecution he would be unable to ferret out 
immunized testimony from nonimmunized testimony wilson said 
black was interviewed for three hours by the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh and testified before a grand jury for two 
hours 
prosecutor robert longstreth disputed wilsons assertion saying 
wilson had been able to come up with just a single example of 
blacks testimony possibly being tainted 
we think blacks testimony is clean said longstreth 
under a supreme court ruling the government may not make any 
use of a persons immunized testimony in building a case against 
him 
another cia employee louis dupart compliance officer for the 
cias central american task force steeped himself in immunized 
testimony which he used to brief his superiors who also faced 
questioning in the irancontra affair said wilson 
the lawyer said the government interviewed dupart 12 times 
hilton said he might require the prosecution to demonstrate more 
conclusively that its case wasnt tainted by immunized testimony 
the judge set aside july 10 to hear any motions concerning the 
use of classified information the use of immunized testimony or 
other matters 
hilton also directed the prosecution to turn over to fernandez 
for use in his defense a deposition of lewis tambs a former us 
ambassador to costa rica 
one of the charges is that fernandez falsely told the cia 
inspector general that an airstrip in costa rica built by the north 
network was initiated by the costa rican government 
prosecutor laurence shtasel said tambs deposition shows only 
why they costa rican officials agreed to it subsequently

the department of veterans affairs said friday 
that lack of funds is forcing it to curtail medical services 
va secretary edward derwinski announced a freeze except in 
emergencies on accepting new patients with nonserviceconnected 
ailments whose incomes are above certain limits 
rep g v sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee said the new limit essentially would 
exclude such veterans with incomes greater than 16476 
this is just sad that the veteran again is caught in the 
squeeze play of politics said thomas a sherwood director for 
health policy and planning at the vietnam veterans of america 
there is no question that this will affect a large number of 
veterans said cooper t holt executive director of the 
washington office of the veterans of foreign wars 
the va also announced that vacant staff positions at va 
facilities will not be filled the agency will stop spending for 
the maintenance and purchase of certain equipment and the startup 
of several projects will be delayed 
i must take these actions to keep the system functioning 
within the limits of our resources said derwinski he said the 
cuts should allow the agency to contunue operating at a reduced 
level until june 15 
by then he said he hopes congress will have resolved an 
impasse that has prevented approval of a supplemental funding bill 
for the department if that does not occur said derwinski more 
drastic cuts may be needed 
the house passed a supplemental appropriation bill last week 
including 340 million to continue operations of va health care 
facilities through the remainder of the fiscal year 
the senate however passed a measure including money only 
through june 15 the house balked at that limit and the dispute 
remains unresolved 
these folks just cant get together to do what is best for the 
veterans that we are supposed to be serving said sherwood 
some vets have no choice but to rely on the va for medical 
care he said 
montgomery said some alcohol and drug treatment service have 
already been cut back and that nursing home and hospital beds will 
have to be closed for lack of staff

a surgeon saved the life of a gunshot victim by 
plugging the bullet holes in his heart with her fingers and 
massaging the organ to keep it beating during a 14minute 
helicopter ride to a trauma center 
dr wendy marshall cradled the exposed heart in her hands and 
kept the patient from bleeding to death while she supervised his 
transfer thursday from a joliet hospital to a suburban trauma 
center equipped for openheart surgery 
surgeons there repaired the holes and the patient tommy lee 
tony hairston was doing well friday said ms marshall 
director of loyola university medical centers trauma unit and its 
air medical service 
we were lucky she said in an interview from suburban 
maywood a day after the feat which the hospitals chairman of 
surgery dr robert j freeark called unprecedented and heroic 
its one for the books thats for sure said dr john 
barrett director of the areas busiest trauma unit at cook county 
hospital 
ms marshall said the good judgment of surgeons at silver cross 
hospital in joliet to call for help before it was too late coupled 
with the efficiency of her medical support staff made the dramatic 
transfer possible 
its a team effort she said thats the success of the 
system 
the team was lucky because a major storm system cleared the area 
just two hours before ms marshall was summoned at 5 am if the 
storms had still been going on we would not have been able to 
fly she said 
she said the patient likely would not have survived transfer by 
ambulance joliet is about 25 miles southwest of maywood 
hairston 29 a joliet landscaper was shot wednesday night 
after an argument with a neighbor over missing property police 
said the neighbor robert knox was charged with attempted murder 
armed violence and unlawful use of a weapon police said 
hairston was rushed to silver cross where an operation was 
performed however after surgery he started bleeding again 
a second operation revealed the bullet wounds in the heart 
which could not be repaired without a heartbypass machine which 
silver cross lacks surgeons called for help and ms marshall 
arrived 23 minutes later 
freeark said its not unusual for a trauma surgeon to use 
fingers to block holes in the heart but that usually takes place 
in an emergency room until you can get the patient to the 
operating room 
to my knowledge no one has ever transferred a patient by any 
means ambulance or certainly helicopter from one hospital to 
another while a surgeon had a finger occluding a hole in the 
heart freeark said 
he added that few surgeons would have thought to try the 
transfer and without it no question the patient would have 
died 
adding to the difficulty was the fact that hairstons heart 
stopped beating three times for a total of eight minutes during 
the trip requiring ms marshall to massage the organ between her 
hands while keeping her fingers in the holes to stimulate it to 
pump again 
it would have been very easy to get discouraged with the whole 
thing anywhere along the way freeark said but thats dr 
marshall she doesnt quit

it took a college auditorium 
to hold all the people who wanted to testify or sit in on a 
presentence hearing for four teenage vandals who damaged a high 
school so badly it is still closed two months later 
the first thing that crosses your mind is lock them up for 10 
years dennis thul a high school parent testified at the 
thursday night hearing attended by more than 300 people but after 
reflecting thul said what i would like to see is harsh 
punishment in community service 
other parents along with teachers classmates and taxpayers 
recommended community service counseling restitution even some 
jail time for that damage that ranges upwards of 6 million but 
none recommended extended prison sentences 
one student handed in a petition he said was signed by 285 
people urging that the four defendants not be sent to prison 
i expected in some ways tonight to have a vigilante 
atmosphere said parent aethan hart who expressed relief at what 
he called a thoughtful process 
many of the approximately 30 people who testified at inver hills 
community college expressed sympathy for the teenagers families 
and pleaded with the judges to impose sentences that allow for 
rehabilitation 
but they also expressed anger and frustration over students 
projects that were destroyed and the disruption it caused 
the 1220student henry sibley high school in the st paul 
suburb of mendota heights has been closed since the march 23 
damage the vandals destroyed student projects and teaching 
equipment and turned on fire hoses that soaked asbestos 
contaminating air in the building 
sibley students are attending another school during the repair 
and cleanup 
all four defendants three of them 18 years old and one 17 have 
pleaded guilty to felony firstdegree criminal dmage to property 
thirddegree burglary and theft on june 12 dakota county district 
judge thomas lacy is to sentence jason lasch and the juvenile 
while district judge william thuet is to sentence edward easton and 
matthew klein 
all four attended the presentence hearing but said nothing 
lasch was the only one who wasnt a student at sibley at the time 
of the vandalism and klein was the only one unable to make his 
25000 bail he has been in jail since the end of march 
state law requires the state corrections department to get from 
crime victims a statement of the damage they suffered and their 
opinions on sentencing because of the unusually large number of 
victims in this case the judges decided to hold the hearing in the 
auditorium 
dakota county attorney james backstrom has said the case 
justifies an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines which 
call for no more than a year in the county jail and 10 years of 
probation for the 18yearolds 
the juvenile cannot be sentenced to community service or a 
juvenile institution past his 19th birthday which is 13 months 
from now

mikhail s gorbachev whose title of president was 
largely ceremonial window dressing now has new power and perhaps 
new accountability to go with his old title 
gorbachev assumed a more powerful presidency on thursday after 
winning more than 95 percent of the votes from the new congress of 
peoples deputies the new position replaces the largely ceremonial 
presidency he held previously as the soviet unions official head 
of state 
the new presidency entitles gorbachev to serve as head of the 
nations supreme military body the defense council to negotiate 
and sign treaties and to draft decrees and orders 
however constitutional amendments passed in november mean that 
the new president will be subject on paper at least to control 
by a new fulltime legislature the supreme soviet 
that new body composed of 542 people chosen from the 2250seat 
congress will have extensive powers to oversee soviet economic 
financial social foreign affairs and defense policy 
a bicameral body that is intended to hold two annual sessions of 
about four months each the supreme soviet also will be empowered 
to schedule nationwide elections appoint the premier elect the 
top national court and endorse senior prosecutors 
after heated debate in the old soviet parliament last fall 
gorbachev agreed that the supreme soviet also would have the right 
to repeal presidential decrees 
gorbachev as communist party chief holds ultimate power but 
as president he can be recalled by the congress which will elect 
presidents once every five years there is a twoterm limit on one 
person holding the office 
many of the powers now vested in the president the supreme 
soviet and the directly elected congress rested formally in the 
past with the parliament and the chairman of its executive 
presidium who came to be known as the president 
in practice however as writer chingiz aitmatov noted in a 
speech nominating gorbachev for the new presidency on thursday the 
supreme soviet parliament was under strong pressure from 
authoritarian regimes and legislators passed laws in ritual votes 
as if in a theater 
for decades real power rested with the head of the ruling 
communist party and his fellow members of the top party body the 
politburo the oldstyle presidency acquired prominence only with 
the ascent of leonid i brezhnev who held the ceremonial post from 
1960 to june 1964 
months later brezhnev was chosen as the compromise candidate of 
rival politburo factions battling to oust nikita s khrushchev from 
the kremlin 
brezhnev did not resume the ceremonial title of president again 
until june 1977 following the ouster of nikolai v podgorny from 
the post after brezhnevs death in june 1982 his successor as 
party chief yuri v andropov assumed the post as did konstantin 
u chernenko after him 
gorbachev named communist party leader in march 1985 at first 
put veteran foreign minister andrei a gromyko into the presidency 
in the summer of 1985 and took the post himself only in october 
when gromyko retired from politics 
the ceremonial nature of the past presidency led congress deputy 
konstantin d lubenchenko to proclaim thursday during debate on 
gorbachevs candidacy that we dont have a president of the 
country and are only just beginning to create one 
several speakers in thursdays debate mindful of past 
autocracy expressed doubts about uniting the powers of soviet 
president and communist party chief in one man 
gorbachev pledged not to repeat the abuses of the past but it 
will be up to the new parliament to hold him to his promise

a grand jury refused to indict a young 
mother for manslaughter in the prenatal cocainelinked death of 
her 2dayold daughter authorities said friday 
the case of melanie green 24 sparked heated debate over the 
merits of such prosecution after winnebago county states attorney 
paul logli charged her may 9 with involuntary manslaughter and 
delivery during pregancy of a controlled substance to a minor 
the move drew fire from some members of the medical social 
service and legal communities who argued fear of prosecution could 
prevent drugabusing motherstobe from seeking medical help 
this office brought the charges and sought the indictment 
because we believed at that time and still do believe that it was 
an appropriate response to the death of a newborn child logli 
said friday at a news conference 
there are no winners in a case like this said winnebago 
county public defender gary pumilia who accompanied ms green to 
thursdays grand jury proceeding 
a case like this gets a lot of publicity but the battle in 
the trenches is being fought in juvenile court in childabuse 
and custody cases involving suspected prenatal drug abuse he said 
ms greens daughter bianca was 2 days old when she died feb 
4 of oxygen deprivation attributed to her mothers alleged cocaine 
use during pregnancy prenatal exposure to the drug can cause 
numerous health problems including low birth weight impaired 
motor ability irritability that can hinder learning strokes and 
seizures 
ms green who does not have a telephone could not be reached 
immediately for comment on the grand jury action 
she had said earlier i loved her i did she refused to 
discuss her alleged drug use but said authorities should help 
people i tried to get help but i couldnt get any 
logli called for state legislation to address the very 
pressing issues brought on by this prosecution citing the need 
to protect infants eliminate drug abuse among pregnant women and 
provide for criminal prosecution in the event of injury 
while charges related to the babys death have been dropped 
prosecutors have not decided whether to pursue drugabuse charges 
against ms green logli said adding he also was concerned about 
the welfare of her son a firstgrader 
attorney colleen connell of the american civil liberties union 
which was representing ms green had said most drug rehabilitation 
programs will not accept pregnant women 
cocaine was found in biancas system and in her mothers dr p 
john seward the county coroner said the drug was carried through 
the placenta to the fetus reducing biancas ability to accept 
oxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage 
logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled 
substance to a minor

the arab league summit closed two 
days late friday after adopting what iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz called a gentlemans agreement for syria to withdraw its 
troops from lebanon 
syrian intransigence prevented any resolution explicitly calling 
for the syrian army to leave lebanon the main iraqi objective 
several times the syrianiraqi confrontation almost led to the 
collapse of the summit 
the arab leaders appointed a threemember committee and gave it 
six months to supervise a ceasefire reconvene lebanons 
parliament arrange the appointment of a president and amend the 
constitution for more balanced powersharing between the warring 
moslems and christians 
the negotiators are moroccos king hassan ii king fahd of saudi 
arabia and algerias president chadli bendjedid 
in beirut surprising support for the peace plan came from 
acting prime minister salim hoss the moslem leader whose closest 
ally is syria 
i welcome the resolutions of the arab summit and hope they 
will be implemented as soon as possible hoss said in a brief 
statement 
his christian opponent gen michel aoun will not comment until 
after an emergency meeting saturday of his rival cabinet aouns 
spokesman said 
but the christian lebanese broadcasting corp said the summit 
failed to offer anything more than lip service to help resolve 
the lebanon crisis 
the summit also has failed to devise a mechanism to monitor a 
ceasefire and made no reference to the role of the syrian army in 
lebanon it said 
aoun has insisted on a syrian pullout as a precondition for a 
moslemchristian dialogue on political reforms to end the 14year 
civil war 
in casablanca the war of words between arch foes syria and iraq 
caused chaotic scenes and almost led the summit to collapse 
as a result the meeting continued for four days longer than 
any summit in the arab leagues 44year history moroccan 
television said 
iraqs aziz told reporters that if syria does not withdraw 
within six months his government will demand another summit 
the conference resolution fell short of what must be done on 
this important issue aziz said but he added the leaders reached 
a gentlemans agreement for a pullout of syrian troops first 
from beirut then from other regions 
syria has 40000 troops in moslem west beirut and lebanons 
eastern and northern provinces under a 1976 league peacekeeping 
mandate 
secretarygeneral chedli klibi read the final communique closing 
the summit called primarily to reinstate egypt in the 22nation 
league after a 10year suspension for making peace with israel 
delegates provided the text of other resolutions 
the summit adopted a sevenpoint plan on lebanon that stressed 
the countrys unity arab identity territorial integrity and 
independence it asserted the fate of lebanon is a general arab 
responsibility and called on all lebanese factions to respect 
the muchfractured ceasefire called by the arab league last april 
king hassans committee was asked 
to invite lebanese legislators to a conference to prepare a 
political reform document that would form the basis for national 
reconciliation 
to get parliament to ratify the document 
to arrange for parliament to elect a president who would form a 
government of national reconciliation that would amend the 
constitution a new constitution likely would reflect the wishes of 
lebanons moslem majority shrinking the power of the minority 
christians who traditionally have dominated lebanese politics 
to support the government in exercising full sovereignty over 
all lebanese territory 
the last refers not only to syrian troops but also about 2000 
iranian revolutionary guards in lebanon at syrias invitation and 
about 1000 israeli troops that patrol the selfdesignated security 
zone israel carved out of southern lebanon after its 198285 
invasion 
the summit communique condemned continued israeli aggression 
against lebanon and its sovereignty 
arab leaders agreed to pay a 120 million lump sum and provide 
monthly payments of 43 million promised last year to support the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied territories the 
palestine liberation organization complained to the meeting that 
only libya and saudi arabia had paid up 
it supported plo opposition to an israeli proposal for elections 
on the occupied west bank and gaza strip of palestinians who would 
negotiate with israel for limited selfrule 
the summit backed plo demands that elections be held under 
international supervision within the framework of a comprehensive 
peace process since the israeli scheme aims at undermining the 
uprising and sidestepping the plo and the palestinian peoples 
inalienable national rights

the singer company has been barred from 
selling any of its assets or paying stock dividends pending a 
lawsuit over claims a former subsidiary defrauded the government 
the company named as a codefendant in a civil suit against its 
former link flight simulation division was also ordered not to 
incur any new debt or make any payments to investor paul bilzerian 
the florida financier who acquired the company last year 
the preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge in 
baltimore was sought by the justice department which last march 
joined the 231 million lawsuit that had originally been filed by a 
former link flight pricing administrator 
the complaint charges that the company cheated the defense 
department out of 77 million by submitting false contract bid data 
on flight simulation equipment to train pilots it seeks triple 
damages from link flight which is now owned by cae industries ltd 
of toronto 
singer is named as a defendant in the false claims act suit 
along with the canadian company 
in a brief order signed thursday us district judge herbert f

the federal aviation administration denied 
friday a petition from a group of older pilots to be allowed to fly 
airliners after age 60 saying older pilots are more likely to be 
involved in accidents 
the agency announced however that it would fund a detailed 
study of pilot age and accident rates and indicated it might be 
willing to certify individual pilots over 60 if a way can be found 
to determine their capacities 
what is needed and what the petitioners have failed to show 
the faa said is a way to discriminate between those who 
contribute to the adverse trend of increasing accidents involving 
older pilots and those who do not 
the faa said it is willing to look at any scientific evidence 
that will help in setting criteria for selecting older pilots who 
have a low accident risk 
the issue has simmered since the 1950s when the faa first 
ordered that airline pilots and copilots must retire at 60 it 
attracted renewed interest after feb 24 when 59yearold united 
airlines pilot david cronin guided a boeing 747 to a safe landing 
in honolulu after a section of its fuselage blew off sending nine 
passengers to their deaths 
cronin was hailed as a hero for his secondtolast commercial 
flight before retirement pilots have for years been saying the faa 
rule needlessly discriminates on the bases of age 
the latest denial came in a petition for exemption from the 
retirement rule filed by a group of pilots in may 1986 the faa 
rejected it 16 months later the pilots then went to court and the 
us court of appeals in chicago required the faa to take another 
look at the petition 
the faa has long contended that pilots past the age of 60 are 
more likely to suffer performance degradation and that there is no 
way to accurately predict its onset the faa said it said there 
is evidence that older pilots skills deteriorate and statistics 
that show they are more likely to be involved in accidents 
the agency noted that older pilots contend that their experience 
in the cockpit makes up for any problem associated with being over 
60 but it said the evidence shows otherwise

after 13 years of protests and wrangling 
seabrook nuclear power plant officials got their testing license 
friday and began laying plans to start their first atomic chain 
reaction possibly within a week 
the license the biggest milestone yet for a project that is 10 
years late and billions over budget was granted by the nuclear 
regulatory commission friday morning a federal appeals court 
declined to delay the tests late thursday 
the license does not settle disputes over evacuation planning 
for crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10 miles of 
seabrook the key issue blocking commercial operation of the 6 
billion reactor 
seabrook officials hope to receive a commercial license in the 
fall but massachusetts gov michael dukakis and other plant foes 
promise to keep fighting to the us supreme court if necessary 
but the fact is the lowpower license means that all the 
technical issues have been resolved and thats a very critical 
step said the plants top executive edward brown 
relief was palpable among officials at a project that has faced 
countless licensing and financial setbacks and years of 
highvisibility demonstrations 
inside the seabrook gates a sign on the road leading to the 
power plant and posters inside the administration building 
proclaimed license received a time for pride a time for 
power 
beaming plant executives congratulated each other as they read 
copies of the freshly issued license 
before starting the testing plant operators planned to spend a 
day or so reviewing voluminous technical specifications attached to 
the license joseph grillo the plants operations manager said he 
expected no surprises 
we know pretty much whats coming grillo said we havent 
been doing this in a vacuum weve been negotiating with the nrc 
staff on technical issues 
the testing process likely will start this weekend plant 
officials said valves will be opened and water will be pumped 
through the reactor coolant system friction from the rapid 
circulation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to its 
operating temperature of 557 degrees 
after a fiveday warmup operators would set the stage for a 
nuclear chain reaction by withdrawing neutronabsorbing control 
rods from the reactor fuel core and reducing the amount of 
neutronabsorbing boron in the coolant water eventually letting 
uranium atoms start fissioning 
brown estimated the plant would achieve initial criticality 
its first selfsustained fission reaction within seven to 10 
days 
that could coincide with a rally and mass civil disobedience 
action planned months ago for next weekend by the clamshell 
alliance which for 13 years has organized protests that have 
resulted in nearly 2500 arrests and in the name seabrook becoming 
synonymous with antinuclear activism 
will we modify our schedule to tie into what the demonstrators 
are doing at any point in time brown said the answer is no 
clamshell organizers vowing nonviolence say protesters plan 
to try to climb fences surrounding the site but wont try to reach 
an inner fence around the plant itself 
seabrooks opponents argue that stopping the plant is crucial 
for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people who live 
nearby or crowd seacoast beaches as close as 17 miles from the 
reactor 
brown president of seabrook operator new hampshire yankee 
maintains that seabrook is the safest power plant thats ever 
been built and that evacuation plans for surrounding communities 
would protect the public in the unlikely event of an accident 
federal licensing board hearings on the plans are in progress 
seabrook supporters say the 1150megawatt reactor is vitally 
needed to meet new englands burgeoning power demand 
nuclear industry officials worldwide also see seabrook as 
crucial to their hopes of fostering development of a new generation 
of reactors brown acknowledged 
were aware the rest of the industry is watching us but were 
not out there fighting the industrys battles he said 
seabrook officials had fought nearly three years for the 
lowpower license after the plant was completed in july 1986

the pentagon announced friday that it has 
readjusted a key supplemental housing allowance and more than 
800000 people in the military services will see a small increase 
in that part of their paycheck 
the change in the variable housing allowance set to begin june 
1 will be the second increase this year 
the pentagon declined to estimate the average increase on a 
percentage basis saying all the geographic factors hadnt been 
computed 
but figures released by the defense department suggest the 
increase will exceed this years first hike of 34 percent and 
will range from an average 480 a month extra for a private to 
1301 a month extra for a colonel 
military officials boosted the allowance in january 
deliberately holding down the size of that hike to make sure the 
pentagon didnt exceed a congressional limit of 122 billion for 
the entire program 
the vha rate increase effective june 1 is designed to 
increase the amount that servicemembers receive and reduce the 
outofpocket housing costs while remaining below the ceiling 
the pentagon said in a statement 
all men and women in the military who are not required to live 
in government quarters receive a basic housing allowance each 
month since 1981 those men and women assigned to bases in 
highcost parts of the country have also received a variable 
housing allowance 
congress authorized the supplemental allowance with the goal of 
standardizing the housing purchasing power of those in the military 
regardless of where they are located 
the payments can range from a few dollars a month to more than 
300 a month depending upon the area rank of the individual and 
whether there are dependents in some special cases such as in 
alaska the payment can exceed 500 a month 
currently about 815000 of the nations 21 million activeduty 
people in the service are receiving a monthly variable housing 
assistance payment 
the pentagon has requested a 36 percent increase in the payment 
in the fiscal 1990 budget which is now undergoing congressional 
review

jewish settlers shot up a west bank village 
friday in the second vigilante raid in two days wounding at least 
three people and damaging houses and cars residents and israel 
radio said 
the radio reported another raid friday evening but gave no 
details 
fifteen armed settlers conducted a patrol friday in hebron 
where the first vigilante raid occurred the night before breaking 
into several houses five paratroopers who escorted them did not 
interfere but fired into the air with the settlers when 
palestinians threw stones 
a labor party minister in the coalition government claimed the 
vigilantism among the 70000 jewish settlers in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip was intended to block prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs plan for palestinian elections 
a dissident cabinet minister from shamirs conservative likud 
bloc announced opposition to the proposal and trade minister ariel 
sharon the leading likud opponent toured the west bank to show 
support for the settlers 
shamir returning from a trip abroad would not answer questions 
about settler raids and said only i dont think we are facing a 
very serious situation if its necessary to do something we shall 
do it 
soldiers dispersed a march by about 500 arabs in the dheisheh 
refugee camp near bethlehem with gunfire wounding seven people 
the protesters most wearing masks raised outlawed palestinian 
flags and shouted slogans through portable loudspeakers the march 
commemorated three palestinians killed by soldiers last month 
arab hospital officials in east jerusalem and bethlehem said a 
15yearold girl was hospitalized with a stomach wound another 
young woman had leg wounds and five people were treated and 
released 
residents of arura a village of 1400 palestinians about 20 
miles north of jerusalem said 20 to 40 settlers invaded it from 
surrounding hills at 9 am mahmoud salah a teacher told the 
associated press they started shooting at houses and people in the 
streets 
we are sure they were settlers he said they were dressed 
in civilian clothes and did not act like security agents because 
they fired indiscriminately 
he said men women and children rushed out and began pelted the 
attackers with stones salah said the settlers left after three 
hours 
the daughter of village leader yusef mahmoud who would not give 
her first name said the invaders smashed two cars and punctured 
the windows of five houses with bullets

officials at nearby ramallah hospital reported only three 
casualties including 19yearold suleiman abu kandil with a 
serious stomach wound 
mahmound the village leader said soldiers arrived soon after

west bank fired into arab homes on the outskirts of neighboring 
hebron palestinians said there were no casualties but windows of 
at least six houses were smashed 
aharon domb of the hebron information center run by the settlers 
said the raid was a response to firebomb attacks on two 
israeliowned cars thursday which caused no injuries 
since the politicians are not applying the law kiryat arba 
residents were forced to respond to the arab rioters he said on 
israel radio they did this in part by firing straight into 
buildings 
health minister yaacov tsur of labor blamed the rise in settler 
violence on the settlement leaders clear desire to torpedo the

withdraw from the territories where an uprising began nearly 18 
months ago at least 498 palestinains have been killed and 22

step toward a palestinian state which they consider a threat to 
israels existence 
rebels in the conservative bloc have demanded a meeting of the 
2600member likud central committee to defeat or amend the plan 
and have the support of the three most powerful figures after the 
prime minister sharon housing minister david levy and economy

huge grain sales to the soviet union part of 
it wheat subsidized by the american taxpayer are helping push us 
agricultural exports to a sevenyear high of 39 billion the 
agriculture department said friday 
the new export forecast was up 1 billion from the previous 
projection made in february the nearrecord 39 billion would be 
for the fiscal year that will end on sept 30 only 1981 and 1982 
would be greater 
if realized export value would be the highest since fiscal 
1982 the report said prospective larger coarse grain sales to 
the soviet union mainly corn account for much of the increase 
us grain sales to the soviets are now expected to reach a record 
high 
but the report added that an improved outlook for cotton and 
livestock products also have contributed to the upward revision 
in the export total 
although total us agricultural export values are up sharply 
from a decade low of 263 billion just three years ago they still 
are below the record sales of 438 billion in the 1981 fiscal 
year when actual quantities totaled more than 160 million tons 
exports dropped to 391 billion and 1579 million tons in 1982 
the report said the 1989 tonnage will decline to 1465 million 
tons from 1483 million last year but higher prices will more than 
offset the smaller quantity and boost the total value 
christopher e goldthwait acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said in a related 
announcement that the soviet union has bought an additional 300000 
metric tons of us wheat under a new line of subsidies approved by 
president bush earlier in the month 
under pressure from wheat area lawmakers bush on may 2 approved 
a new subsidy line for moscow of 15 million tons about half of 
what had been sought the soviets had been buying subsidized wheat 
in the past but the authorization had run out 
moscow has 910200 tons of wheat still available under the may 2 
subsidy announcement goldthwait said 
he said the latest sales by seven exporting companies call for 
shipment in the first half of june the subsidies average 889 per 
ton or about 24 cents per bushel of wheat the total for the 
300000 tons would be about 27 million 
the soviet union had bought more than 4 million tons of us 
wheat for 198889 delivery at prices subsidized under the 
departments export enhancement program or eep 
the latest sales pushed total corn and wheat sales to the soviet 
union for delivery this year under terms of the longterm supply 
agreement between the two countries to a record of more than 20 
million tons surpassing the old mark of 186 million tons shipped 
to the soviets in 198485 
corn which is not subsidized makes up more than 156 million 
tons of the current total with wheat at 46 million tons in 
addition the soviets have bought 443000 tons of soybeans 137 
million tons of soybean meal and 807400 tons of grain sorghums 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 300000 tons of 
wheat would be about 11 million bushels 
wheat prices have been averaging about 4 per bushel at the farm 
level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning that 
the latest sale could have a farm value of around 44 million 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
goldthwait said the new subsidized wheat sales were handled by 
continental grain co 95000 tons garnac grain co 20000 
peavey co 60000 harvest states cooperatives 25000 tradigrain 
inc 50000 louis dreyfus corp 25000 and bunge corp 25000

the air force on friday delayed the 
liftoff of a military navigation satellite because electrical 
repairs at the launch pad will take longer than officials expected 
june 5 is the earliest the 65 million navstar global 
positioning satellite can be launched atop its delta 2 rocket 
booster said capt ken warren an air force spokesman 
it will be the fifth launch attempt the delta 2navstar was to 
have flown may 20 but bad weather forced three postponements a 
fourth launch attempt was aborted wednesday because of a wiring 
problem at the launch pad 
officials had predicted the circuit would be repaired in time 
for a launch may 31 but technicians working at the pad on friday 
found several aging electrical components that need to be replaced 
the components were due to expire soon so rather than risk a 
problem with them later they decided to change them out warren 
explained 
wednesdays scheduled launch was aborted at the last second when 
a computer shut down the delta 2s main engine before it could 
fire experts investigating the incident discovered an electrical 
problem that blocked the path of an ignition command sent by launch 
controllers to an engine valve the valve did not open and starved 
the engine of fuel

police questioned witnesses friday who 
saw a yellow vehicle speed away after two young american 
missionaries were cut down by machinegun fire a guerrilla group 
has claimed responsibility 
the bodies of todd ray wilson and jeffrey brent ball both 
20yearold mormons from utah were taken to the la paz airport for 
return to the united states wilsons hometown was wellington and 
ball was from coalville 
they were killed as they returned home wednesday night 
a statement distributed to la paz newspapers claimed 
responsibility on behalf of the zarate willka armed liberation 
front 
it said in part the violation of our sovereignty cannot go 
unpunished the yankee invaders who come to massacre our fellow 
farmers are warned as are their local slaves we the poor have no 
other road than to rise up in arms our hatred is implacable and 
our war is to the death 
zarate willka was a 19th century indian revolutionary in bolivia 
the group using his name also claimed responsibility for a bomb 
that exploded in august near a motorcade carrying george p shultz 
then secretary of state several vehicles were damaged but no 
injuries were reported 
interior minister eduardo perez beltran said the group does 
not have a political affilitation and one cannot therefore speak of 
the existence of guerillas in the country we are facing something 
that could also come from the cocaine trade 
us embassy officials who are cooperating in the 
investigation say the responsibility is not yet clear 
the two missionaries of the church of latter day saints lived 
near a mormon church that was seriously damaged by a bomb in 1988 
they arrived a year ago and were working in the villa victoria 
neighborhood near downtown la paz 
about 400 mormon missionaries are assigned to bolivia church 
officials said 
american officials said security had been strengthened for the 
embassy and its personnel they said it this was the first case of 
us citizens being killed by a terrorist or guerrilla group in

the bush administration is considering a 
policy change that could halve the admissions of soviet refugees to 
the united states a jewish community official said friday 
the proposed limitation is one of several options under review 
in an attempt to cope with an unprecedented flow of soviets most 
of them jews being allowed to leave under the glasnost policies of 
mikhail gorbachev 
if implemented the new policy could be a boon for israel which 
accepts every soviet jew who can get out in recent years about 90 
percent of soviet jews have opted to come to the united states 
rather than israel said david harris of the american jewish 
committee 
israel facing a slump in jewish immigration and a surge in the 
birthrate among its arab minority has been pushing for years to 
get more soviet jews 
the state department had no immediate comment on the matter 
saying only that various options were under review for dealing with 
the influx of soviet emigres 
jewish groups and the justice department estimate that as many 
as 75000 soviets will be granted exit visas this year about 
55000 of them jews and the rest pentecostalists and armenians 
about 18000 soviets have left the soviet union so far this 
year and another 26000 applicants are waiting to be interviewed 
at the us embassy the vast majority of soviet emigres are 
awarded refugee status by the united states which means their way 
here and resettlement is paid by the government 
next year the numbers are expected to increase further 
presenting the budgetstrapped administration with a severe problem 
the bush administration which only budgeted for some 22500 
soviet refugees for fiscal 1989 has asked congress to fund an 
additional 22500 soviet refugees this fiscal year the white house 
has also asked for an emergency allocation of 100 million to deal 
with the influx 
in addition attorney general dick thornburgh has proposed 
legislation that would allow 30000 admissions of soviets annually 
although not as refugees other categories of admissions such as 
immigrants are not eligible for full federal funding 
under the proposed change soviet applicants would no longer be 
eligible for refugee status unless they have relatives in the 
united states or a close affiliation with the united states through 
education or other ties said harris whose organization lobbies 
for soviet jews 
existing policy allows admission of soviets as refugees under a 
category of national interest in other words because us 
foreign policy interests seek to encourage the kremlin to allow 
freer emigration 
removing soviets from that eligibility would bring their 
treatment in line with that of other refugee groups like hispanics 
and asians harris said 
an attempt to curb the number of soviet refugees through a 
policy directive from former attorney general edwin meese last 
summer failed when us lawmakers and jewish groups protested 
meese directed that soviet jews would no longer be automatically 
granted refugee status on an assumption that they all suffered 
religious persecution and instead would be dealt with on a 
casebycase basis 
the immigration and naturalization service began implementing 
the change and as many as 70 percent of refugee applicants were 
rejected but as a result of pressure from congress refugee 
acceptance has gone up to about 80 percent for soviet jews harris 
said

the new congress of peoples deputies nominated a 
handful of radicals friday to serve in its working legislature 
opening the lawmaking process to broader participation after 
decades of kremlin monopoly 
but some progressives charged that communist party bureaucrats 
had rigged the process to stay in power and others accused the 
radicals of undermining the course of political reform 
with lithuanians announcing at one point they would boycott 
elections to choose the membership of the new legislature the 
supreme soviet president mikhail s gorbachev declared the 
congress of peoples deputies in a crisis situation on only the 
second day of its existence 
the 2250member parliament was choosing members to fill its 
542seat working legislature called the supreme soviet 
candidates originally were selected in local caucuses but they 
had to be nominated by the congress before they could stand for 
election most delegations nominated only one candidate for each 
seat they were alloted but a few offered more it is in those 
districts where there are real races candidates who get the 
highest number of votes and more than 50 percent are elected 
the final number of deputies nominated friday was around 
600 according to one official who addressed the congress 
the deputies wrangled for hours over the nominations as members 
bickered about procedure and traded accusations of obstructionism 
the debate got sidetracked by a heated squabble over police 
attempts to break up a street meeting called to discuss the first 
day of parliamentary debate 
voting finally began 12 hours after the congress convened with 
weary deputies filing out of the hall to cast ballots results were 
expected when the congress meets again saturday morning 
populist boris n yeltsin was on the list of 573 congress 
members selected by their home regions to serve in the supreme 
soviet which took its name from the old rubberstamp parliament 
the procedure set up tough races for lawmakers from moscow where 
some of the bestknown progressives are running 
the party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the 
supreme soviet according to the old system complained deputy 
vladimir shevlyuga of rostovondon 
vladimir zolotukhin of uzbekistan complained the top party and 
government officials in his central asian republic had nominated 
themselves as in the past 
nevertheless the candidates list showed that the new supreme 
soviet will have a far different makeup from the old one which met 
for only a few days a year to unanimously approve any bill put 
before it and vigorously applaud the speeches of top kremlin 
officials 
only one member of the ruling party politburo russian 
federation president vitaly i vorotnikov is on the list of 
candidates 
nominations were closed for most republics assuring the 
election of a small group of progressives including estonian marju 
lauristin and lithuanian kazimir motieka popular front leaders who 
led fights to declare their republics sovereign 
live coverage by staterun tv continued to show soviets the 
novel spectacle of their representatives openly airing 
disagreements and many viewers were riveted to their sets despite 
the snails pace of parliamentary action 
the lithuanians announced through vytautas landsbergis chairman 
of the grassroots reform group sajudis that they would boycott the 
elections if deputies from other republics were allowed to vote on 
which lithuanians should serve in the supreme soviet 
landsbergis also said parliamentarians from his tiny homeland on 
the baltic sea did not want to cast ballots to elect people to the 
supreme soviet from other regions of this vast country 
we cant elect people who are not known to us he said 
its not right to vote in the darkness 
roy medvedev a moscowbased historian whose exposes of josef 
stalins bloody abuses of power were once banned in his native 
country appealed for reconsideration of the boycott threat 
i ask the comrades from lithuania not to break the huge 
amount of work done in our society to democratize it medvedev 
said a giant statue of soviet founder vladimir i lenin at his 
back 
gorbachev who chaired the meeting said the lithuanian boycott 
sparked a crisis situation in the fledgling parliament but 
after murky debate and a series of recesses the body moved toward 
a secret ballot on the legislative candidates 
the exchange demonstrated the competing interests even among 
soviet progressives the lithuanians and their baltic neighbors 
want to protect their small reform slates from being voted down in 
an allcongress vote they fear conservatives from the giant 
russian federation the ukraine or central asia could reject 
reformminded candidates from the baltics 
however moscow deputies many of whom are national celebrities 
insisted on presenting a slate of 55 candidates for the 29 seats 
allocated to them to underline the principle of contested elections 
on the moscow slate are some of the nations bestknown 
progressives including medvedev economist gavril popov academic 
sergei stankevich yuri chernichenko an agriculture reform 
advocate and ilya zaslavskaya an advocate for the handicapped 
stankevich said reformers had gone into fridays session seeking 
a rule to bar regional communist party bosses from retaining their 
jobs and the clout and perquisites they provide while serving 
simultaneously in the supreme soviet 
but when gorbachev put the proposal to a vote only 636 deputies 
voted to relieve lawmakers of their previous jobs although a 
majority said members should not have to perform other duties 
during legislative sessions which are expected to last about eight 
months of the year

in a break with kremlin leaders traditional 
isolation premier nikolai i ryzhkov waded into a crowd of 
reporters and parliamentarians outside the congress on friday 
it was the second night in a row such a thing had happened on 
thursday defense minister dmitri t yazov traded world war ii 
stories with deputies and politburo member vadim a medvedev 
chatted with foreign reporters 
ryzhkov is no 2 man in the soviet government 
after he genially answered questions on everything from housing 
loans to private filmmaking in the dusk of a northern summer 
security men built like boxers lectured soviet reporters for 
snagging the boss for a second round of questioning before the 
premier strode off under the kremlins blooming chestnuts and 
lilacs 
hey were journalists its our job said mikhail sokorov 
a local newspaper reporter 
the security men had little to fear however as all the 
deputies and news media people had passed a gauntlet of guards to 
enter the brickwalled fortress in the center of moscow during the 
congress 
still it was a thrill for the mass of newly elected deputies 
from ordinary walks of life to find their previously remote leaders 
within touching distance at least 50 crowded around ryzhkov friday 
night until the pack became so thick it was impossible to identify 
the attraction in the middle 
ryzhkovs appearances carried a slight air of campaigning since 
he faces the congress in his first election test possibly on 
saturday the political reform that created the congress also gave 
it the power to confirm the premier and he has come under fire 
from a few deputies in the past week for his work on the economy 
and the environment 
my soul hurts when i think about pensions ryzhkov said 
friday in response to a question about a deputys demand for 
increases in payments as low as 36 a month to retirees 
he says we must find the money but how 
ryzhkov said he is convinced that individual plots and the 
construction of individual houses must be permitted to solve a 
housing crunch but left moscow out of that possibility without 
explaining 
development of the soviet space shuttle led to creation of 100 
new industrial materials he boasted but dragging those ideas into 
the domestic economy is proving far harder 
we should create such economic conditions that people chase 
after them he said 
private cooperatives may be controversial but theyre an 
explosive success in the governments economic reform program he 
said in the 2 years since the small businesses were legalized 
100000 have cropped up they contributed about 675 billion to 
the economy in just the first three months of this year he said

students camped out in beijings central square 
tried to gauge the shifting political winds friday but said their 
protest would continue no matter who runs the country 
communist party chief zhao ziyang the leader most sympathetic 
to the demonstrators demands was reported to have been ousted and 
placed under house arrest in a power struggle with premier li peng 
the number of students in tiananmen square had dwindled to about 
15000 but student leaders said they were undeterred by the 
apparent ascendancy of li who has taken a much harder line with 
the demonstrators 
its going to get more complex said a student leader from 
qinghua university who would only give his name as xin we cant 
ascertain what the leaders intentions are but we will not leave 
the square 
chinese sources say zhao has been stripped of all powers and 
that li is in charge of party and government functons 
zhao ziyang was relatively openminded xin said atop the 
peoples heroes monument in tiananmen square where the student 
leaders have set up their headquarters we dont feel that he was 
the savior of all china but he was more capable than li peng 
the students who began their protests april 15 by seeking talks 
with the government on social reforms and profiteering by 
bureaucrats are demanding lis resignation 
zhaos apparent ouster has not weakened the students resolve to 
stay in the square until li resigns because everybody in the 
country is watching the square xin said if we leave we will 
betray their hopes 
students are not losing hope just because zhao is sacked 
said a beijing medical student our belief is firm and cannot be 
moved 
ren ju a senior at the central nationalities institute said 
students preferred zhao over li 
we didnt really like zhao ziyang before all this started but 
after the hunger fast he came to visit the strikers on the square 
and said he would work to eradicate corruption starting with his 
own children ren said 
his removal will not deter students from their sitin ren said 
guo weiming a senior at xian transportation college said we 
dont feel simply that zhao should replace li guo said im 
not convinced he could represent the peoples interests 
zhao reportedly angered party conservatives with an impassioned 
speech to a group of hunger strikers in tiananmen last week as 
well as a detailed explanation to visiting soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev last week of a secret 1987 meeting confirming senior 
leader deng xiaopings paramount power 
last month he also called the student movement patriotic 
rather than lis favored description disturbances 
not all students were convinced zhao was truly out i think 
theres some kind of intrigue going on where were deliberately 
being sent the wrong signals said a sophomore at tianjin 
institute of light industry named liang 
maybe word of zhaos dismissal was deliberately leaked so 
people would rally around him liang said then if he actually 
came into power he would be in a better position to control the 
masses

glen ridge high school welcomed a 
scheduled holiday friday but the baseball team took the field 
without its captain a reminder of the upheaval over the arrests of 
five students on sexual assault charges 
law enforcement officials meanwhile would not comment on a 
newspaper report friday that the students charged in the march 1 
incident asked another student to videotape them having sex with 
the mentally retarded girl on another occasion 
the student charles figueroa a football teammate of some of 
the boys charged told the new york post he refused to make the 
tape and eventually informed authorities about the incident there 
was no answer friday in repeated attempts to call figueroa 
glen ridge superintendent of schools rose mccaffrey said 
figueroas comments are suspect charlie has a knack of 
fantasizing and takes off and starts discussing things ms 
mccaffrey said 
im not saying this is not true at all she said because 
of the statements he made we immediately notified police 
ms mccaffrey said figueroa told a teacher what the other 
students had told him about the sexual assault and was kept out of 
school for several days on the request of his mother mary who 
feared retaliation from students 
ray weiss a spokesman for the essex county prosecutors office 
would not comment on the report but said we are pursuing all 
angles of the investigation 
there was no indication a second episode took place 
the five students were arrested wednesday and charged with 
sexually assaulting a 17yearold girl with a broomstick and 
miniature baseball bat eight other male teens cheered the attack 
without intervening investigators said 
two of those charged twin brothers kyle and kevin scherzer are 
captains of the football team and kyle is captain of the baseball 
team which played a game without him friday 
all five have been suspended from school for 10 days 
the student body is divided but this is i guess to be 
expected said ms mccaffrey there are feelings of friendship 
and antagonism 
some students friendly with those charged said the young woman 
who has since turned 18 willingly participated in the incident 
friends of the young woman said she did not fully understand what 
was happening 
officials have said she attends special education classes but 
have not elaborated on the extent of her mental impairment 
attorneys for some of the boys charged friday criticized the 
media attention and the prosecutors handling of the case 
i think its awful because first of all whether youre a 
parent victim or alleged defendant its a tragedy and there is a 
presumption of innocence said donald w merkelbach attorney for 
the scherzers 
i understand the medias job but i think they have infringed 
upon the presumption of innocence

a mass grave discovered near the capital 
last month contains the remains of more than 600 men women and 
children buried between 1944 and 1947 by soviet and polish secret 
police official and independent reports said thursday 
the bodies appear to include both german pows and polish 
resistance fighters who were arrested by the soviet secret police 
after the war according to gazeta wyborcza an independent 
solidarity newspaper and the officially published daily express 
wieczorny 
the investigation comes during increasing efforts backed by the 
communist government to acknowledge repressions of the postwar 
years 
the chairman of the council for preserving the memory of 
struggle and martyrdom gen roman paszkowski told the state pap 
news agency thursday that searches were in progress for graves of 
polish officers and other victims of reprisals of the stalinist 
period 
an unknown number of poles many of whom fought with the 
underground home army against the nazi occupiers during world war 
ii were executed by soviet secret police after the war 
the home army remained loyal to the polish governmentinexile 
during the war and the soviets considered its officers suspect 
when communists came to power in poland after 1944 some were 
believed to have been executed in secret and others were deported 
to siberian prisons 
we will do our best to commemorate events places and figures 
in our history in tune with historical truth paszkowski said 
in otwock the bodies were found piled in five layers after a 
journalist decided to follow up on rumors circulating in the area 
when bones and skulls were unearthed the mayor named a priest and 
two representatives of the independent solidarity movement to an 
investigatory commission 
the commission examined about 400 bodies and found 50 percent 
had some signs of postmortem dissection none had been victims of 
shooting according to pap 
the bodies were unclothed and no objects that could lead to 
identification have been found in the grave which is in a wooded 
area gazeta wyborcza said 
longtime residents told investigators about seeing the burial of 
bodies of german pows who died of disease and starvation at a 
soviet prison camp in the town the newspaper said the german 
prisoners were pitifully thin and would plead through a fence for 
scraps of bread residents recalled 
one witness recounted being told to bury his wife a polish home 
army officer arrested on charges of antisoviet activities by the 
polish secret police she died at the soviet prison hospital in 
otwock in 1947 he said 
maria grzeskowiak interviewed in express wieczorny said she 
was a nurse at the hospital and tended to dying german pows and 
home army prisoners whose bodies were taken to be buried

us rep donald lukens was convicted 
friday of having sex with a 16yearold girl whose mother accused 
the congressman of offering a government job to buy her silence 
hours after the verdict one ohio congressman called for lukens 
resignation but an aide predicted he would seek reelection next 
year 
i think he should do the gentlemanly thing and resign said 
rep chalmers wylie the senior republican among ohios 
congressional delegation lukens also is a republican 
a jury deliberated for 1 hours before finding lukens guilty of 
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor stemming 
from an incident last nov 6 the misdemeanor carries a maximum 
sentence of 180 days in jail and a 1000 fine 
lukens stood still his hands pressed on the defense table and 
his mouth slightly open as franklin county domestic relations 
judge ronald solove read the verdict 
the 58yearold divorced congressman from middletown was 
indicted feb 23 about three weeks after columbus television 
station wsyx broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that appeared 
to show lukens offering to find the girls mother anna coffman a 
job she had gone to the station to get help and agreed to the 
secret taping 
on the tape the woman asked lukens why he was messing 
around with her daughter rosie lukens replied well first of 
all i didnt really know she was a teenager 
toward the end of the tape lukens said let me go back to 
washington and see what there is parttime and inaudible 
i dont know what uh the government has but i can check and 
find out 
mrs coffman testified that the offer was to try to buy her 
silence while lukens called it an extortion attempt 
rosie coffman told reporters she was pleased with the verdict 
im happy to see justice is done she said asked if she 
hated lukens said said no i dont hate him i dont hate 
anybody 
a misdemeanor conviction does not automatically trigger an 
ethics committee investigation or bar a member from sitting in 
congress the committee does have the option of investigating such 
cases and recommending action such as censure 
solove delayed sentencing pending the completion of a 
presentence investigation 
lukens declined to comment on the verdict before he left the 
courthouse through a private hallway and elevator his chief of 
staff william jarrell said he planned to make a statement next 
week about his personal and political future 
the congressman will be spending some quiet time speaking to 
family and friends to get a lot of opinion and advice jarrell 
said but ill say this we will be running 
lukens was first elected to the house in 1966 serving two terms 
before dropping out to make an unsuccessful bid for the ohio 
governorship after serving terms in the state house of 
representatives he returned to the us house in 1987 
lukens attorney thomas tyack said lukens would appeal on the 
grounds that evidence about the girls background was not presented 
to the jury 
the primary grounds will be the exclusion of ms coffmans 
juvenile record children services file and school records which 
were critical to our case he said i also found evidence of 
reverse discrimination which may be cited in the appeal the 
girl is black and lukens is white 
neither the girl nor her mother was in the courtroom when the 
verdict was read 
assistant prosecutor rita mangini said lukens contributed to the 
girls unruliness and delinquency by giving her alcohol paying for 
her cab ride to his apartment and having sex with her because he 
knew she was underage 
during the grand jury investigation the franklin county 
prosecutor sought an additional indictment stemming from an alleged 
sexual encounter between lukens and the girl in 1985 when she was 
13 the grand jury determined there was insufficient evidence 
because of conflicting testimony from the girl

a minnesota political era ended friday when 
former vice president walter f mondale said he will not challenge 
republican us sen rudy boschwitz in 1990 or seek any other 
elective office in the future 
i believe its time for other candidates to step forward 
said mondale a former senator who was the democratic partys 
presidential nominee in 1984 it was a very difficult choice for 
us 
mondale and his mentor the late hubert h humphrey dominated 
minnesota politics from 1948 when humphrey was elected to the us 
senate to 1980 when the cartermondale ticket lost the 
presidential race both mondale and humphrey who died in 1978 
represented minnesota in the senate served as vice president and 
were unsuccessful democratic presidential nominees 
a lot of the people i worked for have been dead for a long 
time and at some point even mondale has to get out said 
mondale 61 one of the requirements of a healthy party is that 
it renews itself you cant keep running walter mondale for 
everything 
mondale said he and his wife joan have enjoyed his life out of 
political office and has seen too many colleagues remain in the 
senate for too long 
im at peace with myself mondale said we took a lot of

leave britain for the same reason

speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom its clearly 
in retaliation he added and the government will consider what 
our response will be 
after britain ordered the czechslovaks to leave the communist 
party daily rude pravo said it was another case of british 
spymania which certain british circles bring about from time to 
time 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons on 
thursday the expulsions of the czechoslovaks and of 11 soviets a 
week ago were necessary regardless of the effect upon our 
relations 
britain had enjoyed its best relations with the soviet union 
since world war ii before the exchange last week and relations 
with czechoslovakia were improving 
sir john fretwell foreign office political director said 
czechoslovakia ignored warnings about in its diplomats given last 
september when three others were expelled 
the exchange with moscow began may 19 when britain ordered eight 
soviet diplomats and three journalists out moscow retaliated a day 
later with expulsions of like number and kind 
britain and the soviets now are discussing kremlin demands that 
britain reduce to 205 the number of britons and local employees in 
the soviet union moscow says that matches the number of soviets 
allowed in britain 
director general leonid kravchenko head of the soviet news 
agency tass protested in a letter to foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe on friday over the expulsion of londonbased tass 
correspondent igor peskov 
kravchenko said peskov 35 was a man of impeccable honesty 
and had done nothing to contravene british or international law 
british newspaper reports quoting government sources in london 
said peskov headed a spy ring offering bribes in return for 
industrial secrets peskov denied it britain disclosed no specific 
reason for the expulsions 
howe said in birmingham friday that britain will continue to 
take a tough line to defend national security

the race between el paso mayoral 
candidates suzie azar and ed elsey which once turned on issues 
such as economic development and crime became personal as 
saturdays runoff neared 
the two city council members achieved a runoff by defeating four 
other mayoral candidates in the general election may 6 
mrs azar outpolled elsey 31 percent to 23 percent but elsey 
since has refused to make a public appearance with mrs azar until 
she reveals how much her family makes from businesses on property 
they lease from the city near the el paso international airport 
elsey says mrs azar could face a conflict of interest in votes 
on airport matters 
under elseys prodding mrs azar issued a statement saying she 
and her husband had a net worth of about 37 million but she has 
not revealed how much she and her husband earn from property near 
the airport calling elseys questions a smoke screen 
elsey owner of a medical supply business lists his net worth 
at 378875 
since elsey brought up the income topic two weeks ago both 
candidates have ignored issues such as what kinds of businesses to 
attract how to reduce crime whether to raise taxes and how to 
deal with rapid population growth 
both newspapers have endorsed mrs azar a democrat while 
outgoing mayor jonathan rogers supports elsey by law rogers had 
to step down this time after four consecutive twoyear terms 
if mrs azar wins el paso will become the fourth of texas five 
largest cities to elect a woman mayor houston dallas and san 
antonio are all led by women 
unlike most major texas cities el paso has a strong mayor and 
no city manager the mayor appoints members of city boards and 
supervises department heads and thus holds the most powerful 
position in city government

the uss iowa sailor linked to investigation of the 
massive explosion aboard the battleship friday denied wrongdoing 
and charged the navy was seeking a scapegoat 
kendall truitt 21yearold gunners mate 3rd class got 
highprofile miami attorney ellis rubin to represent him rubin 
warned that continued allegations against truitt from 
homosexuality to that he intentionally caused the explosion that 
killed 47 sailors april 19 would be answered in court 
truitt and clayton hartwig 25yearold gunners mate who died 
in the gun turret blast were best friends and took out 100000 
life insurance policies naming each other as the beneficiaries 
navy investigators have said they are looking into the 
relationship including a reported fallingout last year when 
truitt was married as they study homicide as a possibility in the 
case 
i think the navy is at a loss truitt said theyre just 
looking for a scapegoat 
rubin said navy intelligence had leaked the charges to the 
press little by little to create what he called a media 
frenzy 
he said truitt had come to south florida seeking counsel and 
advice in connection with these vicious untrue false and 
malicious rumors leaked by the intelligence service of the navy and 
transmitted to favored elements of the media 
they have no evidence he said they dont even have 
probable cause 
rubin said truitt risked his life to save other sailors after 
the explosion 
truitt and wife carole joined rubin outside the attorneys law 
offices for a news conference in which truitt denied allegations 
against him rubin asked if he were a homosexual which truitt 
denied and then asked truitts wife if he were a good lover she 
replied affirmatively 
in a later interview on the nbctv network news truitt said he 
and hartwig never had a complete fallingout and the two had 
talked several days before the fatal cruise 
he was very excited about his new orders to work as a driver 
at the us embassy in london truitt said 
thursday the navy said truitt was being transferred to the 
staff commander of destroyer squadron eight in mayport because of 
the extensive publicity surrounding the iowa explosion 
the new york times reported thursday that unidentified pentagon 
sources said they found no physical evidence indicating the blast 
was caused by a zmechanical or electrical failure or any other 
material problem 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said improper storage of the 
powder had been ruled out as a cause 
but rubin said the powder used in the turret where the blast 
occurred was stored on barges where temperatures reached the 90s 
and were 25 degrees higher inside the barge 
anyone familiar with gunpowder knows it becomes unstable when 
it gets over 100 degrees he said 
nbc reported that unidentified sources said the navy is 
investigating the possibility that a detonating device was hidden 
in a burlap patch inserted between bags of powder to clean the 
barrels of the ships guns 
deborah johnson a naval investigative service agent in norfolk 
va said a search of truitts home following the april 19 blast 
produced one of the burlap patches adding that it was not tampered 
with 
at fridays news conference truitt said his home had not been 
searched 
rubin said he wanted access to the navy investigation and wanted 
to go aboard the uss iowa he said he was a former navy commander 
and is familiar with gun turret operations as well as with navy 
legal procedures rubin said he was certain there would be no 
courtmartial against truitt

lawyers debated in federal court friday whether a 
plan to let parents choose their childrens schools would reverse 
years of efforts to integrate bostons classrooms 
supporters say the plan scheduled to take effect this fall for 
kindergarten first and sixthgrade students would foster 
competition among schools and improve teaching 
but a lawyer representing students in a desegregation case 
dating to 1972 argued that the plan would bring a substantial 
resegregation of the citys public schools after 15 years of busing 
for integration 
the lawyer thomas atkins said the plan has merit but needs 
adjusting the proposed plan would allow parents to choose their 
childrens schools within three geographical zones provided rough 
racial balance is maintained 
this approach holds great promise in this school district 
he said but he added we believe the very promise the plan 
represents cautions against a premature poorly planned start 
putting the plan into effect in september would have an 
adverse impact on the students in this school system white ones 
black ones and other ones atkins said 
attorney henry dinger representing the school committee argued 
that the assignment plan was a logical extension of desegregation 
technology employed by the courts in this case 
judge w arthur garrity listened to the lawyers arguments and 
continued the hearing until tuesday morning after testimony from 
school committee member juanita wade and school superintendent 
laval s wilson 
garrity presided over the courtordered desegregation of 
bostons schools in the 1970s when the city was convulsed by 
protests that sometimes turned violent 
garrity expressed doubt about some of the language of the plan 
prompting wilson to say he would support any modifications 
necessary to prevent misinterpretations 
i will clearly make sure there is no resegregation i dont 
think theres any way this could occur wilson said 
the school superintendent added that 73 percent of the 
applications from parents for particular schools had been received 
and it would be exceedingly disruptive to cancel all those 
assignments 
but garrity said the small percentage of white students in city 
schools about onequarter of the 57000 total according to 
committee member wade was a subject of concern 
unless clear care is taken here it would be very easy to have 
a product where every white pupil is in a neighborhood school and 
unless those black children would take a bus the number of 
racially isolated schools in the city would increase 
dramatically garrity said 
caroline playther a plaintiff intervener on the behalf of 
hispanic parents also contended that the school assignment plan 
would adversely affect hispanic students 
dinger said some students might not be able to attend schools of 
their choice under the plan but it would ensure a racially diverse 
student body in every school give parents greater control over 
their childrens educations and improve educational quality 
the plaintiff has submitted no evidence to say the result 
would be segregation he said 
wade testified that she supported the plan despite having 
questions about the schedule for putting it into effect

the coming week could be critical in easterns 2monthold 
chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and how it emerges from one of the 
most contentious labor disputes in the commercial airline business 
the committee representing the airlines major creditors is 
expected to meet during the week and a hearing is scheduled for 
thursday in federal bankruptcy court on the issue of appointing a 
special trustee to run eastern 
next week could be a very significant decision point 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said friday from the airlines miami 
headquarters 
two investor groups had submitted formal buyout proposals for 
eastern before us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland approved the 
365 million shuttle sale to trump on thursday 
the groups one headed by former piedmont airlines chairman 
william howard and the other by chicago commodities trader joseph 
ritchie are expected to present new financing plans in the coming 
week for eastern minus the shuttle union representatives say 
even before the shuttle sale david i shapiro courtappointed 
examiner for eastern had said the howard and ritchie groups would 
have to put up more cash in their purchase proposals 
discussions between the investor groups and union 
representatives were planned for the memorial day holiday weekend 
the unions goal is for eastern to be sold to a new owner and 
resume operations by july 1 said dan ashby a spokesman for the 
eastern pilots union 
eastern sought bankruptcy court refuge march 9 five days after 
the start of a strike that grounded most of its flights 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
plans to rebuild eastern as a smaller carrier and sell another 14 
billion worth of eastern assets besides the shuttle 
the bankruptcy court which must sanction any plan has not 
passed judgment on lorenzos strategy although eastern has been 
making deals for the sale of aircraft landing slots and other 
assets in the event the plan is approved 
at its meeting the creditors committee is expected to evaluate 
lorenzos plan and possibly the revised howard and ritchie 
proposals sources close to the situation said 
on thursday lifland is scheduled to hear arguments on the 
unions request that a powerful trustee be appointed to run 
eastern which would remove the airline from lorenzos control the

miamitown about seven miles east of cincinnati authorities said 
witnesses gave varying accounts of two to four vehicles falling 
into the river said bruce smith chief of the colerain township 
fire department 
radio station wcky reported at least six people were missing an 
adult and four children were seen in a yellow pickup truck and at 
least one person in a car which went under the water wcky reported 
hamilton county sheriffs lt col ramon hoffbauer when asked 
if anyone could have survived a plunge into the river said i 
wouldnt think so 
the current is moving pretty fast i cant tell you how fast 
but the rescue crews didnt go into the water at all hoffbauer 
said 
a 100foot section of the center of the onelane bridge fell 
about 10 feet into the river at 527 pm smith said the bridge 
was about 300 feet long 
tires tree tops and barrels could be seen floating in the 
river but no vehicles were sighted and they were presumed to have 
floated downstream smith said 
the river was at 19 feet three feet above flood stage and was 
expected to crest at 23 feet saturday morning said gary miller 
director of disaster services for the cincinnati chapter of the 
american red cross 
the red cross heard from several people who said relatives had 
not arrived home on schedule friday night he said 
the temporary bridge built to carry traffic on us 52 during 
construction of a permanent span collapsed when wooden supports 
that held the roadway deck failed said hamilton county engineer 
donald schramm 
schramm said the contractor that built the bridge called the 
engineers office about 10 minutes before the collapse and 
suggested closing the span because of debris in the water 
schramm said an order was issued immediately but the collapse 
occurred before barricades could be set up 
ron wells said he crossed the bridge just before it collapsed 
i turned around and looked i saw the back of a car going in 
a couple more sections of the bridge fell after that he said 
the flooding in camden was caused when a twohour downpour 
pushed the sevenmile creek beyond its banks and into lowlying 
areas 
it was scary said assistant fire chief dave steele to 
some individuals they have lost everything we do have trailers 
that have been washed off their foundations 
he said water was 5 feet deep in some houses 
firefighter joseph ball said he and others rescued about 30 
people in a trailer park near the creek by trying rope from the 
trailers to trees evacuees clung to the rope as they waded through 
the floodwaters to boats 
chuck weinstiger one of the people rescued from the trailer 
park said the water was chestdeep as he made his way to safety 
with the rope a firefighter carried his 1yearold daughter in his 
jacket 
its kind of scary when you have a baby weinstiger said 
another resident charlie spencer said he carried an elderly 
woman from her house he said he chained his car to a tree to keep 
it from floating away 
six families were flooded out of their homes in butler county 
also in southwestern ohio said sheriffs dispatcher diana dunn 
the butler evacuees stayed with friends and relatives ms dunn 
said most of the camden evacuees were sent to an elementary 
school but all had left by late morning when floodwaters began to 
recede

including gov booth gardner and republican friends such as sens 
slade gorton of washington and ted stevens of alaska

former rep pat swindall negotiated for a month 
or more to borrow what he thought was drug money and later lied 
about it to a federal grand jury a prosecutor said thursday 
assistant us attorney craig gillen said during opening 
arguments in swindalls perjury trial that videotapes and other 
evidence will show that swindall seeking an 850000 loan was 
told the deal violated banking laws was told narcotics money was 
involved and was urged to walk away by the undercover agent but 
never terminated the deal 
swindalls attorneys argued that swindall and the government 
were both duped by a manipulative associate of the former 
republican congressman 
swindall is accused of lying under oath in early 1988 to a 
federal grand jury investigating his dealings with charles 
lechasney an associate and convicted money launderer and with 
federal agent mike mullaney who was posing as mike martinez a 
money broker for probable drug dealers 
gillen told jurors that the agent more than once told swindall 
that if he were troubled by the illegal nature of the proposed deal 
he could walk away the agent is almost beating him off with a 
stick the prosecutor said 
still swindall sought the money and even turned over to his 
contractor a check for 150000 before later canceling the loan 
deal gillen said 
swindall did not give a damn where the money came from 
gillen said 
in his opening argument defense attorney richard hendrix said 
lechasney tried to fool swindall into believing the deal was 
legitimate 
hendrix said lechasney repeatedly told swindall that the deal 
involved legitimate money coming from foreign investors while he 
told mullaney that swindall was a crook 
mullaney the first witness called by the prosecution thursday 
afternoon testified that lechasney told him that the congressman 
didnt care where the money came from he wanted at least 
750000 
mullaney also said he was interested in meeting swindall to 
investigate whether swindalls plans to sell a 1 million note at a 
discount for cash would lead to an evasion of his income taxes 
and violations of currency laws 
hendrix however told the jury that swindall never agreed to 
the deal that he continued to shop for and ultimately acquired 
other financing for his luxurious suburban home in stone mountain 
and that the check he received from lechasney was a separate 
transaction he canceled after becoming suspicious 
swindall was indicted oct 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal 
grand jury each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five 
years in prison 
the twoterm congressman lost his 4th district seat in atlantas 
eastern suburbs to democrat ben jones last november an attempt at 
a speedy trial before election day was aborted after two jurors 
received swindall campaign material in the mail

rain that fell thursday in southern florida missed 
a grass fire that has burned 81100 acres of everglades national 
park and more flareups were reported dashing firefighters hopes 
they could confine the blaze 
the southwest corner is giving us problems this evening 
said park spokeswoman pat tolle there was rain and a little bit 
of hail but also lightning 
about 250 firefighters from as far away as california have 
fought the blaze which was started by lightning may 16 in the 
regions worst fire season in a decade she said about 60 
firefighters returned to fire lines thursday to tend hot spots and 
secure fire lines 
officials earlier predicted the fire would move toward a sparse 
area with poor fuel and had not expected any lightning 
the direction its going is very sparse and poor fuel and 
its also wetter in that area so were very optimistic were just 
going to be able to put a circle around it ms tolle said 
while showers fell 30 miles to the northeast in the miami area 
no rain fell on the fire which is located in marshy sawgrass and 
isolated hardwood hammocks that hadnt burned in more than 30 years 
the blaze is typical of fires before the rainy season in the 
vast park and has caused only limited damage ms tolle said 
its burning off the top of the grass she said well 
see as soon as the summer rains begin therell be a lush regrowth 
of the sawgrass 
the fire briefly threatened the miccosukee indian village at the 
northern edge of the park tuesday before shifting direction but 
the parks nearby shark valley visitor center was closed until 
thursday morning because of heavy smoke 
state officials estimate about 400 wildfires have consumed 
350000 acres of grass and brush in south florida since october 
probably as far as acreage lost this will end up topping the 
others in this decade said david utley state forestry division 
district administrator he estimated twothirds of the fires have 
been caused by man

mondale aides would not disclose whether the former senator from 
minnesota and 1984 democratic presidential nominee will indicate 
whether he plans to seek the seat now held by republican rudy 
boschwitz 
the 715 am news conference will have something to do with 
the us senate race said ted mondale it will be worth 
covering 
mondale a protege of the late hubert h humphrey generally is 
considered the most formidable candidate democrats could field 
against boschwitz 
prominent minnesota democrats said they did not know what 
mondale would announce 
dfl gov rudy perpich who a few weeks ago publicly urged 
mondale to decide soon on the senate race said mondale has not 
told him whether he will run 
i dont have any idea i really dont perpich said

days ago 
mondale 61 represented minnesota in the senate from 1965 until 
1976 when he gave up his seat to become vice president under 
president carter

an attorney with a minneapolis law firm

the engineer who decided to stop a freight 
train on a steep slope and disconnect the locomotives causing a 
derailment and explosion didnt have the authority to do so a 
railroad official testified thursday 
michael lemm montana rail links trainmaster at helena said 
engineer robert estes was not in charge of the 49car train when he 
ordered the engines detached and realigned because the lead 
locomotive had lost power and heat 
lemm testified on the second day of a national transportation 
safety board hearing into an accident that knocked out electricity 
in helena on feb 2 when it was 27 degrees below zero and the wind 
chill was about 70 below 
estes was engineer of three helper locomotives assigned to 
assist the train over the mountains at the continental divide jody 
mccloud engineer of the train itself did not want to realign the 
locomotives but did not challenge estes decision he offered to 
run the train from the cold lead locomotive but estes rejected the 
idea 
while the locomotives were detached the train began rolling 
down the track 11 miles into helena where it collided with other 
locomotives several cars derailed and two carrying hydrogen 
peroxide and isopropyl alcohol were involved in an explosion that 
shattered windows for miles and severed power lines 
about 3500 residents were evacuated but there were no serious 
injuries damage has been estimated at 10 million 
the disagreement between estes and mccloud was detailed in 
testimony by the two men wednesday lemm was quizzed about the 
issue thursday 
i believe mr mccloud was in charge of that train he told 
ntsb officials 
while estes may have been controlling the train from his 
helper locomotive mccloud was responsible for the train itself 
and had the discretion to assume control lemm said 
also testifying thursday was fritz zettel hazardous materials 
specialist for the helena fire department he complained of 
problems in obtaining details on the cargo in some of the derailed 
cars 
he also recounted problems the city had with emergency 
communications during the power outage and said the railroad 
should involve city officials more in developing their plans for 
train accidents 
the final ntsb report on the accident is not expected until late 
this year

sharon rogers the navy skippers wife who 
narrowly escaped injury in the bombing of her van said thursday 
that the incident showed terrorism knows no boundaries 
it made us all realize that no nation or people can be immune 
from terrorist activity whatever the source mrs rogers said in 
a speech to a fundraising luncheon of san diego crime stoppers 
mrs rogers said she understood many people stood on the street 
and stared at her burnedout van and asked how could it happen 
how could it happen here 
thats what a terrorist wants us to do to create unreasoned 
fear isolation and forced modification of our lifestyles 
mrs rogers said but determination in our hearts to ensure that 
this does not occur turns a terrorist victory into defeat a 
unified community is an aware community and the execution of crime 
becomes much more difficult 
mrs rogers who has made few public appearances since the march 
10 bombing was among five women whose lives have been torn by 
violent crime to address the luncheon 
crime stoppers is administering the 40000 reward fund 
established in the case of the van bombing which occurred at a san 
diego intersection as mrs rogers drove to work alone she got out

the mistaken downing last july of an iranian airliner by the uss 
vincennes commanded by capt will c rogers iii

vincennes engaged in a surface skirmish with iranian gunboats 
fired two missiles at what it thought was an attacking iranian

seabrook nuclear power plant officials 
expressed joy thursday on winning approval to split their first 
atoms within two weeks after a decade of delays and billions of 
dollars in cost overruns 
plant foes who lost a threeyear battle to block lowpower 
testing promised to press their legal battle against commercial 
operation of the 6 billion plant 
we still have a long fight ahead of us said massachusetts 
attorney general james shannon whose state played a key role in 
stalling seabrook by refusing to cooperate in evacuation planning 
for it 
the antinuclear clamshell alliance which has organized 
demonstrations against seabrook since the first trees were cleared 
in 1976 continued preparing for a major rally the first weekend in 
june possibly coinciding with the first atomic chain reaction at 
the reactor 
a federal appeals court in washington on thursday rejected 
seabrook foes request to delay the tests and the nuclear 
regulatory commission said it would issue the lowpower license 
friday morning 
seabrook officials said they would start preparing for the tests 
as soon as they got the license and could be ready to start 
nuclear fission about 10 days later 
edward brown president of seabrook operator new hampshire 
yankee said the lowpower license marks a milestone for seabrook 
station and forecasts a promising energy future for all of new 
england 
most of the plants 1400 workers had already gone home by the 
time the court ruled seabrook spokesman ron sher said but for 
those people seen here there were certainly a lot of smiles and 
congratulations 
new hampshire gov judd gregg who conditionally supports 
seabrook reiterated his belief that starting lowpower tests 
before commercial operation is assured is probably not a good 
business decision 
they should wait until theyre closer to a final disposition 
on the fullpower license gregg said in a telephone interview 
there are still a lot of legal challenges still lying in the road 
as well as some major decisions to be made by the nuclear 
regulatory commission and its licensing board 
but gregg said he did not take legal action to try to block the 
tests because lead seabrook owner public service company of new 
hampshire has agreed not to charge ratepayers any costs associated 
with the tests 
in a statement the clamshell alliance said gregg does not yet 
fully realize the political burden he must now carry for his 
complicit silence in allowing this radioactive testing to occur 
nor do any of us fully realize the environmental burden we will 
pass on to future generations with the radioactive waste for which 
there is no known disposal 
about 10 clamshell members holding signs saying stop seabrook 
now gathered outside seabrooks gates as the court issued its 
ruling 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis complained that the plant 
will now be contaminated even though the nrc has made no final 
decision on the adequacy of the seabrook evacuation plan 
there is still no adequate plan to evacuate people in the 
event of an accident nor is there any evidence that such a plan 
can even be produced dukakis said in a statement in boston

us officials say they hope immediate trade 
talks can open markets in japan brazil and india and avert any 
backlash in those countries over being named to the 
administrations list of top trade violators 
this exercise is not intended to be offensive us trade 
representative carla a hills told a news conference thursday night 
as she announced the administration is targeting those countries 
for priority action under the 1988 trade law i hope there is no 
backlash 
the 1988 omnibus trade act requires the administration to issue 
what amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose trade 
barriers are most harmful to american producers the government 
then has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers 
failure of the talks could lead for tariffs of up to 100 percent 
on selected exports from the offending countries

house democrats anticipating a historic 
resignation next week of speaker jim wright are making plans for 
quickly promoting majority leader thomas s foley of washington to 
the powerful speakers post 
but intrigue is brewing for filling in the rest of the party 
leadership slots as some democrats worry that rep tony coelho 
foleys likely successor could hurt the party because of questions 
about his own financial dealings 
foley talking with reporters thursday in seattle said he spoke 
to wright earlier in the day and the speaker repeated his desire 
to have an opportunity to state his case his side of the case to 
the widest possible audience and hes determined to take that 
opportunity at the first time that seems appropriate 
i assume that will be with either next week or shortly 
thereafter foley said

former housing secretary samuel pierce 
provoked anger and disbelief among members of a congressional panel 
that questioned him about a housing subsidy program which 
investigators say was riddled with favoritism 
pierce who is now a new york lawyer told congressional 
investigators thursday that he wasnt directly involved in deciding 
which projects received grants under the program he said a 
committee of his subordinates at the department of housing and 
urban development selected the winners and his approval was a 
rubber stamp 
pierce said he wasnt influenced by wellconnected republicans 
and former hud officials who obtained a large portion of the 
multimilliondollar subsidy projects acting as consultants or 
developers 
perhaps we should have watched the program closer than we 
did pierce said in the closest he came to acknowledging any 
blame but weve got a whole department to run

before martika could even speak she was 
thinking about singing and dancing 
i feel like ive done it before probably in a previous life 
explained the 20yearold singer and actress who has released her 
selftitled debut album i think when i came out ofmy mothers 
womb i was ready to be a performer most people dont have that i 
can never explain why god only knows 
born marta marrero she began dance classes at 4 and was soon 
giving recitals at school martika the daughter of cuban 
immigrants also paid close attention to the new phenonema of music 
videos on television 
yeah it was big she recalled i grew up on mtv when i 
was 14 mtv was taking off thats when i got into pop culture 
club duran duran and madonna came out 
impatient to break into show business martika was calling 
agents at age 11 she had no interest in pursuing a conventional 
career 
i have friends who say i hate my job i wish i could do 
something else i say go do it i really believe you should 
follow your heart even if you have to go through rough times 
i know i wanted it badly enough i would have starved for it 
better that than making a lot of money in an office and being 
unhappy for the rest of my life 
rock singer madonna would prove to be a major influence on the 
aspiring star who admired her determination to succeed 
madonnas been really inspirational for me because she took 
herself from nothing to the hugest female pop star alive she 
introduced the whole dance music scene she paved the way for the 
rest of us people still dont take her seriously but shes still 
making records 
martika also chose to professionally use just one name but 
denied getting the idea from madonna afterall cher had done it 
before 
even when i was younger i thought it would be cool to have 
one name to have a unique name like martika the singer said 
i started using it when i was 16 i was acting and my agent said 
i should save having one name for my recording career casting 
directors would complain to the agencies that i didnt have a last 
name 
martika landed a minor role in the 1982 film version of 
annie she went on to appear on several television shows 
including silver spoons diffrent strokes hardcastle amp 
mccormick and the childrens variety series kids 
incorporated 
when she turned 18 she set her sights on the music industry 
spending a year preparing songs with producerwriter michael jay 
miami sound machine stephanie mills she needed just two months 
to record the album a collection of dance tracks and ballads 
the first single more than you know reached the top 20 
but martikas favorite song on the album is the antidrug toy 
soldiers which she wrote herself 
i was a little hesitant because i had only written two songs 
before and they were light songs i came up to michael and said i 
wanted to write about drugs it was the first time i got the nerve 
to write about something that was scary for me to talk about so i 
did she said 
martika wrote the song about a friend who had been addicted to 
cocaine 
he cant listen to it she said it gives him the chills 
he says it affects him too much he knows its about him he loves 
it he thinks its a beautiful song but when he listens to my 
record he skips over that 
martika also does a dance version of carole kings i feel the 
earth move the young singer was just 3 when kings classic 
tapestry album was released and knew little about her work 
i listened to the melody once and put it away because i didnt 
want to be influenced by her performance i wanted to do it my 
way she said doing a remnake you get the opportunity to 
revive something for the older generation but you can also 
introduce a great old song to kids who never knew it existed 
fans should be warned that martika does not expect to stay in 
music very long although she considers singing her first great 
love martika would eventually like to concentrate on movies 
i think an actor can grow old a bit more gracefully she 
explained i see myself doing pop music while i have the energy 
and then getting married and doing one film every year or two 
there are so many parts of me outside of martika the singer 
theres a real person in here somewhere

when margie moberg wilson complained to 
her husband about poor city services he challenged her to do 
something about it 
the 49yearold real estate agent mother of five and 
grandmother of five now is nine months into a term as mayor of her 
financially ailing hometown a mobile suburb suffering from nearly 
two decades of white flight 
prichards 38000 residents 78 percent of them black have an 
average income of 12000 to 15000 unemployment is 135 percent 
compared with 115 percent a year ago its 800 units of public 
housing have a waiting list and wilson avenue the main street is 
lined with boardedup businesses 
i am determined to see this city cleaned up said mrs 
wilson who has urged residents to bring solutions not complaints 
to city hall 
offsetting her determination is the cold reality of economics 
prichard hasnt had a printed budget since 1972 but jim longino 
the finance director mrs wilson hired said it will be 488000 in 
the red this year the city has been operating without insurance 
since last year 
when you ride through downtown prichard you see that there is 
very little if any real type of retail or any other services that 
are generating a taxable base that would allow the city to start to 
grow again said floyd pough who works in a community assistance 
program 
whites began moving out with the election of the first of three 
black mayors democrat a j cooper in 1972 as whites moved out 
poor blacks from north mobile began moving in cooper resigned in 
1980 convinced that blacks had taken control of their own 
destiny which had been his goal 
the mass exodus by whites that threw the situation out of 
balance still continues said the rev jj phillips of mount 
sinai baptist church he said the challenge remains poverty and the 
white flight that took business with it 
black people want the same things as whites nice homes good 
jobs said mrs wilson who is white she eked out a 31443050 
victory over jesse norwood a black democrat in a runoff election 
in september after he defeated twoterm gop incumbent john smith 
the job pays 35000 a year 
prichard is still prichard regardless of who is mayor 
phillips said 
real estate agent paul buchman said mrs wilson hasnt been in 
office long enough to judge she has on one or two occasions 
mentioned some things but they are in the formatives stages and 
its difficult to talk about 
its not possible to counter poverty until such time as they 
see some change in the neighborhood situation buchman said many 
of the residents of a large part of the city are on welfare and 
most of the households are headed by women with children 
employed residents including the new mayor tend to live in the 
part of the city known as eight mile 
and regardless of whos in city hall he said it must address 
the areas that are druginfested and have no money 
the inner city is where the problem lies innercity crime 
and i dont know how were going to stop that 
pough lived in prichard for 27 years but moved to mobile in 
1980 to buy a house that would not decline in value not many 
people want to live in a city where you have a high rate of 
unemployment and youre not getting services from the city in 
terms of police protection he said 
his agency can help the poor and homeless in the short term 
but you get people who are out saying i need to work can you 
help me once you get people who cant find affordable 
housing and jobs that will pay them a decent salary to get off 
welfare rolls to work on a daily basis they are trapped 
residents expect to see some revitalization from the new 
administration said pough i guess what theyre looking for is a 
new beginning from a black administration to a person who is 
white female they are looking for something thats different from 
the past

east german claims to channel waters 
off this lucrative polish port have been fraying the frontier of 
friendship that separates the east bloc neighbors since 1985 but 
the door now is open to a solution 
poland and east germany have signed an agreement to readjust 
their borders with the aim of settling once and for all a dispute 
that was given scant official public attention but became an open 
secret on the piers of the baltic coast 
because of the dispute both sides put border guards in place on 
the wide beach west of the port and signs warned strollers marking 
buoys were set out in the channel which winds back and forth from 
the high seas to the port 
the port of swinoujscie straddles the narrow opening of a bay 
that leads to polands largest port szczecin 40 miles to the 
south on the odra oder in german river 
the conflict erupted after east germany extended its territorial 
waters to 12 miles from shore in 1985 and started to enforce its 
claim to parts of the channel approach to swinoujscie that had been 
under polish administration 
the agreement aimed at solving the frictions was signed may 22 
in east berlin by the polish and east german foreign ministers 
essentially east germany agreed to abandon most of its 
territorial claims where they intersected the shipping lanes to and 
from the polish port in exchange east germany gets fishing rights 
in part of the bay 
only part of the westernmost approach to the bay will remain 
waters of east germany which promises not to disturb polish ship 
traffic there 
the agreement is a common success for both states said the 
chief polish negotiator wladyslaw napieraj in an official 
statement 
a few years ago east german coast guard cutters had closed in 
on ships that allegedly strayed out of polish waters warning them 
over bullhorns they were violating east german territory said 
jozef chabowski a department director at the polish shipping 
company 
we were facing the problem that east germany said we were 
operating on waters they claim dont belong to us so the issue 
must be settled it was a show of authority from their side to 
the ships he said 
but he added that the incidents have been less frequent in the 
past year 
the dispute arose at about the time poland had made public plans 
to open a dutyfree zone in swinoujscieszczecin while east 
germany was investing heavily to build up its baltic port at 
rostock 80 miles to the west 
jozef stebnicki of the maritime office that handles shipping 
complaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected and 
boleslaw stolowicz chairman of the certa fish cooperative said it 
was a problem for deepsea fishing companies 
talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last june 
when polands gen wojciech jaruzelski met erich honecker the east 
german leader in the former german city of wroclaw a government 
spokesman at that time said an agreement was near 
we here in the western territories of poland are especially 
sensitive to these problems because of the most recent history 
said jerzy timen an editor at the szczecinbased weekly newspaper 
morze i ziemia sea and earth 
timen who has written extensively on the dispute said polish 
authorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and that 
officials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put the 
conflict in a national and international context 
everyone was talking about it but articles didnt appear 
although you could sneak certain problems into professional or 
factory publications he said 
but polish underground newspapers from the area reported 
extensively on the dispute and said that polish vessels at one 
point were being stopped and inspected by east germans 
just after world war ii the area around swinoujscieszczecin 
previously german was turned over to poland 
the german towns of swinemuende and stettin became swinoujscie 
and szczecin 
resident germans were forced to leave while polish refugees 
were moved in after having been expelled by the soviet union from 
what before the war had been the eastern part of poland 
as relations between poland and east germany improved in the 
1970s poles and east germans only had to show national identity 
cards to cross the border poles flocked to east germany to shop at 
its better stocked stores 
but after the rise of the independent solidarity trade union in 
198081 east germans required poles to use passports and issued 
poles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation 
now the majority of germans in the restaurants and on the 
beaches are tourists from west berlin only a twohour drive away 
who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them among other 
things to eat a firstrate dinner for the equivalent of only about 
10

spain and portugal the names often are 
said in one breath and today there are even more reasons to group 
the iberian neighbors together 
but many portuguese dislike it 
feeling overshadowed by bigger richer spain the portuguese 
point to the differences between them 
there is a division a looking at spain as the enemy said 
fernando brito soares an economics professor at lisbons new 
university its in the cultural background 
he cites an old portuguese saying de espanha ni bom vento ni 
bom casamento from spain neither good wind nor good marriage 
said nicholas racich an american banker who has lived in both 
countries there is always a sense of competition and wariness 
among the portuguese toward spaniards 
spaniard jorge hay a director of banco hispano americano in 
madrid said portugal was always a bit obsessed with spain the 
portuguese always define themselves as something different than 
spain 
spaniards dont seem to spend much time thinking about the 
portuguese and luis campos e cunha another new university 
professor agrees 
we talk much more about them than they talk about us 
the prejudices are typical of large and small neighbors many 
portuguese think spaniards are loud and overbearing many spaniards 
think portuguese are insecure and backward 
seafaring nations spain and portugal traditionally have had 
little to do with each other although they share the iberian 
peninsula arent divided by mountains or rivers and dont need 
passports to cross the border 
portugal was always a little country against a big one during 
centuries portugal had to defend itself against the spanish desire 
to annex portugal said fernando barciela a madridbased 
correspondent for portugals main newspaper diaro de noticias 
spain ruled portugal for only 60 years until 1640 but the 
portuguese have never gotten over that racich said 
the portuguese still boast that their country was the only 
iberian region ultimately to escape castilian control 
to escape spanish domination portugal formed a strong bond with 
england and created a culture so independent of spain that today 
it remains almost impervious to its neighbors influence barciela 
said 
but the relationship changed dramatically when the two joined 
the european economic community in 1986 
it forced traditionally protectionist spain to start dropping 
its trade barriers that means spain now buys more products from 
others countries including portugal whose tradebased economy 
traditionally has been more open 
with the approach of 1992 when the 12 nations of the eec open 
up trade among themselves spain has been investing more in 
portugal it invested 119 million in portugal in 1988 five times 
the 1985 amount portuguese investment in spain is still 
insignificant 
in five years time there will exist an iberian economy not 
just a spanish economy said francisco capelo director of 
capital markets for banco international do funchal sa in lisbon 
i believe iberia will be much more integrated 
portuguese exports to spain almost quadrupled to 13 billion in 
1988 from 1985 while spanish exports to portugal almost trebled to 
22 billion according to the spanish government 
tourism has grown with millions of travelers going in both 
directions each year 
but there are problems 
its still very difficult for any portuguese product to get 
into spain said jaime de lacerda director of the confederation 
of portuguese industry 
there are some fears that the portuguese economy can be 
swallowed by spanish enterprises he added in portugal all 
this spanish investment is seen as dangerous from a point of view 
of its identity 
some portuguese are worried that their governments new 
privatization program will result in spaniards buying up the 
maximum foreign holdings allowed in the sales of stateowned 
companies 
spain is about five times the size of portugal its population 
of 388 million is more than triple portugals with per capita 
gross domestic product of about 7400 spain is twice as 
prosperous 
in spain economically and in terms of mindset they are 10 
years ahead of portugal said racich the american banker 
madrid is a gleaming modern capital lisbon is a very large 
village 
they also keep different hours both take long lunches but at 
different times which could be an annoyance in an intermeshed 
economy the portuguese start theirs at 1 pm and return around 
230 or 3 the spaniards start at 230 and return at 430 or 5 the 
portuguese end the work day at 6 pm and the spaniards around 7 or 
8 pm 
the languages are very different the portuguese generally can 
understand spoken spanish but most spaniards cant understand 
portuguese 
portuguese radio plays spanish music and the portuguese who can 
afford it have dishes that receive spanish tv but the fare of 
portuguesespeaking brazil in south america is more popular 
people have a misconception that portugal is a macho 
country says cunha 
portuguese womens participation in the work force is one of 
europes highest although primarily through menial agricultural 
jobs while spanish womens is the lowest 
a woman maria pintasilgo was briefly portugals prime minister 
in 19791980

fortdefrance martinique ap western europes move toward a 
single trading market by the end of 1992 has raised some concern on 
martinique and guadeloupe french islands 4500 miles from paris 
a fear is that the elimination of trade barriers within the 
12nation european economic community will trigger an invasion of 
wealthy land speculators and jobless immigrants that could threaten 
the islands caribbean identity 
on may 1 labor day hundreds of trade unionists poured into the 
streets of fortdefrance martiniques capital to voice their 
concern over the dangers of european integration as one 
official put it 
protesters maintained that removing tariffs on european goods 
coming into martinique will stifle local production and the 
unrestricted circulation of capital will make it easier for 
europeans to buy land and businesses on the island 
emmanuel ibene coleader of the guadeloupean communist party 
said a new status is being imposed on us and nobody has asked 
our opinion 
guadeloupe and martinique about 150 miles apart halfway down 
the arc of the lesser antilles are french overseas departments 
they are as much a part of france as hawaii is of the united states 
bakeries parisian accents compact citroen cars cyclists 
wearing flashy racing tights training on picturesque rural roads 
all resemble france 
many metropolitans as the european french are called own 
small shops and restaurants on the two islands european drifters 
peddle jewelry on street corners or sing and play guitars at 
sidewalk cafes 
with 500000 resettled french west indians france itself is 
influenced by caribbean culture every islander has relatives or 
friends in france and their music zouk similar to calypso 
has millions of fans 
being french the islands are part of the european economic 
community air travelers arriving here line up under customs signs 
that read in french noneec citizens and eec citizens the 
latter need no passports 
a single european market with no travel employment or residency 
restrictions would open the floodgates to immigration opponents 
say 
there are 23 million unemployed in europe it only takes half 
a million to immigrate here and were finished said claude 
makouke leader of the small separatist popular union for the 
liberation of guadeloupe 
the danger for guadeloupe of remaining french is our cultural 
disappearance through intermixing with europeans makouke said 
for us 1992 is the coup de grace 
most of the 680000 residents of martinique and guadeloupe are 
of african descent with a sprinkling of east indians and europeans 
not everybody is opposed to a single european market the 
regional assemblies of both islands favor the idea 
every martiniquan should plant a banana tree for europe 
because the market is there said pierre petit leader of the 
islands rightists and mayor of the mountain town of morne rouge 
europe is what we need to lift us out of our torpor 
french west indians enjoy a high standard of living receiving 
free health care and generous unemployment benefits but 25 percent 
of the work force is unemployed and 30 percent have government 
jobs the french state is the main source of income followed by 
banana exports and tourism 
people think that in 1992 were going to see fleets of 747s 
flying in here packed with wealthy west germans coming to buy up 
all the business said pierreluc st yves a credit martiniquais 
bank manager were already part of the eec the germans could 
have come long ago 
yet many islanders are alarmed at the quantity of farm land 
bought by european investors to build villas and hotels they also 
fear the abolition in 1992 of a special tax on goods imported from 
france towns here draw 50 percent of their revenues from the tax 
even eec advocates like petit and st yves argue that measures 
must be taken to preserve the tax and protect real estate from 
european speculators 
support for integration with france dates to the french 
revolution of 1789 newly freed slaves saw alliance with the 
revolutionary government in paris as a weapon against the local 
elite 
residents of martinique guadeloupe and french guiana frances 
other overseas department on the northern shoulder of south 
america vote in french elections and elect deputies and senators 
to the national assembly in paris 
since francois mitterrand a socialist was elected president of 
france in 1981 and turned over powers to local assemblies the 
french caribbean islands have been run by their regional councils 
they control their own budgets development projects cultural 
programs and tourism 
decentralization undercut support for independence still 
unpopular despite anxiety over the eec of 1992 
our demand to have our cultural identity recognized has often 
been misinterpreted as a desire for independence said camille 
darsiere president of martiniques regional assembly 
while independence is a nonissue in martinique a small but 
vocal separatist movement simmers in guadeloupe where a rash of 
bombings in the early 1980s killed eight people and ended with the 
1984 arrest of separatist militant luc reinette 
independence is losing ground the word is used just to be 
heard said lucette michauxchevry deputy in the french national 
assembly and leader of guadeloupes rightists we are a success 
story whether you like it or not the french experiment worked 
here

its not unusual for an actor to appear 
regularly on two television shows but j eddie peck had pivotal

weektoweek contract with dynasty and they wouldnt tell me what 
was going to happen after i got hired by dallas i was called 
back to dynasty the people at dallas didnt want to let me go 
and i did eight shows it was on my resume that i was on dynasty 
but they apparently missed it the two shows dont want to share 
actors 
peck was supposed to do only four shows for dynasty but 
ended up doing seven 
peck said he particularly likes his character on dallas 
because of his many facets 
hes a wild wild man he said he has a lot of pain a 
lot of anguish he has a bitter relationship with his father you 
see a sympathetic level beneath the dark side i really took the 
character out on a limb theres a rage and frustration they didnt 
originally intend but once i tried it they liked it and started 
writing it that way 
in the beginning peck didnt want to be an actor but says 
eventually i fell in love with it 
his first roles were in the daytime soaps the young and the 
restless and days of our lives later he had a recurring role 
in an nbc show double trouble

actor sam waterston listened to the tapes to 
prepare for his role as abraham lincoln in a tv movie a florida 
woman heard the voices of her greatgrandmothers on the tapes 
regarded as a priceless scholarly record of the voices of america 
the accents of americans famous and ordinary from groucho marx 
and eleanor roosevelt to arkansas sharecroppers new yorks puerto 
rican teenagers serbian ironworkers from minnesota chesapeake 
bay watermen and gullahs from coastal south carolina are preserved 
on 250 hours of tapes in the archives of the library of congress 
among the treasures are the rarely heard voice of vanished 
aviator amelia earhart the story of an 1869 whaling voyage told by 
a nantucket mass seafarer an elderly maine lady reciting her 
watermelon rind recipe and the first american recording by 
alistair cooke a caustic young british drama student in 1934 who 
describes his loathing of hollywood 
the dialect recordings are housed in the librarys american 
folklife center the centers archive of folk culture contains more 
than 35000 hours of audio cylinders discs wires and tapes and 
more than 100000 pages of manuscripts of songs instrumental 
music folk tales oral histories and other forms of american 
cultural expression 
the first major collection was donated to the folklife center in 
1984 by the american dialect society a professional organization 
of linguistic scholars it consists of 1300 aluminum 78rpm discs 
of regional american speech 132 hours in all that were recorded 
in the early 1930s by field workers for a projected linguistic 
atlas of north america 
the library is nearing completion of the timeconsuming task of 
transferring those recordings from discs to standard 10inch 
doubletrack mylar tapes for permanent storage 
then in 1986 the center for applied linguistics a nonprofit 
washington education and research organization donated an 118hour 
sampler of american dialects drawn from previously inaccessible 
private collections 
those tapes were compiled from scattered private holdings by the 
centers project director donna christian with the help of a 
79000 grant from the national endowment for the humanities 
the library of congress called her tape collection which took 
more than two years to assemble an aural kaleidoscope of the 
american experience 
gerald parsons reference librarian at the american folklife 
center said the tapes are a gold mine for genealogical 
purposes because the 1930s recordings frequently included 
ordinary people talking informally about their home territory 
complete with family names birth dates and burial sites 
one woman visitor from florida appeared at the center recently 
to inquire about elderly relatives now dead who were supposed to 
have been interviewed and recorded by famed folklorist john lomax 
about 50 years ago 
within five or 10 minutes she was sitting here with 
earphones listening to the voices of her two greatgrandmothers 
parsons said 
as part of his research for the role of lincoln in the nbc 
miniseries gore vidals lincoln in march 1988 sam waterston 
spent two days at the folklife center listening to 1940s recordings 
of natives of the smoky mountains 
no one knows exactly what lincoln sounded like parsons said so 
waterston sought clues from the speech patterns of people from 
eastern kentucky lincoln was reared in kentucky in the 1820s by 
immigrant parents but his speech probably was influenced more 
strongly in those formative years by his western virginia mother 
than his fathers massachusetts forebears 
sam listened to the smoky mountain samples knowing full well 
they were not carbon copies of what lincoln spoke but our best 
guess was that they were as close as you can come today to his 
mothers speech parsons said 
ms christian and walt wolfram her research associate at the 
center for applied linguistics said in an interview that americas 
regional dialects remain strong and distinctive today 
they agreed that the homogenizing influence of television and 
easy mobility have diluted some of the peculiarities of speech in 
isolated regions such as appalachia where expressions like im 
agoing and hits a nice day are heard less often 
but the southern dialect once deliberately softened to make it 
more socially acceptable is enjoying a resurgence in the 
cosmopolitan new south where being a dixie native is a source 
of newfound pride they noted 
likewise they said natives of marthas vineyard and other new 
england vacation spots are emphasizing their distinctive speech to 
retain their identity amid hordes of summertime visitors 
dont let all those lookalike strips along the interstate 
highways fool you wolfram said theres a certain deceptiveness 
to what looks alike he said the guy behind the counter at 
mcdonalds in pennsylvania will say have a good day and the guy 
in arkansas will still say have a goodun

the 15yearold girl was defiant 
just because you tell me i cant have an abortion doesnt mean 
im going to go home and tell my mom she told the judge im 
going to another court 
the teenager was preparing an appeal with a legal services 
lawyer but was spared the fight when an appeals court overturned 
the states abortionconsent law in a case involving another 
central florida girl identified only as tw 
after hopscotching up to the us supreme court and back tws 
case is now before floridas highest court for a june 27 hearing on 
whether the state can constitutionally require unmarried minors to 
get parental or judicial consent for an abortion 
tw is believed to have received an abortion after the law was 
put on hold but neither she nor her lawyer jerri blair would 
discuss her condition 
the new florida law has focused attention on teenage pregnancy 
and on the difficulties in adding legal restrictions for minors 
abortions 
ruth arick director of the birth control center in orlando 
used the case of the defiant 15yearold girl to illustrate those 
difficulties 
that girl and a 16yearold who got an abortion the same day had 
been denied underage waivers by judges ms arick said 
we had told them that with all the ups and downs in the 
courtrooms to just hang in there said ms arick who described 
the younger girl as very persistent an only daughter whose 
parents had considered her a perfect child who could do no wrong 
she felt that if they found out about her pregnancy they 
would not trust her ever again and limit her activities the rest of 
the time she was in that house ms arick said 
dr alfred h moffett who delivered babies in nearby leesburg 
for 16 years until quitting obstetrics earlier this year said 
teenage pregnancy is a major problem both here in lake county 
and in many areas of the state everyone who practices 
obstetrics sees 12 13 and 14yearolds having babies 
moffett said 25 percent to 30 percent of the indigent patients 
he treated at leesburg regional medical center were minor 
unmarried girls 
that is in line with estimates from abortionrights activists 
who say minors received about a third of the 75000 abortions 
performed in florida last year 
teenage pregnancies are on the rise moffett said we 
dont need all kinds of statistics to know that we need to teach 
these young ladies what to do thats why sex education in the 
schools is so terribly important 
the primary reason for young pregnancies moffett believes is a 
lack of guidance at home church and school 
they dont know how or what to do and how to keep from getting 
pregnant he said the moral implications are up to the family 
and the church but someone needs to teach them the mechanics 
in a report released may 24 the southern regional project on 
infant mortality said the south has a higher rate of teenage 
pregnancy than the rest of the nation and called for an intensified 
education campaign aimed at boys as well as young girls 
when our children have children we all lose said 
mississippi gov ray mabus cochairman of the group 
the report said southern girls under age 17 accounted for 47 
percent of the nations 178000 teenage births in 1985 although 
the region was home to just 37 percent of the girls in that age 
group 
floridas consent law which was enacted in february required a 
girl under 18 who did not have her parents consent for an abortion 
to go before a judge and convince him that her parents were 
unreasonable in withholding consent or that she feared physical or 
emotional abuse if she requested help from parents or a guardian 
before that a girl legally did not need anyones permission 
although many hospitals clinics and doctors required some type of 
parental authorization 
the consent law might have little effect from a practical 
standpoint said dr samuel barr a gynecologist who is director of 
the epoc clinic in the orlando suburb of maitland 
contrary to the righttolife propaganda most minors come 
with their parents barr said and the parents are as anxious 
if not more anxious than their 12 or 13 or 15yearold 
daughter for an abortion 
a 15yearold who identified herself only as sarah had an 
abortion at the birth control center in orlando recently with her 
mothers consent 
it wouldnt have been as easy for some of my friends as it was 
for me because their parents would not have been as supportive 
she said 
however if her mother had not agreed sarah said i dont 
think it would have been worth going to the court or whatever i had 
to do besides it would have been like going behind my mothers 
back 
at the beta center in orlando another 15yearold cathy spoke 
fearfully about her problems 
seven months pregnant she is saddened at having been 
disowned by her father although her mother would have agreed to 
an abortion she says she and her boyfriend will put the baby up 
for adoption 
i never thought of an abortion the law didnt matter to 
me she said 
but she added the pair never considered the consequences of 
having a baby they never thought about finishing school or the 
money or anything she said that was just being selfish we 
probably would be living off welfare or something if they had 
decided to keep the child 
that lack of knowledge and thought is why moffett gives sex 
education lectures at schools church fellowships and youth 
organizations 
i just spoke to about 90 fifthgrade girls at fruitland park 
about contraception and the questions from the 10 11 and 
12yearold kids would just blow your socks off he said 
they ask about condoms and intercourse and the pill these 
children are getting the information but theyre getting it off 
the playground 
moffett said he feared the consequences of restrictive abortion 
laws 
what were seeing are efforts to legislate away abortions 
he said they may be made legal or illegal but they wont go 
away they may have to go underground again and thats a bigger 
tragedy then we will lose mothers as well as fetuses

four years ago the hartford stage 
company was struggling with a huge deficit and a drastic decline in 
ticket subscriptions 
today thanks to some brilliant management and artistic 
performances the theater has not only rebounded with budget 
surpluses and soldout shows but will receive a coveted tony award 
as the outstanding regional theater in the country when the 
theater honors its own on june 4 
mark lamos hartford stages 43yearold artistic director now 
in his ninth year at the theater says the award recognizes a 
quartercentury of theatrical achievement but he admits that four 
years ago no matter how laudable the productions the critics 
accolades probably would have gone unheard 
i think when the theater began the first two regimes of 
artists and managers were not at all concerned about getting the 
word out lamos said there was a sense that we disdain any 
sort of national opportunity any sort of national recognition 
that began to seem a little bit unrealistic to me i thought 
here we have this beautiful new theater were doing work on a big 
scale were in a highly competitive charged atmosphere of 
theater excellence well lets be a part of that 
hartford stage captured critics attention with its modern 
adaptations of classical works 
its current triumph is a monumental twopart fivehour 
production of peer gynt which played to soldout crowds from 
all over the country before closing a week ago michael kuchwara 
drama critic for the associated press called it a glorious 
theatrical adventure a journey that lamos manages to make both 
epic and intimate 
last year lamos staged a moderndress production of hamlet 
set in a banana republic in turmoil 
lamos whose sixplay repertoire each season includes at least 
half new plays admits he prefers classics for their ability to 
be inflamed again by living actors and with passion and speak 
right to us 
the large plays from a century or two or longer ago have such 
a tremendous scope i feel they exist for us now so that we can get 
in touch with something that we lost both spiritually and as a 
society he said whether its a play by aeschylus about the 
murder of agamemnon or whether its a shakespearean comedy about 
the possibility of forgiveness in an imperfect world no matter 
what it is its going to be something that widens youre ideas 
about the world 
it theater is a place for real spectacle real wonder 
mystery ambiguity all the reasons you go to church all the 
reasons the greeks initially went to the theater to be sort of 
blown away by the mystery of it 
but lamos looking youthful in blue jeans and hightop sneakers 
says those lofty thoughts have little to do with hartford stages 
rise to national prominence instead he credits david hawkanson 
his managerial counterpart in a business suit and glasses 
hawkanson was lured from the arizona theatre company in tucson 
he inherited an accumulated deficit of 440000 and 7900 
subscribers down from 17000 in 1977 when he arrived in 
connecticut in 1985 he hired marketing and public relations teams 
began a telemarketing campaign and went after the national press 
each year since hawkansons arrival the company has posted 
operating surpluses reducing the overall deficit to 110000 
hawkanson expects it to be completely wiped out by next year 
in 1989 the theaters 25th anniversary subscriptions are back 
up to 15000 and attendance this year is expected to total 
120000 or about 95 percent of capacity 
we worked very hard to get national criticism hawkanson 
said an actor will give up nine weeks to work here if they think 
it will not get lost our ability to attract those people is 
directly related to their perception about what is being done 
here 
the decision of emmyaward winning actor richard thomas the 
waltons to return for a second production in hartford is proof 
of the strategys success last year he played the title role in 
hamlet this year eager to tackle another difficult role and 
to work again with lamos he returned for peer gynt and he 
looks forward to returning a third time 
its a great thing to find someone with whom one wants to work 
and get satisfaction thomas said an actor of my caliber 
should be pleased to work at a theater like hartford 
they do interesting new plays and revivals of older ones 
because its in hartford and one doesnt earn a lot of money 
people seem to think its a sacrifice to work here it isnt at 
all 
the special tony based on recommendations by the american 
theater critics association is presented by the league of american 
theater producers and the american theater wing lamos and 
hawkanson will accept it during televised tony ceremonies on june 
4 making hartford the second connecticut theater to receive a tony 
for outstanding regional theater in the awards 14year history 
long wharf theatre in new haven received the award in 1978

lacking an assistant secretary for 
interamerican affairs secretary of state james a baker iii had 
to put in 40 hours negotiating with leaders of congress on us aid 
to the nicaraguan contras 
lacking presidential appointees to 33 key jobs in the defense 
department the pentagon had to tell congress it couldnt meet 
deadlines for decisions on mobile missiles a scaleddown star 
wars the cost of the new b2 stealth bomber or the impact of a 
prospective arms treaty 
lacking experts to run the huge savannah river nuclear weapons 
plant in south carolina energy secretary james watkins fears that 
the nation will run out of tritium a key component for nuclear 
warheads and frets this is unilateral disarmament were talking 
about 
one twelfth of the way into george bushs fouryear term of 
office the government still lacks key players in key places 
by the white houses count bush appointees are confirmed and on 
the job in only 25 percent of the 447 key policymaking posts 
requiring senate confirmation 
charles g untermeyer the white house personnel chief 
acknowledges it is certainly taking longer than we would like 
but untermeyer waves away the concerns expressed all over 
washington that bushs slowness in fielding his own team is keeping 
alive an image of a presidency that lacks mission purpose and 
vision 
he offers an array of defenses and explanations 
it is a friendly takeover so no harm is done if some 
reagan holdovers remain aboard for a few more months we look 
upon them as people who are carrying on the policy that george bush 
embraced he says 
better slow than sorry untermeyer says hed rather explain now 
why a job is still vacant than explain months for now that a bad 
apple was shoved in because we were being pressured to name 
someone 
it takes longer to find qualified women and minorities the 
administration is pleased that so far 20 percent of presidential 
appointments have gone to people in those categories to date 
according to ross starek deputy to untermeyer important jobs have 
gone to 36 women 13 blacks seven hispanics and three people of 
asian heritage 
some of the still unfilled jobs have unusual technical 
requirements such as the assistant secretary of commerce who 
serves as commissioiner of patents and trademarks untermeyer 
wonders aloud why such posts are political appointments in the 
first place 
background checks by the fbi are vital but slow down the 
process untermeyer says they take take one to two months the 
bureau disagrees saying it does the job in 22 days on average 
the first months of a new administration are spent in making 
policy and the rest of the time in carrying it out for 
policymaking the key players chiefly the cabinet are in place 
so says untermeyer the lack of an assistant secretary here 
or there has not kept george bush from getting a budget compromise 
settling the fsx the joint usjapan jet fighter working out 
the sampl bailout or developing proposals on child care education 
and gun control these are the hallmarks of an administration that 
is up and running 
others dispute that view as rosy at an agency where only four 
of 20 key positions have been filled an official who spoke on 
condition he would not be identified said my sense is that the 
secretary has got to be frustrated he has half a dozen major 
things on his plate and for the moment has only a few people to 
deal with them 
other facts complicate the situation 
during a senate armed services committee hearing sen john 
warner rva had an aide read off some data warner had assembled 
18 to 24 people had turned down the job of undersecretary of 
defense for acquisition most cited the pay level or a new ethics 
law with a stiff revolving door provision that keeps people who 
leave government from taking a job in an industry they dealt with 
while in government 
but untermeyer says bush is moving as fast as predecessors 
he says george bush has nominated 156 people vs 184 at this 
time for ronald reagan he has announced his intention to nominate 
another 45 and has retained 13 reagan appointees for a total of 
214 so hes practically at the same level as president reagan was 
eight years ago the notion that we are slow is with no fixed 
point of reference 
for all that those in charge of running pieces of the 
government are not so patient 
in almost every executive agency key decisions are postponed 
because those who will make them or live with them are not in 
place key jobs are occupied by reagan holdovers who are unsure 
whether theyre going to be retained and unlikely to sign off on 
any new initiatives 
at the energy department slowness in filling key posts is 
delaying getting the admirals agenda off the ground said joseph 
w easton executive assistant to watkins the retired naval 
officer named by bush to run the department if you dont have 
your team together how can you play the game 
at the pentagon the long battle over the nomination of john g 
tower to be defense secretary stalled action on issues requiring 
political or policy judgments some people who were hired and 
started working when it appeared tower would be in charge have been 
told theyre out of work under defense secretary richard b cheney 
the federal aviation administration hasnt had an administrator 
since allan mcartor left on feb 17 critical issues are piling up 
the need to deal with aging airliners international terrorism a 
crunch in airport capacity and a continuing shortage of air traffic 
controllers bush has chosen an admiral james b busey iv to take 
over the faa but that will require a law exempting him from a 
requirement that the job go to a civilian

along florida waterways starting to resemble an 
aquatic interstate 95 a new kind of traffic is worrying the marine 
patrol water scooters sometimes piloted by children hardly old 
enough to ride a bicycle 
the model names ring with excitement kawasaki makes jet skis 
yamaha sells wave runners and progressive power corp offers the 
surf jet for example 
but the boats that resemble snowmobiles are increasingly a 
factor in some of floridas worst accidents and complaints about 
operators are growing 
the florida marine patrol seems to come in contact with an 
awful lot of people who are not safe and responsible who are not 
reasonable and prudent said patrol capt mike lamphear they 
have lost touch with reality 
a 9yearold boy died in march after his scooter dead in the 
water was hit by another of the 7footlong craft in biscayne bay 
off miami a 5yearold boy survived after his head and chest were 
slashed open by a boat that ran over his scooter in a lake north of 
miami also in march 
jb spence attorney for the family of the 9yearold victim 
accuses operators of terrorizing swimmers and other boaters and has 
a personal lawsuit pending against riders who frequent a canal by 
his house in the florida keys 
you see what theyre like theyre like bucking broncos they 
ride the wake they race said spence who likens the machines 
sound to the roar of a chainsaw theyre just absolutely so rude 
and arrogant that i sued them im going to take them into court 
and try to teach them some manners 
the two miami accidents have focused attention on the first 
statewide effort to regulate the lowriding vessels that are 
propelled by a concentrated jet of water riders sit or kneel on 
the machines depending on the model 
the six manufacturers of personal watercraft which generally 
cost 2500 to 4500 support the legislation by state sen tom 
mcpherson and view it as a national model to regulate the skis and 
their freewheeling operators 
the measure was approved unanimously in late april by the 
florida senate and was passed overwhelmingly by the house last 
friday 
quick to realize they could be at risk from government 
regulators the manufacturers the other three are wet jet 
international bombardier and ultranautics support mcphersons 
bill it sets an operator age limit of 14 for private vessels and 
16 for rentals banning reckless operation restricting operation 
to daylight hours requiring operators to wear floatation vests and 
a cutoff switch to stop the engine if the rider falls off 
violation a seconddegree misdemeanor would carry a 35 fine or 
60 days in jail 
weaving through congested traffic jumping wakes and playing 
chicken would be outlawed said maj denis grealish boating 
safety coordinator for the marine patrol none of our 
investigations have revealed any inherent safety problem or defects 
with the craft 
all of our problems have been caused by operator error when 
you look at these types of craft and the type of quick fast 
movement theyre capable of and the centrifugal forces operating 
against these people as theyre making turns you have to have a 
certain amount of strength coordination balance and judgment to 
operate these things 
the personal watercraft industry association representing the 
six manufacturers also is monitoring other efforts to regulate the 
craft such as an assortment of new hampshire bills that would ban 
the vessels on small lakes where residents have registered noise 
complaints 
the organization estimates that 150000 americans own the 
scooters 
most regulations are imposed locally for specific water bodies 
but the industry hopes to take the florida bill to texas next in 
its bid to spread the measure nationally said john dane 
government relations representative in washington for the national 
marine manufacturers association 
were hoping this bill serves as a national model dane said 
the problem in florida is compounded by burgeoning enthusiasm 
for boating roughly 680000 vessels including 10000 personal 
watercraft are registered to operate along floridas 1350 miles 
of coastline and 11000 miles of rivers creeks and streams 
grealish estimates another 200000 to 300000 boats operate in 
florida on a transient basis 
the state leads the nation in boating fatalities with 106 in 
1987 and 94 in 1988 six involved personal watercraft last year of 
the states 11 fatalities with personal watercraft only two 
involved minors most victims are men ranging from their late teens 
to mid 30s 
mcpherson has used the 1987 ban on manufacture of threewheel 
allterrain vehicles blamed for nearly 1000 deaths and 300000 
injuries in five years as a club in his bid to regulate personal 
watercraft 
manufacturers first were kind of resistant to any 
legislation he said but he noted in conversations with industry 
representatives that threewheelers went by the wayside because 
they didnt have regulations and the same thing could happen to 
jet skis

in the arcane world of eastwest arms 
negotiations a public relations touch can be a powerful tool 
president bush will be trying to apply his own at the 40th 
anniversary nato summit opening in brussels on monday 
he has some catching up to do 
built into administration complaints about public relations 
ploys in soviet arms proposals is a tacit admission that mikhail s 
gorbachev has been using that american technique to americas 
disadvantage 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft acknowledged 
the importance of appearance when the administration offered an 
upbeat appraisal of new soviet proposals on conventional arms 
limits the president felt he appeared too negative before so 
hes trying to appear more positive now scowcroft said 
this is the presidents week to try to counter gorbachev to 
cast himself and the united states as the real peacemakers hes 
conferring with allied leaders in rome brussels bonn and london 
but reclaiming the initiative will take more imaginative 
gestures than his revived open skies arms verification proposal 
or the open ledgers idea he offered on wednesday 
with gorbachev piling theoretical troops tanks and missiles 
onto the negotiating table bush is left trying to explain a valid 
concern that even if those proposals come true the soviet side 
will still have a hefty margin in weapons and troops that is what 
the administration says must be balanced by natos battlefield 
nuclear weapons 
the white house insists that gorbachev is the one doing the 
responding that his arms reduction offers are in answers to 
proposals first made by the west 
the presidents men are trying to cast bush as the visionary 
leader the man whose themes and concepts will endure to reshape 
the world balance long after the soviet unions itemized proposals 
have been forgotten 
secretary of state james a baker iii said western values and 
principles are behind the changes occurring in the communist world 
were winning economically were winning politically we have 
the other philosophy acknowledging that it is a failure baker 
said so whatever were doing is working and for the time 
being i dont think we ought to say that were going to change 
that just for pr purposes 
but the gorbachev proposals are scoring public opinion points in 
western europe details and longterm merit notwithstanding even 
as bush called gorbachevs latest offer forthcoming and said it 
held promise for conventional force reductions he said it does not 
alter the need for western deterrence which means nuclear weapons 
in europe 
these reductions alone even if implemented are not enough to 
eliminate the significant numerical superiority that the soviet 
union enjoys right now the president said wednesday 
nevertheless bush has a problem not unlike the one he created 
for michael dukakis during the 1988 presidential campaign in those 
days bush was the one making catchy proposals and accusations 
leaving dukakis to struggle through the fine print as he tried to 
explain them away now in a different kind of campaign gorbachev 
has managed to do most of the soundbiting 
after gorbachevs offer to cut conventional arms bush came back 
with an accountants challenge i call on the soviets to do as we 
have always done lets open the ledgers publish an accurate 
defense budget 
open budgets openly arrived at is not a slogan likely to 
stir the western alliance 
ronald reagan knew the public relations side of the arms control 
balance and played to it 
a conservative candidate who had opposed arms limitation deals 
before he came to office reagan boosted the defense budget and 
took a hard line in early talks and at the same time he said that 
he wasnt satisfied with strategic arms limitation efforts that he 
wanted a strategic arms reduction treaty no more salt talks start 
talks later the zero option applied by treaty to intermediate 
range nuclear missiles that precedent is a problem now with the 
west germans pressing for immediate negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons and the administration wary of pressure to 
eliminate them too 
now gorbachev has the edge in moscowwashington public relations 
contest his proposals position the administration as the naysayer 
his offers come with such visual aids as flowers in red square on 
may day instead of glowering commissars reviewing missiles on 
parade 
bush warns that such soothing signs must be read with prudence 
the west is being tested by complacency he said 
baker said the united states needs to be seen as creative and 
forwardlooking in dealing with gorbachev and the changing soviet 
union but baker said that doesnt mean going into an arms 
control grab bag and competing with him on that score

avon products inc chairman james e preston 
says his 13yearold stepdaughter has come home from school in 
tears because of classmate taunts about cosmetics companies killing 
animals in lab tests 
he probably has felt similar emotions lately not only is avon a 
target of animal rights protests the company also is under intense 
pressure to improve its financial performance 
the pressure has been building since avon rejected a 21 
billion takeover proposal from amway corp a decision preston may 
live to regret if avon fails to achieve what some securities 
analysts are describing as highly optimistic sales and profit 
projections 
the beauty products giant known in past years for the slogan 
ding dong avon calling because of its whitegloved women 
doortodoor sales squads was putting the finishing touches on a 
radical make over when amways offer landed on its own doorstep 
earlier this month 
in response to the unwanted overture the management team led by 
preston huddled to plot a revised strategy aimed at justifying 
their determination to preserve avons independence 
preston during an interview in his office overlooking new 
yorks central park summed up the goal this way to run this 
business differently than its ever been run before 
put like that the task sounds simple judging by the critical 
questions preston fielded during a session to explain details of 
the plan to financial analysts however avon has a lot to prove 
to be fair avons harshest recent critics may be motivated more 
by their own desire for quick profits than byan interest in 
enhancing avons growth takeover stock speculators for instance 
lost money after buying avon shares on the hunch amways original 
39ashare offer might incite a bidding war 
but even those who respect prestons management and experience 
in the directselling business think he may have trouble keeping 
his promises 
its really a very aggressive game plan in which all the 
pieces of the puzzle have to fit exactly says andrew shore 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc theres no room for 
error everything has to go right if he doesnt hit these numbers 
clearly theres going to be a credibility problem 
shore who had been recommending purchase of avon shares based 
on the theory that expectations for the company were overly 
pessimistic says he is reassessing his rating 
among the new numbers that have evoked scepticism are 1989 
earnings per share from continuing operations of 230 to 240 on 
a fully diluted basis avon management now is forecasting 1990 
pershare earnings of at least 335 and at least 4 in 1991 
the estimates far exceed managements expectations circulated 
privately around the time of the companys annual shareholders 
meeting on may 4 
avon normally doesnt reveal projections it departed from usual 
practice in an attempt to persuade shareholders that management 
made the right decision in rebuffing amway a privately held 
company based in ada mich that sells products ranging from 
household cleaner to office supplies 
many observers say avon has been on the right trackfor several 
years and they applaud prestons pursuit of a higher profile for 
avons core beauty business avon has nearly completed the 
divestiture of its disappointing health care services holdings and 
preston has admitted it was a mistake for avon to have entered that 
business in the first place 
the transformation hasnt been altogether smooth despite 1988 
sales of 306 billion largely via 14 million independent sales 
representatives in the united states and more than 80 other 
countries avon lost 4045 million in losses on discontinued 
operations 
lauren l wong analyst with oppenheimer amp co inc credits 
prestonwith having the broad experience necessary for avon to 
maintain its ranking as the biggest us directselling company and 
a major supplier of beauty products 
preston 56 began his avon career in 1964 as a management 
trainee hes held positions in sales and marketing and 
international field operations as head of the beauty group 
starting in 1981 he steered the division out of a slump and 
visited sales representatives to learn their complaints 
his elevation to president and chief operating officer in may 
1988 came as a surprise because another avon executive john s 
chamberlin had been widely believed to be ahead of preston for the 
position 
preston was named chief executive officer in september 1988 and 
became chairman of the board in january of this year after hicks 
waldron retired 
one of the biggest questions about avons revised strategy is 
why the company has backed off its earlier higher predictions for 
overseas growth even after discounting the adverse impact of a 
stronger dollar the overseas estimates still are slightly below 
previous expectations 
most analysts consider foreign markets to offer the best 
opportunities for direct sellers 
wong of oppenheimer says it had been anticipated that sales 
outside the united states would outpace domestic sales but avon 
apparently has scaled back expansion plans abroad wong says the 
strategy could backfire by sacrificing future growth in favor of 
shortterm profits 
although avon seems to have discouraged amway for now observers 
dont think avon automatically can count on unchallenged 
independence especially if financial results dont meet its 
projections 
amway still owns a chunk of avon stock and could make another 
pitch some time to avons board takeover investor irwin jacobs 
also owns some avon shares mary kay corp the dallasbased 
cosmetics seller has expressed an interest in avon and speculation 
about other suitors has surfaced 
preston says numerous prospective buyers have approached him 
with particular interest in avons retail fragrance business 
consisting of some of the countrys most popular perfumes sold in 
department stores such as giorgio so far he says hes responded 
the same way to everybody the answer is not for sale 
while prestons fending off takeover feelers he also is trying 
to deflect criticism from one animal welfare group people for the 
ethical treatment of animals that doubts avons commitment to 
discontinuing the use of animals to screen the safety of its 
products 
the criticism is unfair says preston because avon has led the 
trend toward adopting nonanimal test methods and has donated money 
to researching alternatives 
of the animal rights group that has been picking on avon even 
protesting near prestons connecticut home preston says i want 
nothing to do with their confrontational style they have set back 
the animal rights movement

network crews are applauded by demonstrators in 
beijing well aware of the power of us television 
the chinese government similarly aware of that power shuts 
down live satellite transmissions to the united states in the heat 
of the demonstrations 
television brought the world the civil rights and antiwar 
movements of the 1960s the mass demonstrations in iran in the 
1970s the peoples uprising in the philippines in the 1980s as 
the yippies in chicago chanted 21 years ago the whole world is 
watching 
this time we might be at a turning point the chinese government 
pulled the plug on network transmissions but that didnt stop it 
you had this wonderful situation of american television 
feeding back information to the united states and chinese 
americans using everything from fax machines to telephones to feed 
information back to china said robert lichter of the 
washingtonbased center for media and public affairs which 
monitors the media this really illustrates the truism that free 
information is the enemy of authoritariansim because it undercuts 
the ability to control what people know 
we are finally really attaining the global village that 
marshall mcluhan had predicted now it really is possible for 
the whole world to be involved in social change anywhere in the 
globe as it happens and the only thing that can do is speed up 
the process 
the powerful hold press conferences the powerless hold 
demonstrations said berkeley sociology professor todd gitlin 
author of inside prime time and the sixties the media 
coverage isnt the only motive for the demonstrations but it does 
amplify what they do 
in the case of china the government miscalculated the effect of 
pulling the plug on american networks that only increased the 
coverage by 50 percent according to lichter 
on the other hand said lichter the coverage is less 
important in china than was in the philippines because the 
situation in china is less dependent on american public opinion 
deng has less to fear from television than marcos did since 
marcos counted on american support for his government 
nevertheless american living rooms have been filled the last 
two weeks with wrenchingly sympathetic scenes of courageous chinese 
students defying the government and going on hunger strikes in 
their quest for greater freedom dan rather called them these 
kids laying their lives on the line for democracy 
cnns bernard shaw recalled going through roadblocks in beijing 
people smiled and waved us on through and people were applauding 
us in tiananmen square its clear that people know who we are 
we meaning journalists being broadcast television radio or 
print photographers still or videotape they know the importance 
and the value of having us cover the story 
if the networks portray the chinese students as the scrappy 
freedomloving underdogs and the chinese government hardliners as 
bad guys they put themselves in the role of the cavalry 
it seemed the biggest event on american tv last week was the 
chinese governments act of unplugging network satellite 
transmissions the networks seemed to revel in the unusual 
confrontation with blatant repression especially cbs and cnn 
which had the pr advantage of having their most visible anchormen 
on the scene shaw and rather 
abc and nbc covered cnn being shut down cnn carried lengthy 
coverage of its own negotiations to stay on the air as did cbs 
14 minutes worth during the season finale of dallas 
we actually saw what happens when institutional authorities 
confront the media said gitlin we saw it unfolding in real 
time we saw these functionaries arrive from some chinese bureau 
we found them telling the cnn people to fold it up we saw the cnn 
guy on the phone to his boss in atlanta we saw that whole 
exchange i think we very rarely to see what happens when 
institutions are at work if the media did the same thing in the 
case of lots of other events then i think they would be doing a 
great deal to educate a democratic republic 
the rap on tv is that tv becomes the story said lichter 
but this is a story thats even bigger than dan rather i mean 
this is a story so big that the presence of tv i think doesnt 
really change it that much it just means were better informed 
than we would be if tv wasnt there 
gitlin recalls that the networks toned down their coverage of 
antiwar protests after the democratic convention in chicago in 
1968 out of fear they were amplifying the sense of dissension 
clearly when it comes to china theyre not concerned that they 
might be amplifying division its very clear to them who are the 
good guys and who are the bad guys 
part of the difficulty is its hard to find people who are 
defending the li peng hardline faction of the government said 
brokaw hes not available his spokesmen are not available the 
embassy here has clammed up and there are any number of people who 
are willing to be critical of repression and martial law so in 
that regard i suppose you could make the case that the coverage 
does appear to be sympathetic but thats because the events are 
sympathetic

real estate tycoon donald trump plans to spend 
millions of dollars to give his new trump shuttle the best of 
everything and may attempt to buy more assets of striketorn 
eastern airlines 
youre going to see the friendliest airline youre going to 
see the best managed airline there is trump said thursday i 
think the service is going to be fantastic 
the 365 million deal for the new yorkwashingtonboston shuttle 
should close in about two weeks and the airline should be operating 
as the new trump shuttle soon after he said 
we intend to have the best of everything trump told a news 
conference at his opulent plaza hotel in midtown manhattan 
trump also indicated a possible interest in buying other eastern 
assets such as more planes saying were looking at different 
elements of eastern 
trump shuttle president bruce nobles said trump hopes to capture 
75 percent of the shuttle market that is split with pan am corp 
after one year of operation but he called the target a little 
ambitious 
the shuttle is used mainly by business travelers and was 
easterns only consistently profitable operation before the march 4 
strike by its machinists which was joined by its pilots and flight 
attendants unions 
the eastern shuttle lost many passengers to pan ams rival 
shuttle because of the walkout and now has less than a 25 percent 
market share 
trump has pledged to upgrade the shuttle whose fleet of 21 
aging blueandsilver boeing 727s will be refurbished and painted 
with red black and gold stripes and trumps name on the tail 
were going to be spending millions of dollars on each 
plane trump said he also repeated a pledge to exceed federal 
regulations in checking each jet for safety 
im elated about it ive been unemployed for three months 
its a relief said bill sanford a striking eastern pilot from 
marietta ga who is one of 170 pilots tentatively hired by trump 
shuttle 
trump who owns several casinohotels in atlantic city nj 
also operates a helicopter service between new york and that resort 
city he said he is interested in possibly routing the shuttle to 
atlantic city on weekends 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland on thursday formally 
approved the sale to trump which followed withdrawal of a rival 
415 million buyout proposal from america west airlines which 
could not arrange financing 
miamibased eastern first agreed to sell trump the shuttle last

around 300 million from the shuttle sale after paying lease 
obligations and other related expenses 
eastern filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors march

easterns unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity but 
in addition to the shuttle sale easterns parent texas air corp 
has decided to sell about 14 billion in other assets separately

bethlehem steel corp says a doubling of 
productivity since steelworkers had their last wage increase in 
1982 helps take the sting out of its newly ratified labor contract 
while the united steelworkers union was counting ballots 
thursday bethlehems competitors were criticizing the contracts 
terms in washington at the annual conference of the american iron 
and steel institute 
by a margin of nearly 41 113863009 union members ratified 
a 50month package that raises average base wages by 250 per hour 
to 1372 by july 1993 
it was certainly rich enough ltv steel co president david 
hoag said thursday it covered a lot of things 
bethlehem steel chairman walter f williams said the added costs 
of the contract can be offset by a modest increase of 18 per ton 
in steel prices over the next four years bethlehems prices now 
average slightly more than 500 per ton he said 
i frankly dont understand how anyone could expect us not to 
have some increase in our labor costs after being flat for six 
years williams said 
national steel corp also is nearing a contract agreement with 
the usw an announcement could come as early as today on terms 
influenced by the bethlehem settlement according to sources who 
spoke on condition they not be identified 
contracts at national inland steel corp and armco inc expire 
july 31 the same deadline bethlehem faced 
the 20500 usw members at the nations secondlargest steelmaker 
won an immediate base wage increase of 1 per hour or 8 percent 
to 1222 an hour as a restoration of past sacrifices the base 
wage will rise by 1 on jan 1 1991 and by 50 cents on jan 1 
1992 
they get an immediate 500 signing bonus and a 500 advance on 
profitsharing payments pension and medical benefits will be 
sweetened and three paid holidays and sunday premium pay will be 
restored over the contract life 
increased payments early in the contract are mostly obligations 
from earlier sacrifices and the workers will not see new money 
until 1991 williams said 
usx corp executive vice president j bruce johnston formerly 
chief labor negotiator for the entire steel industry called the 
bethlehem agreement unfortunate one steel executive speaking 
privately called the terms tragic 
the hourly increases amount to 46 percent per year and prices 
would have to increase only 38 percent per year to offset the new 
costs one analyst said 
depending on inflation and profitsharing the new contract 
could raise the companys average labor costs from around 2650 
per hour now to 3160 per hour when it expires in july 31 1993 
according to studies 
industrywide labor costs averaged 2456 per hour in 1988 
according to the aisi 
williams said the pact also provides for plantlevel 
negotiations to streamline work rules and further improve 
productivity 
productivity has roughly doubled since 1982 lessening the 
impact of labor costs on total production costs he said the 
company can produce a ton of steel with the equivalent of one man 
working four hours thats down from around 8 manhours per ton six 
years ago

californias chief educator says he will 
withhold state funds from schools that show an experimental 
television news program for teenagers that includes a daily dose 
of commercials 
the creators of channel one want to offer the 12minuteaday 
show to schools nationwide providing satellite dishes television 
sets and video recorders in exchange for a guarantee students will 
watch the program daily 
but bill honig californias superintendent of public education 
said thursday he would withhold some state money from public 
schools that agree to accept the show billed by its makers as an 
innovative educational tool 
mandatory viewing of ads runs counter to state law defining 
schools educational mission he said 
honig cannot order local school districts to ban the show but 
his control of state funds for education gives him considerable 
influence 
honig said channel one a forprofit venture by whittle 
communications of knoxville tenn would in effect put teachers 
and school administrators in the position of endorsing commercial 
products 
the whole reason for this is to have access to kids minds 
our youngsters minds honig said we would be ceding control 
of our curriculum to a commercial enterprise 
whittle which tested the teenoriented news show in six schools 
across the country this spring said company lawyers have checked 
california law and disagree with honigs interpretation 
to come out and reject something thats not even in existence 
seems to us to be a little bit premature whittle spokesman david 
jarrard said 
teachers who took part in the test screenings have given the 
show rave reviews but several mainstream educational 
organizations including the national parentteacher association 
and the national association of secondary school principals oppose 
widespread adoption of channel one 
the shows youthful newscasters present the events of the day 
with an emphasis on how they affect teens it runs 10 minutes plus 
two minutes of ads for blue jeans candy hamburgers and other 
products 
in exchange for a guarantee students will watch the show daily 
each school gets a satellite tv dish to receive channel one and 
other programs a video recorder and a color television set for 
each participating classroom the package is valued at 50000 per 
school 
honig would block channel one from the states 45 million 
students by using his authority over state grants that are made to 
individual schools on the basis of attendance 
if every highschool student in the state watched channel one 
grants for the time spent would amount to 298 million honig said

the bush administration will address barriers 
to exports of us autos even though cars arent expressly on an 
official list of products subject to unfair trade restrictions 
sen donald riegle says 
the longawaited list announced thursday targets trade 
barriers in japan brazil and india to fulfill a new us trade law 
in a move that could mean huge tariffs against some foreign 
products 
riegle dmich played a key role in placing the new provision 
known as super 301 in the trade bill passed last year the law 
requires the administration to identify the most harmful trade 
barriers and gives the administration 18 months to negotiate the 
removal of the barriers 
the list of harmful trade practices in japan named satellites 
supercomputers and forest products as areas that had suffered from 
japanese trading practices it omitted the automotive sector which 
accounts for almost twothirds of the 55 billion us trade 
imbalance with japan 
but riegle aides said the inclusion of distribution systems on 
the agenda ensured automotive issues would be addressed in 
negotiations with tokyo on trade barriers built into the japanese 
regulatory and marketing system closed distribution is one of the 
greatest barriers the industry faces to entry into the japanese 
market 
the super 301 process is having the effect i intended when it 
was written riegle said while other countries could and 
should be listed this initial list is a key step forward 
chrysler corp the nations third largest automaker said in a 
statement it was encouraged that distribution systems in japan were 
included on the tradeimbalance list 
chrysler will over the next 12 months aggressively attempt 
to fulfill its commitment to break into the japanese market as we 
have in europe and taiwan the company said 
if we are not successful in cracking this market we will 
still have the option to refile for super 301 designation of auto 
distribution as a priority practice chrysler said 
if administration talks fail to produce results in 18 months 
the government can levy tariffs of up to 100 percent against 
selected imports from an offending country 
automobiles and auto parts are not on the formal list and so 
would not come under the 18month rule 
the list had its critics including nobuo matsunaga the 
japanese ambassador to the united states 
in light of the goodfaith efforts that have been made the 
government of japan and the japanese people are greatly 
disappointed by this onesided decision matsunaga said in a news 
release there may well be some domestic backlash in japan which 
will make the resolution of the various problems even more 
difficult

decision upholding universals shareholder rights plan 
terrence m oreilly vice president and general counsel for 
universal said thursday that the offer by amanda acquisition 
corp a high voltage subsidiary formed for the acquisition of 
universal could not proceed after the court decision 
amandas offer for universal cannot proceed in light of its 
defeat in the 7th circuit court of appeals in chicago oreilly 
said amandas counsel told the court of appeals that if the 
wisconsin business combination statute were upheld its takeover 
offer would be doomed the court relied on the statement in 
disposing of the case

an investor group including mary kay cosmetics 
inc says it wants to acquire rival avon products inc which last 
week rejected a 21 billion takeover bid from amway corp 
john p rochon vice chairman of mary kay corp parent of the 
cosmetics company late thursday made public a letter to avon 
saying the investor group has had talks with avon about a possible 
takeover 
no figures were mentioned in the letter which was sent to avon 
chairman james e preston 
avon spokesman john cox said the company would have no comment 
on mary kays interest at least until after the matter was 
discussed at a regularly scheduled board meeting on june 1 in 
response to amways offer preston stated that avon wasnt for sale 
the letter said mary kay and avon each would maintain separate 
sales forces and identities if an acquisition were successful 
on wednesday stock speculators bid avon shares higher following 
a report that the cosmetics company may be the target of a hostile 
takeover attempt 
we have never before publicly disclosed either our interest in 
avon or the fact or content of any of the discussions we or our 
financial advisors the first boston corp have had with avon or 
its advisors the letter said 
however because recent press accounts involving avon referred 
to mary kay cosmetics the company now feels it necessary to advise 
the people who are key to its success its sales force of the 
nature of its interest in avon rochon said 
if a bid were successful avon would be directed by argonaut 
partners an investment arm of mary kay cosmetics rochon said he 
said mary kay sales directors were notified about the interest in 
avon on thursday 
on wednesday following a usa today report that investor irwin 
l jacobs and an unidentified major company planned to launch a 
joint bid for avon at 40 a share avon stock soared on the new 
york stock exchange in heavy trading 
avon dropped 75 cents to 3512 in composite nyse trading 
thursday after gaining 137 the previous day

were in the process of completing financing and other details of 
the hostile offer jacobs partner was said to be a company other 
than mary kay 
amway last week was rebuffed by avon in a 39ashare takeover 
offer that valued avon at 21 billion

japan angrily refused today to negotiate to avoid 
trade sanctions under terms set by the united states and tokyo 
said it may haul washington into international trade court 
the united states on thursday named japan brazil and india as 
unfair traders that must negotiate to remove barriers within 18 
months or face possible sanctions including tariffs of up to 100 
percent on selected goods 
india joined japan in criticizing the us action commerce 
minister dinesh singh said it was totally unjustified irrational 
and unfair 
the japanese foreign ministry summoned us ambassador michael 
armacost today to explain the governments position said ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe 
the government of japan has no intention of entering into 
negotiations with the united states under the conditions imposed 
under super 301 hiroshi mitsuzuka minister of international 
trade and industry said in a statement 
super 301 refers to the provision of the 1988 us omnibus 
trade act allowing the united states to target countries and 
practices that block american exports 
the european community and japan and other countries have said 
the unilateral nature of the us law may violate the provisions of 
the international general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
if sanctions are imposed under super 301 japan may bring a 
complaint before gatt which is supposed to help resolve trade 
disputes watanabe said 
watanabe was not as confrontational as mitsuzuka however 
although japan will not negotiate under terms of the us law it 
may propose quiet talks and joint cooperation that may 
coincide with the negotiations washington demands watanabe 
said 
foreign minister sousuke uno called the us action extremely 
regrettable and said it was designed to draw attention away from 
a large source of the trade imbalance the us budget deficit 
as a result of many marketopening measures that have been 
taken to date the japanese market has now become a widely open 
market uno told reporters 
the us itself maintains import restrictive measures and 
practices to a considerable degree he said 
japan was targeted for unfair trade practices in supercomputers 
satellites and lumber 
but officials cited increases in japanese purchases of us 
goods and expressed anger at us charges of unfairness 
japan is launching five us communications and broadcasting 
satellites this year which proves our satellite market is open 
to foreign companies said posts and telecommunications minister 
seiichi kataoka 
the united states charges that japans policy of encouraging a 
domestic space industry prohibits the purchase of foreign 
satellites if they interfere with indigenous development 
objectives effectively limiting us access to the market 
japan will buy eight us supercomputers within three years the 
government announced earlier this month 
the united states says that through a variety of exclusionary 
practices japan has thwarted the open procurement process of 
supercomputers 
the us statement also said brazils import licensing system 
inhibits market access and creates uncertainty for us 
exporters it criticized india for requiring government approval 
of all new or expanded foreign investment 
dinesh indias commerce ministerm said washington had no right 
to blame his country for blocking us imports when the united 
states does the same thing with indian imports 
the united states action is particularly surprising because 
the us itself has built and retained a variety of barriers 
against access to its markets it is hardly in a position to ask 
others to lift barriers without doing so itself dinesh said in a 
statement 
the united states has a trade deficit of about 700 million with 
india and a 52 billion deficit with japan 
last year india exported 32 billion in goods to the united 
states and us exports to indian was about 25 billion

president bush urging japan brazil and india 
to open their markets to us products said today that 
negotiations aimed at ending unfair trade practices will begin with 
the three countries on june 16 
the japanese trade minister declared however that his 
government would refuse to take part in such talks under duress 
the administration singled out the three nations thursday night 
for priority action under a 1988 trade law that calls for penalties 
against countries that are deemed to be especially protectionist 
our goal is to open markets and to eliminate trade barriers 
we oppose protectionism in any and all forms therefore i urge the 
governments of japan india and brazil to work constructively with 
us to resolve these issues expeditiously the president said in a 
statement announcing the negotiation date as he left on a trip to 
europe 
the 1988 omnibus trade act requires the administration to issue 
what amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose trade 
barriers are most harmful to american producers the government 
then has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers 
failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of up to 100 percent 
on selected exports from the offending countries 
announcing the action us trade representative carla a hills 
told reporters this exercise is not intended to be offensive i 
hope there is no backlash 
however japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga issued a statement 
calling the decision to include his country extremely 
regrettable 
in tokyo hiroshi mitsuzuka minister of international trade and 
industry said in a statement the government of japan has no 
intention of entering into negotiations with the united states 
under the conditions imposed in the law 
taizo watanabe spokesman for the japanese foreign ministry was 
less emphatic saying that while japan will not negotiate under 
terms of the law it may propose quiet talks and joint 
cooperation that may coincide with the negotiations 
washington wants 
india joined japan in criticizing the us action commerce 
minister dinesh singh said it was totally unjustified irrational 
and unfair 
hills also announced the united states would be watching closely 
25 countries suspected of failing to protect us copyrights and 
patents and said the bush administration would reveal the status of 
the eight most flagrant ones in november 
the japanese lobbied in recent weeks to stay off the list of top 
trade violators they were less successful however than the 
koreans who made a number of trade concessions in recent days and 
did manage to avoid inclusion 
in light of the good faith efforts that have been made the 
government of japan and the japanese people are greatly 
disappointed by this onesided decision matsunaga said there 
may well be some domestic backlash in japan which will make the 
resolution of the various problemseven more difficult 
japan was cited for its refusal to buy us supercomputers and 
satellites as well as its barriers to purchase of us wood 
products the united states ran a trade deficit of 52 billion last 
year with japan or 44 percent of the 1198 billion us trade 
imbalance 
india was cited for barriers that bar foreign investment and the 
closing of its insurance market to foreign companies 
the administration cited brazil for quotas on imports and 
licensing restrictions 
hills said the administration plans to immediately commence 
negotiations on all of this that we have identified but added 
that there was no certainty that they could succeed 
i have no assurance she said i have only my own good 
will and i hope we can approach these negotiations with a 
constructive dialogue 
besides citing japan brazil and india for flagrant trade 
barriers the administration placed eight countries on a priority 
watch list of nations that have failed to protect us copyrights 
and patents it declined however to target any countries for 
priority action on that issue 
it did establish a lesser watch list of 17 other countries 
that have not established safeguards against infringement on us 
copyrights and patents 
the president also has directed cabinet officials to open 
separate negotiations with the japanese on eliminating structural 
impediments to sales of us goods within their economy the 
impediments range from pricing mechanisms to bid rigging 
in his statement today bush said us officials looked at a 
large number of practices that ultimately were not listed 
including japanese rice quotas and the subsidies given by the 
european community to the manufacturers of airbus airliners he 
said it was felt they could be better addressed through existing 
international trade forums 
on capitol hill senate sponsors of the trade law reacted 
favorably to the administrations action 
i expect well hear howls of outrage from both sides on this 
claims the action was either rash or timid senate finance 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said in a statement 
bentsen called the move only a first step but an important one 
in establishing an effective trade policy weve let the world 
know where our priorities lie when it comes to opening markets 
sen john c danforth rmo called the action a very 
positive first step and sen max baucus dmont said i think 
the administration deserves a passing grade they are stepping up 
to the problem 
elsewhere in congress however voices of dissent suggested that 
the administration had not gone far enough 
sen carl levin dmich said he was disappointed that 
hills left off so many other unfair japanese trade practices from 
the list including auto parts and construction services 
rep sander levin dmich said the decision is more a 
compromise among factions within the administration than a clear 
message to our trading partners and a clear policy for america 
the presidents chief economic adviser michael boskin and 
budget director richard darman had argued strenuously that 
targeting japan would do more harm than good while hills and 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher called for a tough crackdown 
danforth told reporters however he saw nothing unusual about 
disagreement within an administration before such a decision 
sen don riegle dmich said the targeting of japan showed 
that the trade law is beginning to produce important results 
ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
called the plan a positive first step toward dismantling foreign 
trade barriers 
countries named to the priority watch list for patents and 
copyrights were brazil india korea mexico china saudi arabia 
taiwan and thailand 
additional countries named to what the administration described 
as a less urgent watch list were argentina canada chile 
columbia egypt greece indonesia italy japan malaysia 
pakistan the philippines portugal spain turkey venezuela and 
yugoslavia

ford motor co said today it will halt 
production temporarily at two plants to shrink inventories of its 
escort subcompact car last years most popular automobile 
ford spokesman ray windecker said production at the companys 
edison nj plant stopped monday and is to resume june 5 on that 
date the companys plant in wayne mich will stop production for 
a week 
the two plants are the only ones making the escort ford has 
about a 100day supply of escorts at the current selling rate 
windecker said 
the shutdowns are the first in six years in which ford has 
closed any plant to reduce inventory plants typically shut down in 
late summer to retool for the next model year 
in 1988 ford sold 387815 escorts making it the most popular 
vehicle behind ford and chevrolet pickup trucks through may 20 of 
this year escorts were selling at a pace 51 percent behind last 
years 
ford has about 1500 workers at the edison plant and about 3000 
at the wayne plant 
the subcompact market is running below expectations 
windecker said 
ford officials said in april that an average of 10 percent to 15 
percent of the cars it sells are built on overtime in the past 
ford has reduced inventories of specific models by slowing the 
assembly line or trimming overtime that strategy failed with the 
escort

many investors may be celebrating the stock 
markets recent comeback but theres little to shout about for 
people who bet on the securities industry itself 
share prices of most publicly held investment firms 
particularly those that do a large amount of their business with 
the public linger far below their peaks earlier in the 1980s 
for example merrill lynch around 30 last week is trading for 
barely half its 1983 high of 5650 
salomon inc a preeminent investment banker stood recently 
around 26 vs a high just three years ago of 5950 
the stock of charles schwab corp the largest of the discount 
brokers has rallied from a postcrash 575 to 1175 as of late 
last week thats still quite a way short however of the 1650 
price it commanded when it was first offered to the public in 
september of 1987 
theres no mystery about all this to regular readers of the 
financial pages while stock prices have risen sharply in the past 
six months most sources of brokers income remain depressed 
individual investors are still wary or just plain turned off 
competition for business from investing institutions has shaved 
commissions on their trades razorthin 
continued sluggishness in capital and consumer market 
activity combined with a barrage of negative articles in the press 
concerning the nearterm outlook for the brokerage business has 
kept pressure on the brokerage stocks said lawrence eckenfelder 
an analyst who follows the industry for prudentialbache securities 
for firms such as merrill lynch and painewebber eckenfelder 
observed in his current monthly report on the group the story is 
still the same 
in order for earnings to move upward in a meaningful way from 
current levels the retail business must gain momentum 
the value line investment survey which has just published its 
quarterly appraisal of the securities industry ranks it 83rd out 
of 92 groups it follows for likely stockprice performance over the 
next 12 months 
ever since the stock market collapsed in october 1987 trading 
volume has been severely depressed the investment advisory 
service observed 
but at least among the big wall street firms mergers and 
acquisitions and the hefty fees they bring in have been picking 
up the slack 
now some wariness has set in will congress limit the size of 
buyouts will rising interest rates make haevy debt burdens too 
risky 
although there arent yet any definitive answers to these 
questions merger and acquisition activity has been on the back 
burner since the start of the year in the first quarter for 
example the number of transactions dropped 30 percent from the 
yearago quarter and dollar volume fell 58 percent 
many companies report there are enough deals in the pipeline 
so that second quarter results should show an increase but at this 
point were not expecting 1989 to catch up to 1988 
a telling gauge of the state of wall street is the price of a 
seat or membership at the new york stock exchange on may 9 a 
seat changed hands for 500000 less than half the precrash 
record of 115 million 
seat prices have a volatile history in line with the 
boombust cycles that regularly recur in the securities business 
noted john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc in a recent 
commentary 
in 1977 times were so bad that an nyse seat sold for 35000 
or slightly less than the price of a new york city taxi medallion 
for those who insist that history must repeat itself we would 
note that cab medallions are bid at 140000

atampt and its unions today reported progress in 
their contract talks with the company amending its benefits 
package and the unions making a number of counter offers as the 
saturday expiration of current pacts drew closer 
theres been a lot more movement today than there was 
thursday communications workers of american spokeswoman 
francine zucker said i think were going to get very close and 
we may reach a settlement but that can change quickly 
still to be resolved are major differences over wages and a 
company demand that workers pay more for health care 
we are not as far apart as we were but were nowhere near 
where we want to be ms zucker said 
the company moving to answer some of the unions jobsecurity 
concerns amended its contract offer to include limits on the use 
of temporary workers an atampt spokeswoman said 
the company also proposed several changes to its benefits 
package spokeswoman edith herman said as negotiators for the 
company and two unions continued talks aimed at reaching a new 
contract before current pacts for about 160000 workers expire 
saturday 
ms herman could not provide specifics of the new company 
proposals but said american telephone amp telegraph was offering to 
regulate the use of temporary help improvements to its eye and 
dental care programs a more liberal leave policy to care for 
newborn babies and a new leave program to care for sick relatives 
ms zucker said those proposals were being reviewed and that the 
unions likely would make counter offers later today 
on thursday the unions renewed their attack on atampts health 
care proposal which would shift some costs to employers but leave 
in place existing caps on the maximum they would have to pay in a 
given year 
atampt spends megabucks urging americans to reach out and call 
our relatives to make sure theyre ok but the only reaching the 
company is doing is into its employees pockets international 
brotherhood of electrical workers president jack barry said as the 
unions accused atampt of withholding data on its medical care costs 
but an atampt spokesman said the company had produced most of the 
information requested by the unions and was in the process of 
compiling the rest 
despite the public optimism both sides are making extensive 
preparations for a strike union leaders have hinted they will not 
call a walkout immediately but likely would do so if an agreement 
is not reached within a week or so after the contracts expire 
a strike remains a weapon but it is a weapon of last resort 
ms zucker said 
atampt from its new jersey operations center is preparing 
management emergency teams to fill in for striking workers if 
there is a walkout and the company has plans in place to complete 
all major business installations scheduled for the next five weeks 
spokesman herb linnen said 
linnen said the breakdown of the workers represented by the 
unions was 
21500 longdistance operators 
35500 field and inhouse technicians 
about 37000 production workers in factories that make 
longdistance switching and transmission equipment the area of 
atampt operations likely to be hit hardest in the event of a strike 
its pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picket lines 
are being honored on a high percentage basis said linnen who 
said the plants would be kept open nonetheless 
about 54000 other union workers in jobs ranging from clerical 
administrative and sales staff to sales representatives in atampt 
retail sales outlets 
atampts manufacturing of residential phones is done in singapore 
and would not be affected by a strike inventory for the equipment 
manufactured in the united states is sparse linnen said 
linnen sad management personnel would fill in for strikers 
however he would not provide a breakdown of how they would be 
assigned 
in the event of a strike customers who directly dial 
longdistance calls should experience no significant service 
problems but those needing operator assistance could face delays 
at peak hours union and company officials said 
atampt which holds about 70 percent of the longdistance market 
handles about 80 million calls on a normal business day 
ms zucker said during a 26day cwa strike in 1986 some of the 
managers who replaced operators proved they could do the job 
others did not they are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliar 
jobs and the added stress would have an impact on the quality of 
service

t boone pickens says he will take his 
fight for representation on koito manufacturing cos board to the 
annual meeting of the japanese auto parts manufacturer 
theres no doubt they dont want an american on the inside 
pickens said thursday weve made it clear that boone co intends 
to be a longterm holder but im getting the impression management 
and its friends have something to hide 
the takeover strategist who has sought a seat on the board 
since his boone co became the companys largest single shareholder 
with 202 percent of the outstanding stock complained that on 
wednesday koito granted a matsushita electric industrial co 
representative a seat on the board although the japanese company 
has just 53 percent of the stock 
pickens requested three seats on the board the same number held 
by toyota motor co which has 192 percent of stock in koito 
he said in a statement the denial is sending a clear signal by 
japans major corporations that they have no respect or interest in 
american investors 
spokesman mark helmke said the company had first tried to limit 
pickens to sending only one person to the meeting but has since 
agreed to allow him two people so he can bring an interpreter 
but helmke said he expected pickens will try to attend the 
meeting with his partners in boone co 
i see nothing wrong with toyota or any other japanese company 
investing in the united states pickens said but i also 
believe investment has to be a twoway street in todays global 
economy no country can afford to keep other investors and other 
manufacturers out for long 
if japans corporate leaders dont open up japan is going to 
get left behind and i doubt the japanese public will stand for 
that for too long 
since pickens acquired his stake in koito he has been urging 
government action to force japan to open its doors to foreign 
investment 
helmke said pickens is encouraged by the bush administrations 
decision thursday to include japan on a list of countries who trade 
practices are most harmful to the us economy

the man who helped transform americas 
cornfields and pastures into the phenomenon known as the shopping 
mall says he is upbeat about the future of his industry and the 
economy 
melvin simon who started in the shopping center game 30 years 
ago by leasing launderettes and developing small centers anchored 
by discount stores launches his most ambitious project in june 
with groundbreaking for the mall of america he says the 
bloomington minn mall will be americas largest big enough to 
include its own enclosed theme park 
simons giant new 42 million squarefoot mall of america was 
one of the star attractions at the international council of 
shopping centers convention in las vegas it shared billing with 
other major simon properties including a major project he will be 
developing in france and a look at the unique renovation of the old 
gimbels building in new yorks famed herald square 
im very upbeat about the economy simon said as he stood in 
front of his companys booth at the annual conclave for shopping 
center developers builders and retailers everything goes in 
cycles but i feel excited about the future you dont lease a 
center depending on todays economy but on what the future holds 
the glass is half filled 
how many shopping centers does indianapolisbased melvin simon amp 
associates own or manage 
simon turns to an employee standing at his side hes either 
lost track or is testing the employee 
we have 207 centers in 38 states the employee responds 
simon smiles 
the numbers make simon one of the largest managers and 
developers of us shopping centers 
not bad for the brooklynborn bronxraised son of a tailor who 
chose to stay in indianapolis after a tour of military duty there 
he convinced brother herbert to join him in selling space for an 
indianapolis shopping center developer and in 1960 started his own 
company 
today melvin simon 62 is chairman of the company that bears 
his name and herbert 53 is president melvin simon owns 
twothirds of his company and forbes magazine estimates his fortune 
at 550 million herbert owns onethird with a fortune estimated 
at 270 million 
melvin simon says hes always believed centers should be more 
than just a place to shop 
mall of america he says will be witness to that theory 
grand opening is scheduled for the fall of 1992 built on the 
site of the old metropolitan stadium it will include four major 
anchors 800 specialty stores 18 theaters and camp snoopy 
the latter will be a 300000squarefoot theme family 
entertainment park created and operated by knotts berry farm of 
buena park calif the park alone will cost 70 million 
phase i of the project will cost 600 million and will cover 78 
acres included will be a golf course and parking space to 
accommodate 13000 vehicles an area the size of 96 football 
fields 
plans call for developing as much as 95 million square feet of 
space at mall of america including hotels and office space the 
minnesota project is a joint venture with triple five corporation 
of west edmonton alberta triple five pioneered the megamall 
concept with its 52 million squarefoot west edmonton mall 
another project coming on line for the simons this year will be 
aamps plaza in manhattan a 400 million renovation of the old 
gimbels building a glass wall on the avenue of the americas side 
will give pedestrians a view of dozens of stores on seven levels 
to date the company has developed 11 million square feet of 
shopping center space and manages 723 million with 4450 
employees nationwide including 1004 in their indianapolis 
headquarters 
currently the company is adding about three major malls and 
eight to 10 smaller centers a year to its inventory 
today the company normally doesnt get into a project without 
owning it either outright or in partnership such as the case of 
mall of america 
we like to keep them and see them grow so we become part of 
the community herbert simon said 
community involvement is something the simons are known for in 
indianpolis 
when the indiana pacers appeared ready to exit the city the 
simons shelled out 13 million for the pro basketball club keeping 
them there 
they saved a major downtown indianapolis landmark by undertaking 
a 6 million renovation of the roof ballroom where thousands of 
indianapolis citizens had held proms and weddings 
their company will be spending 840 million on circle centre an 
effort to remodel and revitalize much of downtown indianapolis 
melvin simon also has tried his hand at the movies producing 
films such as zorro the gay blade and porkys 
other major simon projects include 
hollywood promenade a planned hotel and shopping complex 
developed around manns chinese theater 
newport centre a 12 million squarefoot project in jersey 
city nj that includes shopping and residental areas 
fashion centre at pentagon city a 860000 squarefoot complex 
at arlington va that includes a 450room hotel shopping and 
office space 
abroad meanwhile the brothers are joining with a french 
consortium to build a 270acre leisure retail convention and 
trade center known as europark in nice france work is scheduled 
to begin next year 
figures released at the icsc convention held in late may show 
were were 32560 us shopping centers in 1988 up from 30600 the 
previous year those centers generated 627 billion in retail 
sales up from 586 billion in 1987

in the past two decades the united states has 
corrected many of the problems that had weakened its international 
competitiveness to the point that entire industries were lost to 
upstarts 
major manufacturers modernized factories raised quality 
reintroduced the work ethic cut whitecollar bureaucracies 
learned how to export government regulators loosened up and tax 
incentives were introduced 
but while america can take bows for having learned from history 
and taken action to correct its defects it has a long way to go 
beginning perhaps with the trade and budget deficits and the 
factors underlying them 
while those items are in the news every day and something is 
being done about them several other problems of great importance 
lie dormant ready to spring up like jacks in the box 
there is for instance the massive question of guiding the 
economy 
the federal reserves faithful weapon against emerging inflation 
is to clamp down on the money supply thus putting upward pressure 
on interest rates it is an effective tool but many critics see it 
as a bludgeon not a scalpel 
for example one of the indicators of inflation used by the fed 
is capacity utilization by the nations factories when that 
percentage reaches 85 as it almost did earlier this year 
inflation is said to be a real threat 
whatever capacity exists beyond that point is thought to be less 
efficient less efficient production is more costly production and 
more costly production forces industry to raise its prices to 
buyers 
the feds approach has been to lessen demand on the factories by 
raising interest rates high enough to discourage buyers slack is 
created and the least efficient facilities can be retired from use 
wait a minute say the critics wont higher interest rates cut 
into the capital commitments necessary to increase capacity 
wouldnt it be wiser of the fed to see if it could create slack by 
encouraging growth in capacity 
big questions but little is ever done about them some critical 
economists and business people have been arguing the position for 
decades to no avail 
also without resolution probably to remain so until another 
crisis is the oil conflict are americans willing to pay higher 
prices for oil ask the question anywhere and the answer is a 
unanimous no 
but americans also are becoming reattracted to bigger cars 
relations with oilproducing nations such as iran are tenuous 
and nobody gets more outraged at ecological damage than do 
americans 
the nation has no official position on this enormous economic 
threat which can become a sudden reality because of military 
actions oil spills platform explosions or opec decisions 
just as oil can break the economy health care could also when 
lives are involved it is difficult to apply cost restraints 
especially in a profession where the ethic is to do everything 
possible to maintain or improve life 
attempts to impose business discipline on and by providers of 
health care insurers and users have helped but the problem 
remains an aging population rising healthcare wages and 
scientific equipment contribute mightily 
because of these and other factors health care remained in an 
inflationary mode throughout the 1980s even while general 
inflation receded to under 5 percent and there is little prospect 
for controlling that inflation 
housing for the poor belongs in the same category of problems 
a variety of factors have driven up housing prices important 
among them being a spurt in land costs community restrictions and 
environmental concerns these are among the costs passed on to 
buyers who can afford them 
housing for the poor however has never been profitable without 
government assistance in one form or another tax benefits have 
been used effectively in the past as have relaxation of zoning or 
other inhibitions to building 
those tax benefits however were greatly reduced in the tax 
reformation of 1986 no longer is it profitable or as profitable 
for investors to put their money into massive construction projects 
thus while singlefamily home construction has remained strong 
building of multifamily dwellings has plunged if anything the 
housing situation for the poor has deteriorated rather than 
improved

unlike beer guzzlers who dash off to 
the store for quick gratification lawrence snyders customers are 
willing to wait up to eight weeks to savor their favorite brew 
snyder owns brew and wine hobby in east hartford where beer 
aficionados can buy everything from the hops malts and barley to 
the siphons containers and bottles needed to brew their own beer 
it spoils you forever and commercial beers never taste the 
same again snyder said 
his store where 25 brands of malt share space with beer mixes 
from around the world is one of perhaps 1200 across the country 
catering to the growing number of americans who prefer their own 
brew to commercial lagers ales and stouts according to the 
american homebrewers association in boulder colo 
there is some work involved but the satisfaction you get in 
the end is worth it said everett stone a computer analyst and 
snyder customer who has been brewing his own since 1982 you can 
give it your own personal touch 
homebrewing has only been legal in the united states since 
1979 a survey commissioned by boots of england a british 
drugstore chain found there were about 14 million homebrewers in 
the united states as of 1984 the last figures available 
homebrewers produce an average 45 gallons or two cases of beer 
a month and spend about 250 a year on supplies statistics 
compiled by the homebrewers association show 
snyder who admits that he actually prefers homemade wine to 
beer got into the homebrewing business by accident he had lost 
his job as an english professor and happened to be in the store 
buying some winemaking equipment for his own hobby when the owner 
offered him a job as manager in 1972 
the next year he bought out the owner a pratt amp whitney 
engineer who operated the store as a lucrative hobby snyder added 
homebrewing supplies after it became legal 
the brewing process from initial boiling to final bottling and 
aging takes six to eight weeks 
it begins with the mixing of malt and boiling water for between 
15 minutes for light beer or an hour for the heavier darker stouts 
next comes a fivetoseven day fermentation process when yeast 
is added to convert sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide alcohol 
content depends on how long it ferments 
the homebrew is then siphoned from the primary container to a 
secondary one where it remains until bottling 
prior to bottling the homebrew is primed when sugar is added 
to help produce carbonation after bottling the homebrew must age 
two to four weeks before it is ready to drink 
daniel bradford marketing director for the american homebrewers 
association said homebrewing has become painless with the 
introduction of canned ingredients imported from europe that allow 
homebrewers to duplicate their favorite import such as a john 
bull lager or a tom caxton scottish ale 
supplies are readily available and directions have been 
debugged so thoroughly they are foolproof bradford said 
bradford says increased interest in homebrewing also stems from 
renewed emphasis on homemade products 
people are interested in cocooning doing things at home 
and you can see that in the increased interest in gardening 
bradford said the increased interest in gardening is somewhat 
analogous to homebrewing 
some homebrewers say they were drawn to their hobby as much by 
their wallets as their palates a can of john bull lager mix can 
produce five gallons of beer or about twoandahalf cases for as 
little as a 110 a sixpack imported beers retail for between 1 
and 2 a bottle 
my motivation was that english beer is difficult to come by 
in the united states and it is expensive said mick a cogdon 
of enfield conn a 39yearold sales representatives with 
homebrewing you can keep the alcohol down which lowers calories 
and means you can drink more 
snyder said many customers choose homebrew over such homemade 
products as wine because it is quicker and easier to make it is 
also a yearround hobby while the winemaking season runs from 
september to november 
first of all were a beerdrinking society and we want instant 
gratification or at least in the not too distant future snyder 
said wine is very seasonal and takes more skill to make and 
requires a longer aging process

japanese telecommunications giant nippon telegraph 
and telephone corp said friday its earnings fell last year as it 
faced the fiercest competition it has seen since becoming a private 
business 
ntt which began its conversion from a government monoply to 
private ownership four years ago posted a 52 percent decline in 
net income and a 143 percent drop in unconsolidated pretax profits 
for the fiscal year ended march 31 
company officials attributed the drop in profits to lower 
longdistance revenue caused by competition from new entrants in 
the market and to a slump in revenue from data communications 
services 
it said its net income fell to 2306 billion yen or 18 
billion while pretax profits dropped to 4259 billion yen or 
328 billion from 4967 billion yen the previous year 
total operating revenue fell 02 percent to 565 trillion yen 
or 4348 billion the company said 
fiscal 1989 was really the initial year of real competition in 
the market for the first three years after privatization we 
continued to enjoy monopoly status because our competitors had not 
yet started to offer services said osamu kajima deputy manager 
of the accounting department at a news conference 
as japans largest company ntt has attracted international 
attention in the course of its transformation from government 
monopoly to semiprivate company over the past four years 
the company was a stock market star in 1987 when the first 
portion of its stock was offered to the public in april 1987 two 
months after the stock was offered a single share of the company 
was worth 318 million yen the equivalent of about 24100 
twentyfive percent of shares have been offered on the market 
with the government still holding the remainder 
but recently the company has fallen on hard times its 
harddriving chairman hisashi shinto resigned last december after 
being implicated in the recruit scandal and was arrested in march 
on bribery charges 
competition also has forced ntt to lower its long distance 
rates cutting into profits kajima said rate cuts cost ntt 110 
billion yen in long distance charges last year 
its local telephone services still run large deficits and it no 
longer can rely on its formerly overpriced longdistance services 
to make up the difference 
ntt stock closed at 151 million yen friday below the 16 
million yen price it was offered at when the company was first 
listed

when the us bond market rallies you can 
usually thank west germans japanese britons and other foreigners 
at the end of 1988 foreigners held an estimated 634 billion in 
us debt or about 56 percent of the 113 trillion in 
outstanding credit market debt last year alone foreigners pumped 
about 106 billion into the us credit market according to 
federal reserve statistics 
so when the bond market rallied recently on the newfound 
strength of the us dollar overseas foreign investment was a 
major reason a host of negative economic and political news in 
west germany japan and britain also played a role 
the reason when things arent going well abroad and us 
economic signs are being viewed in a positive light 
dollardenominated securities become a good investment for 
foreigners 
theyve turned on the buy signal said robert brusca chief 
economist for nikko securities international inc in new york 
there has been buying of both stocks and bonds he said 
foreigners have to buy dollars to do that and theyve been 
doing that 
when the dollar soared last week to a 29month high against the 
west german mark and a 19month high against the japanese yen 
foreign investors scrambled to buy us bonds 
the stock bribery scandal in japan that has led to prime 
minister noboru takeshitas resignation and domestic political 
pressures on west german chancellor helmut kohl also have weakened 
confidence in those countries 
and with central banks in west germany and japan pondering 
whether to raise interest rates in an attempt to stave off the 
rising dollar but still taking no action us bonds remained 
attractive 
the bank of england boosted its base lending rate a full point 
to 14 percent in the middle of last week fueling speculation that 
japan and west germany would follow suit and bond prices backed 
off a bit when interest rates rise bond prices fall 
the stronger dollar is a confidence builder for the foreign 
investor but if the dollar rises at too rapid a rate it raises 
doubts about durability said john lonski senior economist at 
moodys investors service 
a shaky economic climate in west germany and japan could spur a 
tightening of monetary policy 
in west germany the outlook on inflation has been bleak with 
high oil prices and a weak mark in japan import prices have 
increased rapidly and the yen has sunk but government officials 
there have said no change in monetary policy is yet warranted 
the initial impact of an interest rate hike by the bundesbank or 
bank of japan would reduce the need of the fed to ease monetary 
policy and bring down the value of the dollar which could reduce 
the foreign binge on us bonds 
the fed raised interest rates this spring to curb inflation and 
economic growth but with most us economic indicators pointing to 
a slowdown another increase has been viewed as unlikely for now 
foreign bondholders will find that because of policy changes 
in the united states directed at curbing domestic consumption and 
increasing exports the dollar will be worth more in terms of 
foreign securities lonski said 
because of huge us trade deficits foreign holdings of us 
debt have increased at average annual rate of 189 percent since 
the early1980s lonski said 
as long as the united states imports more than it exports 
foreigners can be expected to continue to loan billions to the 
country in the form of debt securities

the price of avon products inc stock bobbed up 
again friday after word of mary kay corps interest in the 
cosmetics company resurfaced 
speculators bought avon stock on the possibility that mary kay 
or another suitor might engage in a relentless pursuit of avon 
which last week rejected a 21 billion takeover bid from amway 
corp 
avon shares gained 187 a share rising to 37 by midafternoon 
as 142 million shares changed hands on the floor of the new york 
stock exchange 
buyers were motivated by release of a letter sent to avon 
chairman and chief executive officer james e preston in which john 
p rochon vice chairman of mary kay corp expressed interest in 
acquiring avon 
the letter made public thursday night contained no details of 
the financial aspects of a possible bid which had been mentioned 
in previous news accounts but never publicly confirmed by 
dallasbased mary kay 
rochon stated the letter was being released so its sales force 
would have information about the matter 
avon spokesman john cox said the company would have no comment 
on mary kays interest until after it was discussed at a regularly 
scheduled board meeting june 1 
wall street securities analysts were uncertain whether avon 
would feel more inclined toward accepting a bid from mary kay than 
it did toward amways advances in turning down amways 39ashare 
offer avon blasted its direct selling rival as a totally 
unsuitable match and criticized amway on moral and ethical grounds 
one of the principle complaints avon had was the difference in 
style between the two direct sellers which avon contended would 
result in a culture clash that could ruin business 
in a letter informing amway that its board had rejected amways 
proposal avon characterized its own 14 million sales 
representatives as friendly and caring with a gracious 
manner by contrast avon accused amway of fostering zealotry and 
highpressures selling tactics 
mary kay meanwhile was apparently anxious to dispel any 
misgivings avon might have about the compatability of the two 
companies 
the letter from rochon said that if the two companies united 
mary kay and avon each would maintain separate sales forces and 
identities 
i do believe as you do that each companys sales force has 
developed a culture of its own cultures which best remain 
distinct rochon stated 
he added however that the two cultures share the same 
underlying values and therefore the management approach which has 
proved valuable in motivating mary kays sales force to produce 
substantial growth will be transferable to avon 
rochon said an investor group he heads called argonaut partners 
which includes mary kay cosmetics inc the main holding of 
privatelyheld mary kay corp has been working with first boston 
corp as a financial adviser a spokeswoman for mary kay said she 
wasnt at liberty to disclose the partners 
one takeover stock specialist said the link with first boston a 
major merger and acquisition investment house might indicate the 
mary kayled investor group intends to wage a dogged attempt to get 
control of avon 
however this investor who spoke on condition that his name not 
be used said wall street was reluctant to push avon shares much 
higher because there is a perception avons management is 
determined to keep the company independent 
earlier this week avon shares got a lift from a published 
report that investor irwin l jacobs and an unidentified major 
company planned to launch a joint bid for avon at 40 a share 
usa today reported jacobs and the unidentified company were in 
the process of completing financing and other details of the 
hostile offer jacobs partner was said to be a company other than 
mary kay 
jacobs owns 103 percent of avons common stock through a 
partnership with amway amway an ada michbased direct selling 
firm withdrew its offer after avons rejection

japan and india reacted angrily and leveled 
countercharges against the united states on friday after being 
named along with brazil as serious fairtrade violators possibly 
subject to stiff retaliatory tariffs 
the brazilian government also denied allegations of unfair trade 
practices and a top presidential aide in brasilia said the nation 
would present solid arguments in its defense 
the bush administration on thursday listed countries with trade 
barriers most harmful to american producers as required by the 
1988 omnibus trade act the government has 18 months to negotiate 
away the barriers and failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of 
up to 100 percent on selected exports from the offenders 
foreign minister sousuke uno summoned us ambassador michael 
armacost to deliver a protest in tokyo and the government said 
there were errors in us complaints about alleged barriers to 
sales of supercomputers satellites and forest products in japan 
uno and other cabinet ministers said the us action was 
extremely regrettable and officials indicated japan would 
refuse to participate in talks sought by the united states to end 
the alleged practices 
this designation in no way possesses legal binding force in 
the international trade system said hiroshi mitsuzuka minister 
of international trade and industry 
india was cited for barriers against foreign investment and the 
closing of its insurance market to foreign companies the 
administration cited brazil for quotas on imports and licensing 
restrictions 
we regard this law and action under it as totally unjustified 
irrational and unfair indias commerce minister dinesh singh 
said in new delhi 
the united states action is particularly surprising because 
the us itself has built and retained a variety of barriers 
against access to its markets singh said it is hardly in a 
position to ask others to lift barriers without doing so itself 
in brasilia ronaldo costa couto the chief of staff of 
president jose sarney said in a radio interview that sarney was 
concerned about the us decision but said brazil has solid 
arguments in its defense 
all three nations have trade surpluses with the united states 
led by japans 52 billion surplus india had a 700 million 
surplus with the united states in 1988 while the most recent 
figures available from brazil indicate that nations us exports 
totaled 854 billion last year and us imports in the first 11 
months of 1988 totaled 274 billion 
last year us exports to japan rose 337 percent to 377 
billion and the bilateral trade deficit shrank by 44 billion 
according to us statistics but japanese exports surged this 
year increasing political pressure for washington to take action 
under the trade law 
mitsuzuka described us trade policy as to threaten other 
countries into negotiating by brandishing the threat of unilateral 
sanctions 
he said the policy was contrary to the principles of the 
multinational general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt and 
could undermine the existing multilateral free trade system and 
ongoing uruguay round of gatt 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said japan would agree 
to quiet talks that might coincide with us demands under the 
1988 trade law he also said japan might complain to gatt if the 
united states imposed sanctions 
japan has taken steps to open its markets uno said denying 
that the specific us complaints can be considered to constitute 
trade barriers 
i strongly regret the lack of fairness because the united 
states has unilaterally made such a decisiondespite the fact 
that the us itself maintains importrestrictive measures and 
practices to a considerable degree uno said 
takuma yamamoto president of supercomputer maker fujitsu ltd 
said the computer market in japan has been totally freed and 
the government policy on buying supercomputers contrary to the 
us complaint is not to discriminate between foreign and 
domestic producers 
he said us supercomputers have 15 percent of the japanese 
market while japanese supercomputers have only 2 percent of the 
us market no japanese supercomputer ever has been bought by a 
us public organization yamamoto said 
the government also said sales of us forestry products in 
japan had doubled from 1986 to 1988 and the minister of posts and 
telecommunications seiichi kataoka noted japan was buying five 
american satellites this year 
india last year exported about 32 billion worth of goods to 
the united states its biggest trading partner primarily 
clothing diamonds crude oil and cashews 
anwarul hoda joint secretary in the commerce ministry said 
indias trade surplus with the united states only started in 1983 
and had dropped sharply from 1 billion in 1987 to 700 million in 
1988

vacationers are expected to drive more this summer than last 
despite the recent jump in gasoline prices but will take shorter 
trips according to travel industry groups 
motor vehicles will account for nearly 83 percent of all summer 
travel with 273 million vacationers expected to travel the 
nations roads and highways in the 14week period between memorial 
day and labor day a 4 percent increase over 1988 
the sharp increases in gasoline prices since march 1989 
although higher than usual for the presummer travel season are 
not expected to be a serious deterrent to auto vacation travel this 
summer the washington dcbased us travel data center says 
the centers data are based on a national telephone survey of 1500 
households 
retail gasoline prices have risen an average of 174 cents a 
gallon since easter weekend the steepest rise between holidays 
since christmas 1979 and easter 1980 when prices jumped 19 cents a 
gallon according to the american automobile association 
the average retail cost of a gallon of gasoline is 1254 with 
actual costs varying between cities states and regions and 
selfserve or fullservice stations 
air travel is expected to remain relatively stable at last 
summers level representing about 15 percent of all vacation 
travel while bus and train travel which represents 1 percent is 
expected to be at capacity 
airline fares increased far more than motor fuel in the first 
quarter of 1989 62 percent versus 25 percent but 
secondquarter motor fuel prices have leaped more than 16 percent 
due to a combination of factors including the alaska oil spill and 
the strong rise in crude oil prices since january according to aaa 
overall summer vacation travel is expected to rise about 3 
percent from last year with vacationers generally opting for 
shorter trips industry surveys indicate 
more than half of all summer travelers will make round trips of 
500 miles or less according to aaa average domestic miles 
traveled are projected to decline to 920 from 970 last summer 
america wants to travel more than ever and its people are 
going to satisfy this desire even if the demands of time and 
twoincome families are forcing them to take three and fourday 
trips in place of one and twoweek vacations said suzanne cook 
director of the aaa data center 
according to the centers survey the volume of day trips and 
trips of up to three nights will rise 7 percent and comprise more 
than half of all summer vacation travel 
overall travel prices were up 45 percent during the first 
quarter of this year compared with last year according to the data 
center transportation and lodging costs were up 41 percent food 
and beverage costs up 46 percent and entertainment up 56 percent

students at the university of chicagos graduate 
school of business might be at a disadvantage when they land jobs 
because of the schools theorybased curriculum according to a 
report released friday 
the internal study recommends changing teaching methods to focus 
on practical applications 
you try to develop the disciplines underlying business 
management but then you have to follow through and show how they 
are applied kenneth french professor of finance and chairman of 
a 12member advisory committee said 
the panel surveyed the student body and conducted interviews 
with recruiters alumni and focus groups of students and faculty 
members the group received responses from more than 1350 of its 
full and parttime students 
students feel that their education would be improved if the 
faculty put more emphasis on the business applications of concepts 
theories and empirical evidence we teach the report said 
while the analytical approach emphasizes welldefined problems 
with welldefined answers students are confronted by ambiguous 
problems with no right answers in the workplace 
thus they may not be as well prepared to deal with some of 
the demands of their initial job as graduates from other business 
schools it said 
the study was prompted by a businessweek magazine survey 
published last fall that ranked chicagos business school no 11 in 
the nation northwestern universitys jl kellogg graduate school 
of management was ranked first 
we didnt do as well as we would have liked said john p 
gould dean of chicagos business school its not where we have 
been traditionally it is not the quality of this faculty which 
includes a number of nobel prizewnning economists and presidential 
advisors 
i think were closer to second or third or first gould said 
the report recommended more interaction outside of class between 
faculty and students it also suggested appointing coordinators to 
improve weaker courses 
in addition the report recommended cutting the number of 
fulltime mba candidates by 10 percent part of our problem is 
overcrowding french said and size also works against a sense 
of community 
currently the school has 1123 fulltime mba students up from 
521 in 1970 there also are more than 1000 parttime students 
pursuing mbas 
tuition for fulltime mba candidates will be 15500 next year 
or 1550 a course based on a 10course school year parttime 
students pay the same per course fee

the dollar continued sliding off the highs it 
reached earlier this week but finished mixed in a choppy domestic 
session friday after falling overseas 
the dollar was the center of a tugofwar between central banks 
from around the world which joined forces to push it lower and 
traders who viewed a lower dollar as a buying opportunity 
thin volume ahead of the long memorial day weekend heightened 
the dollars volatility most traders spent the day squaring their

but the central banks took notice of the gains for the first 
time in a long time weve seen coordinated central bank 
intervention by even the smaller countries barbanel said 
also us officials earlier this week spoke out against the 
dollars climb in an effort to stem further increases 
but when the central banks sold dollars at fridays lows in an 
attempt to depress the currency further traders viewed it as a 
buying opportunity said stephen flanagan a vice president at 
manufacturers hanover trust co 
while the intervention may have been effective over the course 
of the week flanagan said it failed friday the dollar just held 
at major support points he said 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14040 yen down from thursdays 
close of 14235 yen later in london the dollar was quoted at

general foods usa said friday it had fired 
ogilvy amp mather as the advertising agency for its maxwell house 
coffee brand which ogilvy has touted for 31 years as being good 
to the last drop 
the food company said that following a review of several months 
it was awarding the account valued at more than 50 million to 
darcy masius benton amp bowles another new yorkbased ad agency 
the switch comes after maxwell house lost its longstanding 
position as the biggest selling domestic coffee brand to procter amp 
gambles folgers 
this was a tough call that in the final analysis was based 
strongly on strategy and creative recommendations ray viault 
president of maxwell house said in a statement from company 
headquarters at white plains ny 
the account loss comes as a blow to ogilvy amp mather the largest 
us unit of the ogilvy group ogilvy group management recently 
accepted an 864 million buyout offer from britains wpp group plc 
another advertising giant 
however both general foods and ogilvy amp mather said the pending 
takeover had nothing to do with the maxwell house account switch 
they said the agency review started months before the wpp deal was 
negotiated 
its a tough blow said ogilvy chairman kenneth roman we 
thought we did a very good job but they thought the other agency 
did a better job 
roman declined to speculate whether the account loss would lead 
to layoffs at the agency which has handled maxwell house since 
1958 
ogilvy amp mather has other major assignments from general foods 
including post cereals and tang and country time beverages and 
several assignments for coffee and other products overseas 
the account win is the second major victory for darcy in two 
weeks miamibased burger king corp tapped darcy and saatchi amp 
saatchi advertising to split its 200 millionplus account on may 
18 
clayton wilhite president of the us division of darcy 
congratulated the agencys employees in a memo for what was 
arguably the two biggest backtoback new assignments in industry 
history 
darcy has worked with general foods since 1929 and creates 
adverrtsiing for its cool whip topping and good seasons salad 
dressing 
the maxwell house brand has been losing ground in the shrinking 
us coffee market in recent years 
john mcmillin food industry analyst for prudentialbache 
securities said maxwell house lost its longstanding ranking as 
the biggest selling brand in the us coffee market to folgers 
he said maxwell houses share of the 39 billion market fell to 
25 percent in 1988 from just over 27 percent of a 41 billion 
market in 1987 while folgers share rose to 279 percent from 27 
percent 
mcmillin said the new managers at general foods which has 
become part of the kraft general foods group at philip morris cos 
inc are intent on reestablishing maxwell house as the 
bestselling coffee brand 
a new ad agency may give the brand a little bit of life he 
said 
while ogilvy has used the good to the last drop slogan in 
its maxwell house advertising general foods credits theodore 
roosevelt for coining the phrase decades earlier 
the company said roosevelt used the phrase to describe coffee at 
the maxwell house hotel in nashville where it is believed the brand 
was born 
among ogilvys more recent ads for maxwell house have been 
commercials featuring commentator linda ellerbee and weatherman 
willard scott touting results of recent taste tests that compared 
maxwell house and folgers 
ogilvy got some encouraging news friday despite the maxwell 
house account loss cotton inc a new yorkbased concern 
representing cotton growers that had considered moving its account 
in the wake of the wpp deal said it had decided to keep its 10 
million assignment at ogilvy

atampt and its unions reported progress friday 
in a hectic day of negotiations but remaining disputes over wages 
and particularly health benefits left in doubt whether a new 
contract could be settled before a saturday night deadline 
things have started to heat up said francine zucker a 
spokeswoman for the communications workers of america i think 
were going to get very close and we may reach a settlement but 
that can change quickly 
ms zucker and american telephone amp telegraph officials said 
both sides were exchanging offers and counteroffers in the 
fastestpaced day of negotiating since the talks opened in late 
march 
it is true that we are making progress in some areas but 
clearly there are still some issues significant issues to be 
resolved said atampt spokesman herb linnen we remain optimistic 
that those hurdles can be overcome 
union atampt workers nationwide staged a fiveminute work stoppage 
at 415 pm edt friday in a show of union solidarity 
in the talks atampt officials said the company offered to limit 
its use of temporary workers a key union jobsecurity demand 
still it would take a major breakthrough to resolve the pay and 
health benefits disputes and both sides were preparing for a 
possible strike when the current contracts for about 160000 
workers expire at 1159 pm edt saturday 
sources close to the talks said atampt which earlier this week 
proposed having employees pay more at first for health care 
proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sides 
to revise the offer neither side would discuss details but a 
union official said it was a reconfiguration of the existing 
offer and it is unacceptable both sides have characterized 
health benefits as the issue most likely to prevent settlement 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity agreed with the 
public statements of progress but cautioned that the negotiations 
were at a volatile stage and could turn for the worse in an 
arrangement likely to be repeated saturday formal negotiating 
committees met at a washington hotel while the two union presidents 
and atampts top negotiator held periodic meetings on the major 
issues 
whether the unions the cwa and the international brotherhood 
of electrical workers would immediately call a strike remained 
unclear 
if a contract agreement appears at hand at the deadline the 
unions likely would agree to negotiate for another day or two even 
if major barriers remain union officials have said they might not 
immediately strike and instead might try other strategies 
including a nationwide labor boycott of atampts longdistance 
service 
we wont make that call until saturday ms zucker said 
both sides have throughout the talks expressed hope a settlement 
would be reached before the current contracts expire but friday 
marked the first time both sides reported significant progress 
in addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers 
atampt has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eye 
and dental care and its parental leave policy also it has 
proposed for the first time allowing leave for workers to care for 
sick relatives 
those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the company 
made monday a package which provided varying base wage increases 
and lump sum payments depending on job classification and also a 
new profitsharing plan for union workers also included was a 
proposal to make employees pay more up front for health care 
although current caps on how much a worker might have to spend in a 
year would remain in effect atampt also proposed a lifetime benefits 
cap of 1 million 
the unions are seeking expanded medical benefits at no

the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago 
board of trade have agreed to try to unify their planned 
afterhours electronic trading systems the two announced jointly 
on friday 
the announcement comes as a marked turnaround for the board of 
trade which has been highly critical of the mercs planned globex 
system and last fall recommended that the federal government deny 
the merc permission to operate it 
the cbot at the time said the mercs system would be difficult 
to operate and susceptible to abuse the cbot has been making plans 
for an afterhours electronic trading system of its own called 
aurora 
however multiple trading systems place economic and 
technological demands upon market users which increase the cost of 
doing business the two trading organizations said friday in 
their statement 
the cbot and the merc are committed to offering their 
members and trading public the best markets at the lowest cost 
while preserving their unrivaled liquidity the statement said 
successful discussions on unifying systems along with approval 
by respective memberships of the exchanges would result in a 
single trading and order delivery system the statement said 
a board of trade spokesman said the exchange had no further 
comment on the announcement 
a call to leo melamed chairman of the executive committee of 
the mercantile exchange was not immediately returned friday 
londonbased reuters holdings plc which disseminates financial 
news and market information and is providing the technical 
expertise for globex is absolutely delighted with the 
announcment it said in a separate statement 
we look forward to working closely with both exchanges as 
their discussions progress said andre villeneuve president of 
reuters america inc the us holding company for reuters 
the mercs original plans called for globex to be operating by 
summer its aim is to link investors in north america europe and 
asia through an electronic system for trading futures and options 
contracts on currency futures including the british pound the 
west german mark the swiss franc the japanese yen and eurodollar 
time deposits 
the system would operate during hours when the chicago 
mercantile exchanges trading floor in chicago is closed 
similarly the board of trades aurora system originally 
planned to begin operating in the fall would be activated after 
the close of daytime trading hours on the chicago exchange floor 
the aurora system will handle only trading on financial futures 
and futures options said the cbot spokesman who asked not to be 
identified 
futures and options allow investors to speculate on the future 
performance of commodities and financial instruments

president bush may say he justifiably punished 
japan by formally branding it an unfair trading partner but 
critics say he actually may have lobbed an economic boomerang 
against the financially powerful japanese 
the result they say could smack the united states from behind 
with a drastic drop in japanese investment in this country which 
at its worst could force a sharp runup in interest rates and cost 
many jobs two key ingredients for a recession 
even michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser 
counseled against targeting japan boskin has said publicly that 
american efforts to punish trading partners could incite acute 
worldwide economic problems 
bush named japan along with india and brazil for what he 
described as persistently unfair practices that deny foreign access 
to their markets in businesses that range from supercomputers to to 
satellites to insurance 
he took the action this past week under a provision of the 1988 
trade law that requires the white house to compile what amounts to 
a target list of countries with barriers to american exporters 
the law requires the united states to impose up to 100 percent 
tariffs on goods from those countries if negotiations to erase the 
barriers fail 
bush said his goal was to force the three countries to to work 
constructively with us to resolve these issues expeditiously but 
the immediate reaction was to provoke outrage from the target 
countries 
the most significant response came from japan which threatened 
to take the united states to international trade court and hinted 
at other possible retaliation for what the japanese called an 
extremely regrettable decision 
exactly how tokyo would respond remained unclear by the end of 
the week but by many measures the japanese have amassed enormous 
influence in the american economy so any countermeasures could 
have potential severity opponents of trade sanctions argue 
japanese products accounted for 44 percent of the 1198 billion 
us trade deficit last year japanese purchases of us real 
estate have helped buoy property values in such cities as new york 
and los angeles many japanese companies now assemble products in 
the united states japan buys billions of dollars worth of us 
government bonds crucial to financing the federal budget deficit 
abrupt tariffrelated price hikes for imported japanese 
computers cars televisions or videocassette recorders would 
create some pain in the united states but if japanese investors 
shed large holdings of us securities the consequences could be 
much more profound 
in a worstcase scenario for example japanese sales of us 
stocks could douse wall streets markets widely touted revival 
without japanese purchases of treasury bonds the government would 
be forced to raise interest rates to attract investors driving up 
rates in the credit markets and making it harder for american 
consumers and businesses to borrow money 
the ripple effect could range from mortgage defaults and 
business bankruptcies to a drop in consumer spending forcing 
companies to cut production and lay off employees a surge in idled 
workers could cause another round of loan defaults and decline in 
consumer spending and the cycle would start again 
in other business and economic news this past week 
more evidence emerged that the economy is slowing but may not 
skid into a recession the government revised its firstquarter 
economic growth estimate to 43 percent from 55 percent while 
durable goods orders rose 29 percent in april and personal income 
rose 11 percent suggesting underlying strength 
the us dollar took investors on an adventurous ride surging 
early in the week to some of the highest levels in two years for 
reasons that ranged sheer speculation to political turmoil abroad 
but by the end of the week new skepticism about the dollar emerged 
on speculation that key us trading partners would raise interest 
rates to make their currencies more valuable 
donald trump triumphed in a bidding war for the eastern 
airlines lucrative northeast shuttle with a 365 million offer but 
the fate of the rest of the airline remained uncertain after nearly 
three months of a crippling strike and bankruptcycourt maneuvering

steelworkers said friday theyd tentatively agreed on a 50month 
contract that restores pay cuts and matches wage gains won by the 
union at bethlehem steel corp 
the national settlement is the second among four major producers 
that faced expiring contracts july 31 it was approved by local 
presidents on the union negotiating committee late thursday the 
same day union members ratified the bethlehem contract 
national had been expected to tailor its agreement to the 
bethlehem settlement even though nationals profits per ton of 
steel are the lowest among the major us producers 
this agreement looks both forward and backward buddy davis 
the unions chief negotiator and negotiating secretary harry 
lester said in a statement it recognizes that our members have 
not had a wage increase since 1982 and that they have made 
significant sacrifices to help the company return to 
profitability 
the contract effective june 1 covers 7300 union members at 
the three plants operated by the nations sixthlargest steelmaker 
st louis portage ind and ecorse mich 
it restores wage sacrifices made in 1986 raising average base 
wages by 181 per hour to 1369 by the time it expires in july

past concessions and a 500 cash advance on profitsharing for 
1989 pension and medical benefits also will be improved and new

markets this looks about in line with inflation the only 
problem is the steel prices arent going up along with inflation
