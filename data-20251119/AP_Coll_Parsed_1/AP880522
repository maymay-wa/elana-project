for people to make even emergency calls 
with 911 numbers not operating in the states largest city 
police here were assigned to fire departments and major

mountains to just west of rockingham 120 miles away in the 
southcentral part of teh state southern bell telephone co

a power failure at a main switching center unprecedented for 
the district caused a total disruption of longdistance calls and 
kept local calls to a trickle phone company officials said

talks between the united states and 
the philippines on the future of american military bases are near 
collapse because of wide differences between the two sides manila 
newspapers report 
us officials declined comment on the reports which appeared 
saturday and sunday in most major dailies the governments last 
month began reviewing the current agreement under which the united 
states maintains six installations here including subic bay naval 
base and clark air base 
manila newspapers quoted an unnamed ranking filipino 
diplomat as saying the sides were worlds apart on virtually 
every issue including compensation criminal jurisdiction and 
security 
the newspapers quoted the source as saying the philippine 
government would rather break off the talks than be criticized 
later for succumbing to the americans 
he accused the us panel led by ambassador nicholas platt of 
stonewalling on virtually every issue the papers reported 
american diplomats here have privately complained that the 
philippine panel violated an understanding by leaking details on 
the negotiations which began april 5 
the current talks cover only the status of the bases through 
1991 when the current agreement expires however the outcome is 
expected to determine whether manila allows the bases to remain 
after 1991 
under the current constitution any extension must be provided 
for in a formal treaty approved by twothirds of the 23member 
senate where antibases sentiment is strong 
president corazon aquino has agreed to honor the current 
agreement but refuses to say whether she would support an 
extension her term expires in 1992 and she has ruled out seeking 
reelection

nearly 2000 hindus buddhists and 
christians marched toward parliament on sunday to protest proposed 
legislation to establish islam as the state religion of bangladesh 
witnesses said 
the bill introduced in parliament on may 11 sparked criticism 
from major opposition parties womens rights organizations and 
secular groups 
riot police blocked the protestors about a mile from the 
parliament building according to witnesses the police permitted a 
small delegation of demonstrators to drive up to the parliament 
building and deliver a written protest 
sundays march was organized by a council comprised of 
bangladeshs three largest minorities hindus christians and 
buddhists who account for 13 percent of the total population the 
group was formed after the introduction of the bill 
in the protest memorandum the council said that declaration 
of islam as the only state religion will result in destroying 
national unity curtailing equal rights of other communities and 
even encouraging them to take a separatist stand 
critics have said the move could cause friction between 
religions and curtail womens rights since under islamic lawsm 
women are discouraged from appearing in public 
it is also feared that this islamization move may be followed 
by a separate electorate of the minority communities the 
memorandum added 
an official of the governing jatiya party who spoke on 
condition of anonymity told the associated press that the 
parliament will begin debating the bill shortly the party 
controls 215 seats in the 300member parliament following elections 
in march that were boycotted by opposition groups 
we shall not allow the illegal parliament to pass any bill or 
amend the constitution president hussain muhammad ershad is 
playing with fire warned sheikh hasina president of the awami 
league a major opposition group she spoke at a meeting sunday 
ershad who sponsored the legislation has assured minority 
groups that their rights will not be curtailed by the establishment 
of islam as the state religion 
vice president nurul islam told a meeting of moslem religious 
leaders in dhaka on saturday that the move to make islam a state 
religion is a pragmatic step since more than 87 percent of 
bangladesh population is moslem 
islam is a complete code of life and hence it cannot be seen 
isolated from politics islam said 
under the countrys first constitution framed in 1972 
secularism was established as one of the four basic principles of 
the state created in 1971 after a war of independence against 
pakistan which is 97 percent moslem 
the move for making islam a state religion goes against the 
principles and values of our liberation war in 1971 said hasina 
the push to institutionalize islam got under way in 1977 when 
thenpresident ziaur rahman altered the constitution with a clause 
declaring complete faith in the moslem religion

a quarter of a century after its 
founding the organization of african unity is anything but united 
the group celebrates is silver anniversary beset by religious 
political and ethnic differences and haunted by its inability to 
topple south africa and that nations system of racial segregation 
when the oau the worlds largest continental organization was 
formed on may 25 1963 twothirds of the current members still 
were under colonial rule 
the group chose ethiopia as its headquarters the only african 
country never under the yoke of colonialists 
in the cramped africa hall the organization conducts annual 
summits under the paintings of its 32 founders only two of whom 
remain in power felix houphouetboigny of the ivory coast and king 
hassan ii of morocco 
of the other 30 founders 24 were overthrown in coups or 
revolutions three died peacefully in office and three stepped 
aside to make way for a younger generation of leaders 
its 50 members are seemingly at an impasse over how to gain 
liberation for the blacks of south africa and for neighboring 
namibia under south africas control 
on sunday delegates at an oau foreign ministers meeting 
debated south africa activists berated the group for not giving 
enough money to antiapartheid groups while organization members 
criticized the groups for lack of unity 
indeed the organizations 22yearold liberation committee 
which once helped finance freedom fights now dispenses more 
rhetoric than action members owe the committee 12 million 
a statement or resolution reaffirming commitment to the 
national liberation movements are certainly welcome but more 
welcome would be checks wiping off respective arrears to the oau 
liberation committee said gora ebrahim of the antiapartheid 
panafricanist congress of south africa 
zimbabwe foreign minister nathan shamuyarira the new chairman 
of the liberation committee countered that the panafricanist 
congress should close ranks with its guerrilla rival the african 
national congress and fight south africas whiteled government 
together 
meanwhile black africa does 1 billion in business with south 
africa each year much of it covertly 
though the organizations successes are few some say its very 
survival must be considered a victory 
our detractors have been predicting the demise of the oau 
since its inception said one southern african delegate who spoke 
on condition of anonymity that it can commemorate its 25th 
anniversary is an achievement in itself 
the most serious threat to the organizations survival was in 
198384 when most of the members balked at attending scheduled 
summits in tripoli the libyan capital 
conservative african states with pressure from western 
governments stayed away from the meetings because it would have 
meant that libyan leader col moammar gadhafi would have become the 
oaus next chairman 
the oau customarily appointed the leader of a host country as 
chairman for one year the organization later appointed president 
daniel arap moi of kenya to the ceremonial position 
the oau later abandoned its policy of rotating annual summits 
among various african capitals and made ethiopia its permanent 
venue 
in 1984 charter member morocco became the only county to quit 
the oau after the oau admitted as a member the polisario front a 
guerrilla movement that has been fighting morocco since 1975 over 
the mineralrich western sahara 
beneath the oaus veneer of unity are rivalries between arab and 
black african members moslem and christian members and capitalist 
and socialist states 
the oau has pushed for regional trade agreements but most 
african countries biggest trading partners remain their former 
colonizers 
fewer than half the heads of state ever attend oau summits 
but when there is a commonwealth or francoafrican summit all 
african heads of state attend oau secretarygeneral idi oumarou 
of niger said in an interview 
the oau is bound by its charter not to interfere in the internal 
affairs of members a dictate that silences the organization on 
many issues 
africa kept quiet while idi amin the former uganda dictator and 
oau chairman in 1975 massacred 500000 of his people during a 
nineyear rule 
the silence was broken only when former president julius nyerere 
of tanzania sent his troops into uganda in 1979 to help rebels 
overthrow amin 
the question of human rights is only raised in reference to 
south africas system of apartheid which allows the 26 million 
blacks no vote in national affairs and gives the 5 million whites 
control of the economy and separate districts schools and health 
services

in a week of divided loyalties at the justice 
department civil rights chief william bradford reynolds tried to 
defend attorney general edwin meese iii while remaining true to a 
friend that meese had just fired department spokesman terry 
eastland 
reynolds efforts at damage control reflected his burgeoning 
influence at the department as the attorney generals troubles have 
mounted 
a remark by the attorney general appeared in print wednesday 
contradicting eastlands explanation that meese had dismissed him 
for not defending the attorney general aggressively enough 
baloney meese had said when asked whether he had fired 
eastland for inadequately defending him 
reynolds who is meeses counselor and long a member of his 
inner circle quickly consulted the attorney general and then 
reiterated an order he had put out previously no one was to say 
anything negative about eastland according to department sources 
who discussed the events on condition they not be identified 
meeses political aides were told by reynolds to keep the long 
knives sheathed said one department source the motivation said 
the source was to avoid an unseemly public feud with eastland 
meese didnt repeat the baloney quote and doggedly stuck 
with the explanation that he was replacing his chief spokesman 
simply because it was time for a change in leadership meanwhile 
eastland maintained his silence on details surrounding his firing 
and continued to say that he feels the attorney general is honest 
and wellintentioned 
reynolds role in eastlands firing remains unclear 
department sources said that while reynolds knew meese and 
eastland were to have a lateafternoon meeting on may 14 about how 
to handle department issues and criticism they insist that 
reynolds had no idea meese was contemplating relieving eastland of 
his duties 
but several other department sources say reynolds and the 
attorney general work together so closely that reynolds almost 
certainly had to have helped bring about eastlands dismissal they 
say reynolds had long taken a more aggressive approach than 
eastland in responding to criticism of meese and the department 
the eastland dismissal which was publicly disclosed last 
monday has put reynolds and other meese loyalists who also are 
friends of eastland in a difficult position 
over a period of several years eastland and reynolds frequently 
jogged together reynolds was instrumental in getting meese to hire 
eastland as director of the departments public affairs office in 
1985 
when reynolds was preparing to attack various supreme court 
decisions the speechwriting duties for the project were carried 
out by the staunchly conservative eastland and gary mcdowell who 
last week said the eastland firing was the worst mistake meese 
has made as attorney general 
eastlands wife had worked for reynolds in the justice 
departments civil rights division which reynolds heads eastland 
and his wife were among the small group of friends at reynolds 
wedding last year 
reynolds was out front in the chorus of praise for eastland last 
week at the same time he led the charge when it came to defending 
meese 
after the conservative washington times in the wake of the 
eastland firing called on meese to resign reynolds wrote a 
rebuttal saying the newspaper had joined the chants of those who 
despise everything the reagan administration stands for in the 
fields of criminal justice and constitutional law

george bush is waging a private battle on the 
campaign trail with things that grind whir hum and clank its a 
lovehate relationship with heavy machinery 
the vice president appears to be perpetually climbing into 
cockpits of airplanes easing himself behind the wheels of trucks 
and farm equipment climbing into boats pulling levers on assembly 
lines and donning helmets hard hats and laboratory smocks 
hardly a campaign day goes by without at least one carefully 
orchestrated event in which bush gets a chance to pose for cameras 
inside around or on top of some form of heavy equipment 
plant visits are standard campaign fare and democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis has been doing his own share of 
factory tours but bush without any republican opposition to worry 
about seems to have more time to squeeze such events into his 
schedule and he approaches machinery with a certain gusto all his 
own 
but not all of bushs encounters with technology are successful 
at a procter and gamble plant near cincinnati bush pressed a 
switch to start a machine that sent toothpaste flowing through a 
labyrinth of pipes he was invited to hold a waiting empty 
tootpaste tube its bottom open under a spigot 
a quizzical expression flashed across his face as only a few 
drops trickled into his tube while a torrent of the green gooey 
stuff gushed out of a nearby pipe into a waste barrel 
at the general dynamics aircraft production plant in fort worth 
texas bush climbed inside a flight simulater to fly an f16 
fighter jet but the former world war ii torpedo bomber pilot 
admitted sheepishly afterward that he had brought the plane down 
too hard on the runway unintentionally simulating a nearcrash 
landing 
bush dresses up or down as each occasion warrants so flight 
jackets and pilot helmets appear for those frequent climbs into 
aircraft cockpits at a semiconductor plant in oregon bush was 
garbed in a full fab bunny suit special headtotoe overalls 
designed to keep dust at a minimum 
but even for bush there are limits after all there are still 
those wimp accusations that come up from time to time 
so on a tour of the hershey chocolate factory in pennsylvania 
reporters secret service agents and bush aides were ordered to don 
hairnets a gesture to cleanliness while the vice president was 
allowed to cover his head with a hard hat 
unlike walter mitty the james thurber character who could only 
daydream of a secret life bush gets to act out other peoples jobs 
at least for the duration of a five or 10minute photo 
opportunity 
at the cleveland clinic bush donned a white medical coat and 
held a mechanical heart in his hands as he conferred with a group 
of physicians and researchers bush said he thought the heart 
seemed awfully heavy suggesting the patient would have to be 
fairly robust 
that is a potential problem he was told it was one site where 
bush wasnt invited to participate further 
he toured an ibm center in thornwood ny and was given an 
exhibit of a computeraided robotics manufacturing system and 
watched as a robot arm assembled a delicate piece of equipment did 
he want to take a stab at making the robot reassemble the device 
i dont know what the hell it is bush confessed 
at fort wayne bush toured a plant that makes military radios 
he was invited to get behind the wheel of a jeep to inspect one he 
promptly climbed into the passenger seat instead possibly 
exhibiting a longingrained vice presidential tendency 
a few days later bush helped drive a few rivets into a 
hummer the allpurpose military vehicle that is replacing the 
jeep and was invited to take one out for a spin 
im going to get in the right side of the car this time he 
joked 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said the candidates 
frequent visits to plants are intended to show clearly that he is 
concerned about the economy as it relates to people to 
individuals you can talk about jobs but its important to 
relate to people on a personal level 
the campaign also wants to suggest that bush is looking to the 
future and thats why hightech plants are favored fuller said 
these are jobs that are going to lead up to the 21st century 
he said 
but sometimes even nature seems to conspire against bush 
there he was in an open barn on a family farm in southeastern 
idaho ready to go out and inspect some irrigation equipment in 
this dry region of the country where it almost never rains 
it poured

twelveyearold adrienne carter already has 
160 socked away for college and shes earning more each day 
through an innovative program that rewards public school students 
with dollars for good grades 
adrienne plans to use the money she stockpiles through the 
scholarshipinescrow program to study architecture or interior 
design after she graduates from high school in five years 
i really really want to become something in this world 
said adrienne a seventhgrader at the cleveland school of science 
in order to do that you need a good education 
adrienne earned the 160 with three as one b and a c a grade 
that shes determined to improve when i see as it makes me 
happy that i did that good she said 
the scholarship program is the brainchild of alfred d tutela 
superintendent of the city school system and is a joint project of 
the system and the greater cleveland roundtable a group of civic 
and business leaders 
the project is designed to keep students in school motivate 
them to improve their grades and encourage them to continue their 
education after graduation 
the roundtable has solicited commitments for 12 million of the 
16 million needed to fund the program for five years mostly from 
cleveland foundations and corporations such as trw inc eaton 
corp and bp america inc 
a growing number of school systems around the country are 
adopting similar paytolearn plans but the cleveland program is 
believed to be the only one that encompasses all students in a 
district 
at the school of science 14yearold bouk sim said some of his 
eighthgrade classmates are competing among themselves to improve 
their grades 
i think its going to make a lot of difference before they 
didnt have a reason to do their work but now theyre being paid 
to get as bs and cs he said 
tutela said he suggested the scholarship program to fight the 
districts horrendous dropout problem 
fifty percent of the students who enter clevelands public 
schools dont graduate with their classmates although 15 percent 
do reenroll at some point he said of those who graduate only 25 
percent go on to college according to the superintendent 
the scholarship program is actually half of a twopronged 
project the schooltowork transition program an expansion of an 
existing program provides jobreadiness training and grants 
graduates priority for entrylevel jobs 
through both programs tutela said he wants to break the 
pattern of failure among the districts 73000 students and 
motivate them to achieve 
failure is learned and accepted its one thing to fail and 
say im going to improve its another thing to fail and say thats 
all i can do he said in an interview last week motivate kids 
to achieve and achievement will then motivate itself 
tutela said motivation has to start at an early age before 
they get into puberty before theyve got their mindsets during 
visits to schools last september he said even the youngest 
children knew about the scholarship program which had been 
announced last summer 
to illustrate the point tutela popped unannounced into a 
thirdgrade class and asked what do you have to do to go to 
college 
work hard responded a handful of the startled youngsters 
beginning with the grading period that ended april 15 students 
in grades 7 through 12 earn 40 for an a 20 for a b and 10 for a 
c in english mathematics foreign language social studies and 
science students in honors courses receive a 10 bonus per course 
in six years a straight a student can accrue as much as 4800 
or 6000 if enrolled in honors courses the money will be held in 
a trust fund and can be used for up to eight years after graduation 
for college technical or vocational training programs 
the money will be paid directly to the institution if the 
student doesnt graduate from the school district or fails to use 
the money within eight years the money remains in the fund 
many clevelandarea universities and colleges have agreed to 
match or supplement the scholarship program for students who attend 
their schools 
tutela said hell consider the program a success if the number 
of collegebound students doubles 
when are we going to see the return is it going to work 
well see that beyond us he said but when teachers and kids 
are talking about college and achievement and they start connecting 
their relationship something has got to be going on

the confrontational tone of president reagans 
presummit rhetoric apparently came as a surprise to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev even though the president has been using 
similar anticommunist rhetoric for nearly four decades 
reagan takes to moscow the view that the relationship between 
the united states and the soviet union no matter how gentlemanly 
it becomes is a conflict between good and evil 
he is probably facing realities what appear to him realities 
now but his likes and dislikes are probably the same as they were 
all along says vladimir petrov professor emeritus of 
international affairs at george washington university 
gorbachev reacted with dismay after the president made a world 
affairs council speech in springfield mass on april 21 boasting 
that his has been the administration that said communism was 
bad 
hes been saying that however ever since his days as a movie 
actor 
in 1951 testifying at a house committee on unamerican 
activities hearing on alleged communist influence in hollywood 
reagan said i abhor their philosophy but i detest their tactics 
which are those of a fifth column and are dishonest 
that was when he was still a democrat after he became a 
republican he was more outspoken 
in 1981 in his first news conference as president reagan said 
the only morality they recognize is what will further their 
cause meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any 
crime to lie to cheat in order to attain that 
the next year in a speech to members of the british parliament 
in london the president spoke of a march of freedom and 
democracy which will leave marxismleninism on the ash heap of 
history 
in a speech in orlando fla in march 1983 during the 
national debate on the nuclear weapons freeze movement he 
cautioned members of the evangelical clergy against being tempted 
to label both sides equally at fault to ignore the facts of 
history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire to simply 
call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove 
yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and 
evil 
in springfield reagan returned to the same theme saying of his 
administration we acknowledged the depth of our disagreements 
and their fundamental moral import in this way we acknowledged 
that the differences that separated us and the soviets were deeper 
and wider than just missile counts and numbers of warheads 
he also said that by making a moral and spiritual point of 
eastwest differences his administration had steered ussoviet 
relations toward a period of realistic engagement 
in that spirit he accused the soviets of backing regimes that 
were an outrage to the conscience of mankind and said that if 
the soviet union was changing it was because the costs of 
aggression and the real moral difference between our systems were 
brought home to it 
gorbachev decrying this confrontational approach said 
we have so far been showing restraint but if we reciprocate 
and we can do so over a very wide range of issues the atmosphere 
of sovietamerican relations can become such that it will make it 
no longer possible to solve any further issues 
the soviet leader appeared to lament a departure from the 
atmosphere of cordiality that prevailed at his summit meeting with 
reagan in washington in december 
during a break in that meeting the president told a group of 
columnists that gorbachev unlike past soviet leaders had not 
openly expressed acceptance of the marxian theory of the 
oneworld communist state and that he seemed to believe in 
competitive societies living in peace in the world together 
reagan also said however i havent softened up this 
doesnt mean that im dropping my guard or anything 
its a very odd situation said michael r beschloss an 
adjunct historian at the smithsonian institution and author of a 
recent book that describes the abortive eisenhowerkhruschev summit 
of 1960 the last time a republican president winding up two full 
terms in office went to see a soviet leader 
on the one hand he reagan has been very bitter in his 
estimate of what motivates the soviet union and if he were still 
to believe that it would conflict with what he has been doing over 
the past year he has tried to paper that over by saying that 
gorbachev is a new type of soviet leader that has got him in great 
trouble with conservatives 
in the view of some experts gorbachev may be in a similar 
situation at home 
quite possibly there are also people around him in moscow who 
dont like the many concessions he has made to the united states 
and he has to stand up in order to demonstrate to his associates 
that he is no pushover said petrov 
maybe gorbachev doesnt think he has been adequately rewarded 
by the united states for his being so forthcoming that we keep on 
growling even if he delivered more than his predecessors ever could 
or would 
there probably will be more smiles than growls in the public 
meetings in moscow but not because ronald reagan has changed his 
views 
i wasnt up on the communists he once said in looking back 
on his days with the screen actors guild he has had some 40 years 
to bone up on them and his lesson is still as he put in a 1985 
speech to the united nations 
we americans do not accept that any government has the right 
to command and order the lives of its people that any nation has 
an historic right to use force to export its ideology this belief 
regarding the nature of man and the limitations of government is at 
the core of our deep and abiding differences with the soviet union 
differences that put us into natural conflict and competition 
with one another

rush walker taylor jr doesnt remember making 
a speech in ninth grade about wanting to be an ambassador but at 
least one of his classmates in crockett texas four decades later 
remembers 
and when word from washington reached crockett that taylor was 
on his way to west africa as envoy to togo a ribbon of savanna 
hills and coastal plains the classmate reminded the career 
diplomat in a letter of those dreams so long ago born in the piney 
woods of east texas 
taylors father a clothing company salesman whose territory 
covered a big chunk of east texas moved his family from arkansas 
to crockett which now has about 7500 inhabitants when rush jr 
was 8 
they settled into a house built in 1830 where davy crockett 
spent the night on his way to the alamo and it was there in one of 
the earliest cities in texas that taylor decided to become an 
ambassador 
a teacher who had traveled in europe kindled his interest in 
history and the world and by the time he was in high school 
taylor was determined to work for the foreign service he began his 
career with the state department in 1962 after graduating from 
harvard and the university of virginia law school and serving in 
the us army for two years 
president reagan in april nominated taylor to be ambassador to 
togo a sliver of country smaller than west virginia that the state 
department says is one of the worlds least developed it has a per 
capita income of 250 
taylor is to be sworn in on thursday and when he leaves for the 
capital lome in june sen phil gramm rtexas says taylor will 
be taking a knowledge of the united states molded by life in 
smalltown america 
i think its helpful when youve got people around the world 
representing america who are from smaller towns and who understand 
the fundamental values of america if youre going to represent 
american interests you have to know what they are said gramm 
you cant grow up in crockett and not understand america 
he combines the best in rural roots good education small 
town boy makes good in an area that has until pretty recently been 
dominated by people who were primarily very high income people 
said gramm who introduced taylor to the senate foreign relations 
committee when it considered the nomination 
since word first got out taylor said hes received more than a 
dozen phone calls and letters of congratulations from people in 
crockett who he had not see since school 
one guy reminded me of when we were in ninth grade when i 
made some kind of speech about wanting to be an ambassador i had 
forgotten but he had not he said 
taylor 53 who will be serving in his first ambassadorial post 
has had other african assignments in yaounde cameroon in the 
early 1960s and in guineabissau he also has worked in 
washington rome florence portugal and the bahamas 
he said the united states couldnt ask for better relations 
with the government of togo although us efforts are dwarfed by 
the contributions of france 
togo has an open commercially oriented economy with a liberal 
investment code the state department said it is a predominately 
agricultural country and exports phosphates cotton coffee and 
cocoa

rival moslem militias blasted the 
tenements and shacks of south beirut on sunday with mortars and 
rocketpropelled grenades proiranian extremists pledged to 
protect western hostages held in the slums a newspaper reported 
the nations leading shiite moslem cleric said he would work to 
end the hostage situation 
police said six people were killed and 14 wounded in the 17th 
day of fighting between the proiranian hezbollah and the 
syrianbacked amal militias 
the casualties brought the overall toll to 266 killed and 873 
injured since fighting broke out may 6 for control of the slums 
where extremists linked to hezbollah are believed holding 18 
western hostages including nine americans 
syrian troops appeared poised to enter the area 
there is no way to stop the fighting other than a syrian 
military deployment brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military 
intelligence chief in lebanon said in a statement broadcast by 
beirut radio stations 
he did not set a deadline for deployment in the warren of narrow 
alleys and cementblock shanties that serves as a base for 
proiranian kidnappers aircraft hijackers and assassins 
but kenaan said by the time we deploy i hope there will be 
no hostages left in captivity he did not elaborate 
on saturday us envoy vernon walters said syria was aware it 
could endanger the hostages by moving into the slums 
walters the us ambassador at the united nations met with 
syrian president hafez assad in damascus syria 
im sure that the president is very much aware of the possible 
dangers and the possible advantages of such an action walters 
said 
the alittihad newspaper of abu dhabi reported sunday that 
hezbollah has pledged to safeguard all hostages held in the slums 
as part of a negotiated 8point agreement to regulate the syrian 
deployment 
the daily quoted unnamed sources in beirut as saying the pledge 
was made after syria warned that any harm befalling the hostages 
will be regarded as an aggressive act against syria 
hezbollahs spiritual guide sheikh mohammed hussein fadlallah 
said i feel with the families of the hostages and i am doing all 
i can to reach a happy ending 
fadlallah promised to invest all my energies to resolve the 
hostage problem and said i am still exerting pressure to reach a 
humanitarian solution he did not say who he was pressuring 
fadlallah released his statement late saturday through ray 
barnett a canadian clergyman who represents the usbased friends 
in the west a christian human rights group that has been working 
for release of the hostages 
barnett hoped to deliver to fadlallah a petition signed by 
40000 people from various countries pleading for the moslem 
clerics help to secure safe release of the hostages 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
fadlallah who lives in south beirut his twostory residence 
riddled with shell pocks and bullet scars has dropped his 
opposition to the entry of syrian forces into the slums 
the doors of the suburbs are open for the syrian army he 
said in an interview published sunday by the conservative beirut 
alanwar newspaper no party in the suburbs intends to confront 
the syrians 
the syrians massed troops tanks and armored vehicles around the 
slums after hezbollah overran amal positions to seize control of 90 
percent of the urban battle ground 
in previous statements fadlallah said there was no need for a 
syrian military intervention warning that the whole suburbs will 
be destroyed if the syrians move in 
shiite sources speaking on condition of anonymity attributed 
his change of stance to iranian pressure 
they said iranian mediators have told hezbollah leaders that 
iran views its alliance with syria in its war against iraq as more 
important than hezbollahs interests in lebanon 
syria considers lebanon to be within its sphere of influence it 
has been angered by irans attempt to use hezbollah to control the 
12 million shiites who make up the largest sect among lebanons 4 
million people 
irans deputy foreign ministers hossein sheikholeslam and ali 
mohammed besharati have been shuttling between damascus and beirut 
for two weeks to help end the fighting and avert a hezbollah 
collision with the syrian army

a dark cloud of controversy hangs over house 
impeachment proceedings against federal judge alcee l hastings of 
miami giving some members of the judiciary committees 
investigative panel an uncomfortable case of electionyear jitters 
the panel is moving reluctantly and with great caution for two 
reasons one concerns the possibility of setting a historic 
precedent the other is the question whether in 1988 when a black 
man is running for president america is truly colorblind 
the house has impeached 11 federal judges for high crimes and 
misdemeanors in its 200year history only five of them were 
subsequently convicted by the senate and removed from office 
but never has a federal judge been impeached after being 
acquitted of criminal charges according to the senate historians 
if impeached hastings would be the first 
his case also is unprecedented because hastings unlike all the 
other judges is black 
the racial issue clearly troubles rep john conyers jr 
dmich chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal 
justice which will resume its impeachment hearings on tuesday 
conyers who also is black complained at the very start of the 
hearings last week that the hastings case was exceedingly 
difficult and trying partly because of suggestions that the 
charges against floridas first black federal judge were racially 
and politically motivated 
other panel members seemed equally distressed liberal rep don 
edwards dcalif called it an unwelcome duty rep hamilton 
fish rny said it is not a pleasant responsibility to judge 
a federal judge 
frankly i dont want to be here this morning said rep mike 
synar dokla and im sure the judge doesnt either 
in an emotional opening statement delivered under oath hastings 
intensified the panels discomfort by reminding them that a trial 
jury had acquitted him five years ago of conspiring to solicit a 
150000 bribe from two convicted racketeers 
i am not guilty but i am not free hastings shouted 
demanding that his judges in the house set me free 
the subcommittee is looking into charges by a special fivejudge 
panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals that hastings 
actually committed the crime and tried to conceal his part in the 
bribery scheme by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his 
trial the panel investigated the case for 3 years 
conyers resurrected the racial issue when john doar chief 
counsel for the appellate panel outlined the massive evidence he 
had uncovered some of it unavailable to the miami trial jury to 
support the subcommittees charges of impeachable misconduct by 
hastings 
conyers repeatedly asked doar whether overt or even 
subconscious racism played any part in hastings prosecution or 
the subsequent investigation by his fellow judges 
absolutely not replied doar the respected former assistant 
us attorney general in charge of the justice departments civil 
rights division during the johnson administration 
rep george gekas rpa declared there had never been a 
hint that any part of the house panels own yearlong inquiry had 
been racially motivated 
conyers also evoked the specter of political intrigue when he 
charged that the federal judiciary had become conservatized and 
in some instances politicized under the reagan administration 
though prosecutors failed to make their case against hastings 
they did against his alleged coconspirator washington lawyer 
william a borders who was convicted in 1982 of arranging the 
bribe and was sentenced to five years in prison 
terence anderson of miami hastings chief counsel said 
prosecutors also succeeded in their aim of forcing hastings after 
borders arrest to remove himself from presiding over two major 
court cases in miami involving organized crime figures and haitian 
refugees both of highlevel interest in the justice department 
the political motivation behind hastings prosecution anderson 
said is a lingering issue that they the house panel are not 
looking at and wont if they can avoid it 
justice department spokesman john russell refused comment on 
andersons allegation 
the house subcommittee has subpoened borders in the hope of 
obtaining his crucial testimony especially about whether hastings 
was ever aware that his close friend was arranging a bribe for him 
borders has refused to testify against hastings at either of 
their separate trials nor did he ever appear before the judicial 
investigative panel

urban expansion and a terminal disease 
could wipe out australias koala bears within 10 years a leading 
veterinarian said sunday 
dr steve brown director of the world koala research corp 
said 35 million in research money was needed to help save the 
marsupials from extinction 
half of australias 200000 to 400000 koalas are suffering from 
chlamydia a sexually transmitted disease that causes blindness and 
infertility brown said at a news conference 
about 80 percent of their natural habitat has been destroyed 
and more is planned for conversion to farmland he said 
brown said little is known about the biology ecology and health 
of koalas because little research has been done on them 
scientists dont even know what constitutes an ideal environment 
for koalas or how many species of leaves they eat he said 
scientists have the laboratories the expertise and the staff 
to solve these questions but no money he said 
australians are so apathetic about their unique animals they 
dont even know they have already lost 17 native mammal species i 
dont think they even know theres 25 on an endangered list he 
said we have plundered this country its animals and its

the downhome sounds of the nashville bluegrass band were an

audience as part of a cultural exchange program sponsored by the 
us information service 
the lyrical content may not get across but the rhythms and 
beats and whats going on up on stage with the musicians will be 
picked up and enjoyed by the people said banjo player alan 
obryant 
obryant of reidsville nc believes music works as an 
ambassadorial tool because it can communicate with people in ways 
mere words cannot 
at a friday evening show at a local amusement park bahraini men 
in anklelength robes or dishdashas broke into traditional arab 
dancing that went on until dark when we couldnt even see our 
instruments any more said guitarist and lead singer pat enright 
of huntington ind 
everybody was trying to outdo everybody else one guy walked 
into the circle did a complete back flip and walked out again it 
was definitely the highlight of our visit he said 
although many arabs prefer traditional music western music is 
popular among the young 
the audience is more limited for such specialized music as 
bluegrass whose deep roots are said to lie in music taken to 
america by scottish and irish immigrants 
a us embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said bluegrass was chosen for this years ussponsored arts 
america program so people could experience music that shows the 
depth and breadth of america 
last years program in the middle east featured break dancing 
a handful of other countrybluegrass bands have visited the 
region in the past decade but appeared mostly at hotels catering to 
foreigners 
us embassies work with government officials to make sure 
performers and material are suitable for local audiences 
in islamic countries theres no place for gospel music with 
strong religious themes in some such as saudi arabia males and 
females do not appear together 
the allmale nashville band which also includes mandolin player 
mike compton fiddler stuart duncan and bassist mark hembree also 
scheduled stops in qatar bangladesh pakistan iraq and egypt 
but it may take a few more tours before my native home finds 
a home on arab radio station playlists 
yes ive heard this music before a youth at the amusement 
park told a reporter its from hawaii no

the tennessee legislature has quietly 
reeled in two more official state creatures 
without the ado that might muddy the water the lawmakers have 
approved resolutions so far in 1988 to name the catfish as the 
official tennessee commercial fish and the largemouth bass as the 
official tennessee game fish 
they join the passion flower as the state wildflower the iris 
as its cultivated flower the mockingbird as the official bird the 
tulip poplar as the state tree and the raccoon as tennessees wild 
animal 
theres also the firefly and the lady bug which jointly reign 
as the states insects thanks to a political compromise and 
perhaps thinking of their own words lawmakers designated the pearl 
as the state gem 
two separate legislative sessions designated pet rocks in 
1969 agate got the nod but in 1979 it was limestone 
but theres still no state vegetable a 1979 proposal to give 
the honor to corn was killed by a heavily democratic agriculture 
committee with the explanation that corn is a legume not a 
vegetable according to its sponsor former republican house member

democratic sen daniel patrick moynihan who 
plans to announce monday that hell seek a third term has 
republican leaders worried that he could win by a large enough 
margin to damage gop chances of carrying the state in the 
presidential race 
at the moment the likely republican challenger for the twoterm 
senator is robert mcmillan a littleknown long island lawyer 
this at best is going to be a tough state for vice 
president george bush and the few percentage points that moynihan 
might skew the election or that republican robert mcmillan might 
skew the election are important enough for them to go after said 
buffalos victor farley the erie county gop chairman 
i dont know that itll be a major factor but itll have an 
impact said richard rosenbaum a former state chairman and a 
republican national committeeman of the possible effect of the 
senate race on the presidential contest in new york 
john marino executive director of the state democratic 
committee and a political operative of gov mario cuomo calls the 
moynihan situation a reverse coattail effect 
in a close race at the top itll make a difference if 
moynihan can win by a twotoone margin and thats why jonathan 
bush got involved in trying to find an opponent said marino 
jonathan bush the vice presidents brother and a top republican 
fundraiser in new york has been encouraging mcmillan 55 to run 
mcmillan is expected to announce his candidacy early next month 
what has republicans worried is that without a strong challenge 
to moynihan some potential gop voters may simply stay home in 
november and thus deny bush needed votes in a close race 
initially republicans had expected to have a celebrity 
candidate there was speculation that former us secretary of 
state henry kissinger might be interested he wasnt rudolph 
giuliani the new york citybased federal prosecutor who had made a 
name for himself convicting mafia chieftains and corrupt 
politicians kept republican leaders hanging for months before 
finally bowing out earlier this year 
i think hes vulnerable rep jack kemp rny said of 
moynihan but theres no one in the giuliani or kissinger class 
to run 
kemp after his bid for the gop presidential nomination 
collapsed this spring was mentioned as a possible moynihan 
opponent 
i thought it was too late for me to shift gears kemp said 
of his decision not to run 
state comptroller edward regan a proven strong draw for 
republicans said he viewed the us senate as a demotion when 
he declined 
former us ambassador to austria ronald lauder son of 
cosmetics magnate estee lauder said he wanted to spend time with 
his family 
farley said some of the potential bigname candidates were 
scared off by the money needed for the race and moynihans apparent 
strength with the new york electorate 
big names have big egos said farley big egos dont want 
to be deflated and since they dont want to be deflated theyre 
looking for a sure thing so you only get someone who wants to move 
up 
you give me a weak incumbent and youll find plenty of 
republicans cuomo said 
of those new yorkers polled in january by the marist college 
institute for public opinion more than 57 percent said moynihan 
had done a good or excellent job and 45 percent said they 
definitely plan to vote for him 
already moynihan has raised more than 36 million for his 
reelection campaign and spent about 2 million hes expected to 
easily raise several million more 
republican leaders are assuring mcmillan they can raise the 3 
million he said he needs for the race but the gop has had 
difficulty in raising big money for candidates since the late gov 
nelson rockefeller left office in late 1973 to become vice 
president under gerald ford

iran said sunday it was carrying out 
major military maneuvers involving warplanes and more than 50 ships 
in the persian gulf and waters just outside 
tehran radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp said 
helicopters air force fighter planes and the airborne brigade of 
the army also were participating in the exercises 
the report appeared to indicate that virtually all of irans 
biggest naval vessels were involved in the exercises codenamed 
zolfaqar in the persian gulf gulf of oman and indian ocean 
the radio quoted a capt shirazi whom it identified as naval 
commander in chabahar as saying in an interview that 
missilecarrying destroyers heavy destroyers missilelaunching 
frigates and personnel carriers would be taking part in the 
maneuvers 
the iranians lost six naval vessels in a major clash with the 
us navy on april 18 
iran announced more than a week ago that it was planning to 
stage naval exercises in the strait of hormuz the gateway to the 
gulf to show that it remained a major power in the area 
gulf shipping officials and us intelligence sources at the 
pentagon in washington recently reported an increase in the numbers 
and activities of irans fleet of small armed speedboats around the 
bandar abbas naval base in the strait of hormuz 
since the battle with us forces iranian revolutionary guards 
have carried out three known speedboat attacks on neutral ships in 
the strait one on april 24 and two last week 
iranian patrol boats also have been intercepting vessels passing 
through the hormuz strait to check for cargoes bound for iraq its 
foe in a nearly 8yearold war 
a war communique quoted by the official islamic republic news 
agency did not mention naval maneuvers but said iranian air force 
planes flew routine patrol missions over the persian gulf and 
gulf of oman in support of the navy reconnoitering 21 vessels in 
the waterway 
in the april 18 fighting the 1540ton frigate sahand was sunk 
and a sister ship the sabalan was disabled other losses included 
a kamanclass patrol boat sunk after it fired a missile at a us 
warship and missed and three speedboats 
iran said 44 of its men were killed in the clashes triggered by 
us attacks that destroyed two iranian oil platforms in the south 
central gulf the united states said those attacks were in reprisal 
for iranian mining of gulf waters 
us officials say that despite the setbacks iran remains a 
potent naval force whose threats of revenge for the april 18 losses 
cannot be taken lightly 
adm william j crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said during a military awards ceremony may 5 that the iranians 
have a considerable capability and they have standoff missile 
capability which we are always concerned about 
h2ans navy includes two former us destroyers a british 
destroyer and two corvettes all of world war ii vintage and 
three supply ships two of which are sometimes used for naval 
patrol operations in the southern gulf 
the destroyers and corvettes have not been sighted in recent 
months and their operational status is unclear us officers say 
iran also has 10 fastattack patrol craft like the one sunk on 
april 18 and perhaps 100 speedboats equipped with a variety of 
weapons including recoilless rifles antiaircraft guns heavy 
machine guns and rocketpropelled grenade launchers

while most politicians crave seeing their 
faces on the television news or reading their names in newspapers 
michael dukakis often acts indifferent to that aspect of 
campaigning 
as the democratic presidential frontrunner campaigned through 
critically important california he repeatedly passed up easy 
chances to add to george bushs discomfort over the 
administrations handling of panamanian military leader manuel 
antonio noriega 
im going to do everything i can to stay positive he said 
when asked on his campaign plane why he had avoided direct 
criticism of the man certain to be his republican opponent in the 
fall 
dukakis fierce determination to do it his way distinguishes his 
campaign from those of any other presidential candidates this or 
any other campaign year 
and while the dukakis style may seem odd to observers accustomed 
to traditional campaigns no one can argue with its success 
in just over two weeks when the last four democratic primaries 
are held june 7 dukakis is certain to collect enough delegates to 
give him more than the 2081 needed to clinch his partys 
presidential nomination 
as the primary season progressed dukakis often was criticized 
as dull and passionless a speaker with all the impact of sodium 
pentathol 
but out of the initially large democratic field only jesse 
jackson remains to challenge him 
one thing the massachusetts governor may have in common with a 
select number of past presidential candidates is the ability to 
represent what many voters are looking for 
in 1960 john f kennedy excited voters because he represented 
generational change in 1976 jimmy carter campaigned as an 
outsider in a year voters were fed up with the washington insiders 
whod brought them vietnam and watergate 
dukakis exudes handson competence at a time when opinion polls 
suggest americans are looking for a change from the handsoff style 
of president reagan 
sometimes dukakis goes out of his way to stay out of sight of 
the media 
he runs around closing events that we scheduled as open 
said campaign adviser anthony podesta 
the candidate often speaks at schools and when he does he meets 
privately before his speech with a group of students 
he said he started doing that a few years ago when he became 
concerned about the extent of drug and alcohol abuse in schools 
id go into a school and people would say weve got a great 
program he said 
i finally said look before i do these assemblies id like 
to meet with a crosssection of the kids 25 or 30 just me no 
adults no teachers 
at those sessions he said he got a much more accurate picture 
of what was happening in the schools 
would he continue holding such meetings as president 
i expect to he said 
dukakis attacks the administration for its handling of the 
noriega affair while avoiding direct personal attacks 
with the tone of an outraged manager dukakis demanded an 
explanation of why the administration was doing business with 
noriega 
we wont be doing business with drugpeddling panamanian 
dictators is a stock line in the dukakis stump speech 
but when he was asked to comment on the latest reports of a 
pending deal that would have noriega relinquish power in exchange 
for the united states dropping drug charges against him dukakis 
would only say i dont know anything about it 
when asked about reports that bush was separating himself from 
reagan on the question of negotiations with noriega dukakis 
refused to take a shot at the vice president 
talking later about his determination to wage a positive 
campaign he said the bush campaign went negative for three 
weeks and all it did was hurt them 
he is convinced that the american peoplke are fed up with 
that they dont want to know what he thinks of me or i think of 
him 
they want to know which one of us has the stuff to do this job 
and what were for and thats what im going to do 
but dukakis also passes up one of the most timetested ways 
candidates get across to voters what they stand for and what they 
would do as president 
one of the most common occurences on the campaign of a 
challenger to an incumbent administration is for that candidate to 
approach reporters often the first thing in the morning and offer 
his views on the biggest news of the day 
but not on the dukakis campaign rarely does he vary from his 
carefully structured appearances

singersongwriter carole king says timber 
companies are asking for a kind of welfare and she doesnt want to 
see them get it 
king also a wilderness advocate says timber companies want to 
harvest more trees in idaho but need the us forest service to 
build roads at taxpayers expense to get to them 
the cost of building the roads in many cases is greater than the 
money the forest service collects for the trees king told about 
100 people attending the idaho conservation league annual meeting 
friday she also sang a few songs accompanying herself on the 
guitar 
while she urges setting aside land for the public king had her 
own tussle with the forest service and custer county over access to 
property in the county where she lives 
when she bought robinson bar ranch she locked a gate on a road 
through her property and contended that her rights were violated 
when the county declared the road public the forest service 
claimed the closure blocked public access to public lands 
the idaho supreme court ruled feb 10 that the property belongs 
to king and her husband rick sorensen and there is no public 
access involved 
i protected my rights and now i am working to protect 
everyones rights king said

willie nelson says he never wanted to get 
involved with politics prior to his involvement in the first farm 
aid concert 
the country music star thought he was playing just another 
charity show when he helped neil young and john mellencamp 
organize the benefit performance on behalf of financially strapped 
farmers 
instead farm aid has become a 4yearold effort that has led 
nelson to become politically active and has required that he spend 
much more time than he anticipated trying to help the family farmer 
ill be honest with you i never really wanted to get involved 
with politics i always felt that was something the other guy 
should do and i should sit on the side and criticize nelson 
said but when i got into farm aid and into the farm situation 
it wasnt possible for me to say i dont want to do anything 
anymore 
for the past three years nelson has rounded up his friends to 
play a giant concert to benefit family farmers those three 
concerts raised more than 10 million for farmers but no such 
concert will be held in 1988 and nelson said it is unlikely there 
will ever be another farm aid show 
i never say never but right now its time for the 
politicians to do their share he said

legal wrangling threatens to prevent a pair 
of giant pandas from being put on public display despite the 
excitement the bearlike creatures have stirred up here 
yes we wish there wasnt so much controversy surrounding 
their visit but they are here now and hopefully we can put this 
all behind us soon toledo zoo spokeswoman betsy clark said 
although the zoo hopes to start exhibiting le le and nan nan on 
tuesday it still must clear at least two hurdles before showing 
the pandas of which fewer than 1000 are thought to exist 
the us fish and wildlife service which said the animals 
entered the united states without proper documentation has given 
the zoo until saturday to correct the problem wildlife service 
spokesman david klinger said 
the pandas will not be displayed until the paper work is in 
order and if the matter is not cleared up le le and nan nan will 
be sent back to china he said 
zoo officials said they have a representative in china trying to 
clear up the problem 
at the same time the world wildlife fund and the american 
association of zoological parks and aquariums are trying to stop 
the zoos display with a federal lawsuit 
the groups contend that exhibition of the pandas violates the 
international convention that prohibits trafficking in endangered 
species for commercial purposes the toledo zoo has filed a 
countersuit charging harassment 
still some zoo officials are trying not to let the legal 
hassles put a damper on their panda plans it still is very 
exciting i just wish we could show the public how cute they are 
ms clark said 
indeed this city of 340000 along the banks of the maumee river 
in northwest ohio has seemingly caught panda mania 
stores in downtown toledo are stocked with panda souvenirs such 
as tshirts with pandas saying meet me in toledo and hats and 
drinking cups with pandas emblazoned on them grocery and 
department stores are offering panda sales and panda flags fly 
from houses in some neighborhoods 
china gave two pandas to the national zoo in washington in the 
early 1970s but china has only lent pandas to a few other zoos in 
the united states none as small as toledo 
the wildlife fund has questioned chinas use of fees it charges 
for panda loans it also has been pressuring the wildlife service 
part of the us interior department to stop what it calls chinas 
rentapanda policy until china can prove it is using those fees to 
preserve its pandas 
edwin bergsmark president of the toledo zoological society and 
the driving force behind the panda loan said the chinese have 
taken great offense at the wildlife funds implicit criticism and 
condemnation of chinese conservation efforts 
but wildlife fund spokesman kenneth cook said the animals are 
being displayed for profit he said the exhibition would increase 
the demand for such transactions from other zoos and hurt the 
effort to breed pandas 
toledo expects attendance to double this summer to about 10000 
people a day during the animals stay 
zoo officials spent nearly 3 million preparing for the pandas 
visit and gave the chinese about 300000 in equipment and 
technical help in exchange for the panda loan 
pandas are the national symbol of china and long have been 
regarded by the chinese as the ultimate gesture of goodwill and 
friendship

the last soviet troops on sunday pulled out of 
jalalabad and arrived in the capital kabul the tass news agency 
reported 
the withdrawal paved the way for a rebel attack on jalalabad a 
strategic northeastern city anticommunist forces have said they 
would invade jalalabad once the soviet troops were gone 
tass said withdrawal of the convoy left no soviet troops in the 
province of nangarhar in northeast afghanistan near the border 
with pakistan 
the brief dispatch did not say how many troops were in the 
convoy the latest in a series to make the 88mile trip to kabul 
from jalalabad 
the convoy will rest in the capital before traveling an 
additional 200 miles to the soviet city of termez 
the first convoy headed out from jalalabad on may 15 and was 
greeted in kabul with marching bands and speeches by afghan 
officials including president najib 
on saturday tass said a second military unit from afghanistan 
arrived in termez and was welcomed by relatives and friends city 
officials and youth delegations from several soviet republics 
under an agreement signed in geneva on april 14 an estimated 
115000 soviet soldiers who have been helping the afghan government 
in its war with antimarxist guerrillas are to be out within nine 
months 
the communist party daily pravda on sunday repeated what has 
become daily soviet media criticism of the united states and 
pakistan for continuing to supply weapons to the guerrillas who 
have been fighting the kabul government since a 1978 communist coup 
the heart of the geneva agreements on which stand the 
signatures of representatives of the usa and pakistan is simple 
and understandable the fate of afghanistan should be decided by 
the afghan people themselves and only themselves pravda said 
the newspaper cited western reports that the afghan rebels are 
feverishly shipping military equipment from bases in pakistan to 
facilities in afghanistan 
it said several hotheads in washington are discussing how 
the rebels will take control of afghan cities and form a 
provisional government but the rebels are not as strong as some 
people in the west think pravda said and the predictions of 
victory are overly optimistic

secretary of state george shultz saying its 
time to decide urged the senate on sunday to approve the 
ussoviet treaty banning mediumrange nuclear missiles in time 
for the summit between mikhail gorbachev and president reagan 
the secretary of state also echoed the positive remarks 
gorbachev made in an interview with us reporters in which the 
soviet leader said he hoped he could sign an agreement slashing in 
half the superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons before 
reagan leaves office 
its certainly possible shultz said of prospects for such a 
treaty speaking on abctvs this week with david brinkley the 
secretary added and i feel certain that at the moscow summit we 
will both want to agree to keep working on it hard but whether it 
will actually happen or not i dont know the issues are tough 
the president leaves wednesday stopping first in helsinki 
finland before traveling on to moscow for the may 29june 2 summit 
queried about talks on the disputed strategic defense 
initiative which has hampered agreement on a strategic missile 
pact shultz said reagan has staunchly opposed any impediment to 
the development of a defense against ballistic missiles 
that still leaves room for a lot of things the secretary 
said pointing to a period of nonwithdrawal from the 
antiballistic missile treaty which the soviets contend bars 
certain elements of the presidents spacebased missile defense 
program also known as star wars 
on saturday reagan used his radio address to appeal for 
ratification of the mediumrange missile treaty formally known as 
the pact on intermediate range nuclear forces 
it was signed by the two leaders at their december summit in 
washington and administration officials are eager to display the 
ratified treaty as a boost for the president in his negotiations 
with gorbachev 
while the senate has turned aside a wave of amendments designed 
by its conservative opponents to kill the treaty debate is 
expected to continue through much of the week approval of the pact 
requires 67 votes if all 100 senators are present 
shultz who is to carry his campaign for the pact to capitol 
hill on monday pointed out that more than a dozen years have 
passed since the united states has ratified a treaty with the 
soviet union and that it would help the president in his efforts 
at the summit if the treaty were approved 
it helps certainly to have completed something and to register 
that fact its good to register the fact that we can do it 
shultz said 
the secretary avoiding any criticism of the presidents 
conservative allies who oppose the treaty lauded the senate for 
its thorough consideration of the pact 
i think the process has gone well i have only compliments for 
the senate and the way in which theyve handled this he said 
adding i think theres been a time for hearings a time for 
questions a time for critiques and a time for debate there also 
has to come a time to decide and i think were about there 
appearing on the same program sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the armed services committee said he believed the treaty will be 
ready in time for the two leaders to sign 
we will finish the inf treaty prior not to the president 
departing but prior to the actual meetings he said adding 
thats a guess and i give it 6040 odds 
senate whip alan cranston dcalif said hes counted some 78 
very firm votes for the treaty i dont think the president 
should go emptyhanded said cranston appearing on nbctvs 
meet the press 
on the same show treaty opponent sen gordon humphrey rnh 
called the pact very onesided and very very dangerous and 
one that would allow the soviets an unfair advantage 
the spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry gennady 
gerasimov said on the same show that us officials had predicted 
at the december summit that the treaty would be ratified by april 
and now it is may we simply expect that if you promise then 
you must deliver but we also understand your political system 
gerasimov said 
he said it would be considered a good sign of your willingness 
to improve relations between our countries if you ratify the treaty 
by the time of the moscow summit

a zimbabwe newspaper said sunday that 
black extras in a usproduced antiapartheid movie are angry 
because a dog was paid more than they were during filming 
the stateowned sunday mail reported that the dog was earning 
twice the 15 a day black extras were paid in zimbabwe the 
minimum monthly wage is 54 dollars 
personally i am shocked that animals can earn more than 
humans said lucas tavaya a zimbabwe information department 
official 
but a spokeswoman for the information department said everyone 
in the production of metrogoldwynmayers a dry white season 
including the extras received fair pay 
the allegations are a pack of mischievous lies said 
beverley tilley a zimbabwean who coordinates film making for the 
information department 
the dog was hired from a professional doghandler and trainer 
and it does earn more than extras both black and white she 
told the associated press but there are some black zimbabweans 
in the technical crew earning up to 4000 a month 
mgm representatives have refused to discuss the row over the 
animal 
the film stars marlon brando and is based on a book by south 
african novelist andre brink it focuses on the subject of 
apartheid south africas system of racial segregation in which the 
black majority has no voice in national affairs 
ms tilley told the newspaper she feared that because the movie 
was about apartheid the south africans could be manipulating 
someone who in turn was responsible for alleged problems at the 
shooting of a dry white season 
the mail quoting a spokesman for the black extras who were not 
identified said the amount the dog is earning is too much to 
maintain an animal it has taken part in a few of the episodes 
this is an ironic case of an organization seeking to expose 
apartheid 
the extras also said they wanted the government to appoint more 
blacks to key positions in the information department which 
coordinates film making in this country 
ms tilley told the ap that complaints over extras pay rates 
had been raised in previous films shot in zimbabwe and she said 
similar bad publicity could hurt the countrys efforts to attract 
international film makers

a strong earthquake sunday hit the western 
island of cephalonia and triggered a landslide but that didnt 
surprise greek scientists they said they predicted the quake the 
night before 
there were no reports of casualties or building damage but the 
quake shook everybody awake this morning said a police officer 
on the island 
the athens seismological institute said the quake registered 55 
on the richter scale and hit at 644 am it was the second strong 
quake to hit the island in five days 
the seismological institute said sundays tremor was centered 
about 187 miles west of the capital in the ionian seabed close to 
cephalonia 
on saturday night athens university scientists monitoring the 
earths electrical field predicted the quake 
professor panayotis varotsos a physicist who developed the 
seismic prediction method in the early 1980s said it was the 
second time in a week the system worked with real accuracy 
we sent a telegram to the coministerial committee on 
earthquakes last night that predicted the timing strength and 
location of todays earthquake varotsos said in an interview 
with the associated press 
officials on the committee could not be immediately reached for 
comment 
varotsos telegram timed at 830 pm saturday predicted a 53 
quake with an epicenter identical to that of the real quake 
we said the quake was an aftershock to last wednesdays 
earthquake and would therefore occur within seven hours he said 
on wednesday a tremor measuring 58 on the richter scale shook 
cephalonia and parts of western greece cracking village houses in 
the aetoliaacharnania province on the mainland there were no 
reports of injuries 
varotsos monitoring team had predicted wednesdays quake three 
days earlier in a similar telegram to the committee which helps 
fund his research 
the richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake 
through the ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 6 severe damage a 7 reading is a 
major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage 8 is a 
great quake capable of tremendous damage 
on cephalonia a police officer said sundays quake triggered a 
landslide that blocked a road near the islands main town of 
argostoli 
the police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
there were no reports of casualties or cracked buildings on the 
island 
structures on quakeprone cephalonia are built to resist 
earthquakes of more than 7 on the richter scale 
in august 1953 a disastrous earthquake in the ionian islands 
off western greece killed more than 400 people and leveled more 
than 25000 houses on cephalonia and the nearby islands of ithaca 
and zakynthos 
since 1983 varotsos and his team have operated 18 monitoring 
stations on mainland greece that track electrical impulses emitted 
from the earth 
this weeks predictions were the most successful ever 
experience is finetuning the method he said 
using electrodes inserted six feet into the ground and an 
amplifier linked to a microcomputer the scientists keep a 24hour 
watch for variations in the earths electric field that would 
indicate an earthquake was building 
before an earthquake occurs there are stresses in the ground 
that cause emissions of different electrical signals varotsos 
said 
he said the time lag between changes in the electrical field 
ranged from seven hours to one week but that usually the quake 
strikes within 4560 hours 
varotsos said that by increasing the number of monitoring 
stations to around 40 including some on the aegean islands it 
should be possible to accurately predict every tremor in the region 
over 5 richter 
varotsos said similar sensor networks have been installed in 
japan in a research program operated by tokyo university 
seismologists 
he described the theoretical background to his earthquake 
forecasting methods in a book published in the netherlands in 1986 
and in articles in an amsterdambased scientific journal 
tectonophysics

janos kadar replaced as communist 
party leader sunday after 32 years in power emerged from a 
discredited stalinist regime to guide hungary to relative 
prosperity and a tolerance rare in the soviet bloc 
but kadars popularity at home and abroad faded in the 1980s as 
hungarys brand of communism for the consumer ran into mounting 
difficulties that fueled demands for political reform 
kadar who turns 76 thursday resisted calls for his ouster for 
at least two years prior his replacement by 57yearold karoly 
grosz 
after world war ii kadar was jailed and then freed by his 
political peers during a purge of party ranks but he took control 
in 1956 when hungary was stunned by the brutal quashing of an 
antisoviet revolt 
it was kadar who urged moscow to send in troops and tanks 
against the rebels and it was kadar who presided over the 
subsequent repression that culminated in the june 1958 execution of 
imre nagy the government head during the revolt 
within four months of nagys execution kadar found the formula 
that helped him heal the wounds of 1956 he pledged to raise living 
standards and in the next 25 years presided over reforms that 
fostered growing prosperity at home and won over western nations 
who refused to accept him as leader after 1956 
the reversal typified his upanddown career 
born in 1912 in what is now the yugoslav port of rijeka kadar 
was raised by peasants until age 6 when his semiliterate mother 
took him to budapest 
after eight years school kadar became a worker joining the 
illegal communist party in 1931 and rising swiftly 
by 1948 kadar was deputy party leader and interior minister it 
has never been clear however whether he controlled brutal purges 
of political and religious opponents at that time 
party leader matyas rakosi a stalinist watched kadars rise 
jealously in 1951 kadar was arrested and jailed on charges never 
made public winning freedom again only in 1954 when rakosis star 
faded following the death of soviet leader josef stalin in 1953 
kadars topsyturvy early career and the poverty of his 
childhood likely taught him the necessity of compromise and of 
trying to give citizens a good life 
by 1968 kadar had steered through a socalled new economic 
mechanism that legalized market reforms already in place but never 
fully realized its declared aim of abandoning centralized planning 
while kadars reforms reputedly got a cool reception in moscow 
the wily hungary leader avoided the fate of fellow reformer 
alexander dubcek czechoslovakias liberal prague spring was 
crushed by a 1968 warsaw pact invasion in which kadars troops took 
part 
in the 1970s kadar boosted living standards and tolerated a 
degree of political discussion then unknown in the soviet bloc 
but the crisis that was to undo kadar slowly mounted western 
credits that helped fuel the consumer boom turned into a huge 
foreign debt exports slumped and many staterun firms became 
unprofitable 
an austerity program was finally adopted last year to revamp the 
economy but only fueled discontent in the end reformers 
outweighed kadars traditional worker and party supporters pushing 
him aside to make way for grosz

of the good life not unlike their american counterparts the 
yuppies reports money magazine 
in its june issue the business magazine profiles a moscow 
couple valentin and ludmilla kaganovich who enjoy the trappings 
of western young upscale professionals 
both are dentists whose combined annual earnings of 13200

families 
the couple pays the equivalent of 39 a month rent for their 
apartment on fashionable gorky street they own a country home a 
new car color television set and a vcr which cost 2550 or 
about six months wages for the average soviet worker 
kaganovich charted the way for his familys high standard of 
living by operating a private dental practice while for 15 years 
continuing to work at a staterun clinic 
but before gorbachev people treated me like a bandit even 
when i worked like a dog kaganovich said now people treat me 
with respect 
still besides a high income living the good life in moscow 
requires good connections the magazine reports in a city where 
consumers face shortages of so many things money can be relatively 
worthless without a network of friends and acquaintances with whom 
to barter 
if you have friends working in shops theyll set nice things

the government has given the 
international committee of the red cross 15 days to free tons of 
relief food and other items locked in its stores in the wartorn 
northern provinces of tigre and eritrea 
the ministry of foreign affairs said in letter to jeanjacque 
fresard red cross representative in ethiopia that the stored food 
is unjustifiably sustaining damage as a result of the 
indifference deliberately and consciously pursued by icrc 
the letter told the red cross that the government will take any 
measure it considers appropriate if the food is not handed over to 
ethiopian authorities within 15 days 
ethiopia in early april ordered all foreign relief workers out 
of eritrea and tigre for security reasons four un workers were 
allowed to continue relief operations after a senior un official 
met with president mengistu haile mariam 
rebels have been fighting for 27 years in eritrea and for 14 
years in tigre 
the order for relief workers to leave was issued as the 
government prepared for a counteroffensive following a series of 
victories by the rebels 
international red cross first said it was defying the order to 
recall its 25 or so workers citing a humanitarian responsibility 
for the fate of some 5 million people in the two droughtstricken 
provinces 
when the government insisted that the red cross workers leave 
the areas the agency locked up its supplies and trucks and left 
red cross officials have denied earlier requests to hand over 
the food because they said they must be present to supervise the 
foods distribution in the past there have been allegations that 
food destined for starving farmers has gone to feed ethiopian 
soldiers

black louisiana lawmakers will fight 
legislation making cajuns a legally recognized minority in the 
state because the measure threatens black economic development 
state sen jon johnson said sunday 
a measure granting cajuns minority status was approved 7422 in 
the state house of representatives wednesday over the objections of 
black lawmakers they claim counting cajuns as minorities would 
dilute the black share of jobs on state projects that must by law 
hire 10 percent minority workers 
the bill is now in the hands of the state senate where johnson 
a member of the legislative black caucus said it must be killed 
i for one have absolutely no intention at all of letting a 
group of individuals who have enjoyed anything from serving as 
governor of this state on down who are going to come in and make an 
attempt to share as a minority said johnson a new orleans 
democrat 
cajuns are descendants of french settlers expelled from canada 
who settled in the steamy bayou country of south louisiana in the 
1750s the louisiana almanac estimates the number of cajuns in the 
state between 200000 and 300000 the states population is about 
4 million 
johnson said cajuns have achieved much in the state he noted

the communist party newspaper has rejected 
a new proposed marshall plan for poland in exchange for 
westerninspired democratic reform calling the idea alms that 
would in addition subjugate poland politically 
are we today going to experience new dependence on the west 
served in the wrapping of a new marshall plan trybuna ludu said 
in a commentary in its weekend edition this would be stupidity 
bordering on madness 
several western political commentators and leaders including 
former french president valery giscard destaing suggested the 
idea of a western bailout during polish labor unrest from april 25 
to may 10 such a plan would help poland with its huge foreign debt 
in exchange for democratization and other political reforms 
the 194851 marshall plan named after us secretary of state 
george marshall distributed 12 billion in foreign aid from the 
united states to rebuild western europe after world war ii the 
plan offered help to poland and other eastern european countries 
but it was rejected under pressure from the soviet union which saw 
it as a bid to bring those nations under american influence 
poland struggles with a foreign debt of 39 billion an aging 
industrial base 45 percent inflation and average incomes of about 
100 a month its leaders have long been critical of western 
countries saying they should do more to help 
but trybuna ludu the chief paper of the governing polish united 
workers party said the government would not sacrifice political 
beliefs for western aid 
such a plan is intended to change the power alignment in 
europe and represents an attempt to make a vassal out of 
poland the newspaper said

janos kadar leader of hungarys 
communist party since 1956 was replaced sunday by premier karoly 
grosz in a sweeping reshuffle that brought outspoken reformers into 
the ruling elite 
kadar also left the ruling politburo and was given the largely 
ceremonial post of party president in changes announced at the end 
of a threeday national party conference 
the 75yearold revolutionary increasingly seen as an obstacle 
to political change demanded by some party members had been 
expected to step down as general secretary of the communist party 
politburo member janos berecz told a packed news conference that 
kadar asked not to be nominated for the party leadership citing 
his age and what berecz termed the need for renewal 
the conference also appointed new more reformminded politburo 
and approved a policy document details of which were expected 
later sunday or on monday 
this conference marks a radical change grosz told hungarian 
television minutes after being named new party general secretary 
we have faced critically the errors committed earlier 
a new approach is needed in public life in production in 
human sectors and other fields said grosz who at 57 is a leader 
in the mold of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev with a vigorous 
public manner and a reputation as a pragmatist 
since becoming premier in june last year grosz has imposed 
austerity measures to try and reduce a net foreign debt of 109 
billion deregulate prices and close down lossmaking stateowned 
firms 
gorbachev on sunday cabled his congratulations to grosz the 
official soviet news agency tass reported 
gorbachev wished grosz success in tackling the tasks of 
improving and renovating the socialist society on hungarian soil 
tass said 
asked whether the soviet union was consulted about the change of 
power berecz told reporters nobody wants to believe that we 
make sovereign decisions although we do we intend to inform our 
friends of the new appointments and hope they will be received 
with support 
looking tired kadar gave a final speech to the party conference 
once the new leadership was announced gracefully thanking retirees 
for their past work and wishing newcomers success 
i twice spoke to this party conference and would not like to 
repeat myself kadar said i am convinced that these three days 
of hard work have been effective 
with the replacement of kadar bulgarias todor zhivkov is the 
last party leader surviving from the 1950s in the soviet bloc 
grosz becomes party leader of a revamped politburo trimmed of 
aging bureaucrats and stacked with reformers most notable among 
the liberals were imre pozsgay and reszo nyers the father of 
hungarys economic reform in the 1960s who was dropped from the 
politburo in 1973 
pozsgay has called on the government to allow trade unions and 
political organizations independent of the communist party 
the announcement that kadar was out as party leader was greeted 
with long enthusiastic applause by almost 1000 conference 
delegates 
this is an exceptional day for hungary said a prominent 
party official who supports reform we are proud that we have 
shown that it is possible to do this gracefully kadar was a great 
leader but was clearly no longer competent to hold power 
kadar is the first east bloc party boss to relinquish power 
after such an open debate on the merits of his leadership 
in december czechoslovak party leader gustav husak 75 was 
replaced by milos jakes a 65yearold party loyalist but the 
switch was made under the cloak of secrecy at a central committee 
meeting 
kadar took over the party leadership in 1956 after moscow 
brought in troops and tanks to quash an antisoviet revolt and 
arrested liberal leader imre nagy 
he won popularity at home and abroad by encouraging economic 
reforms that brought hungarian consumers prosperity and by 
tolerating a freedom of discussion rare in the soviet bloc in the 
1970s 
in a speech friday kadar denounced reformist efforts as threats 
to singleparty rule 
in a brief interview with hungarian television grosz asked for 
the support of hungarys 106 million citzens and said he will do 
his best so that the nation gets rid of its pressing problems 
hungarys a net foreign debt is the largest per capita in the 
east bloc inflation has touched 18 percent this year and more 
price rises and unemployment are expected as the austerity program 
grosz enacted in september takes hold 
asked about holding two offices grosz said he favored the 
earliest possible separation of his jobs as party head and premier 
in the sweeping upheaval of leading party organs the politburo 
shrank to 11 members from the previous 13 
eight old members of the politburo were dropped in the 
reshuffle a new 108member central committee replaced the former 
106member body with about onethird of old members failing to 
gain reelection to the new body

uniformed police officers will form a 
backdrop and presidential press secretary james brady will look on 
in an elaborate ceremony planned for signing of a bill banning the 
sale of cheap handguns in maryland 
gov william donald schaefer plans to sign the bill monday at 
the maryland state house where more than 200 police officers are 
expected to take part said luther starnes schaefers assistant 
press secretary 
the main speaker will be sarah brady who became active in 
guncontrol efforts nationally after her husband was seriously 
wounded in the assassination attempt on president reagan by john 
hinckley jr 
legislative leaders and other officials who helped push the bill 
through the general assembly last month also have been invited 
schaefer aides say the ceremony is not intended to send a 
message to progun groups that are collecting signatures on 
petitions to place the bill on the ballot for a public vote in 
november 
state officials characterize the bill as unique in that it sets 
up a board to determine what handguns can be sold in maryland 
beginning in 1990 it will be legal to possess guns approved by the 
review board but it will be against the law for anyone including 
private owners to sell weapons not on the approved list 
the law is primarily aimed at the cheap handguns known as 
saturday night specials that are often used in street crimes 
the review board also is directed to omit from the list of 
approved guns any weapons that have the serial number removed or 
altered and guns made primarily of plastic that arent easily 
detected by metal detectors 
weldon clark founder of a group called stop gun prohibition 
said his group is convinced it can easily collect the 33044 
signatures needed to force a referendum on the bill in november 
ted lattanzio the nras director of state and local affairs 
said the bill was steamrolled through the legislature in an 
atmosphere of emotional hysteria 
he said the public was deluded into thinking it the bill 
will have an impact on crime which it wont 
vincent demarco who resigned as an assistant state attorney 
general to head marylanders against handgun abuse said his group 
is concerned about a referendum even though public opinion polls 
show overwhelming support for a ban on the sale of saturday night 
specials 
the nra has won referendums in other states by spending a lot 
of money and misrepresenting the situation and telling people 
falsehoods he said

world chess champion gary kasparov 
defeated a dogged dutch opponent sunday to stake out a onepoint 
lead against archrival anatoly karpov in a fourplayer contest 
kasparovs seventhround victory came against john van der wiel 
and gave him the tournament lead over anatoly karpov a fellow 
soviet who is ranked second in the world karpov was held to a draw 
sunday by dutch champion jan timman ranked third in the world 
the fourway contest pits the worlds two leading players for 
the first time since kasparov retained his title last year in 
seville spain he beat karpov in 1985 to become world champion 
the tournament also marks kasparovs return to the international 
tournament arena after a nearly yearlong absence 
playing white against van der wiels queens indian defense 
kasparov soon got the upper hand sunday he forced his opponent 
into a cramped position and devastated his queens side pawn 
structure while gradually improving his own array 
halfway through the game van der wiel compounded his own 
problems by running into time trouble and kasparov seemed ready to 
deliver the coup de grace he grabbed control of the center and 
sacrificed an exchange to storm blacks kings side 
but with under 10 minutes on the clock for 20 moves separating 
him from time control van der wiel dug in his heels a desperate 
counteroffensive almost forced kasparov to return all his spoils 
but when the dutchman made it to the time check it turned out 
that the world champion had nicely calculated his chances with 
four pawns against his opponents three he was in winning position 
van der wiel resigned on his 45th when he stood to lose another 
pawn or go mate 
karpovs encounter with timman was more routine sometimes 
called viceworld champion karpov played black with his pet 
carokann defense and easily held the balance throughout the 
opening 
exasperated by karpovs conservative defensive play timman 
initiated a risky variation but got nowhere 
the two players continued until the 43rd exchanging pieces 
without really changing anything and then agreed to the draw 
kasparov was left in first place with five points and a record 
of three wins and four draws while karpov tallied four with two 
wins four draws and a loss 
timman was third with 3 points and van der wiel last with 1 
the tournament organized by the amsterdam european options 
exchange for its 10th anniversary was to continue monday kasparov 
plays timman with white and karpov faces van der wiel with black

hundreds of russian avantguard paintings banned 
from public view since 1932 will be displayed in leningrad and 
published under a joint americansoviet project this fall 
publishers said 
the collection of russian avantguard art including previously 
unexhibited works by kandinsky and malevich is believed to be the 
largest ever to be displayed in that country or published in the 
west paul gottleib publisher at harry n abrams inc said at a 
news conference here friday 
the company is producing the art book in conjunction with 
sovietsky khudozhnik the soviet art publishing house 
nearly all the artworks were produced legally before 1932 when 
the allunion congress of artists succumbed to a cultural chill 
under stalin and decreed that only socialist realism would be 
appropriate in the young communist country 
we professionals knew about this art even in the worst times 
but now under glasnost the new policy of openness the general 
audience is interested in anything particularly of the period 
before stalin said mikhail anikst creative director of the book 
project 
gottleib anikst and vladimir viktorovich gorianov a soviet 
publisher showed photographs of the works at the news conference 
the works of more than 170 artists most of whom are dead will 
be displayed for at least three months in leningrad but will not 
travel to other soviet museums no plans have been set for taking 
the exhibit outside the country gorianov said 
many russian avantguard artists who were among the leaders 
worldwide at the time continued to work illegally after 1932 and 
marked the birth of russian underground art said phyllis freemam

a rightwing government 
opponent on sunday called for suspending strategic mineral sales to 
the united states in response to threats of heavier us economic 
sanctions 
clive derbylewis of the conservative party urged a ban on sales 
of platinum and other key minerals that the united states obtains 
primarily from south africa 
why should south africa kowtow to the us he said in a 
statement the united states is deliberately undermining the 
economy of south africa at great cost to all of its inhabitants 
the united states is cynically oblivious to the double 
standards inherent in their policy of normal trade with the 
communist bloc countries who have no record whatsoever of human 
rights beliefs derbylewis said 
the us congress is weighing a sanctions package that would cut 
most bilateral economic ties in a bid to pressure south africa into 
speeding up race reform in 1986 congress placed limited sanctions 
on south africa 
south africa supplies about 80 percent of the platinum sold to 
the noncommunist world it has the worlds largest known reserves 
of strategic minerals such as manganese chromium vanadium and 
titanium 
the worlds other main supplier of strategic minerals is the 
soviet union 
foreign minister rolef pik botha reiterated last week the 
government has no intention of withholding strategic minerals to 
western nations even if they impose sanctions 
by law and custom south africas apartheid policies have 
established a racially segregated society in which the 26 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million whites 
control the economy and maintain separate districts schools and 
health services

laurie danns last day of life had a 
fearful toll one child dead and six people wounded a house fire 
and deliveries of poisoned food now authorities are struggling to 
understand her state of mind 
this is a seriously destroyed individual who lost control and 
acted out all of her delusions said harold visotsky professor 
and chairman of the department of psychiatry at northwestern 
university medical school 
ms dann shot herself to death friday after killing an 
8yearold boy and wounding five other children in a rampage at 
hubbard woods elementary school north of chicago 
she also shot a 20yearold man who tried to wrest a gun from 
her at a home nearby 
shortly before the shootings she delivered arseniclaced snacks 
and juice to two northwestern university fraternities and several 
homes where she had worked as a babysitter there were no serious 
injuries 
police said the death toll might have been higher had it not 
been for the actions of a substitute teacher at the elementary 
school who refused danns order to herd together the 24 children in 
her room instead the teacher grabbed the assailants gun hand 
but ms dann pulled out a second pistol and opened fire 
i just acted instinctually i just wanted to protect the 
children said the 29yearold teacher amy moses 
at a news conference sunday ms moses said i really just 
went on automatic pilot i cant explain how unreal the whole 
situation was 
in an interview sunday visotsky said ms dann probably had a 
symbolic reason for every one of the acts of violence 
visotsky said that ms dann probably saw herself as a victim and 
sought revenge against those who had diminished her sense of 
selfworth 
police chief herbert timm said there obviously is a 
connection with children here we dont know what 
elizabeth kaufman an acquaintance said sunday i know that 
she felt that she had no one to talk to 
i always thought she was a little bit odd but i always 
thought she was harmless she was a nice person ms kaufman said 
in a telephone interview from lubbock texas where she recently 
moved 
she was always trying to help people to be happy which is 
whats so strange about this 
meanwhile members of the clergy used sunday services to pray 
for the victims and ms dann six victims remained hospitalized 
four in serious condition and one in critical condition officials 
said 
today we will pray for laurie dann because for what she did 
she could not have been in her right mind the rev mike weston 
of sacred heart catholic church said and because she was once a 
child and a christian and because jesus prayed for his 
enemies 
visotsky agreed with police who believe the chain of violence 
probably was triggered when ms dann learned a family for whom she 
babysat planned to leave illinois 
police said that on the morning of the shootings ms dann set a 
small fire in the familys house and gave tainted milk to two of 
the familys children 
but her troubles had begun sooner 
authorities in arizona were ready to indict ms dann on charges 
of making threatening phone calls to a former boyfriend and lake 
county ill prosecutors planned similar charges in another case 
in madison wis where ms dann often lived police said they 
interviewed her five days before she died after they received 
reports she was acting erratically 
capt jeffrey frye said three madison officers and a resident 
manager at the towers a private dormitory complex near the 
university of wisconsinmadison campus entered ms danns room may 
15 with a master key and talked with her 
someone earlier had found her in a storage room in the towers 
covered with a plastic bag and sweating profusely frye said 
they determined there wasnt a whole lot they could do with 
her he said 
we had gotten some information that she may have a weapon 
or may have access to a 357magnum frye said no gun was found 
he said 
ms dann was due to stand trial in madison on charges of 
shoplifting several womens wigs march 14 
greg rogers owner of a card shop in madison said saturday that 
officiallooking letters addressed to ms dann at his store have 
been arriving for about 10 weeks but he said he did not know her 
or why mail for her would be coming to his address 
dr joseph flaherty professor of psychiatry and preventive 
medicine at the university of illinoischicago said ms dann may 
have suffered from a borderline personality disorder or paranoid 
psychosis 
people who suffer from these disorders develop a strong 
feeling that they have been wronged that people are against them 
and they should retaliate he said

a 22yearold pregnant woman was killed 
while talking on the telephone when a bolt of lightning struck the 
phone lines outside her house authorities said 
laura mcdowell who was eight months pregnant and the fetus 
died from lightning that struck about 5 pm saturday as a heavy 
band of thunderstorms moved through the central new york region 
cayuga county sheriffs deputies said emergency room doctors were 
unable to resuscitate ms mcdowell auburn memorial hospital 
nursing supervisor nancy purdy said 
ms mcdowells 3yearold daughter witnessed her mothers death 
and several of the victims relatives were sitting in the living 
room when the accident occurred 
ms mcdowells stepbrother allen harmon 17 told authorities 
the bolt knocked things off the wall and threw ms mcdowell from 
the chair in which she was sitting 
the phone was blackened by the electrical charge which 
authorities estimated was between 10000 and 50000 volts about 50 
volts can jog the human heart 
howard g williams a spokesman for new york telephone co said 
such a fatality was rare because although telephone lines carry low 
voltages they are grounded and insulated against transporting 
strong electrical charges 
however williams cautioned that it is still unwise to talk on 
the telephone during a thunderstorm because electricity can be 
drawn into the home on its way to the ground 
authorities said the exact cause of mcdowells death would be 
determined with an autopsy

georgias republican party could be left with 
two competing delegations to the partys national convention in new 
orleans this summer in the wake of a weekend dispute at the state 
gop convention 
atlanta lawyer matt patton took the podium at saturdays party 
convention after an angry walkout by gop chairman john stuckey who 
adjourned the meeting and left along with several hundred party 
regulars 
the more than 900 republicans who remained elected patton to 
preside and continued the convention on their own adopting a party 
platform and electing 18 atlarge delegates to the national 
republican convention in new orleans 
stuckey said he would convene a meeting of the partys state 
executive committee to select the official atlarge delegates 
leaving open the possibility of two georgia delegations showing up 
in new orleans 
thirty other gop delegates were already picked at district 
conventions 
stuckey had presided friday over an abbreviated session marked 
by chanting and booing by many of the 968 delegates mostly pat 
robertson supporters and newcomers to party politics who had been 
disqualified by the party regulars credentials committee 
the credentials committee complying with a court order 
considered and granted appeals by many of the disqualified 
delegates friday evening and on saturday party officials began 
the lengthy process of registering the official delegates 
but stuckey adjourned the convention saying it had been taken 
over by what he described as an unruly mob after leaving the 
platform he told reporters the court rulings would be appealed to 
the states highest court and if necessary the us supreme court 
carl gillis a national committeeman from adrian said the 
partys national credentials committee may have to decide which 
delegation to recognize 
this will probably wind up in an awful mess gillis added 
the general counsel for the national republican party said the 
partys ninemember contest committee will hear from both sides and 
report its findings to the partys credentials committee 
these people have done this job before and they play this game 
strictly by the book said roger allen moore of boston

the american civil liberties union 
will hold talks monday to try to find a way to override the wishes 
of convicted massmurderer r gene simmons and halt his planned 
execution an official said 
the aclu is concerned that simmons could go from trial to 
execution without a review by another court a situation 
unprecedented in recent us judicial history jay jacobson 
executive director of the aclus arkansas chapter said saturday 
the chapters executive committee agreed saturday to do 
something about the simmons case but it remains unclear what 
action the organization can take because it has no direct stake in 
the case jacobson said 
typically defendants or their close relatives appeal death 
sentences 
potential actions range from issuing a statement expressing 
disappointment at a lack of mandatory review to filing some sort 
of litigation jacobson said 
simmons was scheduled last week to die by injection on june 27 
for the dec 28 murders of kathy kendrick and david chaffin during 
a 45minute shooting rampage in russellville 
he has said no one should try to halt the execution which he 
described as correct punishment for his conviction for capital 
murder 
simmons also is scheduled to stand trial july 18 for the 
christmas holiday shooting and strangulation deaths of his wife 
rebecca and 13 other members of his family 
survivors of the family members want simmons tried for their 
deaths before he is executed for the two other slayings simmons 
sisterinlaw said 
edith nesby sister of rebecca simmons was quoted in the 
russellville courier democrat saturday as saying she and other 
survivors still cry for justice 
they cant put him to death three times thats true but when 
he does go to death we want him to go to death for all the 
deaths she was quoted as saying from briggsdale colo where 
the cremated remains of mrs simmons and four of her children are

president alan garcia paid a surprise 
visit sunday to an andean town where residents say troops killed 
dozens of people in retaliation for the guerrilla ambush of a 
military convoy 
democracy at times may make mistakes but its biggest mistake 
would be to hide anything garcia told reporters in ayacucho 
while a government communique earlier sunday said a ministerial 
commission denied reports of the killings garcia and a later 
government statement said an investigation will continue 
ayacuchos district attorney said troops killed at least 20 
peasants on may 14 in the town of cayara 30 miles south of the 
provincial capital and that soldiers were not cooperating with his 
investigation a congressional investigative commission said at 
least 30 were slain 
garcia flew to cayara in a military helicopter from ayacucho 
where he was attending a meeting of youth leaders of his 
centerleft aprista party he said he spoke with residents and 
officials in cayara 
garcia also met with carlos enrique escobar the states 
district attorney i know that yesterday was a visit by a 
ministerial commission but i would also like to listen to the 
point of view of dr escobar who has had some preoccupations that 
must be clarified garcia told reporters my suggestion will be 
that the commission that was here yesterday return accompanied with 
dr escobar 
garcia protected by heavy security said the investigation 
should continue in order to clarify exactly how many people died 
and their cause of death 
a communique signed by prime minister armando villanueva in 
lima the nations capital said a government investigative 
commission visited the town saturday and found no evidence of a 
massacre 
the statement said testimony from villagers proved the 
falsehood of reports of rapes of women houseburnings 
bombardments assassination of children a hundred deaths and other 
acts of genocide 
but in a second communique issued sunday night the lima 
government said testimony gathered from townspeople indicated 
unclarified armed acts took place in the village and said the 
investigation would continue 
the government said it was ordering the military command in 
ayacucho high in the andes 230 miles southeast of lima to 
cooperate fully with the investigation being conducted by the 
district attorneys office 
the government commission was composed of defense minister gen 
enrique lopez albujar justice minister camilo carrillo raul 
ferrero costa president of the lima law association and monsignor 
augusto beuzeville ferro assistant bishop of lima 
survivors of the alleged massacre made a formal denunciation 
thursday of an attack by army troops may 14 against cayara a town 
of 1500 people 
the survivors said in a statement that army troops killed 47 men 
between the ages of 15 and 62 including eight high school 
students their principal the towns justice of peace and the 
cayara prefect a position with duties similar to those of a police 
chief 
the statement said 51 other people were missing including women 
who had been raped by troops 
escobar said he visited cayara saturday with a coroner and his 
assistants and had seen at least four burned homes he said that 
based on interviews with survivors he determined at least 20 
villagers were killed by troops 
escobar said troops guarding the entrance to cayara would not 
let the autopsy team enter the town and would not give him 
permission to dig up an area where survivors said dozens of victims 
had been buried by troops 
the four members of a congressional team also returned to 
ayacucho sunday after visiting cayara and told reporters they found 
evidence of the slaying of at least 30 noncombatants 
gen cesar valdivia military commander of the ayacucho region 
told reporters some 200 guerrillas had ambushed an army patrol two 
miles outside cayara the day before the alleged massacre 
it is evident that a good proportion of the personnel that 
participated in the ambush comes from the community of cayara 
because it is considered controlled by the terrorists he said 
the impoverished highlands surrounding this provincial capital 
were the birthplace of the shining path insurgency eight years ago 
this month and remain the stronghold of the maoist guerrillas 
the area has been under military control since late 1982 
more than 10000 people have been killed in the violence since 
1980 most of them highland peasants caught in the crossfire 
between guerrillas and security forces 
in the two largest massacres on record the shining path is 
blamed for the slaughter of 83 peasants in 1983 and army troops for 
the slaying of 69 villagers in 1985

after a year of layoffs and slowdowns minicomputer makers 
clustered along the route 128 beltway around boston are refocusing 
their marketing and production tactics and forming business 
alliances considered taboo a short time ago 
the main reason for the changes has been the advent of personal 
computers that can do some minicomputer jobs for a lot less money 
the focus of this business is pcs now said john mccarthy of 
forrester research inc in cambridge which tracks technology 
management trends thats whats creating the excitement its 
not mainframes and its not minicomputers 
minicomputers which come as small as singledrawer filing 
cabinets but do not sit on desks are used for heavy computation 
in fields such as science and engineering accounting travel 
inventory management and office automation 
in minicomputers the central device is the brains of the system 
while the terminals are dumb with personal computers 
intelligence is located in each computer 
as processing capabilities of personal computers increase price 
is becoming a key factor separating minis and pcs todays standard 
price range for minicomputers is 8000 to 12000 per user 
desktop pcs cost from 4000 to 8000 
minicomputer vendors dont understand how to achieve the same 
price levels as pcs yet they have no performance advantage to 
offer said aaron goldberg vice president for minicomputer 
services at international data corp of course the customers are 
opting for the lower price alternative 
idc a market researcher forecasts a 17 percent growth in us 
personal computer sales this year against 7 percent for 
minicomputers sales of minicomputers totaled 138 billion in 1987 
in the country compared to 205 billion for personal computers 
instead of buying one minicomputer many companies are linking 
together personal computers through local area networks and then 
using one common pc to store information analysts said 
under the most dire predictions minicomputer use may be 
restricted to providing services for personal computer networks by 
the mid1990s 
the first minicomputer company digital equipment corp was 
founded in 1957 in the corner of an old woolen mill the 
maynardbased company grew into the worlds second largest computer 
maker after international business machines corp 
other minicomputer makers that located in the hightech corridor 
outside boston include data general corp in westboro wang 
laboratories inc in lowell prime computer inc in natick and 
computer consoles inc in waltham 
business began to pick up in the early 1970s and surged through 
1985 when an industrywide slump hit and the personal computer 
began redefining the business 
one scenario is that businesses will rely on large mainframes 
for large computing needs and personal computers for deskwork 
leaving the midrange minicomputers out in the cold one industry 
analyst forecast that about 65 percent of the market will opt for 
the twotiered approach 
the costs are staggering in terms of what this could do 
said howard anderson managing director of the yankee group 
thats where the battle is going to be waged 
digital equipment challenging ibm on its own mainframe turf 
has begun offering clusters of powerful minicomputers that add up 
to nearly the power of a big mainframe 
minicomputer makers also are coming to grips with the emergence 
of standard operating systems which allow popular software 
packages to be used on a variety of different computers 
the most popular standard operating system is american telephone 
amp telegraph cos unix a base layer of software in a computer that 
serves as a traffic cop for its internal operations 
the threat to large computer vendors is simple unix frees users 
from being tied to a single proprietary software limited to a 
particular computer on the other hand unix is good for small 
companies that want to steal business away from the likes of 
digital and ibm 
for software makers the move to unix means the opportunity to 
write programs applicable to many systems and computer firms 
already have begun signing distribution packages with software 
houses 
wang laboratories recently signed on to distribute software made 
by banyan systems inc of westboro which concentrates on personal 
computers analysts predict similiar alliances as companies seek to 
keep a presence in accounts that arent buying minicomputers 
some minicomputer companies are falling back on market niches 
wang labs is focusing on the storage and manipulation of document 
images prime which recently bought neighboring computervision 
corp for 435 million is focusing on computeraided design and 
manufacturing 
digital equipment too big to fit into a market niche is 
stressing its skills in creating computer networks rather than 
focusing on the computers themselves

a soybeanbased ink developed just a year ago 
is winning critical reviews at newspapers across the country and 
industry experts say it could help farmers and cut dependence on 
imported oil 
i would predict that by 1995 the majority of us newspapers 
will use it for color and if theres a petroleum crisis i think 
the switchover will be 100 percent immediately said wilson 
cunningham director of research at the reston vabased american 
newspaper publishers association 
about 500 of the nations roughly 1600 daily newspapers have 
tested or are regularly using soy ink cunningham said its a 
competitive product its not experimental anymore 
he said newspapers ranging from the boston globe to the daily 
breeze of torrance calif now use soy ink exclusively for color 
reproduction 
were pleased with it we did a lot of testing and we dont 
see ourselves going back said don oneill the globes 
production director 
were looking mainly at improving our quality said blake 
spence pressroom manager of the star tribune he said the 
minneapolis newspaper plans to start testing color soybean ink this 
month 
besides providing more vivid color and print thats less likely 
to rub off soy ink brightens the economic prospects of farmers 
its promoters say moreover biodegradable soy oil makes the ink 
easier on the environment than traditional petroleumbased ink 
they say 
when the st paul pioneer press dispatch begins everyday use of 
soybased color ink by months end it will join three minnesota 
agricultural journals that already have made the switch the 
product is now found on the pages of the farmer agri news a 
weekly farm publication of the rochester postbulletin and 
minnesota agriculture 
the inks popularity is reflected by a huge increase in soy ink 
sales 
were committed to making it a major portion of our 
business said robert brough a marketing manager at general 
printing ink in carlstedt nj the nations largest manufacturer 
of soybean ink 
the main reason is that its environmentally superior but 
besides that it prints better and looks better said brough 
whose company a division of sun chemical developed the ink in 
march 1987 using anpa research 
the companys minnesota division processed 40 percent more of 
the product in the first quarter of 1988 than it did in the final 
three quarters of 1987 said sales representative tom hayes 
its just all of a sudden taking off hayes said 
cost is the catch when it comes to a commitment to black soy 
ink color soy ink costs about the same as its petroleum 
counterpart but black soy ink costs twice as much as traditional 
ink says minnesota agriculture editor jill wheeler 
that was no big drawback to wheelers magazine which made its 
soybean debut in its april 14th edition wheeler says it costs her 
publication about 200 more a year which really isnt much when 
you consider all our readers are farmers it really does mean a 
lot 
but for a major paper printing millions of pages a day the cost 
of a complete move to soy ink remains intimidating said production 
officials at the two twin cities dailies 
tom travis pressroom manager at the st paul pioneer press 
dispatch says soybeanbased ink produced greater yield and 
brighter printed images in his papers color test runs 
we were able to use less water and use less ink to get the 
same density the samecolors travis said it looks as if it 
could be economical 
unlike traditional ink soy ink is biodegradable and therefore 
does not carry the hazardous waste classification the more common 
ink does 
though it has yet to be classified as nonhazardous soy inks 
boosters are hoping environmental officials soon will give it a 
designation that will allow its disposal through the sewer system 
hayes said 
research on soy ink began at the anpa in the mid1970s as a 
result of the oil crisis cunningham said the first ink to prove 
successful was tested in august 1987 at the cedar rapids iowa 
gazette the syracuse ny heraldjournal and the syracuse 
poststandard 
the relative cost of soy ink promises to sink even lower with 
increased sales according to hayes an estimated 25 percent of 
the us soybean crop would be consumed if all the countrys daily 
newspapers made the switch 
david bohling director of state relations for the american 
soybean association estimated some 100 million pounds of soy oil 
will be used for newspaper ink this year 
that may not be a large part of the total percentage of 
soybean oil supply said wayne bennett the associations 
president and a soybean farmer from lonoke ark but anytime you 
talk about 3 percent of a 15 billionpound supply youre talking 
about a significant customer 
the united states now produces about 75 percent of the world 
soybean crop hayes says before ink soy derivatives have long 
been used in products ranging from baby formula to cooking oils to 
vinyl floors

winning a proxy contest is no job guarantee for 
current managers 
according to an analysis of 60 proxy contests management 
resignations typically follow a proxy battle even when outsiders 
fail to win seats on a companys board of directors according to 
two researchers at the university of rochester 
professors harry and linda deangelo who studied the contests 
between 1978 and 1985 noted that about twothirds of the time top 
managers resigned within three years of a proxy fight with the 
majority of the changes coming within one year 
that includes managers who lost their jobs when disssident 
shareholders won control of their companies which happened about 
30 percent of the time 
perhaps even more significant the two found that only about 20 
percent of the companies they studied remained publicly held 
corporations run by the same management teams three years after the 
proxy contests 
harry deangelo pointed to two examples 
samuel b casey president and chief executive officer of 
pullman inc resigned in november 1978 even though dissident 
shareholders were defeated in a proxy fight two years later the 
company was acquired by wheelabratorfrye inc 
in the case of management assistance a group of dissident 
shareholders backed by asher edelman won four out of 10 board seats 
in an april 1984 proxy fight four months later the companys 
president and chief executive officer raymond kurshan resigned 
within a year the company was liquidated 
the deangelos say their findings raise serious questions about 
claims that proxy contests are an inefficient way to discipline 
managers of publicly held corporations 
in many cases of management resignations the new manager is 
designed to accommodate the dissidents interest harry deangelo 
said 
these findings suggest that independent of its immediate 
outcome a proxy challenge does pose a serious threat to managerial 
tenure the study said

the more proxy contests and the grizzlier the 
more business booms for proxy solicitors 
solicitors are responsible for the gritty legwork in a proxy 
battle they track down shareholders and talk to them draft 
letters and write newspaper ads send out mailings tally votes 
and serve as general handholders to whichever side they happen to 
represent 
theyve got it down to a science one observer remarked 
the carter organization one of the largest solicitors with 1987 
fee income of more than 22 million has had a hand in several 
major proxy fights recently 
donald carter the groups president said the cost of a proxy 
battle can range anywhere from 1 million to 10 million 
because a large precentage of any companys stock is held by 
institutional investors or in street names names other than the 
actual shareholder simply identifying just who owns the 
outstanding shares is a job for a firstrate sleuth 
at georgeson amp co the nations oldest proxy solicitor 
managing director john wilcox said he relies on a database that has 
been built up over time linking individuals and their securities 
holdings 
once shareholders are identified solicitors have to convince 
them to vote in a particular direction carter estimates his people 
talk by phone with 2 million shareholders a year in an attempt to 
influence voting 
some firms have even been known to hire actors to use southern 
accents in an attempt to sway shareholders in southern states 
observers say 
carter said new technology allowing shareholders to vote by 
phone has added a new dimension to solicitation when we get 
finished speaking with a shareholder we give them a tollfree 
number and ask them to call immediately if they agree with us he 
said 
within five minutes we know if theyre telling the truth that 
theyre going to vote with us 
if the shareholder doesnt call in with a vote carters people 
are back on the phone 
newspaper ads are also crucial to the proxy process but they 
are not directed toward the individual shareholder rather they 
are aimed at the investment community both large institutional 
investors as well as brokers who may be asked for advice from 
individual clients 
joel reed chief financial officer of desert partners lp said 
solicitors are totally key to the entire process they help 
identify and contact shareholders they give you their prognosis of 
how the vote is stacking up and they make sure proxies are properly 
executed so they dont get thrown out on a technicality 
desert partners sought seats on the board of usg corp in a 
recent proxy contest the partnership also launched a tender offer 
for usg shares 
as for the latest wave of proxy battles that has come to center 
on large corporations business is the busiest ever for 
solicitors wilcox said

iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
arrived here sunday apparently to garner support for an oil 
production cut in advance of junes meeting of the ministerial 
council of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
aqazadeh who also will visit the united arab emirates and 
indonesia said iran supported the proposal for an allround cut in 
output by oil producers from within and outside the 13nation 
international cartel 
he also told omani reporters that joint cuts could constitute 
the nucleus for strong cooperation between the two blocs 
following his talks with his omani counterpart ahmed saeed 
alshanfari the omani news agency said talks dealt with the world 
market situation and the outcome of last months oil talks in 
vienna austria in quest of stabilizing world oil prices but it 
did not elaborate 
oman last month joined five other nonopec nations in offering a 
5 percent cut in output provided opec also reduced its production 
ceiling by an equal proportion at a subsequent meeting in vienna 
opec members could not agree on the proposal and further 
discussions were deferred to the cartels semiannual meeting 
starting june 8 in vienna 
key opponents of the plan were saudi arabia and kuwait 
oman which has cooperated with opec over the past two years in 
reducing its output to help stabilize flagging oil prices has 
reversed the cuts temporarily and until the june meeting according 
to oil industry sources

upjohn co is opening a new laboratory 
in japan in order to tap the worlds secondlargest drug market and 
japans pharmaceutical research efforts the drugmaker says 
a 305000 squarefoot laboratory will be unveiled next month in 
skuba japan it initially will employ about 100 people and grow 
to about 400 by 1995 according to udo axen vice president in 
charge of research and development for upjohn in japan 
the laboratory will be the companys largest after its research 
facility in kalamazoo 
the cost of the facility has nearly doubled from estimates in 
1985 when the laboratory originally was announced to about 100 
million due to the japanese yens rise against the us dollar 
upjohn officials have cited the quality of research in japan as 
one reason for opening the skuba lab 
their japanese level of scientific sophistication is equal 
to that here or in europe said jacob stucki corporate vice 
president for pharmaceutical research we know that theres a lot 
of good stuff going on in japan and weve got to bring it back 
here 
the company already has established 10 research partnerships at 
european universities and has a small laboratory in crawly england 
one of the reasons for the big investment is that japan is 
producing new drugs as fast if not faster than we are in the united 
states said john g wagner a professor of pharmaceutics at the 
university of michigan and parttime upjohn consultant im 
impressed with the japanese scientists as well im impressed with 
their research 
they are very innovative now in what they are doing said 
charles sweeley a professor of biochemistry at michigan state 
university and also an upjohn consultant there was a time just 
after world war ii that they lagged behind in many areas of medical 
research and seemed more to follow us leads and mimic areas of 
excitement in this country 
upjohn also said it wanted to get into japan because it is the 
secondlargest drugconsuming market in the world after the united 
states officials have said that is partly because physicians there 
dispense as well as prescribe prescriptions

chinas largest oil field for many years touted 
as the model for all industrial endeavors is expected to run at a 
loss this year for the first time an official report said sunday 
the englishlanguage china daily quoted an unidentified official 
at the daqing oilfield as saying the oilfield would run a deficit 
this year of about 351 million 
daqing in chinas northeasternmost province of heilongjiang 
produces half of chinas crude oil and for the past 12 years pumped 
more than 50 million tons annually 
but rising production costs and the states low purchase price 
of crude oil now plague the oilfield for many years the model 
enterprise trumpeted in the slogan in industry learn from 
daqing 
the 27yearold oilfield employs more than 200000 workers 
production cost per ton is now 15 more than three times the 
figure a decade ago the newspaper reported 
wells that once flowed with oil now must be motor pumped 
tripling production costs it said 
output of old oil wells has been decreasing at a rate of 4 
million tons annually forcing the oilfield to drill more wells to 
maintain its production level and adding to production costs 
since 1983 daqing has obtained 1087 billion in loans from the 
world bank and the exportimport bank of japan to develop new 
oilfields in the area 
in response to rising production costs the state decided to 
raise its purchase price this year from 27 per ton to 29 but 
daqing officials said the increase would fall far short actual 
costs purchase price on the world market is 135 a ton the 
newspaper said 
daqing officials also complained about tight central government 
control that limits the oilfields crude oil consumption to 800000 
tons annually and forbids it to handle any of its own sales 
officials said even allowing daqing to handle 05 percent of its 
sales would make a difference

walmart stores inc has launched a 
program aimed at reducing the amount of imported products in the 
inventory of its discount store chain 
company officials will prepare a list of imports and all those 
items with be fair game if the company opts to go with united 
states manufacturers according to joe chappelle director of 
walmarts newlycreated usa division 
chappelle said the bentonvillebased company the nations 
thirdlargest general retailer after sears roebuck and co and k 
mart corp would ask for help from state industrial development 
organizations in enlisting domestic manufacturers for the program 
he said the company would provide the agencies with a list of 
imported products sold at its stores specifications on the 
products and other information that will help them put walmart and 
interested manufacturers in touch with each other 
chappelle said walmart founder sam walton was deeply 
committed to the buy america program and that the company was 
willing to take the risk of product specifications falling onto the 
hands of competitors 
the company has no idea how many imported products will be 
replaced by domestic ones and products will be studied on a 
caseby case basis no time frame was given for the program 
conversion of some laborintensive products may be a problem 
because of the difference in wages paid in the united states and 
some foreign countries chappelle said 
im not saying that its impossible to convert laborintensive 
items because it may be that you would wind up getting more 
value he said 
chappelle also said small manufacturers should not shy away from 
the program because of walmarts giant volume requirements 
the volume can be shocking but if a manufacturer only wants 
to bid on a certain quantity he can do that he can get any part 
of the pie he wants he said 
walmart stockholders are to discuss the program at a meeting 
next month a preview was given friday in stuttgart for 
participants in the leadar program an agricultural and rural 
leadership development program sponsored by the university of 
arkansas cooperative extension service

usg corp declared victory sunday in its proxy 
battle with desert partners lp saying a preliminary vote count 
showed a managementbacked slate of directors had defeated one 
nominated by the investor group 
but desert partners said it would continue pursuing its 22 
billion hostile buyout offer for the building materials company 
and noted it had a pending lawsuit challenging the proxy vote 
in the contest for six seats on the companys 15member board of 
directors usg said the managementbacked slate received 
approximately 57 percent of the votes cast according to a 
preliminary count released by the corporation trust co 
the final results are to be announced friday the company said 
the proxy vote conducted at the companys annual shareholders 
meeting on may 11 pitted a slate led by desert partners two main 
investors texas oilmen jack e brown and cyrus wagner jr against 
the usg slate that included three members of current management 
robert j day usg chairman and chief executive officer said 
the victory reflected stockholders confidence in the companys 
board and management he contended that 95 percent of individual 
shareholder votes were cast for the management slate 
we believe the overwhelming results of the vote is clearly a 
mandate from the shareholders not to sell usg day said 
midland texasbased desert partners indicated its slate 
received about 42 percent of the votes cast 
joel l reed desert partners chief financial officer said he 
was extremely pleased with the substantial support for the 
groups slate and called on the usg board to promptly begin merger 
negotiations 
we think these results showa large percentage of the 
stockholders support desert partners efforts to acquire usg reed 
said 
he also said he believed desert partners enjoyed more support 
among shareholders who bought usg stock after the march 15 
eligibility date for the proxy vote 
frederic spar a spokesman for desert partners said the 
investors group would press a lawsuit it filed before the 
shareholders meeting the suit challenges the proxy vote on 
grounds there were deficiencies in usgs disclosure of information 
to shareholders about a managementbacked recapitalization plan 
earlier this month usg announced a defensive recapitalization 
plan and business restructuring plan to counter desert partners 
hostile tender offer in march of 42 a share for 39 million usg 
shares or a 76 percent stake in the company the desert partners 
bid is valued at about 22 billion 
the usg plan to be submitted to a shareholders vote june 24 
would pay stockholders 37 in cash debentures with a face value of 
5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each 
of the 515 million common shares 
usg closed at 4387 a share friday on the new york stock 
exchange up 25 cents 
desert partners made a new proposal this month to acquire usg in 
a negotiated transaction in which shareholders would receive 39 
per share in cash plus debentures and stock valued at about 11 
per share spar said
