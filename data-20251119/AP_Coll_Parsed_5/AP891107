the tortured shot bodies of 
three members of a leftist party were found tuesday in western el 
salvador a party spokesman said he accused the military and 
demanded that those responsible be handed over for prosecution 
spokesman julio flores of the social christian popular movement 
said that because of recent attacks our leaders have ordered all 
party installations closed the authorities are threatening us 
they do not let us operate 
flores told the associated press in a telephone interview that 
cecilio rivera the movements coordinator in western sonsonate 
province was kidnapped on monday with two other party members 
he said their bodies showing signs of torture and 
bulletriddled were found on the outskirts of sonsonate city the 
provincial capital 40 miles west of san salvador on tuesday evening 
local judicial authorities ordered the three bodies buried as 
unidentified cadavers but party members were able to identify them 
flores said 
he said riveras age and the names and ages of the other two were 
not available immediately 
our comrades were seized by military officials dressed in 
civilian clothes after a meeting at the party hall in sonsonate 
flores said adding that they were killed in deathsquad style 
and a handprinted sign was found next to the bodies saying they had 
betrayed the fatherland 
we hold those military officials dressed in civilian clothes 
responsible and we ask that the sonsonate commander turn them over 
to judicial authorities flores said 
the commander is col juan armando rodriguez 
juan jose martel a member of the partys national executive 
told reporters we do not have the least doubt the three were 
seized by soldiers dressed in civilian clothes 
according to human rights organizations most of the more than 
70000 people killed in a 10yearold leftist guerrilla war have 
been civilians slain by rightist death squads that were especially 
active from 1979 to 1984 
deathsquad activity sharply diminished in mid1984 with the 
election of president jose napoleon duarte a centrist christian 
democrat repression of leftists started again when rightist 
president alfredo cristiani succeeded duarte on june 1 for a 
fiveyear term 
leftists have often accused cristianis republican nationalist 
alliance of being linked to the death squads made up of offduty 
military and security agents 
a bomb wrecked the headquarters of the salvadoran national 
workers federation on oct 31 killing 10 people and wounding 29 
earlier that day another bomb injured four people at comadres an 
organization of relatives of political prisoners and people who have 
disappeared in the civil war 
two of those injured in the blasts were americans 
leaders of those two leftist groups accused the military of 
mounting the bombings in retaliation for an oct 30 mortar attack by 
the farabundo marti national liberation front on the defense 
ministry compound that killed one civilian and wounded 15 
the social christian popular movement was created in 1980 by 
dissidents who broke away from duartes christian democratic party 
the san salvador home of party leader ruben zamora was bombed oct 
19 but no one was hurt 
zamora is a member of the democratic revolutionary front a 
political coalition allied to the farabundo marti guerrillas he 
long lived in exile but returned to el salvador two years ago when 
the duarte government promised an end to repression 
flores said that now the union halls offices and other 
installations were being closed because the party does not want to 
see more members killed 
to protest the attacks farabundo marti canceled its 
participation in a third meeting with cristiani government 
representatives nov 2021 in caracas venezuela to negotiate a 
ceasefire 
earlier meetings in mexico and san jose costa rica ended in 
deadlock but the two sides had agreed to continue meeting at 30day 
intervals until they could agree on some kind of a truce

david dinkins is no political meteor streaking 
suddenly across the civic firmament to seek office as the first 
black mayor of the nations most populous city 
he is a deliberate courtly man who entered politics more than 30 
years ago working his way up the ladder one rung at a time 
clubhouse worker assemblyman district leader city clerk borough 
president 
when he defeated threeterm incumbent edward i koch in 
septembers democratic primary the top of the ladder was within 
reach on tuesday he defeated republican rudolph giuliani to become 
the 106th mayor of new york 
what i do is provide hope dinkins 62 said some months ago 
hope to other blacks who want to climb up the citys power 
structure 
he is a softspoken cordial man whose diction is perfect a man 
who wears welltailored suits made in new yorks chinatown an avid 
tennis player who is said to have a very strong forehand 
born in trenton nj the son of a barber dinkins earned a 
bachelors degree in math at howard university after a tour in the 
marines he went on to brooklyn law school graduating in 1956 he 
had already married joyce burrows daughter of a harlem assemblyman 
dinkins joined a law firm but also joined the carver democratic 
club the harlem base of powerbroker j raymond jones 
jones who later became manhattans democratic chairman was 
mentor to a generation of black politicians preaching a moderate 
course and encouraging compromise with the white establishment 
in 1965 dinkins was elected to the state assembly his seat was 
eliminated by reapportionment a year later but in 1967 dinkins was 
elected a district leader from the carver club a job he would 
retain for 20 years 
in 1975 he was appointed city clerk he ran three times for 
manhattan borough president before winning the office in 1985 
though none of these jobs is allpowerful dinkins used each post 
as a platform to speak out against discrimination and to support 
organized labor he seldom took the spotlight and he rarely made 
enemies 
his one misstep was soon forgiven though it came back to haunt 
him when he ran for mayor in 1973 dinkins was named deputy mayor 
for planning but when a background check disclosed that he had 
failed to file income taxes for four years he was forced to give up 
the post 
he paid 15000 in back taxes and ascribed his actions to 
negligence 
the omission was especially surprising given dinkins legendary 
cautious nature before he announced his candidacy in february 
promising a different direction new ideas and a fresh 
perspective he formed a committee to examine whether he should 
run 
he ran as an unabashed liberal but his was not a campaign 
brimming with position papers and brash promises instead he 
focused on the need for reconciliation of the citys diverse 
population he handily defeated koch in the primary 51 percent to 
42 percent 
in the general election dinkins taxes were an issue as were 
his transfer of stock in a cable company to his son and his 
acceptance of a friends gift of a free vacation to france 
so too was his friendship with jesse jackson who is distrusted 
by many in the jewish community dinkins would not renounce jackson 
but said the former presidential candidate was not an advisor he 
reminded jewish groups that he had condemned the antisemitism of 
muslim minister louis farrakhan 
dinkins and his wife have lived in the same threebedroom 
apartment in upper manhattan for 26 years they have two grown 
children and one grandchild

young men wrestled a camel to the ground 
slit its throat and butchered it for a banquet thrown by parliament 
candidate suleiman arar in this desert town where bloody price 
riots broke out six months ago 
such rituals of rural campaigning in this sleepy town of 25000 
are partly the result of the violence that prompted king hussein to 
call the first nationwide elections in 22 years 
there were few visible reminders of aprils riots just the 
occasional scar on the street where tires were set alight during 
unrest that left 10 people dead nationwide 
the talk in maan 120 miles south of amman was about 
wednesdays elections and little else as local men met to chat with 
their friends in diwans gatherings often held beneath goats hair 
tents 
old men wearing redandwhite headdresses and younger ones in 
westernstyle suits sat under one tent on a dusty lot beside arars 
house sipping tea and smoking arabic water pipes 
among them was a local notable sheik turki sabah krayshan who 
called the elections for the 80seat parliament a new page in our 
history a new lease of life for our country 
he said arar a former interior minister who most people in maan 
call abu mohammed will listen to the people and he will present 
their requests to the parliament 
the new parliament must approve all laws and budgets and it can 
even override the kings veto it can also toss out the royally 
appointed cabinet a right spirited lawmakers exercised several 
times in the past 
but hussein remains the center of power and he has the power to 
dissolve parliament and rule without it as he has done for most of 
the past 15 years 
a young man who helped slice the camel into chunks for the 
banquet said its a special treat and well be killing a lot 
more camels after abu mohammed wins the election 
twentyeight candidates are competing for five seats in the 
sprawling maan governorate another 13 are vying for two rural 
seats reserved for southern bedouin tribes 
the april violence in maan was sparked by taxi drivers angry at 
a 25 percent increase in gasoline prices but most of the rioters 
were young men frustrated by rising prices and a lack of jobs 
at one diwan a young man told a visiting reporter that the 
government must do something about unemployment and about public 
services here which are not as good as in amman 
but older tribesmen quickly urged him to quiet down 
turki denied that there was a gap between older leaders known as 
the sheiks and a younger generation of often bettereducated 
jordanians trying to break away from tribal influence 
there are differences between the old people and the young 
he acknowledged but theyre very slight all the youth are with 
the sheiks 
but columnist mariam shahin wrote in the jordan times daily that 
the influence of the sheiks appears to be eroding in some districts 
she quoted one younger candidate as saying tribal leaders 
have had their chance look where it got them 
our rural areas have been neglected as far as educational 
economic social and cultural development projects are concerned 
so why should they be given another chance 
in maan local journalist mustafa khoshman said tribal 
allegiances would be more potent in the elections than any 
political stands by the candidates 
the maan region has the largest area but the smallest population 
of jordans governorates its 150000 people are overwhelmingly of 
bedouin stock and form the bedrock of husseins support 
the railroad that runs through maan along the islamic pilgrimage 
route to mecca was repeatedly attacked by te lawrence lawrence 
of arabia during his campaign against the turks alongside 
husseins ancestors during world war i 
the southern bedouins of the howeitat tribe were famous for 
their bravery in the battles that helped put husseins grandfather 
king abdullah on the throne 
his majesty the king is very popular here said turki who 
said hussein was welcomed like a hero when he visited maan after 
the riots 
he can come here any time there will be no problems he 
said

former uss iowa sailor kendall truitt will share a 
100000 insurance claim with the family of a crewmate whom the 
navy concluded probably caused a deadly gun turret explosion his 
attorney said monday 
gunners mate clayton hartwig had named truitt as beneficiary 
for the life insurance policy taken out about a year ago the 
connection initially focused navy investigators attention on 
truitt after the april 19 disaster that killed 47 sailors 
including hartwig 
truitt was later cleared but the navy insists that hartwig was 
the most likely cause of the explosion possibly as part of a 
suicide 
settlement of the insurance policy was initially held up by amex 
life assurance co of san rafael calif because of a dispute 
between truitt and hartwigs family the money was paid sept 13 to 
us district court in miami after truitt filed a lawsuit said 
melinda mcmullen the insurers spokeswoman 
the dispute ended with mondays agreement releasing the 
100000 said truitts attorney ellis rubin rubin refused to give 
details of the agreement 
some of the money will be paid to the hartwig family in 
recognition of the loss of their son and we are allocating an 
amount to the building of a memorial or monument to all 47 sailors 
who died rubin said 
its a very minimal sum but we are not allowed to disclose 
how much said kathleen kubicina hartwigs sister and 
spokeswoman for the family she said her father was really 
upset 
she said that truitt had told her parents they would get most of 
the money because it was such a large amount but now he seems to 
have forgotten what he said 
hartwigs family and truitt have challenged the navys 
conclusions 
kubicina said the insurance company did an investigation of 
their own and came to the conclusion there was no suicide or murder 
involved 
if the insurance company thought he had committed suicide 
they would not pay off the policy said rubin its another 
indication that the navy theory of suicide by hartwig will not hold 
water 
truitt now stationed at mayport naval station near 
jacksonville is scheduled to testify wednesday before a 
congressional committee investigating the explosion rubin said 
and would have no comment before then 
the insurance policy named truitt as the beneficiary of 
hartwigs 50000 life insurance coverage which had a 
doubleindemnity clause for accidental death truitt filed a 
lawsuit aug 14 seeking payment from amex 
hartwig died in the explosion while truitt on a lower floor 
of the gun turret survived unhurt 
the navys official report by rear adm richard milligan cleared 
truitt and cited hartwig as the most likely person to have caused 
the explosion saying he apparently placed some type of detonator 
between powder bags while loading a 16inch gun 
leaks from the navy investigation suggested that truitt and 
hartwig had a homosexual relationship that had gone sour truitt 
who is married strongly denied any sexual relationship with 
hartwig and the navy concluded there was no evidence hartwig was a 
homosexual

six western states and the province of british 
columbia on monday issued a proclamation urging their federal 
governments to take action to reduce drift net fishing in the north 
pacific 
the proclamation was announced at a news conference preceding 
the international north pacific fisheries commission meeting this 
week in seattle 
the proclamation seeks reductions in japanese highseas salmon 
fisheries to reduce the impact of squid fleets on salmon albacore 
tuna seabirds and marine mammals 
the proclamation also wants canada the united states the 
soviet union and japan to establish a new convention in the ocean 
region aimed at protecting salmon in international waters 
it would also form a research organization among the nations 
the states are alaska washington oregon idaho california and 
hawaii 
drift nets are small monofilament nets that are draggd through 
the water and catch everything they come in contact with about 800 
fishing vessels from japan korea and taiwan use the nets in the 
pacific ocean on any given day the drift net fleet can cover 
30000 miles of ocean 
the alaska department of fisheries estimates that the annual 
damage to fisheries on the high seas by drift net boats at about 
100 million including the effects on salmon albacore tuna and 
other pacific fisheries 
also monday the united states joined south pacific nations at 
the united nations in denouncing driftnet fishing as potentially 
devastating technology that massacres marine mammals sea birds 
and unwanted fish 
a us delegate ambassador jonathan moore told the general 
assemblys second committee which deals with the environment and 
other social affairs that the united states is joining the pacific 
and other nations in a resolution banning the huge drift nets 
under the general assembly resolution driftnet fishing would 
be abolished immediately in the south pacific and phased out 
worldwide by june 30 1992 
moore said the united states had no objection to developing 
nations using small drift nets that allow fish multiply and renew 
the stocks but was opposed to the vast pelagic driftnets 
the resolution is cosponsored by new zealand australia canada 
fiji mauritania papua new guinea the solomon islands vanuatu 
zaire colombia and sweden 
it does not single out any nation for criticism but expresses 
concern of the indiscriminate nature of driftnet fishing and sets 
out proposals for international management and the eventual ban of 
driftnet use

braniff inc announced monday it was 
ceasing all passenger service immediately because a severe cash 
shortage doomed its bankruptcy reorganization plan 
william g mcgee the companys chairman president and chief 
executive officer said the action was taken to preserve assets 
while braniff continues to develop alternatives which might 
include selling the airline 
we didnt come up with any other alternative financing and 
options like that there just wasnt any more cash said sandy 
smith a braniff spokeswoman in orlando where the board of 
directors met monday 
braniff halted all passenger service at midnight monday but 
will continue and expand its charter airline service while merrill 
lynch capital markets explores strategic alternatives mcgee said 
in a short statement released just before midnight 
the last flights were arriving around midnight and the planes 
would remain at their destinations indefinitely smith said 
mcgee said employees at the orlandobased braniff will be 
notified individually about their status 
persons holding braniff tickets should check with other 
airlines which may honor braniff tickets in some cases the 
statement said 
people holding tickets bought with a credit card were told to 
consult with the card company and those who purchased tickets with 
cash or a check after sept 28 were advised to call a tollfree 
number for a refund 
braniff which operated 46 of its 256 prebankruptcy flights 
friday was the first major carrier to file for bankruptcy 
following airline deregulation in the early 1980s 
it emerged as a smaller carrier in 1984 but claimed weekly 
losses of about 15 million before filing for chapter 11 
bankruptcy again on sept 28 it lost 318 million on revenue of 
293 million in the first six months of the year 
on friday braniff laid off about 100 mostly administrative 
employees it was scheduled to submit salary plans for its top 
executives in bankruptcy court nov 17 
last week scott hamilton editor of the dallasbased commercial 
aviation report said braniff needed 50 million to 100 million to 
operate on a longterm basis and could run out of cash sometime 
this month 
i think executive salaries will all be a moot point very 
shortly he said frankly im surprised braniff is still 
flying

envisioned as a key weapon in the war against drugs is plagued by 
electronics problems and cant reliably guide interceptors to 
drugsmuggling aircraft agency documents say 
next month marks one year that we have been flying the first 
p3 airborne early warning aew aircraft a customs memo said on 
may 4 adding computer errors still make air intercept control a 
difficult task 
in september the planes manufacturer lockheed aeronautical 
systems co said it would commit additional resources to 
upgrade the planes computerized tracker the equipment 
automatically plots the course and speed of other planes and its 
inaccurate readings have been largely responsible for difficulties 
in intercepting planes suspected of smuggling drugs according to 
the documents 
you cant use the system for interception and thats what all 
this magic is about said a customs source adding that the p3s 
computerized altitude course and speed readings are so inaccurate 
that radar specialists worry they could direct their interceptors 
into a collision with a drug plane the source spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
john mcginnis director of lockheeds airborne early warning 
program said in an interview the firm is making improvements in 
the tracker because of anomalous behavior that we could not 
prevent the plane is functioning but there are problems with it 
and we are correcting it 
the airplane and the tracker are very capable and doing their 
job he said adding the firm hopes to have the difficulties 
fixed by the first of the year 
other difficulties mentioned in the documents relate to the 
computer system that locates targets faulty onboard 
communications for the crew and problems with a spinning metal 
radar dome atop the plane 
difficulties aside sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said reports critical of the planes performance were ordered 
rewritten by an agency supervisor after one early test 
the p3 aews are designed to play a major role in drug 
interdiction from their customs service base in corpus christi 
texas the governments multiagency el paso intelligence center 
reports 51 percent of the 112000 kilograms of cocaine seized 
during 1988 arrived by air 45 percent in private planes 
despite the shortcomings detailed in the documents peter 
kendig acting director of customs corpus christi surveillance 
center called the aircraft a costeffective piece of equipment 
giving taxpayers one of best bangs for the buck in government 
today it works and it works great 
he said the system for tracking smugglers has a few glitches 
that can be solved 
the first p3 aew aircraft has experienced both electronic and 
mechanical difficulties since the 27 million plane arrived at the 
customs surveillance support center in corpus christi in june 1988 
according to the documents 
the documents show some of the problems afflicted a second p3 
that arrived in april at a cost of 306 million congress already 
has approved 35 million for a third p3 
the p3 orion has been used for years as a navy antisubmarine 
detection plane but the customs service plane contains specially 
designed electronics for the drug war 
identification of the authors of most of the documents was 
obscured by sources who made the material available to the 
associated press the majority of documents were written by p3 
crew members the ap was told 
the difficulties diminish one of the most important features of 
the fourengine turboprops the ability to use the multicolored 
computer displays with their impressive interchangeable graphics 
to direct customs service planes intercepting and pursuing the 
flying smugglers 
kendig said the two p3 aews were mainly responsible for 
detections leading to 36 arrests from jan 1 to aug 10 this year 
seizures included 37000 pounds of marijuana 8300 pounds of 
cocaine 17 vessels and vehicles and three aircraft he said 
john berezonsky project manager for the aew program at 
lockheed said in an interview the planes problems havent 
prevented the aircraft from doing a hell of a job and result from 
trying to put so much information on display to the operator so 
quickly we can track a greater number of targets simultaneously 
than anyone operating an aew aircraft now thats the key 
yet the documents and interviews with those knowledgeable with 
the program said the mission has been hampered in a number of ways 
planes that were possibly 300 miles away appeared as nearby 
targets single targets were displayed as multiple images targets 
were lost when the p3s onboard computer system crashed 
ships appeared at altitudes of 15000 feet 
the spinning radar dome atop the plane similar to that on an 
air force awacs stopped working when the planes speed reached 270 
knots 
agency officials accepted the first plane without the test 
flights designed by experts to create what a memo called real 
world conditions the test plan included in the documents would 
have evaluated the radar equipment over every possible terrain 
trying to see how well it detected other customs aircraft playing 
the role of drugsmuggler planes the evaluation was flown months 
after customs accepted the aircraft 
the p3s experienced numerous communications problems radar 
specialists in the back of the plane were unable to monitor pilots 
transmissions a handicap that would according to a memo 
hinder safety of flight and impede crew coordination a memo 
warned of the potential for a norad no radio situation a 
total communications failure 
two crewmen at corpus christi were ordered to water down their 
highly critical reports of the first p3s performance during a 
thentop secret mission in late julyearly august 1988 to detect 
drug planes leaving colombia one of the initial reports of the 
planes first operational test said the tracking program is so 
inaccurate the radar specialists had to develop alternate 
procedures to detect and track targets 
the aircraft tracker problem was an important part of the 
evaluation of operation barrier the mission to detect colombian 
drug planes completed in early august 1988 there are at least four 
reports two highly critical and more favorable versions of the 
originals a customs service source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said both original versions were ordered rewritten by a 
supervisor in corpus christi 
one of the originals dated aug 2 1988 said the computer 
crashed at irregular intervals and communications 
improvements were needed so the next three aircraft will not be 
communications cripples it added that deficiencies in the 
tracking program required use of antiquated raw radar to 
verify the validity of the computer displays and to provide 
accurate intercept data 
after the rewrite was ordered the same author wrote on aug 17 
1988 the operation was a complete success in which systems 
reliability was superb he concluded the potential of this 
asset is unlimited

a federal appeals court has upheld 
government rulings that the sacramento union acted improperly in 
cutting salaries by 15 percent in 1986 and firing four employees 
who criticized the newspaper in a letter to advertisers 
the two 30 rulings by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
which were made public monday were victories for the newspaper 
guild in disputes stemming from negotiations with the newspaper in 
1986 
an agreement was recently announced to sell the newspaper to a 
group headed by sacramento developers daniel benvenuti and david 
kassis 
bob saucerman one of the four employees fired over the letter 
said he expected the decisions and felt vindicated 
im very pleased i hope the employer would now swiftly 
implement the courts order and give everybody their 15 percent 
said saucerman who was a retail advertising salesman 
but sacramento union president jack bates said the newspaper 
will appeal both rulings to the us supreme court bates said 170 
to 180 employees were affected 
we believe very strongly that we were at impasse in contract 
negotiations and had the right to implement the pay cut bates 
said we also believe very strongly that we had the right to fire 
those four people on the basis of their actions 
the guild representing editorial circulation business 
advertising and maintenance employees negotiated with the 
newspaper in 1986 on a contract to replace the one that was to 
expire that may 
the talks continued beyond may but in early august 1986 the 
newspaper declared an impasse and put its last offer into effect 
including an acrosstheboard 15 percent pay cut and elimination of 
a longstanding provision requiring all employees to join the guild 
the union denied that negotiations were at an impasse as 
required for an employer to implement its final contract offer a 
hearing officer ruled in the newspapers favor but was overruled by 
the national labor relations board whose decision was upheld by 
the appeals court 
the court said there was evidence to support the nlrbs 
conclusion that no real bargaining had taken place on the key issue 
of union security when the talks were suspended 
when the security issue was raised the company put the matter 
off to a later time and then declared an impasse before any real 
discussion took place the court said it rejected the 
newspapers argument that the guild had refused to discuss the 
issue 
the court upheld the nlrbs order requiring the newspaper to 
reinstate the former contract which included the higher pay level 
and the union membership requirement 
the unsigned ruling was issued by judges otto skopil betty 
fletcher and ferdinand fernandez 
the other ruling involved a letter written by four members of 
the guilds negotiating committee to 50 of the newspapers 
advertisers in october 1987 
the letter described the employees efforts to get a contract 
mentioned the pay cut and declared that the paper was speeding 
downhill with circulation plummeting and good staffers leaving 
the advertisers were urged to contact executives of the newspaper 
the court said the four employees bob saucerman ana sandoval 
georgia canfield and sue harper were fired two weeks later bates 
accused them of disloyalty and said the letter contained falsehoods 
that disrupted the newspapers relationship with advertisers the 
court said 
in an opinion by fletcher the court upheld the nlrbs decision 
that the letter was within the employees rights of collective 
bargaining and was not an improper act of disloyalty

tired of scrounging under the car 
seat for change to drop in the parking meter this city is 
considering introducing the latest in convenience for the motorist 
on the go the personal parking meter 
if the city commission goes along with the proposal today 
drivers would be offered pocket computersized devices that 
automatically keep track of parking time in metered zones the 
parkulators would sell for 50 and be dumped in the trash when 
50 worth of curb time is used up 
its your own personal parking meter said tom mccormick 
city parking manager we get complaints constantly if i only 
had enough change on me or had some way to prepay the meter i 
wouldnt have gotten this ticket now they wont have that 
excuse 
motorists would be responsible for turning the units on and 
punching in the maximum time allowed at whatever meter theyve 
pulled up to if they dont or if they fail to come back and punch 
in another deposit when the times up mccormick said theyll get 
tickets just like an oldfashioned meter scofflaw

ray johnson an exconvict sterlized by the 
state of california as a teenager who turned his life around and 
became a prominent anticrime consultant has died he was 62 
johnson died sunday night at a san diego hospital he had 
undergone serveral surgical procedures and was in ill health for 
the past year said a longtime friend district attorneys 
spokesman steve casey 
johnsons life was the basis for a television movie 
in and out of california juvenile institutions from the age of 
7 johnson was sterlized at age 17 under a theory that juvenile 
delinquency could be eradicted by ensuring that teenage offenders 
didnt have children 
the syracuse ny native moved to san diego at age 1 he 
served time in juvenile and adult institutions for auto theft 
burglary and escape but most of his criminal career involved armed 
robbery 
while doing time at folsom prison for armed robbery johnson and 
two other inmates became the first maxiumumsecurity prisoners to 
escape from the northern california facility in 1958 the three 
were recaptured 
johnson spent the next four years in solitary confinement 
casey a former san diego newspaper reporter who met johnson while 
covering jails and prisons said johnson never liked small places 
after that 
he once had an apartment and it drove him nuts casey 
recalled 
johnson who used to claim the late san diego mafia chief tony 
mirable as his godfather turned his life around after his parole 
in 1968 
he returned to san diego and worked for the old county 
department of honor camps then as a research associate for western 
behavioral sciences institute in la jolla 
johnson who lived in del mar also became an internationally 
known anticrime lecturer who spoke frequently to business and 
civic groups among the lawenforcement organizations he addressed 
were the international association of chiefs of police and the 
royal canadian mounted police 
in 1978 gov edmund g jerry brown jr granted johnson a 
full pardon 
johnson made about three dozen appearances as a guest on the 
tonight show and regarded host johnny carson as a good friend 
and a major influence casey said 
johnson was honored by mayors pete wilson and maureen oconnor 
who declared days in his honor in 1978 and 1988 respectively 
when he died johnson was working on a robbery and 
violenceprevention program for small businesses and a similar 
program to help the elderly 
if we need proof that its possible for a person to change 
ray was that proof i wouldnt have liked the old ray johnson 
said casey 
johnson cowrote a 1975 autobiography too dangerous to be at 
large which was a reference to one of superior court judge john 
hewickers comments to johnson when he was sentenced to prison for 
the last time 
the book was the basis for a television movie dangerous 
company in which johnsons role was played by beau bridges 
johnson also had a bit part in the network movie playing a prison 
guard 
johnson is survived by his wife joanna and his mother doris 
tarry

no one really knows what happened to 
richard sproules two weeks ago he was a wellrespected police 
chief in this tough shoemakers town that gave the world rocky 
marciano and championship football teams 
then on oct 24 sproules was arrested for allegedly taking 
cocaine from the police departments evidence room to support his 
fiveyear addiction 
at his arraignment prosecutors said sproules confessed he was a 
cocaine addict the 22year police veteran who once headed the 
departments antidrug unit also is being investigated in 
connection with hundreds of thousands of dollars missing from 
operating funds and money from seized drug deals court documents 
show 
the news has taken peoples breath away 
sproules 45 was a light for this bluecollar citys 93000 
residents some 20 miles south of boston with drugrelated crime a 
daily reality and racial tension a constant presence they looked 
to him often 
nan ellison the naacps local president met sproules more than 
10 years ago after racial graffiti was scrawled over a neighborhood 
church 
he was very sensitive to peoples needs all kinds of 
peoples needs she said he made you feel like a friend and 
his door was always open 
that open door and the way sproules refused to concede defeat 
without a battle may have been his undoing friends and colleagues 
said 
between heading a 185member police force setting up 
neighborhood crime watch patrols acting as a liaison on various 
community boards guiding high school counselors coaching preteen 
soccer his plate was full 
when he got home to his wife and two kids at night it was after 
hours of doling out advice and hearing peoples problems 
he was called upon so much maybe it was too much ellison 
said he might have been under stress and we didnt know it he 
never showed it 
everyone agrees sproules never let on that anything was 
bothering him 
since the news broke officers down at the department have been 
dazed at the bar people drain beers while discussing sproules 
alleged secret life and speculating on his fall from grace 
the overriding thing was the intensity of their reaction 
said steve albert a talk show host at wbet radio who threw open 
his mike the evening the sproules story broke 
in a lot of cases we were knocking people off their chairs 
with this it was the last thing anybody expected to hear they 
needed to talk and let off some steam 
perhaps what people find most disconcerting is the fact that 
sproules an authority figure could succumb to an everyday human 
frailty if it can happen to him it can happen to anyone 
people said again and again 
eugene franciosi a junior high school principal is still 
trying to figure out how the police chief a friend and adviser to 
whom many students turned could have sunk into the very hell he 
was trying to eradicate 
its been like a car accident or some other kind of tragedy 
he said its easy to say thats terrible but its not going to 
happen to someone we know he said now we know that 
assumptions just not true 
cocaine like many drugs can be extremely addictive and 
sproules work drew him daily into temptations way until 
eventually coworkers suspected him and an internal investigation 
was launched 
sproules was suspended with pay and subsequently resigned he 
was freed on his own recognizance after pleading innocent to the 
drug charges he talked only briefly following his arrest 
i was always helping other people he said but i never 
found time for myself maybe that was my problem 
authorities have convened an investigative grand jury to examine 
evidence against sproules who last week admitted himself to a 
fourweek drug rehabilitation program was not available for 
comment his attorney bruce edmands did not return telephone 
messages left at his office 
if convicted sproules could face more than 20 years in prison 
edward stern a local carpenter and friend who spoke recently 
with sproules said the chief in some ways has been set free 
the man feels like theres a 3000pound weight off his soul 
that finally he doesnt have to lie anymore stern said

congress is giving federal agencies an open 
money sack to hire private consultants and contractors and the 
energy department even lets them perform sensitive work on nuclear 
technology a senate report says 
the department of energy relies on private consultants to 
perform virtually all basic governmental functions according to 
a report released monday by sen david pryor dark chairman of a 
senate subcommittee 
the number of energy department employees has declined from 
20000 in 1980 to 16000 the report said adding that contractors 
have in effect become part of its permanent work force 
it relies on contractors in the preparation of its most 
important plans and policies the development of budgets and budget 
documents and the drafting of reports to congress and 
congressional testimony the report said 
it relies on contractors to monitor arms control negotiations 
help prepare decisions on the export of nuclear technology and 
conduct hearings and initial appeals in challenges to security 
clearance disputes it said 
pryor said the department was unable to say how many contractors 
and consultants it has or how much it is spending on them but he 
said the department pays more for work by consultants than it would 
for the same work by employees 
we spend in the congress weeks debating whether government 
employees should get a 2 percent or a 36 percent pay raise but we 
provide literally an open money sack to agencies to hire private 
contractors pryor said 
donna r fitzpatrick assistant energy secretary for management 
and administration defended the use of consultants and contractors 
as necessary to provide technical expertise that the government 
cannot obtain from its own employees 
she said the departments employees are stretched very thin 
and that government salaries are too low to keep employees who can 
be hired at higher salaries by the contractors but she said the 
department uses only its own employees to make policy decisions 
fitzpatrick acknowledged the panels finding that remarks by 
energy secretary james watkins to a house panel in april on nuclear 
facilities had been written by a private defense contractor bdm 
but she said that was an isolated incident 
the report was written by the staff of pryors senate 
governmental affairs subcommittee on federal services post office 
and civil service which has been looking into use of consultants 
by the energy department and other agencies 
pryor said many of the consultants and contractors also do 
business with private energy companies or foreign governments and 
companies 
the potential for a conflict of interest is unchecked he 
said 
david oconnor director of procurement and contract management 
for the environmental protection agency defended epas use of 
outside contractors in testimony before the panel he said epas 
budget for contracts tripled during the 1980s

the confusing task of choosing a home equity 
loan should be easier starting today under new federal rules 
requiring lenders to disclose in advance the interest rate fees 
and other terms theyre offering 
federal reserve regulations voluntary since june 7 became 
mandatory today in addition to advance disclosure the law curbs 
misleading advertising and other abusive practices 
simple easily understood and easily comparable information 
will be available to consumers to intelligently shop around for a 
home equity loan said rep david price dnc chief sponsor of 
the legislation passed late last year that directed the fed to 
write the rules 
lenders now must disclose basic cost information when borrowers 
make an initial inquiry and again when the loan application is 
filed 
another provision targets deeply discounted teaser rates 
that offer borrowers a break on their first few payments before the 
rates rise sharply lenders can still advertise teaser rates but 
they must give equal prominence to the interest rate borrowers will 
be paying after the discount expires 
the rules forbid contract clauses permitting lenders to call in 
the loan accelerate payments or raise the interest rate at whim 
adjustablerate home equity loans now must be based on an index 
outside the lenders control such as the prime rate published in 
newspapers not the lenders own prime rate 
consumer advocates were pleased with the law sponsored in the 
senate by christopher dodd dconn but they complained that the 
federal reserve regulations do not fully live up to their spirit 
consumers union a national organization that publishes 
consumer reports magazine filed suit last week in us district 
court in washington seeking to close what it considers several 
loopholes 
the group opposes a provision in the law that requires lenders 
in the first preapplication disclosure to reveal only the index on 
which a floating interest rate is based but not the margin or 
difference between the rate charged and the index 
we think the margin is an integral part of the cost that 
consumers need to know we also think the legislation expressly 
requires lenders to disclose the margin said attorney michelle 
meier of consumers union 
bankers are generally satisfied with the law recognizing it was 
needed to curb at least isolated abuses but according to diane 
casey regulatory affairs director of the independent bankers 
association of america the disclosures may swamp borrowers with 
too much detail one provision for instance requires the lender 
to provide a chart showing how the interest rate and minimum 
monthly payment would have varied over the past 15 years 
it gets confusing casey said people dont care what 
happened 15 years ago they want to know whats happening today and 
what their payment is going to be tomorrow 
the popularity of home equity loans has surged since the 1986 
tax law began phasing out the deductibility of consumer loans home 
loans however are still fully deductible including home equity 
loans in most instances this year only 20 percent of nonmortgage 
interest is deductible in 1990 only 10 percent is eligible and 
beginning in 1991 none will be 
the federal reserve said outstanding revolving home equity loans 
totaled 263 billion at midoctober up from 21 billion a year 
earlier and 117 billion in june 1987 when the agency first began 
keeping track 
according to a survey of 138 lenders by the consumer bankers 
association the delinquency and foreclosure rates for home equity 
loans were lower this year than for regular first mortgages 
but consumer advocates have always been leery of home equity 
loans and say they havent been tested during an economic downturn 
defaults could soar in a recession they contend 
the better business bureau says home equity loans should be used 
only for major expenditures such as college education home 
improvement or for major medical expenses not for luxuries such as 
sports cars

the chairmen of two senate committees that 
oversee natural resources issues are urging their colleagues to 
reject james cason as assistant secretary of agriculture 
sen bennett johnston dla who is chairman of the senate 
energy and natural resources committee and sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the agriculture committee are sending a letter 
to all senators saying cason is neither qualified nor suitable 
for the job 
cason 35 has been nominated to head the agriculture 
departments forest and conservation programs 
he has drawn fire for his record as a highranking official 
during the reagan administration at the interior department where 
critics contend he put private development interests ahead of 
environmental concerns 
a review of mr casons education and employment history 
indicates that he came to the department of the interior with 
little if any by the way of background or qualifications for the 
job said the letter dated nov 3 
moreover mr casons record indicates a reluctance to rely on 
the professional expertise available to him at the department of 
the interior it says 
leahy opposed cason during committee hearings saying he 
repeatedly shrugged aside public interests in decisions on how to 
use public lands 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who is widely admired on 
capitol hill has sought to assure senators that he sets 
environmental policy at the department and cason would be taking 
orders from him 
but johnston and leahy cited testimony critical of cason from 
max peterson who retired recently as chief of the forest service 
after 38 years with the agency and currently holds the title chief 
emeritus 
in my judgment he cason clearly is not qualified the 
senators quote peterson as saying 
the opposition to mr casons nomination is broad and deep

it took martin miller seven years but hes 
finally convinced the cia and the state department to change their 
maps of israel and jordan to reflect historical fact and us 
policy 
its a story about a persistent advocate a cumbersome 
bureaucracy and the intractable israeliarab conflict 
miller a retired treasury department official began his 
crusade in 1981 when he noticed that a governmentpublished map 
book showed the west bank of the jordan river as part of jordan 
this was despite the fact that the united states and most of the 
rest of the world have never recognized jordans 1950 annexation of 
the 2200squaremile territory 
on the official us maps published by the central intelligence 
agency the israelijordanian border was drawn along the 1949 
armistice line which defined israels physical borders until the 
1967 war the maps did not reflect israels capture of the west 
bank in that war and the new ceasefire lines created as a result 
it wasnt right it just didnt reflect reality said miller 
he undertook his campaign in a methodical way buying a computer 
and poring over history books and archive documents far from the 
controversy generated by every wrinkle of the arabisraeli dispute 
the first step was a letter to thensecretary of state alexander 
haig the retired general referred millers letter to a 
littleknown state department entity called the office of the 
geographer 
the office maps official us policy on sovereignty issues for 
internal state department publications and acts as an advisory and 
arbitration board for other government agencies that issue maps 
miller began corresponding with the geographer who issued a 
directive in 1982 ordering cartographers to stop showing the west 
bank as anyones territory 
but still the public maps were not changed 
miller also enlisted his congressmans help wrote opinion 
pieces and editorial letters but the maps were still wrong 
finally miller asked to see haigs successor at the state 
department george shultz whom he had known when shultz was 
treasury secretary that was very exciting miller said he 
left shultz with 92 documents buttressing his argument 
more conversations with administration officials and letters 
followed 
in 1984 miller read an opinion piece in the washington post by 
former deputy cia chief robert gates who said the agency was 
emphasizing accuracy and objectivity in its assessments 
miller decided to call gates talking his way past skeptical 
aides and secretaries until he got through 
i told him his people were not adhering to his standards 
miller said two days later on jan 2 1985 he was summoned to a 
meeting with two cia officials 
they promised the maps would be changed but a year later 
nothing had been done miller said 
miller called again and this time a promise was fulfilled the 
map of jordan was changed in 1986 it took until january 1989 to 
change the israel map 
the new maps show the 1967 ceasefire line between israel and 
jordan with the west bank designated as two cultural regions 
judea and samaria the two biblical names are also used by israeli 
nationalists to describe the region 
millers efforts also bore fruit outside government circles when 
the encyclopedia britannica changed its maps he said 
the state department is reluctant to give all the credit to 
miller for the changes but concedes his campaign influenced the 
decision he was very very active and believed in his cause 
said one official familiar with the case 
perhaps the best tribute to millers determination was contained 
in a letter from shultz earlier this year soon after the israel 
maps were changed 
dear marty wrote the man who labored in vain for six years 
to bring about israeliarab peace talks im glad you kept at it 
and accomplished something that is of genuine and lasting 
significance

percent

the dollar later in the day as it came under selling pressure from 
security houses and life insurance companies said kaneo ogino a

putting downward pressure on the dollar ogino said

a man prosecutors say is a major 
heroin trafficker testified he paid another accused drug dealer in 
a plot to assassinate pakistans former leader who died in a 
mysterious plane crash 
federal prosecutors allege that mushtaq malik a 41yearold 
pakistani on trial on charges of conspiracy and importation of 
heroin arranged for samir n houchaimi of amman jordan to bring 
10 million in heroin to the united states for resale 
houchaimi was arrested in springfield with heroin nearly two 
years ago authorities said 
prosecutors say malik is known as the black prince and they 
allege he is one of the worlds biggest heroin traffickers 
malik testified monday in us district court that he had hired 
houchaimi to kill pakistani president gen mohammed zia ulhaq 
malik did not make clear whether the assassination plot he said he 
was involved in had anything to do with the crash 
malik a selfdescribed pakistani prince said houchaimi was a 
former colonel in the jordanian army 
i dont know anything about money for heroin in america 
malik said 
malik was summoned to testify by his attorney stephen ferrarone 
he was scheduled for crossexamination today by assistant us 
attorney kevin oregan 
malik testified he advanced houchaimi 1 million on behalf of 
superiors in the leftleaning pakistan peoples party whose 
current leader is prime minister benazir bhutto to secure 
personnel and equipment for the assasination 
the 51yearold houchaimi testified last week that he had been 
given 2 kilograms of heroin in nicosia cyprus to sell in the 
united states for malik houchaimi was arrested with a nylon 
handbag filled with the heroin on feb 6 1988 near a downtown bus 
terminal authorities said 
six months later on aug 17 1988 zia died in a plane crash 
that also killed 29 other people including us ambassador arnold 
raphel 
after houchaimi was arrested he arranged a meeting in rio de 
janiero brazil between malik and a mr costa the alias for 
undercover us drug agent william j powers according to the 
springfield unionnews 
malik and the agent met in march 1988 supposedly to fly to 
costa rica together but malik was arrested and returned to the 
united states where he has been held in custody the newspaper 
reported 
malik said he had lost face among his compatriots because he 
recommended a man who failed to carry out his task in the plot 
i dont know anything about money for heroin in america 
malik testified i wanted to have that money back for my people 
and save my face

rep james traficant says part of an insurance 
investigators report on illfated pan am flight 103 shows the 
united states was warned an hour before takeoff about a possible 
bomb 
the plane blew up last december over lockerbie scotland 
killing 259 people on the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground the 
airline has been sued for more than 300 million 
traficant dohio said he has a report indicating the cia got a 
warning from west german intelligence about a suspicious suitcase 
on the plane 
the cia termed the report nonsense and administration 
officials said the united states was not warned about a flight 103 
bomb by any foreign intelligence agency 
on monday traficant passed out five pages from what he said was 
a 27page report prepared for pan ams insurance company 
the document says a west german agent watching baggage handlers 
singled out one suspicious suitcase and reported something was 
very wrong 
west german intelligence passed on the concern to a cia unit in 
frankfurt which relayed it to an unidentified control says 
the excerpt 
control replied dont worry about it dont stop it let it 
go the excerpt says 
a former cia employee victor marchetti joined traficant at the 
capitol hill news conference to identify himself as the person who 
gave the congressman the document marchetti said he was not 
involved in writing the report but believes it is essentially 
accurate 
i know the intelligence officers who prepared this report 
said marchetti who retired from the agency in 1969 and wrote a 
book critical of the cia 
cia spokesman mark mansfield who last week called the report 
nonsense said monday its still nonsense 
my gut instinct is the cia is very defensive and that they 
know a hell of a lot more than theyre telling us said 
traficant i think that there are questions that now have to be 
answered 
traficant said the full report shows connections between the 
bombing drugrunning and hostage rescue efforts 
pan am already has subpoenaed documents relating to one of the 
people mentioned prominently in the report monzer alkassar who 
is characterized as having connections with both the terrorist 
bombers and the cia

former secretary of state george shultz is 
being lampooned by the white house for suggesting that cocaine and 
other drugs should be legalized 
whoa hes been out on the west coast too long hasnt he 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said monday the guy 
slips into retirement and right away he starts saying things that 
are strange 
more seriously fitzwater said clearly we do not believe 
drugs should be legalized president bush feels very strongly that 
that is the wrong direction at the wrong time that it is not a 
moral position for the united states to take and that it makes no 
sense whatsoever 
shultz said legalizing drugs is something that everyone is 
scared to talk about no politician wants to say it 
his views were published in the wall street journal oct 27 in 
an adaptation of remarks he made to an alumni gathering at the 
stanford business school in palo alto calif on oct 7 
he said that attacking drugs with a criminal justice approach 
is not likely to work 
shultz said it seems to me were not really going to get 
anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business 
and the incentives for criminality out of it 
frankly he added the only way i can think of to 
accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at 
some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost 
when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives 
including the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around 
and get kids addicted so that they create a market for themselves 
they wont have that incentive because they wont have that market 
we need at least to consider and examine forms of 
controlled legalization of drugs shultz said 
shultz served as secretary of state for president reagan from 
july 1982 until january 1989 when he returned to the faculty at 
the stanford business school 
during the nixon administration he was budget director and 
secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the customs 
service

action by the supreme court clears the way for 
the start of payments from a 25 billion settlement fund to women 
injured by the dalkon shield birth control device 
the device marketed in the early 1970s allegedly caused 
infertility spontaneous abortions pelvic inflammation and even 
in some cases death 
here at a glance are the details 
a target date for payments for those with active claims is late 
february but lawyers say the payments may not begin until the 
spring 
nearly 100000 of the more than 300000 women who filed claims 
against ah robins the richmond va manufacturer of the device 
still have active claims and stand to share in the settlement 
baltimore lawyer michael pretl however says thousands of 
women with active claims may collect very little because of 
problems in their cases for example they may have used more than 
one brand of intrauterine device 
some 9000 cases were settled before ah robins declared 
bankruptcy and announced a reorganization plan in 1985 payments 
made under those settlements are serving as a model for awards in 
this settlement pretl predicts that women who suffered serious 
injuries may collect between 25000 and 250000 
a fourmember trust fund committee appointed by us 
district judge robert merhige in richmond will make the awards the 
committee is led by georgine vairo of the fordham university law 
school in new york 
women who win awards most often will have to pay their lawyers 
onethird of the amounts 
women already in the case need do nothing right now but women 
who believe they were injured by using a dalkon shield are urged to 
seek legal help those women if their claims are proved could 
share in a supplemental trust fund established by ah robins 
insurer aetna casualty and surety co

jamaican prime minister michael manley admits 
his dream of a united nations strike force to combat drug cartel 
terrorism lacks necessary political support but he says he will 
keep up his crusade for the idea 
manley told the senate judiciary committee on monday that a 
western hemisphere training center for agents and intelligence 
could serve as an alternative but only an international strike 
force would really do the job 
it isnt a regional problem its an international problem 
manley said in pitching for an eightpoint program aimed at 
fighting the narcotics scourge 
he said the organization of american states or some other 
international group might be interested in sponsoring such a 
project 
manley was preaching his gospel to a friendly audience 
committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel is a leading 
congressional supporter of the concept of a multinational force to 
combat the drug cartels 
the strike force plan could turn the rhetoric about 
apprehending drug kingpins into a reality and yet to my amazement 
we have not had a firm recommendation by the administration on this 
plan biden said 
manley said quite a few governments have been skeptical about 
the idea of allowing foreign troops on their soil even if by 
invitation and under un auspices as called for under his plan 
after the hearing he met for 20 minutes with vice president dan 
quayle to discuss the drug problem before leaving for that session 
he told reporters it would be too ambitious to expect bush 
administration support for the idea of a multinational force 
manley likened the strike force to paramilitary forces 
established a decade ago to fight aircraft hijackers and urban 
guerrillas in west germany and italy the unit manley said would 
be used where drug lords create a terror in society and try to 
break its will to fight them 
he said it might be possible to get action soon on the seven 
other points in his antidrug program 
the package includes a central intelligencegathering system a 
school for narcotics agents and an international reserve pool of 
narcotics agents and intelligence operatives 
manley said the seven other pieces of the package were actually 
more important if taken in total than the proposed paramilitary 
force although the idea of such an elite unit has drawn most of 
the spotlight

the 1980s are a lost decade for latin america 
with a drop of individual incomes that threatens the establishment 
of democracy according to brazilian president joao baena soares 
who heads the organization of american states 
he also saw damage to the united states and other industrial 
countries 
various sources estimated that the drop in imports by latin 
america cost the united states more than 900000 jobs between 1980 
and 1987 including both the jobs that disappeared and those which 
could have been created if latin america and the caribbean had not 
had to curb their imports he said 
the organizations general assembly meets in washington for a 
week beginning monday with 32 governments represented brazil will 
have its first popular election for president in 29 years on nov 
15 
for many groups of people the reduction of income and the 
lack of jobs have been added to previous frustrations so that 
there is a serious lack of basic necessities he told the 
executive committee that was preparing the washington session 
this situation is certainly a threat to the stability of the 
democracies that are in the process of consolidating themselves 
he said that in 1988 in the worst crisis since the 1930s 
average income was down 16 percent bringing it to the level of 
1978 all except five countries saw incomes decline and in nine 
countries the level was down to that of 20 years before 
in venezuela the average income was calculated at 4543 last 
year the same as in 1964 
soares noted there had been serious disturbances this year 
because of the economic situation he did not name countries but 
was clearly referring to last februarys riots in venezuela in 
which hundreds of people were killed and the agitation in 
argentina that brought the resignation of president raul alfonsin 
before the end of his term 
the committee calculated the outflow of cash as totalling 204 
billion since 1980 peaking at 35 billion in 1985 then declining 
for two years but rising again to 315 billion in 1988 
it laid the blame on a marked reduction in the flow of capital 
from abroad the high level of latin american payments on foreign 
debt and the flight of capital from latin america to safe 
havens abroad 
it quoted figures to show argentina for example spent 20 
percent of its budget on education in 1972 but only 6 percent in 
1986 mexico spent 51 percent on health in 1972 and only 14 
percent in 1986 
the lack of government spending on things like education and 
health have disproportionately severe effect on the lowest income 
groups in the member states the report said 
the poor do not have the means for private health care and 
education when public services are no longer available

one hundred more weekly passenger flights to 
japan are expected under a new agreement officials say will only 
begin to meet the huge demand in the nations most lucrative 
aviation market 
a onethird increase in flights both ways and a similar boost in 
cargo service between the two countries will begin after most of 
the agreement takes effect next october transportation department 
officials said monday 
the department will decide which airlines and cities are to get 
the increased flights 
the formal pact being completed this week after an agreement 
in principle was signed in tokyo sunday will open the way for 
other airlines to apply for flights to japan and for up to six 
additional us cities to be served by flights to tokyo and other 
japanese cities 
it also encourages more flights to land in alaska and adds new 
flights between japan and guam and saipan 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said it was the most 
significant aviation agreement between the two countries in 37 
years he said it would boost travel trade and tourism across the 
pacific ocean 
agreement came after four years of talks and six days of intense 
negotiations involving us state commerce interior and 
transportation department officials 
neither side got as many flights as it wanted said jeffrey n 
shane transportation assistant secretary for policy and 
international affairs 
thats good because it means both sides remain hungry shane 
said adding this would increasing chances that even more flights 
can be added in the future 
shane said the japanus route generates about 6 billion in 
revenue for us carriers with the number of passengers increased 
20 percent a year and cargo 30 percent a year over the past two 
years 
he said passenger flights between japan and the united states 
are usually full 
we have a desperate need for more capacity shane said 
this allows us to respond far more effectively to the immediate 
demands for service in this market 
six us and three japanese airlines currently fly between japan 
and honolulu los angeles san francisco portland seattle 
minneapolis detroit dallas chicago new york or washington dc 
shane declined to say what us cities might be added or what 
airlines might apply for the new routes but said competition would 
be keen he said the departments policy is to increase airline 
competition and this could be a factor in deciding which carriers 
will be approved 
the pact gives us airlines three new passenger and cargo 
routes to tokyo three to other japanese cities and an additional 
allcargo service both federal express and northwest now fly cargo 
planes to and from japan 
reciprocal routes would be awarded to japanese airlines 
allowing some routes to extend beyond one us city the agreement 
still will not allow japanese airlines to carry passengers from one 
us city to another 
charter cargo and passengers flights by us carriers will be 
increased from 300 to 450 a year and japanese shippers will also 
be able to increase flights beginning jan 1 
us airlines have more usjapan flights than japanese 
airlines and the balance will remain in favor of the united 
states shane said 
the agreement would increase weekly us flights carrying both 
passengers and cargo from 151 to 200 japanese flights from 95 to 
146 cargo flights would increase from 39 a week for us carriers 
to 53 and from 27 for japanese cargo haulers to 37 the figures 
include only westbound flights with nearly all flying the other 
way as well 
alaska will be added as a possible stop for all us and 
japanese airlines flying between the two countries the states 
economy has suffered from a decrease in air service as more flights 
bypass it in order to preserve other landing rights

hunks or pairing up with unlikely male love interests but they 
wont find any strong female role models among 26 new network shows 
this year a womens group says 
nor will they find any breakthroughs in portraying minorities or 
find more women behind the cameras the national commission on 
working women of wider opportunities for women said monday 
unlike years past no strong female leads emerge no workplace 
dramas or comedies either break new ground or provide compelling 
role models the group said after surveying the 26 new 1989 
primetime tv shows at best the status quo prevailed at worst 
backward steps were taken 
malefemale relationships on cbs major dad and abcs 
chicken soup are straining viewer credibility the group 
said 
major dad involves a crusty marine and his forgiving young 
wife while chicken soup stars comic jackie mason in a 
catholicjewish matchup that resorts to flat stereotypes and 
unbelievable characters the group said 
nbcs baywatch shows scantily clad female lifeguards or 
women sunning in bikinis or scampering on the beach the group 
said 
one episode of doogie howser md an abc show about a 
16yearold doctor has a brilliant female radiologist asking 
doogie to father her child 
on fox broadcastings open house a professional and 
competent female doctor while conducting physicals for employees 
of a real estate firm spots an old flame among the employees and 
begins to swoon and speaks to him in a seductive voice 
the group said the shows are filled with stereotypes double 
entendres and outdated characters 
as for minorities as in the past most minority characters on 
new shows are black and most of them appear in all or mostly 
black shows 
behind the scenes 27 of the 145 producers on the 26 shows are 
women ten of the shows have no females behind the cameras the 
group said 
at best the new season has given us the status quo at worst 
television has taken a step backward from the progress it made last 
year actress linda lavin said in remarks prepared for delivery 
wednesday at the groups 11th annual women at work broadcast awards 
program 
the only new shows that got good marks were life goes on and 
alien nation 
abcs life goes on starring christopher burke as a 
teenager with downs syndrome was cited for its credible 
exploration of family issues 
alien nation a fox broadcasting co show about aliens 
living on earth was praised for being in many ways an allegory 
about racism

delany for her portrayal of an army nurse on abcs vietnam war 
drama china beach

the judge released chaikin and gitelson on personal 
recognizance despite a request from assistant us attorney 
william s block for a 250000 bond on each 
the indictments are part of an investigation of fraud in the 
sale of rental properties involving hudinsured mortgages in the 
washington area that has seen 36 convictions so far 
as described by an unidentified source close to the case 
quoted in todays editions of the washington post gitelson would 
locate a property to purchase and chaikin would find a straw buyer 
or someone only pretending to be the buyer and getting a fee for 
the role 
the two would bribe a government appraiser to assign a value to 
the property more than it was worth and the straw buyer would 
apply for a loan insured by a hud agency using the inflated 
appraisal 
gitelson then paid the straw buyer a fee the source told the 
newspaper chaikin would then pay the seller the actual market 
value using the loan funds to do so and pocketing the leftover 
loan funds 
the property was then resold at the inflated value and those 
profits were also pocketed the newspaper said

displaying their best diplomatic manners the 
united states and japan are urging each other to make farreaching 
changes in how they operate their economies 
the united states on the receiving end monday of a long list of 
japanese complaints was taking the offensive today the windup of 
a twoday round of new talks on lifestyle and other nontrade 
problems linked to the us trade deficit with japan 
us officials planned to urge the japanese to take such steps 
as consuming more building more sewers ports and 
superexpress highways and making it easier to convert 
farmland into housing projects 
this was in addition to betterknown us complaints about 
antiquated distribution noncompetitive pricing and corporate 
collusion that the united states contends discriminates against 
imports and penalizes japanese consumers the american side was 
also stressing that it wants to keep the us investment market 
open to all countries but obstacles to investing in japan make this 
increasingly difficult to defend 
the japanese led off with their grievances monday because they 
accorded that courtesy to the americans when the talks started two 
months ago in tokyo and now they were the guests said senior us 
officials who briefed reporters monday on condition of anonymity 
despite strong complaints and obvious disagreement mondays 
talk at the state department was constructive and open one of 
the us sources said 
the new talks were announced by president bush last may as an 
effort to pinpoint nontrade causes contributing to the annual 50 
billion us trade deficit with japan the two countries have 
agreed to meet every two months with a final report in mid1990 
a us official said monday the ideal outcome would be emergence 
of some new patterns of behavior in both our countries so that 
the us is much more competitive and so that on the japanese 
side their economy is much more open 
the japanese charged monday that us corporate behavior 
weakened the us economy and its competitiveness both sides said 
japan pointed to wall streets leveraged buyouts as an example of 
shortterm business strategy hurting us interests 
japanese officials also criticized low us savings rates low 
investment in production facilities research and development 
slowness to convert to metric measure and underemphasis on export 
promotion and education and training of workers the japanese 
source said 
japan also accused the united states of wasteful use of energy 
and overregulation by government in such areas as antitrust 
practices the ban against selling alaskan oil to japan and 
required use of americanowned shipping the source added 
the us delegation was led by richard mccormack undersecretary 
of state for economic affairs deputy trade representative lynn 
williams assistant treasury secretary charles dallara and commerce

communist leaders met secretly today to endorse a 
threeyear austerity plan and the chinese people were told to brace 
for several years of hard living as the country grapples with 
economic difficulties 
a commentary in the official beijing daily said only through a 
few years of hard work belttightening and unity can we go past 
this stage and continue the construction of our socialist 
modernization 
the communist partys governing central committee was expected 
tp prescribe tighter government controls over the economy and fewer 
marketoriented reforms that could mean the revival of the primacy 
of central planning restoration of the leadership of party members 
in factories and a limit in the growth of collective and private 
enterprise 
the beijing daily commentary said people should realize that 
problems that have built up in past years cannot possibly be 
resolved at once 
it said the serious shortage of funds and raw materials 
afflicting the economy result in part from the recent turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion officialspeak for the crushed 
prodemocracy movement 
the commentary complained that many local officials only pay lip 
service to the nations austerity drive and at the decisive 
moment think of themselves and forget the interest of the 
country 
it noted that chinas impoverished multitudes live in a backward 
economy afflicted with a shortage of resources in the early 1990s 
china will also enter a peak repayment period for its more than 40 
billion in foreign debt 
china inaugurated its austerity program a year ago severely 
restricting credit canceling building projects and cutting 
government spending to slow excessive economic growth and reduce an 
inflation rate of more than 30 percent 
the program has succeeded in cooling down the economy and 
inflation but it has also caused nationwide hardships for 
enterprises lacking funds 
it has also effectively stopped the price reforms and other 
structural changes western economists say are crucial to chinas 
economic development 
last year about onethird of chinas urban residents said their 
living standards had declined because of rising prices large parts 
of the countryside are still without electricity and millions are 
too poor to send their hildren to school or see no economic 
incentives in doing so 
in hong kong the us ambassador to china today expressed 
optimism about longterm prospects for the chinese economy but 
noted that development efforts could easily derail 
ambassador james lilley also said the harsh political rhetoric 
from beijing since the crackdown on the spring prodemocracy 
movement has been a marked step backward for efforts to reform 
the economy 
in june chinas leaders sent troops to clear beijing of 
prodemocracy protesters and soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed 
civilians

the state department citing reports of 
fraudulent soviet exit permits has restricted access to a european 
route used by tens of thousands of soviet jews to come to the 
united states 
a pattern of fraud emerged last month apparently involving some 
individuals in the soviet agency that issues the permits officials 
said monday 
permits had to be dated before oct 1 for soviet jews to obtain 
us visas in rome or vienna and the applicants had to also have 
israeli visas otherwise prospective emigrants are processed 
through the us embassy in moscow 
the new restriction required emigrants to obtain their israeli 
visas by monday as a result soviet jews may remain at home rather 
than waiting in rome or vienna until their entry to the united 
states is approved 
jews who leave the soviet union after monday on israeli visas 
will be presumed to have chosen to emigrate to israel us 
officials said

1986 immigration reform and control act that a report says causes

demonstrations it said that after the june 4 military crackdown in

a year after his failed presidential bid gov 
michael s dukakis said the legacy of his campaign may have been to 
teach a potent lesson to fellow democrats attack 
you had better be ready to attack dukakis said you may 
not like it and the public may not like it but the alternative is 
to watch yourself be trashed and be defeated 
where democrats face tough election battles particularly in 
todays new jersey and virginia gubernatorial and new york citys 
mayoral contests the governor said those candidates have been 
aware of the danger in ignoring attacks 
if theres one contribution ive made to the three races its 
at least to give the three democrats a sense of what not to do 
what the danger is dukakis said monday and i think the three 
of them were very much aware of that from the beginning having 
been forewarned by what happened in the presidential race 
rep james j florio a democrat is running against republican 
rep jim courter in new jersey and democratic lt gov l douglas 
wilder opposes marshall coleman a republican in virginia in new 
york david n dinkins a democrat is running against rudolph w 
guiliani polls show all three democrats lead their opponents 
dukakis said he could redo his presidential campaign he would 
have struck hard at george bush 
but dukakis said he held back because he had won the 
democratic nomination without resorting to such tactics 
i felt however mistakenly that that was really something the 
people wanted that they had had enough negativism for eight years 
enough polarization he said

the federal aviation administration ordered 
inspections of newer boeing 737s for possible missing bolts in a 
doorframe and of older 747s for possible cracks 
the faa said both problems could lead to rapid decompression of 
the planes 
the faa ordered the inspections in separate directives issued 
late last week in the case of the 737s it ordered operators to 
fly the planes at lower than normal altitudes and lower cabin 
pressurizations until they could be inspected 
the faa said some bolts may be missing from the forward 
passenger doorstop in model 300 and model 400 737s 
the 737 directive issued friday affects 18 of the last 20 
737300s and 400s built said boeing commercial airplanes 
spokesman jack gamble so far gamble said no planes have been 
found to have missing bolts 
the inspections must be performed within 20 flights of receipt 
of the directive and the problem fixed as soon as detected 
boeing 737s are twinengine jetliners with the model 300 
carrying 141 passengers and the model 400 156 passengers 
gamble said officials at boeings wichita kan plant which 
assembles fuselage sections of 737s discovered when looking at 
paperwork for the planes that it was possible one of the two bolts 
could have been omitted he said boeing notified the faa of that 
possibility on thursday 
its one of those precautionary things you want to do he 
said 
six of the planes were delivered to us carriers and no bolts 
were missing on those planes gamble said twelve went to either 
foreign airlines or leasing companies and not all have reported in 
the machinists union is on strike against boeing at wichita and 
other plants but gamble said all the construction work on the 
affected airplanes had been completed before the strike began oct 
4 theres no reason to believe the strike had anything to do 
with it he said 
the 747 order was prompted by an operator finding small skin 
cracks in the general area ahead and above the forward passenger

the police lieutenant who 
publicly accused riot squad members of brutality has expanded his 
crusade against the security establishment by forming a union for 
police and prison guards 
although lt gregory rockmans superiors have ordered him not to 
speak to the press rockman invited journalists to a meeting monday 
night at which the police and prisons civil rights union was 
launched government regulations prohibit security force members 
from belonging to unions 
police officials have confirmed that rockman is the subject of a 
departmental inquiry and could face disciplinary action for 
violating orders 
in addition to making unauthorized public statements he has 
acknowledged refusing to accept an order to report for border duty 
far from his home town of mitchells plain near cape town 
i will be very prominent for the next 10 years rockman said 
monday night if they want me out of the police department they 
should kick me out 
rockman said seven policemen and 21 prison employees already had 
joined the new union formed after he was approached by disgruntled 
guards like rockman the other members are mixedrace although he 
said the union was open to whites and blacks 
he said the members had previously raised complaints about 
working conditions through normal channels and were dissatisfied 
with the response 
rockman came to prominence in september when he accused members 
of an allwhite police riot squad of behaving like wild dogs 
when they dispersed and beat protesters and bystanders in 
mitchells plain during a demonstration against the exclusion of 
blacks from national elections 
two white officers were charged with assault in connection with 
the incident they were acquitted last month but the judge 
criticized the behavior of some of the officers in the riot squad 
rockman said the new union would seek to ensure that security 
officers were not exposed to racial discrimination and were able to 
speak freely some prison gaurds had complained that they were 
housed in unused cells he said 
rockman also said the union would campaign against maltreatment 
of prisoners he said some children as young as 10 sometimes are 
kept in prison for months while awaiting trial for crimes such as 
housebreaking 
since entering the media spotlight rockman has written a book 
rockman one mans crusade against apartheid police which is 
to be published at the end of the month

confusion over navigation equipment and warning 
lights led to the grounding of a yugoslavian freighter on a fragile 
coral reef witnesses told a coast guard inquiry 
also monday the federal government filed a civil lawsuit 
seeking 9 million in damages for destruction of the 500foot swath 
of reef in the dry tortugas about 65 miles west of key west 
the suit blames the grounding on the ships unseaworthiness 
and the negligence of those in charge the damage amount 
represents the value of the seized ship and cargo as well as the 
reef damage the us attorneys office said 
the ships captain testified at the opening of the hearing 
monday that his second officer who was in charge at the time of 
the grounding oct 30 became confused while making a minor course 
change 
the move sent the phosphate hauler west into a charted shoal 
instead of east into rebecca channel between the dry tortugas and 
key west ships captain zdravko beran testified a depth finder on 
board was turned off at the time 
i think that he was confused i think that he must go port 
and he went starboard the captain a merchant seaman for 30 
years said in broken english he told me that he did wrong big 
error 
the freighter carrying 14300 tons of phosphate and 143000 
gallons of fuel was refloated without damage thursday and 
impounded by the government 
marine patrol officer gorden sharp testified that second officer 
zvonko baric told him he had mistaken a warning light for a channel 
light and had hit the reef at 12 knots without slowing down 
beran also said he was using one large chart covering an area 
from the mississippi river to the florida keys because a strike had 
held up delivery of more detailed charts

cassandra gethers who was arrested in february after she and her 
daughter were found to be addicted 
she had given birth to a cocaineaddicted son a year before her 
daughter was born and received counseling at the time on the 
dangers of using the drug while pregnant

that issue has been decided carney said

japanese investors should adopt new cooperative 
alliances with us firms to ease fears they are buying up 
america and help revitalize the us manufacturing sector a us 
businessman said today 
peter g peterson former us secretary of commerce and the 
chairman of the blackstone group of new york called on japanese 
investors to participate in a global privatesector marshall 
plan to help the us manufacturing sector 
the marshall plan was the financial aid program drafted in 1947 
by us secretary of state george marshall to help rebuild 
warravaged western europe 
the united states desperately needs investment and japan has 
immense capital the question is how can it be done so that its 
both economically and politically productive peterson told 
reporters at the foreign correspondents club of japan 
he defended japanese direct investments in the united states 
such as mitsubishi estates recent purchase of a stake in 
rockefeller center and sony corps 34 billion buyout of columbia 
pictures which the blackstone group helped put together 
given huge us trade and federal deficits and the need to 
service the almost 1 trillion us foreign debt we need a 
voracious amount of foreign financing peterson said arguing 
against curbs on further investments 
peterson said japan should do more to ease american fears about 
the socalled buying up of america by going all out to open its 
own markets to foreign investment and trade and by avoiding 
excessive concentration of acquisitions in such areas as hawaii 
the fears of americans are real he said 
in every japanese acquisition of a new york skyscraper or a 
waikiki hotel some see an inevitable pattern of japanese 
ascendancy and american decline he said 
japanese and us firms should form joint ventures and minority 
investment arrangements that enable both sides to exchange 
technology market access and distribution facilities while 
avoiding the political problems and managerial pitfalls of 
speculative acquisitions he said 
japanese companies and the government could do more to help ease 
trade frictions he said 
if the japanese companies are not more creative and flexible 
in permitting foreign companies to participate directly in this 
market i think it will have a serious backlash effect 
peterson said

a federal judge has cleared the way for logging 
next year in some of the northwests oldest forests prime nesting 
spots for the rare spotted owl 
us district judge william dwyer on monday ruled that an 
agreement reached by congress that allows cutting of some of the 
giant trees is constitutional according to vic sher lawyer for 
the sierra club legal defense club 
the order turned back a challenge by environmentalists and 
vacated an injunction against timber cutting on federal land in 
washington and oregon and a nov 13 trial of the environmentalists 
lawsuit 
i would hope we could start fairly quickly to auction timber 
in 13 national forests affected by the lawsuit said john 
butruille the northwests regional forester for the us forest 
service 
congress compromise also requires the forest service and bureau 
of land management to start protecting old growth trees which are 
at least 200 years old 
dwyer gave no explanation in his ruling which upheld a section 
of an appropriations bill passed by congress and signed by 
president bush last month the judge said an opinion will follow 
according to sher 
what took him so long said dennis daughtery president of 
the contract loggers association 
the disputed trees probably should have been hewed down over 
100 years ago theyre just taking up good growing room in the 
forests daughtery said 
obviously were really pleased said forest service chief 
f dale robertson were glad to see the court say we can 
continue 
plainiffs contended congress acted unconstitutionally in 
creating the oneyear compromise crafted to satisfy the timber 
industry and the advocates for the owl which nests primarily in 
the old growth forests of the northwest 
the us fish and wildlife service is considering whether to 
list the owl on the endangered species list 
its a disappointing ruling for us sher said but our 
quarrel is not with judge dwyer or the federal court its with 
congress which has put federal agencies above the law and stripped 
the courts of their ability to enforce the law 
the sierra club legal defense fund representing the audubon 
society the oregon natural resources council and other 
environmental groups had asked dwyer to proceed with a trial the 
lawsuit contended that logging on federal land in the northwest in 
spotted owl habitat would violate federal environmental laws 
in march dwyer blocked timber sales in washington and oregon in 
owlsensitive areas the blocked sales total more than 1 billion 
board feet 
last may dwyer signed an order putting the lawsuit on hold 
congress then stepped in 
sher said the plaintiffs havent decided whether to appeal 
mondays decision 
its hard to say what the next step will be until we see the 
judges reasoning and we see how the forest service proceeds with 
implementing the new legislation he said

a convicted drug dealers sworn testimony that 
he gave crack cocaine to mayor marion barry several times is 
reviving questions about whether the mayor uses drugs 
charles lewis 49 testified under oath in us district court 
on monday that he gave barry cocaine at least three times while 
barry visited lewis room at a downtown washington hotel late last 
year 
despite many press accounts of investigations against the mayor 
lewis statement was the first ontherecord underoath accusation 
that barry the citys mayor since 1979 had been given drugs 
im not worried at all about this barry who has repeatedly 
denied ever using drugs told reporters monday he described lewis 
as a convicted felon and added hell say anything in court 
trying to save his own hide 
the federal investigation began in december when city police 
called off an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from lewis on 
discovering that the mayor was in lewis hotel room 
barry who has described lewis as an old friend acknowledged 
making at least six visits to lewis hotel during that period but 
the mayor has steadfastly denied using seeing or purchasing drugs 
during those trips 
the mayors attorney kenneth mundy scoffed at the defendants 
comments 
we question the credibility of the source mundy said 
charles lewis is a besieged and beleaguered man who knows that 
his only salvation comes by not giving truthful statements about 
the mayor 
rumors about barrys alleged use of drugs have persisted for 
years in 1984 karen johnson a convicted drug dealer went to 
prison on contempt of court charges after refusing to tell federal 
prosecutors whether she used cocaine with barry or sold drugs to 
him and other top city officials 
barry who is married admitted to having had an unspecified 
personal relationship with johnson but denied ever using drugs 
with her 
lewis statement came as judge stanley sporkin was reviewing a 
plea bargain calling for lewis to plead guilty to two counts of 
conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine 
the second count centered on lewis activities at the hotel last 
december and made reference to lewis distributing cocaine to one 
individual on at least three separate occasions 
because i dont want to look like a fool was one of the 
individuals you gave cocaine to the mayor of this city sporkin 
asked lewis 
as the defendant was preparing to answer assistant us 
attorney judith retchin asked to discuss the matter privately with 
the judge 
during the bench conference sporkin was overheard to say i 
dont think it fair that we read all this in the newspaper 
apparently in reference to press leaks about the case hes under 
oath and should answer 
sporkin then overruled the prosecutors objections to the 
question and ordered lewis to answer 
after hearing the query repeated by the court stenographer 
lewis replied yes your honor crack cocaine 
when sporkin reminded lewis that he was under oath and asked him 
whether he was telling the truth lewis replied no question 
about it sir 
sporkin then accepted the plea agreement and the two guilty 
pleas under it sentencing was set for jan 8 
lewis faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 1 
million fine for each count lewis had originally faced a 14count 
indictment that included perjury charges and additional counts of 
cocaine distribution and possession but prosecutors dropped 12 of 
those counts 
lewis was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in the 
virgin islands earlier this year his sentencing in that case was 
postponed indefinitely monday as part of the plea bargain 
after the court proceeding lewis attorney alan b soschin 
predicted that lewis will serve between 10 and 12 months in jail 
the minimum called for under the rules governing the plea bargain 
as part of the agreement lewis is bound to cooperate with 
prosecutors in the district of columbia drug investigation 
us attorney jay b stephens refused to comment on the case or 
whether barry is now a target of the investigation barry has 
testified twice before the grand jury hearing evidence on the lewis 
case 
lewis a former district of columbia government official had 
been a consultant to the virgin islands government he said he was 
staying in the washington hotel while looking for work

cancellation of the military part of the republics parade 
striking miners in the soviet arctic joined a celebration with 
slogans urging the government to allow greater independence and 
improve living and working conditions 
the unprecedented alternative march wound through the capital as 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet leadership stood atop 
the lenin mausoleum and reviewed the traditional display of 
military hardware 
the official tolerance of a counterdemonstration on the 
hallowed national holiday showed how far the soviet union has come 
from the authoritarian rule of gorbachevs predecessors 
so did the toneddown nature of the red square celebrations 
marking the 72nd anniversary of the revolution that brought the 
communists to power in russia not as much emphasis was placed on 
military might as in previous years 
were tired of 70 years of communist power with nothing having 
changed for the better and this is our protest said marcher 
taisya shlyonova a pensioner the demonstrators represented a 
broad spectrum of unofficial groups 
we dont want the people to be sheep that can be led as they 
have been led for 72 years popular prosecutor telman gdlyan 
said power must be taken away from the apparatus and given to 
the people 
leaders of the independent event steered their marchers away 
from red square and a possible confrontation with authorities or 
with the thousands of marchers at the official ceremonies 
responding to posters plastered around the city on the eve of 
revolution day activists assembled near the dynamo metro station 
two hours before the start of official ceremonies 
their route took them to a fork with one street leading toward 
red square and some demonstrators initially headed that way 
however leaders made appeals from a sound truck and steered them 
instead to a route sanctioned by city officials 
organizers said they had been told by authorities they would not 
be permitted to march through the square because they could not 
guarantee the march would remain orderly 
the marchers many walking arm in arm chanted slogans in 
support of maverick communist boris n yeltsin and other reformist 
members of the congress of peoples deputies and shouted down 
with the kgb secret police 
some brandished posters scorning the 1917 communist revolution 
glorified at the official ceremonies 
seventytwo years on the road to nowhere said one poster 
others proclaimed down with ligachev a reference to yegor 
ligachev the hardline communist on the ruling politburo who has 
come to symbolize resistance to economic and social reform 
the marchers represented a wide spectrum of interests from 
environmental groups protesting construction of a nuclear power 
station to church groups demanding freedom of worship in the 
officially atheist communist state 
last year such unofficial groups marched in some soviet cities 
on revolution day but this was the first time they took to the 
streets of moscow on the holiday 
in the southern republic of moldavia police beat people in a 
crowd of thousands that gathered near a monument to national hero 
king stephen the great yuri rozhgo a spokesman for the moldavian 
peoples front organization said in a telephone call from kishinev 
the republics capital 
more were beaten when police dispersed a crowd of a couple 
hundred peoples front supporters on lenin prospekt a couple of 
hours later he said 
officials canceled the military part of the parade thousands of 
peoples front supporters marched the parade route with slogans 
condemning the police and the republics leadership rozhgo said 
in red square the traditional parade of tanks troops and 
bannerwaving marchers selected by their workplaces passed through 
on schedule 
it was broadcast on staterun television which made no 
reference to the unofficial march 
gorbachev acknowledging the countrys troubles in an informal 
television interview during the ceremonies said abandonment of the 
old system of central control without installing a new system has 
resulted in a loss or weakening of control 
but to go back would be the greatest mistake he said 
calling instead for faster movement toward a new economic order he 
gave few details but progressives have recently criticized the 
regime for halfmeasures that they say only make matters worse 
longtime observers said the official ceremonies this year were 
considerably toned down from previous years when the kremlin 
leadership used the parade to show off the soviets military might 
few missiles were in evidence today antitank guided missile 
systems and surfacetoair missile resupply vehicles were dropped 
this year diplomats said they had said they expected just one new 
weapon an updated version of the t72 tank to join the parade 
in addition party slogans were far less militant than just a 
few years ago 
in another expression of discontent a local chapter of the 
nationalist peoples front movement in riga capital of the baltic 
republic of latvia declared the bolsheviks seizure of power was 
not a revolution but a government coup 
the group said the takeover cut short the process of 
democratization that started after the february 1917 revolution 
that overthrew the czar 
czar nicholas ii abdicated to a provisional government that was 
overthrown eight months later by the bolsheviks

a bomb planted by the irish 
republican army exploded today outside the home of a senior police 
official but the man and his family narrowly escaped injury 
david mellor assistant chief of the royal ulster constabulary 
had returned from his mothers funeral in england hours before the 
bomb blew up below the living room window of his home in drumbo 
outside belfast officials said 
mellor had just left the living room when the blast ripped 
through the bulletproof window behind an armchair where he had been 
reading his wife was in another room 
mellors 7monthold daughter rebecca was asleep in a cot in the 
living room and was showered with debris a police spokesman said 
his 18monthold daughter rachel was asleep in an adjoining bedroom 
both infants were only six to eight feet from the bomb when it 
went off the spokesman said speaking anonymously in keeping 
with british custom they had a miraculous escape 
he said the bomb caused extensive damage 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility and in a 
statement to belfast news media said it had been watching mellors 
movements for some time 
the ira said the bomb contained three pounds of explosives 
we deliberately placed a small charge only because we were 
aware of the young children in the house it said otherwise we 
could undoubtedly have guaranteed mellors death with a larger 
charge 
the englishborn mellor 49 is in charge of the royal ulster 
constabularys complaints and discipline branch he is scheduled to 
take over as deputy chief constable of south wales later this month 
eight royal ulster constabulary officers including one chief 
superintendent and two superintendents have been murdered by the 
ira this year 
the ira is fighting to end british rule of northern ireland and 
unite the predominantly protestant province with the roman catholic 
republic of ireland

a check of old case files led straight to a 
bathtub in chicago where authorities arrested a man in the slaying 
of a woman 29 years ago 
you dont clear one this old too often said dallas county 
sheriffs investigator tom reilly who helped break the case 
reilly and investigator gary lachman last week came across a 
murder warrant for robert lee mitchell in the shooting of his 
former girlfriend billie marie redmon phillips in dallas in 1960 
as the detectives do routinely they asked for an information 
sheet on mitchell from the fbi which categorizes every person 
arrested by fingerprints and not by name when the detectives 
received the file on mitchell it included a 1985 arrest of a man 
named billy jackson on an assault charge in chicago 
chicago police furnished a phone number for the man 
we called and said we were doing a survey reilly said i 
talked to his wife she gave me his name she confirmed they lived 
at the same address she even confirmed that he was in the other 
room reading the paper 
fbi agents arrested jackson formerly mitchell in his bathtub 
on friday lachman said 
he was surprised he was arrested reilly said he didnt 
deny he was the same person 
mitchell had fled after the slaying relatives later said he had 
died and the fbi closed the case in 1980 sheriffs detectives 
said 
but the detectives knew mitchell was still alive because his 
social security number was still active and no one had claimed 
death benefits on it

christian teenagers today beat up 
vendors who ignored a strike that was called to show solidarity 
with the army commander gen michel aoun in his opposition to the 
new president witnesses said 
rene mouawad who was elected president sunday consulted with 
politicians in syriancontrolled north lebanon in an effort to form 
a government 
aoun who headed a christian cabinet for 14 months prior to 
mouawads election remained in the shellravaged presidential 
palace in suburban baabda refusing to relinquish it to mouawad 
he termed the presidential election unconstitutional 
about 500 youths chanting aoun is the legitimate leader 
gathered outside the french embassy in hazmieh just south of 
baabda they waved portraits of aoun lebanese flags and slogans 
calling on french president francois mitterrand to protect 
lebanon 
france has been the christians main protector here it ruled 
lebanon until independence in 1943 
about 40 of the demonstrators began a sitin outside the 
compound they raised a banner that said mitterand has 
disappointed us 
paris washington and other major arab and international 
governments have backed mouawad a maronite catholic and a 32year 
veteran of lebanese politics 
he was voted into office by lebanese legislators who also 
approved a peace accord giving the moslem majority more power in 
decision making aoun opposed the accord because it did not set a 
deadline for withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
his main problem with mouawad is the presidents close links 
with syria syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate aoun wants them out because they are 
the moslems main supporters 
a committee of christian youths who support aoun called a 
general strike for a fourth day in east beirut and the christian 
heartland to the north which is controlled by aouns 20000 troops 
only bakeries were allowed to open and thousands of people 
lined up outside 
some vendors in the east beirut neighborhood of ashrafiyeh 
defied the strike call and opened their stands young demonstrators 
attacked them with sticks witnesses reported 
we want peace we want to work to make money we live 
handtomouth a vendor shouted as teenagers beat him up one 
witness reported 
he said some demonstrators were kids around the age of 12 
the others were slightly older 
the vegetable vendors and the kids fought with fists and 
sticks policemen at a nearby police station did not interfere in 
fact they didnt dare interfere because they know the 
demonstrators are backed by the army another witness said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said hundreds of demonstrators drove by in cars decorated 
with aouns pictures and lebanese flags shouting orders to abide 
by the strike 
a car mechanic said we want an end to war weve had enough 
what more does the general want does he want to get the 
maronites catholics slaughtered he said he identified himself 
only as fares and added you publish my name and the generals 
intelligence men will pick me up in 10 minutes 
they didnt spare the patriarch he said referring to the 
attack early monday on maronite patriarch nasrallah sfeir the 
highest christian religious authority in lebanon 
proaoun demonstrators ransacked his compound in bkirki north 
of beirut shouted insults at the patriarch and forced him to kneel 
on the floor and kiss a poster of aoun 
sfeir supported mouawad 
mouawad has been at his home in the mountain resort of zghorta 
in north lebanon where dozens of parliamentrians former prime 
ministers and senior politicians visited him for consultations 
in west beirut an old stone villa was being prepared for 
mouawad 
the baabda palace is a wreck it was destroyed in six months of 
ferocious fighting between aoun and syrian troops the fighting was 
halted by a cesaefire in september

israeli aircraft rocketed bases of the 
shiite moslem guerrilla group hezbollah in southeastern lebanon 
this morning there were no immediate reports of casualties 
reporters in nabatiyeh said at least two helicopter gunships 
were involved in the attack smoke billowed from the stricken 
targets as ground defenders fired at the israeli aircraft with 
antiaircraft guns no hits were observed 
an israeli army communique said hezbollah targets were struck in 
mazraat ayn busiwar 14 miles north of the israeli border all

not mention casualties or damage 
a police spokesman in lebanon said hezbollah fighters would not 
allow police into the area and that it was not known if anyone was 
killed or injured 
well only know if they evacuate any wounded to hospitals in 
sidon he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
an israeli army spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said several targets were struck he refused to elaborate 
no reason for the raid was given but military officials have 
several times accused guerrillas of hezbollah of taking part in 
attacks in the security zone or of attempting to infiltrate israel 
through the border strip 
israel established the 6 to 10milewide zone after pulling the 
bulk of its troops out of lebanon in 1985 following a threeyear 
occupation of the south the area is intended to prevent 
crossborder raids on israel 
it was israels 13th bombing raid in lebanon this year and the 
first since september 20 when planes struck a palestinian base at 
naameh just south of the lebanese capital of beirut

hong kong and was whisked to the secluded diaoyutai state 
guesthouse in western beijing

foreign sources said he is expected to meet top officials 
including senior leader deng xiaoping

said we have to deal with the future and the future requires a 
resumption of dialogue based on mutual respect

improving relations although the chinese repeated their claims 
that the united states was interfering in its internal affairs

more than 60 nations today urged 
the world to stabilize by the year 2000 the emission of gases 
blamed for the greenhouse effect over opposition from the 
united states the soviet union and japan 
most of the participants at the 68nation conference on global 
warming adopted a declaration saying that carbon dioxide emissions 
should be stabilized within 10 years as a first step toward 
fighting the pollution problem 
environmentalists were bitter about the refusal of the united 
states soviet union and japan to sign the declaration 
the conference is a total failure and the united states and 
japan have sabotaged it said daniel becker an official of the 
sierra club a washingtonbased environmentalist group 
the dutch hosts of the twoday ministerial meeting had hoped 
to align all the participating nations unanimously behind a 
commitment to stabilize emissions by the end of the century and to 
begin reducing them in 2005 
william k reilly chief administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency said the distinction was between those 
countries that want to commit themselves to stabilization by the 
year 2000 and those including the united states who are not 
prepared to say so at this time 
on monday reilly said we believe in a reduction of carbon 
dioxide but were not prepared to say by what time and by what 
level 
reilly said the countries should wait for completion of studies 
by the intergovernmental panel on climate change a forum trying to 
find ways of reducing global warming 
the level at which the emissions were to be stabilized will be 
set next year by the unsponsored climate change panel which is 
planning a meeting in washington in february and the world climate 
conference scheduled for late 1990 according to the nations 
declaration 
earlier japanese delegates said they were awaiting more 
scientific data on climate change and on the economic effects of 
drastic measures to curb the greenhouse effect which is believed 
by some scientists to be the cause of a slight warming of the 
earths atmosphere 
some scientists fear the phenomenon could eventually lead to the 
flooding of coastal areas and expansion of deserts 
carbon dioxide is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect 
in 1988 the united states accounted for nearly 24 percent of total 
world emissions of the gas according to the dutch environment 
ministry much carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fuels 
such as coal and gasoline 
the final declaration also called for ways to provide money to 
third world nations to help them cope with the consequences of 
climatic change 
participating nations also said that by the end of the century 
an annual 30million acre reforestation program should be under way 
in the tropics the destruction of rain forest is believed to 
contribute to the greenhouse effect

the supreme court today refused to ease the 
technical requirements facing people who sue to protect the 
environment 
the justices ruled 72 against an oregon farming couple saying 
the victory it took olaf and mary hallstrom three years and 95000 
to win against their county never should have been ruled on by a 
federal court 
but the hallstroms are free to start all over again justice 
sandra day oconnor wrote for the court 
the hallstroms trial victory was overturned by a federal 
appeals court because their lawyer had failed to notify federal and 
state environmental officials as required by the law they sued 
under before filing the 1982 suit 
the suit contended that a tillamook county ore landfill 
adjacent to what is left of the hallstroms 200acre dairy farm 
caused or contributed to the pollution of their water supply 
despite the failure to notify government officials 60 days 
before the suit was filed a federal judge allowed the suit to 
proceed and in 1985 ordered the county to remedy violations of 
federal environmental law within two years 
the judge turned down the hallstroms request for 95000 in 
lawyer fees and the couple appealed 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1987 ruled that the 
hallstroms suit should have been dismissed before any trial 
because of the failure to notify 
that ruling was upheld today 
where a party suing under the citizen suit provisions of the 
resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 fails to meet the 
notice and 60day delay requirement the district court must 
dismiss the action as barred by the terms of the statute 
oconnor wrote 
she added that the hallstroms are not being deprived of their 
right to a day in court because they remain free to give notice 
and file their suit in compliance with the statute to enforce 
pertinent environmental standards 
oconnor was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun john paul stevens 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan dissented 
stating in an opinion by marshall that the decision ill serves 
both judicial economy and congress purposes in passing the 
environmental protection law 
the hallstroms lawyer kim buckley of portland informed the 
county of their intention to sue well before the 60day period 
required by the federal law but buckley did not give the same 
required notification to the federal environmental protection 
agency or the oregon department of environmental quality 
in arguments before the justices last month buckley urged the 
court to look at the spirit of the law contending that its 
just not fair to make the hallstroms jump through a judicial 
hoop that has no purpose 
but in her opinion today oconnor said the notification 
requirement was intended by congress to give agencies a 60day 
nonadversarial period to achieve compliance with the 
environmental law 
the case is hallstrom vs tillamook county 8842

the army is training young surgeons to handle 
war carnage by sending them to the emergency room at a ghetto 
hospital inundated with victims of gang violence 
two army residents recently completed two months training at 
martin luther king jrdrew medical center in the citys watts 
section county supervisors were to vote today on allowing four 
more surgeons to train there next year 
at king we see the kind of penetrating trauma that we just 
dont see at other hospitals said dr john mcphail chief of 
surgery at william beaumont army medical center in el paso texas 
its a place where the residents will have to treat a large 
volume of highvelocity wounds the kind we would see in war 
army doctors used to receive their trauma surgery training at 
public hospitals near their home bases but the young surgeons 
rarely see the kinds of gaping multiple wounds caused by automatic 
and semiautomatic gunfire common to gang violence here where more 
than 353 gangrelated slayings were reported last year 
dr john holcomb a fourthyear resident at the army hospital in 
el paso completed his twomonth stint in trauma surgery at 
kingdrew last week the hospital is at the armys fort bliss 
it makes sense that since were military surgeons well treat 
the kinds of wounds that we would see in combat he said and 
thats definitely what i saw there 
the 430bed countyrun teaching hospital treated almost 3500 
trauma victims in 1988 or nearly 40 percent of the countys trauma 
patients health officials estimate that doctors there treat more 
than 100 gunshot cases and dozens of stabbings each month 
dr arthur fleming chief of trauma and surgery at kingdrew 
proposed the facility as an army training site to boost manpower at 
the overburdened trauma unit 
army officials said they hope to make it a permanent part of 
their surgical training

the american civil liberties union has 
gone to court to get camp hill prison officials to remove the 
shackles and handcuffs used to bind some 1000 inmates in pairs 
since a riot last month 
us district judge sylvia rambo set a hearing for today in a 
suit filed by the pennsylvania branch of the aclu on behalf of four 
inmates 
the suit also claims inmates have not had adequate clothing 
heat plumbing food or medical treatment since the uprising was 
put down oct 27 the rioting left 123 people injured and half the 
prison in flames 
the continued restraint of the inmates is designed solely to 
inflict cruel and unusual punishment said the suit filed monday 
i think its torture we do not treat animals this way said 
aclu legal director stefan presser 
a corrections department spokeswoman said about 1200 inmates 
remain restrained and in locked cells 
another spokesman kenneth robinson said the staff is trying to 
identify inmates who were not directly involved in the rioting 
those inmates will be moved to other blocks where prisoners are not 
shackled he said 
the purpose of the handcuffs is for security he said we 
are concerned about the safety of both staff and inmates 
robinson would not comment on the specifics of the aclu suit 
four guards and two inmates hurt in the rioting remain 
hospitalized

bush said leaders in western europe dont seem to agree with 
some of the poltical criticism i get from capitol hill on dealing 
with the nations that have been in the soviet sphere since world 
war ii 
bush said that despite the impact of his veto of appropriations 
bills including abortion funding he is not going to budge on the 
issue he said abortion is not the most important issue on his 
agenda but that he will not approve measures that compel the use 
of tax dollars for abortion 
it supports compulsory abortion he said i am not going 
to do that 
in his opening statement bush elected last nov 8 looked back 
at his term so far and cited both foreignpolicy and domestic 
initiatives 
he said he was pleased he had kept his pledge not to raise taxes 
and said neither he nor congress must flinch from our obligation 
to keep this nations deficit from moving down 
bush was asked whether the us action freeing money that had 
had held in a fund to back up claims by american banks against 
iran could help lead to release of the hostages even though the 
administration claims the issues are separate 
i dont know the answer to that id like to get this 
underbrush cleaned out now bush said 
he said he hoped the current government of iran will do what 
they can to influence those who hold those hostages meanwhile 
bush said were continuing behind the scenes to follow rabbit

voters stood in lines more than a mile 
long today as balloting began in an election that is to lead to 
independence for africas last colony 
authorities reported violations of election rules and at least 
one attempt to distribute bogus pamphlets but said there had been 
no major disturbances 
the behavior of the voting public has been an example to the 
rest of the world said gerhard roux spokesman for the south 
africaninstalled territorial government 
the unmonitored elections are for a 72member assembly that 
is to write a constitution namibia ruled by south africa for 74 
years is expected to become independent early next year 
after all the years of waiting the people of namibia 
themselves and no one else will have their say in free and fair 
elections the un special representative martti ahtisaari 
said in a radio broadcast as five days of voting began in the 
southern african territory 
there are 701488 registered voters in namibia about 60 percent 
of them illiterate the population was 13 million in 1981 when 
the last census was taken but is believed to be far higher now 
the key issue in the elections was whether the southwest africa 
peoples organization swapo favored to win the most votes would 
capture the twothirds majority needed to write a constitution 
without consulting any of the other nine parties 
today we are finally burying apartheid colonialism swapo 
leader sam nujoma told reporters at a polling station in katutura 
the main black neighborhood on the edge of windhoek 
there is a beautiful lady expecting a baby nujoma told a 
cheering singing crowd at a rally monday night that lady is 
mother namibia and that baby is the freedom and independence of 
this land 
the queue of voters stretched for about 12 miles when the polls 
opened in katutura long lines also were reported elsewhere 
namibians may vote daily through saturday and chief electoral 
officer abraham visser said he was confident results would be 
available nov 15 
more than 7000 un military and civilian representatives one 
for every 1000 voters are in predominantly black namibia and 
have supervised a massive campaign to promote voting and prevent 
fraud 
posters and television advertisements financed by un and 
territorial officials have stressed that ballots will be secret and 
urged voters to vote without fear 
all voters are required to dip their fingers in invisible ink 
after they cast their ballot the ink is indelible for five days 
when voters enter the booths at the polling stations they must put 
their fingers under an ultraviolet light which will reveal the 
ink if they already have voted 
officials said most of this sparsely populated desert territory 
now is tranquil but the fourmonth election campaign was marked by 
sporadic violence and intimidation including the sept 12 
assassination of the only ranking white in swapo anton lubowski 
un spokesman fred eckhard cautioned that the peace is a very 
fragile peace 
in new york un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
noted monday in a final preelection report that almost one in 10 
namibians had a gun permit and an unknown number were armed 
illegally 
while at this time there have been marked improvements in the 
security situation on the eve of the election i remain vigilant to 
the possibility of a deterioration in the field of law and order 
perez de cuellar said 
in neighboring south africa president fw de klerk urged 
namibians to cast your vote in the interest of peace and 
prosperity 
the strife and bitterness the mistrust and misunderstandings 
of the past must be put behind us he said 
south africa seized mineralrich namibia from its german 
colonizers in 1915 the league of nations forerunner of the united 
nations provided south africa with a mandate to administer the 
territory 
the un revoked the mandate in 1966 and swapo launched a 
guerrilla war later that year after south africa refused to grant 
independence 
more than 20000 people mostly swapo guerrillas died in the 
bush war that finally ended in april 
nujoma said his leftleaning organization would accept any 
election result certified by the united nations 
the organization once espoused a marxistleninist oneparty 
state but nujoma last month promised that swapo has no intention 
of imposing a oneparty political system on the namibian people 
against their will 
its chief rival is the democratic turnhalle alliance a 
moderate multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy 
and was part of a south africaninstalled transitional government

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference tuesday 
president bush well good morning and i im back again 
laughter and i just heard you brit ive got to be careful on 
these dates laughter today is november 7th and i was elected 
on november 8th but it was the second tuesday and so i want to 
take this election day the anniversary of my own election to 
briefly reflect on the last 10 months 
i believe that weve had so far a successful first year in 
office and although we havent reached the actual anniversary 
mark january 20th its a good chance to take stock of the 
situation particularly as congress is winding down there is 
legislation yet to be passed and certainly opportunities to be 
developed but im very pleased that our administration has come 
together rapidly with good people with good ideas and with a 
quiet sense of purpose that promises great progress in the years 
ahead 
and around the world weve seen the most dramatic moves toward 
democracy in at least 40 years as people of one country after 
another have expressed their yearning for freedom and in eastern 
europe and in central america and in the soviet union important 
decisions have been made for freedom or reforms and weve 
supported those efforts with a substantial aid package to poland 
trade benefits for hungary a bipartisan agreement congress on 
central america coordinated international support for eastern 
europe reforms special arms control initiatives on chemical 
weapons and conventional forces in europe and then in progress in 
start talks 
in addition weve set the timeframe for a summit with the 
soviets and were on the verge of an informal meeting with 
president gorbachev 
one area that has not changed is the underlying strength of the 
american economy we have the longest peacetime economic expansion 
in history 119 million americans at work the creation of over 20 
million new jobs since 1982 the unemployment rate is only 53 
percent a rate that weve not achieved for a full year since 1970 
inflation remains moderate im not happy with it but its 
moderate and appears to be under control 
though the economy is sound we must make real progress on 
deficit reduction sequestration is a drastic action but neither 
the administration nor the congress must flinch from our obligation 
to keep this nations deficit moving down and ultimately reduce the 
debt and i am pleased that i have kept my pledge on taxes our 
savings and loan system has been redesigned the congress accepted 
my proposals giving our workers a higher minimum wage and 
establishing a training wage for the first time 
the brady plan for dealing with the third world debt has been 
successfully demonstrated in mexico and costa rica many nations 
problems remain unsolved but the brady plan is widely accepted 
its in the setting of internal strength that we are poised to deal 
effectively with external change and to provide new directions for 
our society 
at the education summit and in legislative initiatives on clean 
air ethics educational excellence violent crime child care and 
our national drug strategy we offer new approaches for improving 
the quality of our lives and so i urge the congress to move 
quickly to enact these proposals my approach to congress has been 
based on a bipartisan effort i think everybody here knows that it 
started off with an effort to work with the leadership in a 
bipartisan manner and so we could reach agreement on major issues 
in the course of our debates there have sometimes been pointed and 
somewhat sharp attacks but i am going to continue to extend my 
hand to congress in seeking solutions to the challenges that we 
face

president bush said today he will veto a 144 
billion foreign aid bill if congress insists on including a 
provision authorizing a us contribution to a united nations 
family planning agency 
they are asking me to accept things i cannot accept bush 
said in response to a question at a white house news conference 
he said he could not approve the use of us tax dollars for 
programs that require abortions in such overpopulated countries as 
china 
house and senate negotiators continuing work on a foreign aid 
bill agreed monday on the provision involving family planning 
efforts through the auspices of the un 
as they worked through a long list of disagreements conferees 
for the two sides agreed to accept senate language that would 
reverse a fiveyear policy and send 15 million to the un 
population fund in fiscal 1990 
bush under pressure from antiabortion groups had said earlier 
that he would veto the bill if it included money for the population 
fund the agency carries on programs in china where its opponents 
say severe official restrictions on family size have led to forced 
abortions and sterilizations 
the house conferees voted 83 to accept the senatepassed 
provision sponsored by sen barbara mikulski dmd that also 
stipulated none of the money could go directly into programs in 
china 
administration officials said late monday they believed the 
provision giving money to the un agency still could be overturned 
when a compromise bill goes back to the house floor for final 
approval 
the negotiators hoped to complete work on the measure on 
wednesday and send it back to both chambers for approval 
the aid for eastern europe included 200 million towards a 1 
billion international fund to stabilize polands economy and money 
to set up private sector development programs of 45 million in 
poland and 5 million in hungary 
a series of smaller initiatives would promote environmental 
cleanups in both countries educational and cultural exchanges 
peace corps activities and the efforts of union and other groups to 
promote democratic change 
in addition the bill would make available 200 million to 
guarantee payment for us exports to poland and 40 million in 
risk insurance for us commercial ventures through the overseas 
private investment corp because of questions about polands credit 
worthiness it is unclear whether those funds will be tapped 
both countries have been on the forefront of changes sweeping 
eastern europe the result of failing economies under communism and 
of moscows looser grip poland this year elected its first 
noncommunist government in four decades and hungary has torn down 
border fences that form its part of the iron curtain 
the conference committee also agreed to put 125 million into 
new military intelligence and law enforcement efforts in the war 
on drugs in colombia peru and bolivia 
another issue that had been the basis for a veto threat appeared 
to be evaporating said rep mickey edwards rokla because the 
administration had decided against a fight that was a provision 
stemming from the irancontra affair that would bar the use of 
foreign aid money to carry out any policy contrary to us law 
other major differences remained however one was an accounting 
gimmick used in the senate bill to meet its 1990 budget target 
which would force some 500 million in spending into the following 
fiscal year the house was strenuously opposed to that maneuver

washn we face 
i spoke ten months ago of a kinder and gentler america and im 
more convinced today than ever that we can shed light in the dark 
corners of our nation and give hope to the homeless and help to the 
needy inspiration to millions of americans who want to reach out 
and help their neighbors and i am pleased at the progress on this 
socalled points of light initiative 
these challenges coupled with our successes to date have made 
these first ten months especially gratifying to me and give me 
great hope for the future so i on this occasion of the election 
anniversary of the election i want to thank the american people 
on this election day for giving me this opportunity to serve im 
enjoying it i like the challenge and ill be glad to take 
questions 
terry 
q mr president the united states is returning 567 million in 
frozen assets to iran but says the action is not related to the 
plight of the eight americans held hostage in lebanon 
nevertheless in line with your comment that goodwill brings 
goodwill do you hope that this will encourage iran to help win the 
hostages release 
a well as i say i carry the fate of the hostages with me 
every single day so of course i hope that iran will use what 
influence it has to get these hostages released 
q well do you think that this could be a catalyst mr 
rafsanjani 
a i dont know terry its a very good question and i dont 
know the answer to that they owe money you know they we have 
accounts that where they owe american interests money and vice 
versa and id like to get this underbrush cleaned out now i think 
they have made some positive statements but i dont whether it 
will work that way or not i hope i hope that they will do what 
they can to influence those who hold these hostages were 
continuing behind the scenes to try go follow certain rabbit 
trails there and so far they have ended up at dead ends 
q mr president 
a yes helen 
q despite your aid packages to hungary and poland and so forth 
president carter says youve really been slow on the uptake on one 
of the most transforming politicals events of our time you have 
failed to show the leadership youve failed to put the us ahead 
of the curve on these things that are happening and you are going 
to the summit without any initiatives at all and you i mean at 
least youve boasted about it why dont you have some new ideas of 
what to talk about 
a now helen that is not a kinder and gentler way to 
phrase your question we have done plenty and the fact that some 
critics are out there equating progress with spending more money 
doesnt bother me in the least look at the dynamic changes that 
are taking place around the world 
q inaudible 
a well id like to hear some specific suggestions other than 
triple the spending on every initiative we are working closely 
with our allies we are trying to facilitate the change i dont 
hear complaints coming out of our allies or indeed out of hungary 
or poland or eastern europe weve got a seasoned team that is 
evaluating the change i will have a wonderful opportunity to 
discuss the change with mr gorbachev but i cant be all concerned 
when people jump up and say the answer is to spend more money 
q no that isnt it 
a well what is their answer 
q the perception is that european leaders are leading the way 
and are telling you what is really happening and we have been 
sitting back and letting it all happen without doing anything 
a well thats the perception of some that arent quite as 
familiar with the problem as i am and it is not the perception of 
the

an air force academy cheerleader 
was kicked off the squad for swinging a chicken by its head during 
halftime at a football game against army officials said 
the cadet who wasnt identified also was ordered by the school 
to perform 100 hours of public service at the humane society said 
academy spokesman col mike wallace on monday 
officials at the academy and the humane society said monday they 
received several calls from spectators faculty members and cadets 
about mistreatment of the birds 
people complained that a cheerleader had swung a chicken by its 
head and that a second chicken was tossed into the crowd which 
batted it around before releasing it said larry leonard shelter 
manager at the humane society 
what started off as a very typical service academy prank got 
out of hand wallace said it was a very unfortunate incident 
committed by a cheerleader who was caught up in the emotion of what 
has become a very fierce interservice rivalry 
the chickens were released on the field by west point cadets 
during halftime events before 52000 spectators both are alive 
and scratching around the back yard of the academys game warden 
until a home can be found for them wallace said 
academy officials would not release the cadets name because the 
incident did not result in criminal charges

the army has captured a ring of moslem 
fundamentalists in the occupied gaza strip who are believed to have 
kidnapped and killed two israeli soldiers the military announced 
today 
the body of one victim was never found but an army statement 
said interrogation of the suspects yielded the first concrete 
evidence that the soldier reported missing in may was slain after 
being abducted 
the trooper 18yearold ilan saadon of the mediterranean 
coastal town of ashkelon would be the 41st israeli slain in the 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of the gaza strip 
and west bank at least 612 arabs have been killed by israelis 
during the 22month revolt 
the latest death occurred today when riot police shot and 
killed a palestinian teenager in the west bank town of qalqilya 
the army said he was killed during a clash with stonethrowers 
arab reports said at least three other teenagers were wounded 
in the same protest 
also today the body of a 28yearold palestinian was found in 
the west bank town of nablus with multiple stab wounds arab 
reports said he was suspected of collaborating with israeli 
authorities 
the victim nabil samhan was the 142nd palestinian killed by 
fellow arabs during the uprising 
the army did not give the number of suspects arrested in the 
soldiers deaths it said the rings leader was among those 
detained it added that the three prime suspects have fled the 
country 
the statement said evidence gathered in the case has 
strengthened the belief that the soldier ilan saadon was kidnapped 
and killed as well similarly to avi sassportas and was buried 
somewhere in israeli territory 
saadon was last seen by a fellow soldier entering a white sedan 
in southern israel on may 3 
the suspects are also believed involved in the feb 16 
kidnapping and slaying of 21yearold soldier avi sassportas who 
disappeared while hitchhiking home his body was found may 7 in a 
grove near the gaza strip 
a police inquiry published today recommended that six policemen 
be fired and put under criminal investigation for the fatal 
shooting of an 18yearold palestinian in the west bank town of 
bethlehem on oct 26 
police spokesman uzi sandori said the recommendations for firing 
and investigating the six officers were given to national police 
commissioner david kraus who was reviewing them 
israel radio quoted the findings as saying the policemen are 
suspected of causing death fabricating evidence and giving false 
testimony 
the inquiry was launched after israeli newspapers quoted arab 
witnesses as saying the 18yearold palestinian was shot at 
pointblank range not during a car chase as police reported

conservative leader constantine mitsotakis 
received a mandate today to try to form a new government party 
officials said he faces a difficult time 
mitsotakis whose new democracy party won the most parliamentary 
seats in sundays elections but just missed a majority got the 
exploratory mandate from president christos sartzetakis 
mitsotakis has until friday to drum up enough support to 
persuade the president to let him go before parliament with the 
proposed government for a vote of confidence 
in three days i will return to the president and inform him of 
the results of my efforts mitsotakis told a news conference 
new democracy defeated andreas papandreous panhellenic 
socialist movement pasok in national elections for the second 
time in five months however it failed to win the 151 seats 
necessary for a parliamentary majority 
papandreou who governed greece from 1981 to the june elections 
will be given a chance to form a government if mitsotakis fails 
the former premier has 128 seats in the 300seat parliament 
compared to new democracys 148 
the thirdlargest party the communistled coalition of the left 
and progress has said it will not give the conservatives or the 
socialists its 21 seats 
three independents were also elected 
new democracy officials said they expected mitsotakis to have a 
tough time gathering enough support for a government especially 
since one of the independents was allied with the leftist parties 
mitsotakis said he will not enter any alliance that will force 
his party to water down its program to revive the economy and seek 
closer us ties 
a continued deadlock among the parties could lead to a third set 
of elections this year the conservatives were not enthusiastic 
about the possibility 
i dont see new elections right now for the simple reason 
that no one of the parties wants them nor do the greek people 
only in the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections 
said ioannis palaiokrassas a senior new democracy member 
if all three main parties fail to form a government the 
president will invite them to put together a joint administration 
the leftist coalition supports a government of all three parties 
new democracy and the coalition formed an alliance after the 
inconclusive june poll that alliance was dedicated solely to 
investigating papandreou and former ministers in his 
administration it resigned in october shortly after the former 
premier and five of his ministers were indicted by parliament 
another set of elections would not necessarily produce a strong 
government the proportional electoral system introduced by pasok 
before the june elections makes it very difficult for any party to 
win a parliamentary majority

democrat david dinkins entered the voting booth 
today with a big lead in opinion polls but with mayoral rival 
rudolph giuliani snapping at his heels with allegations of 
financial irregularities 
i hope we prevail of course said dinkins who has accused 
the republican of running a negative campaign 
giuliani emerged with confidence after casting his ballot 
todays election will decide the successor to democrat ed koch 
the outspoken symbol of the city for 12 years koch stopped off at 
a police precinct before voting to say goodbye to the cops 
should giuliani the former federal prosecutor pull off an 
upset he would become the citys first gop mayor elected since 
john lindsay in 1965 dinkins the manhattan borough president 
would be the citys first black mayor 
a weekend poll of 3010 likely voters by wnywtv and the gallup 
organization showed dinkins leading 56 percent to 42 percent 
dinkins backers planned a massive getoutthevote effort 
using 12000 volunteers workers staffing a 600line phone bank 
were encouraging 300000 supporters to vote and more than 100 sound 
trucks were being deployed 
more than 60 percent of the citys nearly 32 million voters 
were expected to turn out democrats outnumber republicans by 51 
the candidates spent monday in familiar poses dinkins 
surrounded by prominent democrats like koch whom he defeated in 
septembers primary gov mario cuomo and sen daniel patrick 
moynihan speaking of unity and tolerance 
giuliani surrounded by supportive police officers sharply 
questioned dinkins financial dealings 
so many serious questions have been raised about my opponent 
that this election has become a referendum on integrity giuliani 
said in a speech downtown 
giuliani was referring to alleged financial transgressions 
including dinkins admitted failure to pay taxes 20 years ago and 
the payment of 9500 to an exconvict to get out the vote in the 
primary he sold cabletelevision stock he once valued at 1 
million to his son for 58000 
david dinkins has a history of getting away with things that 
others dont get away with giuliani said 
the latest allegation was that dinkins failed to list on 
financial disclosure or tax forms that a friend paid in part for a 
trip to france last year 
dinkins said it is unclear whether such a gift must be listed on 
financial disclosure forms but added he would amend his statement 
anyway in order to provide the fullest possible disclosure 
he dismissed the accusation as desperate and called on 
supporters to reject the scurrilous politics of divide and 
conquer 
weve rejected the negative politics of slam and slander and 
stayed on the high ground of substantive dialogue and moral 
leadership dinkins told cheering supporters at a rally 
giuliani who has never held elective office projected himself 
as an outsider who can clean up a scandalscarred municipal 
government and portrayed dinkins as a product of democratic 
clubhouse politics 
i enter city hall with no strings no deals no ethical or 
legal problems that will envelop my administration giuliani said

former president carter says president bush is 
delaying too long in responding to the initiatives of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the rebirth of democracy in 
eastern europe 
we have got to get our act together carter said on monday 
in the strongest criticism he has offered to date on bushs 
performance in office 
bush today dismissed such criticism although he made no direct 
reference to carter 
at a white house news conference the president challenged 
critics to come up with specific ideas other than triple the 
spending on aid to poland and hungary 
bush said contrary to the basis of one question that leaders 
in western europe dont seem to agree with some of the poltical 
criticism he gets in connection with his dealings with nations that 
have been in the soviet sphere since world war ii 
carter in washington for a reunion with the people who staffed 
his campaigns and administration told an audience there is 
substantial proof that at least in some areas gorbachev is 
producing irreversible change in the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
the response of the bush administration doesnt match what 
gorbachev is doing carter said 
i think we are delaying too long in responding effectively to 
this change that is occurring carter said during a seminar 
sponsored by the center for national policy on the subject of 
waging peace 
in the absence of us leadership in eastern europe a policy 
vacuum occurs that cannot be filled by the leaders of britain 
france west germany or any other nation carter said 
the spokesman for the western world has got to be the 
president of the united states carter said i think we need to 
be able to respond to gorbachev because he is winning a tremendous 
propaganda victory in all of the many countries i have visited 
walter f mondale who served as carters vice president and who 
himself sought the presidency echoed carters complaints 
i think now is the time to strike mondale said i think 
the circumstances are such that we need a much more rapid us 
policy response 
they speak to us in eastern europe of the joy of democracy and 
freedom mondale said we sort of come back in the language of 
bookkeepers and bureaucrats 
robert m kimmitt undersecretary of state for political 
affairs another participant in the seminar said the united states 
does have to encourage and respond vigorously to rapidly 
evolving events in eastern europe but the administration is 
looking for elements of irreversibility in gorbachevs policies 
carter called gorbachevs rise to power one of the 
transforming political developments of our lifetime citing the 
soviet withdrawal from afghanistan soviet encouragement of the 
vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia gorbachevs arms control 
initiatives and willingness to permit independent policies in 
warsaw pact nations 
its hard to find fault with what he says carter said of 
gorbachev in some cases there is substantial proof he means what 
he says 
the former president also challenged bush to more closely engage 
the united states in pursuing peace in the middle east 
he said bush must make it clear he intends to vigorously pursue 
a peace agreement with all the means at his disposal and will not 
withdraw until it is achieved 
using the resources of the carter presidential center in 
atlanta carter has monitored the electoral process in nicaragua 
he said he wants to make it extremely difficult impossible 
for either party to withdraw from the election when one side or the 
other discovers it is likely to lose 
once they get involved in a highly publicized peace effort 
its difficult for them to withdraw carter said it would be 
devastating for them in terms of their public relations 
carter said he believes nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
made a tragic and deplorable mistake last week when he 
announced cancellation of a ceasefire with the rebels 
but he said he does not believe ortegas action is going to 
interfere with the holding of an election 
and carter said he believes recent attacks by contra rebels 
across the honduran border into nicaragua have been aimed at 
disrupting the process of registering voters 
carter who was hailed by participants in the reunion for his

senate leaders today urged colleagues to stop 
using delaying tactics preventing final passage of a compromise 
plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to 425 
both majority leader george mitchell and republican leader bob 
dole called on any senators who plan to offer amendments to the 
proposal to come forward a few senators have indicated they might 
propose amendments and debate has been all but stopped because 
none has actually done so 
dole and mitchell said they hoped a final vote on the minimum 
wage could come today so the senate could concentrate on 
negotiations to raise the governments debt ceiling 
the possible amendments range from an attempt to revive 
president bushs call for a capital gains tax cut to technical 
changes in the minimumwage bill most are considered little more 
than attempts to delay final passage of the measure because of 
partisan disputes particularly those over capital gains and 
efforts to raise the governments debt limit 
this is of course a situation with which we in the senate 
have become all too familiar mitchell dmaine said of the 
delay 
it is important we finish minimum wage get some agreement to 
vote said dole rkan 
the minimumwage bill was among several president bush mentioned 
at a morning news conference at which he said congress was moving 
too slowly on his domestic agenda i urge the congress to move 
quickly on these proposals bush said 
senate debate began monday and only two senators spoke despite 
mitchells urging that any senators with amendments step forward 
during that debate sen edward m kennedy dmass praised 
bush for compromising with congress on the minimum wage sen orrin 
hatch rutah predicted easy passage of the measure but said it 
would hurt the economy 
the nineyear stalemate over the minimum wage is finally 
broken said kennedy we certainly welcome that change of 
attitude between the reagan administration and the bush 
administration 
the increase would be the first since the federal wage floor hit 
335 in 1981 
hatch said the increase would not help many working poor but 
would cause wage and price inflation 
every good and material that is sold in america is going to go 
up in cost hatch said i think that means were going to have 
some very difficult economic times in the future i hope im 
wrong 
kennedy countered by calling the planned increase a very small 
adjustment that still would leave minimumwage earners well 
behind price inflation since the last increase in 1981 
may we do everything in our power to make sure that the 
working poor never have to wait that long again kennedy said 
the proposal which also would create a subminimum for 
teenagers is the product of a deal struck a week ago between bush 
and congressional democrats 
the measure provides two 45cent increases one next april 1 and 
the other a year later 
it also allows employers to pay a lower wage to workers age 16 
to 19 with less than three months total job experience the 
subminimum could be paid for three additional months if the workers 
were in certified training programs the subminimum would be 335 
beginning next april 1 and rise to 361 on april 1 1991 the 
provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993

a fetus carried by an asian elephant for a 
record two years is probably dead say veterinarians at the san 
diego wild animal park 
the chances are essentially nil that she is carrying a live 
fetus but theres still an outside chance because she is 
healthy james oosterhuis park director of veterinary services 
said monday 
the average gestation period for asian elephants is 618 to 648 
days 
the pregnancy of 19yearold jean reached 725 days monday 
surpassing that of an asian elephant that went 720 days before 
giving birth at a german zoo 
veterinarians attempted an endoscopy on the pachyderm last week 
but the 5foot instrument for getting a glimpse of the fetus wasnt 
long enough park staffers located two longer instruments after 
more than a dozen phone calls but the endoscopy isnt needed 
immediately because jean appears healthy 
veterinarians had not decided whether to induce labor or allow 
nature to take its course they are concerned the fetus which 
weighs 185 to 200 pounds could pass an infection to its 2ton 
mother oosterhuis said 
if she were sick and the going got tough then we would have 
to deal with it immediately oosterhuis said

washn reduction yes 
q why did you commit to dan quayle so early for 92 youre 
thought to be such a cautious prudent man why did you shut off 
your options so early 
a because i thought that was the prudent and right thing to do 
q well all right are you saying that dan quayle is your 
choice right now but you 
a well im not saying im running 
q well 
a right now so weve got to get back to square one i mean 
that that one 
q are you 
a laughing im not saying whether i am or not so were 
getting way out ahead of the of the where reality is but i was 
asked the question and i answered it open straight 
q are you saying hes your choice right now but you leave your 
options open for 
a yeah no i said hes my choice period yeah name 
inaudible and then frank 
q when egon krenz first came to power in east germany you said 
it was way too early to say whether he represented more of the 
same which seemed to be your sense at the time or whether he 
represented the leading edge of further reform seeing the dramatic 
events unfold in east germany what is your conclusion about egon 
krenz his intentions and his direction 
a i think its still too early to sum it up entirely but some 
of what he has said about political reform is quite encouraging and 
really contradicts the very early i would say global assessment 
of the man in other words he the early predictions were that 
hes a hardliner in the mode of mr honecker and now some of what 
he is saying is quite different from that and mrs honeckers not 
there any more so youre seeing some changes laughter 
laughing youre seeing some changes 
q inaudible 
a well shes out as a minister and another minister and 
youre beginning to see changes that might might laughter 
what are you guys laughing at laughing a new order so its 
it look weve got to be this gets me back almost to helens 
question things are happening very fast the concerted opinion was 
that this was going to be another hardliner in the mode of mr 
honecker now theres some signs that thats not the case so we 
will watch that very carefully 
yeah lesley 
q if i may follow up mr president do you feel that things 
have now gone too far in east germany poland hungary the soviet 
union for the clock to be turned back for a tiananmen squaretype 
crackdown and do you feel any need to assist the west germans in 
all of this 
a well the west germans have not requested assistance and i 
am in very close touch with the federal chancellor and im most 
anxious to talk to him when he returns from his sixday visit to 
poland i talked to him just very recently as a matter of fact 
about what were doing and thats why i ive stated rather 
confidently that european leaders dont seem to agree when i 
answered helens question with some of the political criticism i 
get from capitol hill or elsewhere so i what was the first part 
q gone too far 
a oh no i dont think you can ever say gone too far i 
mean who predicted with certainty what would happen in tiananmen 
square but i think its gone too far to irreversibly i mean to 
set back these fledgling i d a no 
q well how committed are you why are you vetoing all of the 
other programs 
a because i cant in good conscience on this one suggest that 
taxpayers money ought to go to programs that compel abortion and 
hat has been the problem with the china program and therefore i 
cant do that 
q inaudible our money is 
a i cant do it and im sorry but i am not going to change 
that policy i am strongly in favor and always have been of 
family planning ive been out front for family planning for a long 
time and as a member of congress way back there but i simply 
cannot support and ive asked the congress not to try to make me 
change a policy where the aid people will tell you it supports 
compulsory abortion i am not going to do that 
q but the american money is 
a and theres other things in that bill that i dont like too 
lesley this this leveraging provision i mean should i be told 
by the congress that i cant go and ask other countries to support 
poland should i 
q i dont know about the leveraging 
a well i do and thats one of the things thats wrong with 
it so i am concerned now thats kind of a postirancontra 
thing theyre saying you cant go get money for certain things 
but in congress intervening in the presidents authority like this 
they are asking me to accept things that i am not going to accept 
more

president bush said today that he doesnt 
believe voters cast their ballots on the single issue of abortion 
nor is it the most important issue on his agenda 
i think our party is broad enough to contain differing views 
on this and i think the democratic party is bush told a white 
house news conference 
i dont believe most voters are single issue voters there is 
no evidence to support that none at all he said citing data by 
his campaign pollster robert teeter showing the issue of abortion 
ranked between ninth and 14th on the list of what voters consider 
most important 
bush said he had no intention of changing my position on 
abortion 
the president opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest 
or endangerment to the mothers life he opposes federal money to 
fund abortions for poor women 
abortion divides said bush acknowledging the volatile 
atmosphere on abortion since the supreme court gave states 
increased power to restrict it this year 
is it the most important issue for me absolutely not he 
said 
bush recently vetoed a 1576 billion funding package for the 
departments of education labor and health and human services 
because of abortionfunding provisions 
its just so personal he said i just come down more on 
the side of life i dont fault people who view this 
differently theres plenty of room for difference

a european satellite launched aug 8 has recovered 
from an early failure of its booster and has been reprogrammed to 
provide accurate measurements of 100000 stars the european space 
agency said tuesday 
named hipparcos after an ancient greek astronomer the satellite 
failed to reach its planned geostationary orbit and has had to 
undergo a complex revision of its mission involving ground stations 
in french guyana west germany and australia 
the further use of a us ground station is being contemplated 
bringing the satellites coverage to about 93 percent of the area 
originally planned 
the life of the satellite in its revised orbit is likely to be 
limited by the reduction of electricity generated by its solar 
cells the agency said 
the agency said it would give an evaluation of hipparcos 
performance next year

l douglas wilder of virginia the grandson of slaves bid to 
become the nations first elected black governor tuesday and 
fellow democrat david dinkins sought triumph as new york citys 
first black mayor in offyear elections enlivened by the 
combustible mix of race and abortion 
rep james florio was the heavy favorite to defeat rep james 
courter in the new jersey governors race and reclaim the office 
for the democrats after eight years of republican control 
in the sole congressional seat on the ballot 11 candidates vied 
to fill out the term of the late rep mickey leland of texas 
killed in a plane crash last summer in ethiopia 
wilder his states lieutenant governor battled former attorney 
general j marshall coleman in a contest in the old capital of the 
confederacy that focused more on abortion than race 
dinkins the 62yearold manhattan borough president ran as the 
man who could bring racial harmony to the big apple rudolph 
giuliani 45 and a former us attorney making his first try for 
elective office hammered away at his rivals transfer of stock to 
a son and his failure to file incometax returns for four years two 
decades ago 
bigcity mayors on the ballot included coleman young in detroit 
and kathy whitmire in houston each seeking their fifth term don 
fraser in minneapolis seeking his fourth and xavier suarez in 
miami going after his third 
cleveland picked a new black mayor choosing between city 
council president george forbes and state sen michael r white in 
a particularly bitter race forbes called his rival a slumlord 
white said his opponent was a master of sleaze 
democrat john daniels was heavily favored to become the first 
black mayor in majoritywhite new haven conn 
in seattle city councilman norm rice battled opponent doug 
jewett in his drive for a similar distinction 
ben nichols a socialist was favored to win election as mayor 
of ithaca ny 
michigan decided the fate of two competing plans to raise the 
state sales tax for education one calling for a halfpenny 
increase and the other a twocent rise 
the maine ballot included an advisory measure to ban cruise 
missile testing in the state while san francisco in danger of 
losing its giants baseball franchise decided whether to build a 
new 115 million stadium to replace candlestick park 
president bush campaigned for gop candidates in virginia new 
jersey and new york in an election season that served as prelude to 
1990 when 34 senate seats 36 governorships and all 435 house 
seats will be on the ballot 
but just as republicans and democrats watched the returns for 
signs of partisan success so too was the year marked by interest 
in abortion and race with a heavy dose of negative campaign 
commercials thrown in 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the elections were closely watched for clues to shifting voter 
sentiment on abortion in the wake of the supreme courts ruling 
last summer that permits states to restrict the rights of women 
seeking to end their pregnancies 
bush in a news conference marking the first anniversary of his 
own election minimized the importance of abortion in this years 
campaign and said people are not for the most part singleissue 
voters they care about war and peace they care about the 
environment 
even so the issue played a role in new jersey and new york and 
particularly in virginia where prochoice and prolife groups 
bought television commercials to boost wilder and coleman 
respectively 
in all three races republican candidates were thrown on the 
defensive by their prochoice opponents 
wilder made the issue the cornerstone of his candidacy running 
television commercials in october that accused coleman of wanting 
to take away your right to choose and give it to the 
politicians even on abortions in cases of incest and rape 
his campaign challenged a decade of conventional political 
wisdom which held that abortion was an issue best ignored by a 
prochoice candidate and best exploited by one with righttolife 
views 
courter and giuliani both softened their original prolife 
positions as the campaigns wore on 
the issue of race was largely silent in virginia until the final 
days when coleman suggested his rival had been the beneficiary of 
a double standard in press coverage wilders rebuttal 
campaigning on saturday with a woman who said she was originally a 
coleman supporter but changed her mind after his comments 
the current governor democrat gerald l baliles is barred by 
state law from seeking a second consecutive term 
the new york race was to succeed threeterm mayor ed koch 
dinkins defeated the outgoing mayor in a primary in which he 
depicted himself as the man capable of calming the racial 
antagonism that often flares in the city 
giuliani who established a natiional reputation as a prosecutor 
of whitecollar criminals said dinkins needed to be investigated 
for his failure to pay income taxes and for allegedly covering up 
the details of a stock tranfer to his son 
i dont want someone voting for me because i am white he 
said i dont think thats right and i think the same thing is 
true of my opponent no one should vote for him because hes 
black 
dinkins replied i ask that nobody vote for me because i an 
africanamerican but i ask as well that nobody vote against me 
because i am an africanamerican 
the new jersey race was between two men who couldnt have been 
less alike 
florio the liberal democrat lost a gubernatorial primary in 
1977 and came within 1700 votes of winning the governors job in 
1981 the man who beat him thomas kean is stepping down after two 
terms as required by the state constitution 
courter a conservative republican was making his first try for 
statewide office 
their race was nasty for weeks 
florio struck with campaign commercials in october that showed 
courters nose growing longer and longer as a narrator ticked off a 
series of alleged lies and misleading statements 
courter lashed back with a variation on the same theme the 
faces of the two men side by side florios nose growing longer and 
longer and his own shorter and shorter

washn to accept 
q may i follow up on the abortion 
a how many followups do you get laughter 
q this is my followup in the china family planning program 
the american money would not have anything to do with abortion and 
also in the dc bill that you vetoed the federal money would not 
go to abortion you seem to be saying you want to affect the policy 
beyond the federal role 
awell look there are many issues and abortion divides we 
have room in our party for people that feel one way prolife or 
prochoice the democratic party is the same way i think everyone 
knows that this is an issue that divides but you say is it the 
most important issue for me absolutely not 
yes 
q youre probably ready for this one but you campaigned as an 
environmentalist and said you were a strong environmentalist yet 
on the issue of global warming it seems that the us is being 
dragged kicking and screaming into trying to address this problem 
how do you respond to that 
a i respond to it by saying its not true 
q why are you resisting the moves in this international 
conference now 
a were just standing off against extremes we have a unanimous 
communique out of that global conference we have an outstanding 
environmentalist in bill reilly we have an outstanding scientist 
in dr bromley they agree that our approach to all of this is 
right and i think we cannot be this policy of the environment 
cannot be driven by the extremes but i would like to take your 
question to challenge the united states congress to go forward on 
the revisions to the clean air act on other initiatives that we 
have supported instead of sitting back there and carping about it 
and if they dont like our way go ahead and try it and then add to 
it in later years but they sit there and argue back and forth with 
each other and nothing happens 
in this global conference i can tell you united states science 
is the best in terms of global warming and we will be in the lead 
as we are now with our science on global warming but you cant 
take a policy and drive it to the extreme and say to every country 
around the world you arent going to grow at all weve got to 
use our science to help solve this problem 
yes back there these two in the middle 
q mr president the gubernatorial campaigns as you know in 
new jersey and virginia were dominated by the abortion issue some 
prochoice republicans are disturbed with your current position 
what advice are you going to give republicans legislators and 
congressional candidates next year when the democrats start 
pounding on them on this issue 
a well theyve already started those who favor favor the 
prochoice have already started pounding on them and started 
certainly pounding on me but you see one i think our party is 
broad enough to contain differing views on this secondly and i 
think the democratic party is you see that you see that out there 
in practice 
secondly i dont believe that most voters are single issue 
voters there is no evidence to support that none at all indeed 
i hate to talk about polls because i dont believe them when i see 
ugly things but i can tell you that that issue ranks about 9th to 
14th if you talk to a pollster like bob teeter i cant remember 
whether it was 14th or 9th so im giving you a range there but 
people are not for the most part single issue voters they care 
about war and peace they care about the environment they care 
about education they care about antinarcotics they care about 
crime in their neighborhoods so when you see all this attention to 
this question i happen to think its those that are 
editorializing the columnists or some in the political arena that 
think the voter is a oneissue voter i dont agree with that and 
ive seen no evidence 
q but if republicans cling to the hope that you might change 
your position are they wrong that youre going to 
a i have no intention of changing my position its its so 
personal its so um i just come down more on the side of life 
i mentioned in my speech last year at the a yearplus ago of 
adoption and what its meant and but i look i dont fault 
people that view this differently as i say theres a plenty of 
room for difference but its not one john where people are as 
singleissue as you would as some would like to believe 
yes ellen 
q mr president your predecessor ronald reagan just came 
back from a trip to japan where he collected 2 million for his 
speaking engagements eventually youre going to be an 
expresident is that the kind of behavior that you anticipate 
yourself endorsing laughter accepting that kind of money 
a i will not have anything negative to say about president 
reagan if thats an invitation for this because i prefer to 
emphasize the positive positive parts of that trip talking 
openly about the need for freer trade the affection shown to him 
by the japanese people its important symbolism when it comes to 
the when it comes to this relationship that sometimes has strain 
and what happens in the future i dont know 
yes 
q excuse me a follow up sir

the church of englands general synod voted 
tuesday in favor of the principle of women priests the first step 
toward the possible ordination of women by the state church 
on the first day of a twoday debate members of the general 
synod passed by a simple majority the first clause of a proposed 
amendement to canon law to permit the ordination of women 
the change was supported by all three branches of the synod the 
churchs parliament the bishops voted 3017 in favor the clergy 
14985 in favor and the lay members 14478 in favor 
the issue of womens ordination now goes to the 43 dioceses for 
discussion by ordinary members of the church this is expected to 
start next year 
it is unlikely the question of ordaining women will return to 
the general synod for a final vote until 1992 when it will require 
a twothirds majority 
some of the loudest applause during debate was given to the 
bishop of durham the right rev david jenkins who said 
ordination of women to the priesthood is not the end of the 
world if the church of englands making a mistake were the end of 
the world the world would have ended long ago 
the bishop of portsmouth the right rev timothy bavin said he 
would have to consider resigning if the legislation was finally 
passed despite being a supporter of women priests he said he did 
not want to have to choose between favoring opponents or supporters 
among his congregations 
about 1200 women have been ordained in anglican churches 
mainly in the united states canada and new zealand the ordination 
of women has been a major point of contention between anglicans and 
roman catholics in their ecumenical encounters 
the church of england has been debating the issue for two 
decades and some opponents among the clergy and laity have said 
they will break away if women are ordained 
the clause approved by the synod reads it shall be lawful for 
the general synod to make provision by canon church law for 
enabling a woman to be ordained to the office of priest if she 
otherwise satisfies the requirements of canon law as to the persons 
who may be ordained as priests 
nothing in this measure shall make it lawful for a woman to be 
consecrated to the office of bishop 
at the start of the debate archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie said he would vote to allow discussions on the ordination of 
women to proceed in the dioceses despite remaining undecided on 
the basic principle of women priests 
i judge that the dioceses may surprise us by what they bring 
forward he said

president bush said today he is willing to 
meet with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir so long as the two 
sides have something positive to talk about on the us pln for 
mideast talks 
bush said he didnt know if or when shamir intends to visit 
washington but he is certainly willing to consider a meeting 
israel has given its qualified acceptance of the proposal by 
secretary of state james a baker iii for talks between israelis 
and palestinians 
israel is asking for a halfdozen assurances including a us 
promise to quit the talks if israel walks out bush officials are 
now looking for word from egypt and the palestine liberation 
organization on their stands 
bush said shamir is making a real effort to support the 
baker plan as for a meeting he said id like to feel that 
it would be constructive that wed have something positive to talk 
about 
under the baker plan talks between the israelis and the 
palestinians are supposed to set the stage for an election on the 
west bank and in gaza the palestinians elected in the territories 
would negotiate five years of limited selfrule with the israeli 
government 
there is still much to do and many details to be worked out 
before it would be possible to put together a preelection 
dialogue state department spokesman richard boucher said for 
now we look forward to receiving an egyptian response 
egypts role is to convey the position of the palestine 
liberation organization without plo acquiescence palestinians on 
the west bank and in gaza are unlikely to participate in shamirs 
election plan 
boucher said israels acceptance of the us plan was a very 
positive step a clear step forward 
but yossi ahimeir a spokesman for shamir said after the 
cabinet action that without the assurances we will not enter into 
these talks 
the israeli demands include exclusion of the plo and all of its 
members from the deliberations 
boucher and other us officials did not close the door on the 
israeli demands referring to them as assumptions he said 
we know that both israel and egypt are likely to request 
certain clarifications or understandings about the process we have 
made clear to both sides that were prepared to discuss these 
issues

wash follow up sir 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a follow up i dont know this line do you want to take 
q this is an invitation sir to ask your opinion of former 
presidents being paid by private industry once theyre out of 
office 
a i have no problem with that provided its not overdone 
q id like to return to 
a everybodys got to make a living laughter 
q vice president quayle for a minute on sunday the vice 
president said that the soviets retain expansionistic attitudes in 
central america afghanistan and several other parts of the world 
he suggested that gorbachev was a stalinist and also suggested 
that the soviet defense budget is growing while ours is declining 
do you agree with those three assessments 
a that their defense budget is growing yeah 
q and that gorbachev 
a id like to see them find a way to reverse that and out of 
the challenge that lies ahead to both gorbachev and me perhaps 
there will be a way to reverse it one way to do that i think is 
through prudent arms control the best way to do it is to do it 
through success in the conventional force in europe talks the cfe 
talks because thats where thats dollarintensive or 
rubleintensive if you will 
q the other two points mr president 
a what were they 
q that the soviets are expansionist in central america 
afghanistan cambodia and other parts of the world and this is a 
problem in our improving relations with the soviets 
a well ive long been concerned and as i think i said when i 
announced the gorbachev meeting concerned about some of these 
regional issues and i think well have a real opportunity to 
discuss the soviet role in you know aid for nicaragua the one 
country well not the one but one of the few thats swimming 
against the democratic tide here and it does not help ussoviet 
relations to have enormous expenditures supporting a dictatorship 
the sandinista dictatorship so i think theres plenty of room for 
discussion there and i look forward to talking to the soviet 
leader just as president reagan did but now we know its a little 
clearer the election process coming forward and i want to see the 
election process succeed 
q well my question goes 
a where are your questions going 
scattered laughter 
q is the soviet union continuing to be expansionist around the 
world 
a well ive told you ive got concerns about certain areas 
just as theyve raised concerns with us on certain things yes im 
concerned about continued support of soviet weapons or soviet 
support i want to be careful because the question of weapons is 
slightly complicated by how they get there and whether theyre 
coming out of cuba and have long been in cuban hands i mean there 
are some problems there but i think look to suggest the 
contrawise of that and that there are no problems that exist 
between us that everything is hunkydory simply is not reality 
and thats one of the reasons im looking forward to this visit 
yes 
q mr president when youre bobbing around in the 
mediterranean next month if gorbachev should ask you to show 
forbearance in the event he cracks down domestically or in the 
event he feels it necessary to support a crackdown in eastern 
europe how will you respond 
a im not going to buy into that hypothetical question 
yes 
q mr president youve had a report yesterday on the powmia 
issue i wonder if you can give us some specifics about what 
general vessey is accomplishing over there with regard to remains 
coming back and when how many more when well see them and also 
is there any information at all about people alive over there 
a no information at all about that a new openness according 
to general vessey on the part of the vietnamese leaders a new 
spirit a steppedup spirit of cooperation in terms of accounting 
for remains theyre pointing out to him that they are confident 
that there are no government holding facilities for remains that 
maybe had existed in the past pointing out to him that some 
families even might be holding remains some you know 
individuals in vietnam hoping for some sort of gain if people are 
sending putting bounty on these things or rewards out there and 
but i think the bottom line is he felt a he was quite 
encouraging about the kind of cooperation he was receiving he also 
relayed to me what i think all of us know that vietnam keeps 
sending signals that they want improved relations

the supreme court was told today that jailing 
a parent for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of a child who 
may be abused or even dead is a necessary penalty to enforce 
societys duty to protect defenseless children 
where will we be if the state cannot enforce such orders 
asked assistant attorney general ralph s tyler of maryland will 
the most effective remedy for assuring childrens safety be taken 
away 
the court in the case of a baltimore woman jailed for refusing 
to say where her son is engaged in a spirited onehour discussion 
of the rights of children and constitutional safeguards against 
selfincrimination 
tyler argued that jacqueline bouknight in jail for more than 18 
months for refusing to disclose her sons whereabouts is not being 
denied her rights against selfincrimination protected by the fifth 
amendment 
allowing the fifth amendment to outweigh the childs welfare 
could hamstring juvenile courts tyler said 
she has never claimed she cannot comply with the order but 
that she need not comply tyler said that is a dangerous 
extension of the fifth amendment 
but bouknights lawyer george e burns said the authorities 
have another alternative to jailing the parent indefinitely for 
contempt of court 
she could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries a 
threeyear prison term he said 
its not true that the state can do nothing burns said 
its not a matter of we cant do it we just wont do it 
child welfare groups and numerous state and local officials 
joined in urging the court to uphold bouknights indefinite jailing 
the mothers interest in avoiding any possibility of 
selfincrimination simply does not outweigh the states interest 
and its obligation to protect the child said a coalition of 
groups representing gorvernors mayors and other officials 
the groups include the us conference of mayors and the 
national governors association 
social workers last saw bouknights son maurice in september 
1987 when he was 11 months old they fear he may be dead 
maurice was admitted to a baltimore hospital on jan 23 1987 
when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg and 
other injuries 
suspecting the infant had been abused social workers put 
maurice in foster care and later obtained a court order giving the 
city protective custody of him 
city officials said bouknight suffered from emotional problems 
and was observed throwing maurice into his crib during the infants 
hospitalization 
maurice was returned to his mothers custody on july 17 1987 
after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo 
training in parenting skills 
but nine months later the social workers said bouknight no 
longer was cooperating with them moreover they said maurices 
father recently had been shot to death and bouknight was using 
drugs 
the mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on april 28 
1988 after she refused to disclose maurices whereabouts 
the maryland court of appeals ruled in december that jailing her 
for refusing to disclose the information violates her 
constitutional protection against selfincrimination 
but chief justice william h rehnquist suspended the effect of 
that ruling and prevented her from going free while the supreme 
court reviewed the case 
some have compared the bouknight case to that of elizabeth 
morgan who was released from prison on sept 25 the washington 
dc doctor was behind bars for more than two years for refusing 
to let her daughter visit the girls father morgans former 
husband 
morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl now 7 for 
courtordered visits with the father morgan accused her former 
husband of sexually abusing the child charges he consistently has 
denied 
among other groups supporting the contempt order against 
bouknight are advocates for children and youth the juvenile 
protective association and the criminal justice legal foundation 
the case is baltimore department of social services vs 
bouknight 881182

the nations roman catholic bishops today said 
no catholic can responsibly take a prochoice stand on abortion 
and they urged public officials to fight abortion 
the resolution was approved overwhelmingly on the second day of 
the fall meeting of the national conference of catholic bishops 
the 300 leaders of the nations 53 million roman catholics also 
elected archbishop daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati as president 
pilarczyk like his predecessor archbishop john may of st louis 
is a social and theological moderate 
the resolution on abortion said catholics should give urgent 
attention and priority to the issue in the wake of a us supreme 
court ruling in july giving states more authority to regulate the 
procedure 
an overwhelming number rose from their seats when those in favor 
of the resolution were asked to stand in a break from the usual 
practice however there was no request for a showing of those 
opposed to the resolution 
no catholic can responsibly take a prochoice stand when the 
choice involves the taking of innocent human life the 
resolution said 
we urge public officials especially catholics to advance 
these goals in recognition of their moral responsibility to protect 
the weak and defenseless among us 
the supreme court ruling in a missouri case provoked 
prochoice advocates to intensify efforts to defeat politicians 
who do not support permissive abortion the bishops statement 
said 
pilarczyk vice president of the conference since 1986 was 
elected on the first ballot to succeed archbishop john may of st 
louis also considered a moderate archbishop william h keeler of 
baltimore was elected vice president 
the 55yearold pilarczyk enjoys support among both the liberal 
and conservative camps of the bishops conference 
on monday the leaders of the church opened their meeting by 
plunging into the abortion debate and urging their flock to dig a 
little deeper to support church programs 
may issued a rallying cry against abortion in his opening 
address calling it an issue where clearcut moral principle 
stands tall above all else and comparing abortion to dropping a 
6monthold child in the baltimore harbor 
the leader of a catholic abortion rights groups called mays 
remarks simply cruel and unusual punishment to all women who 
have abortions but said she was not surprised by the bishops 
renewed vigor on abortion 
i think this meeting marks their reemergence as a political 
force on this issue said frances kissling president of 
catholics for a free choice in washington 
the bishops today also were to vote on a proposal to have laymen 
lead sunday services without priests the measure was prompted by a 
severe shortage of clergy 
in electing pilarczyk the conference held to a tradition in 
which no vice president who has sought the top spot has been turned 
down 
pilarczyk said in an interview that the most important social 
issues facing the church include the life issue of abortion and 
euthanasia and economic issues such as third world debt and the 
rights of unions 
the new conference president also said there is room for 
flexibility in seeking legislation that does not entirely conform 
to church teaching 
for example pilarczyk said if the question was whether he would 
support tolerating a law allowing abortion for rape and incest 
victims for the greater good of prohibiting other abortions the 
answer is probably yes 
pilarczyk was appointed auxiliary bishop of cincinnati in 1974 
and archbishop in 1982 after cardinal joseph bernardin left for the 
archdiocese of chicago 
with a study showing catholics contribute 40 percent less of 
their income than members of other churches the bishops on monday 
also ordered work to begin on a pastoral letter on church giving

a man who was a conscientious objector in the 
united states during the vietnam war has gone to jail in israel 
rather than serve his adopted country as a soldier in the occupied 
lands 
stephen langfur joined a small but growing number of israelis 
who refuse to serve in the west bank and gaza strip where a 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation began 23 months ago 
we have been watching the uprising on television and on the 
streets and he has been upset at what he has seen said his 
wife noga treves langfur when he came to the point where he 
couldnt stand seeing the way palestinians are being mistreated it 
was natural that he didnt want to take part in this 
langfur 48 was sent to a military prison nov 1 to serve 21 
days an army spokesman said he would not discuss specifics of the 
case and refused to permit an interview with langfur 
according to the army 72 men have been jailed for refusing duty 
in the west bank and gaza a support group for them called yesh 
gvul puts the total at 91 
we believe it is on the increase said yesh gvul director 
peretz kidron the army is very embarrassed by this of course 
and seems to be responding with a crackdown 
kidron said yesh gvul hebrew for there is a limit has 
found the army giving repeated sentences to men who refuse duty in 
the occupied territories he said one had spent more than 100 days 
in jail 
the army spokesman who would not let his name be used said the 
number refusing is very small compared with those who willingly 
serve in the lands israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war 
there have always been a few who refuse orders even when 
there is no war and we have a judicial system to deal with them 
he said 
newspapers say many reservists instead of refusing service in 
the west bank and gaza avoid it by making arrangements for other 
assignments the daily yediot ahronot said thousands had used that 
means 
israeli soldiers or settlers have killed at least 612 
palestinians since the uprising began dec 8 1987 and 142 have 
been killed by other palestinians most of them on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel forty israelis have died 
the regular army of 130000 is supplemented by 310000 
reservists like langfur who are called up each year for about 40 
days of active duty in israels last war the invasion and 
occupation of lebanon in 198285 about 160 soldiers were jailed 
for refusing service in the neighboring country 
langfurs decision was a natural outgrowth of his moral 
beliefs his wife said 
he was born in cedarhurst ny earned a doctorate in 
philosophy from syracuse university and taught at temple university 
in philadelphia and the university of houston 
in the 1960s during the vietnam war he won conscientious 
objector status on moral grounds mrs langfur said 
after moving to israel in 1979 langfur worked as a tour guide 
to support his family which now includes a daughter tali 11 and 
son benny 9 
he studied the history of israel closely and caught the sense 
of the miracle of the creation of the state his wife said he 
still has this feeling 
like most immigrants langfur completed military training and 
has done reserve duty within israel he was not called to lebanon 
and when orders came last month for duty in the territories he 
refused 
he feels and i feel that theres no way to peace but to come 
to some kind of terms with the palestinians mrs langfur said 
the way it is now cant go on

voters were given an unprecedented choice 
between two black candidates tuesday in an election to pick a 
successor to popular mayor george voinovich 
the two hopefuls city council president george forbes and his 
youthful former aide state sen michael white fought a bruising 
campaign that was notable as much for its nastiness as its 
historical significance 
forbes accused white of being a slumlord and of beating two 
former wives while white denounced forbes as a master of 
sleaze 
the nonpartisan race between the two democrats was made 
possible when voinovich decided to step aside to seek the 1990 
republican nomination for governor 
dayton toledo and youngstown were among the other ohio cities 
choosing mayors tuesday

clevelands first black mayor was carl stokes who won office in 
1967 stokes who served one term and subsequently became a 
municipal judge briefly considered running for mayor this year 
he didnt and forbes and white finished first and second in an 
oct 3 primary that included three white candidates in a city 
nearly evenly split between whites and blacks the two focused much 
of their campaigning on the citys predominantly white west side 
the fiveweek campaign epitomized clevelands bareknuckle style 
of politics white 38 who has been married three times defended 
himself against allegations by his first two wives that he beat 
them he also was put on the defensive when 200 city code 
violations were found in seven houses he owned 
forbes 59 defended himself against charges of ethical 
conflicts involving his city hall duties and his private law 
practice and brushed aside allegations that police and other city 
workers were defying the city charter by becoming personally 
involved in the campaign on his behalf

the united states is returning 567 million in 
frozen assets to iran a move president bush said today he hopes 
will prompt tehran to push for freedom for american hostages in 
lebanon 
but administration officials maintained that the transfer of 
money which has been held for nearly a decade was unrelated to 
the plight of the hostages held in lebanon by proiranian moslems 
the 567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by 
american banks against iran most of those claims were settled in 
the past few weeks 
as a result us officials said monday night the leftover 
assets will be returned to the bank of iran an additional 243 
million will be transferred to a special fund to back up other 
american claims against the persian gulf country 
bush speaking at a morning news conference said he didnt know 
what effect the money transfer would have on officials in iran 
but he added i hope that they will do what they can to 
influence those who hold these hostages he said he carries the 
fate of the hostages with me every single day 
referring to financial claims and counterclaims between the 
united states and iran the president said id like to get this 
underbrush cleaned out now 
while iran has made some positive statements recently he 
said the administration has so far run into dead ends in 
working behind the scenes to free the hostages in lebanon 
meanwhile former president jimmy carter said he also believes 
the time has come for the iranian assets to be unfrozen 
i dont think we ought to be fearful carter told reporters 
during a visit to senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
at the capitol 
it might lead ultimately to flexibility on the hostages 
carter said 
on a related issue bush condemned supporters of gen michel 
aoun the christian general who is opposed to a peace plan for 
lebanon ironed out by moslems and christians in the wartorn 
country aouns backers harrassed the catholic patriarch who backed 
the plan 
i am deeply offended by the aoun supporters who tried to 
humiliate the patriarch yesterday the president said i just 
hope that before i leave this job that i can in some way contribute 
to the question of peace in lebanon 
the move on the iranian assets followed talks in the hague last 
week between abraham sofaer the state departments legal adviser 
and iranian officials a special tribunal set up in the dutch 
capital in 1981 has been considering conflicting claims 
us officials said the decision to return the assets through 
the bank of iran was unrelated to the eight americans being held in 
lebanon by a proiranian faction 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani offered help last month in 
getting 18 western hostages freed if the united states released 
billions of dollars in frozen assets or helped settle the cases of 
three iranians captured by christian lebanese militiamen in 1982 
bush administration officials immediately responded they would 
not engage in negotiations over the hostages and called on 
humanitarian grounds for the release of all the hostages 
sondra mccarty a state department spokeswoman said sofaers 
talks with iranian officials in the hague last thursday and friday 
concerned only claims matters we are making no deals with anyone 
about the hostages she said 
about 800 million had been held in a special fund against 
claims of american banks since most of the bank claims were 
settled over the last several months 567 million could be 
returned to iran and the remainder was transferred to a special 
security account to back up other claims a us official said 
that account is maintained at a minimum of 500 million said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the usiranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part of 
the arrangement that led to the release of american hostages held 
for 444 days in tehran after seizure of the us embassy by 
militants 
there are several other claims issues outstanding including 
irans demand for compensation for military equipment purchased 
before the 1979 islamic revolution but never delivered 
the united states transferred 99 billion in frozen assets to 
the jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981 before the banks 
settlement some 38 billion had been transferred to iran 
the 810 million involved in mondays action had been reserved 
for us bank claims against iran

washn question laughter 
where did someone else go wrong 
weve been trying to cooperate in a bipartisan fashion i dont 
think i dont im look if i make a big mistake ill admit 
it but i dont think so when it comes to the approach to the 
budget weve got some honest differences on some things and maybe 
with george mitchell theres an honest difference on capital 
gains for example but we put that in our budget proposal it was 
in there with a certain revenue figure next to it i dont think i 
went wrong thats my responsibility 
heres what i believe and i think that there has been a little 
bit of a partisan shift that occurred up there when you hear them 
all come out with a rather unflattering word on the same day to 
describe my leadership you begin to wonder including the 
national chairman of the democratic party you begin to wonder 
what goes awry but lets leave aside the politics ill be ready 
come the fall of 1990 and lets move the legislative process 
forward 
q this was supposed to be groundwork for cooperation next 
years budget which was going to be the real tough one have we 
lost all hope of that now 
a well i think a lot on 91 depends on what happens you know 
in the last few days here what kinds of decisions are made 
q staying on the budget for a minute the pentagon feels it 
cant live with the consequences of a sequester apparently and 
youve issued a statement last week saying that youre prepared to 
manage the government under those circumstances as a person who 
campaigned as a candidate who would defend the pentagon and keep 
defenses strong how do you explain this to the people who 
supported you on the basis of 
a i tell them please get in touch with the congress and do what 
we suggested back there when we had that those meetings please 
help us keep the defenses of this country strong but if the if 
that is frustrated by the inability to get an acceptable 
reconciliation bill i have no choice and i think the pentagon 
leaders understand that 
we dick cheney has done a superb job he has fought with 
diminishing resources for a sound pentagon budget and it troubles 
me to have congress insensitive and also to add in i mean its 
tough look i know its tough to cut systems but you go to cut 
them and cheney makes some very tough decisions backed by the 
president and then the congress trades around and adds them back 
in and so its a question of you know staying with what we find 
is the priority for this defense program and trying to stay with 
it but ive got to live with the system also 
q mr president in the back 
q are you willing to meet with prime minister shamir when he 
comes to washington 
a uhhh whether hes coming or not im not sure certainly 
willing to consider it and he is giving i think theres a real 
effort now to work out support for the baker points the baker 
proposals and id like to feel that a meeting would be held and 
that it would be constructive that wed have something positive to 
talk about 
yes 
q mr president mr president last week you said in 
response to the nicaraguan decision to end the ceasefire that you 
would keep your options open and yet the best headcounters in 
fact most of the worst headcounters on the hill all say you 
dont have the option of new military aid to the contras so isnt 
that in effect a meaningless statement 
a well ill tell you no because i think one option now is 
to encourage in every way we can these talks that will result in a 
ceasefire i worry about what ortega has done the only good thing 
about it everybody sees that he is he is swimming against the 
tide and i think that its much clearer to some who in our 
hemisphere who are inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt 
but im not going to give up on hoping that they can get back to 
the status quo ante here 
q but you dont believe sir that you still have the option 
of renewing military aid to the contras do you 
more

all films made in the 1960s and 
banned after soviet tanks crushed the prague spring reforms in 
1968 will be shown in czechoslovakia the communist party newspaper 
said tuesday 
government cultural officials were quick to add however that 
the decision was not meant to rehabilitate the liberalization 
period 
the decision to ban the films was motivated especially by the 
needs of political consolidation after the years of crisis in 
196869 the party daily rude pravo said 
this decision however does not mean any kind of reversal in 
our distribution policy reappraisal of historical events or the 
films themselves rude pravo said 
during the 196os the czech wave of young filmmakers 
represented by milos forman and jiri menzel swept europe winning 
two oscars for closely observed trains and shop on main 
street 
after the sovietled invasion in august 1968 forman decided to 
live in the united states where he scored successes with one 
flew over the cuckoos nest and amadeus menzel fought a long 
battle with authorities at home 
this move is certainly a positive one albeit a little bit 
belated said jan foll a film historian and member of a 
commission which managed to lift the ban this summer 
this leaves the drawers clean there are no films banned 
anymore said alois humplik of the czechoslovak film distributing 
agency 
to many moviegoers in czechoslovakia the 1960s still represent 
the golden era of arts and culture film production has been 
received with much less enthusiasm in the last 20 years 
eleven of the old films will be shown in general distribution 
while 13 others will be shown in film clubs throughout the country 
the daily said 
among them will be the party and the guests directed by jan 
nemec and featuring zdena salivarova and writer josef skvorecky 
the decision will make it possible for a better and more 
objective determining of values inside and outside the times will 
strip them of the smell of cheap sensation and myth while 
contributing to an objective view on the rich and complex period of 
the sixties in our film said hviezdoslav stefan director of the 
czechoslovak film institute

city councilman norm rice seeking to become 
seattles first black mayor faced city attorney doug jewett on 
tuesday in an election dominated by an antibusing school

also on the ballot in municipal elections around washington 
state were races between tim strege and karen vialle for mayor of 
tacoma and sheri bernard and rob higgins for spokane mayor

early polls to a 5050 proposition a week before the election under 
a fierce attack from city state and school officials in this city 
of 500000 
the initiative asked but did not require the independently 
elected and selfbudgeting city school board to halt mandatory 
busing of students for racial balance in exchange about 43 
million to 45 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for 
magnet programs to attract a racial balance in school

royer in seattle rice trumpeted his democratic party credentials 
including endorsements from royer gov booth gardner the rev 
jesse jackson us rep jim mcdermott and virtually all of the 
citys state legislators 
jewett a maverick moderate who briefly supported former rep 
john anderson for president in 1980 and once tried to form a third 
political party downplayed his gop affiliation 
the two were allies in their first political forays with rice 
supporting jewett for election as the citys chief legal officer in 
1977 and jewett supporting rice for one of the nine city council 
seats the next year

congressional inaction on a bill raising the 
federal debt ceiling threatens the government with default on 
thursday for the first time in its history 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said after closeddoor 
meetings on monday that leaders are hoping to pass a new debt 
ceiling in time for president bush to sign it on wednesday 
we have decided to concentrate on extension of the debt 
ceiling while we are looking at other issues foley said after 
leaders tried to break the deadlock that has blocked passage of the 
higher debt ceiling and a big deficitreduction bill 
at a news conference today bush said he is prepared to let 
automatic spending cuts triggered oct 16 remain in effect unless 
congress approves a deficitreduction bill to his liking the 
automaticcuts processs is not easy but its real deficit 
reduction he said 
bush said he would sign an unamended bill that produces deficit 
reduction in the 14 billion range which is considerably more than 
congress and he agreed on last spring if its all loaded up with 
a lot of special projects i wont sign it he vowed 
the president said he is not about to give up on his cherished 
capitalgains tax cut which is stalled in the senate over the 
threat of a democratic filibuster the votes are there the house 
passed it a majority of the senate wants it he said 
one effect of the stalemate over the debt limit came monday when 
the treasury postponed its weekly bill auction then today it 
announced the postponement of 40 billion in debt auctions this 
week 
the postponement of these auctions is necessary because 
congress has not completed action on legislation to increase the 
statutory debt limit the treasury said 
the latest postponment involved auctions of 10 billion in 
threeyear notes today 10 billion in 10year notes on wednesday 
and 10 billion in 30year bonds on thursday in addition the 
treasury planned to sell 10 billion in 36day cash management 
bills on thursday 
the treasury had planned to offer 16 billion in three and 
sixmonth bills monday but postponed the sale because congress 
has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory 
debt limit 
the treasury lost further borrowing authority oct 31 when the 
debt limit reverted from 287 trillion to 28 trillion because 
it already has reached the lower limit the government faces 
default on some of its debt as early as thursday 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said last week that if 
congress fails to increase the limit by tuesday the government 
will run out of cash and default on nov 9 when about 138 
billion in treasury bills mature 
each day that congress fails to act however will cause 
additional disruption in our borrowing schedule possibly resulting 
in higher interest costs to the taxpayer brady said in a speech 
to maryland bankers 
to avoid these potential costs and the prospect of default 
immediate congressional action is imperative 
disagreement over several issues are holding up the legislation 
foley indicated one major issue to be resolved is whether 
legislation repealing or scaling back catastrophic health coverage 
for retirees should be attached to the debtceiling bill or 
considered as part of the deficitreduction package 
the house has passed a 31 trillion debt ceiling but action 
was stalled in the senate by republican demands that it be 
accompanied by a capital gains tax cut a top priority for bush 
the white house abandoned that effort last week and democratic 
and gop senate leaders were discussing legislation monday to 
increase the limit however any bill approved by the senate likely 
would differ from the house version and efforts to reach a 
compromise would require more time 
michael basham deputy assistant treasury secretary told 
reporters last week that plans for 40 billion in additional 
borrowing this week probably would have to be postponed if congress 
doesnt complete action on a new debt limit by tuesday 
these auctions include 10 billion in threeyear notes tuesday 
10 billion in 10year notes wednesday and 10 billion in 30year 
bonds thursday in addition the treasury plans to sell 10 billion 
in 36day cash management bills thursday 
lack of congressional action forced the treasury last wednesday 
to suspend new sales of us savings bonds and of special 
securities for state and local governments

the association of american colleges said 
tuesday that institutions of higher education can help alleviate a 
shortage of qualified teachers by more aggressively attracting 
undergraduates to the profession 
few institutions are trying seriously to recruit large numbers 
of more able students into teaching or provide them with more 
challenging and substantive programs said joseph johnston 
association vice president for programs 
more liberal arts majors could be recruited if colleges and 
universities combined undergraduate arts and science programs with 
education courses the association said 
education courses also should be added to the generaleducation 
curriculum which is usually taken in the first two years of 
college before the student declares a major the group said 
by adding an education course colleges and universities might 
recruit students who have not seriously considered teaching or who 
even have some aversion to it 
integrating noneducation courses with education training will 
produce bright broadly educated graduates with command both 
of the subjects to be taught and of the ways in which they can be 
taught effectively said johnston 
the suggestions in the association study those who can 
undergraduate programs to prepare arts and sciences majors for 
teaching differ from two influential 1986 studies by the 
carnegie corp of new yorks task force on teaching as a profession 
and by the holmes group 
the earlier studies recommended prospective teachers be required 
to earn an undergraduate degree in an academic discipline before 
undertaking professional training at the graduate level 
the department of education predicts the demand for new public 
school teachers will rise from 128000 in 1988 to 174000 in 1995 
only 88 percent of the 1988 firstyear students plan to pursue 
careers in elementary or secondary schools 
as recently as 1980 34 percent of new college graduates who 
were certified to teach had completed baccalaureate degrees in the 
arts and sciences by 1984 that number had fallen to 19 percent 
the report said 
johnston said the associations report supported by the 
rockefeller foundation is the result of a threeyear study that 
included a national survey of fouryear institutions with 
teachercertification programs for arts and sciences majors

washn do you 
a uhh it would be extremely difficult to get the money if 
thats what youre saying yeah 
yes 
q mr president nancy reagan says that you went to see her and 
said you agreed that don regan should leave as chief of staff but 
that when she asked you to go to president reagan you said that 
was not your role number one is that the way you remember it and 
number two now that quayle is vice president if he thought there 
was someone who was not serving you well do you agree that its 
not his role to come and tell you that 
a no i think its his role to tell me anything thats on his 
mind which is exactly the relationship i had with president reagan 
and thats the way i worked as vice president 
q mr president could you just answer the 
a no i cant help you on that i dont want to get into that 
one laughter laughs what was the next question why never 
mind laughter 
q mr president given that today is election day i wonder if 
youre satisfied with the level of political discourse you see if 
you think that this negativism thats being raised in one campaign 
after another is excessive and if you feel you can do anything 
about it yourself given that your last campaign was quite negative 
or critical if you prefer that word 
a i think everybody would prefer the positives what some 
consider negative others consider factual so you always have a 
judgmental problem there but im not sure there is much that a 
president can do about it in terms of i dont want to inhibit a 
candidate from taking his case to the people or her case to the 
people in any way he or she sees fit on the other hand i think 
the american people have a way of sorting out whats fair and 
whats not fair whats ugly and what isnt ugly and i have great 
confidence in that that theyre right this election day a year 
ago i think they sorted through some of these allegations that 
this was the ugliest dirtiest campaign and i think they voted on 
a more positive basis than that 
q mr president how coming off of kens question though 
how do you respond to those who suggest that the negative 
campaigning that started earlier in this campaign than usual is a 
legacy of 88 when it was shown to be successful 
a well i dont say anything started in 1988 that hadnt been 
taking place in 86 or 84 or 82 or 80 or so you know and if 
you look into history youre going to have certain things that are 
considered negative i dont have to stand here and defend the 
campaign of 1988 id be perfectly prepared to do it but i was 
elected i put confidence in the american people their ability to 
sort through what is fair and what is unfair what is ugly and what 
is unugly and be as positive as possible but while people were 
running around you know in campaigns talking about talking 
about ads this year the candidates have been out there taking 
their case on various various issues out there so i i think 
were i think theres a little bit of a beltway syndrome here in 
terms of this intense focus on negativism and yet if their trend 
is that way maybe i can have a role in seeing that it gets a 
little more positive 
q how would you do that 
a well say i think it ought to be a little more positive 
laughter i mean what else can you do im certainly not going 
to legislate it and certainly not going to try to dictate to a 
candidate how he or she you know reacts in a certain situation 
but there will be i suppose therell be a lot of interpretation 
on one candidate or another and well all go back to whether there 
needs some other way to approach this but when you get right down 
to it i do not want to see legislation try to get into this 
question it gets into a censorship mode that i just would feel 
very uncomfortable with 
ann and then ive got to go 
more

president bush in an electionanniversary 
news conference claimed a successful start for his presidency on 
tuesday and voiced hope that the return of 567 million in frozen 
assets to iran will eventually help lead to freedom for american 
hostages in lebanon 
the president said he would veto and exhort congress until 
he gets action on his legislative programs exclaiming what else 
can i do as he blamed democrat majorities in both house and 
senate for an impasse on reduing the federal deficit 
much of the session revolved around complicated foreign policy 
matters as bush dismissed criticism most recently from former 
president carter of his policies toward eastern europe he said 
the administration is dealing properly with the tumultuous changes 
there and that his opponents just want to spend more money on aid 
bush returned to the podium after ending the televised news 
conference to rebuke militant christians in lebanon for grabbing a 
catholic patriarch at his home and manhandling him for endorsing a 
compromise political accord 
he said that behavior was totally out of order and urged 
that all foreign forces be withdrawn from lebanon and warring 
factors be reconciled 
the president said the release of iranian funds might get 
underbrush cleaned out 
i carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day 
bush told reporters he said he knew of no reason to be encouraged 
at this time however on an issue that has bedeviled his 
predecessors and complicated the first 10 months of his term 
bush arrived with a statement marking wednesdays anniversary of 
his election and saying weve had so far a successful first year 
in office 
i enjoy it i like the challenge he said of his 10 months 
in office 
later in response to a question about todays offyear 
elections bush said he hoped future campaigns would be a little 
more postive 
asked about the emergence of abortion as a critical issue in 
gubernatorial elections being held in virginia and new jersey bush 
asserted that issue ranks about 9th to 14th 
people are not for the most part singleissue voters bush 
said of an issue that often seemed to cut against republicans 
during the campaign period he added i have no intention of 
changing my position its so personal i just come down on the 
side of life 
bush recently vetoed two spending bills over a provision 
expanding the use of federal medicaid funds to pay for abortions 
for poor women in cases of rape or incest it supports compulsory 
abortion he said i am not going to do that 
currently such funds can be used only if the mothers life is 
in danger 
bush rejected criticism that he has failed to exert leadership 
in wordwide efforts to combat global warming he said he was not 
prepared to join some 60 nations meeting in the netherlands on a 
resolution to cap carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 saying 
such a move is too early and too extreme

democratic rep james florio who lost the 
closest governors race in new jersey history eight years ago 
entered tuesdays election confident he would reverse his fortunes 
and beat republican rep james courter in an unusually nasty 
contest 
election officials said voter turnout around the state ranged 
from moderate to heavy and was especially strong in florios home 
district of camden 
the race to succeed republican gov thomas h kean was courters 
first and florios third in the final weekend florio an 
eightterm congressman held a 24point lead in an independent poll 
that gave him a better than 2to1 advantage among independent 
voters 
as he grew increasingly confident of his lead florio devoted 
most of his campaign stops to key assembly districts where close 
battles were waged for control of the legislatures 80member lower 
house where the republicans held a 4139 margin 
at stake was control of the legislature which will control 
redrawing congressional districts after the 1990 census 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
florio 52 ran fourth in the 1977 democratic primary and lost 
the 1981 general election to kean by 1797 votes out of nearly 23 
million cast a margin of less than onetwelfth of 1 percent kean 
is barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term 
political observers said florio softened a brusque and aloof 
personality that hurt him in 1981 and ran a nearly flawless 
campaign that kept courter on the defensive courter 48 appeared 
troubled by internal disarray and stumbled on delicate issues such 
as abortion and homosexual rights 
abortion entered the campaign after the us supreme court 
ruling in july gave states more power to restrict abortions 
florio who once opposed abortion immediately condemned the 
erosion of abortion rights it took courter weeks to remold his 
longheld antiabortion stand and assure new jerseys largely 
prochoice electorate that he would not impose his personal views 
on voters 
each gubernatorial candidate spent 5 million the maximum 
permitted under the states public financing law most was spent on 
television commercials in the costly new york and philadelphia 
markets as the candidates exchanged charges over the environment 
corruption and taxes 
florio and then courter accused each other of repeatedly lying 
on the campaign trail both ran commercials showing their 
opponents nose growing like that of pinocchio 
florio who wrote the federal superfund cleanup law repeatedly 
attacked courters environmental record in congress and the 
republicans plan to cut premiums by deregulating the insurance 
industry to increase competition 
courter called for changes in new jerseys death penalty law and 
promised to fight for tough laws to combat illegal drugs florio 
said the current capital punishment law was adequate

china was very helpful because he was an unofficial visitor he is 
respected in china as a lao pengyou old friend he is the man 
who opened a relationship with china when things were 
extraordinarily difficult not just a lack of communication but go 
back to history and take a look at the you were in the last 
vestiges of the cultural revolution where you know many many 
many people hundreds of thousands reportedly lost their lives and 
so he went there at a difficult time he saw the fundamental 
importance of this relationship as i do he could speak quite 
frankly to the chinese leaders and they in turn spoke very 
frankly to him and i think he made the point that we didnt tie 
the knot now i think that helps 
because of the respect that the leaders in china have for 
president nixon i think that visit was very constructive he 
carried no messages from me he was not on a you know 
semiofficial mode or anything a mission or anything of that 
nature but i think i have a better feeling of where chinese 
leaders stand at this point because of having been debriefed by 
president nixon i wish there were some positive steps that i could 
suggest to them that they take 
there are some things that i will keep private that i have 
quietly recommended and well see where it goes but this 
relationship is important to us as those of you who know my views 
on this question i have never favored the concept of a card 
playing a soviet card playing a chinese card the relationship has 
to stand on its merits 
having said that there is enormous geopolitical reasons for us 
to have relations with the peoples republic of china and yet 
there is this affr convening those taif meetings and for the 
legislators to the legislators that are that attended the 
courage that they showed in going there and the quest for freedom 
i mean the quest for peace in that country was so you just 
feel it in what those legislators are hoping to accomplish 
and then along comes these followers that i would term totally 
out of order in going in there and trying to humiliate the maronite 
patriarch and it is just totally counterproductive and i i 
hope that we can find a way to build on the new election build on 
and syrian willingness to get out move those troops out 
withdraw all foreign forces from lebanon and im talking about all 
foreign forces reconciliation under president moawad and the 
reform implement the reforms that have been spoken to addressed 
in taif and therein lies a formulation for peace 
but youre talking to one who feels the question of lebanon all 
the time ive been there ive seen it as a peaceful crossroads in 
always troubled corner of the world and i just hope that before i 
leave this job that i can in some way contribute to the 
restoration of peace in the lebanon 
thank you all very much

attention focused on virginia new jersey and new york city 
today as voters decided the outcome of campaigns testing attitudes 
on race and abortion and trying the publics tolerance for negative 
appeals 
as candidates wound down their campaigns monday the emphasis was 
on voter turnout with democrats warning against overconfidence 
and republicans vowing to surprise pollsters who show them trailing 
democrats l douglas wilder and david dinkins were hoping to 
break race barriers wilder campaigning in virginia to become the 
first black elected governor of any state and dinkins bidding to 
become new york citys first black mayor 
in the new jersey governors race democratic rep james florio 
looked like a solid bet to defeat republican rep james courter 
turnout was described as moderate to heavy and especially strong 
in the camden area florios home district 
dinkins and his republican opponent rudolph giuliani voted 
early in new york city 
despite his lead in preelection polls dinkins declined to 
predict victory when he voted on upper riverside drive i hope we 
prevail of course said the democratic candidate giuliani said 
he was confident 
election officials said turnout was heavy in all parts of the 
city predicting that 60 percent to 65 percent of eligible voters 
would cast ballots 
early reports from virginia pointed to a heavy turnout were 
on roller skates said alice lynch the voter registrar in 
richmond it seems like a tremendous turnout i think its going 
to be a record in richmond anyway 
president bush asked at a white house news conference about the 
potential impact of the abortion issue on todays elections said 
people are not for the most part singleissue voters they care 
about war and peace they care about the environment 
bush dismissed suggestions that the negative tone this year is a 
legacy of his 1988 presidential campaign i dont have to stand 
here and defend the campaign of 1988 he said adding that the 
american people have a way of sorting out whats fair and whats 
not fair whats ugly and what isnt ugly 
the president said any role he might have in making campaigns 
a little more positive would be limited to persuasion youre 
certainly not going to legislate it he said 
preelection polls bolstered the democrats hopes in virginia 
and new york wilder had an edge over republican j marshall 
coleman while a new york poll said dinkins had a doubledigit lead 
over republican rudolph giuliani 
our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way said 
coleman all we have to do is get the vote out 
turnout is very important said wilder every democratic 
election here has to depend on turnout and hopefully it will be 
there 
while race wasnt raised directly in either contest both 
coleman and giuliani complained of a double standard implying 
their democratic opponents were being judged leniently because they 
are black 
david dinkins has a history of getting away with things that 
others dont get away with giuliani said monday as he insisted 
the election had become a referendum on integrity 
coleman took a similar tack in virginia last week 
voters also were choosing mayors and city council members in 
cities large and small as well as state legislators in virginia 
and new jersey 
the candidates included longterm incumbents like coleman young 
in detroit and kathy whitmire in houston socialist ben nichols was 
favored to win election as mayor of ithaca ny while norm rice 
in seattle and john daniels in new haven conn were bidding to 
become the first black mayors of their cities 
there were 56 propositions on ballots in 10 states giving 
voters a chance to decide on issues ranging from funding for 
education in michigan whether to build a new ballpark in san 
francisco smoking in greensboro nc and cruise missile testing 
in maine 
whichever party claimed the most victories from the sparse 
offyear lineup was sure to read the results as a harbinger of 
1990 although there was no sign of the emergence of any national 
issue other than abortion a volatile question whose longterm 
impact was far from clear 
president bush campaigned for republican candidates for governor 
in new jersey and virginia and for mayor of new york city but 
preelection polls gave democrats hope for a sweep of the three 
races and the chance to claim voters were rejecting the republican 
president along with the candidates he tried to help 
the campaigns were markedly nasty in tone with the candidates 
for governor of new jersey calling each other liars and rivals in 
virginia and new york questioning each others ethics there was 
slim hope any conceivable results could undermine candidates faith 
in the power of attack commercials 
while race was the question that focused attention on virginia 
early in the campaign wilder upset many expectations when he made 
his support for abortion rights a central theme of his campaign 
wilders stand caught coleman an opponent of legal abortions 
by surprise as the campaign progressed coleman conceded he was 
being hurt by the abortion issup 3874

new york timesman james reston sage of 
american journalism says he doesnt join those who wring their 
hands and ask where the giants of yesterday are he was around he 
says when the giants were hitler and stalin hes had enough of 
giants 
reston does wonder as he retires what happened to the idea 
that people in government were supposed to set the standards not 
just shrug off their misdeeds with an everbodydoesit 
hes not surprised that george bush is turning out to be a 
cautious president 
you get from george about what you see he says i know 
that family i lived up the street from his mother and father for 
10 years george is not the kind of guy to run a revolution but he 
wont do anything stupid 
reston does raise an eyebrow over the presidents weekend 
declaration that he would run again with dan quayle if he decides 
himself to seek reelection 
if presidents go on choosing people like dan quayle and 
telling us theyre the best available youre bound to have 
problems reston says 
after all he points out a country of two or three million 
produced mr jefferson and mr washington and ben franklin i 
cant believe were getting anything like the best people in 
government today 
reston retired friday on his 80th birthday half a century 
after he joined the times he is writing a book of memoirs 
hes an old sportswriter and fond of saying so he started for 
the springfield daily news in ohio in 1932 for 10 a week and 
was a publicity man for ohio state university in 1933 a traveling 
secretary for the cincinnati reds in 1934 and an associated press 
man in he recalls a rathole of a bureau in london from 1937 to 
1939 when the war was fomenting and the times hired him away 
he spent most of the rest of his life observing washington for 
34 years what restons column said was important to washington he 
did his own thinking took the long view was generally optimistic 
he retired without fanfare but shared some parting ideas in a 
telephone interview 
he doesnt think america suffers from a shortage of great men 
rather than a giant he likes people like harry truman they knew 
what they didnt know 
the presidents who have gotten in the most trouble in the last 
40 or 50 years are those who thought they could do everything on 
their own and thought they didnt need a state department and could 
run it out of the white house reston says 
look where the giants got us in the world stalin and hitler 
i think we can do without giants if we just get a lot of pretty 
smart guys around and argue it out weve got a better chance of 
coming out all right 
he would like to see a return to the idea that people in 
government are supposed to be the models who set the standards for 
personal conduct that idea has kind of gone by the boards for some 
reason or other now they say well everybody does it 
reston doesnt join ronald reagan in wishing the 22nd amendment 
could be erased from the constitution in his last year in office 
reagan often said he thought it was a mistake to limit presidents 
to two terms 
i dont like the idea of people being in power too long 
reston says they tend to get corrupted or lazy 
reagan ran downhill at the end of his second term even ike 
did and in england prime minster margaret thatcher after 10 
years in office is beginning to get a little schoolmistressish 
reston says newspapers are better than ever competition from 
broadcasting has forced them to do what they should report the 
causes and consequences of things not just the event itself 
he says it is healthy when people dont like newspapers 
were not cheerleaders he says its our business to 
carry the news the way the mailman carries the mail 
but he salutes the power of television to wring changes 
newspapers wrote about injustice to the blacks for years but the 
pictures of police turning their dogs on demonstrators made the 
difference 
if you had tv coverage the first and second world wars would 
have ended sooner he says 
television is whats forcing change in eastern europe and the 
soviet union people there see the rest of the world and begin to 
think its crazy that they have to line up for 10 hours to get a 
turnip 
but the revolution is just beginning he says it took a century 
and a civil war for america to accommodate to its states rights 
problems 
the soviet union is now running into states rights problems 
its going to take a long to resolve and if the russians can do it 
without a civil war theyll be very lucky

anticommunist marchers striking workers and 
clashes between police and protesters vied tuesday with a 
scaleddown military parade on red square as the soviet union 
celebrated the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
even president mikhail s gorbachev tempered the revolution day 
festivities by saying the nations economic problems hang like a 
sword of damocles over us 
a column of about 5000 marchers paraded peacefully through 
moscow to challenge communist party authority while a few miles 
away gorbachev and other leaders celebrated the 72nd anniversary 
of the revolution reviewing the traditional show of military force 
activists in the southwest republic of moldavia said police 
broke up a crowd of thousands of wouldbe protesters and beat some 
of them the military part of the parade in its capital kishinev 
was canceled 
in the arctic city of vorkuta striking coal miners joined the 
official celebration but carried slogans demanding more 
independence and that the government fulfill promises of better 
living and working conditions 
in some trouble spots such as the caucasus republics of armenia 
and georgia staterun media said traditional parades were 
canceled boris sokolov an activist from the baltic republic of 
latvia said a small group of people burned a red soviet flag in 
the center of riga the capital 
gorbachev interviewed by soviet tv atop lenins mausoleum in 
red square acknowledged that many soviets feel threatened by food 
shortages and the disorganization of the consumer market 
when all this is hanging like a sword of damocles over us it 
is very important we do not forget the main thing that this is the 
way we have chosen to follow he said referring to the greek 
legend in which a sword was strung by a single hair over the head 
of damocles a royal attendant to show the precariousness of power 
gorbachev said the soviet leadership has not yet been able to 
replace fully the administrative system of the past and thus 
there exists a loss or a weakening of control shall we go back 
that would be a mistake the greatest mistake 
the anniversary marks the day in 1917 when the bolsheviks under 
lenin seized power from a provisional government that had ruled for 
about eight months after czar nicholas ii abdicated 
those who marched more than four hours in the unofficial column 
made clear they believed the revolution had gotten them little but 
food shortages pollution and the kgb secret police 
were tired of 70 years of communist power with nothing having 
changed for the better and this is our protest said taisya 
shlyonova a retiree one placard characterized communist rule as 
72 years on the road to nowhere 
police supervised their route from northwest moscow to the 
citys olympic stadium less than two miles from red square where 
they held a rally organizers had reached an agreement with city 
officials not to head for red square and roads to the center were 
blocked by double lines of police in case they changed their mind 
grassroots groups marched in official parades in several soviet 
cities last year but this apparently was the first 
counterdemonstration of any size permitted on revolution day 
yuri rozhgo a spokesman for the moldavian peoples front 
organization said by telephone from kishinev the republics 
capital that police beat people in a crowd of thousands who 
gathered near a monument to national hero king stephen the great 
near the parade route before dawn 
he said more were beaten by police who dispersed a crowd of a 
couple of about 100 peoples front supporters on lenin prospekt 
officials canceled the military part of the parade but a 
demonstration of workers went off as scheduled following that 
rozhgo said thousands of peoples front supporters marched the 
parade route with slogans condemning the police and the republics 
leadership 
he did not know how many people were injured or detained by 
police but said that most of those detained were released within 
hours 
in vorkuta in the soviet arctic coal miners who have been on 
strike for two weeks joined the official celebration but with 
their own banners said city strike committee spokesman pavel 
belyaev 
the slogans called on the government to fulfill the promises it 
made in july to end a walkout criticized bureaucracy and demanded 
more independence 
strikers met on the eve of the holiday with coal ministry 
mikhail shchadov but did not agree to return to work belyaev said 
only regular maintenance was done at the striking mines tuesday 
and it was unclear when the strike would end 
in latvia where local peoples front organizations declared the 
bolshevik revolution was a coup that curtailed the countrys 
development of democracy the official latinform news agency 
reported no disturbances activists reported lvov a hotbed of 
ukrainian activists was quiet as well 
the parade on red square held under a leaden sky with 
temperatures just above freezing was more lowkey than in previous 
years 
no strategic missiles were in evidence the military part of the 
parade including more than 8000 soldiers sailors airmen and 
paratroopers a speech by defense minister dmitri t yazov a 
rumble of distant cannon fire and a show of military hardware took 
slightly more than 30 minutes 
the military hardware took only five minutes to rumble through 
the medieval square leaving behind clouds of smoke and the smell 
of diesel fuel 
a 90minute march of thousands of people carrying officially 
approved banners paper flowers and balloons followed 
several slogans demanded an end to extremism in the tense 
relations between soviet ethnic groups one poster protesting 
increasing prices showed a vacuum cleaner labeled prices 
sucking rubles away from a working man

turnout was heavy today as l douglas 
wilders bid to become the nations first elected black governor 
went to the voters after a race in which abortion and negative 
campaigning emerged as major issues 
were on roller skates said alice lynch registrar in 
richmond describing the activity in her office i think its 
going to be a record in richmond anyway 
wilder the states democratic lieutenant governor and j 
marshall coleman the republican candidate flew across the state 
monday to warn supporters against complacency and too much reliance 
on polls showing wilder ahead 
were absolutely on the eve of a great victory coleman told 
about two dozen volunteers at richmonds airport 
wilder pointing to an overcast and drizzling sky at a state 
capitol rally in the afternoon for about 100 supporters said 
everything was sunny its only in perception he said 
the weather was cloudy this morning 
campaign workers on both sides staffed telephone banks monday to 
call potential supporters and urge them to vote 
coleman a former attorney general spent the day with sen john 
w warner rva and was met in richmond by the republican 
candidate for attorney general joseph b benedetti the gop 
nominee for lieutenant governor edwina p eddy dalton was 
campaigning separately 
wilder and his running mates donald s beyer jr for lieutenant 
governor and mary sue terry seeking reelection as attorney 
general stayed together and were joined by gov gerald l baliles 
and former gov charles s robb now a us senator 
while race was the question that focused attention on virginia 
early in the campaign wilder upset many expectations when he made 
his support for abortion rights a central theme of his campaign 
wilders stand caught coleman an opponent of abortions by 
surprise as the campaign progressed coleman conceded he was being 
hurt by the abortion issue 
the campaign has gotten acrimonious at times 
the gop candidate has aired a commercial portraying his 
democratic opponent as insensitive to rape victims and wilder has 
inveighed against coleman for invoking the name of slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr in a televised debate because 
he said coleman urged a veto of a state holiday honoring king 
in roanoke on monday wilder said he felt exceedingly good 
about the chances for a democratic sweep of the states top three 
offices 
but he also played down a richmond timesdispatch poll on sunday 
showing him 9 points ahead of coleman 45 percent to 36 percent 
with 19 percent undecided 
coleman said he has the most effective grassroots organization 
in state history and that his workers were out to energize the 
precinct organization 
our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way 
coleman said all we have to do is get the vote out

struggling to cope with a flood 
of people from east germany and the east bloc the government 
tuesday approved emergency plans to build 400000 apartments to 
house the refugees 
the waves of newcomers this year nearly 200000 of them east 
germans making a dramatic exodus to the west is starting to 
overwhelm west germany 
east germans ethnic germans from poland and the soviet union 
and asylumseekers are rapidly changing the face of the nation 
those three groups are expected to account for about 700000 
newcomers this year 
west germany with a population of nearly 62 million has been 
an economic success story and has become a magnet for east germans 
as well as the ethnic germans across eastern europe 
although west germany has welcomed them there is increasing 
uneasiness about the thousands of new citizens 
we have to tell them that west germany is not a paradise 
west german trade union federation chief ernst breit told a postal 
workers conference on sunday in mannheim 
while breit was referring to the expectations of the east 
germans many politicians business leaders and ordinary west 
germans are beginning to question the countrys ability to handle 
the strains posed by the newcomers 
social services have been strapped and the influx of children 
has filled kindergartens to capacity nationwide clothing drives 
for the new arrivals have become an almost daily occurrence 
local governments have been crying out for more federal aid to 
bear the load and unemployment is swelling to nearly 2 million 
there was a shortage of affordable housing even before east 
germanys communist authorities found themselves unable to hold 
back the flood and east germans fled by the thousands 
tuesdays approval of 43 billion to subsidize construction of 
the new apartments over a fouryear period is nearly twice the 
amount planned for lowcost housing just a few months ago but 
chancellor helmut kohls government felt it had to act to ease the 
housing crisis 
as housing shortages persist social services are overloaded and 
unemployment rises the government is expected to face demands for 
action to slow the flow of newcomers 
west german politicians have shown increasing signs of alarm and 
have called on east german authorities to institute reforms to halt 
the exodus 
we want them east germans to be able to live in their 
traditional home there and to be able to find happiness kohl 
told a red cross convention on saturday 
many of the east german refugees are being put up in hotels and 
others have been housed in camps or on floating barracks designed 
for construction workers 
east germans put up in a temporary shelter in a camping area in 
hamburg have already staged a protest complaining of unbearable 
conditions and saying they cant afford the 43 they have to pay 
per month per person 
but housing is only one of the problems 
the federal labor office said monday the number of unemployed 
workers among the east german refugees stood at 61700 as of last 
month out of the total of 167200 people who had reached west 
germany by then the total east german refugee number is expected 
to top 200000 by the end of the year 
still many employers look at the east germans as a source of 
new labor willing to take jobs that west germans avoid and perhaps 
willing to work for lower wages 
ethnic germans and asylumseekers already were stretching social 
services and local budgets before august when the east germans 
started flowing into west germany 
we still expect between 350000 and 400000 ethnic germans 
this year said ina ruehl a red cross specialist who helps to 
integrate the influx of ethnic germans from the soviet union 
romania and elsewhere in eastern europe 
she said in an interview with the associated press the federal 
government is spending 12 billion this year to teach them german 
while many also receive substantial unemployment benefits as of 
october there were 115000 unemployed among the recent arrivals of 
ethnic germans 
west germany also has attracted huge numbers of political 
asylumseekers most of them from third world countries as well as 
turkey poland and yugoslavia 
they benefit from bonns liberal policies that allow most of the 
asylumseekers stay for years even if their application is rejected 
on sunday bishop martin kruse the head of the lutheran church 
in west germany appealed for more help for the asylumseekers who 
are allowed to stay even if their request is rejected 
these people often live for years in legal uncertainty and 
without any outlook for the future kruse told a church 
convention in bad krozingen near freiburg rejection of an asylum 
application generally bars the foreigners from working legally in 
west germany 
on monday the federal interior ministry announced that 98700 
asylumseekers had arrived in the first 10 months of the year

in an emotionally charged case pitting 
protection for children against the rights of parents the supreme 
court was urged tuesday to uphold the indefinite jailing of a 
maryland woman for refusing to disclose her sons whereabouts 
social workers fear the child may be dead 
mitchell mirviss a lawyer appointed to represent the missing 
child predicted extreme ramifications if the mother is allowed 
to go free to safeguard her fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
upholding her rights would mean an infant who is defenseless 
and abused must be abandoned in an unprecedented extension of the 
fifth amendment he said 
assistant attorney general ralph s tyler of maryland agreed 
where will we be if the state cannot enforce contempt of 
court orders to assure childrens safety he asked will the most 
effective remedy be taken away 
allowing the fifth amendment to outweigh the childs welfare 
could hamstring juvenile courts tyler said 
the court engaged in a spirited onehour discussion in the case 
of jacqueline bouknight 23 in a baltimore jail for more than 18 
months for refusing to disclose where her son is 
bouknights lawyer george e burns said authorities have other 
alternatives to jailing the parent indefinitely for contempt of 
court 
she could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries a 
threeyear prison term he said 
its not true that the state can do nothing burns said 
its not a matter of we cant do it we just wont do it 
some justices raised the possibility that a ruling in the case 
expected by july could rest on narrower grounds 
justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy noted that 
since bouknight was jailed maryland has enacted a law that permits 
law enforcement officials to grant limited immunity from 
prosecution to compel testimony 
in bouknights case they suggested the state could require her 
to reveal her sons whereabouts in return for assurances that the 
disclosure will not be used to convict her of any criminal charges 
oconnor described the process as a laserlike limited 
immunity that would permit prosecution of bouknight without 
compromising her protection against selfincrimination 
social workers last saw bouknights son maurice in september 
1987 when he was 11 months old 
maurice was admitted to a baltimore hospital on jan 23 1987 
when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg and 
other injuries for a while he was held in protective care after 
his emotionally troubled mother was observed throwing maurice into 
his crib during the infants hospitalization 
maurice was returned to his mothers custody on july 17 1987 
after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo 
training in parenting skills 
justice harry a blackmun expressed dismay tuesday at that 
development 
why do we need hindsight to realize the boy was in jeopardy 
he said wasnt it apparent at the time 
nine months after maurice was returned to his mother social 
workers said bouknight no longer was cooperating with them 
moreover they said maurices father recently had been shot to 
death in a drugrelated killing and bouknight was using drugs 
the mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on april 28 
1988 after she refused to disclose maurices whereabouts 
the maryland court of appeals ruled in december that jailing her 
for refusing to disclose the information violates her 
constitutional protection against selfincrimination 
but she has remained in jail under an order by chief justice 
william h rehnquist 
some have compared the bouknight case to that of dr elizabeth 
morgan of washington dc released from prison on sept 25 after 
more than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter 
visit the girls father morgans former husband 
morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl now 7 for 
courtordered visits with the father morgan accused her former 
husband of sexually abusing the child charges he consistently has 
denied 
in a pair of decisions tuesday the court 
refused by a 72 vote to ease the technical requirements 
facing people who sue to protect the environment 
the justices ruled that the victory it took an oregon farm 
couple three years and 95000 to win against their county for 
polluting their water supply had to be thrown out because 
government agencies were not notified before the lawsuit was filed 
voted 81 to make it easier for insurance companies to sue in 
federal court to challenge worker compensation awards the decision 
allows an illinois insurer to go into federal court to attack a 
texas mans worker compensation benefits

martin millers persistence has paid off 
seven years after the retired treasury department official launched 
a campaign to change the cia and state department maps of israel 
and jordan the lines have been redrawn 
soon after he retired in 1981 miller noticed that a 
governmentpublished map book showed the west bank of the jordan 
river as part of jordan despite the fact that the united states 
never recognized jordans 1950 annexation of the 2200squaremile 
territory 
the redrawn us map shows the west bank as a cultural region 
bearing its original biblical name of judea and samaria not 
attached to either israel or jordan 
for years the official us maps published by the central 
intelligence agency showed the israelijordanian border drawn along 
the 1949 armistice line between the two countries which defined 
israels physical borders until the 1967 war 
israel captured the west bank in that war and has occupied the 
land since despite calls from the rest of the world to negotiate a 
political settlement for the territory 
miller said he pursued his case in a factual rather than 
ideological manner 
if i were trying to peddle my views i wouldnt have gotten 
very far he said 
his first step was a letter to alexander haig then president 
reagans secretary of state haig referred millers letter to the 
state departments office of the geographer 
that office maps official us policy on sovereignty issues for 
internal state department publications and acts as an advisory and 
arbitration board for other government agencies issuing maps 
miller began corresponding with the geographer who issued a 
1982 directive ordering cartographers to stop showing the west bank 
as anyones territory 
still most maps went unchanged 
miller also wrote his congressman who unsuccessfully pursued 
the case with the state department 
george shultz took over from haig miller who had dealt with 
shultz when shultz was treasury secretary asked for a meeting in 
1984 
miller made his case meticulously buying a computer to help 
prepare 92 documents for shultz to buttress his argument 
the meeting was exciting he said but nothing changed 
also in 1984 miller read an article by thendeputy cia chief 
robert gates who said the agency was emphasizing accuracy and 
objectivity 
miller said he called gates and told him his people were not 
adhering to his standards two days later on jan 2 1985 he 
met with two cia officials 
they promised the maps would be changed but a year later 
nothing had changed miller said 
only after dealing with the agencys chief cartographer did his 
crusade bear fruit the map of jordan was changed in 1986 but it 
took until january 1989 to change the israel map 
the state department is reluctant to ascribe all the credit to 
miller but concedes his campaign influenced the decision 
he was very very active and believed in his cause said 
one official familiar with the case 
but shultz who knew from bitter experience how hard it was to 
bring about any political change in the middle east was more 
expansive 
im glad you kept at it and accomplished something that is of 
genuine and lasting significance shultz said in a letter to 
miller earlier this year

two men and two women briefly disrupted 
supreme court proceedings tuesday as they stood up to denounce a 
recent high court ruling limiting abortion rights 
the supreme court has declared war on women and im here to 
declare war on the supreme court said one of the woman 
according to spectators in the courtroom 
i had an abortion 20 years ago said the other woman 
before she was led from the courtroom by court police 
all four were arrested and charged with disrupting the high 
court an offense that carries a 30day jail sentence and a 100 
fine upon conviction said court spokeswoman toni house 
arrested were michael madewell 27 of athens ga benjamin 
fraser troxell 26 of cleveland heights ohio sandra lines 41 
of jersey city nj and michelle pahl 27 of new york city 
a group called refuse amp resist distributed a statement that said 
the protest was intended to focus attention on the court as an 
oppressor of women 
the oppressors of women will know no peace until the dogs are 
called off from attacking womens abortion clinics the 
statement said 
the court last july 3 gave states new power to limit abortions 
but stopped short of overturning its 1973 ruling that said women 
have a constitutional right to abortion 
such protests are highly unusual during the normally sedate 
court proceedings

iran has applied to rejoin the 
international chess federation after an absence of eight years a 
senior chess official said tuesday 
its a return to the fold said the federations president 
florencio campomanes of the philippines 
he said iran would be considered a provisional member of the 
124member federation as soon as it pays its back dues 
ayatollah ruhollah khomenei the late iranian leader banned 
chess following the 1979 revolution last fall however he said 
the game was acceptable so long as it did not involve gambling 
the general secretary of the iranian chess federation khosra 
hirandi told chess officials that women and men would not be 
allowed to play one another according to boris kutin of 
yugoslavia a member of the international federations 14man 
executive council 
campomanes said iran would compete with the other countries of 
the middle east 
there was a question of whether it was compatible for iran to 
be in that zone when iraq was in the same zone and mr harandi 
said there was no problem from that direction he said 
campomanes said the last iranian to compete in a federation 
competition was in 1979 although it continued to pay membership 
dues until 1982 
casto abundo of the philippines the federations general 
secretary said he did not know how much the iranian chess

new jersey voters chose between 
democrat james florio and republican james courter for governor 
today with florio heavily favored for the office he nearly won 
eight years ago 
turnout was reported moderate in some places to heavy in others 
including florios district in southern new jersey 
its jim florio driving it said pat marshall the 
democratic administrator with the camden county board of elections 
lets be honest here thats the only issue in camden county 
the two candidates ended their campaigns with voteseeking 
dashes despite florios wide lead in the polls 
im very comfortable that weve been able to get our message 
out and now of course the goal is to get people out to vote 
florio said at an election eve rally monday at a racetrack in 
cherry hill 
the rally which featured fireworks and a 10piece rockjazz 
band entertaining 4000 supporters brought a raucous end to 
florios bid to win the job he lost narrowly to gov thomas h kean 
in 1981 
courter continued to dismiss the polls that show him trailing by 
24 points 
we have a great state and its important for all of us to go 
to the polls on tuesday courter told supporters in lyndhurst 
ignore what some of the pundits are saying ignore what some of 
the pollsters are saying because people are the ones who vote not 
polls 
florio who has held a consistent lead in the polls has widened 
the gap to 24 points over courter according to a poll released 
sunday by rutgers universitys eagleton institute of politics and 
the starledger of newark 
florio lost to kean in 1981 by 1797 votes out of nearly 24 
million cast or onetwelfth of 1 percent the closest margin in 
state history 
courters campaign has been mired in internal problems and the 
candidate has stumbled on some delicate issues such as abortion and 
homosexual rights 
by contrast florio has largely avoided pitfalls and put courter 
on the defensive a series of nasty television commercials have 
marked both campaigns 
each candidate ran a commercial in which his opponents nose 
grew a la pinocchio with every alleged lie or misleading statement 
cited in the spot 
in addition to todays gubernatorial election also at stake is 
the battle for control of the assembly republicans hold a 4139 
edge and there are hotly contested races in 10 districts 
the party that wins control of the legislature also will control 
the redrawing of congressional districts after the 1990 census the 
democrats control the senate which does not face election this 
year

gen michel aoun said tuesday he rejected 
the entire peace plan adopted by parliament and the generals 
followers roamed christian areas beating street vendors who 
ignored a strike supporting him 
the christian army commander originally accepted political 
reforms in the accord worked out at taif saudi arabia but 
rejected security arrangements that did not include a timetable for 
withdrawal of syrias 40000 soldiers from lebanon 
aoun calls the syrians who are in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league an occupation army 
hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded in a sixmonth 
artillery war between aouns men and the syrians that was suspended 
by a truce in september 
on tuesday the general said we reject all of the taif 
accord lebanon was killed in taif and buried in kleiat where they 
elected a president for a syrian state in lebanon 
parliament met at kleiat in syriancontrolled northern lebanon 
on sunday and elected rene mouawad a maronite catholic as 
president it also endorsed political reforms worked out by 
legislators at taif with arab league mediation which give moslems 
more power in an effort to end the 14yearold civil war 
the legislators moved their sunday session to northern lebanon 
because aoun threatened to shell the parliament building in beirut 
at a news conference tuesday aoun said a plan has been 
prepared details of which will not be announced now to defend our 
liberated area a reference to the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north and east of beirut in which 1 million christians live 
aoun has no control in the 70 percent of lebanon outside the 
enclave and the peace accord presumably will be applied there he 
also has serious opposition from other christians and it is unclear 
how long the government central bank will continue paying his bills 
mr mouawad is not an elected president he is only a former 
legislator i had dissolved parliament before his election aoun 
said at his headquarters and residence a bunker beneath the 
shattered presidential place in baabda a christian suburb east of 
beirut 
he and acting prime minister salim hoss have led competing 
christian and moslem governments since september 1988 when the 
sixyear term of president amin gemayel ended without parliament 
agreeing on a successor 
by unwritten covenant the president has been christian the 
prime minister sunni moslem and the parliament speaker shiite 
moslem since independence from france in 1943 
christians were the majority in 1943 and have controlled the 
government army and judiciary but moslems now make up 55 percent 
of the population their demand for more power is a main cause of 
the civil war which has taken more than 150000 lives since 1975 
vice president abdulhalim khaddam of syria drove to mouawads 
hometown of ehden in north lebanon late tuesday to see him and 
told reporters 
syria which has supported and continues to support lebanons 
unity will extend all assistance requested by the government 
to establish its authority on every inch of lebanon 
in a clear reference to aoun he said no one no matter how 
far he goes in craziness can continue because the process of 
reconciliation will bypass the deviationists and all those who 
sabotaged the unity of the nation and are trying to subvert 
reconciliation and reunification 
mouawad 64 continued consultations with politicians to form a 
government of national unity that would try to end the war 
at the french embassy in hazmieh just south of baabda about 
500 youths chanted aoun is the legitimate leader 
waving lebanese flags and placard portraits of aoun they 
shouted for president francois mitterrand of france to protect 
lebanon about 40 of them began a sitin at the main gate 
the french have been the christians main protectors since they 
governed the country under a league of nations mandate france the 
united states arab nations and other governments have declared 
support for mouawad 
aoun asked his followers to end the twoday strike because they 
had expressed your views honestly 
witnesses in ashrafiyeh said aoun supporters with sticks beat 
vegetable vendors who ignored the strike 
one said a vendor shouted while being beaten we want peace 
we want to work to make money we live from handtomouth 
an editor at voice of lebanon the main radio station in 
christian east beirut said privately that 100 of the generals 
followers tried to storm the station monday night and read 
statements on the air but christian militiamen guarding the 
building drove them off

road hoffman said 
about an hour later he said a group of marine guards and 
army mps military police were fired on by a small group of 
intruders the us marines and soldiers returned the fire 
there was a second exchange somewhat later hoffman said 
pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy wood said the exchange of 
gunfire was the first in months 
after the failed coup attempt against gen manuel antonio 
noriega last month the top us military commander in the region 
gen maxwell thurman recommended that the rotations of military 
personnel be speeded up so that us dependents could be removed 
from the area more speedily 
hoffman said that no decision had been made on that 
recommendation 
there are about 10000 us military permanently assigned to 
panama with slightly more than 2000 on temporary duty there also 
are about 2700 us civilian department of defense employees as 
well as about 7700 military dependents and 3300 civilian dod

but the johnston ri woman struck a defiant tone describing

id love to see what official is going to enforce it she 
said 
mrs parrillo said she is no longer dating the man involved in 
the case but her new boyfriend sometimes sleeps over while the 
children are home 
a judge ordered the visitation limit as an outgrowth of a 
childcustody battle between mrs parrillo and her former husband 
and a lawyer representing the woman said the order has a sexist 
overtone 
i would be surprised if judges were as willing to serve as 
moral guardians of a family where a man is involved said steven 
brown executive director of the american civil liberties unions 
rhode island chapter 
thomas desimone an attorney for mrs parrillos former husband 
justin said he was not surprised by the courts action because he 
did not feel that a federal question was involved 
and brown said he believed the high court chose not to take the 
case because the justices felt it was simply a strange little 
case from rhode island that didnt deserve the courts attention 
the parrillos were divorced in 1986 under a joint custody 
agreement their three children live with her and their father has 
visitation privileges 
mrs parrillo 33 said her exhusband began to harass her when 
he learned she was dating joseph dipippo she asked for a court 
order limiting parrillos visitation rights requiring him to see 
the children at specific times away from the home 
parrillo countered by asking a judge to prevent mrs parrillo 
from having overnight male guests 
judge william goldberg who has since retired barred mrs 
parrillo from allowing any unrelated males to stay overnight 
when the children are home the judge said having such guests is 
not a suitable arrangement for the children to be put into 
the children were 8 10 and 13 when the judge issued his order 
in late 1986 
the rhode island supreme court upheld goldbergs order in march 
saying we cannot fault goldbergs actions we see no great 
constitutional issue in this controversy 
neither side had sought experts to testify about the 
psychological effect of the visits on the children 
in other matters the high court 
removed the last legal obstacle to carrying out a 25 billion 
settlement for victims of the dalkon shield birthcontrol device 
agreed to decide in a case from illinois whether lawsuits 
charging employers with violating a key federal antibias law must

in a troubled quest for reconciliation 
with an erstwhile enemy chancellor helmut kohl travels to poland 
on thursday with aid to offer and two diplomatic dustups to 
overcome 
the first visit by a west german chancellor in 12 years is aimed 
at normalizing relations with the east european state overrun by 
nazi germany a half century ago 
kohl brings with him more than 1 billion worth of financial aid 
and credit guarantees to help poland through the transition to a 
marketoriented economy 
but the historic visit and prospects for a clean break with past 
hostilities have been marred by the hasty resignation of bonns 
ambassador to poland and embarrassment over kohls failed attempt 
to visit the scene of a 1921 battle between germans and poles 
the trip has been beset by volatile negotiations stalled by the 
leadership changes in poland and disputes within the bonn 
government over the nature and pace of assistance west germany 
should offer to promote reform 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher had expressed the wish 
this year that a highlevel west german delegation make the 
emotional gesture of attending memorials in warsaw marking the 50th 
anniversary of the start of world war ii 
however negotiators for the two states were unable to clear 
away old political and economic differences until oct 3 
preventing an official visit coinciding with the sept 1 
anniversary 
despite that missed opportunity kohls visit remains a symbolic 
atonement for the wartime horrors inflicted on poles by germans 
kohl and other west german officials have spearheaded the drive 
for western aid to reward reformminded nations like hungary and 
poland as they move away from planned economies and stalinist 
controls on personal freedom 
west germany already is polands biggest western trading partner 
bonn announced earlier it would reschedule or forgive 13 
billion of warsaws overdue foreign debt 
west german banks and government lending institutions hold about 
20 percent of polands foreign loans which total 39 billion or 
more than 1000 for every man woman and child in the country 
horst teltschik kohls chief foreign affairs adviser said 
before the trip to warsaw that west german aid could potentially 
exceed the billiondollar level established in the negotiations he 
conducted with mieczyslaw pszon of the polish foreign ministry 
bonn will guarantee credits for any economically reasonable 
jointventure projects agreed to by west german firms teltschik 
said 
he said the test of their economic reason would be whether they 
promised to be selffinancing within a few years 
among the agreements to be signed by kohl and polish prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki are credit guarantees for projects to 
improve living conditions in the areas of western poland populated 
by ethnic germans 
nearly one third of poland was once german territory 
kohl plans to meet with members of the german minority in 
warsaw but has scrapped a plan to visit st annes mountain 
because of strong objections by his polish hosts 
the mountain known in german as annaberg was the scene of 
bloody confrontation between poles and germans in 1921 warsaw 
officials reportedly feared that a visit by kohl could stir 
interethnic hostilities in the formerly german region of upper 
silesia 
the annaberg plan was deemed illconsidered and has been 
compared with kohls controversial 1985 visit with president ronald 
reagan to an ss gravesite in bitburg 
adding to the predeparture turmoil was the unceremonious exit 
of the west german ambassador to warsaw 
two weeks prior to the warsaw trip franz joachim schoeller 63 
was granted early retirement after claiming the stress of kohls 
visit and a recent flood of east german refugees through the 
embassy had damaged his health 
west german media have reported ulterior motives for schoellers 
decision to step down at such a crucial time contending it was 
prompted by internal disputes within the bonn government or by his 
alleged involvement in an arms trading firm

more than 300 potential jurors will be 
interviewed starting wednesday about their awareness of drunken 
driving as the trial starts for a man accused of killing 27 people 
in a fiery bus crash 
larry mahoney is charged with 83 separate crimes including 27 
counts of murder for his role in the crash of a church bus on 
interstate 71 on the night of may 14 1988 
the prosecution charged that mahoney was drunk behind the wheel 
of his pickup truck traveling the wrong way on the highway when it 
slammed into a bus from a radcliff church returning from an outing 
at an amusement park 
defense attorney william summers said he knows that most 
potential jurors will have heard of the case which prompted 
national debate over the safety of school buses and the dangers of 
drunken drivers 
they know it happened summers said they know it inflamed 
passions and prejudice in them but despite whatever those are 
that they will at least make a sincere promise to go out of their 
way to try and be objective 
the prospective jurors will be questioned in three large groups 
before individual interviews that judge charles satterwhite has 
ordered closed to the public 
summers said his ideal juror will have some understanding of how 
widespread drinking and driving has become potential jurors also 
will be asked if they have been convicted of drunken driving 
mahoney 36 pleaded guilty to driving under the influence 
several years ago in another case he currently faces a charge of 
driving under the influence in the current proceeding along with 
dozens of assault and wanton endangerment charges for the injuries 
to the 40 people who escaped death in the crash 
after the crash mahoney spent several weeks in the hospital and 
was then examined at the kentucky correctional psychiatric center 
he was jailed until until october 1988 when his family put 
together enough money and property to post his 540000 bond 
mahoney returned to work at mampt chemicals in carrollton and 
lives with his parents in nearby worthville mahoney neither drives 
nor drinks anymore summers said 
survivors of the crash most of whom were members of the first 
assembly of god in radcliff are expected to testify at the trial 
people who lost family members in the crash are expected to attend 
at least parts of the trial which could last six weeks or more

president bush on tuesday steered clear of 
criticizing his predecessor ronald reagan for accepting a 2 
million trip to japan saying everybodys got to make a living 
he also passed up an opportunity to comment on nancy reagans 
controversial book my turn but indicated his recollection of 
his relationship with her husband was not quite the same as what 
she wrote 
mrs reagan wrote that bush told her during the height of the 
irancontra controversy that he thought chief of staff donald regan 
should resign she said she told him to tell her husband that and 
he said nancy thats not my role 
bush was asked if he shared that recollection and if his own 
vice president dan quayle should act that way 
no i think its his role to tell me anything thats on his 
mind which is exactly the relationship i had with president reagan 
and thats the way i worked as vice president bush replied 
asked to comment further on mrs reagans version he said 
no i cant help you on that i dont want to get into that 
one then he added laughing why never mind 
bush was asked whether it was appropriate for reagan to accept 
2 million from a communications congolmerate for a speaking trip 
to japan last month 
he said i will not have anything negative to say about 
president reagan if this is an invitation for that because id 
prefer to emphasize the positive parts of that trip talking openly 
about the need for freer trade the affection shown to him by the 
japanse people its important symbolism when it comes to this 
relationship that sometimes has strain 
pressed on whether former presidents should make money through 
private industry he said i have no problem with that providing 
its not overdone everybodys got to make a living

sen edward m kennedy is preparing a 
confrontation with president bush on civil rights by proposing an 
update of the 1964 civil rights act that the president has called 
unnecessary 
the legislation that the massachusetts democrat plans to file 
within weeks would overturn several supreme court rulings handed 
down in june that made it easier to challenge affirmative action 
programs and more difficult for workers to sue their employers for 
racial bias 
bush said then that the impact of the decisions was being 
overblown 
one highly publicized decision upheld the right of several white 
firefighters from birmingham ala to challenge the departments 
minority hiring plan 
republican conservatives in the senate say they will fight the 
legislation particularly if the president sticks by his position 
if the president is committed to a veto we can sustain a 
veto said sen charles grassley riowa adding that civil 
rights advocates want to embarass bush 
kennedy said that bush isnt sure more legislation is needed 
in my view the need is obvious kennedy said a new 
national civil rights act will send a strong message that congress 
does not intend to abandon our 25yearlong commitment to civil 
rights 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said the 
administration is taking a waitandsee attitude 
we havent come out and said absolutely no to the 
legislation she said we dont think the legislation is 
absolutely necessary at this time but once its proposed we will 
not sit back 
kennedy and other lawmakers have been working with a broad array 
of civil rights advocates labor unions and womens groups to craft 
a bill that can be introduced in virtually identical form in both 
the house and senate said ralph neas of the leadership conference 
on civil rights

the united states on tuesday vetoed a 
security council resolution that would have demanded that israel 
return property confiscated from palestinians during a tax protest 
britain france canada and the other 11 members of the council 
all voted for the resolution which would also have sent a 
factfinding mission to observe israels crackdown on the 
palestinian uprising 
the united states is deeply distressed by the continuing 
violence and confrontation in the occupied territories said us 
ambassador thomas r pickering 
we have repeatedly called on all parties to exercise maximum 
restraint to avoid bloodshed and reduce tensions he said 
calling the antiisraeli resolution onesided pickering 
said such resolutions and the divisive debate that accompanies 
them do not help to alleviate conditions in the areas not do they 
help to create an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of 
constructive dialogue between israelis and palestinians 
arab league ambassador clovis maksoud said afterward the us 
veto renders hollow its claims of sensitivity and sympathy for 
the palestinian sufferings and its objections to israels clear 
violations of palestinian human and civil rights 
the us veto means that the palestinians would remain hostage 
to israels brutal measures without a consequential protection by 
the united nations maksoud said 
israel began tax raids on the predominantly christian 
palestinian town of beit sahour on sept 20 troops confiscated at 
least 15 million in machinery cars household goods and personal 
effects to be sold at auction 
hanna alatrash the mayor of beit sahour estimated 90 percent 
of the town of 10000 people boycotted paying taxes to israel to 
protest the military occupation beit sahour is just southeast of 
bethlehem in the west bank 
stinging under a storm of international criticism israel lifted 
its roadblocks around the town last week 
on monday israeli ambassador johanan bein shifted the focus of 
the debate describing the axmurders or stabbings of five 
palestinians in october the victims were mutilated some in front 
of family members or while praying in a mosque 
indeed the rate of plo attacks against palestinians increased 
sharply following the promulgation of israels peace initiative in 
april 1989 he said saying seven times as many palestinians were 
being attacked

the statehouse painting of the two rhode 
islanders who signed the declaration of independence is perfect in 
every detail except one of the faces is of the wrong person 
an error dating to 1823 caused pennsylvania statesman john 
dickinson to end up in former rhode island gov stephen hopkins 
spot in the portrait that hangs outside the house speakers office 
the mistake was discovered more than a decade ago but no one 
did anything about it until hopkins descendents kicked up a fuss 
it finally will be fixed wednesday with the unveiling of a new 
portrait but rhode islanders will have to settle for a picture of 
hopkins son rufus 
amazing said kathryn ohare spokeswoman for secretary of 
state kathleen s connell whose office is in charge of statehouse 
tours and guidebooks its kind of comical actually 
stephen hopkins left no portraits behind when he died in 1785 
and when artist john trumbull sought him out seven years later for 
inclusion in his famous painting of the signers of the declaration 
he had to settle for rufus hopkins townspeople assured trumbull 
that the son closely resembled the father 
trumbull finished the painting in 1820 and three years later 
prepared a key matching faces to names but he confused hopkins 
dickinson and george clinton of new york said irma b jaffe a 
retired fordham university professor and trumbull scholar 
theres no way of knowing how it came to be confused jaffe 
said in a telephone interview it was a long time since he had 
done the painting and he might have just confused them 
shortly after the statehouse was built in 1900 officials 
decided they needed a portrait of hopkins and william ellery the 
two rhode islanders who signed the declaration of independence so 
they sought out the trumbull painting and had an artist copy the 
patriots faces the artist relying on the key faithfully painted 
ellery and dickinson 
jaffe said she discovered the errors in 1972 while comparing 
trumbulls original sketches of the signers with the finished work 
the general assembly became aware of the error shortly after 
jaffe published her findings but nothing was done because its a 
beautiful picture and no one knew except scholars and stephen 
hopkins fans that the face was not correct said state rep ray 
rickman 
there was another problem no one knows who is responsible for 
the dozens of dusty paintings that line the statehouse walls 
the secretary of states office and the rhode island historic 
preservation commission each say the other is responsible the 
secretary of state does have some power to decide where the 
paintings should be hung ohare said but her records show the 
hopkinsellery portrait is in the governors office no one knows 
how it ended up outside the speakers office 
last year hopkins heirs finally persuaded the legislature to 
replace the picture a commission of which rickman was a member 
hired newport artist john p hagen for 4000 to make a new 
portrait 
hagen said his work is based on the trumbull sketch of rufus 
hopkins and an examination of hopkins home which still exists in 
providence 
jaffe said there was no way trumbulls sketch could be wrong 
the eyes are grey and the hair and so forth jaffe said 
its quite specific 
dickinson a practicing quaker was wearing a hat as his 
religion required in trumbulls painting while hopkins a lapsed 
quaker was not jaffe said

a drug trafficking trial has taken a 
startling turn with the defendant testifying he was trying to track 
down a drug dealer he says absconded with 500000 in a plot to 
kill pakistans former leader 
the unusual defense built around pakistani president gen 
mohammed zia ulhaq who died in a mysterious plane crash isnt 
something the defendants lawyer said he would have chosen to take 
into the courtroom 
its not my idea of the best defense believe me stephen 
ferrarone courtappointed attorney for mushtaq malik said 
tuesday i would prefer not to have my guy stand up and say i 
may have been involved in an assassination 
prosecutors declined comment as they prepared to begin 
crossexamination wednesday 
the 41yearold defendant who prosecutors say is known as the 
black prince stopped short of saying he was involved in the 
plane crash that killed zia on aug 17 1988 malik was arrested in 
brazil on the drug charges five months before the crash in which 29 
other people died including us ambassador arnold raphel 
malik is being tried on charges of conspiracy and importation of 
heroin prosecutors claim malik arranged for samir n houchaimi of 
amman jordan to bring 10 million in heroin to the united states 
houchaimi was arrested at a bus terminal in springfield in 
february 1988 he was carrying a nylon handbag filled with two 
kilograms of heroin that he told authorities he had been given in 
cyprus to sell for malik 
after his arrest houchaimi arranged a meeting in rio de janeiro 
with malik and a us drug agent operating under the alias mr 
costa transcripts of those calls have been introduced as 
evidence 
malik and the agent met ostensibly to make plans to go to costa 
rica but instead malik was arrested and returned to the united 
states 
maliks defense according to his testimony monday is that he 
actually had contracted with houchaimi to kill zia malik testified 
he advanced at least 500000 to houchaimi on behalf of superiors 
in the pakistan peoples party currently led by prime minister 
benazir bhutto to hire people and buy equipment for the 
assassination 
malik said he followed the 51yearold houchaimi to the united 
states after it became obvious that the plot was stalled he said 
he then played along with drug plans in hopes of retrieving the 
money 
i dont know anything about money for heroin in america he 
testified monday 
malik was basically in a position where he would have been 
totally wiped out he has said that he would either have to come up 
with this money or commit suicide ferrarone said 
the lawyer said his client doesnt fear retribution for his 
testimony of assassination plotting from the current pakistani 
government which maintains the cause of zias death is unknown 
the pakistani consulate in boston did not return a telephone 
call to the associated press on tuesday

a second computer problem within a week at the 
washington air route traffic control center caused some flight 
delays tuesday the federal aviation administration reported 
there was never a safety issue said faa spokeswoman diane 
spitaliere the worstcase scenario was massive delays and that 
never happened 
officials said a problem with telephone lines caused a computer 
at leesburg va to lose contact with some remote radar 
facilities meaning information about some flights had to be put 
into the system manually 
the problem started in the early morning hours and was corrected 
by noon causing minimal delays in flights ms spitaliere said 
she said the faa was investigating the cause and trying to 
determine how it can be prevented from reoccurring 
thousands of airline passengers flying into out of or through 
the washington area encountered long delays friday when air traffic 
controllers at the center lost about half their computer capacity 
flights headed for the nations capital were grounded in various 
cities and flights in the air were kept about 25 percent farther 
apart officials said

increased government control and 
inspection has caused a significant decline in the destruction of 
the amazon rainforest brazils top environmental official said 
tuesday 
were still waiting for the final numbers but we estimate the 
devastation will be 30 percent less than in 1988 the results are 
not optimal but they are very good said fernando cesar 
mesquita the president of the brazilian institute of environment 
and renewable natural resources 
the destruction could have been curbed even more mesquita said 
if the united states britain france italy and west germany had 
provided requested aid for ecological protection 
regrettably we didnt get any help he said 
the institute was founded earlier this year amid an 
international outcry over the devastation of brazils 2 
millionsquaremile amazon jungle the worlds largest mesquita 
said he went to the united states and europe to seek money for 
radarmapping equipment patrol helicopters patrol boats 
fourwheel drive vehicles and telecommunications gear 
he said he couldnt get the equipment from his own government 
because brazil just doesnt have the money however he said 
brazilian sources provided five patrol helicopters that were 
instrumental in spotting unauthorized tree cutting and burning 
last year illegal land clearing by farmers ranchers 
prospectors and peasant settlers wrecked some 55350 square miles 
of brazilian rainforest according to the government 
the heaviest rains in more than five years also helped save 
amazonian trees from being burned mesquita said 
the institute which supervises only 612 forest rangers in a 
region about half the size of europe summarily removed local 
forest officials suspected of corruption and protecting landowners 
who were destroying the ecology mesquita said inspectors 
discovered 300000 acres of illegally cleared jungle land from aug 
1nov 3 and levied fines of about 16 million 
the situation is very difficult mesquita said we are up 
against powerful interests they try to buy off forest officials 
and when that doesnt work they threaten to kill them 
he said one federal official on an inspection mission was killed 
this year others were shot at or intimidated and an institute 
helicopter was sabotaged 
also hindering environmental control are the growing cocaine 
trade landless peasants rough freelance gold miners and 
sinister bureaucracy he said 
amazon protection will be a hot potato for brazils next 
president mesquita said president jose sarney who has announced 
wideranging proecology measures leaves office in march voters 
will choose his successor nov 15 in brazils first direct 
presidential vote since 1960 
none of the 22 presidential candidates has presented really 
serious proposals for protecting the environment mesquita said 
brazils small green party does have a presidential contender 
but polls give him almost no chance of winning 
mesquita said the institute is trying to get congress to change 
a law that encourages settlement in the amazon region by giving 
landtax discounts to settlers who absorb the expense of clearing 
up to 50 percent of their land 
the idea of that law was to promote development and at the 
same time protect at least 50 percent of the rainforest but what 
happens is that someone sells half his land and the next guy 
clears 50 percent of that and so on until theres nothing left 
with a 110 billion foreign debt the highest in the developing 
world brazil is open to foreign proposals for debtforecology 
swaps mesquita said but it hasnt received any

city council despite heated opposition from 
several hundred gun owners and their supporters approved a ban 
tuesday on semiautomatic assault weapons 
the ordinance passed just after midnight by a vote of 94 
its regrettable that we have to take this action because the 
legislature didnt have the courage to said councilman dave 
doering 
tom gleason a spokesman for mayor federico pena said the 
ordinance will take effect once it is signed by pena and published 
probably next week 
the law carries penalites of 500 to 999 in fines and 10 to 120 
days in jail 
residents who owned assault weapons before adoption of the 
ordinance will be able to keep them but they will be required to 
register them within 60 days 
criminals are going to behave like criminals said 
councilwoman cathy reynolds who proposed the ban 
we have however made a small step to give police a tool to 
confiscate what we now publicly consider antisocial weapons 
when they are found in the course of their work and we have sent a 
message that these particular semiautomatic weapons are not welcome 
in the city and county of denver 
i think thats the useful thing to do its not going to solve 
crime and we never said it would she said 
more than 700 people packed into denvers city and county 
building for a public hearing monday night a total of 297 people 
signed up to speak against the proposal and 30 were in support but 
some did not get the chance to speak because the hearing ended on 
schedule at 11 pm 
gun enthusiasts held signs outside the chambers that read ban 
liberals not firearms 
at one point during the hearing council members threatened to 
leave after one speaker called reynolds a rapist of the 
constitution 
the council staff turned off the microphone and the man left 
police chief aristedes zavaras spoke in favor of the ban 
dennis martin president of the american federation of police 
opposed it 
recent research has opened new evidence that an armed public 
has and is a powerful deterrent to crime martin said 
offenders do recognize the gunowner as a potential threat to 
their well being

the states two us senators are on opposite 
sides of a dispute over whether a university mascot a 
headdressbedecked american indian chief should be discarded as 
offensive 
chief illiniwek has been a symbol of the university of illinois 
since 1926 prancing at sporting events and emblazoning clothing 
coffee mugs and other paraphernalia 
robert honig a prelaw student at the school began a fight 
last month to dump the chief saying it was an insult to american 
indians 
there is no way we would tolerate someone dressed as an 
oldtime black slave dancing on the field or someone portraying a 
jew said honig who is from suburban skokie 
democratic sen paul simon of illinois agreed and joined the 
effort to find a new mascot his fellow democratic senator alan 
dixon is prepared to lead a fight to keep the mascot 
because of opposition the university in champaignurbana has 
agreed to have cheerleaders and band members stop wearing 
indianstyle face makeup during games school spokesman terry 
shepard said tuesday 
but he added i think it would take something very cataclysmic 
for the chief to be done away with 
the chief is named for a confederacy of woodland tribes that 
once lived in illinois and parts of wisconsin iowa and missouri 
dixon is an alumnus of the university and said he is filled with 
pride for my school every time he sees the chief 
simon acknowledged monday during a chicago visit that the chief 
is a revered figure to university of illinois fans 
but it remains a sore point for many native americans he 
said i would favor further discussion that could eventually lead 
to a new mascot for the university 
other schools have changed indian mascots including stanford 
university which several years ago changed the name of its sports 
teams from the indians to the cardinal

hunt netted nearly 130 more gators than the first season and 
officials expect healthy catches for years to come 
during the monthlong hunt in september 222 licensed hunters 
caught 3117 gators including a 13foot6 monster bagged on the 
north side of lake okeechobee and a 685pounder from lake george 
near ocala 
the catch represents about 91 percent of the quota and compares 
with 2988 caught in 1988 the first statesanctioned alligator 
hunt in 26 years 
part of the reason officials renewed the hunts was the 
burgeoning alligator population believed to exceed 1 million in 
florida 
were not trying to reduce the alligator population said 
mike jennings a wildlife biologist with the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission we want to have these hunts years after 
year 
a study of this years catch indicated the alligator population 
is generally healthy and growing well said jennings

the paris periwinkles stuffed butterflies under 
windshield wipers with unusual alacrity tuesday as part of a 
crackdown on illegal parking a major contributor to the citys 
nightmarish traffic 
periwinkles are what the french fondly call their meter maids 
and butterflies are what far less fondly they call parking 
tickets traffic policemen and police auxiliaries are helping with 
the blitz of illegal parkers 
after a brief publicity campaign notifying the public that the 
days of lax enforcement were over and the anything goes style 
of french parking had gone authorities sprang into action monday 
with tickets and tow trucks 
its really interfering with my work said rodrigues 
barbosa a housepainter working in a central paris apartment i 
keep having to climb down from the ladder and stick my head out of 
the window every 15 minutes 
it was worse for drivers of delivery trucks who block narrow 
streets with impunity and unload their wares with majestic 
nonchalance at all hours despite restrictions on delivery times 
you simply cannot work in paris without breaking the law 
one said 
another complained theyre not really attacking the traffic 
problem theyre taking it out on drivers what they need is to 
build more parking places in paris but thats more complicated 
paris is blessed with wide avenues but they are knit together 
by hundreds of narrow streets that quickly become congested 
parisians desperate for a places to leave their cars park them 
on sidewalks in crosswalks at taxi stands theyll even park 
double or triple at intersections 
no one is being spared in the painful new regime police and 
periwinkles named for their light blue uniforms have orders to 
ticket every violator accept no excuses accede to no pleadings 
special attention is being paid to those who park 
dangerously as in bus lanes towaway tickets are stuck on 
windows radio calls placed and the vehicles vanish in 15 minutes 
its quite a shock to go out and see your car gone said a 
journalist who parked in a taxi stand when he arrived at work 
monday night 
paris police said 457 vehicles were towed away monday compared 
with about 300 on a usual day they said 10117 parking tickets 
were issued 23 percent more than the previous monday 
a ticket for parking that disrupts traffic costs 230 francs 
37 parking in a delivery zone is worth 500 francs 80 and 
retrieving a vehicle from the car pound lightens the wallet by 471 
francs 75 dangerous parking might cost a drivers license 
users of paris streets must appreciate the consequences of the 
increase in individualistic parking conduct which is at the very 
least cavalier if not outright dangerous police chief pierre 
verbrugghe said last month 
city plans call for eliminating 100000 parking places in 10 
years and creating 300 red streets where parking will be 
prohibited to facilitate through traffic 
how long the current heat will last is not clear 
before when i was writing a ticket and the owner of the 
vehicle arrived i had a tendency to let it go a periwinkle 
said but now we are under very strict orders nobody escapes

the insurance company for the boston symphony 
orchestra will have to pay court costs for the legal battle between 
actress vanessa redgrave and the symphony the state supreme court 
ruled tuesday 
commercial union insurance co had refused to provide coverage 
for the symphony during its sevenyear court tangle but the 
states high court found the company liable possibly for as much 
as 1 million which is the amount symphony attorneys say was 
incurred during the legal dispute 
by the time the case came to a close this year redgrave had 
collected 12000 in damages 
redgrave and her company sued the boston symphony in 1982 after 
the symphony canceled a series of performances of igor stravinskys 
oedipus rex which redgrave was to narrate the series was 
called after protests about redgrave and her propalestinian 
politics 
prior to filing the lawsuit redgraves attorneys sent a warning 
letter to the symphony demanding an apology and asking that the 
performances be restored the letter said the actress had a right 
to speak freely without fear of blacklisting or discrimination and 
should not be publicly ridiculed 
but the engagement was not revived and redgraves lawsuit 
alleged that the symphony breached its contract with her causing 
her to lose other professional engagements among other things 
commercial union argued that redgraves suit constituted a 
generic breach of contract claim since its policy with the 
symphony called for providing coverage for injuries stemming from 
libel slander or other defamatory material commercial union said 
it should not be liable 
the symphony sued commercial union in 1984 
in its decision the state supreme court ruled that the claim 
involved broader issues and that commercial union was obliged to 
defend the symphony in the matter 
though a us district court jury initially awarded her 
100000 us district judge robert e keeton threw out the award 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals later restored 12000 of the 
award 
redgraves attorneys petitioned the us supreme court to hear 
the case but were refused

laxity and dangerous standards on british rail led 
to the deaths of 35 people last year in a triple train collision in 
london an official inquiry reported tuesday 
faulty wiring in the signal system was the immediate cause of 
the disaster during the morning rush hour dec 12 said sir anthony 
hidden the judge who headed the inquiry the fault caused a signal 
to remain green although a train was stopped just beyond it 
in addition to the dead more than 100 people were injured when 
one commuter train rammed the rear of a stopped commuter train 
outside busy clapham junction in south london the wreckage was 
then struck by a freight train 
hidden said the signal failure reflected a deterioration of the 
safety culture in the stateowned rail system 
the relevant errors include the facts that working practices 
were permitted to slip to unacceptable and dangerous standards 
hiddens report said 
the quality of supervision was permitted to slip to an 
equivalent degree so that those unacceptable and dangerous working 
practices were allowed to continue 
among 93 recommendations to improve safety hidden called for 
priority in installing radios in the cabs of trains and installing 
airlinestyle black boxes and more research on improving 
rolling stock to protect passengers in the event of an accident 
within the signals department hidden called for radical 
improvement in recruiting and training and an end to excessive 
overtime 
technicians testified at a public hearing that they worked long 
hours and days off because of a shortage of qualified staff 
after the report was released clifford hale resigned as quality 
manager for the british railways board he was the regional 
signaling engineer at the time of the accident 
hiddens report said hale made the dangerous assumption that 
once a problem was identified it would be fixed the problem 
about mr hales management was that it demonstrated the lack of 
communication which pervaded the signals and telecommunications 
department the report said 
i accept all the inquirys recommendations here and now 
said british rails chairman sir robert reid we have taken 
steps to ensure that the circumstances that led to this tragedy can 
never be repeated on british railways 
reid said more than 32 million has been spent solving problems 
identified following the clapham disaster

president bush saying the fate of the 
american hostages in lebanon is with him every single day held 
out hope tuesday that the return of frozen iranian assets might 
help prompt tehran to work for the captives freedom 
id like to get this underbrush cleaned out bush said in 
response to a question about whether the plight of the hostage was 
tied to the disposition of iranian assets seized by the united 
states a decade ago 
bushs comments at a news conference came a day after us 
officials announced iran would receive 567 million a portion of 
the money frozen by washington after radical students stormed the 
american embassy in tehran in 1979 
bush said he didnt know if the release of the money would 
affect the eight americans 
i carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day 
he said 
bush administration officials repeatedly have rejected linking 
the hostages fate to the assets on the grounds the united states 
does not negotiate for captives 
bush has appealed to proiranian moslems holding the hostages to 
free them on humanitarian grounds 
but bush said he hoped actions of the iranus claims tribunal 
in the hague a body established in 1981 to iron out financial 
claims and counterclaims between the two countries could help the 
hostages 
i think they the iranians have made some positive 
statements but i dont know whether it will work that way or not 
i hope that they will do what they can to influence those who hold 
these hostages 
nevertheless bush said the administration had run into dead 
ends following certain rabbit trails in behindthescenes 
efforts to free the hostages 
peggy say the sister of terry anderson the longestheld 
hostage in lebanon called the release of the 567 million damned 
good news 
anderson the middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was captured in march 1985 
i would expect the ball is in the court of iranian president 
ali akhbar hashemi rafsanjani mrs say said 
last month rafsanjani offered to help get the western hostages 
freed if the united states released frozen assets or helped settle 
the cases of three iranians captured by christian lebanese 
militiamen in 1982 
shireen hunter an expert on iranian affairs at the center for 
strategic and international studies a think tank cautioned 
against reading too much into the tribunal actions in the hague 
it isnt really a quid pro quo she said of links between 
the hostages and the assets nevertheless the tribunals actions 
are another step in confidencebuilding or mistrustreducing 
between tehran and washington she said 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the 567 million 
was the amount transferred to iran after iran satisfied debts to 
american banks over the last several months the money came from an 
account that contained about 800 million 
the remainder about 243 million was put in a security account 
that will be used to pay off others claims to americans the 
security account must contain a minimum of 500 million at all 
times officials said 
the agreement was worked out in party by abraham sofaer the 
state departments legal adviser who met with iranian officials in 
the hague on nov 2 and 3 boucher said 
the usiranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part of 
the arrangement that led to the release of american hostages held 
for 444 days in tehran after seizure of the us embassy by 
militants 
there are several other claims outstanding including irans 
demand for compensation for military equipment purchased before the 
1979 islamic revolution but never delivered 
the united states transferred 99 billion in frozen assets to 
the jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981 before the banks 
settlement this month some 38 billion had been transferred to 
iran

in the battle between sharks and people it 
turns out that the jaws most to be feared are those of humans 
the national marine fisheries service announced tuesday that the 
sharks in the north atlantic may need protection 
sharks have been overfished for a decade resulting in a severe 
depletion in the western north atlantic the commerce department 
agency said 
once a secondary product caught by fishermen seeking tuna and 
swordfish sharks have become a soughtafter seafood on their own 
said pat kurkul of the fisheries service in gloucester mass 
shark meat is becoming common on american stores and shark fins 
are increasingly exported she said 
feared for their voraciousness featured in such films as 
jaws sharks are slow to mature have a long reproductive cycle 
and produce only a few offspring annually officials said 
so serious is the concern that the fisheries service is taking 
the extraordinary step of scheduling a series of hearings over the 
next two months to discuss the problem and draft a management plan 
for the fish 
the plan could include setting a commercial quota requiring 
permits for commercial use and establishing recreational bag limits 
that plan could go to the secretary of commerce by february and 
take effect by june said ms kurkul 
mako is the most commonly caught and sold species of shark but 
the management plan would consider some 38 species if they are 
found to be in danger she said

president bush gave himself high grades 
tuesday on the anniversary of his election vowed to veto and 
exhort until congress approves his programs and brushed aside 
criticism that he has responded too timidly to the awakening of 
democracy in eastern europe 
bush at a midmorning news conference also expressed fresh 
hope iran would help win the release of american hostages in 
lebanon after a us decision to release 567 million in frozen 
assets to tehran 
i carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day 
bush said he said he hoped the release of the iranian funds would 
get underbrush cleared out 
separately the state department said that release of the money 
was not linked with the hostages 
bush opened the election day news conference by saying his 
administration has come together rapidly with good people and 
with good ideas and a quiet sense of purpose 
after nearly 10 months in office bush said i enjoy it i 
like the challenge 
expressing satisfaction with his record in international and 
national affairs bush said he had seen the greatest surge toward 
democracy around the world in at least 40 years 
bush brushed aside criticism most recently from former 
president jimmy carter that he has responded too cautiously to 
changes sweeping the soviet union poland hungary east germany 
and elsewhere in eastern europe 
id like to hear some specific suggestions other than triple 
the spending on every initiative bush said besides he said 
i dont hear complaints coming out of our allies or indeed out 
of hungary or poland or eastern europe 
coincidentally within an hour of bushs press conference the 
entire east german cabinet resigned amid demands on the communist 
party for reform and change in leadership 
things are happening very fast bush said he said the push 
toward democracy has gone too far to irreversibly set back 
the progress i dont think you can contain now the peoples 
aspirations for freedom by going back to totalitarianism 
bush had originally viewed east germanys new leader egon 
krenz as a hardliner but said that may have been premature now 
there are some signs that thats not the case he said 
looking ahead to his meeting next month with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev bush said that he remained concerned about 
the kremlins support for the revolutionary government of nicaragua 
and that other superpower differences remain 
he said that to suggest that everything is hunkydory simply 
is not reality and thats one of the reasons im looking forward 
to this visit 
on the domestic front bush accused congress of delaying action 
on his proposals for cleanair legislation an antidrug program 
and ethics laws democrats have tried to go beyond bushs proposals 
in a number of areas and republicans have resisted 
bush urged the press and public alike to turn up the heat on 
congress telling lawmakers to take a step get your foot in the 
water do something 
yet acknowledging that his options were limited bush said his 
strategy would be to exhort what else can i do veto and 
exhort 
bush recently vetoed two spending bills over a provision to 
expand the use of medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor 
women in cases of rape or incest bush said he would not retreat 
from his stand 
i cant do it and im sorry i am not going to change that 
policy said bush who supports federal funding for abortion only 
when the life of the mother is endangered 
he dismissed the importance of abortion as a critical issue in 
gubernatorial elections in virginia and new jersey saying most 
voters are not swayed by a single issue and that abortion ranks 
only somewhere between ninth and 14th on the list of issues that 
voters consider important 
on other points bush 
refused to criticize former president ronald reagan for 
accepting a 2 million fee for a private visit to japan saying 
i will not have anything negative to say about president 
reagan he added everybodys got to make a living 
rejected criticism from environmentalists and some members of 
congress who complain he is stalling efforts to combat global 
warming environmental policy cannot be driven by the extreme 
bush said as more than 60 nations acting over the opposition of 
the united states japan and the soviet union urged the world to 
stabilize by the year 2000 the emission of gases blamed for the 
greenhouse effect 
said it is up to china to take positive steps to restore good 
relations with the united states in the aftermath of the bloody 
crackdown on prodemocracy forces the chinese have a slogan he 
who ties the knot should untie it bush said 
said he is willing to consider meeting israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir when he visits the united states later this

an acrylic painting by a 25yearold minnesota 
wildlife artist of two blackbellied whistling ducks was selected 
tuesday to be used for the next duck stamp covering the 199091 
hunting season 
the award brings prestige and financial reward to the artist 
jim hautman of plymouth minn who could earn as much as 1 
million from commercial printings and other royalties although the 
government pays no money for use of the painting 
five judges selected hautman who had entered the duck stamp 
competition four previous times after they sifted through 603 
entries during two days of judging at the interior departments 
auditorium 
well over a million of the stamps with hautmans design will be 
sold for the 199091 waterfowl hunting season bringing 1250 
apiece to the government last year the interior department 
received more than 13 million from the sale of the stamps 
although the government sold nearly 14 million stamps last 
year the demand for the stamps has been declining in recent years 
about 24 million stamps were sold yearly in the early 1970s 
norma oprand chief of the federal duck stamp program 
attributes the decline to the reduction of the waterfowl 
population with fewer ducks there are tighter restrictions on 
hunting and fewer hunters to buy stamps 
but the duck stamp created in 1934 and produced every year 
since then is much more than a source of federal revenue for the 
artist whose painting adorns the stamp 
for the wildlife artist theres nothing greater than the 
federal duck stamp says neal anderson the winner last year who 
was selected in his sixth try with a painting of a pair of lesser 
scaup nestled amid a growth of reeds in a pond 
barred like every other winner from competing for three years 
anderson observed this years competition as the judges reduced the 
competitors to 26 entries on the first day and narrowed on a winner 
tuesday 
being selected for the duck stamp brings a wildlife artist 
instant recognition 
youre one of a handful of people that have a piece of us 
history said anderson 
and then there are the monetary rewards 
the government does not pay the artist a dime but in recent 
years proceeds from the sale of prints have been lucrative as have 
commissions from commercial use of the winning design on everything 
from tshirts to commemorative plates 
the artist himself should gross around 1 million or a 
millionplus says anderson 
the award transcends to the artists other works as well 
anderson said noting his other paintings sold more quickly and the 
value of his works in galleries rose 20 percent to 30 percent 
youre not a better painter than the day before you win 
youre just more wellknown he said

a propelling charge exploded during artillery 
testing at the yuma proving ground killing two israeli soldiers 
inside a tanklike vehicle us army officials said tuesday 
an israeli team of four soldiers was test firing the modified 
selfpropelled m109 howitzer at the desert base when the accident 
occurred monday afternoon army capt stephen mcgeorge said 
the israeli defense force in jerusalem said the soldiers were 
working on a joint project with the us army 
two israeli soldiers outside the howitzer were injured they were 
in satisfactory condition at yuma regional medical center the base 
public affairs office said the identities of the soldiers were 
withheld pending notification of relatives 
mcgeorge said the propelling charge apparently exploded the 
projectile and fuse were not explosive 
the fuse and projectile were filled with sand they were not 
explosive the shell was an iron body filled with sand and the fuse 
was inert mcgeorge said he said the shellfuse combination 
weighed about 100 pounds 
mcgeorge said the soldiers had fired about 70 of the 100 rounds 
they were scheduled to fire monday these guys were firing 
intermittently over the course of an eighthour day he said 
the israeli army said the accident involved an artillery piece 
being jointly produced by the united states and israel countries 
buying us equipment sometimes test the equipment at us 
facilities us officials said 
the proving ground is in arizonas southwestern corner near the 
california line the site of the accident was sealed off pending 
investigation 
mcgeorge declined to discuss which country was responsible for 
maintaining the artillery that will be part of the 
investigation he said 
because the howitzer was a prototype investigators will have 
far more detailed records on its parts and maintenance than if 
the accident had happened in the field mcgeorge said 
the howitzer was severly damaged mcgeorge said 
he didnt know its cost and declined to discuss the specific 
modifications 
the yuma daily sun reported jan 3 that israeli soldiers were 
testing an m109 equipped with computerized fire control and 
navigation systems the systems would allow the selfpropelled 
howitzer to automatically point its cannon at a target while keeping 
constant track of its own location the sun said 
the sun also reported officials planned to increase the 
howitzers firing speed to three rounds every 15 seconds from four 
rounds a minute by installing a new loading device that would insert 
the howitzers 100pound shell into the breech automatically 
mcgeorge said the howitzer may have been equipped with the 
device called a flick rammer but they were not trying for any 
speed records

the senate armed services committee will begin 
hearings next week on the explosion aboard the uss iowa that claimed 
the lives of 47 sailors the panels chairman said tuesday 
sen sam nunn dga said the panel will hold hearings both on 
the april 19 blast and the navys investigation of it 
the navy concluded that gunners mate clayton hartwig most 
likely caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator 
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch guns 
but since the service issued its report on sept 7 members of 
congress hartwigs family and the sailors former shipmates have 
criticized the navys conclusions 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of a house armed 
services subcommittee that also is reviewing the matter cited an 
fbi report that said its laboratory inquiry was inconclusive 
mavroules said the fact that two government departments the 
pentagon and the fbi failed to reach the same conclusions raises 
serious doubts about the navys findings 
however rear adm richard milligan who oversaw the navys 
technical and criminal study said in an interview last week that he 
stands by his conclusions 
i am not aware of anything that would cause me to change my 
report he said

one of the changes enacted by congress in response 
to the savings and loan crisis may have the unintended effect of 
making new homes more expensive thrift and housing executives said 
tuesday 
officials of the us league of savings institutions the thrift 
industrys largest trade group have identified the new restriction 
on loans to one borrower as a top priority in their campaign to 
amend sampl legislation passed in august 
the new limit is 15 percent of an institutions capital down 
from 100 percent previously a level that allowed an institution to 
fail because of the default of a single borrower 
the lower limit was intended to break up the relationship between 
some builders and a few thrift executives who would fund highly 
speculative development projects 
but us league president fred webber said 15 percent is too 
restrictive kent w colton executive vice president of the 
national association of home builders said war stories are 
beginning to filter in from builders whose credit lines with sampls 
have been cut drastically 
home builders need large acquisition and development loans to 
prepare subdivision plots for sale he said 
im not talking about dollars to finance land speculation 
there are people who have sold the lots but cant get the money to 
put in infrastructure he told 3600 delegates to the leagues 
97th annual convention 
colton said a scarcity of development loans could increase the 
cost of new homes and said builders and sampl executives should unite 
to lobby congress to ease the restriction 
david seiders chief economist of the home builders said sampls 
may eventually learn to cope with the new rule which has applied to 
national banks for years by combining in groups to make development 
loans or by selling shares in the loans to other institutions 
meanwhile house secretary jack kemp drew cheers from the sampl 
executives by repeating his call for lower interest rates 
the federal reserve board has been trying to ease inflation 
pressures by slowing the economy with high interest rates a policy 
kemp called a barbaric solution to the inflation equation 
lower interest rates are absolutely critical for making homes 
affordable to americans he said new homes sales in september 
according to the commerce department plunged 14 percent the 
sharpest dive in nearly eight years 
however economists appearing at a panel discussion predicted the 
fed would only reluctantly ease interest rates as signs of economic 
sluggishness emerged 
the decade is going out with a whimper and you might get some 
shortterm relief from high interest rates said james christian 
chief economist of the sampl trade group 
christian is predicting that construction of new homes will 
remain flat at about 14 million units in 1990 and 1991

conservative leader constantine mitsotakis 
began efforts to form a new government under a presidential mandate 
bestowed on monday but faces an uphill battle for success 
mitsotakis has three days to organize enough support to persuade 
president christos sartzetakis he can put together a cabinet if he 
fails former premier andreas papandreou will be given the 
exploratory mandate 
mitsotakiss new democracy party came in first in elections last 
sunday but missed a parliamentary majority it was the second time 
in five months greeks went to the polls only to get an inconclusive 
result 
a third set of elections this year is likely if no leading party 
can fashion a government the standoff has delayed major decisions 
on the ailing economy and foreign policy 
a conservativecommunist alliance formed after elections in june 
was empowered only to investigate allegations of scandals in 
papandreous former administration 
in three days i will return to the president and inform him of 
the results of my efforts mitsotakis told a news conference 
he must marshal the support of 151 members of the 300seat 
parliament to win approval of his government new democracy won 148 
seats last sunday papandreous panhellenic socialist movement 
known as pasok won 128 and the communistled coalition of the 
left and progress won 21 
mitsotakis faces tough going pasok and the coalition ruled out 
teaming with new democracy and one of the three independents is 
allied with the leftists 
but mitsotakis said he expected to gain the seat won by an 
independent environmentalist citing a legal ambiguity that may 
allow his party to contest the seat in a special electoral court 
he said he will not enter any alliance that will force his party 
to water down its program to revive the economy and seek closer 
us ties 
papandreou was expected to appeal to the coalition to join pasok 
in a government 
if no coalition emerges the president will offer the major 
parties the chance to form a joint administration a proposal 
supported by the coalition 
if that fails new elections will be called 
a new democracy official ioannis palaiokrassas said the 
parties will try to avoid new elections 
i dont see new elections right now for the simple reason 
that no party wants them nor do the greek people only in 
the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections he said 
new democracy and the coalition have said they will not repeat 
their summer alliance as their programs are incompatible their 
government handed over to a caretaker administration in october 
after parliament indicted papandreou and five of his former 
ministers on charges of corruption 
more elections would not necessarily produce a strong 
government a proportional electoral system introduced by pasok 
earlier this year makes it difficult for any party to win a 
parliamentary majority 
the new parliament includes some celebrities actress and former 
culture minister melina mercouri was reelected on the pasok ticket 
leftist composer mikis theodorakis who did the soundtrack for 
the film zorba the greek was elected running as a new 
democracy candidate a former communist party deputy he announced 
in october he was cooperating with the conservatives in a crusade 
against urban terrorism 
mitsotakis daughter dora bakoyannis won overwhelmingly in the 
mountainous constituency of evritania the seat was formerly held 
by her husband new democracy spokesman pavlos bakoyannis who was 
murdered by extremeleft urban guerrillas on sept 26

five foreign countries froze 60 million in 
bank accounts owned by a major narcotics trafficker a senior us 
drug enforcement official said tuesday 
the official terrence m burke acting deputy administrator of 
the drug enforcement administration said efforts are being made to 
freeze an additional two or three bank accounts belonging to the 
same columbian drug dealer 
burke told reporters the action represents a significant advance 
in the war on drugs because it is an example of valuable 
cooperation by the government of colombia and the five other 
nations in which the numerous bank accounts were located 
burke disclosed the development during testimony before a house 
foreign affairs subcommittee hearings held to evaluate the bush 
administrations attempt to attack major drug cartels at the source 
in colombia and other latin american nations 
elaborating on his testimony after the hearing burke declined 
to identify the drug dealer whose accounts were frozen or to name 
the countries in which the accounts were located no american banks 
are believed to be involved burke said 
based on information provided by the colombian government in 
the last 10 days we have been able to identify and freeze bank 
accounts in five countries that contain at least 60 million 
burke told reporters 
he said the accounts were not part of a money launderingsystem 
but represent savings accounts of one of the major colombian 
narcotics dealers 
these are accounts which we believe contain liquid assets of 
this particular trafficker burke said 
burke said the drug dealer is being sought by law enforcement 
authorities 
i think this development demonstrates international 
cooperation burke said the colombian authorities developed 
this information in real time and gave it to us and several other 
countries cooperated in turn to freeze these funds i think thats 
very significant 
we are striking at the heart of these trafficking syndicates 
by confiscating their money and goods burke said in his prepared 
testimony 
he noted that earlier this year the dea and other federal and 
foreign law enforcement agencies conducted a joint operation dubbed 
operation polar cap which closed down a moneylaundering 
enterprise that handled some 12 billion in illicit drug profits 
belonging to colombias medellin cartel 
operation polar cap resulted in the seizure of more than one 
ton of cocaine the confiscation of 92 million in cash jewelry 
and real estate and the indictment of 127 individuals burke said

the defense department acknowledged tuesday 
that a planned 9 billion system for jamming enemy radar has 
problems and that a major review has been ordered to determine 
whether the program will proceed 
the program came under fire in september when sen david pryor 
dark called it a potential waste of billions of dollars and 
quoted navy documents that called the system marginally 
operationally effective 
the airborne selfprotection jammer will deceive or jam enemy 
radar and will be carried aboard navy and air force fighter planes 
including the f14 f18 f16 and av8b 
the defense department planned to produce 2369 of the jammers 
at a total cost of 94 billion over the expected 20year life of 
the program so far 681 million has been spent 
aircraft are to be equipped with electronic warfare systems that 
use a radarwarning receiver to alert a pilot when the airplane is 
being tracked by enemy radar it also sends out signals to confuse 
enemy missiles or radar creating false targets or giving opponents 
the idea that us planes arent where they seem to be 
many electronic warfare systems are in use and determined to be 
satisfactory but the services are pursuing the new system in the 
expectation of growing technological threats 
it has problems pentagon spokesman fred hoffman told 
reporters when he was asked about the system but he declined to go 
into detail saying only that the system had performance 
reliability problems 
deputy defense secretary donald atwood and the undersecretary of 
defense for acquisition james betti are engaged in the 
problem hoffman said 
where we stand now is that there has been a memorandum that 
calls for a review of the program after a oneyear period 
hoffman said adding that the pentagon then will decide whether to 
continue the program 
meanwhile he said a limited production of 100 units has been 
ordered 
work is being done on this and we hope to get this thing on 
track hoffman said 
duane p andrews nominated to be assistant secretary of defense 
for command control communications and intelligence told the 
senate armed services committee that support for the system remains 
strong despite problems 
im told its the most effective system that we currently have 
for our deployed forces and the office of the secretary of defense 
is standing behind the program andrews said at his confirmation 
hearing tuesday 
according to pentagon sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified the program is four years behind its original 
production start date 
the source said that the delays were due in some measure to 
updated threat intelligence information and a decision to delay 
development to upgrade the system 
the pentagon inspector general and the general accounting office 
are reviewing the decision to proceed with the program the source 
said 
navy capt matt small told the washington post in an article 
published tuesday that we dont do a good job of evaluating 
jammer performance and that problems with the programs flawed 
test methods and equipment can be overcome 
the source said a joint air force and navy group has been formed 
to improve those testing procedures and that the effort is expected 
to be completed by the end of the year 
in a report released in september the gao said the test 
equipment used by the air force to determine the effectiveness of 
the radarwarning receivers and other electronics on tactical 
fighters was faulty and unreliable 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said the problems 
undermined the combat readiness of the aircraft and attributed the 
problems to the air forces acquisition process in which it bought 
test sets before determining whether they would work properly

the bush administration urged the supreme 
court on tuesday to give us law enforcement officials broader 
power to conduct searches in foreign countries 
the justices were told in a case involving a notorious mexican 
drugsmuggling operation that the constitution gives us agents 
more leeway when they investigate away from us soil 
justice department lawyer lawrence s robbins said fourth 
amendment safeguards against unreasonable searches were not 
designed to protect rights in every quarter of the globe 
he described as zaniness any constitutional interpretation 
that would require us officials to get a warrant from a us 
judge before searching a home in another country 
but michael pancer representing an alleged highranking drug 
dealer said the high court should not authorize a raiding 
party on foreign soil 
if a warrant is required us agents must either get one or 
they must not search he said 
justice antonin scalia questioned what judge in the united 
states would have authority to issue a warrant to search a foreign 
residence where do you go he asked you call warrant 
central 
us agents without a warrant in 1988 searched the home of rene 
verdugo urquidez in mexicali mexico verdugo was convicted in 
california last year of taking part in the 1985 kidnapping torture 
and murder of drug enforcement administration agent enrique 
camarena and his pilot 
verdugo identified as a top lieutenant to mexican drug kingpin 
rafael caro quintero is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life 
and is not eligible for parole for 59 years when he would be 96 
but his conviction in the murders is not at issue in the case 
argued tuesday that is expected to yield a high court ruling by 
july 
the issue is whether the 9th us circuit court of appeals based 
in san francisco properly suppressed evidence the dea found when it 
searched verdugos home 
verdugo had been arrested two years earlier by mexican police 
and was turned over to us authorities in california 
the bush administration said the power of us law enforcement 
officials particularly dea agents to help in foreign 
investigations is at stake 
the dea has offices in 45 nations and last year helped in 
investigations that it said led to 1200 arrests of suspected drug 
smugglers in foreign countries 
the search of verdugos home was conducted in conjunction with 
mexican police 
robbins argued that even if the fourth amendment applies to 
foreign searches by us agents the search of verdugos home was 
reasonable and did not violate the suspects rights 
pancer said the search was unreasonable for example he said 
the us agents were cooperating with a mexican police officer they 
knew had a history of taking bribes and the searchers by mistake 
first went to the wrong house 
requiring a search warrant is designed to prevent such abuses 
he said 
the case is us vs verdugourquidez 881353

prosecutors say they will appeal a 
judges decision to drop a childabuse charge against the mother of 
a baby born addicted to cocaine 
broward circuit judge robert b carney said he based the 
dismissal on an earlier case that determined floridas childabuse 
laws do not apply to a fetus 
in the earlier case the 4th district court of appeal in west 
palm beach decided charges of battery against an infant could not be 
brought against a man who shot a pregnant woman who delivered a 
wounded baby 
the state will certainly seek to appeal said assistant state 
attorney dennis bailey after carney dismissed charges monday against 
cassandra gethers 23 of hollywood 
ms gethers remains in jail serving an 18month sentence for 
violating probation she received for an earlier conviction for 
possession of cocaine her attorney russell adler said she may be 
released in one to three months 
she wants to get her baby back get a job and get counseling 
he said 
she was arrested in february and charged with child abuse after 
she and her baby daughter were found to be cocainedependent 
no woman has been convicted in the united states of child abuse 
as a result of harm she caused her baby by using cocaine during 
pregnancy 
the state attorneys office said it prosecuted ms gethers 
because she also gave birth in february 1988 to a cocainedependent 
son and was counseled at that time on the dangers of using cocaine 
while pregnant

a fungus from australia is showing up well as a 
natural killer of destructive grasshoppers that threaten crops and 
rangeland the agriculture department said tuesday 
jerry fowler director of the departments grasshopper integrated 
pest management project said preliminary laboratory experiments 
indicated that the fungus entomophaga praxibuli can infect and 
kill a broad range of the pesky hoppers 
usdas animal and plant health inspection service said that if 
the fungus proves out it could help lessen the need for chemicals 
to control the pests the project plan is to integrate the fungus 
with research demonstrations in north dakota next year 
the fungus only affects grasshoppers the agency said 
laboratory tests using doses at least 100 times greater than any 
found in nature have repeatedly shown that the fungus causes no harm 
to other insects and does not affect humans or other mammals 
scientists isolated the fungus from grasshoppers during an 
outbreak in australia in 1985 
the dry climatic conditions in the wanwibinda region of new 
south wales where this fungus was discovered are similar to 
americas northwestern rangelands where outbreaks annually infect 
millions of acres the agency said

us army surgeons are learning trauma 
treatment skills at a wattsbased hospital that has one of the 
busiest emergency rooms in the country tending to the carnage of 
gang gunshot victims 
the county board of supervisors on tuesday approved a motion to 
expand the presence of military physicians at beleaguered martin 
luther kingdrew medical center into other areas including 
obstetrics and pediatrics 
the countyrun hospital has been under fire and its director was 
recently removed following reports that it was understaffed and 
underfunded 
tuesdays motion by supervisor kenneth hahn whose district 
includes the hospital calls for the health services department to 
develop a proposal within two weeks for expanding the military 
physician training program 
army doctors usually receive their trauma surgery training at 
public hospitals near their home bases 
but military officials say that the young surgeons rarely see 
the kinds of gaping multiple wounds caused by automatic and 
semiautomatic gunfire like those common to gang shootings here 
where more than 353 gangrelated slayings were reported last year 
a pair of us army resident physicians from texas recently 
completed a twomonth training program at kingdrew where 
officials say gang mayhem creates a virtual steady stream of 
gunshot victims 
here youll see a case where a 22 caliber gun 
accidentally discharged said dr john mcphail chief of surgery 
at william beaumont medical center in el paso texas on tuesday 
but at king the typical shooting was a victim shot multiple 
times by someone trying to kill them with larger caliber and more 
bullet holes in the patients 
the 430bed hospital treated almost 3500 trauma victims in 1988 
nearly 40 percent of the countys trauma patients hospital 
officials said 
county health officials estimate doctors there treat more than 
100 gunshot cases and dozens of stabbings each month 
mcphail said he got the idea to send military physicians to los 
angeles last year after dr arthur fleming chief of trauma and 
surgery at kingdrew attended a trauma conference at william 
beaumont and gave a talk on the situation at the los angeles 
hospital 
i said this is a place where we should be sending some of 
our residents and staff mcphail recalled 
a telephone call to flemings office on tuesday was not 
immediately answered 
dr john holcomb a fourthyear resident at beaumont medical 
center in texas completed his twomonth stint in trauma surgery at 
kingdrew last week 
he said tuesday in a telephone interview that while he did see 
several gunshot victims only a few were suffering from high 
velocity weapon wounds of the type inflicted by militarytype 
weapons 
there were nights that were extremely busy about two 
saturdays ago it got really busy that was the night i got called 
in on my time off there was a guy walking around with a 45 
shooting people holcomb said 
county health officials said the pilot program may be expanded 
and army officials said they hope to make it a permanent part of 
their surgical training 
mcphail said holcomb told him that while the experience was 
excellent he also felt he was providing a service as well 
in addition to the two doctors from beaumont another army 
surgeon from fitzsimmons army medical center in aurora colo 
trained at kingdrew two more surgeons from beaumont and two more 
from fitzsimmons are scheduled to train at the hospital over the 
next year

the irancontra prosecutor urged the us court 
of appeals on tuesday to issue a transcript of a closed hearing in 
the case of joseph fernandez the former cia station chief in costa 
rica 
independent counsel lawrence walsh told the richmond va court 
that a censored version of the transcript from the aug 23 hearing 
should be made public because much of the testimony isnt 
potentially damaging to national security 
justice department lawyers prevailed on the court to close a 
portion of that hearing dealing with cia programs in costa rica 
aimed at protecting the country against a possible invasion by 
nicaragua 
in a court filing walsh said intelligence agencies had 
authorized him to disclose that information and that the justice 
department approved its disclosure at public trial 
but the department said the information contained in documents 
prepared by the government still was considered classified for 
purposes of oral argument 
even federal law protecting classified information implies that 
the attorney general may not certify the closure of an entire 
hearing where only a portion of that hearing risks disclosure of 
classified information walsh said 
thus while the attorney general has authority to close an 
argument because of the likelihood that classified information will 
be disclosed the attorney general has no authority to prohibit 
access to a redacted unclassified transcript walsh said 
walshs court filing was in support of five organizations cbs 
inc the new york times co the washington post the american 
civil liberties union and the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press that have filed a motion for access to a redacted transcript 
fernandez is charged with obstructing the tower commission and 
the cia inspector general and making false statements in the 
irancontra affair he allegedly assisted white house aide oliver 
norths secret contra resupply operation 
his trial is delayed while the justice department decides whether 
it wants to appeal a ruling that the attorney general may not 
intervene in the fernandez case with court appeals to protect 
classified information 
the ruling leaves attorney general dick thornburgh with the 
option of allowing certain classified information to be divulged at 
fernandezs trial or filing an affidavit barring its disclosure 
filing an affidavit could scuttle the prosecution

the environmental protection agency may be 
improperly excluding up to 2000 hazardous waste sites from its 
superfund cleanup program and deliberately limiting the number of 
cases it will handle according to testimony tuesday before a house 
subcommittee 
epas requirement to meet statutory guidelines and its desire 
to reduce its tremendous workload is causing the site reject rate to 
steadily increase joel s hirschhorn of the congressional office 
of technology assessment told the government operations subcommittee 
on environment energy and natural resources 
witnesses at the hearing said that epas system for identifying 
sites that would qualify for superfund and federal aid for 90 
percent of the cleanup cost is inadequate because it relies heavily 
on information from state and local governments 
state governments sometimes are reluctant to report sites for 
superfund cleanup because states must pay 10 percent of the bill 
witnesses said 
to hold down costs states have settled with the polluters often 
resulting in a less expensive less reliable cleanup according to 
testimony states also have not told epa about some sites forgoing 
federal funds because they thought epa cleanup was too 
timeconsuming said gao official richard l hembra 
the cost of cleaning up an average superfund site runs from 21 
million to 30 million the house appropriations committee estimated 
last year 
the superfund has a 101 billion authorization for 10 years 
beginning in 1986 subject to actual appropriations of funds from 
year to year 
hirschhorn said that epa under pressure because of the high 
costs and heavy caseload is ruling out too many sites too early and 
with too little information 
in a report released last month the office of technology 
assessment calculated that from 246 to 2000 sites may have been 
excluded from superfund that should have been included the estimate 
was derived from a number of studies and data and did not refer to 
specific sites 
the general accounting office estimates that there are from 
130000 to 425000 potential hazardous waste sites in the country 
there are however only 31000 known or suspected hazardous waste 
sites on epas list of candidates for superfund cleanup 
the agency has 1219 sites on a priority list for cleanup under 
superfund 
epa concedes that it is ruling out more sites for superfund but 
maintains that it is doing a better job on site decisions and is 
devoting more staff time to that task 
yes weve processed more but weve made better decisions 
said henry longest director of epas office of emergency and 
remedial response 
rep mike synar dokla and chairman of the subcommittee 
alleged that epa was pursuing a policy of deferring enforcement 
decisions to the states even though the agency officially had 
discarded that approach 
by consciously limiting the number of sites which will be 
addressed through the superfund program epa is continually shifting 
more and more cleanup responsibilities to other federal programs 
which have fewer financial resources and safeguards and to states 
which are struggling to cope with the problems they already face 
synar said 
last december the epa asked for comment on a proposed policy of 
turning over control of superfund sites to states the outcry was so 
great that epa disbanded the working group studying the issue 
epas acting assistant administrator for solid waste and 
emergency repsonse jonathan z cannon said the agency was working 
within the constraints imposed by budgets and the law which 
requires a certain deference to state agencies 
our job is to prioritize and to do the best job that we can

president bush on tuesday rejected criticism 
from members of congress and environmentalists who say hes 
stalling efforts to combat global warming 
environmental policy bush said cannot be driven by the 
extreme 
the presidents defense came as three senators chastized his 
administration for not endorsing a resolution sought by many 
european countries at a global warming conference in the 
netherlands the resolution calls for specific curbs on 
greenhouse gases by the end of the century 
the white house issued a statement later tuesday saying that the 
united states had agreed on a compromise declaration at the 
netherlands conference that says global warming pollutants should 
be stabilized as soon as possible 
according to administration sources us negotiators felt they 
could accept that wording because it doesnt tie any nation to 
specific levels of pollution reduction nor stabilize levels by a 
specific year 
the revised declaration notes only that in the view of many 
industrialized nations but not necessarily all nations carbon 
dioxide emissions should be stabilized by 2000 said one us 
official asking that he not be identified 
were not willing to agree to a set time we did not sign on 
to anything mentioning the year 2000 said deputy presidential 
press secretary stephen hart 
originally many of the conference participants had sought 
commitments to freeze greenhouse gas emissions at present levels by 
2000 a position the bush administration has rejected that 
prompted sharp criticism from some members of congress and 
environmentalists 
president bush promised to confront the greenhouse effect now 
what were seeing is the whitewash effect sen albert gore 
dtenn said in remarks on the senate floor 
bush also was criticized by daniel becker of the sierra club 
the president of the united states who wants to be the 
environmental president promised to lead us on this issue of 
global warming becker said but hes leading us in the wrong 
direction backward 
bush asked about the issue at a white house news conference 
defended his strategy of moving slowly in making a commitment to 
specific reductions in greenhouse gases 
the us scientific community he said is in the lead in 
focusing on the question of what effect pollutants primarily from 
the burning of fossil fuels will have on world temperatures over 
the next 50 years 
but you cant take a policy and drive it to the extreme and 
say to every country around the world that you arent going to 
grow economically at all the president said 
the administration has been divided for months on how 
aggressively it should pursue specific commitments to getting 
worldwide reductions in global warming pollutants especially 
carbon dioxide of which the united states is the largest source 
a major concern among some presidential advisers has been over 
cost 
significant reductions of greenhouse pollutants will require 
curbing the use of fossil fuels meaning more fuelefficient 
automobiles and increased energy conservation according to the 
environmental protection agency 
we believe in a reduction of carbon dioxide but were not 
prepared to say by what time and by what level epa administrator 
william reilly head of the us delegation in the netherlands 
said as the conference opened monday 
reilly has said repeatedly that the united states believes its 
too early to commit to specific curbs of greenhouse gases and that 
such matters are best worked out by the international panel on 
climate change in a series of meeting beginning in february 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine on tuesday 
compared bushs attitude toward dealing with global warming with 
former president reagans eightyear opposition to dealing with 
acid rain conceding pollution curbs could be costly mitchell said 
that delay has a cost of its own 
gore and sen timothy wirth dcolo two of the senates 
strongest advocates for immediate action to combat global warming 
accused bush of reneging on a campaign promise to address the issue 
promptly 
wirth said the administration is clearly out of the 
mainstream on global warming and has has demonstrated at the 
netherlands conference that its not a leader but a delinquent 
partner 
the overwhelming preponderance of evidence is that we are 
changing our atmosphere the world is getting warmer and we ought 
to move now wirth said it is not a question of if the globe 
is warming but how much and how fast 
nicholas fedoruk a spokesman for washingtonbased environmental 
action foundation said the united states is the largest 
contributor to the release of global warming gases and should be 
leading efforts to solve the problem 
instead this country allied itself with some of the worlds 
biggest polluters to stymie meaningful action fedoruk said

president bush said tuesday that theres room 
in politics for differing viewpoints on abortion and that the issue 
is absolutely not the most important one for him 
on an election day when the issue of a womans right to an 
abortion figured as a major theme in gubernatorial campaigns in new 
jersey and virginia bush also said he does not believe voters cast 
their ballots based on that issue alone 
i dont believe most voters are singleissue voters there is 
no evidence to support that none at all he said citing data by 
his campaign pollster robert teeter showing that voters consider 
abortion the ninth to 14th most important issue before them 
i think our party is broad enough to contain differing views 
on this and i think the democratic party is bush told a 
white house news conference its so personal i just come down 
more on the side of life look i dont fault people who view 
this differently theres plenty of room for difference 
bushs comments brought quick reaction from a leading prochoice 
advocate on capitol hill rep barbara boxer dcalif said it 
appeared the president was attempting to moderate his views and 
was trying to distance himself from the radical antichoice 
platform on which he ran 
she said also that hes got a bit of a minirevolution going 
on among prochoice republicans in congress 
in the meantime members of congress and activist groups that 
want abortions outlawed have hammered on bush because they are 
suspicious that he is not as strongly committed to their cause as 
his predecessor ronald reagan 
acknowledging the heated opinions bush appeared told reporters 
abortion divides 
but he also said we have room in our party for people that 
feel one way prolife or prochoice democratic party the same 
way 
nationwide activism by prochoice supporters has put an 
increasingly bright spotlight on the abortion controversy since the 
supreme courts decision in july giving states increased powers to 
legislate on abortion 
bush insisted he has no intention of changing my position 
is it the most important issue for me absolutely not bush 
said 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said bush was wrong to think abortion was not a top priority among 
voters 
hes going to find it out in 1990 and if he stays on a 
collision course with the american people hell find it out 
personally in 1992 
bush recently vetoed the 1576 billion package for the 
departments of education labor and health and huan services 
because it included an abortionfinancing provision written by 
boxer 
the provision would have expanded the use of medicaid funds to 
pay for abortions for rape or incest victims going beyond current 
law which allows medicaid funds to be spent only in cases where 
the mothers life is endangered 
bush also has vowed to veto a 144 billion foreign aid bill for 
fiscal 1990 because it would send 15 million to the un 
population fund 
the agency carries on programs in china where its opponents say 
severe official restrictions on family size have led to forced 
abortions and sterilizations 
it supports compulsory abortion he said of the un 
program i am not going to do that 
bush commented as voters in virginia and new jersey went to the 
polls to elect governors after campaigns that dwelt heavily on the 
candidates positions on abortion 
in virginia democratic gubernatorial candidate douglas wilder 
attacked republican marshall coleman in a series of tv ads for his 
stance against the right to an abortion 
the abortion controversy continued to erupt nationwide as bush 
made his comments with the national conference of catholic bishops 
saying tuesday in baltimore that no catholic can responsibly take a 
prochoice stand on abortion and they urged public officials to 
fight the right to an abortion

barbara bush said tuesday she is keeping 
silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy 
whichever way i go and detract from her work on illiteracy 
the homeless hunger and aids 
i think that should be left to the people who are courageous 
enough number one to run for office and number two who can do 
something about it she told three reporters at a white house 
reception for disabled award winners 
asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections notably 
the governors races tuesday in new jersey and virginia she said 
that she is not a singleissue person and indicated voters 
should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter 
i think people ought to be thinking about fiscal 
responsibility and past records and looking at the man as a 
whole or the woman as a whole she said im not a single issue 
man or woman she said 
president bush told a news conference tuesday that he believes 
americans do not vote on the single issue of abortion he recently 
vetoed legislation that would have allowed federal funds to be 
spent for abortions for poor victims of rape or incest 
asked why she will not give her own position on abortion which 
has become an increasingly polarizing issue in the wake of the 
supreme courts july decision giving states greater leeway to 
restrict it mrs bush said it does nothing but cause 
controversy whichever way i go i want people to be interested in 
my projects such as working for literacy and the homeless 
mrs bush announced in february that she would not speak out on 
controversial policy issues after she told a reporter that she 
favored a ban on semiautomatic weapons putting her in conflict 
with her husbands public position 
the first lady has spoken out on some issues of concern to 
teenage women and says we need a lot of education to tell 
these girls that there are opportunities out there for them that 
the door will be closed if they go ahead and have babies its very 
old fashioned i know 
after the supreme court in july gave states expanded powers to 
restrict abortion bush lauded the ruling and mrs bush said only 
i go with my president 
mrs bush also said that she would like to go to the 
mediterranean superpower summit next month if soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs wife raisa also goes 
she said it had not been decided if she would go but that im 
one who loves to travel 
on another issue mrs bush said her eyes are still irritated 
from the thyroid condition she suffers known as graves disease 
she said the steroid she has been prescribed to treat the 
ailment prednisone has made her gain back some of the weight she 
lost earlier in the year 
im fighting a small problem weight she conceded adding 
that she swims a mile a day to keep in shape 
then she chided herself for complaining about her medication at 
an event designed to honor people who have overcome major 
disabilities 
of all the places in america to complain about taking 
prednisone this is not the party to complain about it she said 
as she stood among several wheelchairbound award recipients 
the 1989 victory awards were bestowed by the national 
rehabilitation hospital to people who overcame physical obstacles 
while making contributions to society 
among the award recipients were one chosen by the governor of 
each state and several selected by the national rehabilitation 
hospital a private 160bed institution in washington

twentyeight inspectors check the safety of 
shipments of hazardous chemicals that cross the country by rail 
too few to ensure federal safety regulations are being obeyed the 
general accounting office told congress tuesday 
its like trying to stop an elephant with a fly swatter 
kenneth m mead the gaos chief transportation expert told a house 
subcommittee you try to stop all these tank cars and theres 
another 500000 cars right behind them 
mead said that theres no way the federal government can afford 
to hire enough inspectors to look at all 11 million rail carloads 
of hazardous chemicals which move each year but that a doubling of 
this workforce would be reasonable 
there is simply too much of a workload on these people he 
said 
the gao in a report to be issued next week concluded the 
federal railroad administration hasnt done a good job of running 
the governments hazardous materials inspection program 
the agency is authorized to have 34 inspectors but only 28 of 
those positions are filled and the people filling the slots have an 
average age of 50 mead told the energy and commerce subcommittee on 
transportation and hazardous materials that means were going to 
have some attrition soon decreasing the pool of experienced 
inspectors he said 
in addition he said inspectors havent been going after 
highrisk shippers and railroads and havent received adequate 
guidance about their procedures because theres been no direction 
from the top 
gilbert carmichael the new head of the railroad administration 
told the panel the gao accurately described shortcomings and wed 
be wise to include the recommendations of the gaos report in 
discussions of ways to improve the way the fra does its job 
energy and commerce chairman john dingell dmich called the 
gaos conclusions a truly frightening picture of the dangers to

dingell blamed the problem on a longslumbering bureaucracy 
that grew cold and complacent during an eightyear dismantling of 
federal safety activities 
the reagan administration left its successors an unforgiveable 
legacy of mismanagement and inefficiency and then made sure ther 
werent enough resources to clean up the mess dingell said 
the chairman of the subcommittee rep thomas luken dohio

the house approved a bill tuesday that would 
expand everglades national park in florida by 110000 acres to 
protect it from encroaching commercial development 
established in 1947 the everglades park preserves the 
subtropical region at floridas southern tip certain water quality 
and flows must exist to maintain the parks extensive freshwater and 
saltwater ecosystems 
increasing development in the region has affected the waterways 
and hurt plant and animal populations for example the number of 
wading birds has declined by 93 percent naturalists say 
the bill which was passed on voice vote and sent to the senate 
would allow the interior department to acquire lands and interest in 
land through donation purchase or exchange 
the state of florida has said it would donate 35000 acres under 
the bill it must pay 20 percent of the cost of acquiring the 
remaining 75000 with the federal government spending 80 percent 
the addition would amount to about 79 percent of the parks 
current area 1398937 acres 
the measure would prohibit most use of airboats in the park but 
people who were using them on jan 1 could contiue to use them under 
rules to be adopted by the interior department 
the bill directs the army corps of engineers to modify water 
delivery to the park based on the findings of an experimental 
program authorized by congress in 1984 
the corps also would construct flood control and drainage works 
in areas adversely affected by the modifications property owners 
would be compensated if their crops or lands were damaged 
in another provision of the measure the interior department is 
to submit to congress a feasibility study for redesignating the fort 
jefferson national monument in the dry tortuga islands off key 
west as a national park 
the congressional budget office has estimated that the bill 
wpould require spending of 79 million over the next five years

a harvard law professor urged senators tuesday 
to reject the nomination of president bushs cousin as a federal 
appeals judge saying the appointment would violate the nations 
antinepotism law 
he would not have gotten this nomination if he were not the 
presidents cousin alan m dershowitz told a senate judiciary 
committee hearing on the nomination of john m walker 
walker 48 is a district court judge in new york 
the committee is not expected to vote for several weeks on 
whether to recommend confirmation by the full senate to the us 2nd 
circuit court of appeals such a delay is normal and the nomination 
has not drawn opponents other than dershowitz 
walker got this appointment because of family connections 
dershowitz said alleging that it violates the antinepotism 
statute both in language and in spirit 
the 1967 law bars naming relatives to government jobs dershowitz 
said he believes it applies to the walker nomination but told 
reporters in a hallway afterward that there was room for 
disagreement on that point 
he said that even if the law does not apply to a judicial 
nomination bushs nomination of walker violates the spirit of the 
law 
the elegantly dressed walker who bears a remote resemblance to 
his cousin sat a few feet away with an impassive expression most of 
the time as dershowitz described him as an average judge once 
he shook his head impatiently during dershowitzs testimony 
dershowitz alleged that walker once held an improper conversation 
with an attorney in a lawsuit stemming from the claus von bulow 
society murder trial 
walker denied the allegation

a white man who said he shot a black 
panhandler out of fear for his life was given a suspended jail 
sentence after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor homicide charge 
clifford smith 40 was also placed on probation for two years in 
the 1986 shooting death of jimmy jackson 42 smith fired when 
jackson approached a pickup driven by smith at a red light in 
birmingham 
smiths 1987 trial ended in a mistrial when the jury deadlocked 
102 in favor of convicting him of the same charge he pleaded guilty 
to monday in a plea bargain at jefferson couty circuit court 
the sentence drew criticism tuesday from attorney henry l 
penick who is representing jacksons brother in a 4 million 
wrongful death suit against smith the civil lawsuit is pending 
penick said he was outraged and disturbed by what he 
considered a very light sentence certainly in comparison to the 
nature of the crime 
it is precisely a bernhard goetz case said penick in 
fact it is more heinous than that case in the sense there was no 
allegation that jimmy jackson was trying to rob mr smith he was 
merely asking for a quarter 
goetz who shot four young black men on a new york subway in 
december 1984 said he feared he was about to be robbed he was 
cleared of attempted murder and assault charges but was sentenced to 
one year in jail and fined 500 for illegal gun possession 
in the birmingham case penick said the prosecution and sentence 
would have been harsher if the unarmed victim had been white and the 
gunman black 
i know both the judge and the district attorney to be fair 
persons but i do not understand how they came to agree on this 
particular sentence he said 
bill neumann deputy district attorney denied any racial 
motivation behind the plea bargain with smith he said the 
prosecution had problems finding witnesses and noted that a 1987 
jury deadlocked with 10 wanting to convict smith of no more than 
criminally negligent homicide the other two jurors favored a more 
serious manslaughter conviction 
based on the evidence we felt we could put on with the 
witnesses we had the age of the case and the jury voting the way 
they did before neumann said it seemed better to make the offer 
to smith 
smith contended he shot jackson because he feared for his life 
he said jackson had approached him previously and when smith refused 
to give him money jackson tried to take the keys from the ignition 
of his vehicle 
on the day he shot jackson smith said jackson approached him 
yelling i remember you i remember you smith said he fired a 
warning shot at the ground then fired again when jackson kept 
advancing 
smith has been on nonpaid leave from his job as a us postal 
service mechanic since the shooting one of his attorneys said he 
now will start the process of getting reinstated 
im glad its over smith said outside the courtroom

fourteen activist aids groups on tuesday urged 
an illinois drug manufacturer to cut the price of a drug used to 
prevent a form of pneumonia that is the biggest killer of people 
with aids 
the coalition in a letter to lyphomed inc of rosemont ill 
said the price of about 100 for a monthly dose of aerosolized 
pentamidine is too expensive for many people with aids or infected 
with hiv the virus that causes aids 
the groups said that while recognizing that pricing is based on 
more than just the research and development costs of a particular 
drug the ultimate price must also be within reason and should not 
deny access to thousands 
they noted that unreasonably high prices borne by the federal 
government for these therapies through medicaid and other federal 
programs may spur calls for broader regulation of drug prices 
the groups asked for a meeting with lyphomed officials to discuss 
pricing of aerosolized pentamidine which the company markets as 
nebupent 
lyphomed officials were out of the office tuesday afternoon and 
could not be reached for comment 
the aerosol version of pentamidine was approved by the food and 
drug administration in june federal health officials recommended 
aggressive use of the therapy that protects people infected with 
aids from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which kills more than 60 
percent of people with aids 
a similar coalition of aids activists had earlier pressed for a 
price cut by burroughs welcome co which makes azt the only 
governmentapproved drug that attacks the aids virus 
in september burroughs wellcome announced a 20 percent reduction 
in the wholesale price of azt cutting the cost of an annual course 
of treatment from about 8000 to about 6500 
among the groups signing the letter were aids action council 
aids coalition to unleash power american foundation for aids 
research american association of physicians for human rights 
people with aids health group the human rights campaign fund and 
gay mens health crisis 
the letter was also sent to top federal health officials and 
members of congress

the united states and soviet union will 
begin exchanging information about their chemicalweapon arsenals 
next month and likely will conduct trial inspections in may a us 
official said tuesday 
the exchange of data and inspections are initial steps toward a 
treaty to sharply reduce and possibly eliminate the weapons 
president bush and soviet minister eduard a shevardnadze called 
for production bans in recent speeches to the un general assembly 
the us official attending an arms control seminar at wye 
plantation on the eastern shore of maryland estimated us 
stockpiles at about 30000 tons 
the official who spoke to reporters under rules that barred 
identifying him said the soviets claim of possessing 50000 tons 
of poison gas was widely understated 
he said their arsenal could be five or six times as big 
the superpowers apparently working without major disagreements 
hope they can reach an accord that will prompt 40 nations meeting in 
geneva to adopt a worldwide ban 
another 27 countries are attending the geneva talks as observers 
those countries include iran syria libya and several others 
suspected of having chemical weapons programs 
the us official estimated 20 to 25 nations have mastered the 
technology to produce chemical weapons and that about half actually 
possess them 
only the united states and the soviet union have acknowleged 
chemical weapons stockpiles 
however us official have said that iran and iraq both used 
poison gas in their persian gulf war libya was accused of nearing 
production at a plant near tripoli 
the us official said the soviets have proposed exchanging 
information dec 20 in washington and moscow while the united 
states suggested dec 14 in geneva 
the soviets meanwhile proposed a single inspection in may of 
either a production or storage facility the united states suggested 
an inspection of both types of facilities the us official said 
the inspections which the soviets call visitations would be 
conducted by monitors from the other country 
on another point the soviets have proposed drawing up a list of 
60 countries whose approval of a treaty would trigger the complete 
elimination of all us and soviet chemical weapons the official 
said 
the united states seeking a more airtight arrangement wants 
all countries in geneva to approve a ban until they do bush said 
in his un speech the united states would retain 2 percent of its 
chemical weapons all of them the modern binary type still in 
production 
despite these differences we find the soviet and us 
positions very close the official said in an optimistic account 
of ongoing negotiations in geneva

the house on tuesday approved a 34 billion 
program for the coast guard in fiscal 1990 including provisions 
designed to crack down on alcohol abuse among merchant seamen 
the bill approved 3833 and sent to the senate contains several 
provisions that address the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska last 
spring 
the house was to vote wednesday on another bill expedited by the 
exxon accident oil spill liability 
the coast guard measure would require the agency to review the 
criminal records of applicants for new or renewed licenses 
registrations and other needed documents if theres enough evidence 
of alcohol abuse the agency could withhold papers until the problem 
is corrected 
the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 dumping 11 million gallons 
of crude oil into prince william sound investigators were told that 
the tanker captain had been drinking and wasnt on the bridge when 
the accident occurred 
by voice vote the house added a requirement that the coast guard 
conduct random drug tests of its employees 
the bill calls for new research and development of techniques for 
cleaning up oil spills it also authorizes the coast guard to spend 
24 million for advanced aircraft radar to detect drug smugglers and 
develop new procedures for seizing vessels on which drugs are 
detected 
much coast guard activity involves policing recreational boaters 
but some need more policing than others 
the bill requires the agency to identify how much its spending 
to provide security for president bushs fishing and boating 
activities at his summer home in kennebunkport maine 
the oil spill liability coming up wednesday sets limits on the 
amount an oil company or oil carrier would have to pay if a spill 
occurs 
heated floor debate is expected over an amendment proposed by 
reps george miller dcalif and gerry studds dmass that would 
allow states to set stricter liability laws than the federal 
statute as written the bill would require a single law the 
federal one

a national early warning system for 
earthquakes could provide emergency planners with crucial extra 
seconds in a disaster a seismologist with the us geological 
survey said tuesday 
the federal agency has proposed a national network of 150 
interconnected seismometers to detect ground motion and relay 
immediate information about earthquakes including predictions of 
when and where the most shaking will occur 
the network would issue bulletins telling emergency planners how 
many seconds they had before shock waves from the quake would reach 
them those seconds could be enough to turn off power systems issue 
public warnings and make emergency response plans before 
communications are cut off said thomas heaton of the geological 
surveys office in asadena calif 
the bulletins would help planners know where emergency services 
would be needed most and provide an estimate of what kind of damage 
the quake would cause 
the network also would estimate the probability that an 
earthquake is a foreshock and would be followed by another bigger 
quake heaton said in a briefing for science writers at cornell 
university 
heaton said early warning systems are used in japan to predict 
tidal waves after an earthquake and to turn off gas and 
transportation systems when a quake occurs one system shuts down 
japans highspeed bullet train to prevent an accident if the 
trains tracks were bent in an earthquake 
although there are 1600 seismograph stations in the united 
states they are intended to locate earthquakes even very small 
ones and not to provide information about them the existing 
system records only the up and down motion of the earth not its 
sidetoside shaking and can measure only a limited range of shock 
waves heaton said major quakes like last months california 
quake are off the scale 
the existing system is also very slow heaton said the 
information it provides is typically one or two days behind and in 
a large sequence of shocks that delay could become as long as 
several months 
heaton said a detection system would not have reduced deaths in 
the california earthquake but might have been able to reduce some 
injuries by giving people enough warning to get out of the way of 
falling objects 
we need to use whatever creative strategies there are to 
minimize the risk he said 
after the california earthquake three seismometers were 
installed to measure aftershocks from the quake the seismometers 
sent about a 20second warning of aftershocks to emergency workers 
who were digging through rubble 
the nuclear regulatory commission has agreed to fund 60 of the 
centers recommended by the geological survey in the eastern and 
central part of the united states at a cost of about 5 million no 
funding has yet been found for the remaining centers heaton said 
many people have the impression that whatever can be done is 
being done heaton said that is far from the true situation 
heatons talk was part of a fourday briefing at cornell 
university sponsored by the council for the advancement of science

a guerrilla group said its 
members mistakenly killed a selfemployed tiler thinking he was a 
member of northern irelands security forces 
the outlawed irish peoples liberation organization issued a 
statement after police said the victim robert burns 49 had no 
connection with the army or police 
burns was fatally wounded by assailants who fired through the 
front door of his house in derriaghy 
the irish peoples liberation organization is a breakaway group 
from the irish republican army also outlawed in both britain and 
ireland both are fighting to unite northern ireland a british 
province where protestants outnumber roman catholics 32 with the 
predominantly catholic republic of ireland 
in another development police ordered an urgent review of 
security for northern irelands senior police officers after an ira 
bombing monday of the home of a chief in the royal ulster 
constabulary 
assistant chief constable david mellor 52 had just left the 
living room when the bomb exploded under a bulletproof window 
inches behind the armchair where he had been reading mellors wife 
and two young daughters were nearby but were not injured 
the ira said its guerrillas placed a 3pound bomb at the window 
it issued a statement saying we deliberately placed a small 
charge only because we were aware of the young children in the 
house otherwise we could undoubtedly have guaranteed mellors death 
with a larger charge 
police are concerned that the guerrillas were able to breach 
mellors security arrangements that included a full alarm system 
with special lights 
eight royal ulster constabular officers including a chief 
superintendent and two superintendents have been killed by the ira 
this year 
northern ireland secretary peter brooke said tuesday there was no 
change in the governments policy toward terrorists but stood by his

industrial nations which produce 
twothirds of the gas emissions associated with global warming were 
still divided at the end of a conference tuesday on how to reduce 
them 
at the twoday conference of 68 nations on ways to slow or halt 
dangerous climatic changes the united states japan and soviet 
union refused to commit themselves to stabilizing emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other gases by the year 2000 
environmentalists said the reservations to the final declaration 
were a setback to efforts against the greenhouse effect the 
gradual warming of earths atmosphere 
less than six months ago in paris president bush talked of the 
urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions now the white house 
has sabotaged the first international effort to make good on the 
presidents words said brooks yeager of the national audubon 
society a us environmental group 
the meetings final declaration said in the view of many 
industrialized nations such stabilization of carbon dioxide 
emissions should be achieved as a first step at the latest by the 
year 2000 
it said a stable development of the world economy remained 
essential and urged industrial nations to study the feasibility of 
achieving targets to reduce carbon dioxide emission levels by 
the year 2005 
william k reilly chief administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency told reporters the united states is not one of 
the countries that has agreed to go so far while stabilization 
is necessary we must closely analyze the means to achieve that 
reilly said the proposed measures could only be implemented at 
great cost it is estimated that hundreds of billions of dollars 
would be needed to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and 
industrial plants around the world 
in washington the white house issued a statement saying the 
united states had agreed to a compromise declaration saying the 
pollutants should be stabilized as soon as possible 
administration sources said us negotiators felt they could 
accept that wording because it did not tie any nation to specific 
levels of pollution reduction or require levels to be stabilized by 
a specific year 
one us official speaking privately said the revised 
declaration noted only that in the view of many industrialized 
nations but not necessarily all carbon dioxide emissions should 
be stabilized by 2000 
stephen hart deputy presidential press secretary said were 
not willing to agree to a set time we did not sign on to anything 
mentioning the year 2000 
several developing nations including india and china voiced 
reservations at the conference 
the netherlands west germany and the scandinavian countries had 
teamed with canada in an unsuccessful effort to get unanimous 
approval of such a commitment 
the dutch sponsors of the conference and others also pushed to 
set a level at which the emissions of ozonethreatening gases would 
be frozen by the end of the century 
klaus toepfer the west german environment minister took a less 
bleak view 
reilly and the others will take the message home that more is 
expected of them toepfer told reporters that means well have 
a better starting point for the next conferences 
the unsponsored intergovernmental panel on climate change is 
to meet in washington in february and the second world climate 
conference is to be held in late 1990 
reilly said the united states is enthusiastically supporting 
those meetings and did not want to excessively influence them by 
committing itself to a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions at 
the noordwijk conference 
those emissions along with those of chlorofluorocarbons methane 
and nitrous oxides are believed to be the major cause of the rise 
in atmospheric temperatures 
about 65 percent of the emissions originate from industrialized 
nations in the northern hemisphere according to a recent report by 
the worldwatch institute in washington 
the dutch environment ministry said the united states produces 
237percent of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions 
scientists say the greenhouse effect could eventually turn 
subtropical zones into deserts and coastal nations could face 
massive inundations

women are running for the first time in 
parliamentary elections wednesday which are the first in 22 years 
and will formalize the arab kingdoms separation from the 
israelioccupied west bank 
the threeweek campaign was among the freest in the arab world 
conducted by nearly 650 candidates embracing islamic 
fundamentalists tribal sheiks communists businessmen former 
intelligence agents and former political prisoners 
only a few rallies were held tuesday but thousands of banners 
still fluttered and newspapers were crammed with appeals to the 
877000 voters the daily al dustour alone carried 222 political ads 
in its 30 pages 
a interior ministry official said tuesday night that 649 
candidates were registered jordanian television put the figure at 
648 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood whose platform includes a 
more islamic government and destruction of israel attracted the 
largest crowds to rallies for its 26 parliament candidates 
political analysts said it might win 12 to 20 of the 80 seats 
but predictions were being made in a void because of the long period 
without elections a lack of opinion polls and numerous candidates 
in each race 
despite martial law and a 33yearold ban on political parties 
king husseins government allowed political groups to run slates 
openly for the first time since 1956 they held rallies and debates 
that attracted thousands of jordanians 
i think this is the most important election jordan has ever 
experienced said former foreign minister taher masri who 
resigned as deputy prime minister to run for parliament in amman 
the capital 
the unusually free election follows two major events jordans 
worst economic crisis in decades which led to riots in april and 
husseins rununciation of claims to the west bank in july 1988 in 
favor of the palestine liberation organization 
jordan is leaving the west bank out of national elections for the 
first time since 1950 and that will help formalize the division 
israel captured the west bank in the june war of 1967 two months 
after the last election 
loss of the territory which held half the 60 seats in the old 
parliament made national elections impossible hussein suspended 
the legislature in 1974 then revived it a decade later 
because women were given the right to vote only in 1974 this is 
the first general election in which they can participate twelve are 
running for parliament 
the last parliament was largely passive in recent years but 
earlier legislatures have been so independent that kings often have 
suspended them 
parliament must approve all laws has the power to override a 
royal veto and can dismiss cabinets with no organized governing 
party the government must forge alliances to get its proposals 
through 
it will be a more important parliament than before said 
masri the former foreign minister 
kamel abu jaber a political scientist noted that jordan had 
changed dramatically since the last election only one jordanian in 
20 went beyond high school in 1967 but the rate today is greater 
than one in three he said

the church of englands general synod voted in 
favor of the principle of women priests on tuesday the first step 
toward possible ordination of women by the state church 
members of the general synod passed by a simple majority the 
first clause of a proposed amendment to canon law to permit 
ordination of women 
it reads it shall be lawful for the general synod to make 
provision by canon for enabling a woman to be ordained to the office 
of priest if she otherwise satisfies the requirements of canon law 
as to the persons who may be ordained as priests 
nothing in this measure shall make it lawful for a woman to be 
consecrated to the office of bishop 
the change came on the first day of a twoday debate and was 
supported by all three branches of the synod the churchs 
parliament the bishops voted 3017 in favor the clergy 14985 in 
favor and the lay members 14478 in favor 
it went better than we thought said margaret orr deas 
executive secretary of the movement for the ordination of women 
we are very pleased 
the issue now goes to the 43 dioceses for discussion by ordinary 
members of the church this is expected to start next year 
the question will probably not return to the general synod for a 
final vote until 1992 when a twothirds majority will be required 
the general synod threw out two controversial amendments one to 
create a separate church allowing only male priests the other to 
allow a parish within a diocese that ordained women to transfer to a 
diocese which did not 
about 1200 women have been ordained in anglican churches mainly 
in the united states canada and new zealand it has been a major 
point of contention between anglicans and roman catholics in their 
ecumenical encounters 
the church of england has debated the issue for two decades some 
opponents among the clergy and laity say they will break away if 
women are ordained 
at the start of debate archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
said he would vote to allow discussions on the ordination of women 
to proceed in the dioceses despite remaining undecided on the basic 
principle of women priests 
i judge that the dioceses may surprise us by what they bring 
forward he said 
explaining his dilemma runcie said on one hand he believed 
theological arguments could justify ordaining women on the other 
he said women priests would have a detrimental effect on church 
unity as both he and pope john paul ii said during his visit to 
rome in september 
i cannot deny the serious obstacle which this move has created 
there he said 
the bishop of durham the right rev david jenkins drew loud 
applause when he said ordination of women to the priesthood is 
not the end of the world if the church of englands making a 
mistake were the end of the world the world would have ended long 
ago 
the bishop of portsmouth the rt rev timothy bavin said he 
would have to consider resigning if the legislation was finally 
passed despite being a supporter of women priests 
he said he did not want to have to choose between favoring 
opponents or supporters among his congregations 
canon frances briscoe one of 500 women deacons anxious to become 
priests told the synod the vast majority are not a regiment of 
strident feminists but are dedicated women who quietly and 
efficiently get on with the job within the confines of the present 
strictures

a member of the medellin drug cartel extradited 
last month from colombia was sentenced tuesday to 15 years in prison 
and fined 25000 for his 5yearold drug conviction 
bernardo pelaez roldan 44 fled to his homeland after his 1983 
indictment forfeiting a 200000 bond he was convicted in absentia 
in detroit in 1984 of conspiracy to possess with intent to 
distribute 660 pounds of cocaine 
defense attorney richard lustig said he wasnt surprised pelaez 
received the maximum federal penalty but contended his clients 
rights were ignored 
pawns like bernardo are being given to the public because of 
the hysteria over drugs lustig said 
at tuesdays hearing lustig asked that pelaez be returned to 
colombia because of improper extradition procedures and that the 
time he has served in prison since his 1983 indictment be credited 
to his sentence 
the defense motion for credit for time served is premature 
us district judge ralph m freeman said adding that such a motion 
must go to the justice department and not to the sentencing court 
in 1987 the colombian supreme court ruled that pelaez couldnt 
be extradited to the united states because the charges against him 
predated an extradition agreement between the two countries pelaez 
had been incarcerated for 22 months in colombia pending that ruling 
but pelaez was extradited under presidential orders independent 
of colombian courts lustig said 
president virgilio barco revived extraditions to the united 
states as part of the emergency measures against drug traffickers 
imposed aug 18 after the assassination of a presidential candidate 
who was an outspoken foe of the drug trade 
six people have since been extradited pelaez is the only one 
tried and convicted according to the us justice department 
freeman said he will rule nov 22 on the extradition question 
the government portrayed pelaez as a major money launderer for 
the medellin cartel which is believed to supply 80 percent of the 
cocaine sold in the united states 
testimony in the 1984 trial revealed pelaez was responsible for 
shipments of cocaine valued at 6 million in 1981 and 1982 but 
lustig maintained his client was merely a courier 
he did something wrong and admitted to it lustig said but 
if i might use the term he was a flunky 
lustig said he will appeal the conviction and pelaezs 
extradition

financially ailing braniff inc dismissed 
many of its 1800 remaining employees and stranded some passengers 
tuesday after the airline abruptly canceled its last 46 roundtrip 
flights 
a severe cash shortage shortcircuited the companys 
reorganization plan and forced it to halt passenger service as of 
midnight monday said chairman william g mcgee after an emergency 
meeting of the board of directors 
braniff which sought protection from creditors sept 28 while it 
developed a reorganization plan under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws is looking for a buyer officials said 
many of its remaining employees were being dismissed tuesday 
said spokeswoman sandy smith 
the situation is confusing to say the least ms smith said 
most people i assume are losing their jobs right away im 
not getting a lot of information from our executives 
mcgee said in his announcement that employees would be notified 
of their status individually 
before its filing braniff operated 256 roundtrip flights and 
had employed as many as 4800 people 
tom volz senior vice president of marketing said discussions 
were under way with potential investors 
the immediate objective is to attempt to continue 
reorganization under the chapter 11 code as a viable charter 
entity he said there are no plans at this point to give 
consideration to liquidation 
however edward starkman an airline analyst with painewebber in 
new york said he doubted a buyer would be found for the entire 
airline and that braniff would probably be liquidated 
i dont think youre really buying much if you bought the whole 
thing he said some assets would be of interest 
the cancellations surprised and angered pilots and other 
employees and left a few customers frustrated in orlando fla 
kansas city mo dallas los angeles and other major airports 
were all in shock said jim hamilton a braniff pilot based 
in dallas i didnt expect something like this to happen we were 
hoping that someone would buy braniff and want to run it but maybe 
there was nothing left to buy 
passengers calling to check about flights were advised to try 
other airlines who may honor tickets in some cases braniff 
ticketing and checkin counters were unstaffed 
passengers were getting varying responses from other carriers 
eastern airlines was taking braniff customers on a standby basis 
united was giving braniff ticketholders a 50 percent discount on a 
fullfare coach ticket 
there were no long lines of passengers as there were in 
september when braniff filed for bankruptcy protection 
i think the word was out and people were booking elsewhere 
said dave napoli assistant general manager at the kansas city 
airport 
the carrier had been operating from week to week relying on 
emergency infusions of cash approved by the us bankruptcy court in 
orlando in its filing braniff listed debt of 347 million and 
assets of 326 million 
braniff filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 nearly 1 billion 
in debt it started flying again in 1984 as a lowcost nofrills 
carrier the company was acquired by bia acquisitions an investor 
group formed by painewebber inc in june 1988 and shifted most of 
its flight operations to kansas city from dallas 
it moved its corporate headquarters from dallas to orlando early 
this year and had ambitious expansion plans but it kept getting 
deeper into debt

the justice department said tuesday it wont 
show a house subcommittee a legal opinion broadening fbi arrest 
powers overseas because congress is no more entitled to see it than 
the public 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the opinion 
stating that fbi agents have legal authority to seize fugitives 
overseas without permission of a foreign government is considered 
private legal advice for the bureau that wont be made public 
the opinions author assistant attorney general william p barr 
is scheduled to be questioned about it on wednesday by members of 
the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
asked why the opinion which is not classified was being 
withheld from members of the subcommittee runkel replied why 
would we treat the committee any differently than the news media or 
the general public 
bill barr will go up and talk about it and answer questions 
but its in keeping with department policy not to make the opinion 
public runkel said its our view that its a confidential 
legal opinion 
runkel argued that the justice department is not privy to legal 
opinions produced for congress by house and senate legal counsel 
the justice departments office of legal counsel which barr 
heads issued the june 21 opinion in response to a request for 
advice from the fbi 
rep don edwards dcalif the subcommittee chairman expressed 
incredulity over runkels statement his panel was not entitled to 
see the document 
maybe that department of justice needs more experience it 
needs an education about how the government is supposed to work in a 
free society edwards said and our hearing tomorrow i hope 
will guide them along that path 
besides approving the justice departments budget edwards noted 
that the judiciary committee by law is required to oversee its 
operations 
thats what we take the oath of office to do edwards said 
barr was summoned along with associate deputy fbi director oliver 
b revell to answer questions about the opinion which sparked 
veiled criticism last month from secretary of state james baker iii 
baker called it a very narrow legal opinion based on 
consideration only of domestic united states laws the secretary 
said it did not take into account international law nor did it 
weigh the presidents constituitnal responsibliity to carry out the 
foreign policy of the united states 
the document entitled authority of the fbi to override 
customary or other international law in the course of 
extraterritorial law enforcement activities reverses a 1980 legal 
opinion that the fbi could not arrest a fugitive without obtaining a 
foreign governments permission 
the earlier opinion written in response to a query over whether 
the fbi had authority to seize fugitive financier robert vesco in 
the bahamas was eventually published 
justice department officials have stressed that the opinion is 
aimed intended to clarify the fbis legal authority to seize 
fugitives from countries that do not cooperate with the united 
states or where there is no law and order such as in lebanon

elects a new one meyer said but did not say when that would occur 
the party central committee was to meet wednesday to consider 
further changes 
west german political leaders in bonn applauded tuesdays 
resignations but said only democratic reforms will quell unrest in 
the communist nation 
chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters said 
if i am correctly gauging the will of the people they will not be 
content with a few personnel changes they will continue demanding a 
genuinely new political course 
volker ruehe general secretary of kohls christian democrats 
said free elections now must follow 
this move clearly reflects the mounting pressure for real 
democracy and freedom britains foreign office said the 
government did not have popular support they have recognized this 
by resigning 
roman popadiuk deputy white house deputy press secretary said 
in washington if it leads to a process of reform it can be a 
positive development

on monday 750000 demonstrators marched about 500000 in 
leipzig alone 
east german leaders have been promising democratic reforms and 
freer travel in hopes of halting unrest but the draft law appeared 
to satisfy no one 
in rejecting the law in its current form adn said the committee 
declared the proposal does not meet the expectations of citizens 
and will not achieve the political credibility of the state 
the panel recommended eliminating the need for exit visas 
separating travel regulations from emigration rules clarifying the 
access to foreign currency for trips abroad reconsidering the 
30day limit and changing grounds on which passports can be refused 
it also recommended an emergency parliament session to find ways 
of persuading citizens to remain at home the latest tide of 
emigration began early saturday when departure was permitted through 
czechoslovakia the only country to which east germans can travel 
freely 
opening czechoslovakia created the first free passage to the west 
since the berlin wall was built in august 1961 authorities have 
said the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect

the bush administration urged republican 
senators tuesday not to undermine a compromise to increase the 
minimum wage by seeking to amend the deal 
a final vote on the plan was delayed until wednesday morning by 
congressional action to increase the governments debt ceiling 
because of the delay it was unclear whether several gop senators 
said to be mulling amendments would honor the administrations 
request delivered in a letter to the senate from labor secretary 
elizabeth dole

house and senate negotiators acting with 
president bushs assent agreed tuesday on a stiffer set of trade 
sanctions against china in response to last summers tiananmen 
square massacre 
the sanctions were included in a compromise version of a 
twoyear 97 billion bill authorizing activities of the state 
department and related federal agencies the measure now goes back 
to the full house and senate for final approval 
the measure contained harsh rhetoric condemning the unprovoked 
brutal and indiscriminate assault on the thousands of 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing on june 4 noting that at 
least 700 people died and another 27 or more were executed afterward 
the bill also condemned chinas efforts to conceal the truth of 
what happened including clandestinely disposing of bodies and 
suppressing news reports 
but its strongest section was a set of trade sanctions including 
suspension of insurance trough the overseas private investment corp 
for companies doing business in china suspension of trade 
assistance a freeze on exports of satellites a halt to sales of 
controlled munitions including helicopters and parts and crime 
control equipment and an end to sale of certain nuclear material 
and components 
the sanctions go beyond penalties imposed earlier in the year by 
bush and the measure was initially opposed by the white house but 
it was later accepted after rep stephen solarz dny chairman of 
the house foreign affairs asia subcommittee agreed to make it 
easier for the president to waive the sanctions 
in discussions with national security adviser brent scowcroft 
solarz said the measure was altered to allow termination of the 
sanctions if the president certifies such action is in the 
national interest scowcroft reported that the president would not 
veto the measure based on that provision said solarz 
as the conferees worked through a list of disagreements between 
the house and senate bills they also accepted a section that would 
impose criminal penalties on any government official who enlists any 
foreign government to carry out policies that are banned by us law 
the amendment was intended to bar use of us foreign aid as 
leverage on recipient countries to support goals that the united 
states cannot pursue directly because of legal restrictions it is 
aimed at situations like the use of us military aid for honduras 
to pressure that government to support the contra rebels fighting 
the leftist governnment in neighboring nicaragua 
that provision which stemmed from congress discoveries during 
the irancontra affair could still provide a reason for bush to 
veto the bill 
the overall measure included 47 billion for the state 
department and other agencies for the current fiscal year which 
began oct 1 and 5 billion for next year 
it includes major boosts in aid for the united nations and for 
un peacekeeping forces 
they would be authorized to receive a total of 832 million this 
year and 939 million next year compared with 520 million last 
year 
the national endowment for democracy which promotes democratic 
elections abroad could get up to 25 million in each of the two 
years compared with 15 million last year

she travels abroad 
we have a very free press in the philippines and i want to tell

to improve human rights he also said she had done a remarkable job

voters decided new york citys most contentious 
mayoral election in more than a decade tuesday choosing between a 
democrat who would be the first black to win city hall and a 
republican running as a reformer 
three networkowned television stations projected democrat david 
dinkins as the winner over republican nominee rudolph w giuliani 
wabctv wcbstv and wnbctv called the contest based on surveys of 
voters leaving polling places as soon as they closed at 9 pm 
dinkins the manhattan borough president maintained the 
multiracial support that enabled him to defeat threeterm incumbent 
mayor edward i koch in the democratic primary according to 
preelection polls 
giuliani hamstrung by the vast democratic majority in new york 
accepted the tiny liberal partys nomination in a bid to fashion a 
reformminded fusion candidacy that crossed party lines 
in late morning under a clear sky and bright sunshine board of 
elections spokesman jon del giorno said he expected the predicted 
turnout of 60 percent to 65 percent to hold up 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
giuliani 45 a former federal prosecutor making his first run 
for elective office sharply criticized dinkins throughout the 
56day campaign calling him a clubhouse politician with 
questionable ethical standards 
dinkins criticized his opponents change of views on abortion 
giuliani first opposed it then reversed himself and his 
qualifications for office 
dinkins also drew the contest as a battle between democrats and 
the republican party which he blamed for deep federal budget cuts 
in urban programs many prominent democrats campaigned and 
advertised for him 
mainly though the 62yearold dinkins stressed his theme of 
social healing repeatedly referring to new yorks ethnic and racial 
groups as a gorgeous mosaic stitched together by common 
interests both candidates asked that they be judged on their 
abilities not their race 
dinkins was propelled by his solid defeat of koch the ebullient 
but oftenabrasive mayor since 1977 the citys democratic 
organizations and most unions lined up with dinkins providing him 
endorsements donations and thousands of volunteers koch worked and 
advertised for his conqueror 
the general election was the most hotly contested since koch beat 
mario cuomo running as a liberal in 1977 
giulianis most daunting hurdle was the democrats monster edge 
in voter registration democrats outnumber republicans by a 51 
margin in new york 22 million to 450000 there are an additional 
460000 independents 
to overcome that disadvantage giuliani tried to remake the 
crossparty fusion candidacies fashioned by the three 
republicans elected mayor this century seth low in 1901 fiorello 
h la guardia in 1933 1937 and 1941 and john v lindsay in 1965 
in appealing for democratic defectors giuliani stressed his 
record as a corruptionfighting prosecutor and hammered at dinkins 
sloppy financial recordkeeping including his failure to file 
income taxes from 196972 
dinkins said the tax lapse was an oversight and a thing of the 
past but there were damaging reports of more recent flaws 
conflicting valuations dinkins assigned to stock that he transferred 
to his son in 1986 failure to disclose a friends partial funding 
of a vacation he took to france two votes by aides acting in his 
place that contravened an ethics board recommendation 
dinkins also underwent repeated questioning about his 
relationship with jesse jackson whose 1988 presidential campaign he 
headed in the state jackson is anathema to some jewish voters 
because of his support for palestinian rights and his 1984 reference 
to new york as hymietown

the united states expects a broad agreement on 
renewing the lease for military bases in the philippines when 
president corazon aquino makes her second official visit to this 
country this week a senior administration official said 
this is going to be an important and we think a very 
successful visit said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the official also told reporters the united states is confident 
that at the end of the day there will be an agreement on us 
use of military bases in the philippines beyond expiration in 1991 
of the current arrangement 
the issue is expected to come up during mrs aquinos scheduled 
meeting with president bush at the white house thursday and the two 
countries have agreed to start formal negotiations next month on 
extending their bases agreement 
mrs aquino arrives from new york wednesday evening on the second 
us state visit of her presidency white house talks and a state 
dinner hosted by bush meetings with cabinet secretaries and leaders 
of both houses of congress and visits to the international monetary 
fund arlington national cemetery and the national museum of natural 
history are on her twoday schedule in the capital 
predicting long and very complicated negotiations over the 
future of clark field subic bay naval station and four smaller us 
bases the official said we think theres a logic that both 
parties will see that these facilities do in fact serve the 
interests of both countries in very important ways 
i think that will be the compelling fact that will assert 
itself and i think we will have an agreement were going into it 
with that frame of mind he said 
despite the drop in eastwest tension the bases remain important 
to philippines and regional security and are regarded by every 
government in east asia as a stabilizing factor the us official 
said 
they are a known quantity and an important representation of 
the united states commitment to the security and stability of the 
region and i think thats a sentiment still widely shared 
throughout the region 
the main purpose of mrs aquinos visit is to stimulate interest 
in trade and investment along with a continued flow of development 
aid the official noted 
he said philippines officials are in the final stages of reaching

a moderate aftershock from the killer 
earthquake three weeks ago rattled the santa cruz mountains and 
nearby areas on tuesday injuring at least one person but causing no 
property damage officials said 
a woman fell down at a shopping center and broke an arm said 
police in los gatos which is nearly 45 miles southeast of san 
francisco 
the quake measured 43 on the richter scale making it the 23rd 
aftershock of magnitude 40 or higher since the oct 17 quake that 
caused 66 deaths and an estimated 17 billion in property damage 
that quake which registered 71 on the richter scale was 
centered in the santa cruz mountains the center of tuesdays 
aftershock was 12 miles southwest of san jose and 17 miles north 
santa cruz and was felt as far north as san francisco 
it was a pretty good shake said capt bob schuster of the 
los gatos police department 
it was scary said dinah phillips a santa cruz county public 
information officer 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

a judge who sat on the bench for 17 years 
abused his power to get cutrate bank loans demanded bribes from an 
attorney and staff and forced court employees to do personal chores 
prosecutors said tuesday 
joseph f okicki 59 stands accused of a decade of violations 
as judge including extortion bribery open lewdness and coercion 
he has denied the charges he also faces a second trial on 16 counts 
related to more private charges 
we dont mean to say judge okicki was a corrupt judge in every 
case said deputy attorney general lawrence claus in his opening 
statement but okicki definitely abused the very powers the 
privileges and the responsibilities which were conferred upon him by 
you 
the suspended judge frequently wrote on a yellow legal pad as the 
prosecutor described 13 incidents cited in 11 counts of public 
corruption his wife sylvia sat at his side and also took notes 
okickis trial has been the talk of this community in the 
foothills of the allegheny mountains in central pennsylvania 
at times it has verged on soap opera with allegations that the 
judge ordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in his 
underpants or naked and that he ordered court workers to chop his 
wood and feed his dogs 
about 20 observers including reporters were scattered 
throughout the large ornate courtroom where okicki took his oath 
as president judge 1 years ago 
defense attorney james yelovich later told visiting judge richard 
grifo of northampton county he would wait to present his opening 
statement until the prosecution had rested its case 
during his 45minute opening argument claus told the jury 
numerous documents will be presented during the trial to prove 
okickis guilt 
claus said okicki used his influence to secure lower interest on 
a 10000 bank loan in 1986 the prosecutor said the judge also had 
a staff member pay him 500 in exchange for a better job with the 
county and ordered him and another court employee to perform 
personal tasks for him on county time 
last march a state grand jury recommended okicki be charged 
with 13 years worth of violations including extortion bribery 
lewdness and coercion he was elected to his first 10year term as a 
judge in 1971 and reelected in 1981 
although the grand jury recommended 76 charges most of those 
were dismissed withdrawn or combined with other charges 
twentyseven remain 11 of which involve public corruption and 16 of 
which involve more private charges 
the first witness auto dealer allen black said okicki bought a 
pontiac sunbird from his familys dealership in 1984 he testified 
that on one contract the judge signed his full name then crossed it

federal troops sent to maintain order on st croix after hurricane 
hugo have returned home following a presidential order to withdraw 
about 250 troops returned home aboard c141 transport planes

we should all be home for thanksgiving he said 
the c141 and c130 transport planes were constantly flying in 
and out of the island to evacuate heavy equipment and vehicles 
brought by the soldiers when they arrived on sept 21 four days 
after hugos ravaged the island 
president bush ordered the withdrawal last week following a 
request by gov alexander farrelly who said the troops most of 
them from fort hood texas and fort bragg nc were no longer 
needed 
the us troops were sent to curb looting and help local 
authorities maintain order most stores had already been sacked of 
food and other commodities by the time the soldiers arrived 
its important for the virgin islands national guard and the 
police to get back on their own feet now foster said

business organizations the st croix chamber of commerce the board 
of realtors and a civic group called the united concerned citizens 
of st croix 
they charged the governor reneged on his promise to keep the 
federal troops until all power and telephone services were restored

attack 
bridges had tearfully told jurors he was a suicidal cocaine 
addict at the time he showed no emotion tuesday as the verdict was 
read 
in announcing the deadlocke on the assault charge jurors said it 
was possible they could reach a verdict with more instruction from 
the judge said sandi gibbons a spokeswoman for the district 
attorneys office 
the judge told them to go back into the jury room and write down 
questions they need instruction on so they could continue 
deliberating she said

richard ramirez the satanic night stalker 
who butchered or raped more than a dozen people in a spree that 
terrorized southern california in 1985 was sentenced tuesday to 
death in the gas chamber 
before he was sentenced the 29yearold texas killer wearing 
dark glasses uttered a rambling nearly inaudible statement in 
court that ended with the words lucifer dwells within us all 
you dont understand me you are not expected to you are not 
capable of it he said i am beyond your experience i am beyond 
good and evil legions of the night night breed repeat not the 
errors of night prowler and show no mercy i will be avenged 
the sentence pronounced by superior court judge michael a 
tynan carries an automatic appeal 
the killer who entered unlocked houses late at night to murder 
people in their beds and beat others and demand money was convicted 
sept 20 of 13 murders and 30 other felonies including rape 
burglary and sodomy 
he often left satanic symbols scrawled at the scenes of his 
crimes and in at least one instance gouged out the eyes of a 
victim during his preliminary hearing he appeared in court one day 
with a pentagram drawn on the palm of his hand and flashed it to 
reporters as he said hail satan 
the jury recommended oct 4 that he be sentenced to death 
jurors some of whom said they felt the defendant tried to 
intimidate them during the trial by sneering and glaring at them 
returned death penalty recommendations on each of 19 special 
circumstance counts 
the jury has found death a fitting and just punishment and this 
court has ratified that judgment tynan said 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin who prosecuted 
ramirez dismissed ramirez statement as more baloney 
i certainly wouldnt want anyone to listen to what he has to 
say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some 
structure in his life halpin said 
one of the defense attorneys ray clark said appeals courts 
would face a novel issue in the case that of determining the impact 
on the trial of the slaying of a juror during deliberations a juror 
was shot to death in august by her boyfriend who later took his own 
life 
a snarling gravely voiced ramirez had earlier sneered at the 
possibility of being sentenced to death 
big deal death comes with the territory he told reporters 
after last months sentencing recommendation see you in 
disneyland 
after his september conviction ramirez flashed a twofingered 
devil sign at photographers and muttered one word evil

the senate and house agreed tuesday night to 
raise the treasurys borrowing authority above 31 trillion 
preventing the government from reneging for the first time ever on 
its pledge to repay creditors 
the legislation was approved by voice vote in the senate and by a 
26999 margin in the house and sent to president bush his signature 
would prevent the government from running out of cash on thursday 
default is unthinkable said rep bill archer rtexas it 
would strike a devastating blow to our countrys credit rating 
the way for action on the debtceiling increase was cleared 
earlier in the evening when leaders of the house and senate worked 
out an arrangement that removed from the debtceiling debate a fight 
over modifying catastrophic health insurance for retirees 
the agreement was blocked for more than an hour by sen john 
heinz rpa he sought to add to the debtceiling bill an amendment 
that would bar use of the cashladen social security trust fund 
income to make the budget deficit look smaller than it is 
heinz dropped his objection after majority leader george j 
mitchell dmaine assured him that the social security amendment 
would be given priority consideration next year 
under the agreement 
the debtceiling bill has only one amendment that would repeal 
a 1986 law bitterly opposed by business that prohibits 
employerfinanced health insurance plans from discriminating against 
lowerpaid workers house acceptance of that amendment would send 
the package to bush 
the house would pass a new bill repealing catastrophic medical 
coverage for retirees that would send the bill to the senate which 
would be expected to amend it with a plan repealing the unpopular 
surtax that finances catastrophic insurance while retaining coverage 
for hospital bills negotiators from the senate and house would work 
out a compromise somewhere between total repeal and keeping hospital 
benefits 
without an increased debt ceiling the federal reserve board 
would order banks starting thursday not to honor any checks issued 
by the us treasury owners of maturing federal securities would 
have to continue holding those bonds creating a cloud over the 
governments credit rating and raising interests rates economists 
say 
it is important to our economy and our country that we not risk 
the adverse consequences of default by the government mitchell 
said in pleading with colleagues for a quick settlement of the 
problem 
with no more authority to borrow the treasury department 
suspended sales of savings bonds and special state and local 
securities and postponed auctions of 40 billion of securities 
there was only token senate opposition to approving a 
housepassed bill raising the debt limit by 250 billion since that 
would simply give the government authority to borrow to pay for 
goods and services it already has bought but the measure became 
entangled with a host of other major issues blocking quick 
resolution of any 
these included the governments chief deficitreduction bill of 
the year a bipartisan compromise increasing the mininum wage the 
fate of a yearold law expanding medicare to protect retirees 
against cost of a catastrophic illness a major childcare 
initiative and even a lastgasp effort by republicans to pass 
president bushs proposed reduction in capitalgains taxes 
meanwhile bush prodded congress to pass a deficitreduction bill 
that will pass his muster otherwise he told a news conference he 
is prepared to make permanent the 16 billion in automatic spending 
cuts that took effect oct 16 
he said an acceptable bill would have to cut the deficit by about 
14 billion considerably more than he and congress agreed on last 
spring too he said if its all loaded up with special projects 
i wont sign it 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters well 
give him i think what we agreed to give him in the spring 
agreement

bogota colombia ap a bullfighter a marxist councilman and 
12 other people were killed in four attacks tuesday across colombia 
there were no immediate indications that colombias drug cartels 
were involved in the killings the latest to convulse this country 
since the government ordered a crackdown on traffickers in 
midaugust 
authorities said they did not know who carried out an attack in 
which six people riding in a truck were killed by gunmen in an 
ambush in a separate incident a bomb killed six other people 
police said 
late tuesday oky botero a bullfighter who raised bulls and was 
a private pilot was shot to death in an upperclass medellin suburb 
while driving a jeep police said he was riddled with bullets from 
a passing car the authorities said 
at about the same time in santador de quilichao a town about 210 
miles southwest of bogota assailants broke into the house of local 
council president ruben dario fernandez and shot him to death dario 
fernandez was local head of the marxist opposition union patriotica 
party 
officials gave these accounts of the other attacks 
a group of men attacked a coffee plantation near quinchia a town 
120 miles north of bogota early tuesday and a bomb was thrown into 
the owners house 
quinchia mayor saul botero told the rcn radio network that six 
people were killed and five including ranch owner antonio zuluaga 
were wounded he said zuluagas wife the couples two daughters 
two nephews and a ranch worker were killed 
botero reported zuluaga said guerrillas of the popular liberation 
army had demanded money and when he refused the extortioners 
threatened to kill him and his family 
police said they have not determined the motive for the ambush on 
a rural road near san luis de gaceno a town 90 miles east of 
bogota they said all six people aboard a truck were killed by men 
who stopped the vehicle opened fire and then escaped 
it was not known if that attack might be related to a strike by 
22000 banana plantation workers in northern colombia where both 
leftist guerrillas and rightwing death squads are active the 
strike spread to 11 other districts tuesday 
the strike affecting plantations along colombias caribbean coast 
could cause a shortage of bananas in the united states 
companies exporting bananas to the united states have said they 
were losing 1 million a day because of the strike that began nov l 
the strike originally started to protest the killings last month 
of two union leaders union members blamed rightwing death squads 
for the killings 
now the strikers are demanding higher pay shorters hours and 
medical care the average pay for a plantation worker is the 
equivalent of 79 per month for sixday work weeks of 10 hours a day 
the president of the association of banana companies jose manuel 
arias claimed the strikes were organized by leftist guerrillas and 
were a festival of terrorism 
he said in an interview published tuesday by the bogota daily el 
tiempo that the strikes were organized by the colombian 
revolutionary armed forces and the peoples liberation army two of 
colombias six leftwing guerrilla groups 
the strike is centered in apartado a town of 100000 and the 
capital of the region 
gen jose hernan guzman army commander of the region told el 
tiempo he feared there would be violence because of the strike 
he said he had tried to get the companies and workers to reach an 
agreement that has no winners and no losers 
the worst attack in the zone blamed on rightist death squads 
occurred about a year ago on nov 11 when men firing from cars 
killed 43 people in segovia a town 150 miles southeast of apartado

spurning official red square ceremonies to 
commemorate the bolshevik revolution at least 5000 people marched 
through moscow today to protest food shortages pollution 
communist rule and the secret police 
the unprecedented alternative march wound through the capital as 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet leadership stood atop 
the lenin mausoleum and reviewed the traditional display of 
military hardware 
the official tolerance of a competing protest march on a 
hallowed national holiday represented how far the soviet union has 
come from the authoritarian rule of gorbachevs predecessors but 
so did the toneddown nature of the red square celebrations which 
did not put as much emphasis on military might as in previous years

payments to tens of thousands of women injured by the dalkon 
shield but one attorney said ultimate justice can never be 
done for victims of the birth control device 
the high court on monday rejected a challenge by 650 women to a 
25 billion trust for victims of the intrauterine device made by 
ah robins co the fund was established by richmondbased robins 
which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 amid a flood of 
claims because of the dalkon shield the ruling means women injured 
by the iud could begin receiving compensation by next spring 
it also clears the way for the purchase of robins by american 
home products corp a new yorkbased food and drug manufacturer 
that agreed to buy robins for 700 million in stock and to finance 
the trust the deal was conditional on approval of the trust which 
was established as part of robins bankruptcy reorganization plan

an aids victim was led to take holy 
communion for the first time in 15 years a priest was encouraged 
to seek reconciliation between his homosexuality and his 
christianity 
these are examples of the impact of the oasis an unusual 
recently opened episcopal church ministry to gays as recounted by 
its pastor the rev j robert williams 
however opponents say it surrenders to human weaknesses that 
are forbidden by the bible 
the lifestyle is wrong said the rev walter lewis interim 
vicar at the church of the transfiguration in neighboring north 
bergen if you accept the bible as the standard of faith its 
clearly wrong 
the controversial new center opened in june at all saints 
episcopal church in hoboken a city of 40000 people on the hudson 
river across from new york city 
williams 34 who has a mailing list of more than 200 people 
connected with the oasis has spent the last few months on the road 
spreading his view that christianity can and should find room for 
homosexuals 
if were made in the image of god then anything in human 
nature has its corollary in god he said 
he said he and other homosexuals possess a special understanding 
of spirituality because so many people silently linger on the 
edge between masculinity and femininity between respectability 
and criminality 
his travels have led him to offer communion to an aidsafflicted 
gay man who had left the roman catholic church 15 years ago the 
man adorned his hospital room with flowers and along with his 
lover dressed in his sunday best for the occasion williams said 
the ministrys notoriety has reached as far as colombia where a 
roman catholic priest there wrote to williams seeking guidance on 
how to reconcile his devotion to the church with his homosexuality 
he wanted to know how he could fit in within an antigay 
atmosphere williams said 
williams said he has sought to show the priest and other 
homosexuals who have been taught theyre going to hell that 
they have something to offer by acknowledging their differences and 
returning to religion 
williams came out of the closet at age 23 after a 
fundamentalist upbringing in abilene texas he later lived with 
his current lover in a boston suburb along with his lovers former 
wife and two daughters before accepting the post in hoboken 
he said he told church officials who read his application that 
you know youre not getting ozzie and harriet but youre not 
getting ozzie and ozzie either 
however williams said his openness remains rare among 
homosexuals gay people typically lie they make up the name of 
a boyfriend or girlfriend a lifetime of doing that erodes your 
selfesteem and takes its psychological toll 
one homosexual parishioner who insisted on anonymity said he 
began attending because he wanted to answer his own spiritual 
questions and feel a part of something 
he said he grew up as a roman catholic but could not work with 
that churchs gay outreach group dignity because of what he felt 
was the catholic churchs antigay bias 
i see a very strong purpose to something like the oasis the 
man said most people feel quite alienated from organized 
religion ive met a lot of nice people but it hasnt been the 
dating game experience 
beth crippen a 35yearold heterosexual parishioner from 
hoboken with two children said she and other parishioners respect 
williams sexuality as part of who he is 
there are people who i thought might get up and walk and 
havent ms crippen said 
ministers within the newark diocese encompassing seven counties 
in northern new jersey differ over the oasis 
the call of the church is to be inclusive to all people 
said the rev pat close at st johns episcopal church in 
montclair im sure if more parish clergy looked at their 
congregation theyd find gay people within their midst 
a critic of the new ministry the rev richard constantinos of 
christ episcopal church in budd lake said the church should help 
homosexuals to become well instead of encouraging their 
lifestyles 
the ministry doesnt seem to be developing spinoffs the rev 
elmer sullivan a spokesman for the adjacent new jersey diocese 
based in trenton said none of its parishes plan to offer gay

nineteen months after gov buddy roemer 
went to war against populist tradition he claims several 
victories owns up to a major defeat and admits he needs to do a 
better job dealing with legislators 
but roemer a selfstyled reformer who unseated threeterm gov 
edwin edwards in 1987 said he wont back off from a pledge against 
goodold boy dealings i dont want anybody to be 
disappointed in the fact that buddy has gotten a little older and 
hopefully a little wiser 
i can be legitimately criticized for many things but i 
dont think you can say after a year and a half that this is a 
political office 
roemers drive to enact an ambitious agenda have been met 
recently with anger from legislators his style part bulldog and 
part evangelical minister worked against him during debates over 
the states tax system and a divisive budgetbalancing fight this 
year some lawmakers said 
he has had the attitude that its his way or no way said 
rep john alario who was ousted as house speaker last year at 
roemers insistence he should know better he came up as a 
legislator through congress and he knows thats not the way it 
works for some reason he let it go to his head and ran all over 
everyone and thats not a way a democracy should work 
when roemer took office in march 1988 louisiana faced an 
accumulated deficit of 900 million and ranked near the top of the 
unemployment list and at the bottom of most education categories 
he convinced the legislature to give him temporary fiscal authority 
unlike any since huey long who ruled with fiat and a rubberstamp 
legislature in the late 1920s and early 1930s 
in the first few months of roemers term an education reform 
bill gave teachers pay raises the states longterm debt was 
bonded out and the giant agency handling public welfare programs 
was split in half and reorganized 
an office of inspector general headed by a former newspaper 
investigative newspaper reporter was activated to root out 
corruption and mismanagement 
the governor also pledged to bring in new business to end 
louisianas dependence on the volatile petroleum industry and to 
clean up the environment goals often seen as conflicting the 
department of environmental quality was beefed up and the 
legislature this year passed a tough clean air act 
all the way roemer fought with the evil part of our past 
i am a politician i like politics i dont consider it a 
pejorative word but in louisiana it had become that over time 
excuses not to move factions it has not been surpising to me but 
depressing to spend so much time on political warfare 
the governor wound up on the losing side when he tried to change 
louisianas populist tax system which leaned heavily on business 
and has often been described as dont tax you dont tax me tax 
the guy behind the tree 
one attempt to shift the load to individuals through income tax 
failed in the legislature in october 1988 a second passed in march 
only to be rejected by voters in april the fallout was an 
acrimonious fight with the legislature over the current state 
budget a revolt led by his senate floor leader that forced 
acceptance of a sales tax to balance spending and speculation 
roemer already had moved into the ranks of the lame ducks 
even the political enemies of that wanted it to pass ill say 
it for the public record they wanted it to pass because they knew 
it was the answer 
the governor believes he has recovered from the downturn in 
popularity as gauged by postsession media polls but doesnt know 
yet whether he will seek a second term edwards already has said 
hes thinking about another bid and other candidates from 1987 are 
believed to be looking at the 1991 race 
i need to do a lot of things roemer said fundamental 
changes are so important for this state to survive that if i feel a 
year a year and a half from now that to finish the job ive got 
to stay then im going to ask the voters to keep me but i never 
want to make that desire to be paramount in my mind and in the 
actions that take place here 
voters on oct 17 approved a major part of the tax package a 
14 billion highway improvement program funded by a 4cent 
increase in gasoline taxes but roemer said its too early to 
decide on a third attempt at fiscal revision 
former tennessee gov lamar alexander called me and told me 
that it took the second year of his second term to get it done 
he said 
meanwhile roemer said he will concentrate on selling louisiana 
to new industry and spend less time in the stepbystep legislative 
process thats not what i do best but i had to do it 
its time to put that to rest for a while and let me be 
governor let me represent this state sell the state move people 
in terms of the feelings about the state im enjoying this part of 
my term 
roemer also is modifying his approach to dealing with 
legislators a former state representative pj mills was brought 
in as chief of staff and several members of the staff have departed 
voluntarily and involuntarily 
the more we i can put into this and the less me i can put 
into this the more better off we are he said adding that his 
future dealings with the legislature would be a little less 
confrontational we dont have to win every fight we dont even 
have to fight every fight 
alario is reserving judgment what he says hes going to do 
and what he does often doesnt come out the same way

you can tell the old retired slightly rundown 
gumshoe is back on the job he offers his younger brother an 
excop a pint of levys select irish whiskey to help out house 
brand he explains 
so it goes for robert mitchum in jake spanner private eye 
but his new movie airing nov 15 on the usa network is not the 
farewell my lovely or the big sleep kind of classic mitchum 
detective movie 
this is a complete charade mitchum says of this cable 
venture which costars his brother john as the excop a son 
jim as a cop and ernest borgnine as retired mobster sal the 
salami piccolo 
the film he reports includes one scene with a bunch of naked 
girls around the pool i think its all done very discreetly 
students of the cinema may consider spanner close in spoof 
spirit to mitchums his kind of woman that 1951 epic makes one 
suspect that during filming the cast partook of strong drink and 
had fun 
i dont remember what it was all about mitchum insists he 
does recall the fun part and that producer howard hughes made the 
cast film it twice the idea being to make a good film a great one 
that was no fun he says 
mitchum whose more recent work includes the two abc 
megaminiseries war and remembrance and winds of war has 
a dry sardonic sense of humor befitting a star who has logged 46 
years in movies and tv movies 
now 72 he has been around and about his early days dossier 
includes ditchdigging a shot at boxing assistant to the 
astrologer carroll righter the long beach theatre guild and 
writing for radio 
that should prepare a man for anything particularly writing 
scripts where the producers he recalls would say we need 17 
pages by wednesday and they wouldnt say 17 pages of what 
he laughs when asked if he ever feels he could write a better 
script than many offered him well ive just shown the attitude 
that johnny huston had he said if they want em bad kid we can 
make em bad too 
fortuneatly his first substantial role one that got him an 
oscar nomination in 1945 was in a good movie he played the 
warweary infantry captain in the story of gi joe a film 
based on a pulitzer prizewinning column by war correspondent ernie 
pyle 
his first insubstantial roles were in 1943 in hopalong 
cassidy movies he had no trepidations about becoming an actor 
then he says only about getting his horse to go forward and to 
stop 
i didnt know how to ride a horse really as a matter of 
fact i didnt know if you were supposed to bring your own horse 
mitchums plain sleepyeyed unpretentious style often has won 
acclaim that usually occurring when he likes the movie hes in 
away from the cameras he avoids the hollywood ramble he is a 
private man he packs a tight suitcase odd but nice in an era when 
it takes a twobyfour to stop a star from talking about his or her 
personal life 
it is known however that mitchum has played guitar and likes 
jazz guitarists such as barney kessel but he quit as a player a 
long time ago he says there are too many good ones 
he also has written poetry but again thats history he 
insists no i never see anything but the back of a check to sign 
now 
still he likes all the coherent poets particularly william 
wordsworth the english romantic this sparks a memory of a time a 
wordworth passage even showed up in a film he made with katharine 
hepburn 
doing a fine basso version of her distinctive speech pattern 
mitchum recalls that reading the script she comes up and says 
the world is too much with us late ends soon and then demands 
who said that 
i said nobody ever said that she said what i said 
what the hells it mean 
they repaired to the studios library to check the line and its 
punctuation mitchum recalls then the actor with a rep for 
playing tough guys proceeds to surprise his listener by quoting 
part of the passage from memory 
the world is too much with us late and soon getting and 
spending we lay waste our powers

in lee iacoccas view the remedy for extreme 
stock market volatility might lie more in tax reforms than in 
restraints imposed by the exchanges or regulators 
his suggestion how about a 40 percent tax on assets held less 
than 90 days 28 percent up to two years 15 percent up to five 
years and after that the tax rate goes to zero 
iacocca expressed his views in a recent speech to magazine 
publishers and editors in which he stressed the need for americans 
to take the longterm view in building the economy the better to 
compete with japan 
its crazy he said but the whole country seems to be in a 
shortterm feeding frenzy make a quick buck and get out look out 
for yourself live for today and the hell with the future 
the bluntspeaking chairman of chrysler corp said he would also 
include a modest tax on huge pension funds which pay no capital 
gains taxes and whose trading practices are sometimes blamed for 
volatility 
such measures he suggested would force americans to take a 
longterm view to think as investors rather than traders 
as importantly a longerterm view would allow corporate 
managers to develop their own longterm thinking especially 
regarding improvements that would strengthen a company but not pay 
off immediately he indicated 
do you think more companies would be building research and 
development centers if they didnt pay a penalty in their stock 
price for investing in such longterm assets he asked adding 
were upside down in the world by penalizing savings and 
investment and ecnouraging borrowing and consumption 
he offered two other tax suggestions 
1 increase federal revenues with a consumption law beginning 
with gasoline in fact he said start moving our whole tax base 
more toward consumption tap into the underground economy for a 
change 
2 stop all this corporate takeover nonsense by requiring a 
stock to be held for six months before its voting rights can be 
exercised and in addition eliminate interest deductions on debt 
incurred for hostile takeovers 
iacoccas attack on shortterm thinking was broadly based 
educators he said were guilty of permitting the highest 
functional illiteracy rate in the industrial world it worries him 
he said that one of every four americans cant read our damn 
ads 
he said the shortterm view was also a malady of politicians 
because theyre always running for office he observed that 
elected officials must always be prepared to answer one question 
what have you done for me lately 
but many of his most penetrating observations were in reference 
to wall streeters a gang that he said were shorttermers 
almost by definition 
brokers and analysts make money betting right on what a 
company does every 90 days he said whether that company will 
be stronger than ever or bankrupt in three years is almost 
irrelevant 
iacocca made his remarks oct 23 at a combined meeting of the 
magazine publishers association and the association of magazine 
editors hoping for wider distribution chrysler distributed copies 
of the speech this week

the secondgraders fidgeted and giggled 
as they filed into westminster presbyterian church and settled into 
their desks after being bused three blocks from public school arms 
shot up as they vied to read a sign taped to the chalkboard only 
kind words are spoken here 
the westwood elementary school pupils are among thousands of 
public school children across the country who receive bible 
instruction during school hours from private groups that conduct 
classes off school property 
whether in permanent classrooms or in buses or trailers parked 
just off school grounds the classes are a way around the supreme 
court ban on religious teaching and prayer in the public schools 
said roger d blankenship executive director of the national 
association for released time christian education 
its a marvelous alternative and provides an access for a need 
expressed by the american people at large blankenship said 
the court while banning religion in public schools has upheld 
providing offcampus religious instruction during the school day 
when the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates 
with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public 
events to sectarian needs it follows the best of our traditions 
the court held in a 1952 new york case to hold that it may not 
would be to find in the constitution a requirement that government 
show callous indifference to religious groups 
even though released time has been affirmed by the court the 
concept may not be immune to challenge said sebastian graber an 
attorney for the virginia chapter of the american civil liberties 
union who is studying the possibility of filing a lawsuit although 
he has not decided on what grounds 
i wouldnt rule out a general challenge at this time he 
said the supreme court might be asked to reconsider the issue 
but advocates believe they are on firm legal ground in the 
80s we have been picking up momentum and in the 90s there will 
be tremendous growth if i have anything to do with it said 
blankenship 
the thousands of children in all grades enrolled in such 
programs in 19 states still are only a fraction of the nations 
403 million fulltime public school students said jerry traister 
of gatlinburg tenn a member of the nartce board 
its hard to provide an exact figure for releasedtime 
enrollment because many programs operate on shoestring and dont 
report enrollment because they want to avoid legal challenges 
blankenship said the mere filing of a lawsuit could end the 
programs because of the cost of hiring a lawyer 
although any religion may provide releasedtime instruction 
christian groups have had a virtual monopoly on the practice since 
released time began in 1914 in gary ind with nondenominational 
weekday religious education 
weekday religious education was provided in the public schools 
until the practice was banned by the supreme court in 1948 when 
about 2 million children were participating in wre programs 
nationwide 
the ruling forced the programs off school grounds but didnt 
temper the fervor of those attempting to provide bible education 
there were threats of court suits that so many school boards 
weakened said olive i clark coordinator of weekday religious 
education in virginia the programs survived where they were 
strongest 
she insisted that the programs usually financed by churches and 
individuals is not a circumvention of the high courts ban but is 
really the only way you can get to the large population of young 
children about 40 percent of whom have no church connection 
robert s riffee who heads the releasedtime program in 
nottoway county southwest of richmond said the instruction is 
important because public schools are giving children humanism 
keeping god out of the schools 
we need to have these youngsters exposed to the bible he 
said 
the 60yearold virginia weekday religious education program has 
14000 students the largest in the nation miss clark said the 
weekly or monthly classes which usually last 30 minutes to an 
hour must be approved by school boards and children who 
participate need written permission from parents the classes 
which run through the academic year are conducted during school 
hours because that is when we can get such a large percentage of 
the children 
the age of the students varies with the 13 virginia localities 
that have programs the participation rate is about 85 percent 
miss clark said 
whether a community has released time is up to the local school 
board said jim fondriat a spokesman for the virginia department 
of education the state does not get involved in this at all 
the children in virginia wingfields class at westminster 
presbyterian are among more than 700 in waynesboro students who 
participate in the program 
the waynesboro council of wre which has its own bus to 
transport children offers a straightforward presentation of the 
bible biblical history and geography said miss clark who 
directs the program 
the 55minute classes generally are held during recess or 
physical education class they dont miss any regular 
instruction said james w nichols an aide to the waynesboro 
school superintendent thomas l varner 
releasedtime curricula are as varied as the groups that provide 
them 
while traisters cbm ministries stresses memorization of bible 
passages the haversham christian learning center in cornelia ga 
offers no biblical studies whatever said ken wright its 
director of development 
the center 50 yards from haversham central high school offers 
a program for teenagers that builds selfesteem and communication 
skills while focusing on preventing pregnancy and suicide and 
helping teens get along with parents 
but we dont hesitate to open a class with a prayer said 
wright who also is a director of the 5yearold nartce 
miss clark dismissed any suggestion that children not enrolled 
in released time at schools with high participation are stigmatized 
children who stay behind are with their teachers who provide 
enrichment activities nichols said there is no evidence of 
being stigmatized there is a lot less of stereotyping of students 
by their peers than by parents 
but a mother whose 8yearold son doesnt participate said there 
is a lot of peer pressure to join the classroom teacher 
would single my child out he didnt want to go to school said 
the woman who spoke on condition of anonymity i dont believe 
it belongs during school time

after an aged indian woman bessie snake 
lost her husband when he and his two mules were killed by lightning 
while plowing his younger brother dutifully married the widow 
that obligation is part of the religious traditions of the 
delawares and some other tribes matching a responsibility laid 
down in the biblical laws of ancient judaism 
the similarities of early native american religions and 
ancient hebrew religion are astonishing says historian duane 
hale of the creek tribe a researcher of the american indian 
institute at the university of oklahoma 
he also notes congruent strains with early christianity such as 
indian expectations of a christlike benefactor and emphasis on 
communal sharing of everything in common and on modesty by not 
calling attention to oneself 
all american indians were and most are today deeply 
religious and devoted to their belief in one supreme being hale 
said in an interview he discounted past charactertizations of some 
old tribal rites as pagan 
i dont think its pagan to go up on a mountain and pray to 
try to get a vision he said describing the vision quest of 
the sioux and some other tribes its similar to what the 
biblical prophets did 
hale 47 former cochairman of the department of navajo and 
indian studies at navajo community college in arizona and now with 
the universitys institute here researches and writes tribal 
histories 
since 1983 he has completed them for six tribes he also 
conducts training workshops to help indians across the country 
learn how to preserve tribal lore participants have come from 
about 200 of the nations 300 recognized tribes 
thirtyseven of them have tribal headquarters in oklahoma which 
remained mostly indian territory until 1907 the universitys 
western history collections library is considered the best existing 
on the plains tribes 
while indians generally have depended on handing down their 
religious traditions orally theres a great danger they will be 
lost hale said in many cases they have been 
there are not enough indian histories many of the elders are 
dying and i try to teach them to write their histories some are 
beginning to record it and put it in locked files only for the 
tribe 
while indian religion sometimes is portrayed as highly distinct 
from biblical faith hale sees definite resemblances judging on 
the basis of his advanced biblical studies as well as firsthand 
inquiries into indian religion 
christianity and early indian religion have been so interwoven 
that it is often difficult now to tell which came first for them 
hale said of 14 million us indians most are christians but 
many also retain tribal insights he said 
the native american church which combines both christianity and 
native religion stemmed from the ghost dance religion started 
in the 1890s by a paiute indian from nevada wewoka preaching 
return of the buffalo and christ to lift up the downtrodden 
it spread like wildfire hale said adding that it uses the 
hallucigenic peyote bean as a sacrament which also is used in 
a limited way in some other tribal religions 
he said these also make extensive use of chants the drum the 
four directions the circle the smoked pipe and smoke from burning 
cedar waved about by a feather to ward off evil 
however religious details vary from tribe to tribe and often 
remain obscure since there were no reliably balanced accounts of 
indian concepts for the first 100 years of contacts with europeans 
he said 
on how he determines what religious elements are originally 
indian he said i only accept what the elders tell me is true 
some of it possibly came from back there in the seed of 
missionaries to some degree at this point nobody knows 
absolutely 
yet some biblicaltype ideas among indians seem definitely their 
own such as views of humanitys creation a great flood afterlife 
and anticipated return of some variously named special teacher 
such as nanaboosh or great white rabbit 
in indian religion everything is related to nature hale 
said theres a special relatedness with animals and geographical 
features sacred mountains sacred rivers sacred places natural 
forces are intermeshed with supernatural beliefs 
some indian religious rituals are confined to the tribe while 
hale has been allowed in various secret ceremonies beyond his own 
tribe he said there are things youre not going to see nor find 
out about on the outside asked about the secrecy he said 
everything the indian has shared with the white man has 
disappeared the only way to keep something is keep it within 
he emphasized that tribal beliefs focus on a monotheistic god 
called by various names such as the sioux wakan tanka or 
chickasaw great manitu names with such meanings as great 
spirit or he who makes everything 
bessie snake the remarried anadarko okla widow in her 
mid90s her memories going back to early indian ways was quoted 
as saying we always knew god and prayed to him

nbc brings out her motherly instincts 
jillian who has no children plays the mother of 14yearold 
actress lisa rieffel in ann jillian as the show is called 
she makes me miss having a teenage daughter she said 
our relationship is the whole basis of the show ive just lost a 
husband and shes lost a father and were very supportive of each 
other its a comedy but its about selfesteem friendship and 
trust there are a lot of young people in the show but always the 
focus is on that magical relationship between a mother and 
daughter 
the series marks jillians return to regular television after 
numerous tv movies and miniseries in 1985 she underwent a double 
mastectomy for breast cancer her last series was a brief return to 
its a living when the former abc comedy was picked up for 
syndication she starred in nbcs jennifer slept here in 
198384 and as a child she was in hazel 
jillian also stars with tim matheson in the nbc movie little 
white lies a romantic comedy filmed partially on location in 
rome both the movie and premiere of the series were tentatively 
set for late november or early december 
in ann jillian she plays a recently widowed woman who moves 
to a small northern california town where she and her husband spent 
their honeymoon she takes a job in a victorianstyle shop that 
sells coffee jams cookies and muffins 
our dream had been to return to the town she said you 
know with the porch swing and everything but her husband was 
killed on the job as a fireman 
she calls little white lies her reintroduction to the 
audience before the premiere of ann jillian her last movie was 
original sin telecast by nbc last february 
this is the first funny thing ive done in years she said 
the past four or five things ive done have all been dramas im 
not complaining i got three emmy nominations and two golden globe 
nominations i won a golden globe for the ann jillian story 
that movie told of her battle against cancer 
in little white lies jillian plays a policewoman who goes 
to rome on vacation and meets a doctor played by matheson however 
each lies to the other and makes up a phony background she tells 
matheson shes a business executive and he tells her hes a 
hospital orderly 
she wants to keep her identity secret because she thinks men 
want to date her so she can fix traffic tickets hes afraid that 
women only want to go out with him because they want to marry a 
doctor 
we were in rome for only three days so we spent long hours in 
front of the camera said jillian who was accompanied by her 
husband and manager andy murcia we started before dawn each day 
and worked until late at night andy and i had been there on 
vacation a month before so we were able to suggest the best places 
to film 
her husband makes his film debut in little white lies as a 
loudmouth american tourist 
he plays a patient of tims who nearly gives away his phony 
identity she said i felt like a stage mother i wanted to 
tell andy smile baby he hit his marks and was great 
if the movie does well in the ratings we could do some 
sequels the chemistry between tim and i was wonderful which you 
really need for a romantic comedy we had to do a lot of kissing 
and after a while it became technical just figuring out how to do 
it different each time we had one kissing scene in which the 
cinematographer caught a flash of gold light behind us as the sun 
sparkled on the tiber river and the dome of st peters at the 
vatican 
jillian went through some training at the los angeles police 
academy and talked to some women detectives to prepare for her role 
she also got some pointers from her husband a former police 
sergeant in chicago 
andy showed me how to use a gun although my character doesnt 
use one in the picture she said he showed me simple things 
like how to flip a badge id come home from filming and talk 
police jargon and andy would laugh he said its a trade im an 
actor now and youre a cop

at robert redfords place even the 
senators wear blue jeans 
for years this rustic mountain resort was the private hideaway 
of redford the movie star but now redford the environmental 
activist has opened it to a highpowered crowd hes enlisting 
politicians business leaders scientists and others to help him 
find common ground in the polarized landscape of environmental 
politics 
lured by redfords fame they play by redfords rules leave the 
stiff collars and rigid ideologies at home relax and try to see 
opponents as at least partly human 
redford has long been known as one of hollywoods premier 
dogooders using the rugged casual charm that launched his film 
career to call attention to environmental issues 
but as times change so does redford 
at 52 he has softened the radical edges that marked his early 
activism since 1983 when he founded the institute for resource 
management he has been more mediator than instigator drawing 
together adversaries in disputes such as bering sea oil exploration 
and energy development on navajo lands 
the normally lowkey institute took a higher profile in august 
by sponsoring greenhouse glasnost it was an unusual meeting of 
american and soviet officials scientists environmentalists and 
entertainers designed to highlight the threat of global warming due 
to the greenhouse effect 
last month redford tackled nuclear energy bringing together 
industry representatives and environmentalists at sundance to 
debate whether the nations struggling nuclear power industry 
should be revived 
activism is nothing new to hollywood where almost every cause 
has its celebrity champion but redford in an interview explained 
that his passion for the environment long preceded his stardom 
he was 10 years old recovering from a mild case of polio when 
his mother took him to yosemite national park he was awestruck 
i said to myself thats it i want to be a part of that 
i shifted right then i spent more time outdoors i started to 
hike i went to yosemite to work and i learned to climb there 
his native los angeles booming after world war ii also 
affected him 
the air was going bad the fruit groves were disappearing and 
giving way to malls and suburbs everybody just came and grabbed 
what they could grab and built what they could build i took that 
personally i wanted out of there 
his wanderings took him to colorado europe and new york but he 
knew in 1961 that he had found home when he and his wife lola van 
wagenen bought two acres in a canyon near mount timpanagos here 
in the rugged beauty of utahs wasatch range he could ski some of 
the wests finest powder and find the empty silent spaces he 
craved 
he expanded the homestead as his film career gained speed after 
several successful movies in the late 60s culminating with 
butch cassidy and the sundance kid he bought nearly the whole 
canyon complete with a rundown ski resort he named it after his 
character in the movie 
but he soon discovered he couldnt hide from the development 
pressures that had forced him from los angeles highway officials 
proposed widening the provo canyon road which passes near 
sundance redford campaigned against it arguing the project would 
help only truckers while ruining a peaceful canyon and a popular 
troutfishing stream 
that local involvement led to environmental battles around the 
country he lent his name to liberal political candidates he 
showed up at scenic rivers and toxic waste sites he lobbied for 
energyconservation laws 
in 1975 a consortium of utilities proposed building a 
coalfired power plant on utahs kaiparowits plateau redford 
researched the project concluded it was a boondoggle and jumped 
into the fray the project was shelved and redford was burned in 
effigy by angry opponents 
despite his victories redford disliked the contentiousness of 
environmental politics and the boneheaded arguments he heard on 
both sides 
his presence publicized issues but it also heightened 
opposition you were almost canceling yourself out he said 
he founded the institute for resource management so he could 
take a quieter less inflammatory role 
it complements another redford organization also dedicated to 
the human factor his sundance institute has sponsored film dance 
and screenwriting workshops at the resort since 1980 helping 
independent artists pursue their visions without the pressure to 
go commercial 
the irm works on the premise that nobody including an 
industrialist wants to destroy the planet typically the institute 
puts adversaries together in a room for a few days and lets them 
seek their own solutions 
not all conferences occur at sundance one of the institutes 
bestknown attempts to reach common ground started at sea and 
nearly sank there 
it was august 1985 the issue was oil drilling in the bering 
sea and redford thought a pleasure cruise in californias morro 
bay would ease tensions between the oil executives and 
environmentalists who had reluctantly agreed to meet 
but the adversaries werent talking and the boat started 
heaving in 9foot waves pretty soon everyone was sick redford 
said the image of environmentalists and industry heads throwing 
up together was something i wont forget i also thought it was the 
end of our organization 
it proved instead to be the human factor he seeks eroding 
participants reserve the conference led to an extraordinary 
agreement that recommended drilling in some areas and placing 
others offlimits 
interior department officials say they adopted many of the 
agreements provisions in their bering sea drilling plans though 
not enough to satisfy redford who still contends the agency 
shelved it 
redford manages to avoid the hollywood penchant for all flash 
and little substance said frederic krupp executive director of 
the environmental defense fund who spoke of the actoractivists 
vision and hard work 
redford also is gaining some friends in industry his old 
nemesis from the kaiparowits battle howard allen head of 
southern california edison now is chairman of the irm board 
in recent years allen said he has developed a cautious 
respect for productivity economic considerations and balance 
hes also developing new ways to integrate his film career and 
environmental interests his two institutes collaborated this year 
on a documentary narrated by redford about yosemite and last 
year redford directed the milagro beanfield war in which poor 
new mexican villagers battle a recreational development the 
villagers win of course 
redfords own development at sundance aims to complement nature 
architectural digest recently praised the resorts attempt to 
echo the canyons geology with roughhewn siding and old 
treetrunk columns that help the auditorium lodge and guest 
cottages blend into the background 
once a year redford requires all sundance employees to drop 
their usual tasks and plant a tree at the global warming 
conference while speeches droned on redford sometimes gazed 
wistfully out the window at children playing by a pond 
it was the human factor again 
at the point when people start repeating themselves or the 
same person wants more time on the floor thats the time to get 
out he said thats the time to go plant a tree

improvements in the global economy and a 
steadier us dollar are helping boost the outlook for american 
farmers in the year ahead agriculture department analysts 
elizabeth mack and ralph monaco say 
solid foreign growth prospects and only modest changes in the 
value of the dollar point to continued moderate export increases 
they say so export demand will continue to put some pressure on 
us manufacturing capacity increasing the likelihood that 
spending on new plants and equipment will continue 
mack and monaco writing in the november issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine said general economic growth looks likely to be 
mildly supportive of us agriculture over the next six to 12 
months 
in their review the two economists said assessments of the 
general economic situation have changed considerably over the last 
year shifting progressively across three main possibilities 
an inflation spiral similar to that of the late 1970s an eased 
monetary policy induced by recession and recently a decelerating 
export growth due to the rise in value of the us dollar abroad 
adroit policymaking and midyear commodity price slides have 
eliminated the first two possibilities as probable outcomes over 
the coming six months the report said the current expansion 
is virtually assured to last well past its seventh birthday this 
month 
but economic forecasting is not without pitfalls and 
rollercoaster thrills consider what has happened in the last 
couple of years 
in early 1988 many economists speculated about rising inflation 
and another upward price spiral that could spell trouble in the 
months and even years ahead 
by mid1988 the report said the chairman of the federal 
reserve board warned it might be necessary to cool off the economy 
interest rates began to rise 
consumer prices which rose 18 percent in 1986 and 36 percent 
in 1987 rose 41 percent in 1988 and in the first quarter of 1989 
overall consumer prices grew at an annual rate of 54 percent 
while producer prices jumped 102 percent 
but food and energy price hikes accounted for most of 
inflations quickend pace the report said producer prices for 
finished food products rose 52 percent in 1988 but spurted an 
annualized 131 percent in the first quarter of this year perhaps 
because of last years drought 
producer prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline and 
heating oil jumped at an annual rate of 41 percent in the first 
three months of 1989 mainly because of tighter opec production 
restrictions and global oil mishaps 
rising interest rates began to take a toll on interest 
sensitive components of demand housing and autos in particular 
the report said the economy slowed sufficiently that by the 
middle of the second quarter of this year fears of an impending 
recession replaced worries over spiraling inflation the report 
said 
with inflation easing the fed eased back on monetary policy to 
ward off recession and interest rates came down a thirdquarter 
census bureau survey of anticipated spending for plants and 
equipment suggested continued robust growth 
as inflation and recession fears dissipated during the first 
three quarters of 1989 concern began to mount about the rising 
value of the dollar the report said by september the dollar 
was up 12 percent from the first of the year 
a rising dollar tends to reduce us export volume and increase 
imports by raising the prices of goods sold to foreign countries 
and reducing prices of items imported by the united states 
while the dollar has gone up throughout 1989 it is still 
about 37 percent below its historic peak in 1985 the report 
said some analysts associated the recent rise with climbing us 
interest rates and relatively slow money growth with us interest 
rates flat or slightly falling some now expect the dollars value 
to diminish 
forecasts by the international monetary fund indicate that while 
us dollar movments are likely to be modest over the next few 
months growth in major developed countries suggest continued 
healthy demand for us exports the report said 
the imf forecast put japans real economic growth at 47 percent 
in 1990 west germanys at 3 percent and canadas at 2 percent the 
three account for about 40 percent of us exports economies of 
developing countries which also accounted for 40 percent of 
overall us exports in 1988 are expected to show continued robust 
growth

rivals for control of the unix software standard 
say they are expanding discussions on cooperation that could lead 
to a healing of the split between them 
the statement monday was good news for computer users who have 
been pressing hard for a single unix standard unix is a base layer 
of software that makes it possible for programs to run on many 
different kinds of computers the same way compact discs can be 
played on many different brands of compact disc players 
unix is split now between a group that includes american 
telephone amp telegraph co the originator of unix and a rival camp 
whose main members are international business machines corp 
digital equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
the split means that programs written for one version of unix 
wont necessarily work with the other version the latest atampt 
version was released last week while the one from the rival open 
software foundation is due out in late 1990 
what were trying to do is remove the assumption and 
perception that were all competing with each other david tory 
the president and chief executive of the open software foundation 
said in a telephone interview 
we genuinely want to converge both parties and the industry 
wants us to as well tory said 
discussions have been going on for the past year and if they go 
well they may lead to something big and dramatic around the end 
of this year said atampts michael defazio director of system 
software for the companys unix software operation 
even if the talks dont result in a major breakthrough the two 
groups will continue working on areas of cooperation in the area of 
open software defazio said 
ibm digital and others formed the open software foundation in 
may 1988 out of fear that atampt was controlling unix for its own 
commercial advantage atampt attempted to allay such fears by ceding 
control of unix standards to an independent group called unix 
international of which it is a member

the pepsi logo will appear in a new nintendo 
video game making pepsicola co the first soft drink maker to tap 
into electronic games for commercial exposure the companies said 
under an agreement announced monday between pepsi and tradewest 
which is licensed to manufacture video games for nintendo of 
america inc pepsis logo will be featured in magic johnsons fast 
break 
the professionalstyle video basketball game to be released 
early next year is set in an arena packed with cheering fans 
the pepsi name appears in the games opening title sequence and 
on signs at courtside the soft drink makers logo also is on the 
scoreboard shown at the end of each quarter 
pepsis identification in the game mirrors the real life 
display of logos and banners that adorn athletic venues across the 
country said michael d simpson pepsis executive vice 
president of marketing and national sales 
the amount of money pepsi is paying to be a makebelive game 
sponsor was not disclosed 
only one other company ever has had its symbol shown in a 
nintendo game the racket attack game used the logo of the wilson 
tennis racket and sporting goods manufacturer 
the hookup between pepsi and nintendo is part of a trend that 
has developed as companies search for alternative advertising 
outlets 
as traditional advertising mediums become increasingly 
cluttered and segmented advertisers must respond creatively 
simpson said 
the proliferation of commercials on television plus changes in 
viewing habits including the widespread use of video cassette 
recorders and the practice of changing channels to zap past 
commercials has persuaded advertisers to promote products in new 
ways 
pepsi has had some experience and success with nontraditional 
marketing methods for instance in 1987 pepsi placed the first 
commercial ever on a home video cassette putting the diet pepsi 
mustang ad was placed on the film top gun 
the beverage giant says video games potentially are a major 
marketing medium it is estimated that nearly 26 percent of us 
households will own a video game machine by the end of this year 
nintendos entertainment system that turns a tv set into a game 
screen is projected to be in 22 percent of american homes by the 
end of this year 
nintendo of america a subsidiary of japans nintendo co ltd 
dominates the us electronic games market some of its most 
popular titles feature the mustachioed mario brothers 
pepsi already has a promotional alliance with nintendo on a 10 
million national campaign for the holiday season 
during the twomonth campaign which began nov 1 pepsi will 
give away thousands of nintendos newest gadget the game boy 
handheld video game through contests and sweepstakes other

steve harris said monday no key personnel or titles will change 
harris said 
were merging chrysler motors into chrysler corp and the 
legal entity of chrysler motors goes away harris said the 
move is purely technical legal and taxoriented it will not have 
any impact on people or titles and will not change the companys 
internal or external operation in any way 
harris declined to say how much tax money the company expects to 
save because of the move 
that news comes on the heels of chryslers announcement friday 
that it will stop car production at its jefferson avenue assembly 
plant in detroit in february more than a year earlier than 
originally anticipated will cut one of two shifts at its carmaking 
plant in st louis and close a parts plant in wisconsin next year 
about 4000 hourly workers will be affected the consolidation 
involves the elimination of the dodge omni and plymouth horizon 
subcompact models 
within the next year chrysler will face increasing competition 
for its two most profitable vehicles jeeps and minivans and 
will deal with lower earnings due to the projected softening in the 
north american auto market and it will sit down at the bargaining 
table with the united auto workers union 
on friday uaw vice president stan marshall in charge of the 
unions chrysler department sounded an ominous note as the uaw 
prepares preliminary work toward negotiations next summer 
this decision is bound to have a detrimental impact on our 
future relations marshall said of chryslers announcement 
friday it reinforces the view that the corporations commitment 
to retaining the good faith and loyalty of its workers is sorely 
lacking when the going gets tough 
while things are tough for chrysler this year they arent the 
same as they were a decade ago when chairman lee iacocca was 
haunting the halls of congress looking for guarantees for millions 
of dollars in state and federal loans 
a dozen years ago interest rates and gasoline prices were much 
higher than now and the japanese auto invasion was gearing up to 
rob us makers of their market share 
chrysler had to go to the federal government to guarantee 
millions of dollars in loans to keep it afloat it also went to the 
uaw with contracts calling for worker concessions 
during the 1980s chrysler and the uaw agreed to modify work 
rules at some plants and to cooperate on everything from factory 
floor decisions to those made in the board room 
in 1990 for the first time in years the uaws contracts with 
the big three expire on the same day sept 14 and an end may be 
at hand to the practice of pattern bargaining in which the 
union targets one company reaches a contract with it and then 
signs similar agreements with the other two said labor analyst 
dale brickner 
what youre going to see is contracts tailored to individual 
corporations said brickner associate director of the school of 
labor and industrial relations at michigan state university in east 
lansing the old theory of pattern bargaining is a dead duck 
marshall says thats bunk 
we just got back to pattern bargaining again and thats 
exactly where well stay he said monday chryslers profits 
are still way up from where they were during the lean time 
in the first nine months of 1980 chrysler lost 148 billion 
during the same time this year it made 7175 million 
they are getting too worried about their stockholders and not 
enough about their workers marshall said

the southland corp the nations largest 
convenience store retailer says it will step out of the oil 
business and realize a more than threefold return on its 6yearold 
investment in citgo petroleum corp 
southland which acquired citgo in 1983 by issuing 254 million 
in stock sold half of the tulsa oklabased company in 1986 to 
the venezuelan stateowned oil company petroleos de venezuela for 
290 million on monday it announced plans to sell the other half 
to the venezuelan company for 675 million 
southland said terms of the agreement had not been completed and 
remain subject to an acceptable definitive agreement 
the sale would give the dallasbased operator of the 7eleven 
convenience store chain a boost as it works to continue meeting 
huge debt payments resulting from the companys 49 billion 
leveraged buyout in 1987 that took the company private 
the deal also would give venezuela a greater us market share 
for its crude oil 
the transaction would make citgo the first large us oil 
company to be acquired by a member of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
opec members have carried out a campaign of acquiring the 
downstream side of the oil business refining and distribution 
facilities in order to guarantee access to industrialized markets 
in the face of falling oil prices during the last decade 
the citgo purchase comes on the heels of a joint venture formed 
last week by petroleos de venezuela and union oil of california 
that includes 50 percent shares of major assets such as unocals 
chicago refinery near lemont ill 
petroleos de venezuela also bought jan 1 the halfinterest in a 
corpus christi refinery from champlin refining that it did not 
already own 
last year saudi arabia paid 128 billion for half of texaco 
incs refining and marketing operations in 23 eastern and gulf 
coast states 
one of citgos principal assets is the nations eighthlargest 
refinery located in lake charles la said southland spokeswoman 
cecilia stubbs norwood the refinery is able to efficiently convert 
lowgrade crude oil into high octane fuel 
citgo created from the refinery marketing and transportation 
operations of the old cities service co earned 1656 million on 
41 billion in revenues last year a 24 percent increase in sales 
in the quarter ended june 30 earnings were 392 million on 13 
billion in sales compared with 339 million on 102 billion in 
sales in the yearago quarter 
southland taken private by the founding thompson family in the 
1987 buyout said in may it would seek ways to cash in on its 
interest in citgo and the sale price is in the range analysts had 
expected the venezuelan company has first rights in acquiring 
southlands stake 
southland has some large payments coming due on its debt with 
258 million due dec 31 and an additional 250 million due through 
next year some analysts have questioned southlands ability to 
meet those payments but the company has disputed those forecasts 
southland said it would continue as a prime retailer of citgo 
products 
in the quarter ended june 30 southland lost 6701 million 
besides the lake charles refinery petroleos de venezuela will 
acquire pipelines running from the refinery to chicago and new 
jersey 43 oil terminals and access to 300 other terminals 
scattered across the us 
citgo supplies 6 percent of the us aviation fuel market 5 
percent of the lubricant market and 4 percent of service station 
sales 
venezuela also owns part of four refineries in west germany two 
in sweden one in belgium and the huge isla refinery in curacao 
capable of processing 300000 barrels a day 
venezuela in 1988 processed about 945000 barrels a day of 
refined oil inside venezuela and 630000 barrels in its overseas 
refining operations placing it among opec leaders in refined oil 
production

while us and japanese negotiators resumed 
talks on how to eliminate structural barriers that have contributed 
to the 50 billion trade deficit with japan american business 
leaders were telling congress why the talks were needed 
they told a senate panel monday that they are more interested in 
opening up japanese markets than protecting american markets 
the business leaders also told the senate finance committees 
international trade subcommittee that changes are needed on both 
sides of the pacific to solve the usjapanese trade imbalance 
japans systems for buying and distributing goods are the 
biggest obstacle facing us manufacturers who export or do 
business in japan said rk morris director of international 
trade policy for the national association of manufacturers 
he and other witnesses complained about japans distribution 
system under which firms purchase parts and supplies almost 
exclusively from longterm business partners and companies either 
make their own supplies or keep tight reins over their suppliers 
but morris who just returned from a monthlong trip to japan 
added we should not kid ourselves we cannot expect real help 
from the japanese in reducing their surplus or our deficit unless 
we in the united states can demonstrate the very great importance 
we attach to constructive change in this area 
mitchell e kertzman speaking for the american electronics 
association said we believe the imbalance in commercial 
relations between the us and japan will destroy the international 
trading system unless it is effectively addressed 
he said us electronics exports to japan are only 63 billion 
per year compared with 268 billion of us electronics imports 
from japan 
he also said there must be changes in this country 
frankly it is our hope that our japanese friends will press 
the us government to deal with its own economic problems that 
impact the bilateral trading relationship high among these 
problems is the high cost of capital driven by our enormous budget 
deficit and our tax system which favors consumption over savings 
and investment he added 
a harder line was taken by texas oilman and sometime corporate 
raider t boone pickens who called corporate japan a closed 
shop 
he said the most damaging structural barrier to free trade 
was japans cartellike system of interlocking corporate 
ownership 
because of that pickens claimed a relatively small group of 
insiders dictate corporate policy 
he said his own problem with koito manufacturing co a japanese 
auto headlight maker is symbolic of the current trade relations 
between the united states and japan 
pickens known for his often hostile raids on us companies 
has been battling with the management of koito for representation 
on its board but he has been rebuffed despite his 26 percent stake 
in the company 
the entire system of japan is geared toward the denial of a 
meaningful flow of information to shareholders said pickens 
nearly all the days speakers supported the continuing 
structural impediment initiative talks between us and japanese 
representatives 
the talks first held sept 4 and 5 in tokyo are an outgrowth 
of a white house decision in may that found japan india and brazil 
responsible for restrictive trade and investment practices under 
us trade law 
at the same time the united states and japan agreed to discuss 
a number of structural impediments outside the procedures and 
timetables of us trade laws

the us supreme court cleared the way for 
payments to tens of thousands of women injured by the dalkon 
shield but one attorney said ultimate justice can never be 
done for victims of the birth control device 
the high court on monday rejected a challenge by 650 women to a 
25 billion trust for victims of the intrauterine device made by 
ah robins co 
the fund was established by richmondbased robins which filed 
for bankruptcy protection in 1985 amid a flood of claims because of 
the dalkon shield the ruling means women injured by the iud could 
begin receiving compensation by next spring 
it also clears the way for the purchase of robins by american 
home products corp a new yorkbased food and drug manufacturer 
that agreed to buy robins for 700 million in stock and to finance 
the trust the deal was conditional on approval of the trust which 
was established as part of robins bankruptcy reorganization plan 
many of these women have been waiting for years for resolution 
of their claims said michael sheppard director of claims 
resolution for the trust this is a major step forward 
an estimated 112800 women have filed claims with the trust and 
42 percent have been paid sheppard said he predicted payments 
under mondays ruling could begin as early as march 
marketed in the early 1970s the dalkon shield allegedly caused 
infections that brought infertility spontaneous abortions pelvic 
inflammation and in some cases death sales of the dalkon shield 
ended in 1974 but the product wasnt recalled until 1984 
listen to the misery caused by the dalkon shield and you 
realize that ultimate justice can never be done even with a 26 
billion payout said guerry r thornton jr an atlanta attorney 
who represented the dalkon shield victims association 
almost all claimants accept the fact that justice is a 
relative concept the greatest good for the largest number 
sharon lutz a detroit lawyer representing 18000 women who 
urged the court to uphold the settlement said it had been a 
long long struggle for a terrible terrible tragedy but todays 
great news marks the beginning of the end 
robins spokesman roscoe puckett jr said the company is very 
pleased that the way finally has been cleared for consummation of 
its reorganization plan 
linda hightower director of the dalkon shield victims 
association in atlanta and one of the women injured by the iud 
said she was terrified the challenge to the trust set up to 
compensate victims would mean more long years of battles 
i had much rather deal with the trust than to have direct 
dealings with the robins company ms hightower said they made 
it very difficult for the women they injured to get compensation 
for their injuries 
one dissenting vote was cast in the courts decision to reject 
the challenge justice byron r white voted to grant full review to 
those arguments 
the women who took the case to the supreme court contended the 
settlement wrongly barred future lawsuits against robins officials 
and others and maintained the trust fund wasnt large enough 
alan b morrison lead lawyer for the claimants challenging the 
settlement said he wouldnt ask the court for a rehearing 
early outofcourt settlements with individual women averaged 
50000 and that had risen to 75000 before the bankruptcy said 
douglas bragg a denver lawyer representing some women 
the higher figure would bring the settlement cost to nearly 5 
billion the lower to more than 3 billion 
bradley post an attorney representing the challengers said 
nearly half the remaining settlements are likely to average 
100000 
sheppard said the trust has set the end of february as a target 
date to send a packet of information and a questionnaire to those 
with outstanding claims 
american home products chairman john r stafford said he 
expected the company to complete its acquisition of robins by 
years end

last months deadly earthquake ripped 
the economic heart out of this community by ravaging the pacific 
garden mall but merchants hope to salvage the christmas shopping 
season by moving to tents 
i know that if im not open the day after thanksgiving im 
bankrupt mall businesswoman margaret wilson told the city 
council last week 
hardest hit in this quaint seaside town 60 miles south of san 
francisco was the mall a typically eclectic california collection 
of about 250 shops 
they sold everything from rare books to imported coffee beans to 
beads as well as many necessities in turnofthecentury buildings 
linked by openair walkways along a treelined street 
three people were killed in the mall and several dozen of its 
buildings crumpled by the oct 17 quake which registered 71 on 
the richter scale killed 66 people in northern california and did 
7 billion in damage 
on monday gov george deukmejian signed a temporary 
quartercent sales tax increase into law to raise a projected 800 
million for earthquake relief 
the hike which takes effect dec 1 and lasts through 1990 adds 
to a statewide sales tax of 6 cents on the dollar higher in some 
areas because of local levies 
the tax rise was part of a package of quake relief legislation 
enacted in a special session of the legislature that includes 200 
million in assistance from state reserve funds and 150 million in 
tax relief 
now that theyve gotten over the shock of the quake many santa 
cruz merchants have put aside competition and banded together 
with a lot of work and a little luck they say those hardest hit 
by the quake will be able to come up with enough money to lease the 
tents and reopen by thanksgiving weekend 
ms wilson owner of the variety store lily wongs is among the 
majority of mall merchants who have vowed to rebuild her store was 
damaged but can be repaired 
my guess is its going to be a cliffhanger every single day 
until the mall itself opens ms wilson told the city council 
but we can do it and it will be open and we will have a christmas 
downtown 
the council agreed to donate 20000 toward rental of three huge 
tents with a total floor space of 20000 square feet it would 
cost 314000 to lease the tents for the year the merchants figure 
theyll be displaced 
city officials also are trying to identify other sites that 
could be used as retail space said annmarie mitroff a city 
spokeswoman 
among those is a bank of america building and a former county 
jail said ms mitroff the neighboring city of scotts valley has 
agreed to donate to the merchants a 5000squarefoot portable 
building she said 
it is crucial the businesses get back on their feet as soon as 
possible she said 
the mall merchants collectively sell about 100 million worth of 
merchandise annually and generate about 1 million a year in sales 
tax revenue for the city she said 
as many as a fourth of the malls businesses now face the 
wrecking ball if they havent been torn down already ms mitroff 
said

the world traded a record 27 trillion worth 
of goods last year with the united states and 19 other industrial 
countries accounting for 2 trillion of it the international 
monetary fund reported 
the overall total was an increase of 15 percent over the year 
before a rise only slightly less than the 18 percent increase of 
1987 trade also increased when measured in tonnage instead of 
dollars and it was increasing faster than world output as it has 
generally done since the 1970s 
but a separate study by the fund warned of new restrictions 
inclusive figures in the imfs annual direction of trade 
statistics yearbook for 1989 were made available on monday they 
covered 161 countries including china 
the soviet union and some of its allies which are not members 
of the imf were handled separately the fund reported their trade 
also increased substantially after declines or small changes over 
the past five years but they accounted for only 2 percent to 3 
percent of the worlds commerce 
west germany shipped 323 billion worth of goods as the worlds 
biggest exporter which it has been since 1986 the united states 
showed the biggest increase 267 percent to follow close behind 
with 320 billion japan was third with 265 billion 
the united states remained the biggest importer with 460 
billion worth compared with west germanys 251 billion and 
britains 189 billion 
at the other extreme the fund could not find any exports to 
report from tuvalu formerly the ellice islands in the pacific 
tuvalu with a population of only 8000 imported 4 million worth 
third world countries especially the rapidly industrializing 
countries of asia boosted their imports taiwan bought 50 billion 
worth of foreign goods up from 35 billion the year before and 
south korea 51 billion instead of 41 billion both were still 
selling much more than they bought taiwan 60 billion worth and 
south korea 61 billion 
africas trade also increased but at 105 percent it grew more 
slowly than in the rest of the world 
latin americas trade continued strong growth 16 percent for 
exports and 15 percent for imports though the pace was slower 
than in 1987 
in the middle east exports grew by only 34 percent as oil 
sales levelled off middle east imports increased at about the same 
pace as the worlds 153 percent 
the share of the third world as a whole in global trade 
increased to more than 26 percent but did not reach the levels of 
the earlier 1980s when it accounted for almost a third

texasbased oilman t boone pickens is demanding 
that koito manufacturing co in which he is the largest 
shareholder pay an increased dividend for the first half of fiscal 
1989 koito said tuesday 
in a letter received by koito monday pickens demanded that it 
increase its dividend to 7 yen per share from the current 5 yen 
koito spokesman shinji hagiwara said 
he said koito would notify pickens of its decision after a 
meeting of company executives on nov 21 
pickens known for his often hostile raids on us companies 
has been battling the management of koito a japanese auto parts 
maker for representation on its board 
he has complained that despite a 26 percent stake in the 
company he has been denied a seat on the board although toyota 
the japanese car maker has three seats with only 19 percent of the 
companys stock 
in his letter pickens said the extra dividend payment would not 
go to the azabu motors co group from which pickens bought many of 
his shares hagiwara said 
he said pickens comments about azabu were in response to an 
earlier inquiry from koito which had been concerned that pickens 
would pay the extra dividend to azabu 
koito believes the extra dividend demanded by pickens is 
intended to cover a 117 billion yen 82 million payment to 
koito by azabu in fines for rapid trading in its stock said 
another koito official mikio tsuruta 
although mr pickens said the money wouldnt go back to azabu 
they are partners and azabu admitted that he said pickens has 
refused to comment on their partnership he said 
it doesnt seem very wise if our dividend will indirectly help 
make up azabus loss does it tsuruta said 
the finance ministry earlier this year found that azabu had 
violated rules prohibiting rapid resale of shares and ordered it to 
turn over the profits gained from its sale of koito stock to the 
company 
earlier this year koito shareholders voted to deny pickens a 
seat on the board pickens said in washington recently that his 
difficulty in obtaining management rights in koito is symbolic of 
the current trade relations between the united states and japan 
pickens repeated his assertion that his purchase of koito stock 
was not intended for speculative purposes 
we would never do anything to damage the company said 
pickens denying that he planned a socalled greenmail campaign in 
which a corporate raider buys a companys stock in hopes the 
company will buy the shares back at a higher price

us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter is 
among character witnesses scheduled to testify for a former chicago 
mercantile exchange chairman accused of failing to stop two 
employees from bilking investors of thousands of dollars 
brian monieson head of gnp commodities inc in chicago is the 
focus of a hearing before a commodity futures trading commission 
administrative law judge considering the regulatory agencys 
allegations 
although the cftc does not allege that monieson himself engaged 
in fraud it contends in an 18page complaint that from at least 
january 1986 until may 1986 he did not act in good faith andor 
knowingly induced directly or indirectly the fraudulent trade 
allocation by two gnp brokers 
monieson refused to see what everyone else could see and that 
was that his customers were being robbed cftc attorney patricia 
donahue said in a statement monday at the start of the sevenday 
hearing but moniesons attorney jerrold salzman said the cftcs 
case is flawed based on conjecture speculation and unreliable 
evidence 
salzman contends his client did not directly supervise the 
workers named in the cftc complaint norman furlett and ira 
greenspon and he argued that monieson believed in good faith 
that their customer dealings were honest 
furlett and greenspon have since left the company their 
attorney james koch said the two never stole a dime didnt 
defraud any customers 
were here today because the cftc is on a runaway train on the 
wrong track he said in his opening statement 
monieson 53 founded gnp in 1972 headed the mercantile 
exchange from 1983 through 1985 and remained at gnp during that 
time 
yeutter who served as merc president under monieson is 
expected to make a statement on moniesons behalf that will be read 
into the record at the hearing before george painter a cftc 
administrative law judge 
yeutter has worked with monieson and has known him for years 
and he will offer his testimony as a us citizen who feels very 
strongly about something a spokeswoman said 
others scheduled to testify for the defense include robert 
wilmouth president of the national futures association who said 
recently of monieson his moral character is above rproach 
the cftc alleges that the brokers at gnp described by salzman 
as a top clearing member of the merc and chicago board of trade 
engaged in allocated trades that defrauded customers of 
thousands of dollars 
the term refers to initiating futures contracts without the 
required customer account numbers then keeping profitable trades 
for themselves while sticking customers with the losers 
this is a particularly insidious fraud you have because a 
customer cant win and doesnt know hes being bilked ms 
donahue told the judge 
according to the cftc monieson was told several times between 
june 1985 and may 1986 that the two brokers were engaging in 
fraudulent activity but he chose to ignore the warnings and did 
nothing to stop the brokers actions ms donahue said 
the defense maintains that the allegations of fraud stem from 
complaints by a disgruntled lowerrung employee who was fired from 
gnp and vowed to seek revenge 
if found guilty the three defendants could be permanently 
barred from trading and fined hundreds of thousands of dollars

with fanfare more typical of movie or amusement 
park openings compaq computer corp has introduced two computer 
systems it says will revolutionize the industry 
the houstonbased firm used indoor fireworks laser lights and 
booming synthesizer music monday to announce deskpro 48625 a 
system touted to be the worlds most powerful desktop personal 
computer and the systempro personal computer system said to be 
another industry milestone 
our new product offers true general purpose flexibility 
meaning it will not become obsolete compaq president rod canion 
said 
you could compare it to the ibm ps2 model 80 which is a 
floorstanding unit he said but the deskpro 48625 has more 
expansion capability even though it sits on a desk 
the deskpro 48625 uses an intel corp 486 microprocessor as its 
heart and has three times the computing speed of its predecessor 
which used a 386 chip 
the systempro designed for network and multiuser situations 
functions with a highspeed drive array storage system in a tiny 
area it fits under a desk yet has the computing power of 
minicomputers that require racks of equipment according to compaq 
its not just a higher horsepower engine but a new way of 
doing things canion said what were really doing today is 
setting the wheels in motion toward a major fundamental change in 
the computer industry 
the compaq announcement came one day before rival computer maker 
ncr corp unveiled its 486based personal computer unlike compaqs 
deskpro however ncr will use a system similar to the ibm personal 
system2 line of personal computers 
ncr also announced that its entire personal computer line would 
be sold through businessland incs 125 locations worldwide 
ibm has not introduced a personal computer built on the 486 chip 
yet but it did come out with a card that lets users plug the 486 
chip into their existing personal computers 
the 486 chip is so powerful that it will allow personal 
computers to do certain jobs now done by engineering work stations 
minicomputers and even mainframes 
compaq detected some minor problems with the chip last month and 
informed intel which has said it would begin shipping a fixed 
version of the chip by the end of this month 
the uncertainty about the new chip combined with slowing sales 
in the american market prompted compaq last week to announce that 
its fourthquarter earnings would be below those of a year ago 
that announcement triggered a 15 percent plunge in the price of 
compaq stock 
on monday however compaqs stock jumped 75 cents a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading closing at 8925 
the new deskpro 486 will be offered in three models ranging in 
price from 13999 to 20499 with first shipments expected at 
compaq dealers by late december or january 
the systempro also in three versions ranges from 15999 to 
25999 with shipments to begin in december 
compaq founded in 1982 had worldwide sales last year of about 
2 billion 
the companys phenomenal growth came as it made computers that 
followed the ibm standard compaq however refused to follow ibm 
in 1987 when ibm brought out its personal system2 line using a 
new data pathway known as micro channel 
compaq and eight other personal computer makers deny ibms 
assertion that micro channel is the way of the future and say they 
have found a way to extend the life of the old data pathway which 
they call extended industry standard architecture or eisa

in an advertising battle against a 
rival cereal makers health claims about oat bran kellogg co has 
launched a 40million campaign touting the cholesterolcutting 
powers of psyllium 
ads monday in usa today and us news amp world report also 
scheduled to run in time and newsweek magazines show a red boxing 
glove holding a stalk of psyllium grain if you think oat bran is 
tough meet the new champ the caption reads 
kellogg is taking a poke at general mills inc which analysts 
say has used an emphasis on oat bran to increase its cereal market 
share to 27 percent from about 22 percent in the past year 
kelloggs share has slipped to 386 percent from more than 40 
percent 
anything that changes the emphasis from oats is in kelloggs 
best interest due to their under representation in the oat bran

shearson lehman hutton inc suffering from a 
continuing slowdown in the financial markets said today that it 
has begun another round of layoffs 
a source said the layoffs could result in as much as 2 percent 
of shearsons work force being cut in the next few weeks 
the layoffs which are expected to affect all departments in the 
securities firm would be the largest on wall street this year 
shearson notified its 38500 employees of its decision monday in 
a twoparagraph internal newsletter said company spokesman steven 
faigen 
the layoff process began yesterday he said 
faigen declined to provide details on the layoffs saying only 
that several hundred employees would lose their jobs in the 
next few weeks 
however a company source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said as many as 800 people or 2 percent of the work force could 
be cut 
shearson and other securities firms are expected to show a 
decline in trading profits this year as a result of the stock 
markets plunge of last month and the general pressure on takeover 
stocks 
the wariness of individual investors since the october 1987 
stock market crash continues to hurt the securities industry 
securities firms in new york city alone have cut nearly 18000 jobs 
from a peak of 163000 two years ago 
in its internal newsletter shearson said the job cuts were 
decided after reviewing expenses and in light of an impending move 
by a number of its employees to a new office building 
the decision to further reduce expenses of all kinds reflects 
the continued slowdown of activity and the recurring overcapacity 
in the financial markets the newsletter said 
the steps announced today are designed to improve overall 
productivity and ensure that appropriate resources are focused on 
the business areas with the highest potential for growth and future 
profitability it said 
last year shearson laid off about 1200 employees and since 
then it has trimmed another 300 jobs 
shearson a subsidiary of financial services giant american 
express co is the secondlargest securities firm in the nation 
behind merrill lynch amp co 
for the first three quarters of this year shearson earned 106 
million or 98 cents a share down 3 percent from earnings of 110 
million or 105 a share last year revenue rose to 96 billion 
from 76 billion but expenses also climbed to 94 billion from 
75 billion

the federal official in charge of bailing out the 
savings and loan industry says hell soon have to call a halt to 
thrift institution rescues unless the administration and congress 
swiftly resolve a politically touchy financing dispute 
legislation enacted in august provides 50 billion for closing 
or rescuing sampls to a new agency the resolution trust corp but 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman who is 
in charge of the rtc says it needs to temporarily borrow at least 
an additional 50 billion which would be repaid as the agency sold 
loans and real estate acquired from failed sampls 
without the temporary funds the rtc could raise cash either by 
the quick sale of properties once owned by sampls a move likely to 
unsettle already depressed real estate markets or it will have to 
keep moneylosing sampls open adding to the burden on taxpayers he 
said 
we are very close to being out of funds to resolve 
institutions without additional funds this is a matter of weeks 
not months seidman said after delivering a speech monday to the 
97th annual convention of the us league of savings institutions 
however in washington daniel p kearney president of the 
administration board that oversees the rtc contradicted seidman 
he told a house banking panel that the initial 50 billion should 
last through next year 
the bailout agency has handled 33 thrift failures so far has 
another 260 institutions under its control and expects to take over 
200 to 300 more in coming months 
but it is caught in a dispute between the administration which 
wants the additional borrowing kept out of the federal budget 
deficit and congressional democrats who would swell the deficit 
by tens of billions of dollars increasing pressure on president 
bush to agree to a tax increase 
thats obviously a hot political question were kind of 
caught in the middle seidman said 
rep dan rostenkowski dill who as chairman of the house ways 
and means committee is one of the key legislators pressing for the 
sampl borrowing to be on budget told 3600 convention delegates 
that congress and the administration are acting irresponsibly in 
avoiding consideration of a tax increase 
we must stop pretending that taxes must not be part of the 
debate and start talking about the fairest and most efficient way 
to raise revenue he said everything has to be on the table 
all taxes and all spending 
meanwhile seidman questioned whether two provisions of the sampl 
law were hurting the industrys longrun prospects one forces sampls 
starting july 1991 to devote 70 percent of their assets to housing 
up from 60 percent currently the other imposes higher deposit 
insurance premiums on thrifts compared with commercial banks 
he said thrifts must be able to diversify to avoid becoming 
overly dependent on any one line of business he said there must be 
a level playing field on deposit insurance premiums 
in another development james barth chief economist of the 
office of thrift supervision disclosed that sampl industry losses in 
the julyseptember quarter were at least 25 billion a large 
amount but still the best showing since the industry reported 18 
billion in red ink in the third quarter of last year 
that brings losses for the first nine months of 1989 to 97 
billion about the same pace as last years record 134 billion 
loss 
barth also said asset levels and deposit flows in september show 
that sampls are striving to meet tough new capital standards 
announced monday and effective dec 7 by shrinking their 
portfolios rather than by raising new capital 
in september thrifts sold 15 billion in assets up from a 
record 134 billion in august deposit outflows totaled about 9 
billion up from 51 billion in august and close to the record 
108 billion in january he said 
the standards required by sampl bailout legislation enacted three 
months ago are intended to provide a bigger cushion of capital to 
absorb losses before an institution fails and federal deposit 
insurance kicks in 
the thrift office estimated that 800 of the nations 2600 
solvent sampls holding about 45 percent of the industrys 13 
trillion in assets fall nearly 20 billion short of the new 
capital standard

cashstarved braniff inc has suspended all 
regular passenger flights jeopardizing some 1800 jobs and 
angering employees who had stuck with the airline during two 
bankruptcy proceedings 
these people that bought braniff they need to be put on trial 
by braniff employees and taken out for a public flogging leo 
bailey a laidoff customer service agent said when he heard the 
news in kansas city mo 
in a statement issued at midnight monday braniff said the 
action was taken to preserve assets while a reorganization plan is 
developed and a sale of the airline is considered 
there were no immediate reports of passengers being stranded by 
the suspension of braniffs 46 daily passenger flights 
in orlando today braniffs headquarter offices and ticket 
counters were empty and no passengers were seen 
i think the impact is not going to be that severe in that many 
people have booked on other airlines i think the word was out and 
people were booking elsewhere said dave napoli assistant 
general manager at kansas city international airport where braniff 
had operated 20 daily flights 
about 30 braniff planes were parked at the airport this morning 
napoli said 
the company advised ticketholders to check if other airlines 
would honor the tickets people who bought tickets with a credit 
card were told to consult with the card company and those who 
purchased tickets with cash or a check after sept 28 were given a 
tollfree number to call for a refund 
the suspension of flights came as a surprise to many of the 
employees who remained with the airline after it filed for 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy code sept 28 for the second time 
were all in shock said jim hamilton a braniff pilot based 
in dallas we were hoping that someone would buy braniff and want 
to run it but maybe there was nothing left to buy its just a 
case of complete mismanagement 
braniff didnt address the possibility of layoffs other than to 
say employees would be notified of their status a prospect that 
left union officials frustrated 
what a mess said vo dellefemine executive director of 
the aircraft mechanics fraternal association upon hearing the news 
in rhode island 
ever since the bankruptcy upper management has given no 
response no answer to the employees of the company said charlie 
stitz of gladstone mo a braniff flight attendant who was called 
back to work nov 1 
bia acquisitions an investor group formed by painewebber inc 
bought braniff in june for about 100 million and became the 
airlines third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy reorganization 
braniff had 4800 employees when it filed for bankruptcy again 
in september at the time it said it was cutting the number of 
cities served from 36 to 11 san diego los angeles san francisco 
phoenix dallas chicago kansas city orlando new york newark 
nj and washington 
the airline had a workforce of about 1800 before the suspension 
of service 
under a courtadministered reorganization plan the company had 
put 46 of its 256 presept 28 flights back in the air by friday 
said sandy smith a spokeswoman at braniff headquarters in orlando 
but the effort was doomed by a cash shortage she said 
we didnt come up with any other alternative financing and 
options like that there just wasnt any more cash smith said 
the last flights were arriving at about the time of the 
announcement and the planes would remain at their destinations 
indefinitely smith said 
braniff will try to expand its charter service while studying 
its options including sale of the company said william g mcgee 
chairman president and chief executive officer 
the airline lost 318 million during the first six months of 
this year on sales of 293 million 
on friday braniff laid off about 100 mostly administrative 
employees

communications ministers of the 12 
european community countries disagreed tuesday on a proposed plan 
to liberalize telecommunications services 
the ministers could not decide what powers would be reserved for 
national communications authorities after the proposal would take 
effect at the end of 1992 
but they agreed to continue working through a committee of 
experts and scheduled a meeting for dec 7 at which they hope to 
reach a compromise 
the proposal made by the european commission would enable 
private companies to offer many valueadded telecommunications 
services that are currently reserved for public telephone 
monopolies in some countries 
that proposal is accompanied by another commission initiative 
known as the open network provision which would require public 
telecommunications networks now in the hands of national 
monopolies in most ec countries to be opened to private companies 
for a reasonable fee 
the commission proposal on services ran into objections from 
france which wants to reserve for national authorities the right 
to decide what services and users would have access to the national 
telecommunications grid according to ec sources 
other countries such as west germany and britain argued that 
reserving such powers for national authorities would amount to a 
reregulation of their own more liberalized markets for 
telecommunications services 
the telecommunications proposals are part of the ecs push to 
create a single internal market for goods and services by the end 
of 1992

the nations former chief savings and loan 
regulator testified today that four senators asked him in a 
closeddoor meeting in 1987 to drop a proposed regulation that 
would have curtailed risky investments by lincoln savings and loan 
association 
edwin j gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board told the house banking committee that the request was made 
by sens dennis deconcini dariz john glenn dohio alan 
cranston dcalif and john mccain rariz at an april 2 1987 
meeting in deconcinis office 
sen deconcini said he and the other senators were there 
on behalf of their friend at lincoln savings gray said he 
said that if i withdraw the regulation they would get their 
friend to make more home loans 
it sounded like a quid pro quo he testified it was a 
quid pro quo i told sen deconcini i would not withdraw the 
regulation 
bob maynes a spokesman for deconcini said the arizona senator 
and three other senators have consistently taken issue with grays 
description of the meeting 
there were five people in that room gray and the four 
senators he said in a telephone interview and all four 
senators have said on the record that gray is totally and 
completely inaccurate 
maynes said a description of the meeting provided subsequently 
by william t black of the federal home loan bank boards regional 
office in san francisco supports the senators accounts of what had 
transpired there maynes said blacks account of the meeting was 
based on a briefing he had been given by gray 
the four senators have acknowledged that they received more than 
11 million in political contributions raised by phoenix 
millionaire charles h keating jr chairman of american 
continental corp parent company of the irvine califbased 
lincoln 
the regulation which was put into effect last summer only as 
part of a 157 billion taxpayer bailout of the sampl industry would 
have curtailed lincoln from continuing to invest federallly insured 
deposits in risky real estate ventures 
as the result of those investments which later turned sour the 
government last april sezied control of lincoln at an estimated 
cost of up to 2 billion to taxpayers for repaying savers whose 
federally insured deposits were lost 
sens cranston deconcini glenn and mccain had evidently 
bought off on the scheme when they met with me gray testified 
the receipt of very substantial gifts from charles keating and 
his associates had long since put them in the right frame of mind 
to embrace the notion that there was somehow a vendetta against 
lincoln by regulators 
when enough money flows its apparently easier to be 
gullible gray said 
he recalled that keating also had hired alan greenspan now 
chairman of the federal reserve board and then a private economist 
to press his case that lincolns investments were sound and argue 
against the need for the regulation 
gray also outlined how former treasury secretary and white house 
chief of staff donald t regan orchestrated president reagans 
appointment of lee henkel a business associate of keating to the 
bank board 
charles keating had finally achieved his wish gray said 
mr keating had gotten this far because of his political 
influence translate that as money all the way to and through 
the white house and with friends like sens deconcini mccain 
glenn and cranston what was to stop him 
keating also had been scheduled to testify today but his new 
attorney on monday asked that his appearance be postponed for two 
weeks todays hearing was the fourth held by the banking committee 
on why lincoln was allowed to keep operating for two years after 
federal examiners said it was posing a threat to the governments 
deposit insurance funds 
bank board officials in california recommended on may 1 1987 
that the government seize lincoln because of its mounting losses 
gray whose term expired two months later passed the problem on to 
his successor m danny wall now director of the new office of 
thrift supervision in the treasury department 
lincoln was seized by the bank board in april nearly two years 
after federal examiners first recommended taking it over 
the resolution trust corp the agency created by congress to 
clean up the thrift mess filed a 11 billion suit in september 
against lincoln american continental keating and his relatives 
alleging fraud and racketeering 
wall has acknowledged he met with keating after taking office 
and said he subsequently rejected the recommendation of the boards 
regional office in san francisco to take lincoln over 
he has defended the action saying the san francisco officials 
had enough information to restrict some of lincolns activities but 
not enough to warrant taking it over without first going through a 
lengthy court battle 
instead wall ordered that supervision of the troubled thrift be 
transferred to the boards washington headquarters while a second 
audit was conducted by field examiners from other parts of the 
country 
members of the second team testified last week their audit was 
hampered by directions from bank board officials in washington to 
ignore the previous audits and the high salaries that were paid to 
keating and his relatives

northrop corps b2 stealth bomber program 
cheated the government out of more than 20 billion according to a 
revised lawsuit filed by one current and five former northrop 
employees 
the lawsuit exposes one of the most massive frauds ever 
perpetrated in the defense procurement industry said herbert 
hafif attorney for those who filed the suit 
us district judge mariana r pfaelzer on monday unsealed the 
65page suit which raises the estimate of the alleged fraud from 
between 400 million and 1 billion as was estimated in the initial 
suit filed in february 1988 
northrop was doing more than simply mischarging or supplying 
false parts or falsifying tests said hafif 
the suit says northrop lacked the current historical pricing 
data and technical knowhow to develop and build the batshaped 
aircraft which is designed to elude radar and which made its first 
flight last summer 
hafif has filed several other suits on behalf of current or 
former employees against the aerospace company whose stock price 
has sagged following repeated allegations of wrongdoing and fears 
that congress may cancel the b2 bomber as too expensive 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio said the company had not had 
time to study the amended lawsuit but he said allegations in the 
original complaint had never been substantiated noting that the 
government has not intervened in the case as it is allowed to do 
in such whistleblower suits 
the last time he hafif made an attack on the b2 program 
the government investigated for eight months and found there was no 
basis for intervention cantafio said 
assistant us attorney howard daniels declined to say if 
government lawyers were reconsidering whether to intervene in light 
of the new allegations 
separately tuesday northrop president and chief executive kent 
kresa tried to reassure a group of financial analysts in new york 
that production of the b2 was going ahead and that northrop 
remains on firm ground kresa noted that a senatehouse conference 
committee had authorized production of two b2s in 1990 and 
continued funding for five more in 1991 
the whistleblower suit enables the plaintiffs to share in treble 
damages with the government if it succeeds 
the suit alleges northrop originally misrepresented its ability 
to undertake the b2 bomber project in 1980 and subsequently 
misrepresented its progress at each level of development of the 
plane 
northrop originally promised to build 132 b2s by 1993 for about 
40 billion but the government now estimates it will cost 70 
million if it is completed

black amp decker inc has settled a twoyear 
dispute with the federal trade commission over the use of safety 
claims in advertisements for its automatic shutoff irons 
although the ads were pulled shortly after the ftc raised 
objections to their use in 1987 black amp decker until monday had 
refused to accept ftc guidelines restricting the use of private 
laboratory claims in product advertisements 
the conflict revolved around the companys use of an endorsement 
from the michiganbased national fire safety council inc which 
had given the iron its exclusive certification of safety after 
it was hired by black amp decker to conduct tests on its product 
the ftc has questioned the use of such claims in ads because it 
believes they give consumers the mistaken impression that the 
endorsement is sanctioned by an official agency 
black amp decker began using the national fire safety councils 
endorsement in 1987 but pulled the advertisement that year after 
the ftc raised questions about the councils qualifications and 
testing procedures said howard e geltzer a spokesman for the 
company 
one of the ads in the campaign said all irons should come 
with this seal only one does 
the ad displayed the safety council seal and a photograph of the 
automatic shutoff iron which was introduced in 1984 as the first 
clothes iron to beep and turn itself off automatically when left on 
and unattended for several minutes 
geltzer said black amp decker used the councils endorsement under 
the assumption that it was qualified to make such certifications 
but the ftc suggested that black amp decker officials knew the 
council was not equipped to make firesafety judgments and it 
accused the appliance manufacturer of using false and 
misleading advertisements

insurance companies should find it easier to 
sue in federal court to challenge compensation awards to injured 
workers following a supreme court decision tuesday 
the justices by an 81 vote allowed an illinois insurance 
company to go to federal court to challenge a worker compensation 
award to a texas man 
the court said insurers may sue in federal court even though the 
employer they insure is based in the same state as the injured 
worker as long as the insurance company is from another state 
than the opposing side 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said federal 
law bars such federal lawsuits when insurance companies are sued 
but the law clearly does not apply when the insurance companies 
are doing the suing marshall said 
the distinction may seem incongruous marshall said but he 
added we cannot doubt that congress meant what it said 
the case stems from a compensation claim awarded larry w brewer 
for an injury he suffered on april 4 1986 while working for 
whitmire line clearance inc in lamar county texas 
legal papers submitted to the high court did not describe 
brewers job his injuries or the size of the compensation award 
northbrook national insurance co based in illinois insures 
whitmire for worker compensation claims the insurance firm went to 
federal court in 1987 to challenge the award to brewer made by the 
texas industrial accident board 
a federal judge threw out the insurers suit and the ruling was 
upheld by the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
at issue was a doctrine called diversity jurisdiction which 
gives federal courts authority to rule on civil disputes when the 
opposing sides are from different states 
justice john paul stevens in a lone dissent said worker 
compensation is primarily a matter of local interest with which 
federal courts have only minimal contact 
the case is northbrook vs brewer 88995

the large discount chain walmart stores inc on tuesday said 
its thirdquarter profit climbed 29 percent boosted by strong 
sales growth 
specialty apparel retailer limited inc posted a 21 percent gain 
in its thirdquarter income on a 10 percent increase in sales 
walmart the countrys third largest retailer announced its 
aftertax earnings rose to 2327 million or 41 cents a share in 
the three months ended oct 31 from 1809 million or 32 cents a 
share in 1988s third quarter 
sales at the stores walmart operates in 27 states totaled 628 
billion in the third quarter up from 499 billion a year earlier 
at the end of the quarter the bentonville arkbased retailer 
had 1347 walmart stores 118 sams wholesale clubs 14 dot 
discount drug stores and three hypermart usa units walmart ranks 
third in terms of sales after industry leader sears roebuck and 
co and no2 k mart corp 
david glass president and chief executive officer said 
walmarts thirdquarter performance reflects attention to customer 
service disciplined inventory management and merchandising 
programs 
we expect the fourth quarter to be highly competitive but 
believe our inventory levels our associates involvement and 
continued efforts at exceeding our customers expectations will 
enable us to meet our goals and objectives glass said in a news 
release 
for the first nine months of walmarts financial year income 
rose 26 percent to 65004 million or 115 a share from 51404 
million or 91 cents a share through three quarters of 1988

billion from 101 billion 
leslie h waxner chairman and chief executive officer said 
limited pursued a cautious strategy during the autumn keeping 
inventories below last years level on a square foot basis 
my view was that the general economy was softening and lacked 
strong consumer demand waxner said i believe our third 
quarter earnings are a reflection of that conservative inventory 
position 
he said business in the third quarter was focused 
conservatively on the quality of sales and profitability 
waxner expressed a more upbeat attitude toward the fourth 
quarter which is a crucial time for retailers 
the current success of our merchandising effort and the 
acceptance of our fashion direction gives us more optimism as we 
enter the fourth quarter waxner said 
retailers pick up about a third of their annual revenues and a 
half or more of their yearly profits in the twomonth peak holiday 
shopping season

shearson lehman hutton inc continued laying off 
employees tuesday in a cutback that could total 2 percent of its 
work force by years end and experts predicted other securities 
firms would make similar reductions in coming months due to a 
continued slowdown in the financial markets 
its not a problem just for shearson everybody has it said 
perrin long who follows the industry for lipper analytical 
securities corp in new york i think well be seeing several 
cutbacks but in smaller numbers to avoid a lot of media 
attention 
shearson and other wall street firms particularly retail 
brokerages catering to individual investors have been under 
increasing pressure in recent months to trim costs in the face of 
rising operating expenses 
most are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year 
due to the stock markets october plunge and the general pressure 
on takeover stocks which had been the driving force behind the 
markets earlier advances 
the lingering wariness of individual investors since the october 
1987 stock market crash also has hurt the industry 
i wouldnt sit here and wait for his individual investors 
imminent return in size said james p hanbury a securities 
analyst with wertheim schroeder amp co in new york with business 
slow and expenses high somethings got to give 
total employment by new york stock exchangemember brokerages 
has fallen about 10 percent from a peak of 262173 employees in 
september 1987 to 229455 by mid1989 the firms had added about 
120000 employees from 1980 to the time of the crash 
the decline since then coincides with a steady slowing in the 
growth of revenue jeffrey schaefer director of research for 
securities industry association an industry trade group said 
overall revenue grew from 50 billion in 1986 to 52 billion last 
year although revenue rose to 60 billion by mid1989 it was 
expected to drop off by the end of the fourth quarter he said 
shearson second only to merrill lynch amp co in terms of the 
number of us retail brokerage offices began laying off some of 
its 38500 employees monday and notified others in a twoparagraph 
newsletter that more acrosstheboard cuts were planned said 
company spokesman steven faigen 
shearson cited among other things the slowdown of market 
activity which includes the buying and selling of stocks and bonds 
that generates commissions and trading profits 
shearson a subsidiary of financial services giant american 
express co earned 106 million or 98 cents a share during the 
first three months of this year that was off 3 percent from 
earnings of 110 million or 105 a share last year 
faigen declined to provide details on shearsons layoffs and 
said only that several hundred employees would lose their jobs 
in the next few weeks but a company source speaking on condition 
of anonymity said as many as 800 people or 2 percent of the total 
work force could be cut that would be the largest staff reduction 
on wall street this year 
a year ago shearson laid off about 1200 employees since then 
it has trimmed another 300 jobs 
other wall street firms have retrenched in varying degrees this 
past year 
last week drexel burnham lambert inc laid off more than 100 
employees in its taxable fixedincome sales division the firm had 
announced earlier this year that it was selling its entire retail 
brokerage division of 2300 workers over the past three years it 
has more than halved its work force from a peak of about 10000 
among the others first boston corp last spring laid off 200 
employees goldman sachs amp co has let go dozens of bond traders 
and smith barney harris upham amp co laid off about 120 employees 
largely in its municipal bond and stock departments 
long said that in addition to gradual cuts many firms are 
paying close attention to normal attrition and not rehiring

lenient sentences in the princetonnewport 
racketeering case renewed debate tuesday on whether the 
racketeering statute originally designed to fight organized crime 
should be used in whitecollar cases 
opponents of the racketeer and influenced organization act said 
the three and sixmonth sentences given monday indicate that the 
law which carries a maximum term of 20 years was used 
inappropriately in the princetonnewport case 
others said the short sentences were another example of the 
disparate treatment between whitecollar defendants and defendants 
in other crimes 
us district judge robert carter sentenced to prison five 
former officials of princetonnewport partners lp and a former 
drexel burnham lambert inc trader who were convicted july 31 in 
the first racketeering trial of securities professionals 
the case drew wide criticism because of the use of the 
racketeering law which allows prosecutors to freeze a defendants 
assets before trial the statute also allows forfeiture of 
illgotten gains upon conviction 
several defense lawyers who were interviewed tuesday also said 
carters sentences were a reflection of recent revisions in justice 
department rules governing the use of the racketeering law 
the changes included restricting the use of tax violations on 
which the princetonnewport case was based in bringing 
racketeering charges 
i think the sentences reflect that these kinds of cases are 
not appropriate for rico and it was wrong to use the statute in the 
first place said defense attorney michael armstrong 
armstrong represents lowell milken the brother of former drexel 
burnham lambert inc junkbond chief michael milken in their 
racketeering and fraud case much of the same evidence from the 
princetonnewport case is expected to be introduced at the milkens 
trial scheduled for march 1990 
the princetonnewport case involved a series of prearranged 
stock transactions between 1984 and 1986 the government alleged 
that the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to generate 
phony tax losses 
princetonnewport based in princeton nj and in newport 
beach calif went out of business after the indictment was 
brought in august 1988 defense lawyers said at the time that the 
charges alone destroyed the firm 
armstrong said that the financial repercussions of rico 
including the potential loss of a business place unfair pressure 
on whitecollar defendants to try to settle the charges through a 
plea bargain 
its been used by certain prosecutors in the last few years as 
a blackjack to threaten people involved in perfectly normal kinds 
of disputes with the extreme racketeering penalties that the statue 
provided even before trial he said so you had people who 
feared the unknown of an extreme penalty pleading guilty to avoid 
it even though in their own minds they hadnt done anything wrong 
michael goldsmith a law professor at brigham young university 
called carters sentences an outrage 
i believe that his handling of this case will become a classic 
example in law books of disparate treatment between whitecollar 
defendants and street crime defendants said goldsmith who also 
serves as vice chairman of the american bar associations criminal 
justice section rico committee 
he said the new policies of the justice department were simply 
an effort to impose highlevel control over the types of cases 
brought under rico something he said government officials had been 
doing all along 
the key point is that it is true that rico was written 
primarily with organized crime in mind he said however the 
legislative record is clear that congress also intended to strike 
at longterm systemic whitecollar crime 
harvey goldschmid a securities law professor at columbia 
university law school played down the importance of the 
princetonnewport sentences 
the sentences obviously reflects some sense of this group 
suffering a great deal goldschmid said if i were on wall 
street given the special circumstances here i wouldnt take great 
comfort in the prospect that this the relatively lenient 
sentences will occur too often in the future

drexel burnham lambert inc the prime booster 
of the junk bond market unveiled a new index tuesday to track the 
performance of these highyield securities and said improvement in 
this troubled market may be near 
about the time that everyone declares the highyield market is 
dead it will rebound said john f sorte a drexel executive vice 
president this is a cyclical business 
drexel said its new highyield index will track the performance 
of about 700 junk bond issues or about twothirds of the 200 
billion in outstanding junk bonds it replaces a narrower junk bond 
index that monitored 110 issues 
the new index which drexel said is the result of months of 
research should provide a much broader and clearer picture of the 
prices of junkbond issues which often are difficult to track due 
to the thin trading in this market 
unlike highyield indexes compiled by some other investment 
houses drexels index will track actual price changes of all the 
bonds it follows the prices will be provided by traders who deal 
in these issues the socalled matrix indexes compiled by some 
other wall street companies use the prices of a few benchmark bonds 
to calculate the overall markets performance 
the monthly drexel index tracks total return on junk bonds 
which includes any price changes plus interest payments 
drexel said the growth of the junk bond market in recent years 
prompted it to devise the new index which includes the newer 
variations in highyield bonds such as deferredinterest bonds 
interestreset bonds and zero coupon bonds 
highyield bonds are those rated below investment grade by the 
credit rating agencies they typically are issued by small 
companies or those lacking a credit history they also are used to 
raise money for leveraged buyouts in which a group buying a 
company pledges as collateral the companys assets 
since they carry a higher risk of default than investmentgrade 
bonds junk bonds yield more interest 
while saying reports of the death of the junk bond market are 
premature sorte told reporters the leveraged buyout business that 
fueled the issuance of highyield debt should remain slow for the 
foreseeable future 
the lbo market was sent in a tailspin when several large highly 
publicized deals began to come apart earlier this year some 
junkbond issuers such as canadian retailer campeau corp and merv 
griffins resorts international said they would have trouble 
paying interest on their junk bonds raising questions about the 
viability of the highyield market 
sorte said two factors have crimped the lbo business the cost 
of raising funds has risen due to the junk bond troubles and 
investors in these deals are demanding that they involve less debt

the stock market rallied tuesday amid renewed 
investor optimism that the federal reserve might move to lower 
interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials finished 1496 points 
higher at 259713 after a sharp loss on monday 
wall street observers said the feds addition of reserves to the 
banking system through customer repurchase agreements sparked a 
rise in the bond market that helped boost stock prices 
investors interpreted the feds action as evidence that the next 
move could be an easing of the discount rate said michael metz 
equities analyst with oppenheimer amp co the discount rate is the 
interest the central bank charges its member banks 
investors were in the mood to listen to favorable rumors and 
seized on this as a rationalization to nibble a bit said metz 
adding that such an interest rate move by the fed was unlikely 
investors hope for a decline in shortterm interest rates to 
revive sagging corporate profitability in the fourth quarter 
analysts said on monday the dow jones industrial average fell 
4734 points on what analysts said was a response to unexpectedly 
weak thirdquarter earnings reports and a bleak nearterm outlook 
the yield on longterm treasury bonds fell sharply after the 
feds move reflecting bond investors optimism about a rate cut 
the federal funds rate the interest commercial banks charge each 
other for overnight loans also declined 
we finally got the turn that we needed to stimulate the stock 
market said l crandall hays analyst with robert w baird amp co 
stock prices opened weak then seesawed through the morning 
session following the previous days losses 
analysts also attributed tuesdays gains to bargain hunting and 
technical factors after mondays steep declines

volume on the floor of the big board came to 16300 million

analysts said that program trading a computerized form of 
buying and selling large blocks of stocks has remained a factor in 
price movements but did not cause wide price swings in the last two 
sessions 
program trading is there but its not gotten as volatile as 
whippy as before said ralph bloch chief market analyst for the

a senate subcommittee voted 76 tuesday to 
impose strict new controls on auto exhaust pollution but opponents 
and supporters agreed the issue will be fought over again 
the provision similar in its initial stages to one approved by 
a house subcommittee was passed over the objections of the auto 
industry and the bush administration who contended consumers would 
pay an extra 500 a car as a result 
an initial set of reductions would begin with 1993 models 
making all cars meet standards required in california currently 
more stringent than those in force elsewhere by 2003 an 
additional 50 percent cut in emissions of major pollutants would be 
required 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of the subcommittee disputed 
the 500 figure equating the cost of pollution reductions in the 
next century to the purchase of a nice new hubcap 
the ranking republican sen john h chafee of rhode island 
said the panel should have deferred action until it studied his 
plan to let automakers choose how to reduce harmful emissions early 
in the 21st century 
chafee backed by the administration said the auto companies 
should be able to choose between cutting tailpipe emissions or 
building cars that could run on fuels that burn cleaner than 
gasoline 
we ought to look at oil companies to produce cleaner fuels 
chafee said why should they be let off the hook in doing 
something on clean air 
baucus chief sponsor of the subcommittee legislation said he 
could support a clean fuels amendment but only in addition to the 
second round of tailpipe reductions 
he said a committee hearing on the issue would be held nov 20 
but a fasttrack committee schedule would force the next arguments 
onto the senate floor 
the 76 vote tuesday was a straight partyline split that 
reflected the democratic control of the subcommittee this would 
likely dissolve on the floor where the line would be drawn between 
supporters and opponents of the auto industry 
building cars to run on other fuels is a major feature of 
president bushs clean air proposals which did not propose new 
exhaust pollution reductions 
the senate bills pollution reduction requirements for 
nonmethane hydrocarbons nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide would 
be tougher than those in the major clean air legislation approved 
by a house energy and commerce subcommittee in that they would 
start taking effect a year earlier 
also the house bill would go beyond the california standards to 
requirements resembling the senate provisions only if a study found 
such a course feasible necessary and costeffective the senate 
measure contains no such second look 
the house provisions were the product of a major agreement 
designed to remain that chambers position at least through 
conference committee negotiations expected next year 
rep henry a waxman dcalif subcommittee chairman and a 
backer of environmental groups and rep john d dingell dmich 
committee chairman and a friend of the auto industry negotiated 
the pact to end a decade of feuding that stalled progress on clean 
air legislation 
william rosenberg the environmental protection agencys 
assistant administrator for air programs said it makes a lot of 
sense to let automakers choose the method of reducing motor 
vehicle pollution in the next century 
he said chafees clean fuels alternative which was not 
formally introduced would become effective starting in 1995 
eight years sooner than the senate bills second round of 
reductions he argued that automakers could save consumers 7 
billion by choosing cleanburning fuels over additional tailpipe 
reductions

american stores co awaiting final word on 
whether the merger of its lucky and alpha beta markets violates 
antitrust law said tuesday it had worked out a deal to sell 13 of 
its 36 alpha beta stores in northern california and merge the others 
with lucky operations 
american and the state attorney generals office also agreed that 
if the attorney general wins the antitrust case any additional 
divestitures by american in northern california will be limited to 
1 million a week in sales 
that could amount to as many as seven or eight more stores 
depending on how much business they do deputy attorney general chet 
horn said 
most of the 550 lucky and alpha beta supermarkets are in southern 
california and the divestiture of the 13 stores combined with 
earlier divestitures essentially settles the antitrust case in the 
northern part of the state horn said 
clearly the bulk of the problem was in the south horn said 
he said that in the napa market area in northern california 
american also agreed to open no new stores for three years they 
already have two stores there now horn said 
state attorney general john van de kamp contends that the 25 
billion merger would cost shoppers 400 million a year and has 
taken his suit seeking to block it to the us supreme court which 
has yet to rule on the case 
in the meantime a preliminary injunction issued by us district 
judge david kenyon in los angeles prevents american from going ahead 
with the merger 
american stores in a release from its headquarters in salt lake 
city said it had worked out a deal with van de kamp to allow the 
sale of 13 stores in contra costa monterey san mateo santa clara 
and alameda counties to other supermarket operators 
the remaining stores north of kern san luis obispo and san 
bernardino counties will be integrated into lucky operations

the us postal service is about to begin 
testing peelandstick postage stamps in 15 cities but buyers will 
have to pay extra for the convenience 
eighteen of the 25cent stamps will be sold in a sheet that folds 
into a booklet the price will be 5 50 cents more than the face 
value of the stamps 
it is expected to appeal to consumers willing to pay extra for 
a deluxe product the postal service said in announcing the test 
marketing program 
the stamp which displays artwork of an eagle and shield will go 
on sale for the first time friday at a stamp show in virginia beach 
va 
the 30day test period will follow with sales in atlanta 
chicago cleveland columbus ohio dallas denver houston 
indianapolis kansas city los angeles miami milwaukee 
minneapolis phoenix and st louis 
collectors may order the stamps from the agencys philatelic 
sales division washington dc 202659997 
it will be the second selfadhesive stamp offered by the postal 
service a selfsticking christmas stamp was issued in 1974 but 
problems were encountered with the glue postal officials say they 
believe they have solved those problems 
market research indicated that consumers place a high value on 
the new features we are offering and feel it is appropriate to 
charge extra for them said assistant postmaster general gordon c 
morison 
by selling the new product in 15 major cities and soliciting 
consumer responses we will be able to make a sound decision about 
future production for national distribution he said 
postal officials say the new stamps will not become stuck 
together in humid weather and the glue will act slowly enough to 
allow them to be repositioned on envelopes 
in addition the adhesive is water soluble so that after use the 
stamps may be soaked off envelopes by collectors

attorneys in the hunt bankruptcy reorganization 
case say theyre not sure they can meet a federal bankruptcy judges 
order that a settlement be reached or the assets will be liquidated 
bankruptcy judge harold abramson on monday cited the continuing 
drain on the estate of exbillionaire william herbert hunt in 
announcing he would convert the case from a chapter 11 
reorganization to chapter 7 liquidation on nov 20 
the ruling gives major creditors just two weeks to work out a 
compromise that they have failed to reach since the oilman and son 
of the late hl hunt filed for bankruptcy in september 1988 
we were happy the judge gave us two weeks to fix it he could 
have just converted it today said stephen mccartin of gardere amp 
wynne hunts attorney 
other attorneys werent so optimistic saying privately that they 
doubted the gap between two major creditors in the case could be 
bridged in such a short time 
if it is converted to chapter 7 the remaining assets of hunts 
once vast estate would be sold off rapidly with most of the 
proceeds going to the internal revenue service the largest creditor 
in the case with a claim of 300 million in back taxes 
the judge also said the continued litigation facing the estate 
was drying up what few proceeds remained 
the court cannot continue to sit by idly while this 
continues judge abramson said 
under bankruptcy procedures creditors and the debtor file 
reorganization plans and try to reach a consensus on repayment of 
debt plans have been filed by hunt and three major creditors but 
the judge said monday that none of the reorganization plans before 
him were confirmable 
the ruling has no impact on herberts brother nelson bunker 
hunt who also sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 
last year 
herbert hunt who was on hand with his wife nancy to hear the 
decision has assets currently valued at 125 million to satisfy 
debts of nearly 900 million bankruptcy court filings show 
a chapter 7 liquidation of herbert hunts estate would reap 60 
million to 70 million or roughly half the 125 million that would 
be divided among creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code 
hundreds of smaller creditors would get nothing if the estate is 
liquidated under chapter 7 attorneys involved in the case say 
i am quite disappointed i think this is a disaster for the 
unsecured creditors said claude d montgomery attorney for the 
bankruptcy trustee in the hunt international resources corp case 
the stuff in this estate is incredibly illiquid said thomas 
o gorman an attorney representing minpeco sa a major creditor 
in the case it just depends on whether they have to sell it all 
tomorrow 
the ruling was prompted by the ongoing dispute between minpeco a 
mining concern owned by the peruvian government and manufacturers 
hanover trust co a new york bank that has a 36 million claim in 
the case 
manufacturers hanover says its claim should have priority over a 
132 million judgment minpeco is trying to collect from the two hunt 
brothers the judgment which has swelled to more than 250 million 
with interest and attorneys fees stems from the hunts silver 
conspiracy case

the house gave final congressional approval 
tuesday to legislation creating a congressional panel to investigate 
the 8monthold strike against eastern airlines a measure the bush 
administration has threatened to veto 
the bill approved on a voice vote is a watereddown version of 
organized labors initial attempt to get congress to demand that 
president bush intervene in the strike something the president 
refused to do when the walkout began march 4 
the idea for a fourmember congressional panel was substituted 
for the initial bill demanding that bush use his power to halt the 
strike and name an emergency board to settle the dispute in 
refusing to intervene in march bush said the dispute should be 
settled by easterns unions and management and that emergency 
situations justifying intervention did not exist 
a month ago the administration in a statement issued by the 
office of management and budget threatened to veto the legislation 
creating the commission which was approved by the senate last week 
omb said tuesday that position had not changed 
labor urged bush to reconsider 
the house now joins the senate in an action long overdue 
aflcio president lane kirkland said in a statement we urge the 
president to quickly sign this bill into law for the president to 
do otherwise would strip the administration of any pretense of 
fairness in this dispute 
in a separate development eastern again asked a federal 
bankruptcy court to extend its exclusive right to submit a proposed 
reorganization plan and its deadline for detailing how that plan 
would work 
eastern filed a motion monday asking us bankruptcy judge burton 
r lifland to extend the exclusivity period for its reorganization 
plan by 60 days to jan 12 during that period other parties to the 
case cannot file reorganization proposals for eastern under chapter 
11 of the us bankruptcy code 
the miamibased airline also requested a 30day extension to 
dec 13 of the deadline for filing its disclosure statement which 
is designed to provide details of how it intends to emerge from 
bankruptcy eastern which was struck by its pilots machinists and 
flight attendants on march 4 in an ongoing walkout has hired 
replacement workers and is rebuilding as a smaller carrier 
lifland has not yet set a date for considering easterns 
requests airline spokesman robin matell said tuesday from miami he 
said the requests were motivated by the size and complexity of 
easterns bankruptcy proceeding 
lifland previously had granted eastern two extensions of its 
exclusivity period and one deferred deadline for filing the 
disclosure statement 
under the bill passed by the house a democrat and a republican 
from the house and one each from the senate would be appointed by 
their respective party leaders in congress to the commission which 
would make recommendations on how to settle the strike and on 
maintaining competitiveness in the airline industry the panel also 
would make recommendations on how to protect employee collective 
bargaining rights in bankruptcy proceedings involving airlines 
the report would be due 45 days after enactment 
its recommendations should they include presidential 
intervention would not be binding on bush but could lead to 
additional legislation 
the unions have contended that texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo easterns owner has siphoned eastern cash and assets for 
the parent company and wants to use bankruptcy to kill the unions 
as he did when texas air bought continental airlines which emerged 
from bankruptcy protection as a nonunion carrier 
texas air has said concessions by easterns union workers were 
necessary for it to remain competitive 
in another development a meeting of the eastern creditors 
committee scheduled for tuesday in new york was canceled 
adam harris an attorney representing the creditors panel was 
not immediately available to explain why the session was called off 
easterns creditors have been studying the companys revised 
reorganization plan drawn up after attempts to sell its latin 
american routes to american airlines fell through the creditors 
committee had been scheduled to vote on the revised plan on tuesday 
sources close to the situation said late last month that 
creditors were near agreement on accepting easterns revised plan 
after the committee dropped plans to develop alternatives to the 
companys proposal

datapoint corp shareholder martin s ackerman 
said tuesday he is terminating his consent solicitation in a bid to 
oust company chairman asher b edelman and his board of directors 
we are pleased by the broad based support received from many 
independent datapoint shareholders ackerman said in a statement 
at this point we have terminated our consent solicitation and are 
reviewing all our options which include continuing to seek relief in 
the federal and delaware courts 
ackerman and edelman have been battling in state court in 
delaware and federal court in new york 
representatives of datapoint did not immediately return telephone 
calls tuesday 
in his statement ackerman said he received consents to replace 
edelman that represent about 31 percent of the outstanding datapoint 
shares edelman controls about 40 percent of datapoint stock 
ackerman has challenged edelmans purchase in september of about 
30 percent of the companys stock ackerman said that purchase made 
it virtually impossible for his consent solicitation to succeed 
without judicial relief 
datapoint meanwhile has claimed ackerman launched his 
stockholder solicitation without filing disclosures required by 
federal law 
the consent solicitation had to be complete within 60 days of 
ackermans original consent on sept 7 
ackerman blamed edelman for datapoint financial problems 
in securities and exchange commission documents he claimed that 
since edelman took control of datapoint in 1985 its stock value has 
declined about 58 percent during a period in which the standard amp 
poors composite index increased 81 percent
