president reagan said thursday he believes 
republican dan quayles performance in the vice presidential debate 
headed off or should have headed off all this picking on him 
that has been going on 
i think he handled himself very well reagan told reporters 
who questioned him at a state dinner for president moussa traore of 
mali 
i really think that quayle actually just by the whole nature 
of the event headed off or should have headed off all this 
picking on him that has been going on the president said 
reagan also said that some of the points that the democrats were 
claiming were made by bentsen in the debate were based on things 
that were not factually true such as who is responsible for the 
deficit and so forth 
reagan who is making a campaign trip to michigan on friday 
said he will be picking up the pace of his involvement in the 
campaign between now and election day 
asked whether he thought the issues were being addressed in the 
campaign he said yes i do at least by our side 
earlier posing for photographers before a private meeting with 
traore reagan was asked whether he thought quayle would be damaged 
by the exchange in which democrat lloyd bentsen criticized him for 
comparing himself with the late president john f kennedy 
no he said i thought that remark was a cheap shot and 
unbecoming a senator of the united states 
when asked if it was a mistake for quayle to make the comparison 
in the first place reagan said no the only comparison he was 
making was that he was being attacked i think unfairly on the 
basis of his age and his experience in government and he was 
pointing out that john kennedy who sought the highest office and 
won it had actually less experience in government than he had and 
was the same age

president corazon aquino has banned 
foreign trips by administration officials except in urgent cases 
approved by her according to a presidential order published today 
mrs aquino who has visited eight countries hong kong and the 
vatican since she came to power in 1986 said the limit to foreign 
travel was necessary to conserve money and compel officials to 
perform their chores at home 
these officials should be on hand to efficiently and 
effectively manage their respective offices and be available to 
respond immediately and decisively to matters that require their 
attention she said 
manila newspapers said mrs aquino issued the order because many 
officials were traveling abroad too frequently 
during the last two years mrs aquino has traveled to

kidnappers holding two americans 
threatened the hostages safety thursday in venting their anger 
over proposals to send un troops to police lebanons stalled 
presidential elections 
a christian militia leader on thursday called for un troops in 
beirut a day after france suggested the idea 
the kidnappers warning came in a typewritten statement in 
arabic from the revolutionary justice organization the statement 
was delivered to the beirut independent newspaper annahar along 
with a polaroid picture of us hostage joseph james cicippio 
we shall use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies 
including the card of the safety of the hostages which we shall 
make the backbone of our confrontation the statement said 
the photograph showed cicippio 58 of valley forge pa in a 
navy blue track suit with red stripes sitting on a blanketcovered 
bed his hands were clasped in his lap and he was smiling as he 
faced the camera but he looked considerably thinner than in 
previous pictures released by his captors 
cicippio was acting comptroller at the american university of 
beirut when he was kidnapped on the schools campus on sept 12 
1986 
revolutionary justice believed linked to iran also claims to 
hold edward austin tracy 57 of burlington vt an author who 
was kidnapped oct 21 1986 in moslem west beirut 
the note came three days after another group islamic jihad for 
the liberation of palestine freed mithileshwar singh after 20 
months of captivity singh an indian professor is a legal 
resident of the united states 
singh was kidnapped in beirut with three american colleagues 
who are still captives a us state department team is debriefing 
singh in wiesbaden west germany and an official close to the team 
said singh was providing a lot of raw information that could be 
helpful in learning about americans still held in lebanon 
the official spoke on condition of anonymity 
the americans held with singh are jesse turner 41 a native of 
boise idaho alann steen 49 of boston and robert polhill 54 
of new york city 
sixteen foreigners including nine americans are missing in 
lebanon and believed held hostage the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
thursdays statement from cicippios kidnappers denounced the 
rude call for imperialist intervention under the slogan of 
internationalization by a colonial power whose black history is 
mothering our present tragedies 
this appeared to be a reference to france which proposed this 
week dispatching a un peacekeeping force to beirut to oversee 
election of a new president in lebanon a former french colony 
two rival moslem and christian governments emerged in lebanon 
after parliament failed to elect a new head of state to succeed 
president amin gemayel when his sixyear term expired sept 22 
the communique accused rightwing christian militants of 
collaborating with israel iraq and the north atlantic treaty 
organization to partition lebanon as a first step to turning it 
into an israeli satellite and a nato base for intrigues against 
the people of the region 
it called the christian militants the grandsons of the 
crusaders and warned we shall mete out the just punishment to 
the conspirators 
it was the first communique from revolutionary justice since 
july 7 when the group threatened to punish hostages for the 
us downing of an iranian jetliner over the persian gulf 
moslems who make up 55 percent of lebanons 4 million people 
have been fighting for an equal share of power in the nations 
13yearold civil war 
christian militia commander samir geagea on thursday echoed 
frances call for un peacekeepers in beiruts christian and 
moslem sectors to oversee presidential elections 
i propose the formation of a un force to deploy in the 
greater beirut to oversee the presidential election geagea said 
in an interview with the associated press 
geagea said the plan should include withdrawal of his lebanese 
forces militia from christian east beirut and of syrian troops and 
allied leftist and moslem militiamen from the citys western sector 
asked whether the proposed un force should remain after 
parliament elects a new president geagea said it is for the new 
president and the new cabinet he forms to decide that

in december 1985 when 248 
soldiers and eight crewmen died in a plane crash in gander 
newfoundland the remains were dug out of the ice and snow and 
transferred here to be identified and prepared for burial 
nearly 400 servicemen stationed at dover air force base 
volunteered to work around the clock at the gruesome task cleaning 
the building running errands putting together uniforms all to 
see that the bodies were returned to their families before 
christmas 
the long hours in which the tragic became the mundane inevitably 
led to a special kind of stress and that in turn led to a special 
kind of counseling at this base which serves as the us 
militarys morgue and mortuary 
the counseling program for the volunteers is called critical 
incident stress debriefing 
the debriefing process is basically designed to help normal 
people deal with exposure to overwhelming and traumatic events 
in terms of dealing with it personally emotionally and 
professionally said michael j robinson director of the base 
family support center 
what ended up happening robinson said recalling the 
aftermath of the gander crash was that early on probably about 
four days into the operation people began to notice that people 
were having a lot of trouble coping dealing functioning 
and a lot of the behavior we saw people dealing with were 
situations that you find in battle fatiguelike situations combat 
stress situations 
it wasnt the first time for dover air force base 
inside the main door of the mortuary is a simple wooden plaque 
headed significant events listing numbers and faraway place 
names that evoke memories of flagdraped coffins 
the places gander jonestown vietnam the persian gulf are 
reminders of the thousands of dead us servicemen and the 
civilians whose remains have come home through the base 
a nondescript 30000squarefoot building houses the largest 
mortuary operated by the armed services 
its really the largest mortuary in the country said 
charles carson a civilian government employee who started in the 
funeral business in 1950 and who has been in charge of the facility 
for 17 years 
the mortuary can handle up to 100 bodies per day and there is 
storage space for up to 1000 the average workload is 55 to 60 
bodies per month but the average workload is not what the mortuary 
is noted for 
war disasters and terrorist acts the significant events 
have sent 23722 bodies through the mortuary 21693 of them during 
the vietnam war 
the jonestown guyana catastrophe where followers of cult 
leader jim jones committed suicide resulted in 913 deaths in 
november 1978 
the base received the remains of the seven astronauts from the 
space shuttle challenger 
when a major tragedy occurs there is an outpouring of 
volunteers from among the ranks of servicemen stationed at dover 
as in the case of the gander crash the troops on this base they 
really rallied to this thing they really wanted to help carson 
said 
before the remains arrive carson briefs volunteers in an effort 
to determine how they perceive death and whether they have 
hangups about dead bodies 
nearly 200 volunteers were on hand when the bodies of 237 us 
servicemen were returned from beirut lebanon victims of the 
terrorist bombing of a marine barracks in october 1983 
as is most often the case the bodies from beirut were 
identified and embalmed before arriving at dover they were given 
cosmetic work and dressed for burial 
gander was significant because the remains came directly from 
the crash site robinson said 
volunteers working 10 to 14 hours at a stretch were exposed 
to some things the average person has a great deal of trouble 
dealing with 
there were some people who had real physical discomfort 
people who were nauseous we had some people who were coping 
extremely well able to do the job and keep going robinson said 
to help alleviate the stress a mass debriefing was held and 
psychological counseling was offered 
since the gander disaster the defense department and all 
branches of the military have begun to explore the implications of 
the exposure to and the handling of dead bodies 
robinson and four others at the base have taken training courses 
designed mainly to help firefighters police officers and emergency 
medical personnel learn to cope with the intimacy with death that 
they find in their jobs robinson hopes to have at least eight or 
nine people trained at all times 
during the gander disaster base personnel reacted intuitively 
and from knowledge of post traumatic stress disorder robinson 
said adding that officials learned ways to shelter people from 
some of the factors that would increase the likelihood of showing 
longterm effects from post traumatic stress disorder 
during a stress debriefing he said small groups discuss what 
they experienced what it was like for them what was the 
hardest part about that because what we know is that if someone 
talks about exposure to that type of event the likelihood of them 
ending up with longterm post traumatic stress disorder symptoms is 
going to be markedly decreased 
according to robinson volunteers time in the mortuary will be 
reduced in the future once you go past the third and into the 
fourth day you can predict a lot of the things that are going to 
be happening to people emotionally and physically in terms of 
wearing down he said 
as groups are rotated in and out they will probably be debriefed 
and given two days off before being allowed to return 
we know what we need to know now robinson said

the success of this summers bull durham 
has helped lead the way to an outpouring of movies about baseball 
once considered boxoffice poison by the moguls who ran the 
hollywood studios 
during its first month of release bull durham a funny 
sexy account of minorleague baseball starring kevin costner and 
susan sarandon scored 26 million in ticket sales in the united 
states and canada the orion release written and directed by 
former bush league player ron shelton has been followed by eight 
men out and stealing home 
eight men out john sayles drama about baseballs greatest 
scandal the sellout by members of the 1919 chicago white sox 
received a warm welcome from critics stars include charlie sheen 
db sweeney john cusack and christopher lloyd 
jodie foster won raves for her performance in stealing home 
the story of a minor league ballplayer seeking a comeback after 
years on the skids tvs mark harmon costars 
upcoming baseball movies include 
major league with charlie sheen and tom berenger as 
members of a hapless team who suddenly become winners rockystyle 
the scout anson williams directing rodney dangerfield as 
a baseball scout who uncovers a potential superstar it is filming 
this fall 
shoeless joe filming in dubuque iowa with kevin 
costner james earl jones amy madigan and burt lancaster 
according to writerdirector phil alden robinson it is not really 
a baseball movie 
based on a novel by wp kinsella it concerns a farmer 
costner who is told by a spirit that shoeless joe jackson of 
black sox fame will come back to life if he builds a diamond in a 
cornfield 
trading hearts already playing in a few regions a 
romance about a pitcher raul julia who is cut from spring 
training 
producer herb jaffe said trading hearts also is not a 
baseball picture 
thats a hangover from the longheld belief that baseball 
strikes out in theaters the arguments most often heard over the 
years are that baseball is incomprehensible to foreign audiences 
and that women who make up a large part of movie audiences will 
not want to see films about baseball 
thom mount producer of bull durham and part owner of the 
minor league durham nc bulls encountered such prejudice when 
he sought a releasing company 
five studios turned us down before orion picked up bull 
durham he said we were told simply that baseball pictures 
dont make money he attributed the films success to the appeal 
of costner 
also young women are impressed with the role susan sarandon 
plays a strong vital liberated character 
by attracting the female audience bull durham appears to 
have solved one of hollywoods prejudices it remains to be seen 
whether it can also appeal to foreign moviegoers there is hope in 
baseballcrazy japan and the game has been spreading to other 
countries as well given the reasonable cost 9 million bull 
durham is assured of a profit in the domestic market alone 
a survey of baseball movies over the years indicates that the 
studios antibaseball attitude may have been justified even the 
boxoffice luster of robert redford couldnt convert the 
allegorical the natural into a winner 
the bestremembered of baseball movies the pride of the 
yankees with gary cooper as lou gehrig was another commercial 
disappointment 
many other biographical films have failed to excite the 
moviegoing public especially women 
the winning team with ronald reagan as grover cleveland 
alexander the babe ruth story william bendix as the great 
bambino the stratton story james stewart as monty stratton 
who staged a comeback after losing a leg the pride of st 
louis dan dailey jr as dizzy dean the jackie robinson 
story in which the black pioneer in the major leagues played 
himself fear strikes out anthony perkins as jim piersall 
victim of mental illness 
baseball musicals have proved to be only middling hits damn 
yankees with tab hunter and gwen verdon take me out to the 
ballgame with gene kelly esther williams and frank sinatra the 
same with comedies alibi ike joe e brown rhubarb ray 
milland it happens every spring ray milland 
the difficulty of selling a baseball movie to the studios is 
illustrated with eight men out produced oddly enough by 
three women barbara boyle midge sanford and sara pillsbury a 
book about the white sox scandal was optioned in 1980 but the film 
was not made until this year 
we couldnt get a development deal anywhere pillsbury said 
the story had three strikes against it the subject was 
undeniably baseball it was an ensemble piece it was period and 
hence expensive we were told that baseball pictures had never been 
successful especially overseas 
the producers finally made a deal with orion pictures which 
also sponsored bull durham and the scout 
pillsbury thinks eight men out will appeal to women 
baseball is simply the arena that the story takes place in 
she said its more of a human story which is all the more 
exciting because it is true 
the scout also had a tortuous route to the screen the film 
actually went into production in 1982 with peter falk as star then 
was suspended earlier this year orion sent it to kathy 
lymberopoulos producer and associate of rodney dangerfield 
the story she said centers mainly on a baseball scouts life 
and less on the game itself as to any feminine prejudice against 
baseball she added i love baseball and so do a lot of women 
you look around a ballpark today and youll see about 
halfandhalf men and women 
what do the players themselves think of baseball movies heres 
lou johnson 53 star of the los angeles dodgers in the 1960s and 
now doing community service lecturing against alcohol and drug 
abuse 
ive liked some of them like the lou gehrig story roy 
campanella tv movie and jackie robinson bingo long and the 
natural but youre not going to get an accurate picture of 
baseball out of movies theres got to be a lot of fantasizing 
they give you what the public wants not what is real 
i especially liked bingo long because it was about the negro 
american league and i could identify with it it captured the 
particular social life and lifestyle that we all went through he 
said

db sweeney approaches acting the way shoeless 
joe jackson played baseball just do it 
the best theory i ever heard about acting was from james 
cagney said sweeney 26 who plays jackson in john sayles 
eight men out the story of the 1919 chicago white sox scandal 
you walk in plant your feet stare the other fellow in the 
eyes and tell the truth all the acting theories ive heard all 
the books ive read you cant get it any simpler or purer than 
that 
eight men out tells the story of the biggest scandal in 
baseball the 1919 white sox were widely regarded as the best team 
of their time with such pitchers as ed cicotte and lefty williams 
and a lineup featuring future hall of famers eddie collins and ray 
schalk chicago won the american league pennant and were heavy 
favorites against the cincinnati reds in the world series 
no one however could play ball like jackson a lifetime 356 
hitter and outstanding left fielder once a mill worker in south 
carolina he had little education and could not read or write but 
was peerless on the field 
he was very passive sweeney noted he took the path of 
least resistance in everything he could everything he did was from 
a defensive mode except on the field where he attacks 
sweeney wanted to contrast jacksons athletic grace with his 
awkwardness in private life 
on the field i wanted him to be like ballet superstar 
mikhail baryshnikov i wanted every move he made to be 
beautiful sweeney said off the field i wanted him to be 
tentative 
players earned little money in jacksons era and were often 
tempted by gamblers to throw games eight members of the white sox 
including jackson agreed to or were aware of an effort to 
deliberately throw the series against cincinnati 
the reds won the series and the white sox poor play aroused 
widespread suspicion the following year commissioner kenesaw m 
landis permanently banned jackson and his seven teammates from 
baseball 
no one could ever prove that jackson who batted 375 in the 
world series ever tried to throw a game more likely he was 
punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it 
they dont kick you out of the pentagon for knowing about 
fraud sweeney said adding that jackson who died in 1951 
should have his name cleared and be inducted into the baseball hall 
of fame 
daniel bernard sweeney was born and raised in shoreham ny he 
attended tulane university and hoped to play major league baseball 
until tearing ligaments in his right knee 
the injury convinced sweeney to pursue a career in acting and 
he transferred to the performing arts division of new york 
university after graduating in 1984 he appeared in the broadway 
revival of the caine mutiny 
he made his film debut in sidney lumets power and has 
since appeared in francis ford coppolas gardens of stone and 
no mans land 
although sweeney has not appeared on stage in two years he 
still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater 
on no mans land there were about four producers one 
director to start the film and one to end it we had five different 
writers and by the way we also have these actors he said 
in a play even if its a neil simon play on broadway its 
going to have to be about the actors or nobodys going to come i 
enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with 
walkietalkies in your face 
sweeney felt an immediate rapport with sayles brother from 
another planet matewan and enjoyed working with him on the 
set 
we met in new york and talked for about an hour we talked 
about roberto clemente the late pittsburgh pirates star john 
likes the pirates hes a real bluecollar man those are the right 
reasons to like a baseball team he said 
i had access to john all the time we had a great 
relationship we would just check in with each other to gauge each 
others continued enthusiasm 
to prepare for the film sweeney traveled to kenosha wis and 
worked out with the local minor league team 
kenosha is a good town for jackson a real bluecollar town 
everybody there works for one of those corporations i think 
theres a similar ethic about work that jackson might have grown up 
with 
thats the world where jackson came from 
playing jackson boiled down to forgetting about everything 
except baseball 
i tried to stand there and clear my mind sweeney said he 
would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not 
hit it and hit it well in my daily life i have to deal with bank 
statements acting associates and friends and things its often 
like a juggling act

its so joe 
the baseball movie long relegated to hollywoods minor leagues 
is the winner of 1988s cinematic comeback of the year award from 
summer smash bull durham to critical rave eight men out 
baseball movies are back 
and so what if stealing home the mark harmonjodie foster 
entry in the baseball movie race was almost universally panned 
two out of three means hollywood is batting 667 this year 
the bounce back of baseball has prompted musings on the subject 
in the washington post the new york times and newsweek actor 
kevin costner delivered the most valuable performance in durham 
as veteran minor league catcher crash davis but an assortment of 
stars suited up this year mark harmon charlie sheen and db 
sweeney to name a few 
costner and sheen will do it again for movies coming out next 
year the switchhitting costner will appear in shoeless joe 
playing a farmer under the sway of black sox star joe jacksons 
ghost while sheen will be joined by la law star corbin 
bernsen in major league 
but why this return of the ballplayer as movie star after years 
without any horsehide hits 
the r rating gary cooper as lou gehrig who was married in 
pride of the yankees never enjoyed the offfield activities of 
durham bulls rookie righthander nuke laloosh and if susan sarandon 
had played mrs gehrig lou might have been the luckiest man on the 
face of the earth 
the popularity of baseball virtually everybody has played or 
watched the american pastime major league attendance increases 
every year in fact you can expect that announcement from 
outgoing commissioner peter ueberroth within weeks of the seasons 
finish this year 
the icandothat syndrome this factor is best described 
by national lampoon editor matty simmons any 5foot3 270pound 
slob can watch george bell blast a roger clemens 95mph fastball 
into northern quebec and say to himself i can do that why 
because baseball players look like human beings they look like 
they belong behind a 7eleven counter 
think about it cant you picture new york mets phenom gregg 
jefferies serving up a cold slurpee and a big gulp now try to 
imagine new york giants rookie jumbo elliot 6foot6 305 pounds 
doing the same thing 
as simmons points out elliot could be a 7eleven counter 
theres one more big reason the movies are better in the past 
most baseball movies focused on one player one star there was 
jimmy stewart as onelegged pitcher monty stratton and anthony 
psycho perkins as outfielder jimmy piersall or ronald reagan 
playing hurler grover cleveland alexander before his career really 
took off 
bull durham was the product of writerdirector ron shelton 
who spent five years kicking around the minor leagues in the 
baltimore orioles organization eight men out was done by john 
sayles a diehard baseball fan

military authorities allowed a 
chinese research ship to sail away today after they were convinced 
the vessel had simply sought shelter from a typhoon and was not 
smuggling guns to local communist rebels officials said 
the 3324ton science research vessel no 1 had steamed into 
northern luzon islands casiguran sound late monday and philippine 
constabulary troops seized it early the next day after a boarding 
party found guns and ammunition aboard 
the chinese embassy said the ship was seeking shelter from 
typhoon nelson which skirted northern luzon wednesday and the 
arms aboard were for protection of the ships 56 scientists and 45 
crew from pirates 
the arms included three machine guns eight assault rifles two 
semiautomatic rifles two hand guns and 4850 rounds of ammunition 
maj julius yarcia a constabulary intelligence officer 
inspected the vessel for a second time wednesday and told 
reporters today he found no signs the ship or the people aboard had 
violated any philippine law the ships scientists were reportedly 
aboard to conduct underwater research 
military officials are wary of ships with arms because of 
frequent reports of smuggling to communist rebels waging a 19year 
insurgency casiguran is in an area known for years as a rebel 
stronghold 
china maintains diplomatic relations with the philippines and 
has consistently denied giving the rebels any material aid

bonifacio santos whose mother never 
owned more than one pair of shoes at a time may be one of the 
countrys foremost experts on footwear his job he shines imelda 
marcos shoes 
santos says its a fulltime job to polish and buff the 2400 
pairs of shoes that imelda left behind when she and her husband 
ferdinand marcos fled to hawaii after the february 1986 uprising 
that toppled his administration 
for maintaining the thousands of dollars worth of shoes about 
half of which are on display at the malacanang palace museum 
santos earns 2300 pesos or 115 per month 
i know my salary is not enough to buy even one pair of 
imported shoes like these said santos 29 
soon after the marcos administration collapsed president 
corazon aquinos government announced that the former first lady 
had left behind 3000 pairs of shoes most of them imported 
eva toledo curator of the museum said later inventories 
reduced the figure to only 2400 pairs some of which were 
found in marcos residences throughout the philippines 
i was shocked when i first saw them said santos one of 16 
children when my mothers shoes wore a hole in the bottom shed 
get a new pair thats the way it is with most of us filipinos 
santos said he spends every friday brushing the dust from the 
shoes the rest of the week is devoted to polishing and buffing by 
the time he finishes polishing every pair its time to start all 
over again 
i clean the shoes with shoe polish he said i have to use 
so many colors to match the shoes weve had to wrap some of them 
in plastic now just to protect them 
the collection includes elegant high heels slippers with giant 
pompons and one pair with batteryoperated fiveinch heels that 
glow most are imported imeldas size 8 is hard to find in a 
country where the average woman wears a size 6 shoe 
santos says proudly that his own brown shoes are strictly 
locally made 
toledo said the government cannot get rid of the shoes until a 
court decides who owns them the shoes along with millions of 
dollars worth of property businesses and other possessions were 
seized by the government when marcos fled the country 
we will have to continue taking care of them she said 
toledo said the shoes must be continually polished to prevent 
deterioration because of high humidity and poor storage facilities 
about half the collection is stored in the basement of 
malacanang palace beneath imeldas former bedroom the palace is 
on the banks of the pasig river and water is seeping up from the 
basement floor 
toledo said that although the marcos family spent a fortune 
acquiring personal possessions they appear to have made little 
effort to provide for care and maintenance 
water oozes up through here and theres nothing we can do 
about it she said tapping her feet on the tiled basement floor 
santos said that despite his shock at the marcos excesses hes 
proud of his job which he considers a service to the filipino 
people 
and besides without a job id go hungry he added

the israeli armys use of 
plastic bullets to break up palestinian demonstrations is filling 
hospital wards with casualties and prompting calls for tighter 
controls 
victims of the new ammunition including two teenagers treated 
for plastic bullet wounds at ahli arab hospital in gaza city 
complain that stones thrown by protesters do not warrant the 
penalty 
its unreasonable punishment said mazul abu lail 19 a 
tailor who was shot in the ankle 
in a nearby bed 16yearold rifaat massoud a construction 
worker nodded in agreement 
it isnt right and it isnt fair for the soldiers to shoot 
innocent people massoud said shifting uncomfortably with a 
bullet wound in his left side 
the plastic bullet was introduced in august to supplement rubber 
bullets water cannons tear gas and clubs in dealing with the 
uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the other weapons proved 
to be insufficient to cope with stone throwing and that the army 
needed something less lethal than lead bullets 
the aim rabin said is to reduce antiisraeli violence in the 
territories with a minimum of fatalities since the uprising began 
dec 8 at least 280 palestinians have been killed and hundreds 
injured six israelis have died 
but rabin has acknowledged that the introduction of the plastic 
bullets may lead to more injuries 
in the past three weeks more than 325 palestinians have been 
wounded in clashes with israeli troops many by plastic bullets 
hospital officials and arab sources say 
the army says plastic bullets can penetrate the body but they 
are not supposed to be lethal if fired from at least 70 yards 
however at least four deaths from plastic bullets have been 
reported at shifa hospital in gaza city 
last week dr rustum namari director of the mukassad hospital 
in east jerusalem showed reporters fragments of a plastic bullet 
removed from the brain of a critically injured west bank youth 
namari said the bullet appeared to have been fired at close range 
if a plastic bullet enters the throat chest or abdomen it 
has the potential to cause death said a surgeon at shifa 
hospital who spoke on condition of anonymnity remember too 
that bullets respect no age he added victims he said have 
ranged in age from 7 to 90 
the bullets developed after israeli officials studied use of 
plastic ammunition in france are produced in israel 
similar plastic rounds have been used in northern ireland for 
riot control since 1970 and at least 13 deaths have been 
attributed to them there 
the united states britain and egypt have objected to the use of 
plastic ammunition against palestinian demonstrators and 
opposition has been mounting in israel 
a senior official of the un relief and works agency which 
provides humanitarian services to palestinian refugees filed a 
complaint with israeli military officials after casualties in gaza 
jumped from 19 in july to more than 130 in september 
last week the association for civil rights in israel filed a 
petition with israeli attorney general yosef harish urging him to 
issue legal guidelines on the use of the new bullets 
the group contended that opening fire for purposes of 
deterrence is an illegal act and called on harish to block use of 
the bullet for riot control 
until recently israeli soldiers were instructed to fire lead or 
plastic bullets only if their lives were in imminent danger in 
recent weeks however firing rules have been changed so troops may 
use the plastic rounds to break up demonstrations 
the army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron told a parliament 
committee tuesday that the army needed to stop riots before they 
get out of hand 
arabs who deliberately choose to go out and demonstrate are 
getting injured shomron was quoted as saying in jerusalem 
newspapers eventually they will realize that it is not in their 
interest to get involved in riots 
but he insisted strict orders had been issued against misusing 
the new weapon in addition to a firing range of 70 yards the 
bullets are to be aimed only at legs shomron said

china has set a course toward reconciliation with 
old adversaries talking summitry with the soviet union and india 
and making economic deals with south korea 
in what appear to be breakthroughs after years of talks china 
is sending foreign minister qian qichen to moscow and preparing for 
a visit by prime minister rajiv gandhi of india both events could 
occur before years end 
qian the first chinese foreign minister to make a working visit 
to the soviet union since chou enlai in 1956 is expected to lay 
the groundwork for the first chinesesoviet summit since nikita 
khrushchev visited beijing in 1959 
a summit would effectively normalize relations which have been 
difficult since nikita khrushchev and mao tsetung split in 1960 
over ideological differences and leadership of the communist world 
relations reached bottom with border fighting in 1969 
chinas diplomatic impasse with india is just as old heads of 
government met last when chou as premier visited new delhi in 
1960 and the last indian prime minister who traveled to beijing 
was jawaharlal nehru in 1954 
the two most populous nations in the world have been at odds 
because of indias prosoviet stance close chinese ties with 
pakistan and a border feud that led to fighting in 1962 
beijing also is forging new ties with another former enemy in 
war south korea direct and indirect trade could double to the 
equivalent of 3 billion this year and shandong province facing 
south korea across the yellow sea recently agreed to an exchange 
of trade offices with south korea 
south korean auto and electronics makers plan to invest in 
chinese plants and tourists from south korea are being welcomed to 
china formal diplomatic ties are unlikely soon however because 
china remains close to north korea its economically moribund ally 
in the korean war of 195053 
qian the foreign minister said in a recent interview that 
economic ties with south korea were only natural as china 
opened up its coastal areas 
the mood of detente also extends to japan a frequent object of 
chinese criticism despite its role as a major trading partner and 
chief source of financial aid 
japanese officials in beijing note a marked reduction over the 
past year in chinese warnings about a resurgence in japanese 
militarism or japans tendency to forget crimes it committed in 
world war ii both nations called the visit by prime minister 
noboru takeshita of japan in august the beginning of a new era 
in relations 
senior leader deng xiaoping has said since gaining power a 
decade ago that china needs peace on its borders to achieve 
economic development china began border talks with india in 1981 
and negotiations with moscow in 1982 
little progress has been made in either forum the possibility 
of gandhi and mikhail s gorbachev standing on the great wall owes 
more to the more relaxed state of the world 
ussoviet disarmament agreements moves to settle wars in 
afghanistan and the persian gulf and prospects for peace in 
angola cambodia and other areas appear to have given china more 
room to maneuver 
dialogue is taking the place of confrontation and the tendency 
to seek peaceful settlement of international disputes is growing 
qian said in a recent address to the un general assembly 
a western diplomat said the chinese may see the world as less 
dangerous to their interests if you dont have to use a lot of 
energy to protect yourself it gives you more flexibility 
younger leaders who have emerged in the past year are edging 
away from a foreign policy based mainly on the restating of 
formulas and principles 
one of them premier li peng noted recently that china and the 
soviet union share a 4300mile border and declared strain on 
relations between the two countries is not in the interest of china 
because we need to modernize our country in a peaceful 
environment

romance clodhopper shoes for men and lullaby 
tapes for yuppie babies will be hot in 1989 but it will be a 
hohum year for fashions and a bad year for fat kids according to 
the american forecaster 1989 
other 89 trends identified by the forecaster gutterless 
bowling alleys fighting dogs on steroids and turkey hunting 
new age religion channeling will become passe in 1989 along 
with teddy bears and soft cookies said kim long author of the 
sixth annual 192page forecaster which went on sale this week 
long said 1989 could be a boring year trendwise 
the problem he said is that baby boomers the onethird of 
the us population born between the years 1946 and 1964 are 
concentrating on their careers and families and college students 
have grown serious 
the rise of romance and a growing deemphasis on sex in 
advertising movies and television are directly linked to the aging 
baby boomers long said 
more of them are having their first kids and that tends to 
slow you down and keep you close to home he said 
long was surprised by the growing popularity of lullaby tapes 
for the babies of babyboomer moms baby boomer mothers who dont 
have time or dont know how to sing lullabies are buying tapes from 
the professionals he said 
clothing styles are becoming conservative and utilitarian long 
said there is nothing in mens or womens fashions that is a 
jump ahead pretty boring he said 
in mens footwear this means the return of big shoes 
expensive leather wingtips and brogues the big shoe thing has 
been building slowly and is part of the gradual return to 
traditional clothing long said 
long a denver freelance writer has been writing the american 
forecaster since 1983 his predictions have gained such 
respectability that the old farmers almanac gave long space in the 
1988 and 1989 editions 
long said the new age practice of channeling popularized by 
actress shirley maclain will fade in 1989 because of skepticism 
and ridicule 
but astrology will remain hot in 1989 long said mainly because 
of president and nancy reagans reliance on astrological 
interpretations and the subsequent efforts by astrologers to 
legitimize the practice as a science 
outofshape youngsters will be put in fitness programs as the 
preoccupation with health trickles down from adults to their 
offspring long predicted 
some curiosities among the trends that will take hold in 1989 
steroid use to make fighting dogs meaner and stronger gutterless 
bowling alleys and a surge in turkey hunting which long said was 
becoming popular because the birds are tough to shoot 
gutterless bowling alleys are for novices and the hopelessly 
uncoordinated long said inflatable tubes are placed in the 
gutters between the lanes 
long said in an interview last week that of his 1988 forecasts 
he is proudest of his prediction that girdle sales would increase 
and of his identification of biodegradable plastics as an important 
development 
on the down side he was off the mark in predicting the end of 
the tv shows dallas and dynasty and in saying that pee wee 
herman would go prime time 
long wrote in the 89 forecaster that michael dukakis will be 
the next president but last week he hedged according to every 
single indicator from the common to the bizarre its too close to 
call

foreign investors with a significant 
interest in american business or property would have to disclose 
their holdings to the government under legislation approved by the 
house 
give us the opportunity to have a basic inventory of ownership 
of the american economy rep john bryant dtexas the sponsor 
said as the house approved the measure 250170 on wednesday 
the measure now goes to the senate where its chances for 
approval are dim 
those owning more than 5 percent of a business or property 
valued at more than 5 million or that has more than 10 million in 
annual gross sales would have to report their identity and holdings 
to the commerce department 
the measure also would apply to investors holding more than 5 
percent of a combination of two or more businesses or properties 
valued at more than 20 million or with annual gross sales of more 
than 40 million 
foreigners with controlling interests in us businesses and 
properties would be required to submit more extensive reports 
including balance sheets and the identities of officers and 
directors 
the commerce department would establish a registry of foreign 
interests owning american property 
rep jim cooper dtenn described the measure as 
electionyear xenophobia designed to capitalize on fear of 
foreigners among voters 
supporters retorted that foreign takeover of us assets should 
not occur in secret 
the american people have the right to know who holds the 
mortgage on america rep marcy kaptur dohio declared 
the bill originally was included in the houses version of a 
wideranging trade measure signed by president reagan aug 23 but 
sponsors seeking to build support for the trade bill dropped the 
foreign ownership provision before it went to reagan 
the foreign ownership disclosure bill is now moving forward as 
separate legislation 
the measures prospects are dim in the senate where it would be 
vulnerable to a timeconsuming filibuster with only days remaining 
until lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time 
critics say the bill would bare business secrets that ought to 
be private thus scaring off foreigners whose investment helps to 
finance the budget deficit and fuels the economy creating jobs for 
americans 
the issue is confidentiality said rep norman lent rny 
this bill doesnt have adequate safeguards 
data on foreign ownership of american property already is 
collected by 17 federal agencies but the information is often kept 
secret even from congress and in any case the names of the actual 
owners rarely appear 
complaints persist that even those reports are often incomplete 
inaccurate and largely meaningless and that hundreds of billions of 
dollars in new investment have simply fallen through the cracks in 
recent years 
opponents also blasted the bill as discriminatory toward foreign 
investors because americans would not have to provide the same 
information

a new agriculture department analysis of this 
summers droughtinduced rise in wheat prices says consumers might 
feel some effect at grocery stores at least through 1989 
past movements suggest that the droughts influence on farm 
prices of wheat will be felt for about a year at the industrial 
wholesale level and for a year and a half or more by consumers 
the report said 
the study was done by ronald a babula of the departments 
economic research service and david a bessler texas aampm 
university and reported in the current issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine 
babula said wednesday in a telephone interview that he and 
bessler are not forcasting how food prices will behave in the 
coming months prices of various items could decline but still 
leave some impact from the 1988 drought 
were not predicting anything babula said were showing 
how things have moved in the past and some of the things that 
we might expect to see happen in the future 
a statistical computer model was used to show how prices of 
wheat at the farm wholesale prices and retail prices have moved 
together in the past 
the model was then shocked with an increase in the farm 
price of wheat to simulate the 77 percent average monthly boost 
during may june and july when the effects of the drought were 
first reflected in the market 
when the farm price shock occurs processor wholesale prices 
for wheat rise immediately peaking a month after the rise in the 
farm price the report said at their highest processor prices 
increase less than half of the 77 percent increase in the farm 
price processor price increases are felt for about a year but the 
impulse generally declines in strength through time 
on the other hand the 77 percent average increase in the farm 
price of wheat generates gradual not immediate increases in 
consumer prices of wheatrelated goods the report said 
delivery sale and consumption of flour bread cake mixes 
pasta and other wheatrelated foods occur throughout the year and 
are not as closely tied to the wheat crop cycle as processing 
which includes the flour milling and baking industries 
so the consumer price effects last more than a year the 
report said consumer price rises peak at seven months but 
prices stay relatively high until 17 to 20 months after the 
initiating farm price shock the increase in consumer prices is 
smaller but more enduring than the jump in processor prices

some promising new biological weapons are 
being used in the war against marauding grasshoppers says the 
agriculture department 
in one development two commercial firms evans biocontrol inc 
of broomfield colo and bozeman bio tech of bozeman mont have 
adapted usda technology for producing and storing a parasite 
nosema lucustae department studies show the parasite kills 50 
percent to 60 percent of grasshoppers in three to four weeks 
the basic tests and development were done by the departments 
agricultural research service at the agencys rangeland insect 
laboratory in bozeman by je henry and colleagues 
henry said the parasite is available to homeowners and ranchers 
through regional agents and on contract to government agencies 
which use it on a large scale in the west grasshoppers cause an 
estimated 400 million in damage to grass and crops each year he 
said 
spores of the parasite are put on wheat bran flakes to form a 
bait after the insects eat the bait the organism attacks the 
pests fat cells and depletes its energy stores henry said in a 
report issued here on wednesday 
the parasite remains in the grasshopper population because sick 
females pass it on to offspring and survivors eat dead relatives 
he said 
meanwhile another development involves an agreement with evans 
biotechnical to field test another natural killer grasshopper 
entomopoxvirus the agency said in laboratory tests the virus 
kills 20 percent to 30 percent of the grasshoppers right away and 
stunts the growth of an additional 20 percent to 30 percent 
doug a streett an entomoligist at the agencys bozeman 
laboratory said evans biocontrol plans to produce the virus and 
mix it with the parasite for tests on 1000 acres in the west 
streett said that in combination the two ingredients may work 
more rapidly to kill the grasshoppers

federal and state governments took legally 
required enforcement action for only 26 percent of more than 
100000 violations of the safe drinking water act in fiscal 1987 a 
conservation group said today 
it is the policy of the environmental protection agency to 
permit 23 months to lapse before even considering enforcement 
actions such as fines lawsuits or administrative orders the 
national wildlife federation said in releasing its findings 
the federation said the nations water systems or states 
notified customers of only 6 percent of the violations instead of 
every single one as the law requires 
the federation said it examined 15000 pages of epa records 
covering the 1987 fiscal year and found that 36763 public water 
systems committed 101588 violations of the act the affected water 
systems serve about 40 million people 
peter cook deputy director of epas office of drinking water 
said he was at a loss to explain how the federation arrived at its 
figures he said his office recorded about 2800 systems with 
significant violations in 1987 and 15500 systems with 
violations epa believed minor a decline from 4500 and 17000 
respectively the year before 
all regulatory agencies must have enforcement discretion 
cook said when epa finds a violation it is our position that it 
need not be an enforcement action that follows 
sixtyfour percent of water systems serve fewer than 500 people 
with 73 percent of significant violators and 83 percent of minor 
violators that small or smaller cook said 
small systems may have difficulty raising money for the best 
equipment he said it may take some time for this community to 
float a loan youre talking about years it doesnt make a lot 
of sense if you have a cooperative community which is moving 
ahead to beat them over the head with penalties that they cant 
afford anyway 
communities may be fined up to 25000 for each day of 
violation though fines that large are rare 
its important to understand that if enforcement actions are 
not taken the states are aggressive in protecting the public 
health through boil water notices to the public requirements 
for provision of bottled water and similar measures cook said 
he said the agency heartily recommends to the states fines 
and other actions against systems it considers recalcitrant 
there are about 201000 water systems serving the public of 
which 59000 are community systems serving more than 25 people 
and the rest noncommunity systems serving resorts campgrounds 
and other areas used only part of the year or by a transient 
population 
the federations report did not distinguish between excessive 
concentrations of a contaminant and failure to monitor or failure 
to report findings 
but norman dean a federation lawyer and principal author of the 
report said the records showed 13224 violations of enforceable 
contamination standards by community water systems and 4282 
violations by noncommunity systems 
this is not a situation where 99 percent of the violations are 
paper work violations dean said 
monitoring and reporting requirements are the heart of the 
law the study said they enable the identification and 
correction of public health risks before they blossom into crises 
one epa official told us that some public water systems stop 
monitoring when they become aware of a known health standard 
violation the report said 
the only detailed epa examination of a state program a review 
of floridas efforts completed in 1984 found a significant 
deficiency in reporting by state authorities of all violations to 
epa 
state agencies took only 2544 enforcement actions the 
federation said epa during the year completed only 50 
administrative orders had proposed 57 more and had issued 101 
notices of violation the first step before issuing an order or 
going to court 
epa told the federation recently it actually had completed 183 
or 184 such orders during the 1987 fiscal year but the federation 
said it was unable to verify the number or explain the discrepancy 
with the lower numbers found in its own examination of the records 
requirements that customers are to be notified are aimed at 
forcing water systems to toe the mark so they will not have to face 
public criticism but water systems issued only 5269 such notices 
and states only 598 in the year studied the report said 
the law permits states to run drinking water pollution 
prevention and enforcement programs as long as they are as strict 
as a federal program would be a state may opt out leaving epa 
with direct authority only indiana wyoming and the district of 
columbia have chosen to let epa enforce the federal law in their 
jurisdictions 
but in all states the law was changed in 1986 to require epa to 
act directly against local water systems if state authorities do 
not act within 30 days of learning of a violation

gen augusto pinochet is one of the few 
authoritarian leaders left in latin america where elected civilian 
government has returned to most countries 
the nearest geographically is gen alfredo stroessner who has 
ruled paraguay since seizing power in 1954 
president fidel castro has governed cuba since leading a 
successful revolution in 1959 and installing a communist regime 
in panama gen manuel antonio noriega qualifies as an 
authoritarian leader but is not technically the chief of state 
elected civilian governments have replaced military regimes in 
the last few years in argentina brazil uruguay peru ecuador and 
bolivia 
military governments ruled brazil for two decades until 1985 
five generals took turns as president chosen by their peers and 
sharing power with them 
argentinas armed forces ousted civilian president isabel peron 
in march 1976 and retained power until 1983 leaving in disgrace 
after defeat in the falkland islands war with britain 
governing was an act of the military institution in both 
countries but the regimes of pinochet 72 and stroessner 75 are 
personal 
pinochet declared a few years ago not a single leaf moves in 
this country unless i move it and stroessner probably could say 
the same

augusto pinochet has been tireless in 
what he sees as a mission from god to reconstruct a new 
communistproof society 
shrewd and combative pinochet successfully resisted the 
regional trend toward elected civilian rule that prevailed in many 
latin american countries in the 1980s his rightwing authoritarian 
regime he says is a bulwark against marxism 
pinochet took power in 1973 in a coup that toppled the elected 
government of marxist president salvador allende the takeover won 
wide support because it occurred at a time of social unrest and 
economic chaos few however could have predicted pinochet would 
remain in power this long 
but pinochet immediately banned all political activity and 
purged the nation of tens of thousands of leftists most were 
expelled although hundreds were imprisoned and scores were 
tortured and executed according to human rights groups 
pinochet also outmaneuvered the commanders of the navy air 
force and national police who were initially supposed to alternate 
with him as the countrys ruler using his muscle as army 
commander the most powerful of chiles military branches he 
emerged as the sole leader 
born nov 25 1915 in the port city of valparaiso pinochet was 
one of three children of a customs official ignoring parental 
pleas to study medicne he entered the military academy after 
twice being rejected as too young and physically weak 
in the army he filled out to 185 pounds and earned a university 
degree now he boasts a boxers physique and is said to lifts 
weight daily he is reported to drink little 
according to a 1980 autobiography he noted an international 
marxist threat while commanding a camp for communist prisoners in 
1948 and lectured on the dangers of communism while teaching at the 
national war college 
however when allende became president pinochet remained 
outwardly loyal and was named army commander a month before the 
coup some participants in the takeover said he joined the 
conspiracy opportunistically at the last minute 
the political repression that followed the coup earned pinochet 
an image as a brutish dictator repression included the 
assasination of critics in exile including orlando letelier 
killed in a washington car bombing in 1976 pinochet has denounced 
foreign criticism as interferring in chiles internal affairs 
he announced plans to reshape chilean society and construct 
safeguards against communism a constitution approved in a 1980 
referendum bans all ideologies based on class struggle it also 
included a phased return to democracy and called for the 
presidential plebiscite that occurred wednesday 
he launched a freemarket economic program that coupled with 
heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued currency produced a 
financial nearcollapse in the early 1980s massive antigovernment 
protests threatened to topple his government but he moderated his 
policies winning even the begrudged praise of his opponents with 
five years of steady economic growth and stability 
pinochet preaches patriotism family values and hard work his 
stern demeanor appeals to many common chileans but his behavior 
bothers most educated citizens 
he often appears in public with his wife lucia they have three 
daughters and two sons 
in recent years especially since a september 1986 assasination 
attempt by leftist guerrillas pinochet has come to cite god in 
1987 he declared god put me on the top 
now obsessed with personal security his motorcade routinely 
includes four cars of heavily armed bodyguards a van carry an army 
commando unit an ambulance and an army helicopter gunship

the nations airlines did a pretty good job of 
delivering their passengers on time this past summer with more 
than four of every five flights arriving near schedule government 
figures show 
the transportation department said wednesday that in august the 
13 leading airlines had an ontime record of 83 percent the second 
best since monthly reports have been available the only better 
month was june which had an 843 percent ontime record the 
government said 
from april through august the airlines reported better than 80 
percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule 
considered on time by the government each month 
the summer months normally have delay problems because of the 
heavy vacation travel as well as frequent thundershowers and other 
weather problems according to industry experts 
two years ago the summer travel months brought record flight 
delays and loud complaints the federal aviation administration 
reported more than 1000 delays a day because of air traffic 
control problems alone in the summer of 1986 that was an increase 
of 25 percent over the previous years no statistics on total 
number of delays were available at that time 
the delay problem eased a bit in the summer of 1987 but 
congressional pressure and loud protests from air travelers 
prompted the department to order the airlines to provide monthly 
ontime performance reports beginning in september 1987 
during the first year of the reporting requirement the air 
carriers averaged a 78 percent ontime record the department said 
wednesday 
air traveler complaints to the departments consumer affairs 
office have declined sharply according to the figures provided 
wednesday 
during september the last month available the department 
received 1897 such complaints 20 percent fewer than in august and 
66 percent fewer than in september 1987 when the department 
received 5618 complaints from air travelers 
the ontime statistics cover the 13 leading airlines and do not 
include delays attributed to mechanical problems although they do 
include delays caused by poor weather 
in august according to the department delta air lines had the 
best ontime record among the largest air carriers with 869 
percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule 
followed by continental airlines 868 and american airlines 
859 
the overall best ontime record was given to two smaller sun 
belt carriers america west 915 percent and southwest airlines 
905 percent 
pan american world airways and usair reported the worst ontime 
records with one of every four flights arriving late the 
department said 
the salt lake city utah airport had the best arrival record in 
august with 914 percent of the flights landing within 15 minutes 
of schedule the pittsburgh airport where repairs on a runway have 
contributed to delays had the worst record with 713 percent of 
the flights landing on time 
hawaiian airlines had the worst complaint record with 1257 
complaints for every 100000 passengers flown in september 
followed by pan american world airways with 1145 
meanwhile in august the number of mishandled bags was down 
slightly averaging 703 for every 1000 passengers compared with 
715 in july 
twa had the highest number of mishandled baggage reports with 
1077 for every 1000 passengers followed by piedmont airlines at 
893 per 1000 passengers

congress is putting the finishing touches on a 
campaign to reduce indoor exposure to radon the naturally 
occurring gas that health officials say is second only to smoking 
as a cause of lung cancer deaths 
pending in the senate is housepassed legislation that would 
require inspections of public schools for dangerous levels of radon 
and set a longterm national goal of having indoor air as free of 
the gas as the air outdoors 
rep james florio dnj said he expects the bill to easily 
clear the senate in the closing days of the 1988 session and go to 
the white house where it already has been endorsed by the reagan 
administration 
the broadly supported legislation which won voicevote approval 
in the house on wednesday is moving toward the statute books in 
the wake of a recent warning by the us public health service and 
the environmental protection agency 
the agencies advised people to have their residences tested for 
radon an odorless colorless gas produced by the decay of uranium 
deposits found in the ground in many parts of the nation 
epa and usphs estimated that nationally one of every 10 houses 
could have dangerous levels of radon they said they believe such 
levels are present in about 25 percent of the homes in 17 states 
where radon deposits are prevalent 
authorities have estimated that indoor concentrations of radon 
are responsible for as many as 20000 lung cancer deaths annually 
the housepassed bill would require epa to conduct a national 
survey of school buildings and advise local education agencies 
about ways of reducing high concentrations of radon 
it would authorize 30 million over the next three years for a 
matching grant program to help states set up their own radon 
control programs less than half the states now have such programs 
epa would be required to set up training programs to teach state 
and local officials proper techniques for radon monitoring 
assessment and mitigation it also would have to set standards for 
certifying radon measuring devices and rating the effectiveness of 
radoncontrol contractors 
rep thomas luken dohio the bills floor manager in the 
house said these provisions are needed to protect homeowners from 
unscrupulous contractors and profiteers 
new radon testing and mitigation companies spring up 
overnight and unfortunately not all of them are qualified or 
scrupulous he said 
contractors have charged as much as 4000 when they could 
have charged 1000 and still profited nicely luken said even 
worse salespeople have tried to palm off fly paper and vacuum 
cleaners as testing and mitigation devices 
the bill also would create a process under which state and local 
building codes would eventually be revised to require the use of 
construction techniques that would minimize the entry of radon into 
structures 
epa has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as the level 
at which homeowners should take steps to make their houses more 
resistant to radon seepage from the ground 
house sponsors of the bill say it is uncertain whether this 
level is fully protective of human health during longterm exposure 
to indoor radon they said this is why they want to set a national 
goal of minimizing exposure to radon

president reagan issued a challenge to 
antisemitism at home and abroad as he dedicated a holocaust museum 
in the face of protesters who called the memorial unamerican and 
antichristian 
in a speech at a cornerstone ceremony near the washington 
monument reagan on wednesday said the holocaust memorial museum 
scheduled for completion on the site in 1992 will examine the 
nature and meaning of the continuing curse that is antisemitism 
i think all of us here are aware of those even among our own 
countrymen who have dedicated themselves to the disgusting task of 
minimizing or even denying the truth of the holocaust he said 
this act of intellectual genocide must not go unchallenged 
reagan referred to groups that dispute the generally accepted 
account of the murder of about 6 million jews and other persecuted 
people in nazi death camps during world war ii 
and yet just as we must challenge it here at home so too we 
must challenge antisemitism abroad the president said accusing 
the united nations of intellectual infamy and the soviet union 
of the subtler forms of antisemitism 
we know that the united nations whose peackeepers were 
honored only last week for their service to the world has yet to 
repeal its infamous resolution equating zionism and racism he 
told his audience we know where such intellectual infamy can 
lead the world has learned that when the truth is turned on its 
head holocausts become possible 
and there are subtler forms of antisemitism reagan added 
there are still tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of 
thousands of soviet jews who wait to leave the soviet union so 
that they may live free as jews and here as we lay this 
cornerstone and vow that the jewish people will never stand alone 
against tyranny i want to ask the soviet leaders a question where 
are those exit visas 
this and other remarks of the president were greeted with warm 
applause by the invited audience of about 1500 the president 
assisted by harvey m meyerhoff of baltimore chairman of the us 
holocaust memorial commission pulled a gold cord to reveal the 
chunk of pink north carolina granite that will stand at the corner 
of the museum 
as the presidents motorcade approached the site however it 
passed a scattering of pickets carrying signs one read stop 
unamerican holocaust museum on our historic mall 
another attacked the museum as antiamerican antichristian

white house officials insist they are 
continuing to look into prospects for renewing military aid to the 
nicaraguan contras despite warnings from capitol hill that the 
administration doesnt have the votes needed to free 165 million 
in stockpiled weapons for the rebels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters wednesday 
that its all under consideration and we havent made a formal 
decision 
a senior administration official who spoke on condition he not 
be identified supported fitzwaters comments saying the 
administration wanted to make clear we are not abandoning the 
contras 
the official acknowledged that hopes were dim for getting the 
stockpiled weapons to the rebels this congressional term 
but he also indicated that reagan aides were looking toward the 
possibility of renewing military aid under the next administration 
particularly if vice president george bush is elected 
if the white house were to seek release of the weapons it would 
have to move quickly lawmakers eager to return home to campaign 
this election year are expected to wrap up work on capitol hill 
next week 
there is some feeling now that a request couldnt be passed 
weve had congressional leaders tell us the votes arent 
there the official said 
but he added that the issue for the administration is a 
question of timing right now were running out of time and it may 
be better to wait until the next administration 
fitzwater noted that a provision in a defense appropriations 
bill reagan signed last weekend permits the president to request a 
congressional vote on whether to release the 165 million weapons 
stockpile now stored in honduras to the rebels 
congress rejected an administration military aid request last 
feb 3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the contras 
occurred on feb 29 
delivery of the equipment was halted because of the central 
american peace process and the ceasefire between the contras and 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
the spokesman also pointed out that under the legislation 
reagan must meet certain criteria in order to request the 
congressional vote 
besides certifying that nicaragua has sparked a crisis in 
central america the administration must consult with the four 
central american democracies 
fitzwater said the presidents justification for the release of 
the aid also must meet two out of three conditions cited in the 
legislation 
of the three he said the administration believes two had been 
met continuing unacceptable levels of soviet aid and sandinista 
violations of the peace accords 
the spokesman called the third condition that the sandinistas 
have initiated an allout attack against the contras an 
open question

acid rain has polluted more than half 
of europes lakes and rivers and the contamination has spread much 
farther than earlier believed an international report said 
the report which was released wednesday said nearly all small 
bodies of water in central europe are so badly contaminated that 
they can no longer be used for drinking water it also said the 
actual damage could be much worse because the research was based 
mainly on information provided by the countries involved 
in some cases it is too late to do anything said kaarle 
kenttamies head of the finnish environment ministry team which 
conducted the survey for the unsponsored convention on 
longrange transboundary air pollution 
in other countries particularly the peripheral regions such 
as scandinavia and southernmost europe there is still hope he 
told the associated press 
but many small lakes and rivers especially in central europe 
are dead and only a 100 percent drop in sulfur emissions can save 
them he said he also said dumping heavy doses of lime could 
also help reduce acidity 
the yearlong research project showed nearly all smaller bodies 
of water in central europe can no longer be used as sources of 
drinking water kenttamies said 
acid rain carries a high concentration of acids produced by 
sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and other chemicals emitted during 
the burning of fossil fuels the unsponsored conference which 
drew participants from the united states the soviet union and nine 
west european nations urged the economic commission for europe to 
adopt stricter measures to fight pollution caused by nitrogen and 
sulfur emissions 
the commissions member countries have decided to start a joint 
international pollution monitoring project in 1989 to study 
environmental changes caused by acid rain 
despite certain opposition to such research particularly in 
the united states and great britain we can can safely say that 
acidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the 
1980s kenttamies said 
president reagan has been criticized by environmentalists for 
failing to do more to solve the problem of acid rain during his two 
terms in office in august however he gave the goahead for 
continuing negotiations toward us participation in an 
international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid 
rain 
 
kenttamies rejected as nonsense the argument that no 
conclusive evidence exists that fossil fuelfired power stations 
contribute heavily to acid rain 
whatever people say ive seen enough reports and been to 
enough conventions like the one here today to know that we have 
such conclusive evidence he said 
the high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countries 
which rely heavily on fossil fuels britain and poland both heavy 
coal users are the only european nations which refused to join in 
a project to reduce sulfur emissions by 30 percent of 1980 levels 
by 1993 
acid rain in scandinavia mostly from industrial centers in 
eastern and western europe also has contaminated lakes and forests 
finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in what 
had been considered virgin lapland in northern finland caused by 
huge soviet copper and nickel works in the kola peninsula

price gouging at the nations supermarkets a 
concern raised by lawmakers as drought crept over us croplands 
has not materialized despite some unexplained cost increases 
congressional investigators say 
the bottom line is that there has been restraint patrick j 
leahy dvt said wednesday at a senate agriculture committee 
hearing on food prices in the wake of the summer drought 
at the hearing the general accounting office unveiled a report 
showing retail pasta prices rose 104 percent cereal 71 percent 
and white bread 82 percent from january through june 
fortythree percent of the pasta and cereal increases as well 
as 57 percent of the rise for white bread came before june when 
the drought emerged as a serious problem for us agriculture 
according to the report 
but pasta cereal and white bread prices rose more between june 
and august than they did in the same period last year the report 
said 
some of the worst damage from blazing sun and scarcity of rain 
came in the northern plains where durum wheat used in the making 
of pasta is produced 
farm prices for durum as well as hard red spring wheat a 
primary ingredient in white bread increased this year in 
comparison with 1987 but that alone would not be enough to explain 
the price rise 
livestock feed also came into short supply as a result of 
searing heat prompting producers to step up cattle sales and 
driving down prices consumers however enjoyed no cost savings 
gao officials told the panel 
they said there was no clear explanation of just why prices of 
wheatbased products exceeded levels explainable by the drought 
alone 
prices of packing of food products went up significantly this 
year mary kenney of the gao told the committee she suggested 
that might furnish at least part of the explanation 
there could have been some labor cost increases we dont 
know if there were said john w harman associate director of 
the gaos resources community and economic development division 
the one group that should not be blamed for food price increases 
is the farmers said steven d maurer director of the ohio 
department of agriculture 
the farmers share of the good market dollar has remained 
relatively constant he said 
the price of farm commodities on average accounted for 30 
percent of the price of food at the supermarket last year the rest 
went to transportation packaging advertising and other marketing 
costs 
sen kent conrad dnd also said farmers should not be 
blamed in addition he rejected the notion that price increases 
before june could not have been related to the drought 
he said he had expected a hot dry summer and the food 
industry might have done the same in view of its excellent 
sources of intelligence 
conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found 
sen tom harkin diowa told the panel but there are 
indications out there that it could develop next year 
my advice to consumers is to engage in comparative shopping 
he said

the reagan administration sees no need to 
change the formula for calculating costofliving increases for 
social security and other entitlements despite claims that millions 
of beneficiaries are being shortchanged 
white house budget director james c miller iii on wednesday 
said it would make no difference in what the government spends 
on those increases if one labor department consumer price index 
were subsituted for another in figuring the increases 
but in a written statement to the senate special committee on 
aging miller said i do not believe any changes are needed at 
the present time 
the panels chairman sen john melcher dmont has introduced 
two bills that would immediately substitute one inflation survey 
for the other in calculating benefit increases and spend 15 
million to develop a new survey devoted only to price changes 
experienced by the elderly 
with figures due out in two weeks on how big an increase 38 
million social security recipients can expect in their checks next 
year the committee held hearings on melchers proposals wednesday 
miller cited a congressional budget office study showing that 
families headed by people 65 or over have experienced the largest 
real income gains of any age group between 1970 and 1986 
social security beneficiaries have in fact been well protected 
from inflation over the last decade and a half under the exisiting 
costofliving provisions he said poverty rates among the 
elderly have been cut in half over this period 
since 1978 the government has used annualized thirdquarter 
changes in the labor departments consumer price index for urban 
wage earners and clerical workers cpiw to calculate the annual 
benefit increases 
last year for example annualized inflation as measured by that 
index for that quarter was 42 percent yielding social security 
recipients an average 21 a month increase in their benefit checks 
melcher and advocacy groups for the elderly want the government 
to switch to a more widely used price index for urban households 
cpiu immediately while developing an entirely new cpie for the 
elderly for eventual use in calculating the benefit changes 
at wednesdays hearing melcher said the cpiw understates the 
increases that the elderly actually are experiencing because it 
does not take into account the higher percentages of their income 
spent on medical care and housing 
annual differences in the cpiu and cpiw indexes have ranged 
from 01 percent to 05 percent over the past five years but 
cumulated inflation as measured by the wage earners survey totaled 
165 percent over the five years compared with 182 percent as 
measured by the more widely accepted urban household survey 
this means that millions of retirees who depend on benefits or 
pensions from these programs may not be getting a square deal 
melcher said if all the costs of the elderly were figured in 
annual colas would be higher as much as 5 a month for some 
people 5 isnt very much money but for many elderly 5 is a lot 
of money 
at melchers instigation the labor department earlier this year 
constructed an experimental index measuring only the inflation 
experienced by consumers age 62 and over 
reflecting that the elderly spend nearly 9 percent of their 
income on medical costs compared with roughly 5 percent spent by 
urban households in general it showed inflation over the past five 
years totaling 195 percent for those 62 and over 
had the experimental index been in use the average social 
security retiree would have received a total of 528 in additional 
benefits over the past five years said mary jane yarrington a 
policy analyst for an advocacy group the national committee to 
preserve social security and medicare 
however labor statistics commissioner janet l norwood said the 
experimental survey had larger sampling errors than the official 
measures

the chairman of a senate narcotics panel says 
foreign banks must be forced to keep records of large cash 
transactions to help block laundering of us drug profits 
cash us dollars are the stock and trade of narcotics 
traffickers and currently there is a gigantic loophole sen john 
f kerry dmass said wednesday 
kerry chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
narcotics and terrorism said an estimated 30 billion to 100 
billion in drugtied us cash is laundered each year 
he and mitch mcconnell rky the panels ranking republican 
said that when the senate begins debate on sweeping drug 
legislation they would push an amendment designed to create a paper 
trail for prosecutors debate on the drug legislation is expected 
to start before the end of next week when congress adjourns for 
campaigning 
major drug traffickers now take us drug profits by plane or 
boat to nations in the caribbean or central america and deposit 
huge chunks of cash in banks there often under phony corporation 
names kerry said the dealers then have the banks wire the money 
to the institutions us branches 
in that way drug traffickers can launder their illegal profits 
and avoid federal regulations that require banks in the united 
states to maintain strict records of cash transactions of 10000 
or more 
the kerrymcconnell proposal would extend that requirement to 
foreign banks with us branches as well as to american banks with 
overseas offices 
kerry said he expected strong opposition from large banks 
this bill will destabilize drug dealers criminal networks by 
denying them free access to the american banking system 
mcconnell said it will give law enforcement officials the tools 
necessary to trace and seize drug assets and prosecute those 
criminals right out of business 
the kerrymcconnell amendment would require the treasury 
department to negotiate within two years agreements with nations 
that have been identified as key moneylaundering centers 
under the legislation all offshore banks with us ties would 
be required to maintain records of cash transactions of 10000 or 
more obtain from those depositors a waiver of privacy rights if 
the records are needed in a drugrelated investigation and obtain 
from depositors personal identification and documents stating the 
source of the money 
with enactment of this amendment international drug dealers 
will have to find a black market dry cleaner for their us dollars 
because all the legitimate laundromats will be closed to them 
kerry told a news conference

a new house bill designed to combat the 
greenhouse effect or global warming trend would require a 
wide range of energysaving measures including a higher gas 
guzzler tax and rebates for buyers of fuelefficient autos 
republican and democratic lawmakers said wednesday in 
introducing the legislation that they did not expect action on the 
bill before congress adjourns next week 
the reagan administration has said more study is needed before 
taking action to curb the greenhouse effect 
rep claudine schneider rri chief architect of the new 
proposal said available options for reducing greenhouse gases such 
as carbon dioxide can vary in cost by tenfold or more 
this makes it imperative that the strategy the federal 
government undertakes in formulating global warming prevention 
policies avoids imposing needless and wasteful expenditures 
she said 
the global warming trend which some scientists say already has 
begun could raise the average temperature of the earth by 3 
degrees to 8 degrees in the middle of the next century 
the warming comes about because gases arising from human 
activity build up in the atmosphere trapping radiant heat that 
normally would escape to space the most important gas carbon 
dioxide comes from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and 
coal 
also on wednesday a report from the environmental and energy 
study institute a companion organization to the congressional 
environmental and energy study conference called for a first 
priority on energy efficiency by the next administration 
the report said political leaders must be willing to raise the 
consumer cost of using fuels that produce carbon dioxide a 
prominent example would be gasoline 
ms schneiders measure calls for substantial increases in funds 
for research and development modification of federal buildings to 
create 40 percent energy savings by the end of the century tough 
efficiency standards for electric lights and major increases in 
auto fuel efficiency along with a higher gasguzzler tax and 
rebates for buyers of efficient models

us officials say moscow has made a key 
concession in talks defining the agenda for a new round of 
eastwest negotiations to cut nonnuclear weapons in europe 
two state department officials speaking on condition they not 
be identified said wednesday the soviets had given up their demand 
that airdefense aircraft be excluded from the negotiations 
expected to start by next year 
the negotiations would be between the 16nation north atlantic 
treaty organization and the sevenmember warsaw pact the first 
such bloctobloc arms talks 
in another gesture an official told the associated press the 
soviets indicated they were prepared to do more on human 
rights possibly releasing additional political prisoners 
about 300 have been set free in the 3 years since mikhail s 
gorbachev now the soviet president rose to power the united 
states is insisting on more movement before convening the eastwest 
negotiations on troop and armament reductions 
president reagan and secretary of state george p shultz have 
expressed optimism that the arms control talks which would cover 
the vast expanse of europe from the atlantic to the ural mountains 
of the soviet union will open by the end of the year 
narrower eastwest negotiations dealing with central europe have 
made little headway over the past 14 years they would be replaced 
by the new broader talks 
the soviets made their demand for a special exemption for 
airdefense aircraft in august the official said but now they 
have thought better of it and sent signals the demand would 
be withdrawn the official said 
the change in soviet attitude was registered in talks soviet and 
western leaders are holding in new york while attending the special 
session of the un general assembly 
it does not mean that nato will be able to persuade the soviets 
to limit their aircraft the official said but we want to be 
free to raise the issue during negotiations 
naval forces chemical weapons and nuclear arms will be excluded 
a problem that has not been resolved is whether all of turkey 
and the soviet caucasus region should be included 
the western allies are trying to prevent cuts in turkish forces 
near iraq and iran while the soviets say they would have to be 
compensated by excluding forces in the caucasus 
the two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets stance on human rights remains the main issue to be 
resolved before eastwest talks could begin

ten teenage hackers may have run up 650000 
in telephone calls by tricking phone company computers and their 
parents could be liable for the tab authorities said 
they reached out all right assistant us attorney russell 
mayer said of the nine 14yearold and one 17yearold hackers 
they reached out and touched the world 
tom spurlock resident agentincharge of the las vegas secret 
service office said the teenagers engaged in blue boxing a 
technique that enabled them to talk to fellow hackers throughout 
europe 
its very popular very accessible its definitely going on 
other places as well spurlock said wednesday 
they were calling numbers that were in the atampt system and 
their computer programs would allow them to jump atampts 
circuits allowing them to call anywhere in the world 
the expensive shenanigans came to light when local phone company 
officials discovered unusual activity on nine las vegas phone 
lines spurlock said he said federal agents obtained warrants and 
searched the nine homes 
the teenagers were not taken into custody or charged but their 
computers were seized 
they were pretty shook up when we visited them spurlock 
said 
spurlock said the parents who could be held liable for the 
expensive phone conversations were unaware of what was happening 
one of the parents told us i thought he was being a good boy 
because he was always working with his computer and talking to his 
friends on the phone spurlock said 
he said the number of calls and the destinations were still 
being tabulated but the 650000 in calls was a good estimate 
spurlock said the teenagers had been using the system 13 months 
and that each had amassed monthly bills of 5000 
spurlock said it will be up to atampt to decide whether to seek 
reimbursement once a final tally is obtained 
mayer said the case probably would be left to local authorities 
to decide whether to prosecute

a vaccine that makes the body attack sperm was 
100 percent effective in tests with female and male guinea pigs 
the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a 
vaccine scientists reported today 
the study which also found the effects of the vaccination 
temporary raises the prospect that a similar vaccine might work in 
women and men 
but there are many things about it that would have to be 
changed or improved to make it a useful method for either 
agricultural animals or humans said researcher paul primakoff 
the vaccine is designed to prevent fertilization which may make 
it more widely acceptable than another vaccine already in human 
testing that stops development of the embryo other scientists said 
primakoff and colleagues at the university of connecticut health 
center in farmington conn reported the experiment in the british 
journal nature 
none of the 25 female guinea pigs that were vaccinated before 
mating had litters nor did the mates of the six immunized male 
guinea pigs animals that received sham immunizations for 
comparison purposes remained fertile 
eleven of 24 females tested had regained fertility by nine to 11 
months after the immunization and all four of the longeststudied 
group had delivered litters by 15 months among males four of six 
had regained fertility by seven months after the immunization 
in a telephone interview primakoff said his team has since 
produced contraception in 17 other male guinea pigs 
the vaccine is designed to make the bodys diseasefighting 
immune system attack a protein found in guinea pig sperm the 
details of just how that blocks fertility in guinea pigs are not 
known primakoff said 
but immune system proteins called antibodies taken from the 
immunized females prevented sperm from binding normally to guinea 
pig eggs in the test tube that suggests the vaccine blocks 
fertilization within vaccinated females primakoff said 
in males the vaccination triggered an invasion of the testicle 
by immune system cells that is not something you would want 
going on in your body because of the potential for longterm 
harm primakoff said 
so to produce a human male vaccine researchers would have to 
find a way to trigger just the antibodies without the rest of an 
immune system reaction he said 
no evidence indicates the guinea pig vaccine would work in 
humans nor is there any assurance that human sperm contains a 
suitable protein target for a similar vaccine he said 
richard bronson director of the reproductive endocrinology 
division at the state university of new york at stony brook called 
the research very encouraging 
it suggests research into a spermtargeting vaccine is heading 
in the right direction he said 
the 100 percent contraception rate makes the results really 
terrific said nancy alexander director of applied fundamental 
research for the contraceptive research and development program at 
the jones institute of reproductive medicine in norfolk va 
a vaccine that prevents fertilization might avoid religious and 
cultural implications of another kind of vaccine that has already 
begun preliminary human testing she said 
that vaccine blocks the action of a hormone called human 
chorionic gonadotropin scientists are unsure whether the blocking 
prevents the blastocyst a clump of cells that grows from a 
fertilized egg from implanting itself in the uterus wall or 
whether it prevents further development soon after implantion 
implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the 
egg is fertilized 
researchers overseas have shown the hormoneblocking vaccine is 
safe in humans and are preparing to start testing its 
effectiveness alexander said

security at the athens airport 
was virtually nonexistent when a twa airliner was boarded by 
terrorists in 1985 and hijacked to beirut a passenger testified 
during the trial of mohammed ali hamadi 
australian william henderson 56 told the court wednesday that 
he was traveling with his family and was amazed at the lax security 
just prior to the the athenstorome flight 
there was no security there at all i walked out to look at 
the tarmac and came back in no one stopped me said henderson 
henderson said electronic security devices did not detect a 
knife he carried i had a small pocket knife in my pocket which 
i always carry it did not set any security check off 
i wondered why it didnt because it always had before at 
other airports the retired school principal said 
the court has been trying to determine how weapons including a 
chromeplated pistol and hand grenades were smuggled onto the june 
14 1985 flight hamadi has refused to say how the weapons were 
taken on board 
greek officials repeatedly have asserted that security measures 
at the airport were adequate before the hijacking ordeal during 
which us navy diver robert stethem was shot to death 
hendersons wife rosemarie 52 told the court wednesday that 
stethem had talked with her daughter after the hijackers had beaten 
him 
mrs henderson said that before he was shot stethem told her 
daughter ruth that he hoped the hijackers would pick him and not 
his five married navy colleagues on board if they were going to 
kill someone stethem 23 of waldorf md was single 
he said to her that if anyone would have to be killed he 
hoped it would be him because the others five fellow divers were 
all married mrs henderson said her voice breaking with emotion 
mrs henderson said her 19yearold daughter would not be able 
to testify before the three judges and five jurors until november 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger had hoped to end the trial by 
the end of year but said wednesday it would likely extend into next 
year because of problems scheduling some witness testimony the 
trial was recessed wednesday until oct 11 
the court did not ask mrs henderson where the family lived in 
australia or which school her daughter attended in keeping with 
its policy on protecting witness security 
waving her hands occasionally mrs henderson also told of how 
hamadi and twa flight attendant uli derickson led stethem down the 
airplanes aisle after he had been beaten 
the young man stethem was crying he was unable to walk by 
himself said mrs henderson 
stethem was shot and killed by one of the hijackers when the 
plane landed in beirut a second time after returning there from 
algiers 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem has confessed to being one of 
the two gunman who hijacked the airplane but has denied firing the 
shot that killed stethem 
hamadi is being tried in a heavily guarded courtroom inside 
frankfurts preungesheim prison several dozen police armed with 
machine guns and other weapons patrol the area during court 
sessions 
in addition to killing stethem the hijackers held 39 americans 
captive for 17 days 
when hamadi and stethem arrived at their seats mrs henderson 
said the defendant pointed the gun at my husband and said out 
and they placed him in another seat they placed the young man next 
to me 
he was in shock he also had a bandage around his neck it had 
blood on it mrs henderson said 
mrs henderson said that she later switched seats with her 
daughter and that her daughter talked to the injured sailor at 
length

lloyd bentsen shrugged off his differences 
with michael dukakis over supporting nicaraguas contra rebels and 
said the important point was they both support efforts to bring 
peace to central america while the reagan administration offers 
only a military answer 
republican dan quayle meeting democrat bentsen in a debate in 
omaha neb between the two vice presidential candidates said 
dukakis policy toward central america was out of step with 
mainstream united states voters 
asked about his longterm support for the nicaraguan contras 
despite dukakis opposition to the aid bentsen said governor 
dukakis and i have disagreed on the contra program no question 
about that 
but he said he opposed the reagan administrations central 
american policy because they look at the contra aid program as 
the only way to resolve that problem 
i really think we have to give peace a chance bentsen said 
and thats why i have been a strong supporter of the arias plan 
a plan that won the nobel prize for president oscar arias the 
president of costa rica 
he said the united states had to work with leaders of central 
american countries to try to bring about the democratization of 
nicaragua by negotiation by pressure by counseling by diplomatic 
pressure that we ought to be trying that first 
the reagan administration has paid too little attention to the 
rest of central america bentsen said 
said quayle theres no doubt in a dukakis administration 
that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in 
nicaragua and that is unfortunate 
he said dukakis seemed to think it was all right for the soviet 
union to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist 
sandinistas but somehow its wrong for the united states to give a 
few dollars to the democratic resistance 
quayle said he still supported the monroe doctrine set forth in 
1823 by president james monroe that the united states would oppose 
any attempt by european powers to interfere in the western 
hemisphere 
and he said 85 percent americans supported the 1983 us 
invasion of grenada but that dukakis had criticized it 
we turned a communist country into a noncommunist country 
quayle said the governor of massachusetts is simply out of step 
with mainstream america 
bentsen noted that both he and dukakis speak spanish and said 
they wanted to launch a new alliance for progress for central 
america and mexico a country with 85 million people sharing a 
2000mile border with us with half of those people under the age 
of 15 a country that has had its standard of living cut 50 percent 
in the last six years 
we ought to be concerned about that and we ought to be 
involved he said bring in the europeans the spanish who 
have a real affinity for that area bring in the japanese who have 
a great capital surplus now and looking for places to invest it 
such investment could foster peace raise the standard of living 
and provide the stability needed for democracy to prosper bentsen

the national assembly said today that 
2670 soldiers committed suicide were beaten to death or died from 
other unnatural causes since 1980 
the figures were provided to the assembly in a defense ministry 
report on deaths in the 650000 member armed forces 
the report said 2254 soldiers committed suicide with the 
remaining 416 killed in assaults by their superiors or fellow 
soldiers or other unspecified causes the deaths were in all 
branches of the armed forces and included officers and enlisted 
personnel 
discipline is notoriously harsh within the south korean armed 
forces younger soldiers can be subjected to beatings and other 
punishments by older personnel despite an official ban on physical 
abuse 
the report also listed 3723 other soldiers and officers killed 
in accidents since 1980 such as explosions mishandling of arms 
and motor vehicle and miltitry aircraft accidents 
korean males are subject to about two years of military 
conscription 
dissidents have claimed some opposition supporters serving in 
the military killed themselves because they could not stand 
surveillance or discriminatory treatment in barracks 
some dissident leaders said they would form a special group to 
investigate the deaths to determine if there had been any improper 
conduct according to seoul newspaper reports 
the defense ministry had to submit the report to the national 
assembly as part of legislative scrutiny on conditions within the 
military 
under the new democratic constitution adopted last year the 
legislature is empowered for the first time in 16 years to inspect 
the military and other branches of government

question let us assume the president is incapacitated 
and you have to take the reins of power what would be the 
first steps that youd take and why 
quayle first id say a prayer for myself and for the country 
that im about to lead and then i would assemble his people and 
talk and i think this question keeps going back to 
qualifications youve got to look at experience and youve got 
to look at accomplishments 
question would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and 
maimed people deregulation may have gone too far and the 
government should reassert itself in protecting workers rights 
quayle there is a commitment and there will always be a 
commitment to the safety of our working men and women in my 
judgement deregulation has worked we have a deregulated economy 
and we have produced through low taxes not high taxes through 
deregulation the spirit of entrepreneurship 
bentsen this administration came in and put in a james watt and 
anne gorsuch now thats the bonnie and clyde really of 
environmental protection and thats why its important that you 
have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working 
men and women of america 
question do you believe its time to target federal money 
to the small and mediumsize farmer 
bentsen i feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for 
the american farmer weve seen an administration that has lost 
much of our market abroad because they have not had a trade policy 
we would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and 
stand up for the american farmer 
quayle the governor of massachusetts went to the farmers in 
the midwest and told them to grow belgium endive thats what 
he and his harvard buddies think of the american farmer 
question two guys come through your door and say wed 
like you to change without offering a lot of specifics why 
would you accept their deal 
bentsen if you let me write 200 billion worth of hot 
checks every year i could give you an illusion of prosperity too 
we need an administration that will turn this trade policy 
around and open up those markets stand tough with our trading 
partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad 
quayle we are proud of the record of accomplishment and the 
opportunities and the hope for millions of americans because of 
the policies that we have had for the last eight years and we want 
to build on that and change it for even the better 
q why not use the military to go after the south american drug 
cartels and after general noriega 
quayle we are using our military assets in a prudent way to 
deal with interdiction but weve got to get on the demand side 
of the ledger weve got to get to education we need to focus 
on law enforcement and heres where we have a major 
disagreement with the governor of massachusetts you cannot be 
tough on drugs and weak on crime 
bentsen wed put one person in charge in the war against drugs 
and wed commit the resources to get that job done 
question you said youd say a prayer if you took over in an 
emergency and you said something about a meeting what would you 
do next 
quayle i know what it takes to lead this country forward 
and if that situation arises yes i will be prepared and ill be 
prepared to lead this country if that happens 
bentsen you have to look at maturity of judgment and you 
have to look at breadth of experience you have to see what kind of 
leadership roles that person has played in his life before that 
crisis struck him 
question surely you must have some plan in mind about what you 
would do if it fell to you to become president 
quayle i will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of 
the presidency of the united states of america i have far more 
experience than many others that sought the office of vice 
president of this country i have as much experience in the 
congress as jack kennedy did when he sought the presidency 
bentsen senator i served with jack kennedy i knew jack 
kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no jack 
kennedy and frankly i think youre so far apart in the 
objectives you choose for your country that i did not think the 
comparison was well taken 
q does the dukakisbentsen ticket have any realistic plan for 
getting the american hostages being held in the middle east 
released in any due time 
bentsen the one thing we ought to have know by now is that 
you cant go out and make secret deals with the ayatollah you 
cant trade arms for hostages 
quayle theres no doubt about it that arms for hostages is 
wrong and it will never be repeated we learn by our mistakes but 
there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this 
administration 
question how do you explain how you can be a social 
conservative and still run with michael dukakis on the national 
ticket 
bentsen michael dukakis wasnt looking for clone i think its 
part of the strength and the character of this man that he reaches 
out and that he wants someone that will speak up and that ill do 
question could you describe what experience you may have 
had and how it shaped your political philosophy 
quayle its the advice that my maternal grandmother martha 
pulliam whos 97 years old she says you can do anything you 
want to if you just set your mind to it an go to work now the 
dukakis supporters sneer at that because its common sense 
bentsen to have spent part of my life seeing some of the 
struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita 
incomes in the united states and thats one of the reasons ive 
worked so hard to try to assist on education 
closing remarks 
quayle the road of george bush is the road to the future 
and it comes down to this an america second to none with visions 
of greatness economic expansion tough laws tough judges strong 
values respect for the flag and our institutions george bush will 
lead us to the 21st century a century that will be of hope and 
peace ronald reagan and george bush saved america from decline we 
changed america george bush has the experience and with me 
the future a future committed to our family a future committed 
to the freedom 
bentsen mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen offer you 
experienced tempered capable leadership to meet those challenges 
of the future america cant just coast into the future 
clinging to the past this race is too close the competition is 
too tough and the stakes are too high mike dukakis says the 
best of america is yet to come its going to take leadership 
and its going to take courage and the commitment and a 
contribution by all of us to do that

a former us government employee emerging as 
a mystery man in reports of fresh reagan administration efforts to 
free american hostages in lebanon denied he tried to negotiate a 
prisoner release with iranian figures 
richard lawless president of a trade and investment consulting 
firm on wednesday sought to refute assertions by former iranian 
president abolhassan banisadr that he has been working on the 
hostage problem behind the scenes on behalf of the administration 
in doing so lawless 44 echoed statements made earlier by 
white house and state department officials seeking to knock down 
banisadrs allegations administration spokesmen have said lawless 
is not a government employee and has not been carrying out any kind 
of mission on behalf of the united states 
president reagan and his aides steadfastly denied all reports 
that the us government is negotiating directly with the iranians 
on the hostage situation 
speaking through the coowner of his firm usasia lawless 
said i categorically deny and state for the record that i am 
involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or 
negotiations with any party related to attempts to secure the 
release of hostages in lebanon 
lawless also said i have never in my entire life had any 
direct or indirect contact with any iranian government officials or 
any iranian nationals claiming to represent the iranian government 
or any iranian related interests 
on tuesday banisadr said in paris that lawless had negotiated 
in behalf of vice president george bush with a representative of 
iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani in an attempt to get 
american hostages liberated 
told of the denials at an interview with the new york times on 
wednesday in paris banisadr amended his account saying he no 
longer was certain lawless was involved in the talks but that it 
was probably him 
speaking on behalf of lawless on wednesday usasia coowner 
therese shaheen said the company felt lawlesss reputation had 
been harmed by the banisadr allegations made in the wake of the 
release earlier this week of hostage mithileshwar singh an 
indianborn us resident 
the story here is why are the iranians fabricating this 
story she said its the biggest hoax since whatever 
meanwhile reagan said again wednesday that he did not foresee 
any new hostage releases following the liberation of singh 
we desperately are hoping continuing to try he said 
ive never been able to explain the iranians what their 
strategies are and what they do he told reporters but 
obviously we could not do any negotiating with them unless and 
until the hostages are released 
last week an israeli newspaper the nation said us 
government officials were engaged in secret talks with iranians in 
geneva aimed at setting the hostages free and improving relations 
between washington and tehran 
banisadr also said a shipment of arms furnished by the united 
states was destined for iran 
those charges are not true none of them top to bottom 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday banisadr 
is full of beans 
lawless also denied that i have any active relationship with 
anyone on the staff of vice president bush or the bush campaign 
organization which relates in any way to this or any similar 
issue 
lawless worked for the cia at the us embassy in seoul south 
korea between 1973 and 1975 the same years that bushs national 
security adviser donald gregg served with the cia at that 
mission the washington times quoted sources as saying 
gregg however has seen lawless fewer than a halfdozen times 
since 1975 and only in social settings the paper quoted its 
sources as saying 
in addition the new york times quoted an unidentified former 
government official as saying lawless had worked in the cias 
operations directorate until several years ago 
bill devine a cia spokesman said we never confirm or deny 
cia allegations of employment 
the state departments biographic register said in its 1974 
edition that lawless 42 had worked as an area analyst for the 
pentagon and the state department starting in june 1972 ms 
shaheen said lawless had assignments at embassies in seoul tokyo 
and vienna austria 
ms shaheen said we showed richards passport plane tickets 
and so forth in an attempt to dissuade cbs news from reporting 
his purported activities on behalf of the hostages but she noted 
that the network had broadcast the report earlier in the week 
he couldnt possibly have been there taking part in any 
discussions about the hostages she said so banisadr said he 
lawless knows a couple people in the bush campaign it was 
like two and two make a thousand we think it is politically 
inspired by iran 
bush spokesmen have said lawless has no relationship with bush 
or with his campaign

a man who said he was fed up with cars 
speeding out of a highschool parking lot has been arrested for 
building two speed bumps at an entrance 
it was the most unique response ive seen to a problem 
fairfax county police lt justin b murphy said wednesday 
however its illegal 
tom alsop 34 was arrested tuesday night and charged with 
destruction of public property he is to appear in court oct 28 
and faces 12 months in jail and a 1000 fine if convicted 
i didnt pursue the right channels i was basically spinning 
my wheels alsop said in hindsight maybe it was a stupid 
thing to do we dont want anything big we just want a little 
help 
alsop who runs a carpet cleaning business near wt woodson 
high school said he sees students speed out of the lot every day 
they also perform burnouts by pouring oil on the road and 
spinning their tires until smoke is generated he said 
at 2 oclock every day you get a burnout session he said 
alsop installed a chainlink fence on his property last year 
after a station wagon landed wheelsup in his yard 
alsop said he has complained about the students driving to 
school officials four times during the last three years to no 
avail so he decided to take action himself 
the 5footlongby2inchhigh bumps were easy to build alsop 
said 
take hot asphalt pour it on the ground and whack it with a 
shovel he said 
alsop removed the bumps after the police arrived 
these were just little bumps alsop said i didnt think i 
was doing any harm 
woodson principal charles e billak said a staff member has been 
assigned to monitor the problem three or four students lost their 
privilege of driving to school last year after being caught doing 
burnouts billak said 
automobiles are a problem he said we could do without 
them

the crowd was rowdy throughout the vice 
presidential debate the candidates were greeted with derisive 
laughter and raucous cheers from alternating sides of an auditorium 
calculatedly divided evenly between republicans and democrats down 
to the very last partisan 
throughout it all lloyd bentsen and dan quayle doggedly stuck to 
their podiums exchanging occasional glares 
it sure wasnt hermetically sealed laughed ed touhy who 
produced the debate program for a bipartisan commission for a 
while i was afraid they were going to rush the stage 
both candidates and workers had spent the week in intense 
preparation over the smallest details and the training was 
apparent from the time the two candidates strode purposefully on 
stage in matching dark suits and similar striped ties 
quayles sole concession to informality was a foot propped 
casually on his podium while bentsen stubbornly gripped a pen in 
his right hand occasionally stabbing the air to underscore a point 
the debate started slowly but tension between the candidates 
grew capped when bentsen glared at quayle and said senator you 
are no jack kennedy 
the two candidates shook hands at the beginning and end but 
there was little warmth in between and the crowd paid scant 
attention to repeated pleas from moderator judy woodruff of the 
macneillehrer newshour television program to react less 
noisily 
the candidates generally stared stonily into space during the 
demonstrations picking up where they left off after it subsided 
im wondering if the rowdiness of the crowd doesnt dictate 
that future debates will be held in television studios rather than 
a public auditorium fouhy said later it was a pretty rowdy 
crowd 
the candidates occasionally had some tensions with their 
questioners also 
pressed repeatedly to give his qualifications for president 
quayle at one point snapped i think this is the fourth time ive 
had this question 
no he was told just the third 
bentsen pressed to explain a fundraising tactic stiffened a 
bit before saying i dont find it embarrassing at all 
organizers made no apologies for the stiffness of the 
arrangements telling reporters it was their job to produce good 
television and thats precisely what came out a television 
program staged as artfully as a sitcom 
this is a television program and weve got some of the best 
production people in the world doing it fouhy said you direct 
a television program so people watching at home have a good idea 
whats happening 
the league of women voters originally was to sponsor the second 
presidential debate next week in los angeles but pulled out 
charging the candidates exercised too much control over the format 
and turned the event into a charade 
that sort of criticism insisted fouhy was a lot of 
nonsense 
im delighted that it went well fouhy said there was 
real substance this was not a battle of the network sound bites 
the show will go on saws and hammers came out within minutes of 
the debates close dismantling a stage that had been shipped to 
omaha from winstonsalem nc and the first debate between 
michael dukakis and george bush 
next stop is los angeles and the final presidential debate

beverly hills residents threw tarpaulins over 
their porsches and ferraris and others stayed indoors wednesday as 
the state prepared a sticky aerial bombardment of mediterranean 
fruit fly pesticide 
but low clouds late wednesday grounded three helicopters that 
were set to spray malathion over a 35squaremile swath of homes 
and businesses west of downtown including sections of beverly 
hills to stop a burgeoning infestation of the cropdestroying pest 
the spraying was rescheduled for thursday night said william 
edwards chief deputy to los angeles countys agricultural 
commissioner 
the target area is densely packed with homes and businesses 
forty medflies have been found in yards since sept 26 indicating 
a serious infestation that if allowed to spread could threaten 
crops worth 8 billion a year statewide authorities said 
while the most exclusive residential sections of beverly hills 
including shaded streets dotted with movie stars mansions were 
not included in the spraying area many of the communitys 
expensive shops and opulent apartment buildings fell into the 
target zone along with other sections of los angeles and other 
municipalities with homes ranging from modest bungalows to estates 
the nearest commercial crops are dozens of miles away from the 
spray area but the pest can spread rapidly medflies lay their 
eggs under the skin of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
hatching maggots that destroy the crop 
the last serious infestation in 1980 and 1981 cost california 
farmers an estimated 100 million we need to get this done as 
quickly as possible edwards said of the spraying 
state experts say the spraying could cause inconvenience but no 
health hazard as the malathion in the small concentrations used is 
harmless to warmblooded animals 
however the pesticide is mixed with a sweet sticky corn syrup 
bait that can damage car paint 
ron ferraro who runs scandinavian auto body scrambled to find 
tarpaulins or garage space for a fleet of alpha romeos in beverly 
hills youre looking at about 7500 in refinishing that would 
have to be done ferraro said 
agricultural commissioner leon spaugy said the fight to save the 
states farm industry knows no economic boundaries were 
encouraging people to cover up their rolls royces just like they 
would cover up their pintos he said 
among the cities and the sections of los angeles in the area are 
culver city palms baldwin hills and west hollywood 
members of the california conservation corps started passing out 
flyers notifying residents of the spraying monday and there have 
been news reports all week but some objected they hadnt been 
warned in time 
west hollywood mayor helen albert in a letter to state 
agriculture officials complained the city hadnt been given enough 
time to warn its residents or assess possible health hazards 
responded edwards they should be mad at the people who caused 
this infestation and thats the people who brought the 
contaminated fruit in were trying to protect the states 
biggest industry and thats agriculture if we dont do this 
farmers are going to have to use a lot more pesticide and fruit is 
going to cost more 
the medfly is native to central america hawaii and other 
tropical areas most california infestations are believed to start 
with flies unwittingly brought home by tourists in illegally 
transported fruit or in fruit mailed from hawaii 
the antimedfly strategy is twofold first the population is 
knocked down with the malathion bait which remains active about a 
week then millions of specially bred sterile flies are released 
so the surviving wild flies mate harmlessly

doctors expressed fears that transfusions may be 
causing emperor hirohitos fever and pulse rate to rise but gave 
him more blood this morning as his internal bleeding continued 
emperor hirohito received 04 pints of blood in a transfusion 
this morning after discharging a small amount of blood according 
to palace officials 
it was the 14thstraight day transfusions have been given to the 
87yearold emperor who has been bedridden since internal 
hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood on sept 19 
kenji maeda head of the general affairs department of the 
imperial household agency told reporters the emperors temperature 
was 10058 degrees as of 900 am wednesday morning his fever was 
9896 degrees 
we cannot rule out the possibility that the emperors fever 
was caused by internal inflammation in the upper digestive tract 
or by the series of blood transfusions or both maeda quoted 
akira takagi the emperors chief physician as saying 
hirohito has so far received a total of 1198 pints in 
transfusions well above the normal amount of blood circulating in 
his body according to news reports 
doctors halted a blood transfusion being given to the emperor 
wednesday afternoon before it was complete because of concern over 
his high temperature and rising pulse rate 
hirohitos temperature and pulse rate rose sharply wednesday as 
doctors administered the transfusion in an attempt to help 
overcome anemia and improve his overall physical condition maeda 
said 
the worlds longestreigning monarch has continued to discharge 
small amounts of blood intermittently since the onset of the crisis 
he has been unable to take solid food except for two small 
fragments of ice and a few spoonfuls of porridge since falling 
sick he is being fed intravenously 
news reports have said hirohito has cancer but palace officials 
have refused to confirm or deny them and have urged the media to 
refrain from making such speculation

the sandinista party has pushed 
through a law that grants president daniel ortega sweeping powers 
to make arrests and silence news media during a state of emergency 
also wednesday the government banned nicaraguans from receiving 
any type of official us aid 
the new emergency law went into effect immediately after it was 
approved by the leftist sandinistas 61seat majority in the 
96seat national assembly it allows the president to declare a 
state of emergency and restrict civil liberties for reasons of war 
economic crisis or national disasters 
in a statement the opposition popular social christian party 
decried the law as an unrestrained concentration of extraordinary 
powers that could render ortega an absolute dictator 
a national state of emergency decree was in effect from march 
1982 until shortly after a central american peace plan was signed 
by the regions presidents in august 1987 
under the new law the president can declare a state of 
emergency that permits the government to temporarily confiscate 
privatelyowned businesses and vehicles it empowers the executive 
to suspend broadcast and print media and communications services 
when necessary to maintain public order 
it also gives the government sweeping powers of arrest and 
preventive detention of individuals deemed dangerous persons 
and requires all individuals traveling in war zones to carry 
identification documents 
meanwhile the external cooperation ministry announced a ban on 
all cash or inkind assistance connected with funds approved by 
the us government including humanitarian aid for victims of 
the sevenyear civil war between the government and usbacked 
rebels known as contras 
ortega also sent a bill to the assembly that would make receipt 
of any official us aid crimes against the internal and external 
security of the state the assembly will consider the legislation 
beginning friday 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
wednesday the reagan administration was considering seeking 
congressional approval for release of 165 million in stockpiled 
military aid for the nicaraguan rebels 
also wednesday nicaraguas interior ministry protested a report 
by the countrys sole opposition newspaper la prensa that three 
activists with the confederation of trade union unity were fatally 
shot sunday by three men wearing sandinista army uniforms in leon 
about 45 miles west of managua 
the ministry said the report tuesday brazenly falsified the 
truth of the facts to make it appear those slain were victims 
of government repression because of their activities in the labor 
group 
the ministry statement listed other examples of reporting in la 
prensa it considered biased or erroneous and ordered the newspaper 
to print the government statement in todays editions 
it is evident that the principal objective of this campaign is 
to offer the reagan administration those elements that will permit 
it to accuse our government of being a violator of the most 
fundamental human rights the ministry statement said

dan quayle withstood his midterm exam but 
the democrats arent relenting in their campaign to flunk the 
republican vice presidential nominee 
in 90 minutes of pressurized debate with democrat lloyd bentsen 
quayle held his own there were no significant blunders by either 
man in the running mate debate 
an abc news poll immediately after the debate found 51 percent 
thought bentsen had won 27 percent said quayle and 22 percent 
thought it a tie the margin of error in the survey of 637 people 
was 45 percentage points 
republican quayle faced the more difficult debate assignment 
because he is the candidate found by public opinion polls to be a 
drag on his ticket he has come under constant campaign attack and 
he faced the tougher set of sometimes repetitive debate questions 
bentsen fills a more traditional no 2 role he isnt an issue 
he is rather a bridge between democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis and his partys more conservative branch 
at the start of the omaha neb debate quayle was asked to 
defend his credentials and qualifications for the vice presidency 
and if need be the presidency itself that meshed with the theme 
bentsen came to stress that the debate really dealt with the 
presidency itself and whether he or quayle is the better man to 
take on the job if necessary 
he and democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis argue 
every day that the answer on quayle is no and the debate had 
hardly ended before dukakis repeated that theme telling a boston 
rally that bentsen had proved again he could take over the 
presidency if he has to while quayle could not 
that points to a campaign theme that is sure to be part of the 
democratic litany until nov 8 postdebate comments predictably 
fit that pattern 
neither scored a knockout but lloyd bentsen looked and 
sounded more presidential said democratic sen paul simon of 
illinois a former candidate for his partys prize 
quayle clearly had done his homework for the debate test when 
the first questioner recited criticism of his military and academic 
records and disparaging comments by republicans quayle said the 
question behind it all was of his qualifications to be vice 
president and in the case of tragedy whether im qualified to be 
president 
the indiana senator 41 said it isnt a question of age but of 
accomplishments and experience insisted that he has both 
especially on national security jobs and education and the 
federal budget 
on each one of those issues i have more experience than does 
the governor of massachusetts he said and repeatedly i am 
prepared to lead this country if the gop ticket wins and that 
becomes necessary 
quayle stuck to that line all night 
the panel of questioners three television and one print 
journalist went back to the topic repeatedly three times by 
asking what first step quayle would take if he ever became 
president thats an unanswerable question since no vice president 
could know what hed do without knowing the circumstances of his 
succession it was not asked of bentsen 
each time quayle went back to his formula claiming strength on 
the big three issues 
but he varied it enough to trigger the debates sharpest 
exchange saying that he has as much experience now as john f 
kennedy had when he ran for president 
senator i served with jack kennedy i knew jack kennedy jack 
kennedy was a friend of mine said bentsen senator youre no 
jack kennedy 
that was really uncalled for senator an angry quayle 
retorted 
kennedy had served 14 years in congress eight in the senate 
before he became president in 1960 quayle has been a senator for 
eight years and served four in the house 
bentsen took a share of sharp questions on his political 
fundraising tactics and also about his differences with dukakis on 
such topics as aid to the nicaraguan contras the death penalty and 
gun control the texas senator favors the first two opposes gun 
control dukakis holds opposite positions bentsen said they agree 
on most issues then changed the subject 
quayle tried to make make an issue of that saying he wouldnt 
try to defend a liberal like dukakis either 
but he remained the focus and he is certain to remain a prime 
target in the five weeks until election day

military president augusto pinochet lost 
a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in power until 
1997 government and opposition returns showed thursday 
the defeat sets the stage for open elections next year 
in a speech broadcast nationwide on television and radio 
interior minister sergio fernandez formally conceded pinochets 
defeat at 240 am 140 am edt 
we abide by the results which the country already knows 
fernandez said 
earlier air force commander general fernando matthei a member 
of the lawmaking military junta said it seem to me that the 
no vote has won 
we are calm we are going to analyze the situation matthei 
added as he entered the downtown government palace at 1 am for an 
emergency meeting with pinochet the fourman junta and the 
15member cabinet 
shortly after mattheis statement the interior ministry at 210 
am announced for the first time substantial voting returns that 
showed the vote against pinochets continued rule prevailing it 
earlier had said pinochet was winning 
with 15969 of the countrys 22248 voting tables reporting the 
ministry counted 2754805 votes or 533 percent against 
pinochet and 2290972 votes or 443 percent supporting the 
president 
there were also 53292 blank votes and 68108 votes voided for 
being wrongly marked 
an earlier opposition tally gave the no vote an even wider 
margin with pinochet losing 578 percent to 399 percent 
patricio aylwin president of the christian democratic party and 
spokesman for the coalition declared its clear that the 
majority of chileans have voted no 
on wednesday in balloting that was peaceful and heavily 
attended chileans voted on a proposal by pinochet and other 
military commanders that he remain president until 1997 the 
rightwing 72yearold army chief seized power in a bloody coup in 
1973 that ousted the 3yearold elected government of president 
salvador allende a marxist who died during the takeover 
if he had won pinochet would have assumed a new 8year term in 
march by losing an open presidential election is to be held late 
next year and the winner would assume power in march 1990 with 
pinochet remaining in power until then 
earlier military patrols in armored personnel carriers and 
trucks with mounted machine guns were seen circulating in 
workingclass neighborhoods and slums where antipinochet 
sentiment traditionally runs high that ring the capital a few 
hundred people danced in the streets of la victoria slum in 
southern santiago waving banners and celebrating an anticipated 
no victory 
we all voted no because we are repressed said one 
participant 50yearold construction worker jose garrido 
jorge zincke military commander for the santiago area reported 
scattered incidents after the voting which he said were being 
controlled by police he said antigovernment demonstrators erected 
barricades in the streets of san bernardo south of the capital 
and puente alto to the southeast 
he said six people were arrested for carrying arms and a public 
bus was burned and its driver beaten 
santiagos streets were mainly empty as most chileans heeded 
opposition calls to stay at home 
pinochet said earlier in an interview broadcast by radio 
cooperativa of santiago so far everything is calm but ive got 
some information that leaves me thinking there are some people who 
have seen individuals wearing skimasks he gave no details 
leftist urban guerrillas commonly employ ski masks but both of 
chiles guerrilla groups have publicly announced a truce until 
after the voting day 
a huge turnout among the 74 million registered voters slowed 
balloting at many polling places and could delay definitive 
tallies authorities said voting tables started closing at 5 pm 
and the counting began 
foreign observers said the plebiscite appeared to be open and 
honestly conducted 
former president oswaldo hurtado of ecuador an observer said 
what i have seen is chileans being able to cast their votes 
freely and in private 
official returns from the national election service are not 
expected until friday 
voting is mandatory and those who dont vote can be fined up to 
22000 pesos or about 80 
in santiago the capital city where more than onethird of the 
nations 12 million people live some voters showed up an hour 
before polls began opening at 8 am lines more than a mile long 
had formed by midmorning under bright sunlight in the southern 
hemisphere spring 
pinochet smiling and wearing a beige civilian suit voted at a

the government says it will ban public 
drinking in eight english cities next year in an experimental 
crackdown on socalled lager louts rowdy youths who get drunk 
on americanstyle beer 
home secretary douglas hurd said the bans would take effect 
early next year in coventry bath farnborough chester st 
austell scarborough aldershot and newquay 
the government does not want to restrict personal freedom 
hurd told a legal conference wednesday but it is not clever 
masculine or attractive to drink yourself into a state where you 
break windows or hit or stab a policemen 
the twoyear experimental program calls for local governments to 
work with the home office to enact bylaws empowering the courts to 
levy 170 fines against people who drink alcohol outdoors 
the measure follows a wave of summer violence in britains 
suburbs and rural towns by young men most of them between the ages 
of 18 and 26 who gather on weekends and drink on the streets or in 
local pubs 
they have been blamed for brawls vandalism and attacks on 
unarmed police called to disperse the drunken rowdy crowds 
police estimate dozens of officers have been injured in 
confrontations nationwide with the socalled lager louts lager 
is a pale americanstyle beer favored by the young as opposed to 
the dark traditional bitter english beer 
traditionally britons have been allowed to consume alcohol in 
parks or on the streets particularly during the afternoon when 
pubs are closed 
but the 73yearold pubclosing law was repealed aug 22 giving 
people who want a pint of beer in the afternoon the option to drink 
indoors 
hurd said wednesday he had misgivings about making drinking on 
the streets a criminal offense 
but i concluded that the distress caused to ordinary 
citizens by groups of mainly young people becoming drunk and 
behaving badly was such that it was worth trying a bylaw he 
said 
in a meeting today with the chief police officers association in 
the northern city of preston hurd was to be asked to endorse 
another experimental program installing video cameras in downtown 
areas to keep on eye on drunken youths

a roman catholic priest who was caught 
with 46 pounds of cocaine says he is innocent of drug trafficking 
and insists he will remain a priest for the rest of his life 
father jose luis gil fernandez who turned 58 on wednesday said 
he felt tranquil after a venezuelan public prosecutor requested 
a 20 year sentence this week for gil for trafficking in drugs 
the prosecutor pablo gonzalez also asked for 15 years in jail 
for juan rojano martinez a former priest whom gil implicated as 
the man who forced him to deal in drugs 
gonzalez requested a stiffer sentence for gil because he 
allegedly used his status as a minister of god to facilitate the 
drug dealing 
i am totally innocent i am going to wait all this out and i 
will continue being a priest for the rest of my life gil said 
prior to his second hearing before judge aura chaparro of the 40th 
first circuit penal tribunal in caracas 
the silverhaired priest clutched a redbound bible in his hand 
and had a small silver cross pinned to his navy blue knit vest 
gil was arrested last april by venezuelan intelligence police in 
simon bolivar international airport outside caracas as he tried to 
smuggle the cocaine onto a plane bound for madrid 
rojano who left the priesthood 27 years ago and his wife 
graciela were arrested in their caracas residence hours after gil 
police found 180 grams of cocaine and cash in the house 
rojanos lawyer hugo albarran said prior to the hearing 
gil is spanishborn but was the parish priest of san mateo 36 
miles west of caracas for 30 years according to gils lawyer 
edoardo petricone chiarilli he has given up the parish post since 
his arrest 
gil is apparently the first priest ever to be tried for drug 
trafficking 
petricone said gil is pleading innocent because he was coerced 
into carrying drugs by rojano albarran said rojano is pleading 
innocent because he was falsely accused by gil 
according to petricone gil inadvertently got involved in 
trafficking in 1984 when he carried a package of unknown content to 
spain as a favor to rojano 
rojano and gil have known each other for 20 years according to 
rojanos lawyer hugo albarran 
upon gils return rojano notified him the package contained 
cocaine and threatened to expose gil to public shame if he 
refused to carry more drugs petricone said 
he said the only other times the priest carried cocaine to spain 
were in january 1988 and again last april when he was arrested 
judge chaparro who is stepping in for vacationing judge 
francisco caracciolo lamus indicated that a decision on gil and 
rojano will not be made until november at the earliest 
drug trafficking carries a sentence of up to 30 years in 
venezuela

chileans grew frustrated with long lines 
that snaked outside polling stations but many believed the 
national referendum on whether gen augusto pinochet should 
continue as president would be fair and accurate 
the interior ministry conceded early today that pinochet had 
lost the referendum voters had been asked to decide whether 
pinochet who seized power in a 1973 military coup should continue 
to rule this south american nation until 1997 
open elections for a new president are to be held next year 
during wednesdays balloting many chileans seemed confident 
that their vote would count 
ill respect the results even if pinochet wins said jose 
casanova a 63yearold retired farmer standing outside a polling 
station in a workingclass northern suburb i think pinochet will 
respect the results even if he loses 
anyone who wants to can vote no that doesnt happen in cuba 
and a lot of other countries said geronima lopez rodrigo 54 
who was waiting her turn in the affluent providencia neighborhood 
of santiago we have a beautiful democracy with order and 
discipline 
about 74 million people were registered to vote voting is 
mandatory and turnout was heavy across this narrow country wedged 
between the snowcapped andes mountains and the pacific 
anyone who did not vote soon after polls opened at 8 am risked 
a long wait under a glaring spring sun 
men removed their sport coats and sweaters and women standing 
in separate lines fanned themselves or held kerchiefs over their 
heads government television said two elderly voters in the cities 
of la serena and coyhaique suffered heart attacks and died just 
before or after voting 
but few people grumbled and even fewer went home without voting 
i took three buses to get here said carmen reyes at a 
southern santiago polling place 
housewife sonia azoca in the northern neighborhood of conchali 
said ive been here half an hour ill probably be here an hour 
more however long it takes ill be here 
national police in white suspenders holsters and carrying 
batons were posted at each of the 1000 polling stations 
nationwide otherwise the military was barely visible in the 
capitals streets sidewalks and parks which were practically 
deserted 
after voting most people took the advice of the government the 
opposition and the roman catholic church they went home 
not one of more than a dozen voters interviewed doubted the vote 
count would be fast and accurate 
fraud is impossible said fabiola escuer 24 both sides 
are counting the vote and there are observers from many countries

surinames new president has asked france 
and the netherlands to help his nation halt recruitment of 
mercenaries and arms shipments that he says are fortifying 
antigovernment rebels 
president ramsewak shankar whose january inauguration ended 
seven years of military rule told the 43rd un general assembly 
in new york on wednesday that suriname has inherited serious 
social and economic problems that could become a threat to our 
national unity and political stability if not urgently addressed 
he said one problem involves about 10000 refugees in eastern 
suriname who fled a guerrilla war by troops loyal to former private 
ronnie brunswijk he is a former bodyguard to desi bouterse who 
shankar replaced in january after seven years of leftist military 
rule 
my government is making every effort to have dialogue to end 
the insurgency which has often resulted in violent acts off 
terrorism shankar said wednesday 
suriname a small nation of 370000 people north of brazil has 
never directly accused the netherlands or france of aiding the 
insurrection 
but shankar said wednesday that suriname is faced with the 
problem that the insurgents are aided and abetted by external 
forces whose chief aim is the continuation of violence through the 
provision of arms and the recruitment and financing of 
mercenaries 
he said his government is seeking help from france and the 
netherlands in stopping arms deliveries and recruitment of foreign 
mercenaries 
brunswijks forces have wide support among the 350000member 
surinamese expatriot community in the netherlands

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle says he could take over as president if a tragedy made that 
necessary telling a debate audience the first thing he would do if 
that happened is pray for himself and the country 
the question dogged the 41yearold senator from indiana 
throughout his debate wednesday night with democratic vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen who from the beginning 
maintained the key issue was who was best qualified to be president 
not no 2 
reporters putting the questions to the two candidates appeared 
to agree returning to it three times after moderator judy woodruff 
opened the debate with a comment that based on the experiences 
since world war ii there is a 5050 chance that quayle or bentsen 
could be thrust into the oval office on a moments notice 
first id say a prayer for myself and for the country that 
im about to lead quayle said and then i would assemble his 
people and talk 
bentsen a 67yearold senator from texas answered in more 
general terms saying the central issue was maturity of 
judgment and breadth of experience 
he started to get specific at one point saying what has to 
be done in a situation like that is to call in the joint but 
was interrupted by audience reaction and never finished the 
reference may have been to the joint chiefs of staff 
the audience reaction was in response to bentsens statement to 
quayle senator youre no jack kennedy quayle had said he has 
as much experience in congress as kennedy did when he sought and 
won the presidency in 1960 
quayle said he is prepared to carry out the duties of the 
presidency not only because of my service in the congress but 
because of my ability to communicate and to lead 
its not just age its accomplishments its experience he 
said citing his authorship with sen edward m kennedy dmass 
of the job training partnership act for training unskilled and 
workers and retraining displaced ones i have far more experience 
than many others that sought the office of vice president 
expanding on what his first actions would be in reaction to the 
fourth occasion in the debate when the question was posed quayle 
said he would call in members of the cabinet and the presidents 
white house advisers and talk to them and work with them 
ill know them on a firsthand basis because im going to be 
coordinating the drug effort because as vice president ill sit 
in on the national security council because vice president george 
bush is going to recreate the space council and ill be in charge 
of that he said i will have daytoday activities with all 
the people in government 
bentsen didnt escape unscathed on the same issue 
he was queried about the fairness of his and democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis repeated campaign remarks 
questioning quayles qualifications when bentsen had unsuccessfully 
sought the presidency in 1976 with less experience than quayle has 
now 
i must say i didnt do a very good job of running for the 
presidency bentsen said but what were looking at today is 
trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and maturity 
of someone taking on this kind of task

foreign observers who watched as chileans 
decided whether gen augusto pinochet should remain as president 
said the balloting appeared fair but frequently disorganized 
what i have seen is chileans being able to cast their votes 
freely and in private said oswaldo hurtado former president 
of ecuado 
the interior ministry said early today that a majority voted 
against pinochet remaining as president until 1997 new elections 
are to be held next year 
opposition groups fearful of fraud by the government had urged 
foreign dignitaries to monitor the vote more than 500 politicians 
diplomats and a few celebrities including nicaraguan actress 
bianca jagger chose to do so 
some polling stations were badly organized some opened late 
and consequently will have to remain open longer this evening but 
in general it has gone rather well said johanna may weggen 
a european parliament delegate from the netherlands 
former presidents adolfo suarez of spain and misael pastrana of 
colombia and bruce babbitt former governor of arizona led a 
60member delegation of the national democratic institute for 
international affairs based in washington 
they visited polling stations in santiago and 10 other cities 
but said they would not comment formally until a news conference 
friday 
some delegation members said privately they thought the vote was 
free and open and expected the tally also would be they said 
civilians police and military guards at the polling stations were 
friendly and helpful 
the puebla institute a roman catholic human rights group based 
in washington reported signs of governmentsponsored harassment in 
recent days such as a mass mailing apparently intended to mislead 
voters into invalidating their registration cards 
after touring polling stations wednesday however the institute 
issued a statement saying 
despite a climate of intimidation assorted dirty tricks by 
government supporters extended delays in opening some polling 
places long lines to vote and other irregularities chileans in 
great numbers turned out to vote today 
chileans are taking the first real step toward democracy in 15 
years we have heard much about chiles economic miracle today 
we are witnessing the start of a democracy miracle

qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency dan quayle 
and lloyd bentsen also locked horns over social security 
environmental protection campaign finance and other issues in 
their sole facetoface campaign showdown 
here is a look at some of the major issues they argued over in 
wednesday nights debate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
quayle asked to be judged by his experience on the three 
biggest issues that are going to be confronting america in the next 
presidency national security and arms control jobs and 
education and the federal budget deficit 
he said his work in congress including his authorship of the 
job training partnership act of 1983 has established his 
credentials on each one of those issues i have more experience 
than does the governor of massachusetts said the 41yearold 
quayle 
but when the republican said he was no younger than john f 
kennedy when he ran for president the 67yearold bentsen said he 
knew kennedy and senator youre no jack kennedy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bentsen said quayle had voted eight times to cut the benefits 
on social security 
thats wrong said quayle 
bentsen said the reagan administration had tried repeatedly to 
make deep cuts in social security and vice president george bush 
cast a tiebreaking vote in 1985 to freeze benefits when you 
talk about social security the people that are going to protect it 
are the democrats who brought forth that program he said 
but quayle said bentsen himself had voted twice to delay the 
social security costofliving adjustments and dukakis had 
supported a freeze at the national governors conference he said 
what the democrats try to do time and time again is to scare the 
old people of this country

quayle asked why he had voted twothirds of the time 
against environmental protection legislation said i have a very 
strong record on the environment in the united states senate he 
said he voted for the superfund and to override a reagan veto of 
the clean water act 
quayle also blamed dukakis for boston harbors being the 
dirtiest waterway in america 
bentsen derided the late conversion to environmentalism and 
charged it was this administration their administration that 
cut out the money early on to be able to clean up boston 
harbor he said the democrats were responsible for the superfund 
and the clean air and water acts

asked why he had voted for cuts in school nutrition and against 
expanding the childhood immunization program quayle said this 
administration and a george bush administration will be committed 
to eradicating poverty poverty hasnt gone up in this 
administration it hasnt gone down much either and that means 
that we have a challenge ahead of us he said tax reform had 
taken 6 million working poor families off the tax rolls 
the poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating 
jobs and opportunities said the indiana senator 
bentsen charged quayle was of no help at all in the recently 
passed overhaul of welfare laws 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bentsen acknowledged disagreeing with his running mate on 
military aid for the contra rebels in nicaragua but bentsen said 
he and dukakis both support the arias peace plan for central 
america including diplomatic pressure on nicaragua i really 
think we have to give peace a chance he said 
quayle said a dukakis administration would cut off aid to the 
resistance in nicaragua he said dukakis had also opposed the us 
military intervention in grenada 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
asked if he was embarrassed at being the senates biggest 
recipient of contributions from political action committees 
bentsen said he plays by the laws as they are just like when 
youre paying taxes or youre playing a football game 
but bentsen acknowledged his 10000aplate breakfast club 
for lobbyists was a real doozie of a mistake which he quickly 
ended 
quayle said he disbanded the club but hes still got the 
money since most of the lobbyists forked over donations anyway 
to the senate finance committee chairmans campaign 
bentsen said quayle had pocketed more than a quartermillion 
dollars in speech honoraria from special interest groups 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
quayle defended the reaganbush efforts to relax government 
regulation of business and denied it had weakened protection of 
worker safety he charged the democrats want a centralized 
government but we believe in the market we believe in the 
people

people and thats why you have to have osha he said the 
democrats would do a better job of safeguarding workers

bentsen charged that the reagan administration doubled the 
national debt in less than eight years if you let me write 200 
billion worth of hot checks every year i could give you an 
illusion of prosperity too he said 
quayle said the republicans elped create 17 million new jobs and 
rebuilt respect for america in the world

beverly hills took cover but fog grounded 
the states aerial insecticide attack on the mediterranean fruit 
fly in the ritzy neighborhood and other areas where the 
cropdestroying pest has invaded 
the postponement gave about 100000 residents another day to 
protect their porsches rolls royces and expensive outdoor statuary 
against thousands of gallons of sticky mixture containing malathion 
the mission was rescheduled for 7 tonight 
some residents still doubted whether there has been sufficient 
notice but one mercedes benz dealer evacuated his highpriced 
rolling stock into an underground parking garage and other car 
dealers looked for tarps 
im surprised with the way they notified us said resident 
kevin riley the way they notified us has been so lowkey that i 
question whether there has been adequate notification 
three helicopters scheduled to spray over a 35squaremile area 
of homes and businesses west of downtown late wednesday stayed at 
santa monica airport after the fog rolled in from the ocean 
officials said 
it was just too dangerous to try it said robert donley at 
the states medfly hotline they want to try it earlier the 
earlier they spray the better the chances they avoid the fog 
the spraying was ordered because 40 medflies were found in yards 
since sept 26 signaling a serious infestation that if allowed to 
spread could threaten californias 8 billion in crops 
the medfly a native to central america hawaii and other 
tropical areas is believed to be brought to california unwittingly 
by tourists or on illegally transported fruit mailed from hawaii 
if the allnight eighthour spraying assault wipes out enough 
medflies officials will release sterile flies to breed with the 
surviving insects to render them sterile donley said 
most of the exclusive residential sections of beverly hills 
including the mansions of hollywoods rich and famous are spared 
of the spraying but posh rodeo drive shops and many car 
dealerships are in the target area 
the pesticide poses no health risks officials say but the 
sticky corn syrup bait mixed with the malathion could mess up a 
cars paint job museums in the area covered their outdoor statues 
ron ferraro who runs scandinavian auto body in beverly hills 
scrambled to find tarpaulins or garage space wednesday for a fleet 
of alfa romeos 
youre looking at about 7500 in refinishing that would have 
to be done ferraro said 
but agricultural commissioner leon spaugy said the fight to save 
the states farm industry knows no economic boundaries 
were encouraging people to cover up their rolls royces just 
like they would cover up their pintos he said 
along with parts of beverly hills officials are spraying the 
los angeles sections of culver city palms baldwin hills and west 
hollywood 
these communities all are dozens of miles from the nearest 
commercial crops but the pest can spread rapidly it lays its eggs 
under the skin of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables hatching 
maggots that destroy the crop 
the last serious infestation in 1980 and 1981 cost california 
farmers an estimated 100 million

congress is in washington but a big chunk of 
the senate assembled in omaha as dan quayle and lloyd bentsens 
colleagues came to give reporters instant analyses of their vice 
presidential debate they said of the rivals things a senator 
normally never says about a senator 
things like cheap shot knockout blow vicious and 
unbecoming one senator said he was embarrassed for another 
protocol took a powder its not the way they talk back in the 
capitol 
more than two dozen lawmakers from both parties were flown in 
for the showdown on spin alley the area of the press hall 
where campaign officials circulated to share with reporters their 
views of the debates in hopes of influencing what got said on the 
air or put in print 
each team had rented a charter to jet their players from 
washington into omaha for the night and they sent in so many that 
the spinners nearly crushed the press trying to write down their 
reactions 
most of them flowed in two streams one from each party that 
quickly filled the hall minutes after the contest ended bushs 
campaign chairman james a baker iii rated a briefing all his own 
outside the debate hall 
before the debate the two campaigns briefed the surrogates 
afterward verdicts in hand the responses were predictable and 
they didnt always fit the decorum they practice in the capitol 
for the democrats the big topic was bentsens assertion to 
quayle that he was no jack kennedy 
i thought that was the knockout blow of the evening said 
sen alan cranston dcalif 
i think he quayle invited it and it was a devastating 
reply when someone seeks to compare himself with someone i think 
it is very appropriate to say it like it is said sen bennett 
johnston dla 
sen albert gore dtenn who had sought the presidency and was 
a top choice for the vice presidency slot said he was 
embarrassed for quayle 
i thought that he would do well i thought this was the chance 
to rehabilitate himself all he had to do was to come in and look 
halfway decent and avoid serious mistakes he said 
the republicans called the kennedy exchange a cheap shot and 
insisted their senate colleague put to rest any doubts that he was 
qualified to be president 
that is going to get sorted out in this whole game as a 
vicious little spot sen alan simpson rwyo i think it was a 
cheap shot that was very unbecoming of lloyd bentsen 
the expectation that dan quayle was going to come across this 
evening as vastly inferior to lloyd bentsen was totally a myth 
said sen pete v domenici rnm he came out quite to the 
contrary a very competent person given the most difficult 
questions that anyone has ever been given 
bentsens kennedy comment was vicious and quayles fault was 
not being vicious enough in response he said quayle should have 
said in the rebuttal neither is michael dukakis domenici said 
in what could be seen as perhaps the ultimate counterspin to 
the testy atmosphere sen bob packwood rore and rep dennis 
eckart dohio quayles bentsen and bentsens quayle in 
mockdebate preparations stood and posed for pictures in the 
press hall as the crowd finally started to thin out near midnight 
in addition to the officials spinning each campaign 
released a list of what were claimed to be distortions and 
misstatements by the opposition the republicans won that battle 
their list was out a good hour before the democrats responded 
some of the spinners didnt wait until after the debate to offer 
their views a practice one wag called forespin and the 
reaction was always in line with the party line 
i think dan quayle is more of an issue now than he was 90 
minutes ago said susan estrich campaign manager for the dukakis 
campaign that was about an hour before the debate even started 
but she said it again after the debate too

planes to and from chicago are being delayed 
safely on the ground in an unprecedented attempt to reduce 
congestion and the growing number of air traffic controller errors 
at the nations busiest airport officials say 
the federal aviation administrations move comes after 
controllers at ohare international airport made four mistakes in 
less than a week 
in those incidents planes were allowed to get too close to each 
other officials said none resulted in accidents 
so far this year controllers at ohare have made 30 mistakes 
compared with 12 in all of 1987 the faa said 
i cant explain the reason said don zochert an faa 
spokesman thats the question everybody wants the answer to and 
if there was an easy solution wed have it 
under the plan which was announced wednesday but had taken 
effect earlier this week flights to chicago will be delayed on the 
ground in their cities of origin rather than in the air over ohare 
and the smaller midway airport here when there is too much traffic 
said faa spokeswoman barbara dettmer 
during peak periods usually between 445 pm and 915 pm 
cdt daily the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land 
in good weather will be reduced to about 155 per hour from 180 ms 
dettmer said the number is curtailed further during poor weather 
the plan also will affect some flights at midway because the 
airports share air space 
the policy resulted in a total of up to 243 delays at ohare on 
monday and tuesday and up to 33 delays at midway on tuesday 
according to reports published today the weather was good on both 
days the faa defines a delay as a flight landing at least 15 
minutes later than its scheduled arrival time 
this is a new program said ted burcham manager of the 
faas great lakes region air traffic division we could be 
accused of being a bit overcautious if the approach weve taken is 
too severe but its preliminary and were going to adjust it as we 
use the program and see what it does for us 
asked if the controller errors worry the faa burcham replied 
tremendously i am losing sleep over it 
controllers at ohare the nations busiest airport made two 
errors friday one sunday and one tuesday zochert said 
in comparison atlantas hartsfield international airport the 
nations second busiest has had six errors this year and 
washingtons national airport just two officials said 
the latest incidents here came just two months after the 
national transportation safety board issued a report saying that 
chronic understaffing of controllers mandatory overtime outdated 
equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at ohare 
in tuesdays incident a united airlines jet and a smaller 
simmons airlines plane came within 500 feet of each other 13 miles 
east of ohare zochert said 
on sunday two united jets came within 500 feet of each other 
after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended 
for the other 
on friday two air wisconsin jets came near each other when a 
controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to 
descend from 14000 feet to 11000 the faa said 
also friday an american airlines jet and a delta air lines jet 
came within 400 feet vertically and a mile horizontally when the 
pilot of the american plane apparently failed to repeat an order to 
reduce speed and the controller did not seek confirmation the faa 
said 
the faa requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum 
of three miles horizontally and 1000 feet vertically

the government says new safety guidelines for 
the savannah river plant that makes radioactive material for 
nuclear arms were lost in paper work for a month last summer 
during the delay the plant operator waited 40 hours before 
notifying the department of energy of a small power surge that 
caused the shutdown of one of three atomic reactors at the plant 
becky craft a department spokeswoman said wednesday 
the delay violated both the new and the previous guidelines she 
said and efforts have been made to improve procedures 
savannah river is the only us facility which produces 
weaponsgrade plutonium and tritium 
doe and the ei du pont nemours amp co which operates the plant 
under contract have come under fire in recent days because of 
disclosures that during a 28year period up to 30 significant 
reactor mishaps there were not reported to the public and in some 
cases to washington 
the power surge in august triggered a review by an internal 
energy department team which found the p reactor involved suffers 
from numerous and longstanding problems with its control rods 
which act as accelerators and brakes on a reactors rate of fission 
that may prevent operators from recognizing potentially dangerous 
conditions in its core the washington post reported today 
technical support personnel stated they routinely calculate 
core reactivity assuming seven rods are not in their programmed 
positions the teams report said according to the post the 
newspaper said it obtained a copy of the study which has not been 
released publicly 
the new york times reported in todays editions that a study by 
a consulting firm of the plants operations from 19711987 shows 
that chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures caused 
nuclear reactors there to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a 
year for nearly two decades 
that rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry 
and richard w starostecki does chief safety operator told the 
newspaper that civilian reactors with the same number of forced 
shutdowns would have had their operating licenses revoked 
meanwhile an internal memorandum about a may 10 1965 accident 
at the savannah river plant said a supervisor had to stop a foreman 
from taking action that could have turned a leak of cooling water 
into a catastrophic accident the times reported from aiken sc 
near where the plant is located 
one trained man stood between us and disaster said the memo 
written by a du pont engineer frederick b christensen in 1981 
when he took early retirement christensen had been in the reactor 
control room when the incident occurred 
a technical supervisor at the plant gerald f merz told the 
times in an interview wednesday that this was a premature 
conclusion 
the department of energy in an internal report obtained by the 
the state of columbia sc criticized savannah rivers management 
as isolated and said the plant is operated counter to practices 
common to wellrun nuclear plants 
the 50page draft memorandum criticized less than precise and 
outofdate operating practices throughout the plants management 
and reactor staff the newspaper reported today 
written by a panel of doe officials and represenatives from 
companies working at the plant the report criticized du pont and 
doe for allowing reactor operators to grow complacent it called 
for streamlined communications and better training to handle 
emergencies 
as part of an effort to improve safety and reporting procedures 
at savannah river energy undersecretary joseph salgado issued a 
new order on june 21 requiring the contractor and the regional 
energy department office in aiken to notify the washington 
headquarters immediately in the event of a safety problem 
the notice did not reach the mailroom of the regional office 
until july 7 nearly three weeks after it was issued and it took 
another month to reach the appropriate office in aiken said ms 
craft the regional department office asked for clarification from 
washington and did not send the new guidance to du pont until aug 
23 she said 
in the meantime there was another mishap a small power pulse on 
aug 7 which caused the reactor to be shut down on aug 9 
since the incident in august said ms craft we have worked 
with du pont to correct any deficiencies that we had there are 
several programs that du pont has put in place to prevent this from 
occurring in the future she said 
du pont spokesmen did not immediately return telephone calls to 
their offices in aiken

the dollar dipped slightly against the japanese yen 
today while share prices fell sharply on the tokyo stock exchange 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which lost 9553 points 
wednesday lost another 23315 points or 085 percent to finish 
trading at 2717234 the index fell for the fifth straight day for 
the first time this year 
an analyst at nomura securities said the markets poor 
performance stemmed from uncertainty before the release of us 
unemployment figures for september scheduled for friday 
and of course another major reason is the condition of the 
emperor although very few people mention it directly he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
emperor hirohito 87 has been in serious condition since he 
vomited blood sept 19 
trading was light with volume on the first section estimated at

wednesdays close of 13348 yen opening slightly higher at 13337 
yen the currency ranged between 13330 and 13353 yen 
the dollaryen rate was moving very little as investors traded 
the currencies only for their speculative reasons and position 
adjustment said mitsuhiko kinugasa of the daiwa bank in tokyo 
other dealers said the market lacked incentives and dealers were 
cautious while awaiting the us unemployment report

after lurching through bloodshed and 
political upheaval burma is almost back to where it was 11 weeks 
ago with an authoritarian government and few prospects for the 
democracy that once seemed so close 
since the resignation of strongman ne win on july 23 several 
thousand people have died hundreds of thousands marched in the 
streets in a nationwide uprising and three leaders took turns at 
the helm 
now some western experts say the best hope for the 
prodemocracy forces is that the government will offer political 
and economic liberalization to appease an angry population 
pressure for change they say may also come from burmas vital 
foreign aid donors 
given all thats happened its silly to write the opposition 
off but overall i think the army is sitting squarely on top of the 
people for at least the next few weeks said a western diplomat 
in bangkok 
the recent chaotic events amounted to the largest 
antigovernment movement in the past 26 years of autocratic rule 
and the most intense and widespread display of people power 
since the burmese fight for independence from great britain 
but the ruling oligarchy of military men around ne win despite 
earlier rumors that they were about to flee the country dug in 
maneuvered with what some analysts say was machiavellian 
brilliance and at the very least temporarily won the day 
as the drama unfolded burma experts offered a number of 
possible scenarios including one that called for the military to 
shoot as many protestors as necessary to retain power 
this is the option it chose together with what one western 
ambassador in rangoon described as a devilish plot of stoking 
chaos and anxiety among masses who grew increasingly short of food 
fuel and other necessities 
the people have been beaten over the head for two months they 
never got weapons and they were never really organized and the 
army never cracked said american burma scholar josef silverstein 
although the government has promised general elections a key 
opposition leader former defense minister tin oo told the 
associated press all the opposition leaders are now facing 
arrest and other punitive measures so what can i say the 
situation is so undemocratic 
opponents appear to have little maneuvering room their major 
weapon a general strike that began aug 8 was blunted when civil 
servants and factory workers threatened by dismissal returned to 
their jobs oct 3 
rather than a single united opposition at least four 
antigovernment parties have emerged while the more radical 
students who spearheaded the demonstrations are fleeing to the 
thaiburmese border to get guerrilla training from ethnic minority 
rebels 
by contrast the conservative party has the benefit of big 
coffers a nationwide network built up over 26 years and a body of 
loyalists who stand to lose sizable perks should the opposition 
win despite efforts to officially divorce the national unity party 
from the government analysts agree it is a major instrument of the 
militarybacked leadership 
prior to the current upheavals the party then known as the 
burma program socialist party claimed that more than 14 million 
out of burmas 38 million people were members of either the party 
or its affiliates 
silverstein and others say the leaderships weak spot is the 
shattered economy and dependence on foreign aid to mount a revival 
japan which supplies about 80 percent of foreign loans and 
grants and other donors have frozen assistance but whether tokyo 
choses to use its considerable clout to shape events inside burma 
remains uncertain 
this is a lever the military has to cope with if anything can 
now leverage the situation its going to be the need for outside 
assistance silverstein said

a federal judge has sealed a jurys verdict in a 
15 million damage suit against the ku klux klan while he 
considers a city council members decision to withdraw as the chief 
plaintiff 
in a rambling explanation to us district judge charles a moye 
jr longtime civil rights activist and city councilman hosea l 
williams said wednesday he had lost sleep worrying about the 
bluecollar defendants who have nothing but their homes their 
cars and their paychecks i could not disrupt their families 
the suit seeks 1 million in punitive damages against two kkk 
groups as corporations alabama lawyer morris dees also asked the 
jury to return heavy individual damages 200000 against david 
holland grand dragon of the southern white knights and 100000 
each against daniel carver georgia grand dragon of the invisible 
empire the groups former grand dragon edward stephens and 
marion franklin shirley a veteran of several white supremacist 
groups and an associate of hollands 
but state rep billy mckinney datlanta who joined the lawsuit 
in july objected to williams attempt to halt the trial resulting 
in a hectic day of legal maneuvering while jurors were deliberating 
a verdict 
the suit charged that leaders of the klan groups conspired to 
disrupt a jan 17 1987 brotherhood march by civil rights 
activists in forsyth county and violate the marchers civil rights 
participants in the march were pelted with rocks bottles and 
other debris thrown from people who were among a large group of 
counterdemonstrators who gathered in the virtually allwhite county 
north of atlanta 
a week later more than 20000 people descended upon forsyth 
county in a huge civil rights march that drew national attention 
moye ordered that the verdict delivered to the courtroom 
shortly before 5 pm be sealed in an envelope he dismissed the 
six jurors with orders that they not discuss their verdict with 
anyone he did not tell them why their verdict was sealed 
moye ordered a hearing today with dees who brought the lawsuit 
on behalf of williams mckinney and 55 other marchers pelted with 
rocks and bottles and attorneys for the two kkk organizations 
their leaders and other defendants 
moye did not discuss the subject of the hearing but defense 
attorneys told the court they will file motions to reopen the trial 
in order to question williams and mckinney 
the jury which included one black member began its 
deliberations at wednesday morning 
williams said he was torn by conscience as a believer in 
redemption and forgiving your enemies saying jesus christ 
and the late martin luther king jr would approve 
defense attorney sam dickson said it was a noble chivalrous 
and christian gesture

president miguel de la madrid says there are 
slight and tenuous signs that the industrialized countries are 
beginning to understand the problem of the debt owed them by 
developing nations 
the question is whether that understanding will lead to 
solutions to the problem the outgoing president said in an 
interview with the associated press 
de la madrid also said that mexico will respond to the stronger 
showing by opposition parties in july 6 general elections and 
become a more democratic country 
de la madrid 54 leaves office dec 1 his institutional 
revolutionary party has governed mexico since 1929 and will 
continue to do so under presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari 
de la madrid has been a leader in demanding better debt payment 
conditions for the third world but at the same time has maintained 
mexicos commitment to pay 
mexico has renegotiated its debt and made service payments of 
more than 75 billion in the past six years that de la madrid has 
been president but the principal is 104 billion a few billion 
more than when de la madrid took office 
pointing to mexico as an example de la madrid said debtor 
nations must set our house in order internally with economic 
measures and demand at the same time a fair and realistic deal 
from creditors 
he said some world leaders and banks now realize that the debt 
affects the entire world economy 
mexico insists on joint responsibility of debtor and creditor 
for the debt he said 
he said the institutional revolutionary party must modernize 
while retaining its principles but become more efficient in 
working with the grassroots membership 
however the opposition leftist and rightist parties also must 
realize the times they live in and update their ideology change 
tactics and present articulate programs to the people he said 
he said the relative strengthening of the opposition is a 
small price to pay for the strengthening of political pluralism 
political reforms de la madrid initiated led to greater 
opposition representation in congress 
relaxed and smiling easily during the interview de la madrid 
recalled that when he took office the country had just 100 million 
in reserves citizens were disenchanted with a political system 
which though stable was fraught with corruption 
the world oil price collapse had shattered mexican dreams of 
abundance of citizens told two years earlier that they were on 
their way to prosperity 
there is general agreement that the stocky unpretentious 
president who dealt out strong economic medicine held together a 
country on the verge of social conflict six years ago 
the most serious problem at the time was the lack of 
confidence of mexicans in themselves and the conflict between 
social groups my concern was to maintain peace and individual 
freedoms while trying to obtain a social consensus he said 
de la madrid enacted measures that eliminated many subsidies 
prices went up and salaries lost more than half their buying power 
he was accused of favoring the elite 
through the pri dominance of labor unions he kept protests down 
and eventually got labor government and private business to agree 
on a wage and price control plan that reduced inflation to an 
estimated 50 percent for this year down from 1592 percent in 1987 
de la madrid brought mexico into the general agreement on trade 
and tariffs opening mexicos markets and forcing its manufacturers 
to compete 
the manufacturing industrys exports in 1972 paid for only 26 
percent of its imports in 1987 they paid for 98 percent of the 
imports 
international dollar reserves climbed to 15 billion this year 
as nonoil exports made up for the large drop in petroleum income 
i am satisfied that some progress was made de la madrid 
said but he acknowledged things will not be easy for salinas de 
gortari

ptl founder jim bakker says hes digging 
in for a long battle to reclaim the television ministry and that 
hes not deterred by a canadian businessman who has signed a 
contract to buy ptls assets 
bakker whose own proposal to buy back the television ministry 
fell through said many obstacles remain for stephen mernick of 
toronto who wants to purchase the ministrys assets for 115 
million 
i look towards the long haul im not in this for a short 
term maybe itll be another year before we restore ptl maybe it 
will be two years said bakker who left in march 1987 amid a 
sexandmoney scandal 
ptls courtappointed trustee mc red benton announced 
tuesday he had signed a contract with mernick benton had 
identified other potential buyers but had not previously gone to 
the contract stage 
ptl has been in bankruptcy reorganization since june 1987 and 
must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible under an 
order from us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds reynolds must 
approve any sale and is expected to hold a hearing in about a 
month on mernicks bid 
there are so many obstacles that no way could i even think 
about all of the ramifications of all this until i hear the final 
gavel of the judge bakker said wednesday 
its not over till its over as ive been saying he said 
in front of the new jim and tammy information office about two 
miles south of the christian theme park heritage usa it seems 
every few weeks we go through its been sold again and sold 
again he said referring to other deals that collapsed 
attorney joseph kluttz representing mernick said mernick will 
pay 50 million at closing for the deal and pay the 65 million 
balance over five years 
mernick an orthodox jew has not said what he plans to do with 
ptl or heritage usa but that he would consider retaining its 
christian theme 
benton has said other bidders may still present offers directly 
to the bankruptcy court but he said his recommendation gives 
mernicks offer a strong upper hand 
bakker had proposed a 172 million plan to buy the ministrys 
assets but his bid lost credibility last month when he could not 
come up with a 3 million downpayment 
bakker said he was skeptical about mernicks chances of making 
ptl profitable again 
theres a thousandroom hotel there i dont know how theyre 
going to fill it i dont know how anyone without national 
telelvison experience could fill it he said

about 40 mustangs have found a new home 
at a 4300acre wild horse sanctuary on the rugged south dakota 
range 
were going to do our best to make this a success for years to 
come said bob burford director of the us bureau of land 
management which sponsored the sanctuary and its dedication 
wednesday 
the horses joined about 150 others already running free on the 
sanctuary in an isolated southern black hills canyon 
the mustangs were rounded up by the federal government from 
public lands across the southwestern united states the wild horses 
in some areas were in danger of starving to death because natural 
food sources no longer existed 
the horses also were a nuisance to private landowners some have 
been found slaughtered in nevada 
nevada gov dick bryan earlier this week pledged full state 
support to help federal officials in their investigation of the 
rifle killings of nearly 300 wild horses 
all the shootings occurred in remote central nevada within a 
40mile stretch north of austin an isolated nevada town on us 
50 federal investigators said the horses died over a sixmonth 
period 
but at the sanctuary in south dakota state officials said they 
think the wild horses will be a popular tourist attraction 
particularly during the states centennial next year when attention 
is focused on south dakotas frontier and western heritage 
the driving force behind the sanctuary was dayton hyde a 
lifelong rancher and the founder of the institute of range and the 
american mustang 
theyre having fun hyde said they spend a lot of their 
time just running they take off like school children 
hyde said he hopes to develop a wild horse museum at the 
sanctuary featuring films about horses and a history of the horse 
in the wests development 
i want a front porch from which you can see the horse herd 
along the cheyenne river he said this is some of the most 
beautiful country in the west not enough people get to see it

the heated vice presidential debate exchange over dan quayles 
invocation of john f kennedy is drawing strong partisan reaction 
with democrats denouncing the audacity of the indiana senator 
and backers of the republican ticket accusing lloyd bentsen of a 
cheap shot 
politicians followed party lines in their reaction to wednesday 
nights confrontation between the handpicked candidates for vice 
president 
backers of democrat michael dukakis declared bentsen a landslide 
winner while supporters of republican george bush were equally 
effusive about quayles performance 
democratic gov mario cuomo of new york said today that quayle 
looked like johnny carson playing karnac he started with the 
answers and looked for the questions so when you judge the top of 
the ticket judge them by the people they select 
on the other side republican gov john sununu of new hampshire 
said that both quayle and bentsen showed they can serve as 
president if necessary but that the focus would now return to 
dukakis and bush as much as the democrats are trying to suggest 
that michael dukakis is not going to serve if elected he is 
sununu said 
both commented on nbcs today 
debate coaches gave the edge to bentsen with one calling the 
kennedy exchange the point that turned the clash in the texans 
favor 
melissa maxcy wade the director of forensics at emory 
university and a member of a panel of experts who judged the debate 
for the associated press said i thought quayle really held his 
own until we got to the john kennedy question it was like a father 
putting down a child i thought the momentum turned then 
the dramatic highlight of the 90minute debate occurred at the 
midpoint when quayle said his qualifications for high office were 
equal to those of kennedy when he was elected president in 1960 
like kennedy quayle has served eight years in the senate 
senator youre no jack kennedy bentsen snapped 
that was really uncalled for quayle retorted 
replied bentsen youre the one that was making the 
comparison senator and i did not think the comparison was well 
taken 
dan quayle has the audacity to compare himself to john 
kennedy said buie seawell chairman of the colorado democratic 
party you saw lloyd bentsen throw a right cross that dropped him 
to the canvas 
i think it was a cheap shot republican sen alan simpson of 
wyoming said of the bentsen jibe that was very unbecoming of 
lloyd bentsen 
arne carlson minnesota state auditor and the states highest 
ranking gop official praised both debaters 
bentsen is obviously mature well informed he said 
quayle came across as quite bright alert i think he did an 
excellent job of dispelling concern people had over his candidacy 
carlson said bentsen made a terrible mistake with the jab on 
john kennedy i think most people thought that was unnecessary and 
quite rude 
it threw a chill over the whole debate a sour note said 
atlantabased pollster claibourne darden it changed from then 
on the way you looked at lloyd bentsen 
california pollster mervyn field also used the manboy analogy 
to describe the kennedy exchange 
bentsen came through as the man and quayle came through as the 
boy he said 
geraldine ferraro whose family was subjected to intense 
investigation after her democratic vice presidential nomination 
four years ago laughingly disagreed with quayles contention that 
he was the mostinvestigated candidate in history 
hes young but hes not that young hes got to remember 
1984 she said today on abcs good morning america 
field said he thought bentsen did so well people might wish he 
were at the top of the democratic ticket rather than dukakis 
it may be a mixed blessing to the democratic ticket he said 
darden took a similar view saying bentsen makes michael 
dukakis look weak 
merle black a political scientist at the university of north 
carolina said i think bentsen did a better job i think the 
dukakis ticket ought to be helped by his performance 
but he also praised quayle who he said performed well enough 
that the bush campaign will not have to engage in extensive damage 
control after tonight but i think he was outdebated by bentsen 
nancy neuman president of the league of women voters called 
the debate a draw 
i dont see that one outshone the other particularly she 
said i think they came off pretty well as they intended whether 
the voters won im still trying to figure out

new yorkers already accustomed to subway ads for 
hemorrhoid ointments roach killers and aids prevention will see a 
graphic ad opposing aid to el salvador that had been rejected here 
and elsewhere as inflammatory 
the advertisement shows a photograph of a dead man lying in a 
pool of blood on a salvadoran street what are your tax dollars 
buying in el salvador it asks 
the company that controls subway ad contracts for the city had 
rejected it last spring on the grounds that it was inflammatory 
and offensive 
the ad finally went up in every fourth subway car this week 
after the organization behind it threatened legal action and the 
metropolitan transportation authority decided the ad did not 
violate its standards of good taste 
the ad is sponsored by winning democracy in el salvador a 
washington dcbased coalition of organizations that opposes us 
aid to el salvador 
all told producing and renting the space for the new york ad is 
costing winning democracy about 20000 said mike delia a new 
york spokesman for the group 
the coalition is placing similar ads in buses and subways 
throughout the country in san francisco the ads are due in a 
month or two in washington they will be going up this week they 
are up already in boston 
the company that arranges ad contracts for los angeles buses 
has so far refused to accept the ads said carol waymire who 
represents the winning democracy in el salvador campaign in los 
angeles 
in new york an april rejection letter from the private firm 
that handles subway ad contracts for the mta stated that the ad was 
inflammatory and could encourage vandalism by riders who 
might be tempted to tear it down 
in another letter the new york subways advertising firm cited a 
provision in its contract with the city under which ads may be 
rejected if they are deemed offensive to good taste 
but they have all sorts of offensive things advertised in the 
subway cockroach ads ads about aids about abortion about 
incest delia said 
we think thats great that they put these other signs up but 
we were totally befuddled that we couldnt put our signs up 
at no cost to winning democracy edward copeland a lawyer who 
specializes in civil liberties agreed to challenge the rejection 
of the ad as a violation of the constitutional right to freedom of 
expression 
the first amendment applies to public forums and the subways 
in new york are public forums he said the winning democracy 
people have a right to express their viewpoints and to reach out to 
their fellow citizens 
the conflict was resolved without a lawsuit after copeland 
contacted the mta 
when we reviewed it we didnt find it to be objectionable 
said mta spokesman tito davila we have the final say on these 
things 
davila said the subway ad firm is supposed to submit any 
rejected advertisement to the mta for final review but failed to 
do so in this case 
bill apfelbaum president of the firm did not return phone 
calls by the associated press seeking comment 
as compensation for the delay in accepting the ad it will run 
for two months for the price of one copeland said 
were hoping the ad will get the public debating again about 
whats happening in el salvador said delia were trying to 
expose the policy of us government support for what we consider a 
brutal military dictatorship 
the united states has sent nearly 3 billion in military and 
economic aid to el salvador during the last eight years according 
to the state department the reagan administration says the aid has 
resulted in democratic and economic reforms 
but opponents say the aid has bolstered military control of the 
country and that humanrights abuses and killings by death squads 
are rampant 
the ads designed by internationally renowned artist john 
baldessari supply a phone number that readers can call for more 
information 
the ads in english and spanish will reach an estimated 45 
million new yorkers said delia

philippine and us officials said 
today they have narrowed differences over us military bases here 
and are nearing agreement on their status through 1991 
president corazon aquino and us undersecretary of state 
michael armacost gave the assessment after a 45minute meeting 
which the us official described as a very good talk 
filipino and american panels began talks last april on the 
status of clark air base the subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations but the talks have stalled over compensation and 
other issues 
armacost told reporters after the meeting that foreign secretary 
raul manglapus and assistant secretary of state gaston sigur met 
wednesday in new york on the bases talks 
progress is being made and the hope was there for an early 
agreement he said 
in a statement to filipino reporters later mrs aquino said she 
received a call from manglapus today and that he sounded very 
optimistic and confident 
the united states maintains the bases under a 1947 agreement 
that expires in 1991 the current talks are to determine 
compensation and other issues through the final two years of the 
agreement 
after that any extension must be approved by twothirds of the 
23member senate where opposition to the bases is strong mrs 
aquino refuses to say whether she will support an extension 
also today leaders of a new party backing aquino pushed through 
a plan to reorganize the house of representatives but agreed to 
maintain an alliance with other coalition members 
the move would give the party the struggle of the democratic 
filipino clear control of the house as the majority party and 
force other rival but nonopposition parties to accept their 
minority status politicians said 
after a closeddoor meeting of proaquino legislators house 
speaker ramon mitra announced that a majority voted to reorganize 
house committees and that at least five chairmen had tendered 
courtesy resignations 
he said party leaders would continue meeting to decide on a 
system of apportioning chairmanships of the houses 43 committees 
the reorganization was expected to be completed next week he said 
creation of the party triggered so much realignment within the 
coalition that the new group wound up the biggest 
proadministration party with 158 of the 203 seats in the house it 
has seven seats in the 23member senate

mixed feelings about contraceptives among 
catholic women could explain why a study found their abortion rate 
is 30 percent higher than that of protestant women said the 
president of a private reproductive health foundation 
religion appears to play some role in the abortion decision 
but not in the expected direction wrote jeannie rosoff 
president of the alan guttmacher institute which conducted the 
study 
the findings emerged from two separate national surveys 
conducted by the new yorkbased institute in 1987 and 1988 
the groups which have the most ambivalence about the use of 
contraceptives probably dont use contraceptives as well as other 
groups in the population said the study released wednesday 
contraception as well as abortion is forbidden by the roman 
catholic church 
nearly onethird of all women who choose abortion report a 
fear of others discovering that they had become pregnant the 
study said catholic women are more likely than those of other 
denominations to choose abortion for this reason 
the abortion rate among catholic women is also higher than that 
among jewish women it said 
women who describe themselves as bornagain or evangelical 
christians were half as likely as other women to have abortions 
the study said 
the study arrived at its conclusions by comparing the number of 
women of each religion among abortion patients to the number of 
women of that religion in the general public 
according to the study nearly three of every 100 american women 
aged 15 to 44 had an abortion last year a figure that remained 
constant for a decade 
the abortion rate among hispanic women was 43 per 100 while 
the rate among nonhispanic white women was 23 per 100 nonwhite 
women most of whom were black had an abortion rate of 53 per 100 
women who said they were roman catholics had an abortion rate 
that was about the same as the american average of 3 per 100 the 
rates among women who described themselves as protestant or jewish 
were 30 percent below the national average 
it is not clear how the effects of religious affiliation are 
influenced by other socioeconomic factors or for that matter by 
differences in the use of contraception which affect the need to 
make a decision about abortion rosoff added 
about half of the women having abortions became pregnant because 
their contraceptive method failed or because they used it 
incorrectly 
in both surveys the researchers noted that women increasingly 
must work outside the home for economic reasons and that to do so 
they must have an adequate education 
both of these aims can be threatened by an accidental 
pregnancy not only among young unmarried women but also among 
older married women the study said 
one study surveyed 1900 women nationwide who had abortions in 
30 facilities the other queried nearly 10000 women who obtained 
abortions during 1987 at 103 clinics hospitals and doctors 
offices in all regions of the country 
susan tew a spokeswoman for the institute said the margin of 
error was not available

syndicated columnist carl t rowan said his 
inconclusive trial on weaponspossession charges which have been 
dropped did not alter his views on gun control 
i never said i wouldnt use whatever was at hand to repel an 
invader rowan said wednesday after district of columbia 
authorities announced they were dropping the charges i did it in 
that case and i would do it again 
rowan had been charged with using an unregistered handgun and 
ammunition in shooting a teenager who took an unauthorized dip in 
his pool last june a twoday trial led to a hung jury 
rowan who has used his columns to speak out in favor of gun 
control told a news conference in kansas city mo he still 
supported enacting a federal law that makes it extremely 
difficult for anyone but a lawenforcement officer to have a gun 
he added i have never said that i would not own a gun or 
that i wont in the future 
the teenager who was shot ben smith of suburban chevy chase 
md told the montgomery journal in a telephone interview from 
boston that he doesnt understand the districts reasoning 
i guess its the district of columbia coming through again 
smith said 
from the start i thought that if anyone tried to kill 
somebody that they should be charged with assault smith said 
its all politics 
a district of columbia superior court jury that heard the 
weapons charges against rowan became deadlocked in deliberations 
last thursday and a mistrial was declared 
frederick d cooke the district of columbia corporation 
counsel said the city decided not to seek a new trial 
while i continue to believe that mr rowan in fact and in 
law committed the offenses for which he was prosecuted the 
districts ability to obtain a fair hearing in this matter has been 
undermined cooke said 
i dont believe either mr rowan or the government in this 
case can get a unanimous verdict 
rowan said the gun he fired was given to him by his son carl jr 
the son testified during the twoday trial that he had 
repeatedly been rebuffed in his efforts to register the 22 caliber 
pistol with city police officials in 1982 and 1983 
rowan jr who was an fbi agent at the time he asked about 
registration requirements testified that officers in the police 
departments gun control unit told him he was exempt from 
registration requirements because he was a law enforcement officer 
rowan jr also claimed that the same officers told him it would 
be no problem if others in his family had access to the weapon

studied medicine at american university in beirut and received his 
medical degree from the university of geneva in 1933 he and two 
other doctors went to shanghai to study tropical medicine hatem 
lived in china for the rest of his life 
all around me were poverty malnutrition and exploitation

china were more fatal to the poor than illness the problem was not 
only medical but political 
hatem said in 1984 that he first read karl marxs communist 
manifesto in shanghai its impact on me was immediate i thought 
then and think now that the poorer you are the more easily you

with a goal of eradicating the disease which still afflicts about 
70000 chinese by the year 2000 
his death had not yet been reported in the tightly controlled

politburo vadim medvedev said some of gorbachevs reforms have 
fostered abuses but in general he showed himself a closer ally of 
the soviet leader than his predecessor as ideology chief yegor k 
ligachev 
some western diplomatic analysists had predicted medvedev seen 
as a reform economist would be charged with redefining socialism 
to incorporate gorbachevs pragmatic approach to rebuilding the 
soviet economy 
his remarks published wednesday in the newspapers pravda and 
izvestia appeared to begin that process but he took a cautious 
first step 
unfortunately there have been some irresponsible attempts to 
cast a shadow over lenins inheritance over the basic values of 
socialism medvedev said 
and how else can those statements appearing in the press be 
interpreted that claim that the commandadministrative system 
resulted from lenin those attempts to deny the socialist nature of 
our system that even doubt the rightness of our choice for 
socialism 
medvedev 59 a political economist by training was named to 
the communist party politburo on friday by the partys 
policymaking central committee and was named to head a newly 
created commission on ideology 
he spoke tuesday to an international conference in moscow on the 
problems of contemporary socialism 
in his reported remarks medvedev showed himself more open to 
following the western example to help solve soviet problems than 
was ligachev the politburo member reputed to be a conservative 
opponent of gorbachev 
but some soviets who read medvedevs speech in the national 
press said it was impossible to conclude that the newest politburo 
member had completely embraced gorbachevs reform agenda 
the partys new ideology chief spoke of the need for deep 
qualitative rejuvenation in socialism and said the solution to 
some soviet problems could come from other socialist countries and 
even from the west 
while the socialist perspective is being worked out the 
experience of humanity as a whole cannot be ignored including the 
nonsocialist part of the world medvedev said 
im referring not only to the scientific and technical 
achievements of the system that is opposed to us but to many forms 
of organization of public life of the economic process 
medvedev also urged a rethinking of the role of central planning 
and the market and voiced support for two pillars of gorbachevs 
program for perestroika or nationwide restructuring leasing 
farmland to individual farmers and spreading economic cooperatives 
to provide consumer goods that are lacking in the state sector 
ligachev in an aug 5 speech said the class struggle 
determines international relations but medvedev hewed more closely 
to gorbachevs line which maintains that in the nuclear age east 
and west must cooperate to solve common problems 
the conception is outdated that socialism and capitalism can 
develop in a parallel way medvedev said on the contrary 
their ways will inevitably intersect both systems will inevitably 
interact within the framework of the same human civilization

dose of prescription drugs has undergone sterilization in hopes of 
receiving a lenient sentence her attorney says 
melody s baldwin 29 was sterilized tuesday at wishard 
memorial hospital said michael j donahoe 
the primary factor in fashioning the sentence for anyone is 
the likelihood of repeat behavior donahoe said wednesday i

lenient if she underwent the procedure

italian politicians rose to their feet in parliament today and 
applauded the news that chile rejected gen augusto pinochets bid 
to extend his presidency until 1997 
the reaction was similar in britain spain and france where 
lawmakers hailed the decision by voters to reject pinochet in 
wednesdays national referendum open elections are to be held next 
year for the first time since 1970 
in athens spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said greeces socialist 
government was pleased about the advance of the democratic 
opposition and will salute with complete satisfaction their 
final predominance 
britains foreign office said the government was encouraged 
we hope that the plebiscite result which appears to reflect 
the will of the chilean people will represent an important first 
step on the path back towards full democracy a statement said 
the west german government called on chiles military leaders to 
abide by terms for the nations democratization 
we hope that the government will now hold to its own promised 
timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free 
elections said government spokesman herbert schmuelling 
italian premier ciriaco de mita a christian democrat said 
the government over which i am presiding pledges to be near the 
chilean people in the difficult struggle for the conquest of 
democracy 
foreign minister giulio andreotti also a christian democrat 
said in a statement that the victory of the opposition is very 
important the historic tradition of chile is democratic 
italy was the scene of numerous demonstrations when pinochet 
seized power in a 1973 coup that ousted president salvador allende 
a marxist through the years many chileans have taken exile in 
italy 
in britain george foulkes a foreign affairs spokesman for the 
opposition labor party was among 500 foreigners called to chile by 
opposition groups there to act as election observers 
its a tremendous triumph for democracy in chile a totally 
unique situation where a dictator has been voted out in a 
plebiscite foulkes said 
it is absolutely crucial now to ensure that pinochet fully 
accepts the decision of the chilean people he said 
jacques arnold a lawmaker in the governing conservative party 
and secretary of the house of commons latin american group noted 
that pinochet was not without support 
the most important thing is that despite all the cards against 
him particularly on human rights this old man of 72 achieved a 
considerable vote he said 
all spanish political parties represented in parliament hailed 
the referendums outcome 
the triumph of the no vote represents the rejection by the 
majority of a dictatorial regime and the process that the regime 
designed to perpetuate its hold on power a statement from the 
governing spanish socialist party said 
spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said the 
people of chile have given a great lesson of political maturity 
pierre mauroy first secretary of the french socialist party and 
a former premier called the vote an immense victory after 15 
years of dictatorship and suffering 
laurent fabius speaker of the french national assembly said on 
french radio the result was a great day for chile 
its a country which suffered terribly for 15 years and 
now all of a sudden there is light and hope again he said 
in brussels belgium an official of the european economic 
community commission said the referendum result showed that in 
chile and elsewhere man triumphs as he fights for liberty and the 
respect of his fundamental rights 
claude cheysson the eecs commissioner for northsouth matter 
also urged chilean authorities to restore democracy as quickly as

congress is nearing approval of a proposal 
that finally may overcome strong political opposition and save 
millions of dollars by closing unneeded military bases 
theres no question the issue of closing bases is very 
difficult politically said rep les aspin dwis chairman of 
the house armed services committee closed bases mean lost jobs 
and nobody in congress likes to lose jobs 
this is a oneshot proposition said sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee youve got an 
opportunity to do this because were changing administrations and 
theres a sense this could be done fairly now 
nunn and aspin spoke late wednesday shortly after house and 
senate negotiators agreed on the complicated details of a bill that 
could mean the first major base closings since 1977 
final floor approval by the house and senate is likely later 
this week aspin and nunn agreed 
the bill could mean that up to 25 of the nations 550 largest 
bases could be shut down starting in 1990 aspin said nunn 
declined to estimate a number saying i dont know what theyll 
come up with 
the measure creates a 12member commission which would have 
until dec 31 to send defense secretary frank c carlucci a 
recommended list of bases he would have to either accept or reject 
the entire list by jan 15 only five days before the reagan 
administration leaves office 
a 10member commission has been at work for five months 
preparing its findings the two new members would be added to that 
panel 
if congress objects to the list it could only block the 
closings by house and senate approval next spring of a bill killing 
the plan but that bill could be vetoed by the new president 
its much better for an outgoing administration an outgoing 
secretary of defense to take that responsibility nunn said 
hes going to make a lot of enemies politically we have a 
person now who is willig to take that heat 
pentagon officials have estimated that between 2 billion and 5 
billion a year could be saved if they are allowed to close outdated 
bases 
but aspin disputed that figure the 5 billion estimate is 
financial hyperbole he said predicting savings of several 
hundred million dollars a year 
nunn declined to estimate i think the savings may be very 
significant but i dont know yet what the figures will be 
military bases mean jobs and since 1977 congress has enacted a 
stiff complex series of laws which effectively have blocked the 
pentagon from closing any of the 3800 military installations in 
the contintental united states including the 550 larger bases 
those laws would be waived by the current proposal 
until 1977 the pentagon generally had been allowed to have its 
way on base closings particularly in the years after world war ii 
when the nations large military machine was being mothballed 
between 1961 and 1977 the defense department closed 3600 
installations 
the change came after the air force proposed closing loring air 
force base in northern maine that states congressional delegation 
blocked the plan by by winning approval of legislation requiring 
long and costly environmental studies an action followed later by 
other legislators 
the current commission is headed by former rep jack edwards 
rala and former sen abraham ribicoff dconn 
politically they have a very difficult job and they have to 
be astute aspin said the list they come up with has to be 
politically balanced it cant have too many from one area of the 
country like the south or the west and too few from another area 
and it has to be perceived as being equally divided in terms of 
hurting democratic and republicans in congress

a lawyer says he will try to prevent a 
genetic test that could determine whether his clients 9yearold 
daughter was switched at birth and is actually the child of a 
pennsylvania couple 
a hearing is scheduled for friday at which the couple ernest 
and regina twigg of langhorne pa plan to ask a judge to order

three doctors and a nurse alleging fraud and negligence they also 
have said they want to find and regain custody of their biological

lives in sarasota 
ginbsurg said his client is certain he is the biological father 
and intends to keep the girl he has raised and loved for 10 years 
regardless of what a test would show 
a genetic test cant make him feel any more the father 
ginsburg said and i cant see how it will do us any good 
ginsburg said the couple has not presented convincing evidence 
that the twiggs are the true parents and deserve a blood test 
marvin ellin an attorney for the couple said no firm evidence 
is required to bring a court action to determine paternity

foreign minister shimon peres forced his 
way through a hostile crowd today during a campaign tour of an open 
air market where youths taunted the labor party candidate with 
shouts of peres go home 
aides to peres described the confrontation in this town a 
traditional stronghold of the rival rightwing likud bloc as the 
worst of the campaign for the nov 1 parliamentary elections 
security guards subdued one man who tried to throw a tomato at 
peres while scores of youths in blue and white likud shirts shoved 
their way toward peres 
the protesters also shouted begin begin the name of the 
former likud prime minister menachem begin and mocked peres 
moderate policies toward arabs with cries of arafat plo 
in a speech later to a more sympathetic audience of elderly 
people in a shopping plaza peres stressed that labors peace 
strategy was aimed at avoiding a demographic problem with arabs 
we are 35 million jews in israel and there are 24 million 
arabs in territory controlled by israel peres said if likud 
succeeds and annexes the territories we are going to have an arab 
majority it is the likud then that will make a palestinian state 
on wednesday the likud leader prime minister yitzhak shamir 
vowed that if he is reelected israel will not withdraw from the 
occupied territories or allow an independent palestinian state 
shamir spoke in a working class suburb of tel aviv and accused 
labor of pursuing a dangerous policy leading to pressure on us to 
abandon every achievement the israeli nation made in the six day 
war including united jerusalem 
it was in that war in june 1967 that israel sized the west bank 
and gaza strip and annexed arab east jerusalem 
aides said peres was upset by the pushing and shoving today in 
the ramle market although he showed no signs of it as he walked 
stonyfaced in shirt sleeves through the town of 46000 several 
miles from tel aviv 
it demonstrates a certain style that a better part of the 
israeli people do not like to see peres told the associated 
press 
in jerusalem meanwhile the 40member central elections 
committee rejected a bid by rightwing parties to disqualify a 
leftist jewisharab party claiming its support for dialogue with 
the plo would undermine the jewish state 
on wednesday the board disqualified usborn rightwing 
extremist meir kahane from running in the elections saying his 
calls to expel arabs were racist and illegal kahane is appealing 
the decision to the supreme court 
peres colleague police minister chaim barlev proposed 
wednesday that israel remove troops from certain arab towns to cool 
tensions until a landforpeace compromise could be worked out with 
the palestinians 
the likud bloc opposes yielding any of the arab lands israel 
captured in 1967 on the grounds that territorial concessions would 
endanger security 
the likud also rejects a laborbacked proposal to convene an 
international peace conference including the five permanent members 
of the un security council israel jordan a palestinian 
delegation and egypt 
shamir has said israel would be isolated in a hostile forum and 
forced to give up the occupied territories 
since the arab uprising began dec 8 more than 280 palestinians 
have been killed in the west bank and gaza strip six israelis also 
have died

officials see no sign that other 
american hostages in lebanon may be freed in the wake of a 
captives release earlier this week a us state department 
official said 
the official who came to this city with a state department team 
to debrief the freed hostage also said wednesday the reagan 
administration assumes the kidnappers are financed by iran 
doctors here said freed hostage mithileshwar singh a

was in good spirits but they said he faces tremendous stress as a 
result of his 20month ordeal

of nine americans missing in lebanon 
after arriving in damascus singh said three american educators 
abducted with him and remaining in captivity were ok 
armed men dressed as policemen took singh hostage jan 24 1987 
on the beirut university college campus in moslem west beirut 
along with americans alann steen robert polhill and jesse turner 
all four taught at the school 
a group calling itself islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine claimed responsibility and said it freed singh as a 
goodwill gesture

still held in lebanon held longest is terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was abducted 
march 16 1985

really dont know said the official 
there are no indications that others are coming out said

a spokesman for the commission now sponsoring 
the second presidential debate says it is seeking a new location 
because the league of women voters held the original debate site in 
los angeles hostage 
bob neuman director of media arrangements for the commission on 
presidential debates said wednesday the league of women voters was 
demanding 90000 in payments before releasing the shrine 
auditorium in los angeles 
neuman said the commission still wants the second and final 
debate between george bush and michael dukakis to be held in los 
angeles 
but the league on wednesday moved to secure the hall by placing 
a 40000 deposit on it two days after the group announced it was 
backing out as sponsor of the debate in a dispute over control of 
format and staging details he said 
neuman said the league was demanding repayment of the deposit 
plus 50000 reimbursement for expenses before releasing the hall 
to the bipartisan commission for the debate to be held oct 13 or 
oct 14 depending on the length of the major league baseball 
playoffs 
what theyre telling us is theyre willing to spend 40000 to 
keep the hall empty neuman in omaha for the vice presidential 
debate said 
we consider that holding the hall hostage he said were 
not going to deal with them 
in washington league spokeswoman stephanie drea said neumans 
allegations were absurd and an unfortunate ploy to try to 
embarrass the league 
she said the nonprofit league was not holding the shrine 
auditorium hostage but was merely seeking reimbursement for the 
40000 deposit and costs of preparing the hall for the debate 
including broadcast equipment and fire safety precautions 
she said the commitment for the deposit was made long before the 
league decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the event 
we got the ball rolling she said now they can pick it up 
and run with it we should be reimbursed for our very real costs 
that have gone into planning for that debate and no more 
the nationally broadcast debate was to have been sponsored by 
the league of women voters on thursday or friday of next week 
however league officials angered by refusal of the two 
presidential campaigns to give up control of the format and staging 
details withdrew 
commission executive director janet brown in omaha to direct 
commission handling of the vice presidential debate said the 
commission was looking for local donors to pay for putting on the 
second presidential debate she said the first debate in 
winstonsalem nc cost 500000 to stage and the los angeles 
one would cost at least that much 
neuman said he remained optimistic the debate would be held 
despite the dispute over the hall

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle said today he was not worried about a poll showing that many 
television viewers thought he had lost wednesday nights debate 
with democrat lloyd bentsen 
george bush is going to win the election hes still way ahead 
in the polls quayle said as he left a morning rally at his hotel 
an abc poll indicated that many tv viewers believed bentsen had 
trounced the indiana senator but quayle asked if he was concerned 
about the poll said not at all were still ahead 
quayle told supporters at the rally that we now have a little 
more than four weeks left in this campaign 
this election is going to be decided by the american people 
and its going to be decided on the issues quayle said 
he headed for rallies in missouri and florida and a lunch with 
former president ford 
after the debate quayle said the texas senator had absolutely 
no response to the fact that michael dukakis is simply out of step 
with mainstream america 
leaving the debate wednesday night the indiana senator beamed 
at reporters and pronounced his own performance great 
he insisted that he was pleased at having been grilled 
repeatedly by the panelists about his qualifications for national 
office 
we were delighted that they brought it up three different 
times because it gave us three different times to talk to the 
american people about what ill do for the country quayle said 
the republican vice presidential nominee received congratulatory 
calls after the debate from vice president george bush president 
reagan and senate republican leader bob dole 
bush told his running mate you did great said quayle 
spokesman david prosperi 
at a postdebate outdoor rally wednesday night quayle told 
2000 flagwaving supporters that bentsen had a difficult time 
defending the liberal governor from massachusetts 
there was absolutely no response to the fact that michael 
dukakis is simply out of step with mainstream america quayle 
said 
referring to wednesdays american league playoff game in which 
the oakland athletics beat the boston red sox 21 quayle said 
this afternoon the team from massachusetts lost and tonight 
the man from massachusetts lost 
i feel great quayle said 
but despite strong statements of victory by quayle and his 
advisers early indications were that many people had doubts his 
performance an abc poll of 637 viewers gave the round to bentsen 
by 51 percent to 27 percent with a 45 percent margin of error 
in particular quayle seemed to suffer during an exchange with 
bentsen on quayles oftstated defense of his youth and 
qualifications quayle 41 said he had just as much experience in 
congress as john f kennedy did when at 43 he ran for president 
senator youre no jack kennedy bentsen said 
quayle told reporters outside the rally wednesday night that 
bentsens comments were uncalled for a charge he had made 
during the debate aides went further calling it a cheap shot 
late wednesday the campaign released a statement of bentsen 
distortions and errors on the kennedy question the statement 
said quayle never said he was jfk he simply compared his age and 
level of experience in response to a question 
prosperi quayles spokesman said the senator would be able to 
put the kennedy question and those about his qualifications 
behind him 
well focus the attention on dukakis and on the fact that 
lloyd bentsen couldnt defend his running mate prosperi said 
despite the heated exchange between the two nominees prosperi 
noted that it had been quayle who went over to bentsen and 
initiated the closing handshake before bentsen even left the 
podium 
it just shows hes a bigger man than bentsen prosperi said

michael dukakis said today his running mates 
debate performance was a real plus for us and he laid claim to 
momentum in the final weeks of the presidential race 
the democratic nominee said lloyd bentsen was knowledgeable 
and relaxed during the wednesday night encounter while republican 
dan quayle was programmed beyond belief dukakis characterized 
quayle as extremely insecure and lacking in strength 
confidence or anything 
this will be a real plus for us dukakis told reporters as 
he flew to texas to join bentsen at a rally 
before he left boston dukakis campaign distributed a 
blistering analysis of quayles performance saying whenever 
senator quayle deviated from his wellmemorized script his answers 
were shallow revealing his lack of substantive knowledge he 
appeared uninformed and a stranger to basic facts on almost every 
issue 
the statement noted that quayle was asked several times what he 
would do if suddenly thrust into the presidency and it said that 
in every response he failed 
dukakis took time after the wednesday night debate between 
bentsen and indiana sen dan quayle to join supporters and deliver 
his assessment of the vice presidential showdown which he watched 
at home 
the most important qualification for a vice president is that 
hes ready at a moments notice to assume the presidency of the 
united states dukakis told supporters waving american and texas 
flags tonight lloyd bentsen demonstrated that he was the only 
one on that stage whos ready 
dukakis said he spoke to the texas senator after the debate 
i couldnt be prouder of him as my running mate the 
massachusetts governor said hes going to be a great vice 
president 
dukakis joined aides in claiming their man trounced quayle 
particularly in demonstrating a grasp of the issues and showing 
presidential confidence and leadership 
what you saw was his strength his maturity his vision his 
toughness his leadership all of the qualities that are so 
important in a vice president and so important in a president so 
important to someone who is a heartbeat away from the presidency 
dukakis said hes a great asset to our ticket 
the democratic nominee also said the debate offered the voters a 
chance to learn about how i make presidential decisions and the 
way george bush makes presidential decisions my friends tonight 
that was no contest 
dukakis said the bentsenquayle debate and his recent debate 
with bush had helped focus the campaign on the real concerns of 
mainstream americans that boded well for democrats he said 
what is now beginning to happen is that with the american 
people focused in on these two tickets and on their concerns about 
the future they understand that this is a nation that is never 
satisfied with the status quo and never will be the reason we are 
the greatest nation in the world is that we are always moving 
forward always trying to do better always trying to build a 
better future 
dukakis then prompted a thunderous ovation by declaring and 
thats why were going to win 
later he got the flags waving again by saying on the 20th of 
january 1989 the new era of greatness arrives 
dukakis was back on the stump today after spending most of 
wednesday catching up on gubernatorial business 
he took a break in the early afternoon to meet with reporters 
denouncing bushs criticism of a massachusetts furlough program 
while dodging a question likely to come up during a friday visit to 
north carolina whether he would have like president reagan 
vetoed legislation to protect the us textile industry from 
foreign competition 
bush has made his criticism of a massachusetts furlough program 
a staple of his campaign and has a new television ad accusing 
dukakis of running a revolving door prison system at the 
center of bushs attacks is a case in which an inmate on furlough 
raped a maryland woman and assaulted her fiance 
the vice presidents record on crime and the fight against 
drugs is pathetic dukakis said its been a failure and in my 
judgment this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic 
occurrence for political reasons the vice president knows that the 
federal government has a very extensive furlough program knows 
that governor reagan in california in the 70s had a very extensive 
furlough program and tragedies as a result of that 
as for the textile bill which would have placed strict new 
limits on imports of textiles apparel and shoes dukakis said he 
favored legislation giving five years protection to the industry 
provided it agreed to modernize there was no such provision in the 
bill vetoed by reagan but dukakis said there would have been if he 
was president 
dukakis refused to answer directly when asked whether he would 
have signed the legislation as it was presented to reagan 
dukakis also took to the airwaves with another round of ads 
four 30second spots attacking bush and his record on drug 
enforcement education the environment and social security

democrat lloyd bentsen heading to texas for 
a reunion with michael dukakis pointed cheerfully today to polls 
showing he won the debate with republican dan quayle and said 
gee those polls were great werent they 
bentsen stopping to speak with reporters as he left his hotel 
this morning also said he had been angered by quayles reference 
to john f kennedy which triggered the sharpest exchange of their 
debate 
the texas senator and democratic vice presidential nominee 
disputed any suggestion that he had appeared nasty in his response 
to quayle over the kennedy remark 
what happened there was quayle kept comparing himself to 
kennedy and he overreached himself and i got fed up with it 
bentsen said 
he pointed out that kennedy was a war hero and had run a 
nationwide campaign before being nominated president asked if he 
was angered he said sure as a friend of jack kennedy i deeply 
resented his trying to put kennedys mantle over himself when he 
didnt have a record that compared with kennedy 
an associated press panel of veteran debate judges called 
bentsen the winner by a wide margin and an instant abc news poll 
also gave the victory to the democratic nominee 
gee those polls were great werent they i was just 
delighted bentsen said 
i knew i was scoring points and i thought i was winning but 
its difficult to be objective about yourself 
i had fun the nominee said after his 90minute televised 
encounter with his republican rival i think we made our points 
bentsens principle point of the evening was his stinging retort 
to quayles assertion that he has as much experience in congress as 
kennedy had when he sought the presidency 
senator you are no jack kennedy bentsen shot back at the 
41yearold junior senator from indiana whose credentials have been 
challenged since bush selected him for the ticket 
that was really uncalled for senator responded quayle 
bentsen took a congratulatory phone call from dukakis before 
leaving omaha civic auditorium after the debate then spoke to 700 
cheering supporters in a crowded hotel ballroom just down the 
street 
he made no mention of his remark on kennedy which was the 
rhetorical and emotional high point of the contest but he derided 
quayle for his handling of the repeated questioning he took on his 
qualifications and what he would do if the presidency was thrust 
upon him and he depicted quayle as sticking close to his 
advisers coaching 
you know i stood up there for 90 minutes listening to senator 
quayle say what he was going to do if he was president of the 
united states and i still didnt know bentsen said 
finally i realized that all he was going to do was go back to 
that script again 
bentsen was making his first stop today at the lone star steel 
co near longview in east texas dukakis who watched the debate 
back home in boston was flying down to join him for the one 
appearance they were going their separate ways from there 
bentsen added to the democratic ticket amid hopes of carrying 
giant texas was campaigning later in dallas and planned to stump 
the state again friday and saturday as polls showed the democratic 
ticket trailing the republicans in texas by as many as 10 
percentage points 
as he left the debate site bentsen declined reporters shouted 
invitations to declare himself the winner i think i did fine 
and i enjoyed it he said 
at the rally he stood before a banner that read and the winner 
is bentsen he appealed to democrats in the farm states of 
nebraska and just across the missouri river iowa saying that 
quayle doesnt even know what theyre talking about when farm 
target prices are discussed 
after days of intensive debate preparation bentsen tried to 
relax wednesday afternoon before the debate the 67yearold 
senator displayed exhuberance in a predebate check of the 
auditorium stage lifting his wife ba and carrying her off the 
stage 
bentsens debate jab at quayle over his kennedy comparison was 
the object of much of the postdebate analysis or spinning as 
the partisan commentaries from both parties are called 
his democratic senate colleagues chortled over the tense 
exchange 
i thought that was the knockout blow of the evening said 
california sen alan cranson 
it was a devastating reply said louisiana sen bennett 
johnston 
but republcan sen alan simpson of wyoming sounded wounded 
saying i think it was a cheap shot that was not the lloyd 
bentsen i know

the communist leadership of the 
northern province of vojvodina said today it will resign the 
announcement came after 50000 people rallied to demand the ouster 
of the politicians in a deepening economic crisis 
milovan sogorov president of the communist party central 
committee of vojvodina made the announcement in belgrade at an 
emergency session of the communist party of serbia which controls 
the autonomous northern province the official tanjug news agency 
reported 
the central committee was to implement the resignations at an 
emergency meeting this evening in this provincial capital about 40 
miles north of belgrade state television reported 
the resignation could pave the way for wholesale changes in the 
national communist party leadership and in the parties of 
yugoslavias six constituent republics 
angry crowds in novi sad chanted we want resignations as 
they gathered in front of the communist party central committee 
headquarters 
the state news agency tanjug estimated the crowds at 100000 
but an associated press reporter at the scene estimated about 
50000 people were on the streets at midafternoon 
the protesters tried to force their way into the party 
headquarters but cordons of police including a riot unit blocked 
their way 
the crowds then moved to a larger square loudspeakers broadcast 
shouted slogans about yugoslavias growing problems which includes 
217 percent inflation a 15 percent unemployment rate and a 21 
billion foreign debt 
the flagwaving demonstrators chanted police go away we 
are going to smash windows and we want freedom and demanded 
the immediate resignation of the provincial communist leadership 
according to the witnesses 
communist officials who spoke were booed and jeered by the 
crowd and television showed one hit with a bottle 
most factories and businesses in the city remained closed 
the serbian communist party issued a statement after its 
emergency meeting saying the political situation in vojvodina was 
deteriorating rapidly according to tanjug

people 
the demonstrations in novi sad began about noon wednesday and 
continued into the night 
protesters also chanted in favor of serbian communist party

their anger over the economic situation 
in central serbia about 140000 serbs participated in two other 
rallies wednesday to press demands for greater serbian control over 
kosovo and vojvodina 
the novi sad protesters who support milosevics position were 
spurred by a decision taken by the central committe of vojvodina to 
reprimand two members who supported his views at an earlier rally 
tanjug said the head of yugoslavias communist party stipe suvar 
said tuesday that the partys 162member central committee probably 
will vote oct 17 for a shakeup in the leadership of the ruling

mounting for their failures to resolve the economic problems and to

a cabinetlevel program to combat street gangs 
bushs stuck to the text of his toughoncrime speech before 
texas supporters and made no mention of running mate dan quayles 
debate wednesday night with democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen 
but later while jogging at a quartermile track with students 
at texas christian university the vice president said he felt as 
good as i did last night which is very very good 
bush said quayle answered the questions he was knowledgeable 
he did an outstanding job and the american people know it and 
nobodys going to be able to even our spin merchants or the 
dukakis spin merchants cant change the facts 
immediately after the nationally broadcast 90minute debate in 
omaha neb the gop nominee congratulated quayle for a superb 
job 
speaking to a gathering of texas law enforcement officials 
sponsored by the dallasfort worth crime commission bush said he 
would seek 250 million annually for the next four years to 
incarcerate the hardened felons and rising number of drug 
offenders 
he also said he would use assets seized from drug traffickers to 
help finance new prison construction 
expanding on a proposal that he unveiled wednesday bush that as 
president he would create a unit within the justice departments 
criminal division that would be devoted solely to mobilizing 
government resources in a battle against violenceprone street 
gangs 
bush adviser debrah steelman said the proposal would cost about 
50 million and would involve administrative efforts to 
coordinate and fully utilize existing resources at the federal 
state and local levels 
bush said he believes in rehabilitation to some extent 
especially for firsttime offenders 
but lets face it some criminals are just plain bad theyre 
not going to be rehabilitated theyre not going to reform he 
said 
youre not going to solve the crime problem as some would by 
talking tough while pursuing the same failed policies of liberal 
leniency bush said 
he accused democratic opponent michael dukakis of having a 
liberal sense that counters the common sense that the death 
penalty is a deterrent 
i say that our society simply cannot afford any more liberal 
experimentation with crime he said 
bush called again for converting obsolete military bases into 
prisons and for 100 new special agents to expand the governments 
repeatoffender program for handling those who commit repeated 
crimes

camera crews to his hotel to say that his running mate came 
through with flying colors under tremendous pressure now 
people can see what ive seen all along he said 
this guy did a superb job he added i couldnt be 
happier

indiana on criticisms of his qualifications was a fair one bush 
replied everythings fair in this business id like to get 
a slow ball like that in the first one its easy 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said that while viewing the 
debate in his hotel suite the gop nominee cheered on quayle with 
such comments as hes doing a fantastic job 
after the debate bush called quayle and told him it was a 
10strike fuller said bush also called president reagan to 
express his delight 
bush then told reporters that the american people saw quayle 
in form in control answering substantive questions in a 
substantive way and strong 
asked about bentsens performance bush said im not going to 
criticize the other guy 
earlier in the day bush unveiled a 39 billion invest in our 
children package that encompassed educational health antigang 
and antitoxic proposals that bush said would combine to improve 
educational opportunity for children

and infants at up to 185 percent of the poverty level

a woman suffering from tuberculosis who 
repeatedly refused treatment was arrested by authorities who 
suspect she spread the disease to family members and acquaintances 
the woman margaret allen 29 was taken wednesday to montabello 
rehabilitation center in baltimore for treatment 
elin gursky director of epidemiology and disease control for 
the prince georges county health department said allen was 
arrested by sheriffs deputies under a littleused provision of 
maryland law that requires public health officials to control the 
spread of contagious diseases 
tuberculosis which causes coughing night sweats and profound 
weight loss can be cured but can cause death if not treated 
gursky said 
health officials cannot force allen to receive treatment for the 
disease but they can incarcerate her to prevent its spread gursky 
said allen was described as being in a highly infectious stage of 
the disease and if she leaves the hospital gursky said she can 
be jailed 
health officials repeatedly tried to persuade allen to be 
treated for the disease and then obtained a court order in a civil 
proceeding before seeking a criminal warrant for her arrest gursky 
said several members of her family have tested positive for 
tuberculosis and are expected to receive treatment 
i dont want people to think we go around arresting people who 
have communicable diseases because we dont gursky said this 
was an extreme case 
tuberculosis is caused by an airborne strain of bacteria that 
can be transmitted by sharing a close space with an infected 
person she said

democrat lloyd bentsen exuberantly pointed 
today to polls suggesting hed won his debate with republican dan 
quayle while quayle focused on running mate george bush declaring 
him still way ahead in the presidential race 
bush did not mention the debate as he gave an anticrime speech 
today in fort worth texas afterward when asked about wednesday 
nights encounter he said quayle did an outstanding job and the 
american people know it 
the democratic standardbearer michael dukakis pronounced the 
debate a real plus for us he said today that quayle was 
programmed beyond belief while bentsen was knowledgeable and 
relaxed 
bentsen heading to texas where he was to join dukakis noted 
that a flash abc news poll had found viewers declaring him the 
winner by 51 percent to 27 percent that the same survey had shown 
a gain of three percentage points for dukakis in the presidential 
race putting him and bush in a virtual tie and that a panel of 
debate judges who scored the debate for the associated press had 
unanimously said bentsen won 
gee those polls were great werent they i was just 
delighted he said 
quayle who spoke to reporters as he left a rally at his hotel 
in omaha said he was unconcerned about the polling george bush 
is going to win the election hes still way ahead in the polls 
quayle said 
in washington president reagan accused bentsen of having taken 
a cheap shot against quayle when bentsen retorted during the 
debate that youre no jack kennedy after quayle compared his 
own experience with that of the late president john f kennedy 
bentsen asked today about that exchange in the debate said 
what happened there was quayle kept comparing himself to kennedy 
and he overreached himself and i got fed up with it 
the texas senator said kennedy was a war hero and had run a 
nationwide campaign before being nominated for the presidency he 
said of quayle sure as friend of jack kennedy i deeply resented 
his trying to put kennedys mantle over himself when he didnt have 
a record that compared with kennedy 
democrats hoped the debate had dramatized their contention that 
quayle was too inexperienced to step into the presidency on a 
moments notice 
in a 90minute meeting where neither candidate made any big 
mistakes the most electric moment came when the boyishlooking 
41yearold quayle was defending his qualifications and said he had 
as much experience as kennedy had had when he sought the 
presidency it was a comparison he has made often 
bentsen shot back senator i served with jack kennedy i knew 
jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no 
jack kennedy 
with an icy stare quayle interrupted to say that was really 
uncalled for senator bentsen replied you are the one that 
was making the comparison senator and im the one who knew him 
well 
 
after the debate dukakis seized on the question of competence 
telling a boston rally the most important qualification for the 
vice president is that hes ready at a moments notice to assume 
the presidency of the united states tonight lloyd bentsen 
demonstrated that he was the only one on that stage whos ready 
in fort worth texas vice president bush said quayle hit a 
home run right from the start of the debate and wasnt fazed by 
the questions about his fitness 
bush said that quayle under tremendous pressure came 
through with flying colors now people can see what ive seen all 
along 
with just 33 days remaining before the election bentsen was 
teaming up with dukakis today at a rally in longview texas quayle 
was heading for stops in missouri florida and tenneesse while 
bush campaigned separately in texas and arkansas 
the third and final debate of the campaign will be held late 
next week in los angeles when dukakis and bush square off for the 
second and last time 
in a presidential race that is virtually a tossup at this point 
polls indicate that quayle is costing bush support with many 
voters uneasy about his readiness for high office 
it was the first question put to quayle on wednesday night and 
he replied i have more experience than others that have sought 
the office of vice president he said that on national security 
and arms control education and jobs and the deficit i have more 
experience than does the governor of massachusetts 
the 67yearold bentsen was never challenged on his 
qualifications but he pointed out that he had served in combat 
was a businessman and a farmer as well as a senator 
what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the 
breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this 
kind of a task bentsen said 
bentsen accused the republicans of attempting to slash social 
security and said quayle voted eight times to cut benefits quayle 
accused him of distorting the record and said the democrats were 
trying to scare the older people of this country 
bentsen said the reagan administration had appointed 
environmental officials who were the equivalent of bonnie and 
clyde quayle said dukakis had allowed a major environmental 
problem to fester in boston harbor 
bentsen assailed quayle on his record on veterans issues he 
said his rival had sponsored legislation to tax the combat pay and 
disability pay for people who are lying in the hospital quayle 
did not reply to the charge 
quayle criticized bentsen the chairman of the taxwriting 
senate finance committee for setting up a breakfast club for 
lobbyists willing to pay 10000 in campaign contributions im 
sure they werent paying to have cornflakes quayle said 
bentsen said there was nothing illegal in what he did but said 
the breakfast club was a doozy of a mistake he said quayle has 
collected over a quarter of a million dollars in honoraria 
much of it from special interest groups and that quayle could 
spend the money on golf club dues if he wants 
an abc news poll conducted immediately after the debate found 
bentsen the winner over quayle 51 percent to 27 percent the 637 
voters polled favored bush over dukakis by a margin of 50 percent 
to 45 percent before the debate and by a margin of 50 percent to 
48 afterward the margin of error was 45 percent 
all six debate judges who scored the contest for the associated 
press picked bentsen as the winner by an overall margin of 148125 
a perfect score was 180

president reagan today accused democrat lloyd 
bentsen of a cheap shot unbecoming a senator of the united 
states for criticizing republican dan quayle for comparing 
himself with john f kennedy 
reagan posing for pictures with president moussa traore of 
mali was asked by a reporter whether quayle would be damaged by 
being compared with the late president 
no i think that remark was a cheap shot and unbecoming a 
senator of the united states the president said 
another reporter asked if quayle hadnt led with his chin in 
comparing himself with kennedy during his vice presidential debate 
with bentsen in omaha neb on wednesday 
no the only comparison he was making was that he is being 
attacked i think unfairly on the basis of his age and his 
experience in government and he was pointing out that john 
kennedy who sought the highest office and won it had actually 
less experience in government than he has and they were the same 
age reagan replied 
as white house aides ushered reporters out of the oval office 
reagan called them back and said he did not believe that quayle was 
trying in any way to downgrade sen kennedy 
quayle 41 sparked one of the sharpest exchanges of the debate 
when he said he had as much government experience as kennedy then 
a senator from massachusetts when kennedy ran for president in 
1960 
bentsen 67 replied i served with jack kennedy i knew jack 
kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no jack 
kennedy 
quayle shot back that was really uncalled for senator 
bentsen replied that it was quayle who had made the comparison in 
the first place

defended his takeover of the school on feb 2 by saying the us 
constitution gives him the right to bear arms 
i didnt kidnap anybody the unemployed tuscaloosa resident 
told jurors i went there to exercise my constitutional rights 
the government is doing things to destroy the future of our 
country 
harvey has said he took over the school to call attention to the 
homeless and hungry in america his trial was moved to huntsville 
because of publicity in tuscaloosa 
he began his defense after district attorney charles freeman 
told the jury that children and teachers were in stark cold 
terror for endless hours during the incident 
the 110 counts involve 104 students five teachers and john 
rhodes jr a man harvey is accused of duping into helping seize 
the school rhodes was initially charged in the takeover but 
authorities later said he was an unwilling participant 
all the students teachers and rhodes plus officers and the 
schools headmaster dan carden are among the 137 people 
subpoenaed to testify at the trial which circuit judge john m 
karrh said probably will last from five to seven days 
also summoned was gov guy hunt who is to testify friday about 
a bogus pardon he videotaped that led harvey to surrender 12 hours 
after he entered the elementary school armed with a highcaliber 
rifle two loaded automatic pistols and 2000 rounds of ammunition 
plus two unloaded guns he handed to rhodes as they entered the 
school 
i have a constitutional right to bear arms harvey said i 
went there to prove my right to bear arms i didnt mean to 
hurt anyone 
in a rambling discourse he told the jury that politicians dont 
tell the truth that people are poisoning water and air that 
were selling our childrens futures with the national debt 
during the siege he said he told officers who tried to 
dissuade him that this is not a criminal act it is a political 
act 
in fact harvey said because the school was surrounded by 
officers i felt like a hostage it could have ended in five 
hours they put me through psychological warfare 
assistant prosecutor thomas smith told jurors that a firstgrade 
class went from 830 am when harvey entered the school until 
146 pm with no food no restroom no water no nothing 
during the siege smith said harvey always had children 
around him so he wouldnt get shot he was using them as shields as 
well as hostages he is certainly guilty of all counts of 
kidnapping 
if convicted on all counts harvey could be sentenced to more 
than 10000 years in prison

the defense department has formally changed 
its plans for the first phase of a star wars antimissile defensive 
system slashing the cost estimate for a rudimentary system from 
115 billion to 69 billion the pentagon announced today 
this is a startling change top pentagon officials told a 
joint hearing of the house and senate armed services committees 
but the lowered cost is the result of changes in the program 
said robert costello undersecretary of defense for acquisition 
air force lt gen james abrahamson director of the star wars 
program and gen robert herres vice chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff 
the pentagons defense acquisition board had completed an annual 
review of the program on tuesday and approved a series of 
restructuring moves they told the panels 
the changes are designed to keep the research moving forward 
while addressing concerns that it would cost too much to begin 
deploying a system on the ground and in space the pentagon said 
the restructuring absolutely does not mean the 
administration is pulling back from its original goal of developing 
a hightech defensive system that could shield the united states 
from nuclear missiles the pentagon added 
the program as now modified will still continue to emphasize 
research on space defense to provide for early deployment of 
spacebased sensor systems to maintain the option to develop a 
limited protection system given a future national decision and the 
funding to do so and to provide for a balance between near and 
longerterm weapons technology programs the statement said 
the lowered projections surprised some legislators sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate panel said he viewed the 
numbers with some skepticism 
nunn said costs on other weapons have dropped while the weapons 
were on the drawing boards but then rose once the programs entered 
the construction phase 
abrahamson denied that the programs goals have changed and a 
defense of us population centers is still the aim 
the goals have not changed he told sen pete wilson 
rcalif in answer to a question 
the star wars program known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons 
that could be deployed in space and on the ground to automatically 
shoot down soviet nuclear missiles congress has repeatedly refused 
in recent years to fund the program at the pace sought by president 
reagan but nonetheless has allowed the research to continue 
last june when it became clear congress was going to slash more 
than 700 million from the presidents fiscal 1989 request of 49 
billion defense secretary frank c carlucci ordered the entire 
program restructured it was those modifications in turn which 
were reviewed tuesday by the defense acquisition board the 
pentagons highest level weapons review panel 
according to tuesdays announcement the huge reduction in the 
estimated cost of a firstphase system was achieved primarily by 
scaling back plans for spacebased interceptor rockets known as 
sbis 
the pentagon now believes it can develop a more capable 
seeker guidance unit for the rocket improving its chances of 
hitting a target and thus reducing the number that would have to be 
fired in a war 
this together with shifting more of the burden to the 
lowercost groundbased rocket interceptors which was 
increased in inventory by about 70 percent enabled us to cut the 
size of the sbi constellation in half the pentagon said 
the department declined to say specifically how many sbi 
interceptors it planned to put in space for the modified phase one 
system saying the number was classified 
but there would be fewer than 200 carrier vehicles with 
several sbis aboard each carrier the pentagon said 
the department said it also had achieved the cost savings by 
reducing the sophistication of a planned surveillance and tracking 
satellite system 
the various modifications will not have any effect on estimates 
that it will take several years yet for researchers to determine 
even that a phase one system is workable the pentagon said 
the decision to deploy a strategic defense system will be made 
by future national leaders in the early to mid 1990s contingent 
upon adequate funding levels the pentagon said

president mikhail s gorbachev will hold a summit 
with chinese leaders early next year a kremlin diplomat said today 
igor a rogachev a deputy foreign minister who is the soviets 
point man in contacts with the chinese was asked at a news 
conference whether a sovietchinese summit will follow a meeting 
this year between the two countries foreign ministers 
he also was asked whether the summit would occur in the first 
half of next year as news reports from shanghai have indicated 
my sense is that one might be in a position to suggest that 
both would be the case rogachev replied 
relations have been strained between the two communist giants 
since the 1960s and the last chinese summit was held in 1959 
between nikita s khrushchev and mao tsetung 
gorbachev who is also the soviet communist party chief has 
made several overtures to china to remove obstacles to improving 
relations he has ordered a pullout of soviet troops from 
afghanistan reduced soviet troops on the border with china and 
agreed in august to the first direct talks with the chinese about 
the vietnamese occupation of cambodia 
chinese foreign minister qian quichen met with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze in new york last month and quian 
is to travel to moscow later this year no date has been set 
rogachev said the cambodia conflict in which the soviet union 
supports vietnams occupation will be high on the agenda for the 
moscow talks 
rogachev who represented the kremlin in the talks with the 
chinese on cambodia did not say whether gorbachev would travel to 
beijing or whether chinese leaders would come to moscow 
gorbachev renewed the idea of a summit with china in a speech in 
the siberian city of krasnoyarsk sept 16

radical students who stormed a government office with iron pipes 
and firebombs and shouted antiamerican and antigovernment slogans

north korea on thursday continued its verbal 
attacks on the olympic games in seoul calling them dictatorial 
and an excuse for suppression of popular protest 
the government in pyongyang also accused the united states of 
using the olympics to keep the korean peninsula divided the games 
which began sept 17 ended sunday

dictatorial olympics induced by the us imperialists and their 
stooges into seoul was rejected by the people the 
governmentrun korean central news agency said 
the report was monitored in tokyo

divide the korean peninsula split into capitalist south and 
communist north since 1945 
the us imperialists two koreas plot has become more 
pronounced nowadays the minju chosun a staterun newspaper

stage terrorist attacks on the south to disrupt the games and set 
up tight security but no incidents occurred

chileans rejected president augusto 
pinochets bid to extend his 15year rule in a referendum that 
cleared the way for democratic elections the military government 
conceded defeat today 
the entire 16member cabinet submitted their resignations early 
today labor minister alfonso marquez de la plata told reporters 
he also said the assistant ministry officials resigned he gave no 
further details 
gen pinochet the army commander gave no statement on the 
results of wednesdays balloting and it was not known whether he 
would accept the resignations or shuffle his cabinet 
thousands of celebrating students marched through santiago 
today and people in downtown buildings showered streets with 
confetti 
with 996 percent of the vote counted 547 percent rejected 
pinochet and 43 percent voted for him in the yes or no 
referendum the interior ministry said at midday 
more than 72 million of chiles 74 million registered voters 
cast the first presidential ballots in 18 years the ministry said 
some waited in lines up to a mile long 
the country delivered its mandate and is on the way to a 
transition to an authentic democracy patricio aylwin leader of 
a 16party opposition coalition told cheering supporters today 
under the constitution pinochet who seized power in a bloody 
1973 coup remains in power until 1990 if he had won the 
referendum he would have served until 1997 
interior minister sergio fernandez pledged to respect the 
results of wednesdays balloting but also to enforce the 1980 
constitution which the political opposition wants changed 
police reported few incidents of violence and traffic was 
normal later in the morning 
leaders of a 16party opposition coalition promised to pursue 
national unity as they seek a speedy return to democratic 
government 
fernandez aylwin president of the centrist christian 
democratic party and roman catholic cardinal francisco fresno 
hailed the peaceful reaction a sign of chileans maturity and civic 
responsibility patricio hales communist party spokesman said the 
party took measures to keep people quiet and prevent disorders 
that could have been used by the government as a pretext for 
repression 
fernandez formally conceded defeat early today after an 
emergency meeting with pinochet the fourman military junta that 
serves as a legislature and the 15member cabinet 
we abide by the results already known to the people 
fernandez said reading from a text 
his expression grave he added that the government reiterates 
its unbreakable resolve to comply with and have others comply 
with the constitution and laws 
the opposition has said it will pursue negotiations with the 
armed forces on changing the constitution pushed through by 
pinochet in 1980 
the document lays out a schedule for a return to democracy 
including a special provision for wednesdays referendum in case 
of a no majority it called for competitive presidential 
elections to be held in december 1989 with the winner assuming 
power in march 1990 
pinochet remains leader until then 
the constitution also calls for elections in 1990 for a 
congress disbanded when pinochet seized power in a september 1973 
coup that ousted president salvador allende a marxist who won the 
last presidential election in 1970 
opposition leaders want the presidential ballot moved up they 
also want to eliminate provisions in the constitution that make 
congress virtually powerless to amend it and that give the armed 
forces both autonomy and supervisory role in national policymaking 
aylwin said in a victory speech we reiterate our proposal to 
reach agreement with the armed forces on the terms of an 
institutional political change that would result in free elections 
quickly and in a congress totally and freely elected 
the military made no immediate comment on the proposal but has 
rejected such calls before 
there were no significant reports of fraud during the voting 
but after polls closed scattered violence was reported by 
authorities including the burning of a public bus by 
antigovernment protesters 
in the often combative southern slum of la victoria hundreds 
sat outside following the returns by radio waving flags and 
setting off firecrackers soldiers did not intervene

the grand jury in the tawana brawley 
case concluded in a report issued today that the black teenager 
apparently concocted her story of abduction and rape by a gang of 
white men 
the 170page report said there was no evidence that any sexual 
assault occurred and it suggested that the girl herself was 
responsible for the fecessmeared condition in which she was found 
after a fourday disappearance 
the sevenmonth investigation went on without the cooperation of 
the 16yearold miss brawley or her family who with their advisers 
accused authorities of engaging in a racially motivated coverup 
attorney general robert abrams said he has filed ethics 
complaints against miss brawleys lawyers alton maddox jr and c 
vernon mason for making every effort to prevent the criminal 
justice system from uncovering the truth of what happened 
abrams accused the advisers of opportunism and hucksterism in 
presenting their personal agenda and added perhaps the 
greatest disservice done by the brawley advisers is the reckless 
manner in which they jeopardized the rights of future victims of 
racial assaults 
miss brawleys advisers bitterly attacked the report 
what should we expect from 21 whites from dutchess county 
mason said on new york city radio station wlib referring to 21 
whites on the panel of 23 it is clear they never intended to 
arrest and prosecute those people who did this to tawana brawley 
another adviser the rev al sharpton said abrams is not 
after people who rape black girls they want to stop anybody 
who will stand up for the rights of black people in this country 
the grand jury heard testimony from more than 180 witnesses and 
received more than 250 exhibits of evidence on the racially charged 
case 
miss brawley was found nov 28 seemingly dazed outside an 
apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in 
wappingers falls 75 miles north of new york city her body was 
smeared with feces and scrawled with racial slurs in charcoal 
she claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by 
the white men and she implicated law enforcement officials in the 
attack 
there is nothing in regard to tawana brawleys appearance on 
nov 28 that is inconsistent with this condition having been 
selfinflicted the grand jury said it said she had spent some 
of the fourday period at her old apartment 
although we have not found any evidence to substantiate her 
allegations we remain concerned about the welfare of this young 
woman the panel said 
abrams would not speculate on why miss brawley may have 
concocted the story 
however the new york times which disclosed the grand jurys 
findings last month reported at the time that the panel had 
evidence suggesting that she made up the story to avoid punishment 
from her mothers boyfriend for late nights out 
the newspaper said the grand jury also heard allegations that 
miss brawley may have been involved with drugs or questionable 
characters 
it said the grand jury found the teenager misled doctors 
social workers reporters and public officials with false and 
fragmentary accounts of the alleged abduction 
no charges were brought against miss brawley the grand jury 
said it found no legally sufficient evidence to charge any person 
with a crime or to establish that a crime occurred 
a grand jury in new york is not permitted to criticize ordinary 
citizens it does not indict 
abrams said the false allegations by brawley led to an 
enormous expenditure of money and time 
miss brawleys lawyers seriously impeded the investigation by 
making false public statements including accusing innocent persons 
of assault rape and murder they told their clients to engage in 
illegal conduct said abrams who went on to detail 19 instances 
of alleged false statements 
gov mario cuomo has agreed to have the state shoulder the cost 
of the investigation which has probably topped 500000 because 
he feels the people of dutchess county have already been hurt 
enough said spokesman gary fryer 
the panel also found there was no evidence of a coverup by law 
enforcement officials 
it specifically cleared dutchess county assistant prosecutor 
steven pagones and harry crist jr a police officer who committed 
suicide shortly after miss brawley was found miss brawleys 
advisers had accused both of involvement 
the grand jury issued recommendations to the legislature for 
legal reforms including a proposal that would allow the relative 
of a dead person to bring a defamation case when the individual is 
falsely accused of a felony 
state supreme court justice angelo j ingrassia released the 
findings at the request of abrams who was named special prosecutor 
in the case by cuomo 
ingrassia praised the thoroughness of the grand jury and said 
the panel reached its conclusions properly really it was beyond 
a reasonable doubt he said 
miss brawleys mother glenda was sentenced to 30 days in jail 
in june for defying a subpoena to testify but she defied arrest by 
living in a church 
the grand jury subpoenaed miss brawley but later rescinded its 
vote when it was clear she would not cooperate according to

four nuns critical of recent 
modernizations such as television and videotaped movies in their 
monastery have barricaded themselves in a wing because they fear 
they will be ejected 
the roman catholic nuns sealed themselves tuesday morning in the 
infirmary of the monastery of the most blessed virgin mary of mt 
carmel and remained there today 
the nuns members of the order of the discalced carmelites said 
monastery officials told them four months ago they would have to 
move because of sharp differences in the way the cloister should be 
run the order is a cloistered group devoted to daily prayer and 
contemplation in solitude 
however paterson bishop frank john rodimer said today the women 
would not be ejected 
the sisters are not being evicted the diocese will continue 
to help these four sisters do what they agreed to do to find a 
monastery where they can live prayerfully and contemplatively he 
said 
the nuns ages 28 to 45 moved food and their belongings into 
the infirmary tied the door shut and have vowed to stay there 
until they receive word from the vatican rodimer said the diocese 
has received vatican approval for its actions 
calls to the vatican embassy in washington for comment were not 
immediately returned 
we entered the monastery for a particular life style and what 
these other liberal nuns did is change these rules sister john 
one of the nuns told the record of hackensack 
none of the nuns could be reached for comment today a reporter 
left a note at the convent gate to be carried up to them 
the nuns told the newspaper that mother teresa the monasterys 
prioress began to modernize life at the monastery after her 
arrival last year they said she introduced television videotaped 
movies music and socializing this created a backlash among the 
more orthodox members of the order they said 
its unnecessary noise constant interruptions too much 
hustle and bustle sister john said this is an allaround 
change a change in the spirit of the monastery 
mother teresa hewitt refused to comment today

about 100 people protested outside a clinic today 
in atlantas third day of antiabortion demonstrations and police 
dragged away at least seven people for climbing barricades outside 
the building 
the protesters were arrested near the feminist womens health 
center police asked them to walk to the vans and when they 
refused they were dragged about 200 feet to the vehicles and taken 
to jail 
the rest of the protesters stood outside the barricades singing 
hymns 
meanwhile protest leaders are claiming continued success in 
their promised siege of atlanta despite dwindling numbers at 
nightly rallies and fewer demonstrations at daytime protests 
on tuesday helmeted police officers stood guard at the feminist 
womens health center as patients inside huddled and employees went 
about their business and protesters outside shouted bible verses 
the clinic is one of seven targeted by operation rescue the new 
yorkbased group staging demonstrations here this week the number 
of demonstrators has dwindled since tuesday when 343 were arrested 
on misdemeanor charges 
fourteen were arrested wednesday said city solicitor raines 
carter said 
three of them were charged with simple assault when a patient 
they tried to bar from feminist womens health center stumbled and 
fell 
protest leaders who dubbed this weeks protests the siege of 
atlanta said they have prevented abortions with their 
demonstrations which include attempting to blockade entrances 
clinic officials disputed that and said aside from some 
rescheduling of appointments business has not been affected 
but a 21yearold patient from rome ga said she was horrified 
by the severity of the protests as she arrived at the clinic 
wednesday 
youve got people throwing themselves on the ground trying to 
trip you up and make you fall peeking under the umbrella and all 
that she said speaking on condition of anonymity 
i was in a lot of pain i could have been hemorrhaging or 
bleeding to death and here they are she said nobody should 
have to go through that kind of terrorism 
on wednesday the center which serves 10 to 50 patients a day 
in a building near downtown braced for a morning protest two 
police officers were stationed at the clinics entrances 
other police officers several on horseback deployed at metal 
curbside barricades employees and prochoice volunteers gripped 
black umbrellas labeled choice as they waited to escort 
patients into the facility 
the demonstrators arrived in midafternoon with drastically 
reduced ranks most demonstrators said they limited their 
activities to praying and singing hymns 
as a patient approached the building surrounded by escorts one 
male demonstrator shouted jesus said suffer little children 
that come unto me dont you hear your baby begging for his 
life 
patients inside shied away from the clinics windows and 
whispered among themselves employees occasionally stepped away 
from their duties to check on the demonstrators and talk with the 
policemen 
center director lynne randall spent most of the day outside 
meeting with police officials and volunteers 
its just really been frantic with all of this going on 
she said its had a big impact on the staff and the patients 
ms randall who was wearing a large button that read i 
survived operation rescue said the demonstrators were acting 
like thugs 
we just want to make sure everything is going well she said 
protesters began the demonstrations here july 19 during the 
democratic national convention 
protest leaders frequently have likened their efforts to civil 
rights demonstrations and say they are following the nonviolent 
teachings of such leaders as the late martin luther king jr 
protesters on tuesday complained that police treated them with 
unnecessary harshness twisting arms and fingers and using 
pressurepoint holds just under the ears to force them into buses 
i think what is happening in atlanta right now is just 
terribly antiamerican said city councilman hosea williams a 
colleague of kings it hurts me so bad that we who were the 
leaders of the movement in the 50s 60s and 70s are now the 
political leaders and we are doing the same things to 
demonstrators that george wallace and bull connor and those did to 
us 
however another king colleague rep john lewis said that 
while there are similarities to methods he employed 20 years ago 
the aims are different 
very rarely did we deliberately try to close down a 
business the georgia democrat said we didnt want to 
interfere with the free flow of commerce

with memories still fresh of a bridge 
collapsing into a rushing creek and killing 10 people gov mario 
cuomo is asking voters to approve the biggest bond issue in new 
york history to repair roads 
the 3 billion bond issue on the ballot nov 8 comes five years 
after voters agreed to cuomos proposal to borrow 125 billion to 
rebuild new york 
with the money from the earlier bond issue due to run out in 
march new york has 1600 miles of highway deemed to be in poor 
condition by its inspectors 660 miles of roads too small to handle 
the traffic and 7400 bridges rated unacceptable 
everybody concedes the need said cuomo i hear no one 
arguing against the absolute necessity of investing billions and 
billions of dollars in our roads and bridges 
a coalition of construction and labor officials supporting the 
bond issue is reminding voters of the april 1987 collapse of the 
new york state thruway bridge over the rushing schoharie creek west 
of albany 
where will you be the next time the worst case happens asks 
one tv commercial 
conservative rural upstate politicians the new york chapter of 
the american automobile association and the new york farm bureau 
are among the opponents of the bond issue 
they agree roads are in disrepair but are pressing for a 
payasyougo system with new york dedicating all highway gasoline 
and automobilerelated taxes and fees to road construction and 
repair 
borrowing begets borrowing said james mcgowan vice 
president of the 18 millionmember state aaa the 83 bond issue 
begat the 88 bond issue then where do we go the next logical 
step is for a 75 billion bond issue in 1992 and then maybe a 15 
billion bond issue in 1995 thats the way were going 
cuomo has told new yorkers that if enough of them dont vote 
yes in november they may face an increase of as much as 20 
cents on new yorks 8centpergallon gasoline tax to pay for 
needed highway work 
aaa officials contend taxes will have to be raised anyway the 
enormous costs of the debt service from the bonds are going to have 
be borne by somebody said mcgowan

in what one official acknowledged was a 
startling change the defense department said thursday it has 
slashed the cost of the first phase of a star wars defensive shield 
from 115 billion to 69 billion and the system could be available 
within a decade 
but sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the figures should be viewed with some 
skepticism because the cost of weapons programs often goes down 
while they are in the planning stages and then rises when 
production starts 
the new figures arise from a restructuring of the strategic 
defense initiative the formal name of president reagans 
5yearold program to develop a hightech shield against attack by 
soviet nuclear missiles 
those changes were approved after defense secretary frank c 
carlucci ordered a review when it became apparent the 
democraticcontrolled congress would cut reagans star wars budget 
request for the fiscal year that began last saturday 
the president sought 48 billion for star wars but congress 
approved 41 billion up from last years 39 billion budget 
the current debate over star wars centers around plans to 
develop a firststage program that could form the basis of a 
wideranging system 
the initial phase is based chiefly on spacebased interceptor 
rockets known as sbis that would be housed in flying garages 
circling the globe ready to be fired at launched soviet missiles 
the large cost reduction is chiefly achieved by scaling back 
plans for the number of interceptor rockets pentagon officials 
told a joint hearing of the senate and house armed services 
committees 
this is a startling change acknowledged robert costello 
undersecretary of defense for acquisition 
wwhile the exact figure is classified the pentagon said there 
would be fewer than 200 carrier vehicles garages with several 
sbis aboard each carrier 
the defense department also said it can develop a better 
guidance unit for the rockets meaning the chances of success for 
each rocket would be increased and thus the number that would have 
to be fired would be reduced 
in addition the sophistication of a planned surveillance and 
tracking satellite system is being reduced leading to another 
savings 
air force lt gen james abrahamson director of the sdi 
program said the decision whether to build a firststage system 
could be made early in the next decade with deployment to begin in 
the late 1990s 
abrahamson also disputed critics who say that the programs 
original goal of protecting us population centers has changed to 
protection of nuclear weapons sites 
the goals have not changed abrahamson said and the program 
is still aimed at building protection for people 
air force gen robert herres vice chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff was more cautious about the program saying one should 
not expect a militarily useful system until after the first phase 
is constructed 
the lowered cost doesnt mean a reduction in the system herres 
said theres no reason to believe theres going to be a 
reduction in capability 
both herres and abrahamson said development of a firstphase sdi 
would mean that the united states would have to withdraw from the 
antiballistic missile treaty the 1972 pact that limits the 
defenses each superpower can build 
congress and the administration have been arguing over how to 
interpret the treaty with reagan seeking a broad view that 
would permit expanded sdi testing and congressional democrats 
backing a narrow view that they say wouldnt damage the pact 
in answer to questions costello said the administration 
shortly before it leaves office next january plans to tell 
congress about future sdi testing plans and how those projects 
would affect the abm treaty 
at some point we have to have a broad interpretation or break 
out of the treaty costello said 
he said the decision is way down the road but sen john 
warner rva said way down the road is too vague 
at that point costello said future testing plans are now under 
development 
the changes announced thursday were approved by the defense 
acqusition board the pentagons highest weapons review panel 
abrahamson complained about congressional budget cuts saying 
they had hurt the program congress has annually reduced the 
proposed sdi budget although granting increases from previous 
years 
because of uncertainty last summer about spending for the 
firstphase sdi project star wars contractors laid off 1600 
employees abrahamson said

the senate today voted 940 to exempt from 
federal income tax us savings bonds that are bought to finance a 
college or vocational education 
this is a simple sensible way to help families save for 
college expenses said sen edward m kennedy dmass sponsor 
of the proposal it sends a loud clear message about our 
priorities 
kennedys provision was attached to a bill that corrects errors 
in the 1986 tax overhaul grants special tax relief to various 
groups of taxpayers and includes tax increases to pay for the 
benefits the bill is one of the few major pieces of legislation 
standing in the way of adjournment of the 100th congress 
kennedys collegeexpenses amendment is similar to one that 
president reagan proposed in the budget that he submitted to 
congress last january 
under the provision a family could avoid tax on any savings 
bonds that are redeemed to pay for postsecondary education of any 
family member 
the full tax exemption would be available to families with 
adjusted gross incomes of up to 60000 a year those with incomes 
between 60000 and 80000 would get a reduced benefit no 
exemption would be allowed those with incomes over 80000 a year 
the change would cost the government an estimated 285 million a 
year by 1984 under kennedys amendment that cost would be paid by 
eliminating the tax exemption now allowed parents for any dependent 
child over the age of 24 who is a fulltime student 
buyers of us savings bonds pay no tax on the interest they 
earn until the bonds are redeemed they already are exempt from 
state and local income taxes

president jose napoleon duarte 
said investigations into the alleged slayings of 10 peasants by 
soldiers were inconclusive and he ordered that the matter be 
studied further 
as duarte spoke with journalists wednesday forensic specialists 
exhumed the bodies of seven of 10 people killed sept 21 in san 
francisco 30 miles east of san salvador 
forensic physician roberto maldonado told reporters after the 
first three bodies were pulled from the mass grave that powder 
burns indicated they were shot from six inches away 
the bodies of three other people killed sept 21 were buried in 
nearby san sebastian and were to be exhumed later 
relatives and neighbors of the seven men and three women slain 
said they were killed by soldiers of the jiboa battalion after most 
of the towns residents were detained on suspicion of collaborating 
with leftist guerrillas 
the army said eight villagers were detained but that they were 
killed when guerrillas ambushed the army unit taking them to a base 
for interrogation 
no soldier was killed in the alleged ambush the army said it 
said two attacking guerrillas were killed 
duarte said he had received four reports on the killings from 
a human rights commission the attorney generals office the armed 
forces and the office of the roman catholic archbishop of san 
salvador 
i am still studying the case but until now none of the 
documents provides sufficient criteria i have asked the attorney 
generals office and the armed forces to deepen their 
investigations duarte said 
leftist rebels have fought a 9yearold civil war against the 
usbacked government 
the army has not been accused of civilian killings on the scale 
of the san francisco killings in four years 
also wednesday about 300 national university students marched 
through downtown san salvador with a coffin containing the body of 
a university security guard slain monday 
the state university in a statement said guard raul santos 
escamilla 34 was shot by two men in a university cafeteria 
this criminal act is part of the government and military 
campaign against the universitys just struggles the communique 
said 
the military considers the national university a stronghold of 
guerrilla supporters 
santos had been detained for three days last year by national 
police on suspicion of guerrilla collaboration he was released for 
lack of evidence

montana has become the 16th state to 
complete its portion of the interstate highway system bridging a 
3mile gap that confounded engineers for nearly 20 years 
officials said 
construction workers last week completed interstate 15 south of 
dillon near the idaho border work on the last gap in montanas 
1200mile 30year 12 billion program began in the 1960s but 
triggered a slow earth slide 
about once a month we went down stood on it and looked wise 
and tried to figure out what the hell to do with this mountain 
said dave johnson state engineering specialty supervisor 
the problem was solved by boring holes and draining away the 
water lubricating the earth slide and construction resumed in the

teenage mothers enrolled in a comprehensive 
program to train them for jobs and help them become better parents 
went on to earn higher salaries than women who did not receive the 
help it was reported thursday 
children of women aided by project redirection also did better 
than the children of the comparison group said researchers who 
followed up on those who participated in the program five years ago 
the program led to more people working and people earning 
more when they were working said judith gueron president of the 
manpower demonstration research corp which managed the project 
project redirection funded by the ford foundation and the us 
department of labor operated from 1980 to 1982 in boston new 
york phoenix and riverside calif and later extended to seven 
other places the foundation said more than 800 teenage mothers 
participated for about a year each 
five years after the program 34 percent of the women who had 
participated in project redirection were employed earning an 
average of 200 a week said ms gueron 
among a comparison group that was not enrolled in the program 
28 perwent of the women were employed five years later and they 
earned an average of 161 a week 
researchers said the projects most dramatic impact was on 
teenagers who were receiving welfare when they enrolled in the 
program 
five years later 34 percent had gotten jobs they earned an 
average of 224 a week 
among the comparison group initially on welfare 24 percent were 
employed five years later they earned an average of 154 a week 
weve known for some time that teen mothers are at great risk 
of longterm welfare dependency ms gueron it is particularly 
helpful to have positive results now that congress and the states 
have shown interest in making teen mothers a priority for 
services 
the program targeted lowincome women 17 years old or younger 
who had a child or were pregnant and who had not completed high 
school they received health care education and help preparing for 
jobs and also learned nutrition family planning parenting skills 
and household budgeting women from the community served as mentors 
for the teens 
the researchers found that the program enhanced the teenagers 
parenting skills their children scored better in vocabulary and 
behavior than did the children of women not enrolled in the program 
to build on the findings of project redirection ms guerons 
company a nonprofit research organization that designs and 
evaluates programs for the disadvantaged is developing another 
program called new chance 
that project is expected to provide education and employment 
services for up to 2000 mothers all high school dropouts on

killed two palestinians suspected of collaborating with israel 
the truce ended a rift that threatened to undermine the nearly 
10monthold palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip 
we must be united despite the differences in our beliefs 
the moslem fundamentalist group hamas said in leaflets distributed 
thursday we are against any kind of split

group and the plobacked unified national leadership of the 
uprising agreed to coordinate general strikes stop street fighting 
between the two groups and end the graffiti war of defamatory 
slogans aimed at each other

recognition of the jewish state 
a palestine liberation organization official in nicosia cyprus 
confirmed that meetings with hamas took place but would not 
elaborate the official spoke on condition of anonymity

children infected with the virus that causes aids 
are running up hospital bills of more than 90000 each often 
because they simply have nowhere else to go studies indicate 
many of these children are in the hospital not because theyre 
sick with aids or with anything else said dr kathi kemper who 
examined cases of children testing positive for evidence of aids 
infection at yalenew haven hospital in connecticut 
but because they test positive nobody wants to take care of 
them at home or in foster care and so theres no place else for 
them to go she said in a telephone interview thursday 
basically theyre in the hospital like a daycare center 
home lives of such babies tend to be chaotic because the mothers 
who transmitted the virus to them usually are intravenous drug 
abusers often sick themselves and possibly in jail researchers 
said 
a significant number of babies who test positive arent even 
infected they simply are carrying aids antibodies they inherited 
from their mothers said ms kemper now with harborview medical 
center in seattle wash 
aids antibodies natural diseasefighting agents produced by a 
persons system in the face of aids infection fade from 
uninfected babies bloodstreams by age 6 months to 15 months she 
said all aids tests in current use detect antibodies to the virus 
rather than the virus itself 
even youngsters who really are sick often are put in the 
hospital or kept there unnecessarily ms kemper said some of 
them easily could be getting treatment on an outpatient basis 
yet potential foster families often fear they might catch aids 
a remote possibility and insurance and medicaid policies are set 
up to reimburse for hospital care more efficiently than for 
outpatient or home care she said 
by sept 26 the federal centers for disease control had 
recorded 1185 cases of aids among children under age 13 of whom 
672 had died medical researchers have estimated that 10000 
children could be infected by 1991 
the study by ms kemper and colleague brian forsyth published 
in fridays journal of the american medical association looked at 
children who had tested positive for aids antibodies at yalenew 
haven hospital through oct 31 1987 
among children eligible for the study 54 percent of their 
hospital days were judged medically unnecessary the study said 
the most common nonmedical reason for hospitalization was lack 
of any other place to send the child it said 
a related study in fridays journal found that hospital stays 
for children infected with the aids virus ranged from 466 per day 
for boarder babies those who simply had nowhere else to go 
to 705 per day for the sickest youngsters 
that study led by james d hegarty of harlem hospital center in 
new york looked at 37 children diagnosed with aids or an 
aidsrelated condition in that hospital from 1981 through 1986 
average lifetime costs were 90347 per child the study 
said one third of the total inpatient days and over 20 percent 
of the cost resulted from social rather than medical factors 
ms kemper called for better education and better reimbursement 
for potential foster parents and modified policies under the 
medicaid program and private insurance plans 
she noted that connecticut waged a fosterparent education 
campaign and boosted reimbursement to 1000 a month for foster 
families helping reduce the rate of unnecessary hospital days from 
64 percent in 1983 and 1984 to 30 percent in 1987 for the children 
studied

a federal judge sharply criticized irancontra 
prosecutors on thursday for charging a former cia station chief in 
the nations capital with committing crimes across the potomac 
river in virginia 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr questioned a proposal 
by independent counsel lawrence e walsh to dismiss all the charges 
against joseph f fernandez so prosecutors could seek a new 
indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby alexandria va 
i dont think its a simple matter of ill dismiss it and let 
you go to virginia and reindict it robinson told laurence 
shtasel an associate independent counsel 
the judge did not indicate how he would rule on walshs request 
which was made in a response to a defense motion to dismiss four of 
the indictments five counts on the ground those alleged offenses 
occurred at cia headquarters in langley va instead of in 
washington 
fernandez who used the pseudonym tomas castillo when he was the 
cias station chief in costa rica is accused of conspiring with 
former national security council aide oliver l north to illegally 
ship arms to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
robinson said he found no basis for dismissing that count since 
the alleged conspiracy took place both in washington and elsewhere 
but the judge sharply questioned the prosecution decision to 
indict fernandez 51 in washington on four counts of making false 
statements in virginia to cia superiors and to a presidential 
commission that investigated the irancontra affair 
robinson also lectured the prosecutors about fairness saying 
there has to be a sense of justice in the process as well as the 
outcome otherwise public confidence in the system is destroyed 
laurence shtasel an associate independent counsel said 
prosecutors had not misled the grand jury about the venue or 
location of the four alleged crimes and had advised the panel 
that fernandez could waive his right to be tried in virginia 
the grand jury included the four virginia charges because they 
were related to the conspiracy shtasel said 
that doesnt give it any right to indict when the venue of the 
case is not here robinson said its the governments 
responsibility to advise the grand jury what it can or cannot do 
under the law 
defense attorney thomas e wilson argued that walsh should be 
barred from bringing the charges anew in virginia saying 
prosecutors were trifling with the process 
they intentionally pursued an indictment where they knew there 
was not even a colorable basis of venue on four of five counts 
wilson said 
the prosecutors in this case are not beleaguered overworked 
assistant us attorneys wilson said walsh assembled the 
prosecutorial equivalent of a roman legion 29 lawyers 33 fbi 
agents 11 irs agents four customs agents 
they are trifling with the process they ought to be stuck 
with the consequences wilson said 
but robinson said he didnt know any basis for dismissing 
the conspiracy charge against fernandez 
the nub of the case is the conspiracy indictment any way you 
look at it everything else is superfluous really the judge told 
shtasel 
but he said allowing walsh to try fernandez in washington on the 
conspiracy count and obtain another indictment in virginia places 
an intolerable burden on a single defendant

a federal trade commission staffer in hot 
water over some politically oriented letters he sent out told a 
house subcommittee thursday that he was just doing what he thought 
was expected 
carter l clews who was fired from the ftc and then reinstated 
pending a formal investigation of his activities admitted sending 
letters to the news media critical of statements made by democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis 
i had simply tried to do my job as i understood it clews 
said 
he told a house energy and commerce subcommittee that the 
letters he sent out had been seen by his superiors at the agencys 
press office before they were dispatched 
anna h davis director of the ftc office of public affairs 
denied that saying that the problem was in a postscript clews 
added to one letter without her knowledge and that other letters 
he sent out were not authorized at all 
the letters were sent to broadcasters and newspapers in an 
effort to counter a statement by dukakis that the ftcs antitrust 
efforts had been a joke 
in the letters clews challenged that statement and offered the 
services of commission members for interviews to discuss the 
agencys activities and dukakis remarks that drew a challenge 
from two commissioners democrat andrew strenio and independent 
mary azcuenaga who questioned whether the letters violated the 
hatch act which bans political activities by federal workers 
clews then left the commission after being given a choice of 
resigning or being fired he testified but he later complained 
that his resignation had come under duress so he was returned to 
the payroll pending an investigation he is currently on 
administrative leave 
mrs davis testified that one letter sent to 800 talk show 
hosts across the nation had been approved by agency officials but 
that clews subsequently added a postscript on his own and got a 
commission intern to sign mrs davis name 
clews told the subcommittee on oversignt and investigation that 
the intern signed the letter because mrs davis had approved it but 
was out of town at the time it had to be printed as for the 
postscript he said he assumed mrs davis was aware of it because 
she was present when the letter was placed in envelopes for mailing 
a second letter questioning dukakis statements was sent to 
several columnists carrying clews signature he contended that 
mrs davis had seen that letter in advance but she denied that and 
testified that clews had sent that out on his own avoiding normal 
clearance procedures 
a third letter offering to respond to dukakis was sent to 
washington news bureau chiefs under mrs davis signature 
clews testified that he had written that letter also and sent it 
to mrs davis who he said signed it in her statement however 
mrs davis said while the signature is very similar to mine i 
did not sign it nor do i know who signed it

april fools day only comes once a year 
so people with a semiannual urge for silliness should welcome dick 
dunns campaign to make oct 6 mad hatter day 
outrageous statements and non sequiturs are the order of the 
day dunn a computer worker at interactive systems wrote in a 
letter to the boulder daily camera newspaper 
in the tradition of such boulder events as kinetic sculptures 
and harmonic convergences mad hatter day named in honor of the 
befuddled fellow in lewis carrolls alices adventures in 
wonderland was born one day in 1986 after dunn spent hours 
hacking away at his keyboard 
dunn 39 said he chose oct 6 because sir john tenniels 
classic illustrations of carrolls stories show the mad hatter in a 
top hat with a slip stuck in the band noting in this style 
106 the slip actually notes a hat order and price but dunn 
decided the corresponding calendar date would be appropriate for 
his holiday 
he concedes the word of the holiday has been slow in spreading 
but he has garnered some support from local officials 
boulder city spokesman david grimm said he was game to 
contribute some silliness 
i do that every day he said

is a student of savage elementary a wild 
child 
parents seeking to a different name for the towns only 
elementary school say the current one gives students an 
undeservedly raucous reputation but those behind a save savage 
effort say they seek to preserve the memory of local entrepreneur 
mw savage 
the name is particularly hard on savage elementary youngsters 
who go on to school elsewhere said school board chairman larry 
carlberg theyre known as the savage kids he said 
but a recent bid to change the name has raised the rankles of 
oldtimers and history buffs in this town of 8000 people with the 
backing of the city council american legion and chamber of 
commerce the save savage effort has gathered 731 signatures 
opposing the change 
ive gone to school there we have two sons that also went to 
school there said carol gutoske whos lived in savage for 40 
years nobody i talked to thought it was detrimental 
the towns name dates to the early 1900s when mw savage 
gained widespread fame for the success of his harnessracing horse 
dan patch he built a horse training farm a racetrack and an 
electric railway in savage gradually reshaping the minnesota river 
towns image 
the towns name was changed from hamilton to savage in his honor 
supporters of the name change said they never meant to create 
such controversy 
our purpose is not to divide the community or anything like 
that said mary eichen president of the parentteacher 
organization its just something we thought would be a good 
idea 
the school board is expected to vote on the matter later this 
month

jackie gleasons reading tastes leaned heavily 
toward offbeat subjects like ufos parapsychology and the occult 
1700 of 3700 volumes in the late comedians collection of books 
dealt with those topics 
the collection has been donated by gleasons widow marilyn to 
the university of miami library the actor best known as the 
blowhard bus driver ralph kramden on televisions the 
honeymooners died last year at age 71 
some of these books are kind of crackpot things like i rode 
in a spaceship um librarian jay kalvan said he went out of 
his way to collect books on the occult he was just personally 
interested in any unexplained phenomenon he didnt just collect 
it he read it 
after cataloging the collection will be available for 
inspection by the public by appointment 
frank rodgers director of um libraries said mrs gleason 
donated the collection in recognition of his longtime association 
with miami gleason did his tv variety show live from miami beach 
for many years 
she wanted them to stay in this community rodgers said 
and were delighted she came to that decision 
gleason friend hank meyer the publicist who lured gleasons 
show to miami beach in the 1950s said the books reflect a 
littleknown side of the comic 
that flamboyant image he had that wasnt jackie meyer 
said he was really very quiet serious and introspective the 
publicist said gleason was a voracious reader who went through 
three or four books a week 
he was a very bright person and he had a photographic 
memory he said he would recall every passage he read thats 
why he never rehearsed scenes from his shows hed read a script 
once and have it memorized

the army has agreed to review the records of 
black world war i heroes following an acknowledgement by defense 
secretary frank carlucci that racial discrimination could well 
have extended to individual decisions leading to the awarding of 
medals a lawmaker said thursday 
rep joseph dioguardi rny made the disclosure in releasing 
letters from carlucci and another pentagon official 
dioguardi and rep mickey leland dtexas have been seeking 
posthumous medals of honor for two black servicemen army sgt 
henry johnson of albany ny who served during world war i and 
navy seaman dorrie miller of waco texas who died in world war ii 
the congressmen introduced legislation last october that would 
have waived the fiveyear statute of limitations governing the 
awarding of medals of honor opening the way for consideration of 
the miller and johnson cases but because of pentagon objections 
the bills stalled in the house armed services committee 
dioguardi and leland along with 102 colleagues wrote to 
carlucci in june and the letter released thursday was the 
secretarys reply 
it is clear that unjust discrimination existed during world 
wars i and ii that could well have extended to individual decisions 
leading to the awarding of medals in recognition of heroic 
actions carlucci wrote 
as you know while there were a number of instances where 
black world war i and world war ii service members were recognized 
by individual awards for heroism none was awarded the medal of 
honor 
some 15 million blacks served in the world wars 
carlucci emphasized that the defense department does not 
support a symbolic award of the medal of honor the nations 
highest military honor he also reiterated the departments 
objections to bills singling out johnson and miller when many 
other individuals might have been equally deserving 
nevertheless i am willing as a result of your expressed 
concern to conduct further research to examine the conditions 
existing in the past concerning award of decorations and medals and 
the extent to which racial discrimination might have been part of 
those conditions the secretary wrote 
dioguardi also released a letter from assistant defense 
secretary grant s green jr who said the army will review the war 
records of blacks who served in world war i and received french 
military honors or the distinguished service cross the armys 
secondhighest honor 
research will be difficult because of the passage of time and 
the destruction of so many records in the fire at the national 
personnel records center in 1973 green wrote 
he estimated that the review which has already begun would 
take in excess of six months 
the army research will cover servicemen from the allblack 92nd 
and 93rd divisions during world war i and will attempt to 
ascertain why sgt henry johnson a member of the 93rd division 
was not recognized by the us army for his actions in combat and 
for wounds received in action green wrote 
the army will also try to identify any black world war i 
soldiers who were recommended for the medal of honor but were 
disapproved or received lesser awards he said 
in a handwritten footnote green said he has asked the navy to 
report back to us on the magnitude of doing something similar for 
wwii 
blacks were denied naval combat duty during world war i making 
such research unnecessary dioguardi said but he said he is trying 
to get the army to do similar research into black soldiers who 
served in world war ii 
johnson who served in france was on sentry duty one night when 
he killed four german soldiers rescued a wounded comrade and 
captured a stockpile of weapons despite being severely wounded 
himself he received the croix de guerre frances highest military 
honor 
miller was serving as a mess steward aboard the uss virginia 
when the ship was attacked at pearl harbor after the captain was 
mortally wounded miller dragged him off deck miller then manned a 
machine gun and shot down two enemy aircraft 
he was awarded the navy cross the services second highest 
honor and was killed when his ship was torpedoed in 1943

the government announced thursday it has 
agreed to israeli demands that officials in israels armsbuying 
office in new york receive limited diplomatic immunity after the 
office was investigated for illegal exports of us military 
technology 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said extension of 
consular privileges to about 50 of the 250 employees in the 
procurement mission and a trade office would probably not be 
retroactive 
us officials said last month that israel had been seeking in 
months of talks the privileges for 47 staff members of its military 
procurement office they said the office has been investigated for 
involvement in two cases of illegal export of american military 
technology 
mrs oakley said she was unsure of the differences between 
consular privileges and full diplomatic immunity but that 
diplomatic immunity is more extensive than the consular status 
other officials said the status provides protection only for 
activities directly connected to a persons official functions not 
for all crimes 
the israeli defense procurement mission and the trade mission 
in new york will be considered as annexes to the israeli consulate 
in new york she said we estimate that approximately 50 
israeli officials will require consular privileges 
most other countries that conduct defense procurement 
activities from offices in the united states do so from within 
their embassies in washington and are therefore covered by 
diplomatic immunities and privileges the spokeswoman said 
members of an egyptian military procurement office in washington 
have been given diplomatic immunity officials said 
an egyptian military officer who worked at the office was 
arrested by us authorities earlier this year in an alleged plot 
to smuggle missile components to egypt but he was freed after 
claiming diplomatic immunity he has returned to egypt 
the justice department in july 1986 reportedly sought to 
investigate eight israelis in new york suspected of the illegal 
export of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs spokesman 
john russell said last may that the department decided against any 
criminal prosecution 
another case last november involved a connecticut company that 
paid fines of 750000 for violating us export laws by smuggling 
equipment and technology to israel for the manufacture of 
chromeplated cannon barrels

the sovietsupported government on 
thursday strongly advocated reconciliation with islamic guerrillas 
after a recent escalation of rocket attacks on the capital 
a concerted effort of all mentalities and from all walks of 
life is urgently needed vice president abdul rahim hatif said in 
an interview during the twohour flight from new delhi to kabul 
government press center staffers said the central committee of 
the peoples democratic party of afghanistan would meet monday to 
discuss important matters including efforts to bring the 
guerrillas into a dialogue with the government 
hatif who said he was not a party member is one of four vice 
presidents named by president najib four months ago in a show of 
broadening the base of his government 
however key positions in the government including the 
presidency are held by the party or by politicians closely 
associated with it 
the guerrillas who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors have steadfastly refused to deal with najibs government 
although the soviet union has withdrawn about half the 115000 
troops deployed in afghanistan in the past five months the soviet 
presence is still heavy in kabul the capital 
but the soviet armor and aircraft have not deterred rocket 
attacks on the city 
on wednesday morning 42 rockets hit kabul in less than three 
hours killing 13 people and wounding 34 according to qurban 
shayrzad the citys deputy police chief 
on sept 28 at least 33 people were killed and more than 130 
wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on kabul in recent 
memory most of the casualties were caused in a single attack at a 
crowded bus stop 
in an interview with western reporters shayrzad blamed all the 
attacks on the guerrillas 
the opinion in the streets however seems less certain 
several kabul civilians speaking on condition of anonymity 
expressed belief that some of the rockets were fired by soviet or 
afghan troops who blamed the guerrillas in an effort to alienate 
support for them 
vice president hatif said he thought a variety of political 
views including those of the guerrillas should be represented in 
the government but he said he could not envision an interim 
government without the peoples democratic government party 
diego cordovez special un envoy for afghan affairs last 
month in new york proposed creation of an interim government 
composed of impartial afghans including those both in the country 
and abroad 
hatif a 63yearold businessman said any government should 
have both public support and the means to defend itself 
referring to cordovezs proposal he asked how would it be 
possible for those people who have no public support to implement 
their decisions how would it be possible for them to come 
between two warring parties 
he called the guerrillas irresponsible people with complicated 
weapons and he accused pakistan and the united states of 
continuing to arm the guerrillas even though the soviet withdrawal 
was half completed 
under terms of an april 14 agreement signed in geneva 
afghanistan and pakistan pledged to stop interfering in each 
others domestic affairs the united states and the soviet union 
signed as guarantors of the accord which calls for all soviet 
troops to leave afghanistan by feb 15 
on thursday kabul police escorted three western reporters to 
homes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day 
the first house was occupied by a soldier mohammad shah who 
said four women and one boy in his family were killed when a rocket 
hit the wall around their home on the north edge of kabul 
at another house in the nearby wazirabad neighborhood four 
girls between the ages of 2 and 9 were killed by a rocket 
according to their uncle mohammad karim karim said he was a 
political officer of the sarandoy a paramilitary police force

the grand federal edifice the centerpiece 
of last years constitution day parade in philadelphia was 
dismantled thursday amid its creators anger at the citys failure 
to find it a permanent home 
the 100000 recreation of a float that first rolled through 
philadelphias streets on july 4 1788 has stood in orphaned 
grandeur among prison buses and police cars on a city parking lot 
for much of the past year 
members of the carpenters company and the architectural 
woodwork institute built the float with the intention that it could 
be displayed as a lasting memorial of the bicentennial of the 
constitution 
but the city which was given the float after the sept 17 
1987 parade hasnt received a proposal for its display by someone 
who could care properly for it officials said 
we really had everyones interest in mind said public 
property commissioner benjamin f ellis jr we didnt have any 
intention of letting the float be destroyed 
for example he said theres no point in placing it in a 
park no one would maintain it and it would be destroyed in two 
years 
edward kobler of the woodwork institute said some proposals 
rejected by city officials would have been suitable they 
couldnt make up their minds what to do with it he said 
a city crane helped workers take apart the 36foottall temple 
bearing the motto in union the fabric stands firm it will be 
stored at a suburban warehouse repaired and eventually its 
creators hope turned over to someone who will display it 
we silly people would like to keep it in philadelphia said 
leon clemmer president of the carpenters company a social 
organization rooted in a powerful 18thcentury craft guild that 
built the original edifice 
topped by a plaster statue of ceres the roman goddess of 
agriculture the float was pulled through rainy streets by eight 
gray draft horses during the 1987 parade 
its troubles however began hours after the parade when ceres 
was toppled by some overhead wires 
crippled it was parked across from the southeast corner of city 
hall 
merchants complained so it was moved to a construction site a 
block away and then to the city parking lot where it stood until 
thursday 
finally with the floats seams splitting and molding rotting 
clemmer asked the city to give it back

the house on thursday passed legislation 
designed to end the united states trusteeship over palau the last 
western pacific island nation still covered by the trusteeships set 
up by the united nations in 1947 
the bill sent to the senate by a 40611 vote would authorize 
the president to enter into a compact of free association with 
palau once the micronesian nation of 14000 people approves the 
plan 
us officials have told congress that palau is a strategically 
important area that could host us military and naval bases if a 
new defense basing agreement cannot be worked out with the 
philippines 
under the proposed compact the united states would gain basing 
rights in palau and would be responsible for defending the islands 
the future of the legislation was uncertain as congress worked 
toward adjournment next week 
a senate energy and natural resources committee aide speaking 
on condition of anonymity said key members of the panel are 
opposed to the plan drafted by the house interior committees 
insular and territorial affairs subcommittee 
the aide said the main problem involves about 40 million in 
assistance to palau proposed by the house in addition to the 460 
million in aid over 15 years that was contained in 1986 legislation 
approving the proposed compact 
senators are taking the position that the 1986 agreement between 
the house and senate on the compactapproval bill still stands and 
that if palau wants more money it can return later to congress 
according to the aide 
house committee leaders including chairman morris udall 
dariz and ron de lugo the delegate from the virgin islands 
have quoted palau officials as saying the extra 40 million is 
needed to ensure compact approval by palau voters 
palauans have held six plebiscites since 1982 but each has 
fallen short of approving the free association arrangement that is 
similar to ones the united states has with two other former trust 
territories the marshall islands and the federated states of 
micronesia 
the problem in palau is that nations constitutional prohibition 
against nuclear weapons on its territory each plebiscite has won a 
majority but came up short of the 75 percent support needed to 
overrule the nonukes provision 
the compact process has seen the killing of one palau president 
the recent suicide of another deep political divisions reports of 
intimidation and harassment of compact opponents and allegations of 
governmental corruption 
the extra money proposed by udall and de lugo would pay for 
antidrug programs and special auditors to monitor the palau 
government their bill also would authorize palau to use 28 
million in compact funds to help pay off a controversial power 
plant that figured prominently in corruption allegations

calvin graham said thursday that a weight was 
lifted from his heart when the house voted to give him back pay and 
benefits denied by the navy because he lied about his age and 
enlisted during world war ii when he was only 12 
but graham who was injured aboard the uss south dakota during 
the battle of guadalcanal says hes still crossing his fingers 
that the legislation will clear the senate before it adjourns for 
the year possibly as soon as next week 
its not that much money he said from his home in fort 
worth texas its the pride of the thing to me that would be 
worth a lot to me 
graham was discharged from the military 45 years ago when he 
returned from the pacific and was thrown into the brig because of 
his age 
graham was denied his mustering out benefits and was granted 
disability status for one tooth although he claims he lost all of 
his teeth after shrapnel ripped through his mouth at guadalcanal 
the legislation approved on a unanimous voice vote tuesday in 
the house would compensate graham with 18000 for his mouth 
injury and give him mustering out benefits of 4917 
the military in 1980 offered to give graham back pay and 
mustering out benefits of 337 what he would have received upon 
his discharge in 1943 but rep martin frost and house speaker jim 
wright dtexas worked to get graham compensated in 1988 dollars 
with interest 
texas sen lloyd bentsen meanwhile is attempting to get the 
senate to act quickly on grahams behalf and has asked sen howell 
t heflin dala to help move the bill out of the senate 
judiciary subcommittee that he chairs 
the navy in 1978 granted graham an honorable discharge bentsen 
said 
grahams story was the subject of a cbs television movie too 
young the hero earlier this year and frost said he believes the 
publicity finally stirred congress into acting the bill had been 
introduced four or five times previously 
graham rejoined the service when he reached the proper age and 
served with the marines during the korean war he is now confined 
to a wheelchair from injuries suffered during a fall from a pier in 
california years ago

president mikhail s gorbachev will probably meet 
with chinese leaders early next year and also plans to visit north 
korea the kremlin said thursday 
igor a rogachev deputy foreign minister in charge of contacts 
with china was asked whether a sovietchinese summit would follow 
a meeting this year between the two foreign ministers and whether 
the summit would occur in the first half of 1989 as chinese reports 
have indicated 
my sense is that one might be in a position to suggest that 
both would be the case rogachev replied at a news conference 
moscow and beijing have been at odds since the 1960s nikita s 
khrushchev and mao tsetung held the last summit in 1959 
gorbachev has taken several actions that opened the way to 
better relations including withdrawal of soviet soldiers from 
afghanistan reducing troop strength on the chinese border and 
agreeing in august to the first direct talks with china about 
vietnamese occupation of cambodia 
foreign minister qian quichen of china met with the soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze last month and plans to 
visit moscow later this year but no date has been set rogachev 
said cambodia where the soviet union supports vietnams 
occupation will be high on the agenda 
rogachev has represented the kremlin in the talks with china on 
cambodia 
he did not say whether gorbachev would travel to beijing or 
chinese leaders would visit moscow gorbachev broached the idea of 
a summit in a speech sept 16 in siberia 
on thursday rogachev told reporters the kremlin hopes relations 
with china can be based on friendship and goodneighborliness 
gorbachevs visit to north korea will fulfill a commitment made 
by andrei a gromyko soviet news reports sept 26 said gromyko 
would visit north korea as the soviet president in the first 10 
days of october 
gromyko was retired from the presidency and the ruling communist 
party politburo last week however and gorbachev was elected 
president 
rogachev told the news conference gorbachev has a standing 
invitation to visit north korea and expects to do so but has not 
set a date

a virus is causing an epidemic of 
genital warts and appears to underlie the rise in cervical cancer 
a doctor said at a science writers meeting 
it is now clear that transmission of these viral agents has 
reached epidemic proportions dr gary schoolnik an associate 
professor at the stanford university medical center said wednesday 
at the meeting held by the american medical association 
the infection known as papilloma virus is a group of 46 
viruses that cause warts of the dozen or more of the viruses that 
cause genital warts five have been firmly linked to precancerous 
changes in cervical cells the cervix is the opening of the uterus 
the five viruses are often missed by traditional pap smear 
examinations 
but the food and drug administration is expected to approve a 
test within weeks that detects the virus with far greater accuracy 
and can determine when a very dangerous form of the virus is 
present schoolnik said 
genital papilloma virus infections are the most common sexually 
transmitted disease in many communities more frequent than 
syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia and herpes he said 
schoolnik called the infection the sexually transmitted 
disease of the 90s following herpes in the 70s and deadly aids 
in the 80s 
the rate of genital warts has increased six fold in the past 10 
years he said 
a survey of san francisco bay area adolescent clinics found that 
20 percent of sexually active girls between 14 and 18 years old 
were infected by the virus said schoolnik who conducted the 
survey 
last year 14000 american women were diagnosed with cervical 
cancer which can be cured if detected early but is fatal if left 
untreated

an exultant lloyd bentsen flew home to 
texas thursday taking new jibes at dan quayles need for job 
training while accepting fellow democrats accolades for his 
performance against quayle in the vice presidential debate 
last night the eyes of texas and the whole nation were on 
you and they liked what they saw democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis told bentsen before a cheering crowd in 
this rural east texas community 
bentsen and dukakis who usually campaign separately united for 
the joint postdebate rally bentsen normally introduces dukakis 
when they do appear together but bentsen followed dukakis to the 
microphones this time 
after listening to dan quayle last night i can understand why 
he kept talking about job training bentsen said getting a roar 
from the 2500 people in a lakeside park 
across the lake was a steel factory that he said has lost 
thousands of jobs to foreign competition bentsen said the 
republicans dont want to talk about that 
my friends if you dont speak of these concerns youre 
endangering america he said 
the texas senator appeared elated by poll figures suggesting 
most television viewers thought he won the debate 
gee those polls were great werent they he told reporters 
traveling with his campaign well i knew i scored some points 
and i thought i was winning but its difficult to be objective 
about yourself 
the dukakis campaign planned to take advantage of what they felt 
was a clear bentsen debate victory by airing new television spots 
questioning quayles qualifications for the presidency said dayton 
duncan dukakis press secretary 
the flash point of wednesday nights debatge came when bentsen 
told quayle he was no jack kennedy bentsen acknowledged that 
the topic had been raised during his preparations but denied his 
answer was a canned response 
what happened there was quayle kept comparing himself with 
kennedy just overreaching himself and i got fed up with it he 
said i deeply resented him trying to put kennedys mantle over 
himself when he didnt have a record that compared with kennedy 
democratic party chairman paul kirk who traveled to texas with 
bentsen said he was surprised quayle compared himself with 
kennedy even though the indiana senator had done so on the 
campaign trail before 
it was so transparent i didnt think he had the gall to bring 
it up he said but once that happened he was fair game 
kirk said dismissing republican complaints that bentsen was mean 
bentsen and kennedy were elected to congress together in 1948 
bentsen served three terms in the house before dropping out of 
politics for 16 years to pursue a business career 
the debate reinforced the doubts many people had about quayle 
bentsen contended 
the polls show that those that were concerned about his 
qualifications for the presidency had that buttressed by the 
debates last night he said 
he disputed quayles contention that the debate showed bentsen 
running away from dukakis 
no i came to his defense many many times i talked about how 
proud i was to be on the ticket with him he said 
after days of tension bentsen was relaxed and chatted with 
reporters at length on the campaign jet among other things he 
listed what he would do if he suddenly had to take the reins of 
power including quick action to make sure the soviets didnt try 
to take advantage of a us crisis 
quayle has been criticized by democrats for failing to give a 
detailed answer when asked that question several times during the 
debate 
bentsen said one of the last things he did before heading to the 
hall on wednesday night was to gather his wife and children in his 
hotel suite and pray he wouldnt say what he did afterward to 
celebrate except to say there were a lot of hugs 
after the lone star rally bentsen was flying to dallas where 
he planned private meetings a fundraiser and rest he then 
planned to campaign through saturday almost entirely in texas 
where the democrats still trail despite his presence on the ticket

members of john f kennedys inner circle 
enthusiastically agreed thursday with lloyd bentsen that dan quayle 
is no jack kennedy but they gave less support to the texas 
senators own claim of friendship with the late president 
lawrence f obrien who worked for kennedy in the 1960 
presidential campaign and later in the white house said he found 
quayles effort to compare himself to the late president both 
laughable and pathetic 
quayle can cite age family wealth years in congress and 
political ambition to support his claim that his experience is 
similar to kennedys when the massachusetts senator ran for 
president 28 years ago 
but when he drew the comparison during the vice presidential 
debate wednesday night bentsen quickly retorted 
i served with jack kennedy i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy 
was a friend of mine senator youre no jack kennedy 
republicans jumping to quayles defense branded bentsens 
remark a cheap shot while democrats denounced quayles 
audacity for comparing himself to the late president 
i agree with bentsen said former kennedy speechwriter 
richard goodwin i have a feeling it was a pretty widespread 
sentiment 
goodwin said i dont suppose the number of years in congress 
makes an awful lot of difference its a question ofwhat youve 
done with them and what kind of human being you are kennedy 
happened to be a much more intelligent betterinformed human 
being 
obrien when asked if he recalled any close relationship 
between kennedy and bentsen said the texan was considered by us 
a friend 
however goodwin said i dont recall them being quite that 
friendly im sure he knew him and they worked together 
the research section at the kennedy library in boston said files 
of white house correspondence between kennedy and bentsen who was 
in private business in texas while kennedy was president turned up 
only routine requests for autographed pictures 
much of kennedys correspondence from the period when he and 
bentsen served together in the house was missing a researcher said 
historian james macgregor burns said kennedy has come to be a 
kind of landmark president still revered by americans even though 
he served less than three years before he was assassinated 
his image was always so sharp and compelling that it lingers 
in the national memory he said 
that may explain why republicans cite kennedy about as often as 
democrats do 
turning to the quayle comparison with kennedy burns said 
literally their careers are comparable but the big difference 
was that jack kennedy probably because of his father and good luck 
and so on had been involved in national and international politics 
for years 
for example he had been speaking up against colonialism much 
to the annoyance of the truman and eisenhower administrations 
kennedys father had been us ambassador to great britain and 
chairman of the securities and exchange commission under president 
franklin d roosevelt 
goodwin also cited what he called the extraordinary way that 
kennedys memory has been resilient and enduring 
its partly a mystery but somehow kennedy became symbolic of 
the americans last idealized picture of america as young 
adventurous headed towards greatness great purpose all the rest 
of it he said 
when he spoke to a sixth grade class recently in maine said 
goodwin all they wanted to ask about was kennedy

labor party leader shimon peres was 
jostled booed and called a traitor thursday as he campaigned for 
undecided voters in this traditional stronghold of the conservative 
likud bloc 
peres go home chanted scores of likud supporters dressed in 
blueandwhite party hats and waving likud banners at the 
65yearold peres as he entered an openair vegetable market 
they taunted peres for conciliatory policies toward the arabs 
especially his proposal to trade parts of the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip for peace 
the crowd of about 400 surged toward peres who was knocked off 
balance several times but unharmed police linked arms to protect 
peres and security guards grabbed a man who tried to hurl a tomato 
the labor leader told the associated press it demonstrates a 
certain style that a better part of the israeli people do not like 
to see 
the crowd was made up mostly of young sephardim or jews whose 
familes immigrated from middle east countries and who now account 
for a slight majority of israels 34 million jews they voted 
heavily for likud in the 1977 elections and ended 29 years of rule 
by the labor party which was dominated by askenazi jews 
originating from europe 
in a meeting with party workers peres acknowledged that the 
workingclass town of 37000 residents including 5300 arabs had 
been a likud stronghold but said we hope to change that 
peres then set out on a 90minute walk down herzl street the 
main commercial throughfare he sought out voters who said they had 
not made up their minds or who had voted for prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs likud bloc in the past 
independent pollsters estimate the undecided account for more 
than 20 percent of the electorate and could determine the outcome 
of the nov 1 balloting 
to retirees housewives shopowners and the unemployed his 
message was the same keeping the west bank and gaza strip would 
mean annexing a large palestinian balance that would threaten the 
jewish nature of the state 
we mustnt lose the jewish majority in israel if the likud 
wins there will be an arab majority shamir doesnt want a 
palestinian state but he will bring one about peres argued 
he noted 35 million jews and 24 million arabs already lived in 
israeliheld territory and the populations would be nearly equal 
early next century 
at one point peres stopped a housewife in her 20s and persuaded 
her to put out a cigarette she was smoking i smoked for 40 
years but i quit and now i feel much better said peres a 
reformed threepackaday puffer 
but he had more difficulty in getting her vote the woman said 
she had been forced to leave her home in the sinai desert when the 
land was returned to egypt 
because of the territories its difficult for me to vote for 
labor she said

four senators on thursday asked an independent 
committee to review safety and operations at the savannah river 
plant a south carolina facility that produces nuclear weapons 
material 
the plant run by ei du pont de nemours amp co under contract 
from the energy department has come under increasing scrutiny 
since disclosures last week that as many as 30 major mishaps there 
over three decades had not been reported to department headquarters 
or disclosed to the public 
the alleged questionable safety and operating procedures 
detailed in internal documents from du pont and the department 
continued until this august when the latest incident caused 
engineers to shut down the preactor at the plant the facilitys 
other two reactors also have been shut down 
we are very concerned about both the august 1988 incident at 
preactor and earlier incidents discussed in a recently disclosed 
1985 du pont memorandum said the letter signed by sens ernest 
hollings dsc james mcclure ridaho bennett johnston dla 
and mark hatfield rore 
they called for an investigation by the advisory committee on 
nuclear facilities safety which is headed john f ahearne and was 
established by energy secretary john herrington to give independent 
assessments of operations at nuclear facilities 
ahearne expressed concern over the failure of du pont and energy 
department officials to notify him during the august incident 
according to detailed report on the mishap released thursday by the 
department 
the report concluded that despite a power pulse there was no 
accident no nearmiss and the reactor was not out of control 
the decision was made to shut down preactor a strategic 
defense facility even though no imminent safety hazard was 
present said the report prepared by a committee headed by j 
phil hamric assistant manager for projects at the energy 
department 
the report found that engineers starting preactor on aug 7 
miscalculated the amount of xenon and tritium in the reactor and 
used an unorthodox method of adjusting two of the rods used to 
control the nuclear reaction the reactor experienced a small power 
pulse or blip the next day 
the reactor was shut down on aug 17 under orders from officials 
of the energy department and du pont at savannah river 
a detailed analysis disclosed that two full weak control rods 
35a and 53f were found to be at their full up position when they 
should have been fully inserted the hamric report said no 
reason nor accurate time for the occurrence was annotated in the 
operating logs 
as a fix operators drove rods 35a and 53f back to their 
original positions by using a device for positioning single 
rods by bypassing their normal control signal path the report 
said 
a concise and clear log entry was not made it said such 
joint movement of control rods had never previously been seen by 
this operating shift but restart continued normally 
a spokesman for du pont said company officials had not yet seen 
the hamric report but have moved to correct some of the 
deficiencies 
some of these problems have been identified spokesman clif 
webb said we have been thinking about making these changes for 
some time 
ahearne head of the independent committee was informed of the 
unusual procedures not by du pont or energy department officials 
but by a newspaper reporter who called him on aug 16 the report 
said and he was surprised to learn of the situation at savannah 
river 
the following morning ahearne sent a request by telecopier 
asking du pont and energy department officials at savannah river 
for full information the report said 
ahearne was out his office thursday and did not respond to 
inquiries from the associated press

the reagan administration responded quickly 
and with jubilation thursday to the vote in chile to reject 
president augusto pinochets bid to extend his 15year rule 
but the head of a private research group said the margin of 
victory for the generals opponents 547 percent to 43 percent 
was too narrow to finish him off politically 
the old fox is in good shape said larry birns director of 
the council on hemispheric affairs he said the christian 
democratic and socialist opposition is divided and that pinochet 
could run in next years election and defeat separate candidates 
the opposition did not crush pinochet birns said in an 
interviewthose on the extreme left and the extreme right 
probably will resume violent activities which were suspended for 
the period of the election this could produce a situation where 
pinochet can say the chaos i predicted is returning to chile and 
the state of emergency has to be reimposed 
the state department and the white house however voiced 
pleasure with the way the referendum was conducted and appeared to 
bless the results as well 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the voting was an important 
step toward democracy 
she also praised the pinochet government for accepting the 
results 
we congratulate the people of chile for having given the world 
such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box 
mrs oakley said they turned out in exceptionally high numbers 
and took part in an exemplary voting process which they helped 
administer 
her statement also credited the chilean armed forces with 
protecting the polling places and said they had guaranteed order 
in an admirable manner 
mrs oakley called on pinochets supporters and opponents to 
work together to build a new national consensus 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration was pleased with the process of the plebiscite 
and we congratulate the chilean people on carrying this forth 
the spokesman refused to comment on the results directly 
saying we wont comment on individual chileans and who won or 
lost but we think they are on the right track 
we welcome the democratic process and we hope that it will be 
carried out peacefully and effectively in the next year he added 
asked if the administration believed that pinochet would move 
toward democratic elections the spokesman said of the chilean 
president hes indicated he will accept it and work toward 
elections a year from now and we hope thats the case 
the elections would be held in december 1989 had pinochet won 
the referendum he could have remained in office until 1997 
before the balloting the reagan administration and harry g 
barnes jr the us ambassador to santiago did not disguise their 
distaste for pinochet 
secretary of state george p shultz met last week in new york 
with foreign minister ricardo garcia and underscored that the 
united states favored a free and fair election 
on monday the state department registered concern that the 
government would interfere with the balloting on tuesday mrs 
oakley said the department had received and welcomed assurances 
from chile that the outcome of the plebiscite would be respected 
meanwhile barnes who will end his assignment in november told 
the new york times in an interview in santiago on monday that he 
would leave happier if pinochet were defeated in the plebiscite 
i look forward to coming back in march 1990 when the first 
democratically elected president would be inaugurated if the no 
wins rather than having to wait until 1997 the 62yearold 
ambassador was quoted as saying

health officials will vaccinate every israeli 
up to the age of 40 against polio following an outbreak of the 
disease that affected at least nine people the health ministry 
announced thursday 
about 32 million residents will be innoculated and the program 
should be completed in a month ministry spokesman shmuel algrabli 
said it will cost about 31 million 
we hope this will help to calm people down algrabli said 
we are calling on the public not to panic and not to try to be 
innoculated privately there is enough vaccine in the country for 
everyone 
the government undertook the campaign after hearing 
recommendations from a team of international health experts called 
to israel for consultations after nine patients were diagnosed with 
polio algrabli said there are another three unconfirmed cases of 
the disease he said 
the outbreak of polio thought to be wiped out in the country 
was a surprise to israelis who are innoculated rountinely as 
infants the new vaccination is an additional booster 
polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus inflammation of 
the gray matter of the spinal cord it is accompanied by paralysis 
of various muscle groups 
just weeks before the israeli polio cases were reported last 
month the european world health organization to which israel 
belongs was considering declaring the disease eradicated in the 
region 
no cases were reported in israel last year and only one case was 
reported in 1986 the recent cases have been blamed on overflowing 
sewage 
israels health officials are now considering changing the 
method of routine childhood vaccination from the livevirus sabin 
to a combined innoculation of sabin and the deadvirus salk 
vaccine no final decision has been made algrabli said 
since the polio was first identified last month about 500000 
israelis have already received a booster vaccination algrabli said 
they include residents of affected areas and all soldiers in the 
army 
the next stage of the innoculations will start friday in the 
northern towns of acre and in the rehovot area where the polio 
virus was found in sewage 
a separate series of tests will determine whether the boosters 
should be administered in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
algrabli said he said tourists planning to visit israel do not 
need to be innoculated

the head of the american civil liberties union 
said thursday that george bushs attacks on the organization and 
the issues it supports show the vice president has aligned himself 
with the darkest forces in the nation 
bushs criticism of the aclu demonstrates he is willing to 
toy with americans civil liberties that are protected by the 
bill of rights said ira glasser executive director of the aclus 
national chapter 
while the aclu is used to criticism the group doesnt expect 
that kind of nonsense from a major candidate glasser said at a 
luncheon 
he has aligned himself with the darkest forces glasser 
said adding that bushs comments reflect his ignorance of the 
aclus mission 
bush in trying to paint his democratic opponent michael 
dukakis as a farout liberal has cited dukakis longtime 
membership in the aclu in his first debate with dukakis last 
month bush said i dont agree with a lot of most of the 
positions of the aclu 
though bushs criticism of the aclu has prompted an outpouring 
of spontaneous support for the group glasser said he feared bushs 
expressions could create a climate of fear in which it was 
acceptable to attack civil liberties 
while dukakis has expressed his support for civil liberties 
glasser said he was disappointed that the massachusetts governor 
failed to vigorously defend the aclu in the televised debate 
between the two presidential candidates 
bush attacked dukakis and dukakis tried to hide glasser 
said 
the aclu glasser said is a nonpartisan group with 250000 it 
supports the rights of americans whose constitutionally guaranteed 
freedoms are under attack

reported thursday 
the soviet news agency quoting its afghan counterpart bakhtar 
said three patients and a nurse were killed in the attack wednesday 
and that the hospital in the city of kandagar was damaged 
also wednesday a mine planted by terrorists tore apart a bus in 
nangarhar province twentythree passengers were killed and 13 
seriously injured tass said 
on thursday a rocket attack killed a woman and her four 
children in their house in the city of charinkara in parvan 
province 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters

a judge in a freedomofthepress case has 
barred any mention of a lawyers aclu membership in front of the 
jury because of the criticism the organization has received during 
the presidential campaign 
us district judge william beatty issued the ruling monday at 
the request of lawyers for brian lunn who contends he was punished 
by his high school in 1987 for attacking the schools drug policy 
in the student newspaper 
the trial began this week 
jay miller executive director of the aclus chicago office 
said thursday that to his knowledge it was the first case in which 
the issue had arisen 
lunn who is seeking 200000 in damages from collinsville high 
school is represented by jane whicher of the american civil 
liberties union and sharon knapp 
in a pretrial motion knapp asked that the aclus involvement 
be kept secret citing vice president george bushs derisive 
characterization of michael dukakis as a cardcarrying member of 
the aclu 
any reference to the aclu may well be inflammatory andor 
prejudicial the motion said 
at the very least there is the potential that jurors views 
about the aclu as an organization may draw their attention from the 
issues and parties in this case 
lunn contends he was suspended from school and removed as editor 
for writing editorials publishing cartoons and leading a rally 
critical of a requirement that students participating in 
extracurricular activities sign an agreement to refrain from 
drinking taking drugs or otherwise breaking the law 
school administrators on wednesday testified lunns opposition 
had nothing to do with the punishment 
lunn is a sophomore at the university of illinois at 
champaignurbana

a maryland man attacked by a convicted murderer 
on furlough from a massachusetts prison said thursday he will 
recount his experience in advertisements for a progeorge bush 
group in california 
cliff barnes said he has agreed to tape radio ads this weekend 
for the committee for the presidency barnes said he isnt sure 
whether his wife angi who was raped by the attacker would 
accompany him 
barnes and his thenfiance of oxon hill md were attacked in 
april 1987 by willie horton who had fled massachusetts while out 
of prison under that states furlough program horton broke into 
barnes house tied him up and slashed his stomach 22 times then 
beat up his fiance and raped her twice 
bush in his republican presidential campaign has repeatedly 
cited the incident to underscore his argument that democratic 
nominee michael dukakis the governor of massachusetts is soft on 
crime 
im not doing this for bush barnes said in a telephone 
interview from a washington auto dealership where he is service 
manager im going for an independent committee i volunteered 
this is not a case of someone exploiting victims i want to get my 
piece said 
while acknowledging that his agreement to tape the 
advertisements was tantamount to a bush endorsement barnes said 
im not telling anyone who im voting for 
this is not political i would have the same problem with this 
man dukakis if he was running for plumber of the year barnes 
said its unconscionable to me that this man dukakis hasnt 
even apologized to my wife thats whats mobilizing me he didnt 
even drop me a line 
barnes emphasized that he is not opposed to prison furlough 
programs in general only those that release firstdegree 
murderers sentenced to life without the possibility of parole 
barnes said he understood the california group was composed of 
conservatives from both major parties 
however the committee is an independent republican campaign 
started by steve garvey the former star first baseman for the los 
angeles dodgers and san diego padres to help the bush campaign 
barnes said he planned to leave thursday for the west coast a 
trip that will be paid for by the committee for the presidency he 
said he isnt sure whether his wife will travel with him adding 
that she is still haunted by the attack 
committee director lee stitzenberger said he expects the radio 
ads will be used in the final weeks of the presidential campaign 
dukakis who in march suspended the furlough program for 
murderers serving life without parole has attacked bush for 
politicizing the tragedy 
this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic occurrence 
for political reasons dukakis said in boston bush knows 
that the federal government has a very extensive furlough program 
knows that governor reagan in california in the 70s had a very 
extensive furlough program and tragedies as a result of that

the government should provide medicare 
reimbursement for the full costs of elderly womens mammography 
screenings the xray tests that can detect breast cancer early and 
sharply reduce death rates two congresswomen said thursday 
we need to promote preventive medicine not just pay for care 
once an illness has set in said rep barbara b kennelly 
dconn a member of the house ways and means committee 
mrs kennelly said the medicare catastrophic coverage act 
enacted into law earlier this year included a 50 reimbursement 
provision for the xray technique used to detect lesions within the 
breast 
a 50 mammogram is not readily available in the united 
states the congresswoman said the average cost for a 
mammogram ranges from 80 to 200 
mrs kennelly said the only place women can receive mammograms 
for 50 is mobile van clinics 
most women especially older women simply will not submit to 
being examined by a stranger in a van in the parking lot of a 
shopping mall she said 
not only is a woman more likely to undergo the test when under 
the care of someone she knows and with whom she is comfortable but 
doctors are more able to identify changes over time and are able 
to provide the analysis counseling and followup that are 
necessary to effectively care for patients she said 
a bill introduced by mrs kennelly would remove the 50 cap 
making medicare coverage for mammogram screenings the same as for 
mammograms for women already diagnosed with breast cancer 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said introducing the 
legislation now near the end of the years legislative session 
will help put it first in line so they cant shove it aside 
next year 
the office of technology assessment has estimated that screening 
women over 65 could reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by 50 
percent after five years according to mrs kennelly 
breast cancer took the lives of 45000 women in 1987 of which 
28000 were over age 65 many of those lives could have been saved 
if mammograms were readily available and affordable to those 
women she said at a news conference 
the american cancer society recommends that women over 40 
undergo mammography screenings annually

four americans threw dollar bills 
in the mekong river thursday and planned to direct a remote control 
toy boat across to the laotian side in efforts to free americans 
they believe are held in communist indochina 
the dollars sealed in plastic envelopes and the boat carry 
offers of a 24 million reward for any american prisoner of war 
brought out of laos vietnam or cambodia 
two members of the american group were captured by laotian 
authorities last sunday when they hired a fishing boat at this 
river town dropped the bills into the mekong and then went to a 
laotian village 
thai police said donna long of jacksonville nc and james 
copp of hamstead nc have been moved from the laotian village 
to the city of pakse and possibly the laotian capital of vientiane 
the remaining four members of the group on thursday threw 25 to 
30 into the river which flows on to cambodia and vietnam as a 
test and planned to drop more than 2000 in american and other 
currencies friday from the thai shore 
the boat donated by a florida toy manufacturer named jim rambo 
is to be steered by remote control to the laotian shore and left 
there the speedy 25foot boat is festooned with a flag reading 
you mias missing in action are not forgotten 
we are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will 
work said bruce adams of laramie wyo whose brother was 
listed as mia in laos 22 years ago 
the reward money has been pledged by 21 us congressmen and 
others in the united states and the information about it is being 
disseminated by the national steering committee for american war 
veterans one of a number of private american miapow groups 
we do not condone private forays they have not proved helpful 
and in many instances have proved counterproductive said 
chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff adm william j crowe 
jr when asked about the groups activities along the mekong 
crowe who was visiting bangkok said although the us 
government put very high priority on the mia issue we have not 
as yet been able to confirm a single case where reports of live 
americans in indochina proved true 
the us government lists 2393 americans as mia from the 
indochina war in cambodia laos and vietnam the three indochinese 
governments deny holding live americans and both laos and vietnam 
are extending help to the us government in resolving the issue

president kennedy worried that leaks from congress 
about his military chiefs testimony would scuttle the historic 
nuclear test ban treaty according to secret oval office tapes 
released thursday 
the conversations involving kennedy his top advisers and senate 
leaders in the summer of 1963 show a president personally engaged 
in the strategy nosecounting and public relations required to 
push a major treaty through the us senate 
kennedys chief worry was that a hostile senate subcommittee 
would get the military brass to testify first in private then 
selectively leak portions of the testimony to suggest that the 
military leaders had doubts 
in the end however kennedy steered the limited nuclear treaty 
to an 8019 vote and signed it in his office on oct 7 1963 
exactly 25 years ago friday the anniversary prompted the kennedy 
library to make public the material on the treaty which was a 
portion of tapes whose existence was disclosed in 1973 
on aug 12 1963 kennedy spoke with a senate ally democrat 
mike mansfield of montana and shared his anxiety over the 
positions of sens henry scoop jackson of washington barry 
goldwater of arizona and strom thurmond of south carolina 
in my opinion the chiefs joint chiefs of staff are the key 
and what they will say in public would be more protreaty than what 
they will say under interrogation by scoop jackson with leading 
questions and barry goldwater and strom kennedy told mansfield 
the president wanted the chiefs to testfy first in public 
before the foreign relations committee chaired by the more 
sympathetic william fulbright of arkansas kennedy wanted to head 
off closed testimony by the chiefs before the armed services 
subcommittee on preparedness investigation chaired by conservative 
democrat john stennis of mississippi 
what i am concerned about is that these chiefs will write in 
private a record which they will then feel obliged to sustain in 
public well if we could get them on public record and publicize 
that to the nation then whatever was leaked out of the committee 
would have much less impact 
mansfield remained worried warning against getting stennis 
back up 
yeah well this is bigger than than stennis kennedy said 
the limited nuclear test ban treaty was initialed in moscow on 
aug 5 1963 between the soviet union the united states and great 
britain the three nations agreed to ban nuclear explosions in the 
air underwater and on land but allowed continued testing 
underground 
kennedy had proposed a comprehensive ban but soviet leader 
nikita s khrushchev vetoed the idea said sheldon stern a 
historian at the kennedy library since 1963 the issue of a total 
ban has arisen several times but the superpowers have never agreed 
stern said the oval office tapes included no dramatic 
revelations but supplied a closeup look at the treaty process 
its a mixture of so many different levels of concern 
constitutional diplomatic political personal stern said 
the tapes reveal that kennedy was well aware of the sales job he 
faced to win a twothirds ratification vote in the senate and he 
made sure to enlist former presidents truman and eisenhower 
in july kennedy spoke with secretary of state dean rusk and 
proposed giving a presidential speech in favor of the treaty 
we got to hit the country while the countrys hot thats the 
only thing that makes any impression to these goddamned senators 
said kennedy who had left the senate himself just 2 years earlier

democrat michael dukakis presidential 
campaign moved quickly thursday to exploit the vice presidential 
debate releasing two television advertisements meant to cast doubt 
on both george bushs judgment and dan quayles qualifications 
the ads on the heels of wednesday nights debate are aimed at 
undecided voters concerned about whether the indiana senator has 
the experience and maturity needed in a vice presidential 
candidate the dukakis campaign hopes to lure them into the 
democratic column by reinforcing those concerns 
one spot called oval office depicts vice presidents 
truman johnson and ford taking the presidential oath of office as 
a narrator says one out of five vice presidents has had to rise to 
the most powerful office in the world 
for this job after five months of reflection george bush 
made his personal choice j danforth quayle the narrator says 
hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that 
really was 
the other antiquayle ad is part of a series called the 
packaging of george bush which features a group of actors 
portraying cynical bush advisers trying to package their product 
for the voters 
in the latest rendition called crazy the handlers complain 
that despite their best efforts at debate coaching quayle blew it 
anyway 
weve got a disaster on our hands one of the handlers says 
suddenly the words president quayle even make me nervous 
says another is it too late to drop him bring in bob dole 
asks a third its too crazy says a fourth its not that 
crazy the first one says 
the ad ends with the same tagline as the four others in the 
packaging series theyd like to sell you a package wouldnt 
you rather choose a president 
quayle survived the debate with no noteworthy gaffes but the 
consensus was that his vice presidential rival texas sen lloyd 
bentsen was the clear victor 
the two quayle ads are part of a major dukakis tv offensive that 
includes the packaging series and four direct hits on vice 
president bushs records on the environment drugs social security 
and education 
the dukakis campaign also plans to introduce an ad called 
failure based on dukakis contention that bush has failed 
every mission given him in the reagan administration the 
assignments have included leading fights against drugs and 
terrorism reforming federal regulations and bettering trade 
relations 
two of bushs newest ads attack dukakis the massachusetts 
governor for raising taxes and for letting criminals out of prison 
on a revolving door furlough program another new spot called 
his mistakes features massachusetts residents complaining 
about dukakis and concludes with a democratic woman saying shes 
going to vote republican this year

this is the full text of the statement 
issued thursday by the revolutionary justice organization 
threatening the safety of two american hostages as translated from 
arabic by the associated press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the name of the almighty 
the revolutionary justice organization watching events in 
lebanon declares that the destiny of lebanon has become within the 
priorities of our struggle in view of the new imperialist onslaught 
aimed at the revolutionary strugglers and turning it into a new 
israel and a north atlantic treaty organization base 
the chain of events which preceded and followed the presidential 
election poses the gravest stage of the conspiracy against lebanon 
because it is not a circumstantial outcome of a domestic crisis 
but part of a conspiracy by israel iraq and nato carried out by 
the mercenaries of the interior to partition lebanon as a first 
step to turning it into an israeli satellite and a nato base for 
intrigues against the people of the region and to attack steadfast 
syria and other revolutionary regimes 
the organization calls attention that those who made lebanon 
reach this stage and put its destiny at stake will not be satisfied 
with what they have accomplished they have graver and more 
adventurous plans that will push the whole region to the brink and 
widen the scope of the conflict especially with the rude call for 
imperialist intervention under the slogan of internationalization 
by a colonial power whose black history is mothering our present 
tragedies 
from its revolutionary and combative stand the revolutionary 
justice organization declares a state of utmost alert and will not 
stand handcuffed it specifies the following priorities 
1 we call the attention of all free revolutionary strugglers to 
the seriousness of what is happening and urge them to be vigilant 
and close ranks against an imperialist front plotting a black 
future we urge them to forget ideological differences because the 
destiny of all is imperiled 
2 we warn the conspirators and their tools that we shall mete 
out the just punishment to the conspirators we shall hit the heads 
and nests of intrigues in lebanon wherever they hide be it in the 
karantina headquarters of the main christian militia lebanese 
forces or hazmieh army command or bkirki seat of the maronite 
patriarchate we shall not be tolerant with the grandsons of the 
crusaders we assure them that domination of lebanon and its 
destiny shall remain illusive dreams from which they will be jolted 
by our nearing showdown 
3 we emphasize to the international conspirators that we shall 
use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies including the card 
of the safety of the hostages which we shall make the backbone of 
our confrontation 
glory is for the oppressed and immortality for the martyrs

the environmental protection agency 
says it has levied the first penalty of its kind in fining a pool 
supply company more than 100000 for failing to notify agencies of 
a june chlorine fire that routed 25000 people from homes and 
businesses 
the fines are increasing at 500 a day jeremy m firestone the 
epa attorney handling the case said thursday 
the fines totaled 101500 by the end of the day wednesday he 
said and would continue until a report is filed 
the northeast administrator for the epa michael r deland said 
wednesday that the penalty was the first in the nation assessed for 
violations of the epas community righttoknow law enacted in 
1986 
springfield mayor richard neal vowed to press the pool supply 
company until the city recovered 620000 spent in fighting and 
cleaning up the fire 
im determined to get that money neal said well 
obviously seek damages from their insurance company and if they 
dont have insurance well seek it from them 
deland said all chemical labs inc which does business as 
advanced laboratories was fined 25000 plus 500 a day for 
failing to notify epa officials of the june 17 accident and provide 
a written report 
he said the company was also fined 25000 for failing to notify 
the national response center the nations clearinghouse and 
response center for hazardous material emergencies when the 
troubles began at the plant 
a minor fire at the plant was controlled on the morning of june 
17 but firefighters were called back to the scene that night when 
a police officer spotted flames inside the building 
the subsequent blaze fed by thousands of exploding barrels of 
chloride tablets took four days to get under control at its 
height it sent up a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas three miles 
long 100 feet high and four blocks wide 
more than 200 people were treated at local hospitals for minor 
injuries from the fumes officials estimate that 180000 gallons of 
chlorine leaked 
in light of the magnitude of the release and its impact on the 
springfield community epa considers the violations particularly 
egregious deland said 
william hadley attorney for the company said it will probably 
contest the fine and he questioned its severity maintaining the 
epa in reality knew about this leak from the start 
he also said the city must prove the company was negligent 
before it can collect damages the epa fine is based only on the 
companys failure to provide a written report to date on what 
chemicals spilled how much was released and other information 
an epa attorney maintained the agency was summoned to the scene 
by state officials not company executives 15 hours after the 
incident began 
the states private cleanup contractor is also trying to recoup 
the cost of the cleanup estimated at a minimum of 500000 
residents and local business firms in the evacuated areas also 
have filed classaction suits against the company which lawyers 
said could reach into the millions of dollars

an aids victim who claims she contracted 
the disease from a transfusion at an air force hospital has filed 
suit against the blood bank used by the hospital 
the state circuit court suit for unspecified damages was filed 
late tuesday by kandra crosby sicuranza 18 against the northwest 
florida blood center in pensacola she also filed an administrative 
complaint against the air force 
ms sicuranzas mother sheila davis said she plans to ask 10 
million from the air force no amount of money is going to change 
the facts ms davis said my daughter is going to die but 
this will do what it can 
the suit alleges the blood center negligently allowed blood from 
an aids carrier be delivered to the hospital at nearby eglin air 
force base where she gave birth to a son in january 1987 she was 
a military dependent at the time 
after the baby was delivered ms sicuranza received four units 
of whole blood that hospital records indicated had been screened 
and declared safe by the blood center the suit alleges 
three months ago ms sicuranza learned that one of the donors 
who gave the blood she received had tested positive for the aids 
virus when he later tried to give blood on her 18th birthday aug 
12 she was told she too had contracted the disease her son 
however is free of the disease 
gene roberts director of the blood center declined comment on 
the suit but said the facility does not pay donors and complies 
with all local and federal testing standards 
ms sicuranzas lawyer george day said an administrative 
complaint has been filed with the air force as a prelude to a suit 
against that service 
thats what federal law says you have to do so thats what we 
did day said they have six months to answer which they never 
do what it really is is a sixmonth delay that gives them time to 
sort themselves out

despite their professed support for 
environmental cleanup and conservation neither vice presidential 
candidate fared particularly well on an environmental scorecard 
released thursday by a lobbying group 
sen dan quayle rind scored 20 percent while sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas rated 40 percent according to the league of 
conservation voters 
james maddy executive director of the league which lobbies on 
behalf of a number of environmental organizations said quayles 20 
percent score means he ges it wrong four times out of five 
i heard him say last night that he deserved a good grade for 
his performance on the environment but i guess we showed up this 
morning with his transcript maddy said 
of bentsen maddy said the texan had rated higher in the last 
congress when the league gave him a 50 percent rating 
wed prefer to see it go up a lot maddy said of bentsens 
score 
during wednesdays debate quayle was asked why he had voted 
twothirds of the time against environmental protection 
legislation 
i have a very strong record on the environment in the united 
states senate he said adding that he had voted for the 
superfund and to override a reagan veto of the clean water act 
bentsen derided quayles late conversion to environmentalism 
and charged it was this administration their administration 
that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up boston 
harbor he said the democrats were responsible for the superfund 
and the clean air and water acts 
quayle in turn attacked dukakis for his supposedly tardy 
efforts to clean up the harbor the most polluted waterway in 
america and his plans to ship waste outside massachusetts for 
disposal 
the league graded house and senate members by tallying their 
votes on several issues deemed important by the leagues board the 
group also took into account legislators cosponsorship of bills 
actions in committees and perception by environmentalists in their 
home districts 
the average score in the senate was 47 percent with republicans 
siding with the league 37 percent of the time and democrats 56 
percent 
a new dukakis cites the league by name noting that it gave 
george bush a d rating and they endorsed michael dukakis for 
president

the labor party reaffirmed its policy 
of unilateral nuclear disarmament thursday rejecting party leader 
neil kinnocks attempt to soften a position that has been unpopular 
with british voters 
labors annual conference endorsed a resolution stipulating that 
a labor government would scrap britains nuclear weapons and close 
us nuclear bases in this country during its first fiveyear term 
it carried by 480000 votes in a total of nearly 6 million much 
closer than previous ballots on an issue that has divided the party 
for decades union leaders cast huge block votes at annual 
conferences based on their memberships 
kinnock supported a resolution that said britains nuclear 
weapons could be used as a bargaining chip with the soviets and did 
not set a time limit he indicated the socialist partys leadership 
might ignore the vote in drawing up the nuclear weapons platform 
during a policy review to be completed next year 
todays votes were not conclusive he told reporters 
thursday night it is our duty to get a defense and nuclear 
disarmament policy which can enjoy the support and confidence of 
the people of this country 
ken livingstone a leader of the labor left warned kinnock 
if you try and ditch this policy there will be civil war in this 
party 
the defeat marked the most serious split at the conference 
between kinnock and a left wing dismayed by labors shift to the 
center after three election losses to the conservatives 
ron todd head of the transport and general workers union with 
125 million members led opposition to what he called the 
confusion and fudge of the kinnock resolution 
it sought to keep the partys options open by calling for 
disarmament by unilateral bilateral and multilateral means 
gerald kaufman party spokesman on foreign affairs said in 
debate that an unconditional disarmament policy would mark the 
end of britains role in world nuclear disarmament 
the question is not whether a labor britain would go 
nonnuclear but how we go nonnuclear he said 
labor adopted the unilateral nuclear disarmament policy in 1981 
two years after losing power to margaret thatcher and her 
conservatives polls indicate it was a major factor in the partys 
subsequent defeats 
kinnock a lifelong campaigner against nuclear weapons has 
shifted his stance in the past 18 months and now argues that the 
ussoviet agreement to destroy mediumrange nuclear missiles has 
created a climate for negotiation 
the superpower agreement does not affect britains nuclear 
weapons submarinecarried polaris missiles that will be replaced 
in the 1990s by more potent trident missiles mrs thatcher has 
bought from the united states 
nuclearcapable american f111 bombers also are deployed at two 
british bases and us poseidon submarines equipped with nuclear 
arms operate from holy loch scotland

six weeks ago julius tomin was so hard 
up he had to pedal 100 miles by bicycle to attend a world congress 
of fellow philosophers 
starting thursday tomin had a job as a barroom philosopher 
noel reilly is paying the 49yearold thinker 8500 to give 
three lectures a year at his beehive pub in swindon 70 miles west 
of london 
tomin thinks the 100yearold pub is just the sort of place 
where socrates a poor man who went barefoot might have engaged in 
his philosophical dialogues in ancient athens 
the first talk by the bespectacled philosopher was a discourse 
on freedom to a goodnatured occasionally boisterous but generally 
reverent crowd 
tomin a czechoslovak dissident emigre steered clear of greek 
philosophers dwelling instead on the meaning of freedom to a 
prisoner 
as customers sipped their beers tomin told of pounding on his 
cell door for a drink of water being refused and pounding again 
until he got it proof he said that wherever you are you can 
do something 
you can make your freedom work even if youre under 
interrogation theres a level where you can be free no matter 
what situation youre in 
customers applauded at the end of his talk 
tomin fled to britain in 1980 he hasnt been able to land an 
academic post but he refused to take a job that might distract him 
from his beloved pursuit of ancient greek philosophy that led 
authorities to cut off his 114 weekly welfare check 
tomins plight became public at a philosophers congress in the 
southern seaside town of brighton in august tomin had spent most 
of his money on registration fees and had cycled 100 miles from 
oxford where he spends his time poring over philosophical works in 
university libraries 
his job at the beehive pub entails giving a halfhour discourse 
followed by a halfhour discussion with customers 
a signatory to the czechoslovak human rights manifesto charter 
77 tomin won brief acclaim among philosophy scholars when he held 
underground seminars in his prague apartment in defiance of 
authorities his controversial ideas on platos philosophical 
development however have been dismissed by leading british 
scholars as ingenious but weak 
swindon once had a poor reputation in intellectual circles city 
elders banned the medieval classic decameron in a 1954 ruling 
that was overturned amid nationwide uproar 
one beehive customer interviewed on british broadcasting corp 
radio joked that his knowledge of philosophy amounted basically to 
i drink therefore i am 
but things have changed the city of 91000 has become the 
capital of britains mailorder book market and publican reilly a 
redbearded irishman believes tomin will further raise the tone 
opening night was by free ticket only and all 700 tickets were 
snapped up loudspeakers were set up for crowds outside 
who would have thought you could get all those people to come 
and listen to a philosopher marveled reilly 
he said his pub was no place for drunken displays 
manifestations of ignorance will never be considered a virtue in 
this house he said 
in recent interviews tomin said plato a student of socrates 
also had views on pubs plato complained in his laws that they 
should be places of generosity and conviviality but instead 
had become places where the publican robbed the people 
reilly thinks his visiting philosopher will have an 
important influence on his patrons 
rumor has it that some of them have been seen in the local 
bookshop buying books on philosophy recently so that at least 
theyve got some kind of a head start he said 
did he feel ancient greek philosophy had relevance today 
good heavens yes truth always has relevance reilly 
replied one cannot disguise it by buying flashy motor cars one 
cannot put tinsel over it truth is truth

police arrested 11 demonstrators thursday in the 
third day of protests aimed at shutting down atlanta abortion 
clinics 
the demonstration was part of a week of protests dubbed the 
siege of atlanta by the new yorkbased antiabortion group 
operation rescue this week 368 demonstrators been jailed and 
protest leaders have made allegations of police brutality denied 
by officials 
thirty arrested demonstrators have been released on bond police 
spokesman cal jackson said 
on thursday police dragged or carried some of the people 
arrested about 200 feet to a van while sympathizers in a crowd of 
about 100 on the other side of a portable steel barricade erected 
by police prayed or sang hymns 
seven were arrested police said for obstructing a car on its 
way to the clinic the others were charged with failure to obey an 
officer 
shortly afterward volunteers escorted a young woman up the 
steps to the door of the feminist womens health center while one 
demonstrator pleaded with her to reconsider the woman shouted that 
she was going through with it and ill throw the bloody mess in 
your face 
while some operation rescue members had pleaded with the woman 
to reconsider others claimed she was a plant brought to the 
clinic to give the impression that it was operating normally 
clinic directors have said demonstrations have caused some women 
to reschedule abortions but deny that the protests have caused a 
reduction in the number of appointments 
operation rescue first appeared in atlanta during the democratic 
national convention in july and stayed in town for much of the 
summer since the protests began more than 1100 antiabortion 
protesters have been jailed mostly on trespassing charges 
police have resorted to rougher more expedient arrest tactics 
this week which has led to charges of brutality from operation 
rescue and its leader randall terry 
operation rescue attorney bob fierer accused atlanta police maj 
kenneth burnette of kicking a protester in the face during 
tuesdays demonstration 
there will be serious injuries if police dont act with 
restraint he said and vowed to file a federal civil rights suit 
against burnette 
a videotape of the incident distributed to reporters by fierer 
showed burnette pushing a man with his foot or lower leg but 
indicated the man did not appear to get kicked and did not appear 
hurt 
burnette on thursday repeated the police departments resolve 
not to let the protesters close down these legal businesses if 
protesters could close the clinics they could close other 
businesses in your neighborhood or your church if they happen to 
disagree with it he said 
terry called the clinics illegitimate childkilling centers 
that have no right to be here there is no negotiated settlement

the chilean opposition buoyed by its 
ballotbox defeat of military president augusto pinochet now faces 
the challenge of maintaining its newfound unity in advance of open 
elections 
in addition potentially divisive issues such as human rights 
trials and the future of the communist party could sow dissent as 
opposition leaders pursue talks with the armed forces to speed the 
transition to full democracy 
pinochet lost a plebiscite wednesday on a proposal for him to 
remain in power until 1997 according to the 1980 constitution 
pushed through by the 72yearold army commanders administration 
open presidential elections will be held in december 1989 
furher negotiations between the military government and the 
opposition hinge on pinochets standing with his troops said paul 
sigmund a princeton university professor and expert on chile and 
latin american authoritarian governments 
i think it depends on whether the referendum loss officially 
discredits him within his own service sigmund in santiago to 
observe the voting said during a telephone interview 
sigmund said the navy air force and national police appear more 
willing to negotiate than pinochets army which has been fervently 
loyal to its chief 
they are more flexible sigmund said of the navy air force 
and national police theyve been predicting this defeat 
political maneuvering by top opposition figures for nomination 
to the presidency also is expected to influence relations within 
the 16 parties that formed a coalition to lead the antipinochet 
campaign 
sigmund said he expected patrick aylwin president of the 
centrist christian democratic party and ricardo lagos socialist 
leader of the centerleft party for democracy alliance to run for 
the presidency along with someone who will represent the political 
right 
aylwin and lagos helped lead the coalition created early this 
year after years of bitter feuding among the opposition pinochet 
often played on those divisions to strengthen his rule 
aylwin and lagos insisted after the vote that unity must be 
maintained and even expanded to include groups on the right and 
left who had been excluded in the past 
we dont want there to be winner and losers aylwin said 
to the contrary everyone must collaborate in the reconstruction 
of the country 
the armed forces have an important role to play aylwin 
added 
lagos moderate leftist stance offends many conservatives and 
he has hinted at a willingness to put aside presidential ambitions 
in the interest of a smooth transition of power 
asked if the promoscow communist party should be included 
lagos said all democratic parties to the right and the left should 
be embraced there should be no exclusions lagos said 
some leftist groups in the coalition favor including the 
communists 
however the armed forces are fiercely anticommunist and the 
1980 constitution outlaws communist groups and the propagation of 
marxist ideas they are certain to reject the notion of sitting 
down at the bargaining table with anyone associated with communists 
leftist parties also are calling for justice in human rights 
abuse cases more than 700 people disappeared and thousands have 
allegedly been tortured by security forces under pinochet 
especially in the aftermath of the 1973 coup that brought him to 
power rights groups say 
parties of the political right and center apparently 
recognizing the militarys fear of rights trials have approached 
the issue with caution they routinely say only that the truth 
must be known implying an investigation should be conducted but 
not necessarily a trial involving military figures 
the constitution also calls for a congress to be elected in a 
year but its provisions make virtually impossible any amendments 
observers believe the oppositions priority will be to ease the 
procedure for amending the document leaving other more specific 
changes for later 
leftist parties want it amended immediately to allow for quick 
elections and pinochets rapid exit from the presidency but aylwin 
indicated his party was in no such hurry the period could be six 
months nine months or a year aylwin said

half the voters who watched the vice 
presidential debate came away still doubting republican sen dan 
quayles qualifications to serve as president if that became 
necessary a national poll found thursday 
the cbs news poll of 412 debate watchers also found they 
overwhelmingly believed the democratic nominee sen lloyd bentsen 
won the debate an abc news poll released after the debate 
wednesday reached the same finding 
quayle was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent in 
the cbs postdebate poll up from 37 percent who rated him 
qualified before the debate but bentsen did better rated as 
qualified by 78 percent up from 64 percent 
though quayles rating improved id be worried if i was dan 
quayle because he still hasnt broken the 50 percent mark and this 
was probably his only chance to do so said keating holland a 
cbs poll analyst 
cbs found that the number of debate viewers who said they would 
worry about quayle as president was little changed 52 percent 
before the debate 48 percent after it just 17 percent said after 
the debate they would worry about bentsen as president down from 
22 percent before the debate 
cbs conducted the survey by calling back 744 likely voters it 
had interviewed before the debate the results were among the 412 
of them who said they had watched all or part of it the poll had a 
fivepoint margin of error 
asked who won the debate 50 percent in the survey chose bentsen 
and 27 percent said quayle the result was almost precisely the 
same as the 5127 percent split in the abc poll 
a cbsnew york times poll released tuesday put the presidential 
race at 48 percent for the republicans to 46 percent for the 
democrats holland said the postdebate resurvey found no 
particular change in that gauge

the assembly line which propelled henry 
ford into automaking and industrial history celebrates its 75th 
anniversary this week 
ford motor co planned a ceremony for friday at its wayne 
assembly plant there fords greatgrandson edsel b ford ii 
will ride off the modernday assembly line in a model t 
in remarks prepared for fridays events edsel ford general 
sales manager of the companys lincolnmercury division said that 
as in his greatgrandfathers time the company still is striving 
for quality and efficiency 
seventyfive years ago my greatgrandfather and his 
associates put in place the mechanism to realize his dream of 
building an affordable motor car for the great multitude using 
the best employees and materials ford said 
production of the famous model t began in mid1908 and quickly 
henry ford was determined to bring down the price of his product 
threequarters of a century ago and a few miles away from the 
sprawling wayne assembly plant workers at a ford plant in highland 
park were tinkering with an idea that would revolutionize 
manufacturing worldwide 
on april fools day 1913 an engineer in the plants 
flywheelmagneto assembly area tried out a new assembly technique 
that spread quickly to other component operations 
then on oct 7 1913 the entire process was transferred to the 
final assembly area the first model ts to be built by the process 
were dragged by rope through the area as 150 workers stood in 
place attaching components to the frame as it passed 
within a few years the technique was adopted by a wide range of 
manufacturers 
nowadays robots have taken the place of some workers and cars 
along the assembly line are raised lowered and tilted to make 
access for workers easier but amid the high technology the car 
moves past the worker much in the same way it did 75 years ago

ethnic strife in a disputed region of the caucasus 
is leading to job discrimination segregation and an exodus from 
trouble spots by people of both ethnic groups a newspaper reported 
thursday 
armenians and azerbaijanis are engaged in mutual dismissals 
at enterprises in nagornokarabakhs major towns stepanakert and 
shusha the newspaper selskaya zhizn said in an article called 
zone of discord 
many of the regions 160000 residents have become refugees 
leaving jobs and homes to seek safety in areas where their 
nationality dominates it said 
correspondent o akulova of the daily which appeals to a rural 
audience was clearly appalled by developments in nagornokarabakh 
which is attached to azerbaijan but has a predominantly armenian 
population 
how many mixed marriages are there in nagornokarabakh how 
many children from parents of different nationalities where will 
they go in this ethnic conflict the reporter asked 
the soviet government recently sent troops and tanks into the 
area to halt strikes and violence stemming from demands by the 
majority armenians that it be transferred to armenia 
violence stemming from the ethnic dispute claimed 32 lives last 
february in sumgait azerbaijan 
a delegation of lawmakers from the soviet parliament made a 
factfinding tour of the region indicating the degree of concern 
in moscow state radio said it ended thursday and the group would 
make recommendations to the national government 
president mikhail s gorbachevs national leadership has said 
sovereignty over nagornokarabakh will not be changed citing 
azerbaijans refusal to give up an area attached to it since 1923 
according to the newspaper report half the armenians in shusha 
fled after fires were set in several homes and armenian refugees 
cram the hotel karabakh in stepanakert 
children play in the halls and soup gurgles on electric hot 
plates filling the air with the aroma of a communal apartment 
it said 
azerbaijanis also have fled with more than 1000 families 
leaving nagornokarabakh for the nearby azerbaijani region of 
agdam the paper reported 
it said a 5500acre collective farm was split along ethnic 
lines forcing residents to parcel out everything from fields to 
shovels and rakes

a littleused law allowed police to arrest a 
woman who refused to be treated for tuberculosis and was believed 
to have spread the disease to family members officials said 
thursday 
margaret allen 29 of suitland was arrested wednesday by the 
prince georges county sheriffs department and taken to montebello 
rehabilitation hospital a state institution in baltimore 
she was in satisfactory condition thursday and was expected to 
remain there for three to six months a hospital spokesman said 
dr elin gursky director of epidemiology and disease control 
for the prince georges county health department said ms allen 
was arrested under a littleused provision of state law that allows 
public health officials to control the spread of contagious 
diseases 
tuberculosis which is marked by coughing night sweats and 
weight loss can be cured but can be fatal if left untreated 
gursky said 
health officials cannot force allen to receive treatment but 
they can incarcerate her to prevent her from spreading it to 
others gursky said allen was described as being in a highly 
infectious stage of the disease and could be jailed if she leaves 
the hospital gursky said 
several members of her family have tested positive for 
tuberculosis and are expected to receive treatment gursky said 
the criminal warrant was issued in july after health officials 
failed to find her to serve a civil injunction issued in prince 
georges circuit court said harry matz an assistant attorney 
general with the state department of health and mental hygeine 
matz said repeated telephone calls and visits to allens home by 
health officials failed to persuade her to get treatment for the 
disease she was diagnosed with last winter 
stuart comstockgay executive director of the american civil 
liberties union of maryland said the state has the responsibility 
to protect the public 
on the other hand i dont think state can force her to be 
treated but they can keep her out of the publics way if shes 
going to be passing the disease frequently and easily 
comstockgay said if it were the cold or flu it would be a 
different ballgame 
tuberculosis is an airborne bacteria that can be transmitted by 
sharing a close space with an infected person gursky said

israel may have to stop construction of a new 
satellite unless it can find about 200 million more to finish it 
a newspaper reported thursday 
the satellite designed as a communications vehicle and named 
for the biblical prophet amos is being built by governmentrun 
israel aircraft industries and is scheduled for launch in 1993 the 
newspaper yediot ahronot said 
three other papers said some army generals opposed the project 
because of its high cost official declarations have said amos 
would be used primarily for civilian purposes beaming television 
radio and telephone transmissions to israel 
yediot ahronot said the cabinet is expected to decide in a few 
weeks whether the job can be finished 
an israeli official speaking privately confirmed the report 
but would not elaborate 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post majgen ehud barak the 
deputy chief of staff called the project as a lavi fantasy 
the lavi was a usfinanced jet fighter project scrapped last year 
because of cost overruns 
other officers objected to the new satellite because it will 
cost at least 500 million the post said aircraft industries 
officials were reported to have said it would cost only half that 
other reports on the army controversy appeared in the socialist 
newspaper al hamishmar on wednesday and davar on thursday 
davar said aircraft industries and defense ministry officials 
were leading the effort to obtain funds military and aircraft 
industries spokesmen refused comment 
prof yuval neeman who heads israels space agency said in a 
telephone interview defense ministry officials may have objected 
to the expenditure but it is a commercial not a military 
problem 
he added however government ministries including the 
defense ministry may have been asked to purchase broadcast 
channels on the satellite 
news reports said the project was conceived by the private 
general satellite corp headed by former army intelligence chief 
meir amit 
the debate over amos comes two weeks after israel launched 
its first space satellite horizon1 which is said to carry 
surveillance equipment for possible intelligence gathering 
neeman said horizon1 will stay in orbit through november 
more than a month longer than originally scheduled he said the 
flight would be extended because the craft was orbiting at a 
greater distance from earth than planned

the justice department said thursday it will 
stay out of a private lawsuit against northrop corp which alleges 
the government was defrauded of more than 1 billion in connection 
with the manufacture of the mx missileguidance system 
the suit brought by eight current and former northrop employees 
accuses the companys electronics division of intentionally 
delivering to the air force defective inertial measurement units 
which guide the mx peacekeeper missile 
the 67page complaint unsealed wednesday in us district court 
in los angeles and filed in october 1987 says northrop failed to 
ensure that the guidance components were properly manufactured 
controlled processed and inspected it says northrop wrongfully 
received 1 billion from the government and seeks three times that 
amount in addition four of those filing the suit seek 
compensatory damages 
the complaint was brought under the false claims act which 
allows private parties to bring suit on behalf of the government 
and gives the government the right to join a case 
assistant attorney general john bolton said the justice 
department has decided there is insufficient basis for it to enter 
the matter now 
the government could enter the suit at a later time 
in a related matter the justice department sued northrop in 
august 1987 for 3 million for failing to properly test a component 
of the mx the justice department suit followed a private suit 
filed in 1986 by two of the eight northrop employees involved in 
the currently pending complaint 
tony cantafio northrops chief spokesman said the quality 
and reliability of the inertial measurement units northrop builds 
has been measured consistently since the mx system became 
operational in december 1986 and has consistently met or bettered 
air force expectations

republican dan quayle refining his 
response to what he would do if he became president said thursday 
there was no question that he would continue george bushs 
policies 
asked by reporters why he had not made that response during 
wednesday nights debate quayle said it was a very narrow 
hypothetical i hadnt had that question before 
at a fundraiser here and rally in joplin quayle said his 
democratic opponent lloyd bentsen failed repeatedly to address 
whether he would continue the extreme liberal policies of gov 
dukakis if he took over the presidency 
he didnt answer the question he waffled shuffled ducked 
and dived quayle said 
quayle told reporters he was disappointed the debate did not 
have more questions about foreign policy which he said was one of 
his strengths 
but it was the issue of his qualifications and the possibility 
of stepping into the oval office that obviously concerned the 
campaign thursday and quayle took pains to address it in his 
speeches 
when i was asked that question i made a judgment that the 
people of america deserved to hear me outline the level of my 
qualifications and the depth of my experience to assume the 
presidency quayle said 
i responded to that point and the core of my thinking is this 
there is no question that i would maintain and build on the 
excellent policies of a president george bush 
on his campaign plane quayle noted that he had answered 
wednesday night that he would first pray and then convene a cabinet 
session upon becoming president 
by convening a cabinet session that certainly implies that 
youre going to continue the policies of george bush i did not say 
that but thats certainly implied quayle said adding i 
think i did just fine last night 
quayle criticized the snickering and laughing he said came 
from supporters of democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis quayle said he heard them when he said during the debate 
that america was the envy of the world 
i think thats going to be one of the cutting edges of this 
election because they look down on america quayle said 
quayle attacked bentsen in strong terms saying that he had been 
unable to defend dukakis position and ran from michael dukakis 
faster than a deer runs from a forest fire 
i am proud of the man at the top of my ticket i am happy to 
support his positions and i wont run away from them like sen 
bentsen did last night quayle said 
there were signs sprinkled at the joplin rally at missouri 
southern state college reading dan youre no jack kennedy a 
reference to bentsens derisive comment when quayle compared his 
experience to kennedys 
quayle told reporters on his plane that bentsens comment was 
a cheap shot 
but asked whether he was glad the debate was over quayle 
replied id like to have another one 
the indiana senator had a long day of campaigning thursday with 
stops in missouri florida and tennessee he left omaha in an 
upbeat mood saying he was not worried about an abc poll indicating 
many viewers thought he had lost the debate a cbs poll released 
thursday produced the same results 
george bush is going to win the election hes still way ahead 
in the polls quayle said 
the dukakis campaign meanwhile released two antiquayle 
television ads that struck again at his qualifications one ad 
noted that bush had chosen quayle to replace him should tragedy 
occur and said hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of 
judgment that really was

tempers flared as a house chairman accused the 
head of the foreign agricultural service on thursday of concealing 
abuses in a government program designed to spur american tobacco 
exports 
this is a coverup rep charles rose dnc told thomas 
o kay administrator of the agriculture departments foreign 
agricultural service at a hearing on abuses in a credit guarantee 
program for farm exports 
i resent that kay retorted 
i dont care if you resent it or not replied rose chairman 
of the house tobacco and peanuts subcommittee you were covering 
up a fraudulent practice in the foreign agricultural service 
the justice department is investigating the program under which 
usda guarantees private companies they will be paid for american 
farm goods they export even if foreign buyers default 
tobacco shipments worth a total of 303 million were guaranteed 
under the program for 1988 according to agriculture department 
officials 
the controversy concerns a usda inspector general finding that 
14 companies falsely told the department that all of the tobacco 
for which they obtained credit guarantees was american grown 
actually some had been imported blended with american tobacco 
and reexported under the program the report said 
initial reports of a problem emerged from iraq in 1986 bringing 
congressional demands for an investigation tobaccostate lawmakers 
said the program was designed to aid us farmers not foreigners 
at the time the foreign agricultural service dismissed the 
concern followup by the inspector general however resulted in 
the allegations under investigation and which are agitating capitol 
hill 
it makes my blood boil declared rep robin tallon dsc 
who said he was hoping that the people who have broken the law 
end up in the penitentiary 
kay told lawmakers he was as infuriated as they were by the 
disclosures and said claims by exporters that their tobacco was 100 
percent american may have constituted fraud 
he said however that he had been surprised by the allegations 
and that he had seen no reason to question the assurances of 
exporters 
it had always been the policy of the foreign agricultural 
service to provide credit guarantees for the usproduced portion 
of exports that blended american products and those coming from 
overseas he said 
rose said that sounded exactly the opposite of what kay had told 
lawmakers at a june hearing and he instructed the administrator to 
produce any documents showing that such has been the policy 
after finding that the departments counsel was not present kay 
promised to provide the panel with whatever paperwork existed 
rose then called on witnesses from the inspector generals 
office and the general accounting office an investigative arm of 
congress who had testified earlier and were still among the 
spectators 
they said they had turned up no documents showing that the 
foreign agricultural service had ever maintained a policy of 
providing the guarantees for the american portion of blended 
exports 
gao officials said their investigation indicated guarantees were 
provided only for exports that were 100 percent american they said 
they were told that the only exception was for a type of baby food 
that contained a small amount of oil not produced in the united 
states 
kay told the panel that the baby food example indicated that 
the possibility existed that blended exports could receive 
credit guarantees 
that phase of the dispute is pertinent because the service 
issued a new policy last month under which it will guarantee credit 
for the usproduced portion of a shipment that is at least 75 
percent american kay said that was actually stricter than the old 
policy 
allan i mendelowitz gao senior associate director told the 
subcommittee that the foreign agricultural service took a 
handsoff management approach because it viewed the programs as 
commercial programs that are the responsibility of the private 
sector 
kay said that was not the view of the agency and demanded to 
know the name of service employee who had given that information to 
gao staffers 
i will guarantee you that he will be reprimanded kay said 
rose told the administrator to forget about getting the names 
i dont think you need to berate them for doing their jobs as 
we paid them to do rose said

george bush tried to rally voters 
around his embattled running mate thursday saying dan quayle has 
been unfairly pounded by his opponents but proved himself in 
his debate with democrat lloyd bentsen 
after barely mentioning quayle during two earlier stops in 
texas bush brought up the debate during an evening rally before 
several thousand people even after his campaign strategists had 
spent the day playing down the debates importance 
polls show that quayle has been a drag on the gop presidential 
ticket with many voters concerned about his qualifications 
democratic rival michael dukakis frequently belittles quayles 
qualifications and democratic vice presidential candidate bentsen 
stunned quayle in wednesday nights debate by telling the 
boyishlooking senator youre no jack kennedy a political 
hero with whom the gop candidate had just compared himself 
taking up quayles case bush said he did an outstanding job 
in the debate and he has been unfairly pounded by my opponents 
and last night last night the country saw what i have seen all 
along a young knowledgeable experienced american and i am proud 
to have put my trust in a whole generation of young people 
the crowd roared approval 
bush spent most of the day campaigining in texas first in fort 
worth and later in midland it was a day when the theme was 
supposed to focus on bushs call for a common sense attack 
against crime with emphasis on busting street gangs 
bush spoke before the fort worth crime commission an 
organization of law enforcement officials and citizens involved in 
anticrime efforts afterward he flew to midland to make an energy 
address in the community where he broke into the oil business in 
the 1950s 
in midland bush made only a brief reference to the debate 
telling an airport rally i think dan quayle did an outstanding 
job he did not mention quayle in his speech earlier in fort 
worth 
while bush and his strategists struck an upbeat note about the 
debate polls by abc and cbs indicated that bentsen was the clear 
winner 
arguing that the debate will have very little impact on the 
outcome of the presidential race bush campaign manager lee atwater 
said an event like that has very little to do with the election 
this race is going to quickly get back to the two candidates 
for president atwater said 
bush while warming up for a morning jog at texas christian 
university brushed aside a question about bentsens tart response 
when quayle said he was as experienced as kennedy when he sought 
the presidency 
im not going to tell you what i think about that because im 
out here to have some fun he said 
but bush supporters at the midland rally made the most of the 
exchange campaign signs distributed to children to hold said 
dans no jfk thank god 
bush has recently become more specific on issues perhaps stung 
by democrats barbs that he has been running a campaign of slogans 
and no substance 
in fort worth he assailed the prison furlough program in 
massachusetts under democratic rival michael dukakis saying 
1905 times he gave free unsupervised weekend passes to 
firstdegree murderers many sentenced to life without parole 
fiftynine criminals convicted of violent crimes never came back 
from the governors generous vacation program 
trying for an evening news soundbite bush tried a twist on 
toughguy actor clint eastwoods warning to criminals go ahead 
make my day reagan has also made frequent use of that line 
my opponents answer is slightly different bush said his 
motto is go ahead have a nice weekend 
bushs common sense anti crime program contained a variety 
of proposals old and new including use of the death penalty 
doubling the federal prison budget to build new facilities with an 
additional 250 million each year and converting unneeded military 
bases into state and federal prisons 
money seized from drug dealers and racketeers should be 
earmakred to help pay for more prison space he said he proposed 
creation of an antigang unit within the justice departments 
criminal division to coordinate resources of federal state and 
local agencies 
he called for new mandatory sentences for gang activity 
involving interstate drug and weapons trafficking and racketeering 
a fact sheet distributed with his speech said bush would urge 
states to permit the prosecution as an adult anyone 15 years old 
and up who is charged with murder rape armed robbery armed 
burglary felony assault or drug trafficking 
as part of the war against gangs bush saidwe should make 
sure that no one makes bail is given probation gets out on parole 
or stays out on parole unless they can pass a drug test 
in midland bush said dukakis had experienced a battlefield 
conversion on energy policy in his pursuit of texas voters he 
said dukakis had changed his mind after once advocating a windfall 
profits tax on oil companies 
bush said that dukakis in 1976 had said the nation must press 
for reregulation of natural gas these days he talks mushily of 
the question of deregulating natural gas of a delicate 
balancing of interests of protecting both consumers and 
producers bush said

the day after an energy department draft 
report sharply criticized savannah river plant management the 
nuclear facility suffered an equipment failure that led to a 
release of radioactive tritium gas 
the escape of less than 01 millirems of the gas into the 
atmosphere thursday morning posed no threat to health said plant 
spokeswoman becky craft workers at the plant the nations only 
producer of weaponsgrade plutonium and tritium were not 
evacuated and the mayor said the towns not upset at all 
the tritium was released into the atmosphere from the 
facilitys stack a statement issued by the plants management 
said the accidental release occurred as the result of equipment 
failure during routine operations inside the tritium facility 
a millirem is a measure of radiation a routine chest xray 
totals about 20 millirems according to ms craft 
the draft report criticized the energy department and its prime 
contractor at the plant du pont for poor staff training poor 
communications and sloppy operating procedures that have undermined 
safety 
the 50page report made a host of recommendations including 
stepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they become 
serious 
in washington four senators thursday asked an independent 
committee to review safety and operations at the plant in the wake 
of disclosures that as many as 30 major mishaps over 30 years had 
not been reported to energy department headquarters or made public 
sens ernest hollings dsc james mcclure ridaho bennett 
johnston dla and mark hatfield rore called for an 
investigation by the advisory committee on nuclear facilities 
safety which was established by energy secretary john herrington 
to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear facilities 
the new york times on thursday reported that a study by a 
consulting firm of the plants operations from 19711987 showed 
that chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures caused 
nuclear reactors to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a year 
for nearly two decades 
that rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry 
and richard w starostecki the energy departments chief safety 
operator told the newspaper that civilian reactors with the same 
number of forced shutdowns would have had their operating licenses 
revoked 
at the statehouse in columbia a dozen people held a twohour 
vigil thursday morning 
these types of mishaps are serious its scary to hear that 
theyve had fuel melts said michael lowe of the environmental 
action group greenpeace its just poor poor management theyre 
managing not only our lives but our tax dollars 
in contrast the longtime mayor of aiken said im not at all 
concerned about the townspeoples safety because of the plant 
its been there for 30 years and nobodys died yet said mayor 
h odell weeks 80

a federal judge agreed thursday to allow the 
chief plaintiff and three others to drop out of a lawsuit seeking 
15 million in damages against the ku klux klan 
us district judge charles a moye jr also ordered that the 
verdict returned wednesday remain sealed while he canvassed the 
other 53 plaintiffs they have until oct 25 to reach their 
decision 
the unusual turn of events began wednesday while the jury was 
still out triggered by an announcement by councilman hosea 
williams that he wished to drop the complaint 
the suit charged the defendants conspired to disrupt a 
brotherhood march and violate the marchers civil rights in 
forsyth county on jan 17 1987 
in a rambling explanation to the court williams a longtime 
civil rights activist said he had been losing sleep worrying about 
the bluecollar defendants who have nothing but their homes 
their cars and their paychecks i could not disrupt their 
families 
state rep billy mckinney of atlanta who joined the lawsuit in 
july objected to williams decision to withdraw and that resulted 
in a hectic day of legal maneuvering while jurors continued 
deliberating 
the suit seeks 500000 each in damages against the invisible 
empire knights of the kkk and the southern white knights of the 
kkk 200000 against southern white knights grand dragon david w 
holland and 100000 each against invisible empire leaders daniel 
b carver and edward stephens and marion franklin shirley an 
associate of holland 
participants in the 1987 march were pelted with rocks bottles 
and other debris thrown by people among a large group of 
counterdemonstrators who gathered in the virtually allwhite county 
north of atlanta 
a week later more than 20000 people descended upon forsyth 
county in a huge civil rights march that drew worldwide attention 
during the hearing thursday moye rejected a bid by williams to 
have mckinney dismissed from the suit but agreed to allow williams 
and plaintiffs elizabeth w omilama terrie l randolph and forrest 
sawyer jr to drop out 
the judge and both sides agreed that if punitive damages were 
awarded the amount would be reduced to reflect the number of 
plaintiffs remaining in the suit

a millionaire businessman and foundation 
president has been charged with sodomizing five harlem boys after 
pretending to take an interest in their welfare prosecutors said 
william barnes hunt 51 used his money to ingratiate himself 
with the boys families district attorney robert morgenthau said 
thursday hunt bought food paid some of their families bills and 
took the boys aged 6 to 9 to parks and zoos 
hunt was arrested aug 10 and charged with fondling a 6yearold 
boy he had lured into his car on a harlem street morgenthau said 
he said a neighbor had called police after she saw hunt invite the 
boy into his auto 
police searched the car and found a small black scottie dog 
toys an instant camera and film the indictment accused hunt of 
using children in sexual performances after police searched his 
car home and office and found four sexually explicit photographs 
of naked young boys 
the 33count indictment voted wednesday charged hunt with 11 
counts of sodomy 13 counts of sexual abuse and nine counts of 
endangering the welfare of a child the top count sodomy is 
punishable by up to 25 years in prison 
state supreme court justice thomas galligan set hunts bail at 
25000 and scheduled a hearing for oct 19 
the boys hunt is charged with sodomizing are being tested for 
sexually transmitted diseases morgenthau said 
morgenthau said none of the parents of the boys knew what hunt 
was up to he said they thought the defendant was a generous man 
offering their children a glimpse of life they would not ordinarily 
see 
hunts family put him in an undisclosed manhattan psychiatric 
hospital after his arrest because he said he was going to kill 
himself morgenthau said 
the district attorney said hunt might have been involved with 
many more children 
we realized very early on that there was probably more to this 
case than a single isolated instance of pedophile activity he 
said he asked that anyone with information about such activity 
call his office 
hunt an investment banker is president of own canoe corp a 
firm that offered counseling to children and teens and president 
of the william barnes hunt foundation morgenthau said

recruits who collapsed in the first 
week of physical training at the state police academy were unfit 
for the demanding work said a lawyer representing the state 
troopers who led the class 
at least half of those tested did not meet state police 
requirements said timothy m burke counsel for the state police 
association of massachusetts 
at least 16 recruits from the class of 50 were hospitalized with 
dehydration and exhaustion by the end of the first week of 
instruction one is just coming out of a coma 
burke said he represents the two troopers who ran the academys 
physical training program because they are union members he said 
no formal complaints have been filed against them but i 
represent members in any type of situation including allegations 
of misconduct 
state probes of the academys training by the governors office 
the state attorney general and the speaker of the house have begun 
in the wake of the reports of illness by cadets 
burke said he studied physical fitness test scores of agawam 
academy recruits who entered the 14week class beginning sept 19 
the cadets were from municipal police forces throughout western 
massachusetts required by state law to attend the academy for 
training 
burke acknowledged that state police requirements are more 
stringent than those for municipal forces he declined to specify 
the state police physical requirements i cant give you that in 
25 words or less he said 
he said the cadets test results were released to him by the 
state department of public safety and the criminal justice training 
council which runs the academy in response to a freedom of 
information request 
a spokeswoman at the state department of public safety said 
municipal police cadets undergo the same preentrance tests as 
state police cadets but the tests are entrance requirements only 
for state police cadets 
municipal cadets must pass only a doctors examination and a 
body fat test to be admitted to the police academy 
spokeswoman barbara kopans said the criminal justice training 
council had been considering changing its fitness requirements when 
several members of the agawam class fell ill 
timothy shepard 25 of pittsfield who collapsed the first day 
of class at the academy emerged from his coma thursday and 
listened to the american league baseball championship series on the 
radio his family said thursday

an operating room flash fire fatally burned a 
15dayold premature baby undergoing emergency heart surgery 
thursday a hospital spokesman said 
the 2pound infant suffered seconddegree burns over 60 percent 
of his body in the 8 am fire he died two hours later said ron 
wise of cedarssinai medical center 
the baby was already in congestive heart failure and the burns 
combined to cause death wise said 
wise said the cause of the flash fire wasnt known our 
technicians are looking at everything the equipment was all 
working properly it is very curious we just dont know said 
wise 
none of the operating room surgeons or personnel was injured 
oxygen was being used during the procedure wise said but 
added there was nothing unique about this no one has ever heard 
of this occurring 
the infant born 16 weeks premature was suffering heart failure 
when the emergency procedure in the hospitals neonatal unit was 
started by a team of three surgeons a neonatalologist a nurse and 
an anesthesiologist 
there were flames and the baby was lifted immediately up and 
taken to the intensive care unit the baby was immediately put on 
life support but died two hours later said wise 
it wasnt known if the parents were in the hospital at the time 
said wise who didnt release the identity of the family or the 
name of the infant 
the staff and nurses up there are devastated by this wise 
said 
the surgery was meant to correct a congenital heart defect known 
as patent ductus arteriosus the defect occurs when a small duct 
between the aorta the artery leaving the left side of the heart 
and the pulmonary artery which leaves the right side of the heart 
fails to close as it should soon after birth as a result blood 
from both sides is pumped into the pulmonary artery and from there 
into the lungs 
normally medication is used but 20 percent dont respond 
wise said they went in surgically to try to correct it weve 
done this about 50 times earlier and there were no problems 
nothing like this ever happened 
firefighters responded to an automatic alarmed triggered by 
activation of the sprinkler system but the fire was out by the 
time they arrived said jim wells spokesman for the fire 
department 
cedarssinai located in west los angeles near beverly hills and 
other exclusive communities is sometimes known as the hospital 
to the stars because of the many celebrities who are treated 
there

tawana brawleys tale of rape by a 
gang of whites was a lie turned into a powder keg of racial tension 
through the hucksterism and opportunism of her advisers new 
yorks attorney general said thursday 
we have the facts we have solved the case the allegations 
she had made are false robert abrams said as he released copies 
of an exhaustive 170page grand jury investigation of the black 
teenagers story 
the grand jury said it found no evidence of sexual assault and 
said miss brawley herself was responsible for the degraded 
condition in which she was found after a fourday disappearance 
last november 
the investigation received no cooperation from miss brawley or 
her family who with their advisers the rev al sharpton and 
attorneys c vernon mason and alton maddox had accused 
authorities of a racially motivated coverup 
they have charged the atmosphere with incredible incendiary 
remarks and with extraordinary tension abrams said during a news 
conference he asked the state judicial discipline committee to 
punish the lawyers 
gov mario cuomo who appointed abrams special prosecutor was 
asked later about sharpton mason and maddox he replied is 
there anyone left in america who believes them 
miss brawley was found nov 28 seemingly dazed outside an 
apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in 
wappingers falls 75 miles north of new york city her body was 
smeared with feces and scrawled with racial slurs 
she claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by 
several white men and she implicated law enforcement officials in 
the attack 
the grand jury provided no reason for miss brawley to lie but 
noted that she had been punished and beaten on previous occasions 
by her mother and her mothers boyfriend ralph king for leaving 
home and staying out late 
the report cleared assistant district attorney stephen pagones 
and harry crist jr a policeman who committed suicide shortly 
after miss brawley was found both were accused by her advisers of 
taking part in the alleged attack 
abrams charged the brawley lawyers lied repeatedly about the 
case urged their clients to break the law and made every effort 
to prevent the criminal justice system from uncovering the truth of 
what happened to tawana brawley 
the attorney general accused the advisers of opportunism and 
hucksterism in presenting their personal agenda and added 
perhaps the greatest disservice done by the brawley advisers is 
the reckless manner in which they jeopardized the rights of future 
victims of racial assaults 
miss brawleys advisers bitterly attacked the report 
what should we expect from 21 whites from dutchess county 
mason asked on new york city radio station wlib referring to 21 
whites on the panel of 23 it is clear they never intended to 
arrest and prosecute those people who did this to tawana brawley 
sharpton said abrams is not after people who rape black girls 
they want to stop anybody who will stand up for the rights of 
black people in this country 
it aint over till she miss brawley sings he said you 
dont know her story 
no charges were filed against miss brawley 
first of all its got to be recognized and reasserted that 
were dealing with a young girl said abrams but i think she 
also must realize the kind of turmoil she set in place as a result 
of her false allegations 
i think she needs help and should get as much help as possible 
so her life can be salvaged 
miss brawleys mother glenda faces a 30day jail term for 
contempt after refusing to answer a grand jury subpoena at the 
advisers urging but has so far escaped arrest at one point 
seeking sanctuary in a church 
her daughter also defied a subpoena but was not cited for 
contempt miss brawley left her new home in virginia beach va 
thursday without comment 
thursday night sharpton led about 200 people in a demonstration 
outside the offices of the new york times which reported details 
of the grand jurys report last week sharpton said events showed 
the newspaper had illegal access to the grand jurys findings 
sharpton said he and miss brawley would be in chicago on 
saturday to give our complete and official reaction 
the grand jury heard more than 180 witnesses the probe cost 
taxpayers at least 620000 and the case was investigated 
perhaps in a more thorough way than any other case in the history 
of the state abrams said 
the report examined miss brawleys behavior down to a 
microscopic level including analyses of dog hairs found in feces 
burn marks on miss brawleys jeans and carpet fibers found in her 
former apartment 
the report concluded miss brawley spent much of her time during 
the four days at the apartment 
the report said miss brawley apparently burned a hole in her 
pants scrawled nigger on her shoe smeared dog feces on her 
body and clothing and stepped into a plastic garbage bag in front 
of the apartment 
the grand jury issued recommendations to the legislature for 
legal reforms including a proposal that would allow the relative 
of a dead person to bring a defamation case when the individual is 
falsely accused of a felony 
abrams and the grand jury also recommended enactment of an 
obstruction of justice law 
new york has a law against obstruction of governmental 
administration but it cannot be used against maddox and mason 
because it applies only when a threat of violence or a separate 
criminal act is employed the attorney general said 
he also called for changes in a state law that prevented him 
from moving against those who helped protect mrs brawley from 
arrest for contempt 
under state law people can be charged with harboring a fugitive 
only if the offense for which the fugitive is wanted is a felony 
abrams said the contempt charge was not a felony

soviet television on thursday celebrated the defeat of chiles 
rightwing president augusto pinochet saying voters rejection of 
his bid to rule until 1997 proved power can be seized by 
bayonets but they cannot keep it 
since 1973 pinochet played the role of the firm but just 
father of the nation trying to make chileans forget the bloody 
history of his ascension to the throne his betrayal of the 
constitution the murder of salvador allende soviet political 
observer i fesynenko said on the tv 
but fesynenko noted that first of all pinochet will be in 
power until march 1990 and only in december 1989 will presidential 
elections be held in the country if the dictatorship does not 
abolish them first 
in washington sen edward m kennedy dmass said the people 
of chile have spoke eloquently convincingly and courageously 
after 15 years of military rule chile has said no to 
dictatorship and yes to democracy 
we congratulate the people of chile for having given the world 
such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box 
said state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
the west german government called on chiles military leaders to 
abide by terms for the nations democratization 
we hope that the government will now hold to its own promised 
timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free 
elections government spokesman herbert schmuelling said 
george foulkes a foreign affairs spokesman for the british 
opposition labor party and one of 500 foreigners who visited chile 
to view the balloting said its a tremendous triumph for 
democracy in chile a totally unique situation where a dictator has 
been voted out in a plebiscite 
foulkes added it is absolutely crucial now to ensure that 
pinochet fully accepts the decision of the chilean people 
some latin leaders reacted with restrained pleasure 
inargentina president raul alfonsin said the people of chile 
have expressed their inalienable right to decide their own future 
the results of plebiscite open the way toward the restoration of 
democracy 
foreign minister roberto de abreu sodre of brazil said 
defeating a dictatorship is not easy but when a government stays 
a long time in office it becomes a heavy burden to the people 
mexican foreign minister bernardo sepulveda amor in new york 
for the un general assembly said we congratulate the chilean 
people for this proof of civic maturity for this capacity to 
transform their own political lives in an orderly manner 
the mexican government which broke relations with chile after 
the 1973 coup gave asylum to many chileans including hortensia 
bussi president allendes widow bussi recently returned to 
santiago after the military government allowed exiles to return 
president francois mitterrand of france said he learned with a 
profound joy of the results of the referendum in chile and of the 
perspectives opening up for the reestablishment of democracy 
suffocated 15 years ago in this country 
in rome legislators rose to their feet in parliament to applaud 
the news of pinochets defeat the government immediately named a 
new ambassador to santiago a post long vacant in a sign of protest 
britains foreign office said we hope that the plebiscite 
result which appears to reflect the will of the chilean people 
will represent an important first step on the path back toward full 
democracy 
spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said the 
people of chile have given a great lesson of political maturity 
added laurent fabius speaker of the french national assembly 
its a country that suffered terribly for 15 years and now 
all of a sudden there is light and hope again

the owner of a las vegas resort who conducted 
two parties marking the birth date of adolf hitler apologized for 
his actions thursday saying the events were not only stupid but 
insensitive 
ralph engelstad told a news conference that the parties and 
reports of a room full of nazi memorabilia at his imperial palace 
hotel and casino had resulted in a living nightmare for his 
family friends and employees 
let me say once again for everyone to hear i despise hitler 
and everything he stood for engelstad told a news conference 
i cant tell you how much i regret my insensitivity on this point 
it was innocent but it was very very bad judgment and it was 
in very bad taste i now realize that and i deeply regret it and 
apologize for it 
engelstad read a sevenpage statement then left without 
answering questions 
reporters were then allowed to go in the room where the 
memorabilia was stored included were 20 world war iiera vehicles 
including german staff cars and murals picturing hitler with his 
staff at the opening of the autobahn and german soldiers marching 
through the streets of paris 
engelstad has one of the largest antique auto collections in the 
world which has been open to the public for years the room of 
nazi memorabilia is adjacent to the antique cars but has not been 
opened to the public 
the resort owner said he was preparing to open new exhibits 
including one featuring cars of former presidents one on rolls 
royces made in the us and one focusing on the axis powers during 
the world war ii era 
engelstad has been under fire for two weeks following reports of 
the nazi memorabilia room and the hitler birthday parties the 
hotel owner said the reports were leaked by people who were out to 
get him 
gaming control board chairman mike rumbolz declined thursday to 
comment on engelstads admission that the parties were conducted 
gaming agents have visited the resort at least twice to check on 
the displays in one visit they found a printing plate for a bumper 
stick which read hitler was right 
engelstad said thursday that someone else ordered the bumper

air traffic controllers in washington will manage 
the flow of planes into ohare international airport a move to 
help local controllers and clear congested skies the 
transportation department announced thursday 
transportation secretary jim burnley announced the change one 
day after the federal aviation administration reduced the number of 
departures and arrivals at ohare 
this year controllers at ohare have made 30 errors more than 
twice the mistakes recorded in 1987 four were made since last 
friday 
under the plan announced late thursday controllers at the faas 
central flow control headquarters in washington will monitor air 
traffic at ohare to enforce the limit of 155 departures and 
landings during daily peak hours 
it may be that they delay an airplane taking off at another 
facility it may be that they slow an airplane down said 
transportation deputy secretary mimi dawson 
i dont see it as a reprimand she said chicago is an 
anomaly we feel this is an appropriate action 
chicago controllers ms dawson said will still be responsible 
for directing planes to runways once they enter ohares air space 
were not managing the traffic in chicago she added 
were not managing approaches and departures from washington 
we just want to make sure that the amount of traffic stays within 
the limits 
during peak periods between 445 pm and 915 pm the 
maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land in good weather 
now has been reduced to 155 per hour from 180 at ohare 
the plan also affects some planes at midway airport on the 
southwest side because the airports share air space 
burnley said his department will study whether those limits are 
effective 
i have ordered these actions because todays operating 
environment in the chicago area may require new traffic management 
procedures in order to assure continued safety burnley said 
controllers at ohare the nations busiest airport made two 
errors friday one sunday and one tuesday the faa said ohare 
controllers 30 errors this year compared to 12 in 1987 the faa 
has said 
in comparison atlantas hartsfield international airport the 
nations second busiest has had just six errors this year and 
washingtons national airport just two officials said 
the latest incident at ohare came just two months after the 
national transportation safety board issued a report saying that 
chronic understaffing of controllers mandatory overtime outdated 
equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at ohare

humphrey the wayward humpback whale 
who wandered up the sacramento river three years ago was spotted 
thursday feeding closer to shore than other migrating leviathans 
we dont think hes lost or sick he could just be feeding on 
near shore fish said john calambokidis a research biologist for 
cascadia research collective which spotted the whale saturday 
morning at drakes bay 
fishermen also reported seeing what they believed to be the 
40foot humpback whale on sunday and tuesday 
coast guard chief warrant officer scott richardson said their 
spotting was about 25 miles off bodega head just lazying 
around 
cascadias sighting marks the third consecutive year humphrey 
has been sighted officially off the sonomamarin coast since the 
fall of 1985 when he blundered into the tributary waters northeast 
of san francisco bay 
for 25 days the 45ton whale wandered up and down the 
sacramento river delta gaining national publicity poking into 
narrow sloughs and endangering his life because he was out of his 
saltwater habitat 
the scientists part of a private nonprofit group conducting a 
threeyear study of humpback and blue whales say they are sure 
they spotted humphrey they previously spotted him in 1986 and last 
year 
researcher greg falxa said that among other things the whale was 
identified by multiple scarring on his dorsal fin humphrey also is 
easily identifiable by the black and white color pattern and a 
lateral scar on his 15foot fluke 
the only thing unusual about humphreys behavior is that he has 
been feeding well inshore from the other migrating whales 
congregating this time of the year near the farallon islands 26 
miles off the mouth of san francisco bay 
the researchers are photographing and monitoring humphrey for 
cascadia and the center for whale research 
the cascadia researchers are studying the populations of blue 
and humpback whales and their migrations and identifying 
individual animals like humphrey 
we have found record numbers of blue whales so far and about 
100 to 200 humpbacks in the area each year calambokidis said 
after humphrey failed to find his way to freedom in 1985 coast 
guard and navy vessels eventually got the whale headed in the right 
direction and he cruised back into the pacific ocean cheered by 
hundreds of people

nation thursday he will stay president until his term runs out in 
1990 as police fired water cannons and tear gas into crowds 
celebrating his defeat in a referendum on extending his rule to 
1997 
every man and woman of this country can be absolutely sure we 
will carry out completely the itinerary foreseen in the 
constitution pinochet said in a speech broadcast nationwide on 
radio and television 
it was his first public declaration since a resounding loss in 
wednesdays referendum i recognize and accept the majority 
verdict expressed yesterday by the citizenry he declared 
the authoritarian leader appeared in a white military dress 
uniform unsmiling and head slightly bowed toward a set of 
microphones he spoke in a strong steady voice 
pinochet also warned opposition leaders not to misinterpret the 
vote as a mandate for them or a rejection of an 8yearold 
constitution that called for the referendum the referendum also 
provides for pinochet if defeated as he was to remain in office 
until march 1990 when the winner of an open election planned for 
late 1989 will assume power 
no one can feel they have the mandate of the people to twist 
what the people decided he said the constitution crafted by 
his administration was passed in a loosely organized 1980 
referendum that opposition leaders said was rife with vote fraud 
thousands of jubilant foes of pinochet chanted he has 
fallen and marched in confettistrewn streets to celebrate their 
ballotbox victory over the military ruler 
an authoritarian system has been overthrown said ricardo 
lagos a leader of a 16party coalition that campaigned for 
pinochets defeat in a yesorno plebiscite 
some marches turned violent 
while tens of thousands of chileans demonstrated peacefully at a 
nearby park and plaza hundreds of youths near the government 
palace hurled bottles and sticks at police and dragged wood planks 
and other debris onto downtown streets 
riot police used water cannons setting off mad scrambles 
engulfing passersby walking along nearby streets tear gas fumes 
made many people cover their faces with handkerchiefs and office 
workers closed windows 10 stories above ground 
more than 20 people were arrested and two policemen were 
injured authorities said reports also said dozens of people hurt 
struck by police nightsticks or by tear gas canisters 
a crowd of many thousands mostly young men packed all eight 
lanes of santiagos main boulevard for blocks in a standoff with 
riot police 
with nightfall hundreds of demonstrators lit torches made from 
rolledup newspapers the tightly packed crowd pressed against a 
cordon of police officers who each held out fiberglass shields 
eventually the crowd broke through the cordon and was 
immediately dispersed by riot police several people were trampled 
as the crowd fled and were seen lying on the ground or doubled over 
in pain no one appeared badly hurt however 
at 850 pm 750 pm edt a blackout hit downtown santiago 
but power returned to the city in 15 minutes the cause of the 
blackout was not known immediately 
authorities allowed union leader sergio troncoso to address the 
demonstrators and to urge them to remain calm 
we have to be careful of the women and children who are 
here troncoso said the demonstrators yelled insults at police 
calling them murderers 
wednesdays rejection of the army commander who seized power in 
a bloody 1973 coup cleared the way for elections to return chile 
to democracy the opposition urged elections be held before 
december 1989 a plan that has been rejected by the stillpowerful 
military 
chiles last presidential election was in 1970 when the 
president overthrown by pinochet salvador allende a marxist was 
elected 
observers expect at least two opposition candidates will run in 
the presidential elections lagos socialist leader of the 
centerleft party for democracy alliance and patricio aylwin 
president of the centrist christian democratic party 
under the constitution pinochet will rule until the new 
elections if the military leaves power it will further signal an 
end to the military governments that have dominated south america

nearest military ruler to chile is gen alfredo stroessner who has 
ruled paraguay since seizing power in 1954

ministry reported 
voided ballots totaled 164427 the turnout was more than 72 
million of the 74 million registered voters

santiagos streets and enthusiastically chanted antipinochet 
slogans

bystanders and only attracted more participants by noon thousands 
of demonstrators had spilled onto the citys main eightlane

and he has fallen 
drivers beeped their horns with the chants other demonstrators 
marched through the streets waving chilean flags and opposition 
party banners confetti and streamers floated down from windows of 
downtown office buildings

average decline in stock values 
the opposition said it would negotiate with the military to move 
up the date of the presidential election they also want to strike 
provisions from the constitution that leave congress virtually 
powerless to amend it and give the armed forces both autonomy and a 
supervisory policymaking role

the congressional black caucus plans to issue 
a code of conduct for japanese businesses expecting sell their 
products to black americans the caucus chairman said thursday 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif announced at a caucus hearing 
that the code to be issued in a few weeks will aim to correct 
what he called japanese economic arrogance and insensitivity 
toward black america 
he said the code would be along the lines of the former sullivan 
principles a code of conduct intended to help the black majority 
in whiteruled south africa through training and enlightened labor 
standards to which us companies operating in south africa were 
asked to adhere 
the code was named for the rev leon sullivan a philadelphia 
civil rights leader who later announced he has decided to press for 
total disengagement of us corporations from south africa 
the forthcoming code would be aimed at japanese corporations and 
their us subsidiaries said dymally 
it would seek an end to racial stereotypes and caricatures 
offensive to blacks such as the black sambo dolls exported by 
japan and the hiring of more blacks as executives in us 
factories and distributorships of japanese concerns 
the efforts at persuasion would be backed by a buy america 
campaign during the christmas shopping season to demonstrate the 
purchasing power of us blacks who in the 1980 census numbered 
more than 26 million he said 
the black caucus approach was described as too weak by some 
speakers at the hearing and unrealistic by others 
the afrikanamerican committee against japanese racism a 
washingtonbased militant activist group announced plans to smash 
japanese consumer products in a demonstration outside the japanese 
embassy next monday 
the slap on the wrist that the japanese received in the form 
of a verbal protest from a handful of members of congress is not 
enough said elder yehuda chairman of the committee which 
describes itself as a coalition of black militant organizations 
africanamericans will not buy any more products manufactured in 
japan from trinkets to transistors from toasters to toyotas 
said yehuda who also advocated an end to japanese investment in 
the united states 
but adonis e hoffman a black attorney who once worked as a 
registered lobbyist for the japanese and south korean governments 
criticized boycotts as the civil rights approach to the problem 
and said it would not succeed with the japanese and could isolate 
black business interests 
moral pressure and outrage by africanamericans will not 
motivate japan to share the wealth said hoffman who now 
represents us black firms in international trade matters 
there must be a minimal quid pro quo to motivate japan to buy 
into black americas business objectives hoffman said adding 
that us black business as a whole has yet to establish a 
track record or demonstrate the wherewithal to seriously penetrate 
international markets or attract foreign capital 
two japanese concerns toyota motor sales usa and the sony 
corp testified on their efforts to recognize aspirations of the 
black community and promote its interests 
toyota has nine hispanic or black toyota dealerships in the 
united states plus an active recruiting program to find more 
minority distributors while financing live telecasts of black 
college football games said pat tobin head of a public relations 
firm representing toyota motor sales 
sony said in a statement that it has shown social responsibility 
that compares well with that of americanowned companies that 
have been sensitized to minority issues over the past three 
decades 
both companies said they contribute regularly to the united 
negro college fund and similar educational programs

stonethrowing crowd of 30000 people attacked their headquarters 
the provincial leaders had promised to resign after a meeting 
with serbian leaders earlier thursday in the most dramatic 
development in three months of mass street protests over ethnic 
strife and an economic crisis 
the development boosted a drive by serbia yugoslavias largest 
republic for tighter control over its two autonomous provinces 
vojvodina and ethnically troubled kosovo

the crowd outside the headquarters in this provincial capital of

democrat michael dukakis criticized dan quayle in campaign 
rhetoric and commercials on thursday saying the republican vice 
presidential candidate appeared extremely insecure in debate 
george bush praised his running mates performance and outlined a 
crime control program 
quayle shook off a poll suggesting that democrat lloyd bentsen 
beat him handily in their debate wednesday night and said the 
republicans are still ahead in the race for the white house 
most predebate surveys gave bush a slight advantage over dukakis 
with a little over a month remaining in the campaign 
bentsen preferred an instant abc pollrating him the debate 
winner by 51 percent to 27 percent i was just delighted said 
the texas senator that finding was reinforced by a cbs poll 
thursday that found bentsen the winner by 50 to 27 the cbs poll 
found quayle was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent 
up from 37 percent who rated him qualified before the debate 
bentsen was rated as qualified by 78 percent up from 64 percent 
in memphis dukakis turned quayles performance against george 
bush saying there are as we know going to be major changes in 
the supreme court do you want the man who selected dan quayle to 
be making those appointments 
the highlight of the debate came as the 41yearold quayle said 
his experience in congress compared favorably with john f 
kennedys record at the time of the 1960 campaign 
senator youre no jack kennedy bentsen shot back 
the dukakis campaign rushed to air two television commercials 
questioning quayles qualifications one showed pictures of harry 
truman lyndon johnson and gerald ford all vice presidents who 
succeeded to the presidency without an election while an announcer 
said bushs pick of quayle as running mate marked a lapse of 
judgment 
dukakis told reporters aboard his campaign jet en route to texas 
the debate was a real plus for us and called quayles 
performance very disturbing 
i thought he was programmed beyond belief extremely 
insecure this fellow dukakis said in lone star texas where he 
campaigned together with bentsen he didnt have a sense of 
strength or control or anything thinking about quayle being a 
heartbeat away from the presidency to watch that i think is 
very very troubling 
republicans from ford to ronald reagan rallied to quayles cause 
as the bush organization appeared to be practicing damage control 
bush aides conspiculously violated their rule about publicly 
discussing polls campaign manager lee atwater said the vice 
president was ahead in michigan and new jersey two key swing 
states he predicted the vice president would carry bentsens home 
state of texas by at least six points 
this race is going to quickly get back to the two candidates 
for president atwater said there are two gladiators in the 
arena that are going to count in the end 
in midland texas campaign signs distributed to children 
attending a bush campaign rally said dans no jfk thank god 
bush delivered his first speech of the day on crime without 
mention of his running mate or the debate instead he ridiculed a 
massachusetts prison furlough program by mimicking toughguy actor 
clint eastwoods popular refrain make my day 
my opponents answer is slightly different bush said his 
motto is go ahead have a nice weekend 
he praised quayles performance as he warmed up for a morning 
jog though and later told a rally in midland texas i think 
dan quayle did an outstanding job 
and thursday evening in little rock ark bush took up quayles 
case again he did an outstanding job and he has been unfairly 
pounded by my opponents he said 
reagan coming to quayles defense said bentsen resorted to a 
cheap shot unbecoming a senator of the united states with 
his muchquoted debate putdown of the gop vice presidential 
candidate 
bentsen disputed any suggestion of nastiness on his part 
what happened there was quayle kept comparing himself to 
kennedy and he overreached himself and i got fed up with it the 
texas senator told reporters 
however bentsen threw his jab after quayles one and only 
reference to kennedy in the 90minute debate one democratic aide 
speaking on condition of anonymity said bentsen and his debate 
advisers had honed the remark in practice sessions 
an associated press panel of six veteran debate judges 
unanimously rated bentsen the debate winner 148125 they said 
quayle got off to a good start but failed to buttress his 
arguments with specifics or refute bentsens charges that he voted 
repeatedly against the environment programs for poor children and 
veterans 
while the kennedy comment drew the most attention one judge 
stephen mancuso of the university of michigan said quayles 
biggest drawback was his repeated inability to explain the first 
steps he would take if he suddenly became president 
bushs first stop of the day was at texas christian university 
where he denounced dukakis and castigated liberal experimentation 
with crime he said he would add 250 million a year to the 
budget for the next four years for prisons to incarcerate the 
hardened felons and rising number of drug offenders 
adviser deborah steelman said the street gang proposal would 
cost about 50 million and would coordinate existing efforts by 
federal state and local law enforcement authorities 
after the speech bush went jogging with students at the 
university and was asked about the debate 
he said he felt as good as i did last night which is very 
very good he said quayle answered the questions he was 
knowledgeable he did an outstanding job and the american people 
know it 
asked about bentsens kennedy comment bush said im not 
going to tell you what i think about that because im out here to 
have some fun 
quayle sought to turn the tables on bentsen at a rally in 
joplin mo 
he said the democrat had a chance to address whether he would 
continue the extreme liberal policies of gov dukakis if he took 
over the presidency he waffled shuffled ducked and dived

attorneys for the soviet union and the us 
government joined forces in federal appeals court thursday arguing 
that international relations will suffer if an american 
businessmans lawsuit is upheld 
we have been working very closely with the soviets and we have 
made wonderful progress said justice department attorney douglas 
letter its important that this progress not be set back 
he was addressing a threejudge panel of the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals which is considering the case of raphael 
gregorian an american denounced by the soviets and barred from 
doing business in moscow after 14 years 
one of the judges stephen reinhard bristled at the mention of 
foreign relations saying isnt that something were supposed to 
ignore the political considerations in reaching our decision 
gregorian has sued the soviets for libel the soviets have 
resisted and the us state department has sided with the soviets 
saying they may not be sued for libel in the united states 
gregorians attorney gerald kroll ridiculed the contention 
that the case endangers ussoviet relations 
i personally think they have bigger people to fry than my 
client kroll told the court ive never heard that we couldnt 
conclude an arms agreement because of raphael gregorian 
john mage a new york attorney representing the soviets 
insisted that us courts do not have jurisdiction because 
incidents involving gregorian did not occur in the united states 
he also said the nation is immune from suit as a foreign sovereign 
its really two against one kroll said of the us and 
soviet alignment in court he has expressed bitterness over the 
governments abandonment of one of its own citizens in the legal 
proceedings 
i look at this as a contest of politics versus justice said 
kroll theres never been a case exactly like this before 
gregorians problems began in 1984 when after a 14year 
amicable relationship the soviets suddenly revoked gregorians 
permit to sell medical supplies in the soviet union until then 
his california international trade corp based in palo alto 
calif had done a thriving business exporting such items as kidney 
dialysis machines heartlung machines and batteries for heart 
pacemakers 
soon after revoking his permit the soviets through the 
official newspaper izvestia printed a story denouncing gregorian 
as a duplicitous negotiatior accusing him of bribery and 
smuggling and intimating he was a us spy 
gregorian adamant about his innocence took an unprecedented 
action suing the soviet union for libel in us courts he also 
demanded that the soviets pay for medical equipment still in moscow 
the soviet defendants at first ignored the suit but in 1985 
us district judge david kenyon entered a default judgment against 
them in los angeles awarding gregorian total damages of 413000 
of that amount 250000 was for libel 
the soviets refused to pay kroll said he would seize soviet 
assets and to dramatize his claim he took custody of a typewriter 
at an izvestia correspondents washington dc home as partial 
payment 
then soviet and us state department lawyers went to court 
the soviet agency vo medexport which did business with 
gregorian asserted its immunity from suit under the foreign 
sovereign immunities act and moved to reverse the judgment 
on april 5 1987 kenyon dismissed his own libel judgment 
ruling that he did not have jurisdiction because of immunity 
considerations however he let stand his ruling the soviets should 
meet their contractual obligation to pay for the medical supplies 
kroll appealed the ruling on libel to the 9th circuit the 
soviets appealed the contractual award as well as disputing the 
libel claim 
krolls argument is based on a theory that libel in connection 
with a commercial activity is exempt from immunities act and must 
be tried as a civil claim in us courts 
new york attorney martin popper who represents the soviets 
said in his legal brief that there is no precedent for such a claim 
plaintiffs fail to cite a decision of any court in the entire 
world including the united states that has asserted jurisdiction 
on a claim of libel against a foreign sovereign popper said 
the justice departments brief sided with the soviets saying 
congress did not intend that foreign states could be sued for 
claims of libel 
an additional view on the case has come from the washington 
legal foundation a public interest law and policy center which 
filed a friend of the court brief for gregorian 
wlf believes that the outrageous nature of the lies published 
by defendantsappellants is such that they should be held 
accountable the foundations lawyers argued a ruling for the 
soviets they said would reduce the ability of us courts to 
protect the rights of citizens doing business overseas

characterized george bush as a weak candidate and dan quayle as 
extremely insecure and programmed beyond belief 
the harsh attack on the republican ticket by the democratic 
presidential nominee came during a flight from boston to texas and 
at a rally in east texas with his sidekick texas sen lloyd 
bentsen 
it continued in memphis tenn where dukakis told a rally 
there are as we know going to be major changes in the supreme 
court do you want the man who selected dan quayle to be making 
those appointments 
my friends strong presidents look for strong vice 
presidents dukakis told about 2500 people gathered in this 
depressed steel town weak candidates look for something else 
dukakis with a sparkling lake and the struggling lone star 
steel co plant as a backdrop was in a jubilant mood as he praised 
bentsen and asked voters to judge the presidential standardbearers 
on the strength of their running mates 
when a nominee selects his running mate hes choosing the 
first member of his cabinet the first member of the national 
security council and the first member of his diplomatic team 
said dukakis 
youve got to choose somebody whos ready to step into that 
oval office at a moments notice and who knows what hes going to 
do when he gets there dukakis said in a swipe at quayles 
responses when asked repeatedly what he would do if suddenly 
elevated to the presidencythere was only one man on that stage 
last night who fit that bill and his name is lloyd bentsen 
dukakis said he referred to picking a running mate as a nominees 
first presidential decision and asked 
judge us by the way we made it and who we chose ask yourself 
which one of us fulfilled our presidential obligation 
dukakis whose campaign was seeking to capitalize on bentsens 
performance by airing two ads attacking quayles qualifications for 
the vice presidency said the quayle selection isnt the first 
time that george bush has failed and then cited what he called 
bush failures in the irancontra scandal the war on drugs trade 
relations with japan and reforms in the nations banking industry 
and regulatory practices 
it was very disturbing dukakis said while en route to 
texas i thought he was programmed beyond belief extremely 
insecure this fellow he didnt have a sense of strength or 
control or anything thinking about quayle being a heartbeat 
away from the presidency to watch that i think is very very 
troubling 
dukakis briefly touched on his economic promises and vowed to 
bring work back to lone star which the campaign says has lost 
5000 steel jobs in the reagan years 
but he spent most of his time discussing the debate chiding 
quayle for accepting massive foreign investment in us real estate 
and business 
as senator bentsen said so wisely and well we cannot let 
others take over our economic destiny dukakis said 
dukakis aides said neither of the new ads featured excerpts from 
the debate but that one portrayed bentsen as the clear winner of 
the event and raised questions about quayles qualifications the 
second ad raises the issue of whether quayle is qualified to be a 
heartbeat away from the presidency 
both were to debut thursday night joining a host of other 
dukakis ads in the campaigns largest advertising foray to date 
the democratic campaign issued a fourpage statement labeling 
many of quayles debate responses as inaccurate or misleading 
the statement challenged quayles debate assertions that he was 
concerned about the environment by citing votes against the 
superfund asbestos cleanup water pollution and rural drinking 
water programs 
it also accused quayle of misrepresenting the reagan 
administrations record on poverty drugs and human rights it 
pointed to increases in poverty and drug trafficking in the past 
eight years and the administrations failure to pressure south 
africa to end its apartheid system of racial segregation

in a major change for president mikhail s 
gorbachevs antidrinking campaign the kremlin is planning to 
increase production of beer wine cognac and champagne by up to 38 
percent to meet popular demand a newspaper reported thursday 
however the trud labor daily said the government crusade has 
gone so far it will be difficult to significantly increase alcohol 
production soon 
the drive was launched two months after gorbachev took power as 
communist party chief in march 1985 
we have to restore a significant part of production and 
thats complicated alexander s konobov deputy chief of the 
ministry of trades food division told the newspaper 
gorbachev in 1985 ordered a reduction in the production of vodka 
and other alcoholic beverages an increase in their price an 
increase in the minimum drinking age to 21 and cuts in the hours 
and numbers of stores that could sell alcohol 
he has since cited the campaign as a major reason in the 
increased life expectancy for soviet men but the antidrinking 
drive has provoked nationwide grumbling and even indignation 
because soviets now must stand in long lines just to buy an 
occassional bottle of wine or beer 
cuts in government alcohol production also have proved a bonanza 
for the countrys moonshiners sugar now must be rationed in many 
cities because of shortages caused by the thousands of soviets who 
use it to produce samogon or home brew 
konobov said the goal set by the 1985 antidrinking drive was 
noble but that it has been pursued by bureaucratic means 
so it is obvious that corrections are necessary he said 
according to trud the ministry of trade has proposed for next 
year to increase wine production by 38 percent to 675 million 
gallons beer by 12 percent to 18 billion gallons cognac by 28 
percent to 332 million gallons and champagne by 9 percent to 
58 million gallons 
the newspaper said vodka and other strong drinks would continue 
to be manufactured in quantities laid down by a government decree 
in 1985 
plans also call for more spirits to be imported from cuba one 
of the worlds biggest rum producers and from bulgaria hungary 
and other countries konobov said 
according to figures released by the official tass news agency 
there are more than 45 million officially registered alcoholics in 
the soviet union and the total number is believed to be much more 
as one of the new methods being tried to discourage alcohol 
abuse soviet television on tuesday night broadcast a us 
television movie titled life of the party starring carol 
burnett which told the truelife story of an american woman who 
joined alcoholics anonymous to beat the bottle

opposition leaders said thursday a new 
emergency law gives president daniel ortega dictatorial powers and 
is likely to be applied soon 
the law approved wednesday by the national assembly gives the 
president authority to declare a state of emergency and restrict 
civil rights for reasons of war economic crisis or national 
disaster it took effect immediately 
usbacked rebels known as contras have been fighting to 
overthrow the leftist government since 1981 and nicaragua is in an 
economic crisis 
the opposition in the 96seat assembly said in a statement that 
the law bestows on ortega too great a concentration of 
extraordinary powers making him an absolute dictator 
erick ramirez president of the social christian party said 
the new law consolidates the dictatorial and totalitarian state 
and just as in the chile of president gen augusto pinochet the 
nicaraguan people should say no to the sandinistas 
chileans voted wednesday against letting pinochet extend his 
15year rule 
ramirez complained that the law legalizes repression against 
the internal opposition to consolidate the power of the sandinistas 
and gives the us congress arguments for pushing military aid for 
the contras 
both ramirez and enrique gurdian acting president of the 
nicaraguan democratic coordinate the countrys main opposition 
group said the government could be expected to apply the law soon 
an emergency decree was in effect in nicaragua most of the time 
from march 1982 until shortly after a regional peace plan was 
signed by the five central american presidents in august 1987 
the decrees provisions included press censorship suspension of 
some civil rights and searches without warrants 
the new law goes further it allows the president to close news 
media and theaters intervene in mail or electronic correspondence 
take over private vehicles and businesses make preventive arrests 
and prevent individuals from entering or leaving the country 
it gives the president authority to expand or reduce his own 
authority to take the steps and to continue the measures until the 
reasons for them disappear 
the law says certain basic rights cannot be suspended they 
include the rights to life equality freedom of conscience 
asylum thought and religion to be presumed innocent until proven 
guilty to have personal property and to be free from slavery in 
prison 
the national assembly on thursday also approved legislation 
banning the receipt of any type of assistance approved by the us 
congress and destined for opposition groups the roman catholic 
church labor unions and individuals 
under the law any person found to have accepted us assistance 
could face between four and 12 years imprisonment 
president reagan signed a new 27 million sixmonth 
nonmilitary aid package for the contras oct 1 
on tuesday honduras asked the united nations to set up an 
international peace force to take contras and leftist salvadoran 
rebels from its territory it said the rebels should be taken first 
to costa rica and guatemala then resettled elsewhere 
thursday in san jose the capital of costa rica assistant 
foreign minister carlos rivera rejected that proposal 
rivera told reporters relocating the contras in costa rica would 
violate that countrys principles of neutrality the only way the 
proposal could be considered would be for the rebels to abandon the 
war and become refugees or political exiles rivera said 
a rebel leader said thursday that some contras in honduras were 
returning to nicaragua enrique bermudez said in a telephone 
interview from miami that our troops are returning to their 
original positions inside nicaragua 
the report could not be immediately confirmed a rebel spokesman 
in tegucigalpa the honduran capital acknowledged some contra 
forces had returned to nicaraguan border provinces but declined to 
provide details the official spoke on condition of anonymity 
contras have used base camps on the honduran side of the border 
since they began fighting in 1981 to overthrow the sandinista 
government

organization of african unity called for an international 
conference on african debt during a meeting with president reagan 
thursday a us official said 
kenneth brown deputy assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs said moussa traore the president of mali told reagan 
that he wants to avoid a confrontation between debtors and 
creditors 
brown referred enquiries about the details of traores proposal 
to officials of mali at the embassy of mali an aide said all of 
the officials familiar with the proposal were with traore and could 
not be reached 
his party would have to speak primarily for him but he would 
like to see an international conference on african debt and made 
that known during the meeting brown said he wants to avoid a 
confrontation between debtors and creditors and thats why he was 
stressing this global approach 
brown said reagan and other us officials at the meeting 
discussed the us approach in terms of dealing with individual 
cases case by case and our interest in trying to encourage those 
who are serious about reforming their economy and not necessarily 
rewarding the worst performers 
brown said reagan expressed concern that libya which has been 
involved in war with chad in the western sahara is developing the 
capacity to produce chemical weapons he said the president 
emphasized the need for all of us to be vigilant in that regard 
the united states has previously expressed concern that libya 
has a plant that may be approaching capability to produce such 
weapons 
we have an interest therefore in an international approach to 
take mesures against the use of such weapons brown said 
the president proposed an international conference on the 
subject during his speech to the united nations general assembly 
last week 
in remarks at a welcoming ceremony on the south lawn of the 
white house reagan praised malis economic reform program which 
has made the impoverished west african nation a major african 
recipient of us economic aid 
since becoming chairman of the oau at the african summit in may 
he told traore you have already demonstrated your interest in 
helping to promote regional settlements in southern africa and the 
western sahara 
we hope the oau can play an even more active role in solving 
those regional problems and play a key role in promoting 
development in africa by encouraging economic reform and 
cooperation he said 
traore in his response said he was convinced that our 
discussions will enable us to make progress in the search for a 
solution to the problems which are of concern to both our sides 
as he posed for photographs with traore before their closed 
meeting reagan responded to a question about human rights in 
africa by saying i think we are sitting beside a man in whose 
country that is a major goal 
brown said the two leaders met privately for half an hour and 
then met in a larger group for an additional half hour 
at a state dinner for traore on thursday night reagan said he 
was gratified that you share our concern about regional stability 
and economic development in africa and added that the united 
states would continue to work with you and be as supportive as we 
can in these areas 
responding to the presidents toast traore speaking in french 
said through an interpreter that the oau would continue to seek 
the taking down of the intolerable system of apartheid in south 
africa he said also that it was urgent to find a just and

a texas company and two of its executives were 
accused thursday of participating with a postal service governor in 
a contract bidrigging scheme that included replacing the 
postmaster general 
the replacement of paul n carlin with albert v casey as 
postmaster general was engineered in 1986 as part of the elaborate 
effort by recognition equipment inc to get 400 million worth of 
contracts to provide automated mailsorting equipment according an 
indictment returned here 
the indictment charged that the company reis chairman william 
g moore jr and robert w reedy a vice president conspired with 
peter e voss then vice chairman of the postal service board of 
governors and others to manipulate bid procedures obtain 
confidential information about competitors and replace carlin 
considered an obstacle to rei winning contracts 
an unindicted coconspirator voss received 19000 in kickbacks 
plus 4000 worth of airline tickets from a detroitarea public 
relations firm headed by john r gnau jr that rei hired on voss 
recommendation the indictment said 
voss who received a fouryear sentence for his 1986 guilty plea 
in the case also was promised onequarter of one percent of any 
revenues rei earned from postal service contracts it said 
the indictment charged that through voss rei arranged for the 
postal service in 1985 to halt procurement of a multiline optical 
character reader system and set up a twostep test period to give 
it another chance to win the lucrative order 
after the procurement scheme came to light in 1986 the postal 
service ultimately decided to give the revised contract to 
electrocom automation inc which had beat out rei for the earlier 
phase of the contract 
but if rei had won the competition it would have been 
positioned to obtain procurement contracts worth 46 billion over 
the next five years said postal service spokesman james van loozen 
voss who headed president reagans 1980 ohio presidential 
campaign pleaded guilty to charges he took kickbacks totaling at 
least 30000 on four postal service contracts and expense account 
fraud 
gnau another unindicted coconspirator who headed reagans 1980 
michigan campaign received a threeyear sentence for conspiracy 
and for paying an illegal 2500 gratuity to voss 
gnau agreed to cooperate with the investigation along with 
another executive of his firm michael b marcus who received a 
sixmonth sentence for paying illegal gratuities to voss 
van loozen said the bid rigging scandal delayed procurement of a 
new optical mailscanner system for about 14 months the system is 
now expected to be completely installed next may 
in sentencing memos filed in the earlier cases prosecutors 
estimated that the bidrigging activities of voss and gnau cost the 
postal service hundreds of millions of dollars the agency planned 
to save through automation 
the indictment charged rei moore 49 and reedy 46 both of 
dallas with conspiracy to defraud the government theft of postal 
service property mail and wire fraud and aiding and abetting 
moore and reedy each face maximum possible prison terms of 33 
years and fines of more than 15 million if convicted the company 
could be fined more than 3 million if convicted 
rei spokeswoman jenny barker said neither the company nor mr 
moore nor mr reedy have done anything wrong we do not believe the 
indictment should have been brought by the us attorney 
the company mr moore and mr reedy intend to defend this 
matter to the fullest extent we are confident we will be 
exonerated she said 
in a statement us attorney jay b stevens said public 
corruption is one of democracys worst enemies this indictment 
represents our commitment to prosecute aggressively and vigorously 
those who seek to strike at the heart of fairness in the 
procurement process by corrupting the machinery of government for 
personal financial gain 
according to the indictment william a spartin president of 
gnau amp associates who also headed an executive placement firm 
influenced the selection of a new postmaster by obtaining 
management consulting contracts with the postal service 
spartin also named an unindicted coconspirator used his 
position to insinuate himself into the confidence of highlevel 
usps and board officials but concealed his relationship to voss 
gnau and rei 
casey who became postmaster general in january 1986 and served 
only seven months until early august 1986 was one of three 
candidates that spartin recommended through voss as a replacement 
for carlin 
spartin who concealed from casey his interest in reis effort 
to get a mailsorting contract also was instrumental in the 
removal of james v jellison a deputy postmaster general who was 
also regarded as an obstacle the indictment charged 
spartin is also cooperating with authorities in the 
investigation according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the procurement scheme began to unravel when some postal 
inspectors aboard a commercial airline noticed voss traveling in 
coach even though postal governors were allowed to fly first 
class sources said 
tracing his expense account vouchers inspectors discovered that 
voss had collected reimbursement for 70000 worth of firstclass 
air travel when he spent only 26000 on coach seats a prosecutor 
said when voss pleaded guilty to embezzlement 
casey was succeeded as postmaster general in august 1986 by new 
york businessman preston r tisch he held the job until anthony m 
frank a san francisco banker took over last march 1

irans foreign minister said thursday 
progress was made in recent iraniraq peace talks but he still 
accused iraq of balking on some issues and declined to comment on 
whether a compromise was near 
the iraqi delegation entered into substantive talks and modest 
progress has been made said ali akbar velayati after separate 
meetings in new york with the iraqi side and with secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
i cannot go into details but i can tell you the situation is 
better now than in the beginning he told a news conference 
asked about the release of us hostages held by proiranian 
extremists in lebanon he said i categorically deny there are 
any talks between the united states and iran and no talks on the 
hostage issue 
velayati said he was willing to resume talks in geneva with 
perez de cuellars representative and with iraq on oct 26 or oct 
27 if requested by the un chief iraq agreed to only one 
negotiating session in new york 
iraq and iran renewed peace talks saturday at un headquarters 
in new york after a session in geneva from aug 25 to sept 13 the 
talks followed a ceasefire aug 20 in the 8yearold war which 
left at least 1 million killed or wounded 
 
velyati emphasized he was not fully satisfied with the outcome 
of meetings with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz and blamed iraq 
for introducing what he called extraneous issues 
i am not altogether pleased or greatly encouraged in the pace 
of the talks velayati said he added that both sides have not 
yet been able to achieve the goals that the secretarygeneral had 
set 
these goals are formalization of the ceasefire withdrawal by 
both sides to international boundaries and repatriation of 
prisoners of war under terms of un security council resolution 
598 
velayati avoided a direct answer when asked if a compomise deal 
had been struck in which iran would halt searching neutral 
shipping in the gulf as reported by un sources 
in turn the sources said iraq would postpone discussion of 
sovereignty over the disputed shatt alarab waterway between the 
two nations 
un sources have reported that such a deal arranged by the 
secretarygeneral was virtually in place and could break the 
deadlock between the two sides over clearing of the shatt alarab 
sovereignty over the channel and other issues 
velayati did not deny a deal in the future but emphasized that 
for the time being iran would not give up its right to search 
suspect ships in time of war

while a state judge was ruling favorably in the 
divorce case of bess myersons lover the former miss america was 
calling the judge on an unlisted private line the judges former 
law clerk testified thursday 
miss myerson called more than a dozen times and gave an assumed 
name to court personnel the law clerk also testified at the 
divorcefixing trial of the two women and miss myersons lover 
carl andy capasso 
the capasso case was one of the few handled personally by the 
judge law clerk howard leventhal testified 
miss myerson capasso and state supreme court justice hortense 
gabel each face five counts of conspiracy mail fraud and 
briberelated charges in an alleged 1983 scheme to slash capassos 
child support and alimony payments 
in his second day of federal court testimony leventhal said 
that of more than 3000 requests to change alimony and child 
support payments the capasso case was one of the few mrs gabel 
handled personally 
i think ill do this one myself howie leventhal said the 
judge told him in july 1983 after capassos lawyer sought to delay 
weekly alimony and child support payments of 1850 a week to 
capassos wife nancy 
asked if mrs gabel had given similar personal attention to 
other support requests leventhal who was her law secretary from 
1981 until her resignation last year said maybe one or two 
prosecutors charge that miss myerson the citys former cultural 
affairs commissioner gave a 19000 city job to mrs gabels 
unemployed daughter sukhreet in order to influence the outcome of 
the judges decision 
leventhal the prosecutions second witness testified that in 
the summer of 1983 miss myerson began calling the judge on a 
private unlisted phone 
prosecutors contend that even though miss myerson and mrs gabel 
knew each other their contacts were limited until the judge began 
handling interim decisions in the capasso divorce 
leventhal also said miss myerson often called identifying 
herself either as barbara goodman or robinson 
leventhal said he didnt recognize the voice although the woman 
called a fairly large number of times between a dozen and two 
dozen 
the clerk said he asked mrs gabel who is this barbara 
goodman robinson person he said the judge replied oh thats 
bess myerson shes just being so byzantine 
on sept 14 1983 about a month after sukhreet gabel was made a 
special assistant to miss myerson the judge cut capassos 
temporary alimony and child support payments from 1850 to 680 a 
week 
when an oct 18 1983 new york post story reported the 
coincidence of ms gabels hiring by the cultural affairs 
department mrs gabel asked leventhal if she should withdraw from 
the capasso case 
i think it would be a good idea leventhal said he told the 
judge 
he said that mrs gabel had excused herself from other cases in 
the past where there had been a possible conflict of interest

resolution 435 passed a decade ago is a oneyear plan for 
national assembly elections under un supervision 
about 7500 un peacekeeping troops and 2000 civilian support 
staff are to be sent to namibia in an operation estimated to cost 
between 600 million and 700 million 
south africa has ruled the former german colony since world war 
i the united nations revoked a mandate from its predecessor the 
league of nations and declared pretorias rule over namibia 
illegal 
complicating the plan is south africas insistence that about 
50000 cuban troops stationed in angola to protect that countrys 
marxist government from the unita rebel movement should be 
withdrawn in a year unita stands for the national union for the 
total independence of angola 
the cubans have reportedly compromised their initial insistence 
on a fouryear withdrawal down to two years with a phased 
withdrawal away from southern angolas border with northern namibia 
officials involved in the talks among the united states angola 
cuba and south africa including us secretary of state george 
shultz have expressed confidence that a mutually acceptable 
compromise will be reached on the withdrawal timetable

a national science foundation official who 
helped set reagan administration policies regulating biology 
research said thursday he is resigning to resume research not 
because the justice department is investigating him for possible 
financial conflicts of interest 
david t kingsbury assistant director of the nsf for 
biological behavioral and social sciences for the last four years 
said he is resigning because i want to go back to the 
laboratory 
he confirmed that a justice department investigation of his 
financial interests is continuing but said thats not why ive 
resigned 
kingsbury formally leaves the nsf on oct 15 and assumes a new 
position as a full professor at george washington university on 
nov 1 he said the university job will include continuation of a 
research project that has been under way for several years and 
now is at a critical point 
in his letter of resignation dated sept 23 kingsbury said he 
was making the move to return to research and because of the 
stress on both the agency and me over the past year resulting from 
publicity about my activities outside nsf 
he acknowledged that he has been accused of having improper 
connections with biotechnology companies that could have been 
affected by nsf policies but denied that there is a conflict 
kingsbury said that shortly after his appointment to the nsf in 
1984 he submitted a list of his holdings to the nsf general 
counsel he said the counsel advised him to sell only one 
investment stock in the chiron corp of emeryville calif a 
biotechnology company the other holdings were not considered to be 
a conflict of interest he said 
some companies in which he holds stock have been incorrectly 
identified as biotechnology companies said kingsbury saying 
whether or not they are biotechnology companies is a matter of 
interpretation 
he identified one of his holdings as new brunswick scientific a 
company that he said makes laboratory equipment but does no 
biotechnology research 
kingsbury said he has hired an attorney to assist him in the 
continuing justice department probe but that the investigation 
started more than a year ago and nothing has come of it 
i have not been charged with any conflict of interest he 
said 
the nsf announced kingsburys resignation last week in a 
twoparagraph statement from erich bloch the nsf director 
in the statement bloch said the nsf would not comment on an 
investigation of kingsbury but did note that concerns have 
arisen and have been under consideration by the justice department 
concerning certain of dr kingsburys financial and business 
relationships especially with regard to financial disclosure 
kingsbury is a former university of california at berkeley 
researcher and a specialist in the genetics of brain ailments such 
as alzheimers disease at the nsf he has been a major influence 
on policies regulating the biotechnology industry during the reagan 
administration 
experts representing the environmental defense fund have charged 
that kingsbury helped formulate regulations that favored the 
biotechnology industry and genetic experiments 
kingsburys past history has been proindustry said rebecca 
goldburg an edf scientist she said kingsbury and the reagan 
administration were ineffective in setting policies regulating 
experiments using organisms that have been altered genetically in 
the laboratory

sen dan quayles answers to debate questions 
about what he would do if suddenly elevated to the presidency 
hardly dispelled doubts about his fitness for the no 2 job 
several political analysts said thursday 
they disagreed on whether quayles debate performance might have 
damaged the republican party ticket headed by george bush but they 
said the indiana senator clearly missed an opportunity to lay the 
fitness question to rest 
some of the experts including political consultants and 
political science professors said they felt the 41yearold 
quayle had been overcoached by his campaign handlers and was 
therefore too programmed to cope with nettlesome and unexpected 
questions 
if youve ever had a close friend have to give a toast or 
speech and just couldnt do it thats how i felt when i watched 
quayle struggle with hypothetical questions wednesday night about 
taking over the presidency because of an emergency said republican 
party consultant tom edmonds

members of john f kennedys inner circle 
enthusiastically agreed thursday with lloyd bentsen that dan quayle 
is no jack kennedy but they gave less support to the texas 
senators own claim of friendship with the late president 
lawrence f obrien who worked for kennedy in the 1960 
presidential campaign and later in the white house said he found 
quayles effort to compare himself to the late president both 
laughable and pathetic 
quayle can cite age family wealth years in congress and 
political ambition to support his claim that his experience is 
similar to kennedys when the massachusetts senator ran for 
president 28 years ago 
but when he drew the comparison during the vice presidential 
debate wednesday night bentsen quickly retorted 
i served with jack kennedy i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy 
was a friend of mine senator youre no jack kennedy

in what one official acknowledged was a 
startling change the defense department said thursday it has 
slashed the cost of the first phase of a star wars defensive shield 
from 115 billion to 69 billion and the system could be available 
within a decade 
but sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the figures should be viewed with some 
skepticism because the cost of weapons programs often goes down 
while they are in the planning stages and then rises when 
production starts 
the new figures arise from a restructuring of the strategic 
defense initiative the formal name of president reagans 
5yearold program to develop a hightech shield against attack by 
soviet nuclear missiles

four senators on thursday asked an independent 
committee to review safety and operations at the savannah river 
plant a south carolina facility that produces nuclear weapons 
material 
the plant run by ei du pont de nemours amp co under contract 
from the energy department has come under increasing scrutiny 
since disclosures last week that as many as 30 major mishaps there 
over three decades had not been reported to department headquarters 
or disclosed to the public 
the alleged questionable safety and operating procedures 
detailed in internal documents from du pont and the department 
continued until this august when the latest incident caused 
engineers to shut down the preactor at the plant the facilitys 
other two reactors also have been shut down 
we are very concerned about both the august 1988 incident at 
preactor and earlier incidents discussed in a recently disclosed 
1985 du pont memorandum said the letter signed by sens ernest

the justice department said thursday that an 
antidiscrimination law protecting the handicapped extends to 
employees with the aids virus if they are in the federal workforce 
or have jobs in programs receiving federal aid 
the opinion by the office of legal counsel is in line with a 
supreme court ruling last year and the civil rights restoration act 
of 1987 passed by congress 
the opinion also says that those with the aids virus in whom the 
disease has progressed can be excluded from the workplace if they 
pose a threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to 
their job 
since the available medical information shows that the risk of 
infection being transmitted in the normal course of the workplace 
is very low an aidsinfected employee by and large should be 
treated like any other employee assistant attorney general 
douglas kmiec head of olc said at a news conference where he 
discussed the opinion kmiec said an aidsinfected employee 
should be assessed for his ability to do the job like anyone 
else

medical waste

medical waste he said hundreds of those infected will 
ultimately die from the infection 
the bill approved 39028 would require the environmental 
protection agency to set up a system to track infectious or 
dangerous trash from hospitals labs and clinics to its disposal

regulations that took effect thursday forbidding 
future police officers and firefighters in massachusetts from 
smoking either on or off the job are producing resentment and 
expectations that the law will be challenged in court 
the law aimed at cutting health care and pension costs is the 
first of its kind in the nation some unions are calling it an 
unconstitutional intrusion into the private lives of public 
employees 
this is going to get jammed up in the courts probably the 
very first time they try to enforce it said lt edward m 
merrick jr a lobbyist for the 15000member massachusetts police 
association 
state legislators who drafted the law agree that it is likely to 
be challenged but they maintain it can pass constitutional muster 
because it affects only new recruits

starting thursday tomin had a job as a barroom philosopher 
noel reilly is paying the 49yearold thinker 8500 to give 
three lectures a year at his beehive pub in swindon 70 miles west 
of london 
tomin thinks the 100yearold pub is just the sort of place 
where socrates a poor man who went barefoot might have engaged in 
his philosophical dialogues in ancient athens 
the first talk by the bespectacled philosopher was a discourse

the work of dr robert xavier williams jr 
fills every playground every classroom and every mothers arms for 
miles around 
pick any woman and child on any street in macon or bullock 
counties in rural eastcentral alabama and chances are that woman 
was williams patient and that child was brought into the world by 
his hands 
in big cities expectant mothers shop for doctors or midwives 
and hospitals compete for maternity business but in rural america 
particularly the south and the west such choices are increasingly 
rare women often must travel for an hour or more for a doctors 
care and a hospital delivery room 
for 15 years robert xavier williams jr chose to do what fewer 
and fewer doctors are willing to do he delivered babies and cared 
for women in a piece of america where the need was acute the 
population poor and the facilities desperately limited 
he delivered the future here and his sudden death july 13 at 
the age of 53 turned that future darker and more uncertain for a 
generation of babies and their parents 
they want to know what do we do now annie thomas 
williams office nurse said of his legion of patients at least 
100 of whom are pregnant i just inform them we dont have a 
doctor in the office to see them and the saddest part of all we 
dont even have a referring physician to send them to 
in macon county where williams lived there is not even a 
hospital since john a andrew community hospital closed in 1987 
williams kept his office there the only doctor in a mostly empty 
building with an overgrown lawn but every day at dawn he drove 
along 25 miles of narrow highway to bullock county hospital to do 
his rounds 
after morning rounds williams often performed surgery then 
drove back to tuskegee for office hours six days a week with the 
office and the three county clinics where he consulted he might 
see 1500 patients a month and deliver an average of two babies a 
day 
at night williams unwound by reading medical journals he 
talked about retiring to a life of travel and golf but no one who 
knew him took him seriously 
he just worked worked worked nurse thomas said he 
wouldnt take time out to take a break or a rest or eat a decent 
lunch i think he cared more about his patients than he did 
himself i really do 
williams patients many already suffering the effects of poor 
nutrition high blood pressure or other conditions exacerbated by 
poverty needed extra care 90 percent were highrisk requiring 
special attention and sometimes frequent hospitalization throughout 
their pregnancies 
their risk status went handinhand with their economic status 
those with the greatest need often were the least able to pay most 
of them were uninsured or underinsured and could not afford a ride 
to his office much less an obstetricians bill 
try to pay me something if its not but a dollar a month 
hed tell his patients and they never were afraid to come to him 
no matter how little they had in their pocketbooks those who 
werent within walking distance were often ferried to appointments 
by williams son bobby who started working in his fathers office 
while in 7th grade 
the whole family helped wife rita worked as office manager 
bobby and daughters sherri rita and catherine ran errands and took 
patients blood pressure and weight behind their comfortable 
splitlevel house lay another part of williams life they all 
shared 10 acres of land where they kept horses cows and chickens 
and grew vegetables 
williams raised by his farmer grandfather arrived at tennessee 
state university with every intention of returning to the land 
instead he met and married rita took the medical aptitude tests 
as a lark and did well enough to be admitted to meharry medical 
college in nashville later he joined the air force serving at 
bases in grand forks nd and blytheville ark where he became 
the first black hospital commander 
his career was filled with honors but he never spoke of them 
all his patients knew was that he saved their lives and he saved 
their babies

in the nine months he worked at bullock county hospital its 
infant mortality rate dropped from 26 deaths per 1000 among the 
nations highest to 51 deaths half the national average 
if it wasnt for him i would be dead said pinkie thornton 
whose last three children and three grandchildren were delivered 
by williams her most recent pregnancy was ectopic a potentially 
lifethreatening condition in which the embryo develops outside the 
uterus in rare instances the pregnancy goes to term that is what 
happened to thornton whose daughter tari is now 5 
when the operation was over williams called in six doctors she 
recalled he was laughing and smiling he was kind of happy 
because he thought he was going to lose me or something every last 
one of the hospital staff members came in even the cooks out of 
the kitchen i woke up and said what are yall doing up here 
he said ms thornton you are going down in history 
it was not just the fact that williams was there to do what had 
to be done his patients say it was the way he did it 
when i had my daughter i had a very hard time gennell dix 
said i stayed in labor hard labor for 26 hours when it was 
over i woke up looking for dr williams you know how a little 
child says when mommy or daddy comes in it makes it all better 
thats the way it was with him he came in full of joy and a lot 
of times he embraced his patients 
bullock county stopped offering obstetrical services with 
williams death and stopped searching for a replacement on sept 
15 the task proved impossible said don priori who heads the 
hospital board 
every year 12 percent of obgyns stop delivering babies those 
who continue rarely choose to work in small towns with big 
problems twentynine of alabamas 67 counties have no obgyn 
the hospital looked for help to a federal program the national 
health service corps which gives scholarships to medical students 
who agree to serve in needy areas under the reagan administration 
however the programs budget has gone from 100 million in 1978 to 
2 million this year and the number of scholarships is down from 
more than 3000 to just 40 
bullock county which couldnt afford to wait even two months 
was told to wait another year the job of finding a replacement was 
complicated by the fact that williams literally did the work of two 
he was on call virtually 24 hours a day seven days a week 
said duane brookhart bullock county hospital administrator when 
an obstetrician looks at the types of need that exist theyre 
going to say i need some backup i need some days off i think 
that made it twice as difficult 
in the week before his death williams delivered 10 babies 
including two by caesarean section the last was a 7pound 
11ounce boy named aaron his own son now a thirdyear medical 
student at his fathers alma mater spent the summer working with 
him including the last 24 hours 
on tuesday he had a delivery a d and c and a csection 
then he did his rounds in surgery we went to the office and then 
he stayed at the hospital until 9 pm bobby said 
williams drove home and bobby stayed overnight in the 
hospitals oncall room his father awakened him at 6 the next 
morning to do rounds before the elder williams performed a 
hysterectomy 
i was in surgery with him bobby said he said im 
dizzy he slumped forward they started cardiac resuscitation 
that was one of the worst feelings i have ever had in my 
life he said i felt helpless 
another doctor judy jehle was flown in by emergency helicopter 
from a montgomery hospital to complete the surgery jehle had 
recently cut obstetrics out of her own practice because of the long 
hours 
at the funeral more than 1000 people crowded into the church 
many more went to the funeral home their children in tow 
one lady picked up her baby and said this is dr williams 
this is who delivered you dix said she had a picture taken 
she didnt ever want to forget him

whos elvira shes mae west morticia addams 
and cassandra peterson caught up in a cuisinart 
whos cassandra peterson shes elvira 
elvira was always elvira i was always cassandra now the line 
is kind of blurring sometimes i dont know who i am says 
peterson the host of a horror movie series whos just made her 
first movie elvira mistress of the dark 
elvira becomes like my real self which i try to do sometimes 
i become like elvira i throw elviraisms into what i do and say 
depending on my mood 
most of those elviraisms are unprintable they go far beyond 
beulah peel me a grape 
people say i have a lot in common with mae west peterson 
said i was a never a big fan of hers but i can certainly now see 
the common thread were both kind of the bad gal with a heart of 
gold character lots of double entendres 
they also share a similar anatomy peterson is well endowed 
for the uninitiated elvira is the host of movie macabre 
broadcast locally in los angeles her fame quickly grew moving 
beyond talk show appearances and commercials into a fan club and 
marketing windfall with elvira records greeting cards tshirts 
comic books and key chains peterson developed her alter ego seven 
years ago 
i thought the movie would be a great idea for this 
character peterson said the film companies didnt think i had 
enough nationwide appeal but then i got spots on johnny carson and 
bob hope 
once i became national nbc saw the potential and signed me 
up 
as for peterson she is quite unlike her alter ego she has long 
red hair and dressed very simply in jeans and a leotard shirt for a 
recent interview she is married to mark pierson her manager 
elvira was born cassandra peterson in colorado springs colo 
and had the good fortune to have a mother who owned a costume shop 
i dressed up all the time i would dress like miss kitty from 
gunsmoke my aunt sent me this funny picture of me as a witch 
when i was 5 years old ive got on a black wig and a witch dress 
i look like a 5yearold elvira she said 
her love for switching costumes and identities did not equip her 
for the stage in fact she flunked her high school drama class 
i was playing in our town i kept telling jokes making 
funny faces i got kicked out of the part i was the class clown i 
was making a farce of it she said 
our town was never for peterson viva las vagas is more 
her style in fact in the 1960s when she was 17 she worked as a 
las vegas showgirl 
i try to keep it really campy she said the film company 
thinks it a mens cult its straight camp its a very 
selfdepreciating character its all a kind of setup some people 
dont get it and some do 
its like being a cartoon character its like a male peewee 
herman a walking cartoon 
her costume and alter ego allow her a certain amount of privacy 
she says 
that is one of the great things im the worlds luckiest 
celebrity if i want to put on no makeup and put on curlers and go 
walking down hollywood boulevard nobody will know its me 
peterson said 
however fame caught up to her last month when maila vampire 
nurmi a former horror hostess filed a 10 million suit in us 
district court in los angeles claiming she had developed the 
elvira character in the 1950s before peterson 
horror hostesses are all wearing just about the same outfit 
peterson said youve got pretty slim parameters mine were that 
i had to be in black and had to have black hair and look sexy any 
similarity is purely coincidental if someone told you to look like 
dracula what would you wear 
but elvira isnt just a black dress and wig its a whole other 
person 
i always compare it to someone at a costume party if youre 
in a total disguise you kind of go wild nobody knows who you are 
you might do things you otherwise wouldnt do they suddenly become 
these wild animals when i put on this costume and wig i become 
this wild underside of my character

al franken was trailing the candidates with a 
satellite dish on his head dana carvey and kevin nealon were 
austrian weightlifters hans and franz we want to pomp you op 
dan aykroyd made a surprise appearance as bob dole 
nbcs saturday night live had just hit stride last spring 
when the writers guild strike brought everything to a halt 
executive producer lorne michaels hopes to get back on track 
soon the show begins its 14th season saturday but laments 
missing seven shows that would have culminated in a nostalgic 
seasonender with gilda radner and bob dylan 
if there had been a strike in 1985 i wouldnt have minded it 
so much said michaels in an interview in his nbc office but 
we were in such good rhythm our ratings were going up every week 
i just thought we were doing very good work it was an election 
year the writing was there the cast was there 
michaels launched the show in 1975 and with it the careers of 
radner aykroyd chevy chase john belushi jane curtin and bill 
murray michaels left in 1980 to produce movies but returned in 
1985 a rushedtogether cast spent an unhappy season under 
crushingly negative reviews 
in 1986 the show rebounded with a new cast that has remained 
intact for three seasons this group seems to have shaken off the 
ghosts of the nowfabled originals 
aykroyd played dole off nora dunns edgeofhysteria takeoff on 
congresswoman pat schroeder dana carvey did a brilliant robin 
williams opposite williams himself as his own father phil 
hartman who can do everybody from jimmy swaggart to phil donahue 
perfected barbara bush 
michaels said he had felt out of touch with the latenight 
audience when he came back in 1985 and unwisely heeded advice to 
target the show to some nebulous notion of a new and younger 
audience 
and so you start putting on stuff you dont think is funny or 
that youre not comfortable with or a musical group that happens to 
be hot at that moment booking from the charts instead of from your 
tastes he said and its disorienting because if you fail 
that way as i did you go well wheres the satisfaction theres 
no satisfaction so after that season i went back to im going to 
put on the things that i think are good and hopefully im not that 
out of step 
michaels 43 now oversees a staff of writers who in some cases 
were in junior high school when snl premiered 
you know theres a certain point where youre sitting in a 
room and its 2 oclock in the morning and youre saying i 
dont think it will work words that as you hear them coming out 
of your head you realize these people and sometimes those people 
are 25 or 26 and theyre looking at you and you think theyre 
thinking hes old and annoying and you know that you think it 
wont work because you wrote it three times you produced it eight 
times and it didnt work any of the 11 times theyre thinking 
he just doesnt get it 
michaels produced the emmy awards show for fox this summer 
livening up the proceedings and keeping the show mercifully short 
he says its an experience he feels he needs only only once in his 
life though 
now besides shepherding snl he is helping launch two new shows 
sunday night a variety show that premiered on nbc last 
sunday will feature an eclectic assemblage of musical guests 
david sanborn and jools holland are cohosts comedian kevin meany 
is a regular 
kids in the hall an hbo series featuring a young comedy 
troupe from michaels home town of toronto 
there is a time in peoples careers which is more interesting 
for me to be working with them to watch people come into their

earlier in the day at an nbc press conference about the new 
season of saturday night live michaels was asked what was new 
to say after 14 years

children around the world have played 
with springy slinkies for 43 years but the 70yearold woman who 
helped invent the wire toy says it hasnt been all fun and games 
betty james president of james industries inc says her late 
husband richard james a mechanical engineer and naval architect 
came up with the idea of the toy in 1943 while aboard a ship he 
saw a torsion spring fall from a table and bounce 
mrs james took control of the business in 1960 when her 
husband lost interest and left the family to join what she called a 
religious cult in bolivia he died there in 1974 
to this day she said i dont know what a torsion spring 
is 
james industries is a spartan nononsense firm that turns out 
slinkies by the millions in this small central pennsylvania town 
it employs 120 people who manufacture package sell and ship 
slinkies from a single building 
a grandmother of 10 mrs james says shes basically a doting 
mother devoted to her six adult children and their families 
according to her oldest son shes also a demanding and assertive 
boss 
she expects a lot out of you she expects you to produce and 
so you do produce said richard james ii 46 he is slinky sales 
manager and the only one of three sons and three daughters to join 
the family business 
mrs james who is known as big betty is not too big to 
take telephone messages for her staff and do many other tasks 
when we first moved into this building i used to clean the 
toilets too she said 
shes been involved in every aspect of production and promotion 
slinky was put on the market in 1945 after the jameses spent 
two years experimenting with various types of steel 
after receiving a patent they demonstrated the toys at a 
gimbels department store in philadelphia they gave us the end 
of a counter so we could show how it walked mrs james recalled 
i was so scared that no one would buy them i called a friend 
and asked her to come along i thought we would each buy one if 
nobody else did she said 
she neednt have worried after a quick demonstration the first 
400 slinkies sold out in 90 minutes at a dollar each 
i was so taken aback when i saw this crowd of people and 
everyone was waving dollar bills 
each night mrs james took the days production home from the 
manufacturer and wrapped the slinkies by hand with yellow paper 
richard james meanwhile came up with other inventions but 
none were successful 
he was a dreamer she said he developed a refrigerator 
that would dispense soft drinks but we took it out because we were 
drinking so many soft drinks we were getting fat he also wanted to 
work on an amphibious car 
when her husband left mrs james struggled to keep the business 
alive to feed herself and her children 
to me my family is the most precious thing in life i 
always wanted a family because i was an only child she said 
you do what you have to do for them i did what i had to do 
the first slinky plant was in philadelphias germantown section 
mrs james moved to hollidaysburg 180 miles away 23 years ago 
because she had family and friends in the area who could help care 
for her children 
the family moved a year and a half before the companys move was 
complete and mrs james commuted to philadelphia each week she 
drove to philadelphia on sunday evenings returning home on 
thursdays 
it was hard to see her crying because she had to leave the six 
of us her son richard said 
today james industries sells millions of slinkies around the 
world mrs james who with her children owns all company stock 
declined to release the number of units sold annually or annual 
sales figures slinkies usually retail for less than 2 
the company produces other toys including building blocks 
plastic rings games and pin wheels but slinky outsells them 
all mrs james said 
its simple its a universal toy its a toy that doesnt 
need any explanation it has intrinsic play value her son said 
there are very few other toys like that 
james industries began producing brightly colored plastic 
slinkies in 1979 to appeal to younger children especially infants 
mrs james and her son gasp at the thought of updating the 
television commercial jingle that declares slinky slinky 
everyone loves a slinky the song was written in 1963 
well just stick to something thats good she said

the cost of health care is rising sharply again 
and among the reasons why incredibly is the success of past 
costcontainment efforts 
yes you read it correctly 
this seemingly illogical almost impossible state of affairs 
cost cutting leading to inflation illustrates the pernicious 
financial nature of the healthcare beast which avoids the most 
carefully laid antiinflation traps 
the origins of the latest price spurt go back to the early and 
mid1980s when you might recall healthcare officials in every 
area of the industry felt drastic measures were required 
at that time according to a consultant on corporate benefits 
the william m mercermeidingerhansen concern many state medicaid 
programs privatesector benefit plans and medicare tackled costs 
with a vengeance 
among other things they implemented casebased hospital 
reimbursement systems set up hospital utilization review programs 
and shifted costs from employers to employees dispensers and users 
of services therefore would be put on the side of cost 
containment it would be in their financial interest 
it worked hospital utilization and occupancy rates fell 
while that might seem to be a positive result it wasnt 
entirely so the reason to hospitals each dollar saved through 
cost containment was a revenue dollar lost to correct it they had 
to cut expenses or rebuild revenues 
cutting expenses can appear easier than it is for example 
hospitals have many fixed costs for plant and equipment that do no 
decline as occupancy rates fall the situation can force 
administrators to seek higher revenues 
the most frustrating illustration of this according to the 
consulting firms report is in ambulatory surgery 
in designing costcontainment strategies many sponsors of 
health insurance plans identified hospital surgical procedures that 
could be performed safely in an outpatient surgical facility 
these sponsors began to encourage workers to have certain types 
of surgery performed on an outpatient basis thus saving the cost 
of a oneday or twoday hospital stay employees were offered 
financial incentives to do so 
now says mercermeidingerhansen these corporate sponsors are 
finding that outpatient facility charges are as high as 3000 for 
as little as a few hours use 
ironically it states in many instances plan costs would 
actually be reduced if these surgeries were again performed in the 
hospital since the cost of one day there can be less expensive 
than the surgical facility charge 
this is just one illustration of the difficulties involved in 
holding the line on health care costs there are plenty of other 
reasons including the changing natures of health and illness 
themselves 
aids for instance was not a cost factor until relatively 
recently now the centers for disease control estimates that total 
expenses for one patient might be as high as 150000 between 
diagnosis and death 
other cost problems involve the increasing price of medical 
education an investment that must be recovered the surging cost 
of certain malpractice insurance and the defensive medical tests 
and procedures now being used 
but much of the inflation problems lie within the nature of the 
industry itself putting a dollar cost on life remains one of mans 
most difficult challenges one from which even the most hardnosed 
executives retreat 
meanwhile many companies and others who sponsor health 
insurance plans are confronted with enormous increases in their 
bills 
while the economy in general worries about 45 percent 
inflation the consulting firms report states that many plan 
sponsors have seen their bills rise this year by 30 percent to 80 
percent

the president sukarno who died in 
disgrace 18 years ago is again stirring controversy in the nation 
he led to independence from the dutch after world war ii 
two recently published books spotlight the leader whose vivid 
personality has an almost mythic hold on many indonesians who refer 
to themselves as sukarnoists 
in the memoirs of col bambang widjanarko his military aide 
from 1960 to 1968 sukarno is portrayed as helplessly buffeted by 
political forces beyond his control during an aborted communist 
coup sept 30 1965 
some critics complained that bambangs eight years near 
sukarno glosses over sukarnos shortcomings but it is the less 
controversial of the two books 
the other book in the view of sukarnoists should be banned for 
blackening the reputation of the nations cofounder 
it is titled he who sows the wind will reap the storm and 
says sukarno was involved in the aborted coup and was a committed 
marxist since his student days in the 1920s 
written by sugiarso surojo a former intelligence officer who 
now edits a womens magazine he who sows describes sukarno as 
a conspirator adept at concealing his true identity 
charges of complicity in the uprising in which six top army 
generals were slain are not new several military tribunals heard 
testimony years ago that sukarno knew the coup was planned but did 
nothing to prevent it 
earlier foes also denounced what they saw as his demogoguery 
hedonistic lifestyle and tilt toward the communist party which is 
now banned 
sukarno remained as president in name only after signing over 
power on march 11 1966 to maj gen suharto who foiled the 
revolt five months earlier sukarno and suharto who is now 66 are 
the only presidents this country has known 
sugiarso said he was inspired to write his book partly by the 
revival of sukarnoism during last years general election campaign 
thousands of young indonesians in red tshirts and headbands 
thronged rallies in support of the indonesian democratic party a 
grouping of five political parties one of which was founded by 
sukarno 61 years ago the party had been faring poorly and its 
leaders calculated correctly that the sukarno magnetism would help 
revive its fortunes 
with megawati sukarno one of sukarnos daughters among the 
successful candidates last year the party increased its 
representation in the 500seat parliament from 24 to 40 members and 
its proportion of the total vote from 79 to 11 percent 
with sukarnoism making a comeback among youth sugiarso said 
his book is intended to balance what he called a lopsided view of 
history fostered by the countrys founding generation 
the time has come for our national history to be straightened 
written objectively so as to be a mirror for our future leaders 
and for the young generation who have not known their true national 
history he said 
attorney general sukarton marmosudjono described the book as 
unethical but rejected calls to ban it home affairs minister 
rudini also objected to the book and lt gen harsudiono hartas 
chief of the armed forces social and political section urged a 
stop to the sukarno polemic 
no sales figures were available but booksellers said it was 
moving briskly 
sukarno was officially forgotten and rarely mentioned favorably 
in ruling circles after his death at the age of 69 from a kidney 
ailment june 21 1970 
once hailed for his vision of a unified nation free of dutch 
colonial rule his economic policies had virtually bankrupted 
indonesia 
popular interest in sukarno was reignited after the government 
decided in 1979 to build an elaborate tomb for his remains 
replacing a simple grave that was covered by a faded yellow parasol 
newspapers were allowed for the first time in years to mention 
his name portraits of sukarno went on sale and a twoweek exhibit 
of memorabilia attracted throngs books he wrote books came off the 
banned list 
statues of sukarno and the countrys first vice president and 
cofounder mohammad hatta were dedicated in 1980 at the site 
where they declared independence on aug 17 1945 hatta resigned 
in 1956 partly as a result of disenchantment with sukarnos 
leadership and died in 1980 
jakartas efficient new airport was renamed the sukarnohatta 
international airport three years ago 
the son of a schoolteacher and a balinese dancer sukarno became 
one of the best known nationalists in what then was the netherlands 
east indies after forming a political party in 1927 the dutch 
sentenced him to four years in prison in 1929 
freed in 1931 he was arrested again the following year and 
spent the next eight years in exile in the outer islands his exile 
ended when the japanese invaded during world war ii and freed him 
some indonesians accused him of collaborating with the japanese 
following their declaration of independence in 1945 sukarno and 
hatta raised an army and and took to the jungle for a fouryear 
struggle against the dutch 
although the dutch captured and again exiled sukarno in 1948 
his battle for independence stirred world opinion and the united 
nations urged freedom for the nation sukarno was freed in 1949 and 
later that year the dutch relinquished power

becky london never answered the call 
of the wild and rarely got the attention she craved from her famous 
father 
but despite a somewhat sheltered childhood and unremarkable 
life she remains a striking link to jack london a man whose tales 
of struggles for survival made him one of americas most beloved 
authors 
if london were alive today hed enjoy spinning yarns with his 
only surviving child becky 85 has a few of her own many about 
the man she still lovingly refers to as daddy 
talking with becky is like having a chat with her father 
says russ kingman a london expert and a friend of the writers 
daughter even her letters read like a jack london story 
bess becky london fleming has never been one to take 
advantage of her fathers fame she says but recently shes 
immersed herself in her roots 
she began using her maiden name after her husband died in 1982 
most of her life has been spent in oakland the authors home city 
for years six years ago she moved north into an apartment annex of 
the jack london bookstore in the valley of the moon 
occasionally she visits the nearby ranch now a state 
historical park where the writer was living when he died in 1916 
she also has made public appearances and lectures and cheerfully 
obliges with anecdotes about him for visitors to her home 
decorated with pictures of cats dogs and her father along with 
his books the call of the wild the sea wolf white 
fang 
it is a fitting devotion for a woman who says proudly that her 
paternal connection is still the greatest thing that ever happened 
to her 
with her round face and engaging personality becky is almost 
a clone of her father according to kingman who runs the 
bookstore in this idyllic sonoma county community 
she has the same love for other people the same knack for 
making other people feel that theyre important the same bubbly 
personality 
both becky and her sister joan were products of londons first 
marriage to bess maddern they were divorced when becky was a year 
old and her jealous mother never allowed her to visit her father 
at the ranch with his second wife charmian 
kingman says joan who wrote a biography of london and worked 
for the aflcio for 30 years before dying in 1972 was the authors 
favorite daughter becky who adored him only had one full day 
with him by herself when joan was sick becky was only 14 when he 
died 
otherwise becky was the caboose says kingman he never 
had time for her its a tragedy 
though she wishes they could have spent more time together 
there is no trace of bitterness to her voice 
he still is my model of what a father ought to be becky 
london says of course he was human he had his faults 
among her memories are numerous outings the writer had with his 
two daughters 
he used to take us to an amusement park in oakland she 
recalls we went to san francisco with him when we were older 
taking the train the ferry boat and the cable cars oh how daddy 
loved cable cars 
her father didnt talk a lot about himself with his daughters 
preferring to focus on their lives she says it wasnt until she 
was about 10 when she was dusting a bookcase and pulled out book 
after book hed written that she discovered he was famous 
i still remember how dumbfounded i was she says shaking 
her head 
but the public was aware of his fame it was thrilling to go 
out with daddy because everybody knew him and he was always so 
gracious to them she said 
daddy bought us taffy candy and wed walk up market street and 
everybody in the city it seemed would stop and talk to him 
sailors hobos businessmen wearing silk hats ladies in carriages 
boxers he knew them all i was so proud sometimes hed shake 
hands and leave them a 5 gold piece 
he also took personal charge of the girls education sending 
them a trunkful of books to read every year stories about heroes 
were a frequent choice along with history books 
today becky london has lost her treasured ability to read 
because of deteriorating eyesight she spends much of her time 
chatting with friends listening to baseball games on the radio 
shes a big fan of the oakland athletics and san francisco giants 
and savoring positive memories 
i was born an optimist she says i dont worry im happy 
all the time

hunched over slightly aaron miller steadies his 
22caliber pistol and fires blowing peasized holes in a targets 
black bulls eye the 10yearold is probably as good a shot as any 
at a popular suburban shooting range 
but theres another side of the story about children and 
firearms especially in florida where the legislature recently 
made it easier for residents to buy and carry sidearms 
in dade county alone 37 youths 18 years old and under have been 
fatally shot this year 13 more than in all of 1987 according to 
the medical examiners office 
just this summer the body of a 14yearold boy was hidden for 
10 days by three young brothers in st petersburg who panicked when 
a shotgun they were playing with accidentally discharged a 
14yearold boy was accidentally shot to death by his older brother 
in the farming town of pahokee an 11yearold boy shot in the head 
by a playmate remains hospitalized in tampa 
and an 11yearold miami boy was shot and killed during a 
socalled game of courage three friends were charged with 
manslaughter 
police blame the tragedies on improperly stored weapons peer 
pressure television violence and irresponsible adults they also 
cite relaxed state gun laws that have increased the number of 
firearms in some communities 
were too gunhappy says veteran metrodade homicide lt 
mike gonzalez there are so many guns lying around in peoples 
homes and cars that naturally kids are going to get into them 
some children such as aaron get gun safety instruction at home 
but those killed and wounded often have little or no knowledge of 
firearms 
as part of a national effort the national rifle association has 
proposed a program in florida elementary schools focusing on gun 
safety 
although state education commissioner betty castor has flatly 
rejected the idea some school districts including dade county 
are looking at some form of gun education 
schools could help counter the feeling among many youths that 
guns are cool said steve morris an educator at a school where 
a miami youth was recently slain with a handgun 
we need to give more information on handguns not how to use 
them but the dangers involved said morris assistant principal 
of glades junior high school where seventh grader marcus mayorga 
had just started summer school when he was killed 
maybe they need to see a picture of someone with their head 
blown up he suggested acknowledging that may be too graphic 
we need to show them the final outcome the anguish caused to 
parents and friends 
marcus and some friends got together july 12 unsupervised at 
the home of a girl who had found the gun earlier under a dresser 
and they devised a russian roulettestyle game to test each others 
courage 
the game involved distracting the victim while one of them 
unloaded the gun according to metrodade det john butchko 
tragically when marcus was playing the victim the gun remained 
loaded he was killed instantly 
three teens now face manslaughter charges and will be tried in 
juvenile court butchko said 
deadly games of chance killed three other miami youths ages 
14 16 and 18 this year in separate incidents according to the 
medical examiners office 
its amazing there havent been more cases like that said 
detective gonzalez 
the problem is not unique to florida of course nationwide 328 
youths 19 years old and under were killed by firearms in 1985 the 
latest year for which figures are available according to the 
marylandbased national center for health statistics 
gonzalez morris and floridas nra spokeswoman marion hammer 
believe that television violence may have a role in encouraging 
children to glamorize guns and not treat them seriously 
i think tv to a great extent is responsible because a lot of 
children know absolutely nothing about guns other than what they 
see on tv and those are the wrong things said ms hammer 
the level of violence consumed by the average child appears to 
have increased in recent years with more movies available on 
videocassette and cable television said dr thomas redecki 
research director for the private national coalition on television 
violence he estimated that the average child in the united states 
by age 18 will witness on tv 32000 murders 40000 attempted 
murders and 225000 acts of violence 
the nra is pushing for an elementarylevel gun safety program 
that would focus on the concept of no go tell that is if a 
youngster sees a gun neither to pick it up nor to get near someone 
handling it but to tell an adult about it 
regardless of where you stand philosophically on the issue 
the common ground upon which we must all stand is the safety and 
protection of children ms hammer insists 
david voss spokesman for the state education commissioner said 
his boss simply does not feel it is the schools responsibility 
to teach about guns she also is against any sort of statemandated 
program regardless of what you think about the issue schools have 
all they can handle now 
voss didnt know of any districts considering firearms 
education and ms hammer said she could not identify those which 
she said had expressed an interest in the nra proposal or something 
similar 
dade county however has a committee studying the issue 
i think were treading on some dangerous ground we know 
its a critical issue but its incumbent upon us to carefully 
plan said gloria mcphee executive director of general and basic 
skills education for the county she said the likely target of gun 
safety information would be parents who could in turn discuss the 
issue with their children 
tenyearold aaron who goes to the shooting range every few 
weeks isnt so sure that talking to kids in school about guns will 
help stop them from getting hurt 
he said his father who accompanies him on the outings has 
taught him well about firearm safety but not all people have as 
good a father 
reciting his no 1 safety rule he said as far as im 
concerned every gun is loaded

some people are betting that the devastating 
drought of 1988 is over that next year will see a return to 
normalcy in us crop production after all they say thats been 
the historical pattern 
there were helpful rains the last couple of months and the crop 
growing season has virtually ended so there is less news about the 
drought although in huge areas of the nation dryness still 
prevails the deep subsoil kind that will require a foot or two of 
precipitation to remedy 
all in all say agriculture department economists most farmers 
and ranchers have survived the crop and pasture losses better than 
some thought possible at midyear when heat and drought were so 
rampant 
one important note of optimism came recently from the 
departments economic research service drought temporarily slowed 
the recovery in farmland values but appraisers think land prices 
will climb at a healthy clip in 1989 
land prices primarily reflect longterm expectations for farm 
income interest rates and other factors says agency economist 
roger hexem but shortterm events such as the drought can reduce 
farmers liquidity which in turn reduces the demand for farmland 
or increases supply of land on the market if farms fail 
a survey of rural appraisers in august indicated that farmland 
prices nationwide rose 12 percent from may 1 to the end of july 
slightly behind the 18 percent increase for the preceding three 
months looking to this fall the appraisers said they expected 
land values to rise an average of only 09 percent from aug 1 
through october 
but they also indicated farmland values may rise 46 percent in 
1989 faster than a 36 percent increase forecast last may prior to 
the main drought impact 
if the inflation rate continues to edge upward farmland 
values may improve hexem said however wariness about next 
years growing conditions farm incomes and interest rates seem to 
be dampening the nearterm outlook particularly in areas where the 
drought has been most severe 
by reducing grain output driving up commodity prices and 
putting livestock producers in a bind for forage and emergency feed 
supplies the drought took a further toll of producers who had 
suffered the financial crunch of earlier years 
there likely wont be as many farms next year as there would 
have been without the 1988 drought says another agency 
economist clark edwards in the october issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine 
drought he said created financial hardships that have 
accelerated many of the forces that were already leading to fewer 
but larger farms in the united states 
this consolidation or decline in farm numbers occurred rapidly 
averaging almost 3 percent a year after the peak in 1935 of 
681 million farms then in the early 1970s exploding export 
markets made farming financially attractive 
according to the 1982 census of agriculture edwards said the 
number of farms in the preceding decade declined only 04 percent a 
year 
in the early 1980s as lower commodity prices and rising 
interest rates squeezed producers profits from farmland dropped 
and so did land values farm numbers declined again and 
consolidations increased 
farmers hurt most by the drought are offering land for sale or 
rent in sufficient numbers to slow the rise in land values that 
began last year following six years of decline edwards said 
this lowers the price of land relative to its value leading to 
further consolidations by farmers with growth potential 
but the drought is causing consolidation differently according 
to region in winter wheat areas of the southern great plains 
yields were high this year and with rising market prices the 
consolidation would be somewhat like that experienced in boom 
times including a slowing in the rate of exit from farming he 
said 
but for farmers growing spring wheat in the northern plains 
production was down by half incomes were cut and the 
consolidation would be more like that experienced during bust 
times edwards said 
urbanization conversion to nonfarm uses rising transportation 
costs and expenses associated with new technologies are some other 
factors that affect farmland consolidation 
edwards said a number of factors are working against the 
tendency to farm consolidation including 
selling off parcels of land for city growth can result in a 
larger number of small farms 
nonfarm incomes help ensure survival of smaller farm 
operations including parttime and hobby farms 
some farms that produce specialty commodities appear small by 
some measures but are proving profitable and durable 
larger farms sometimes reach a size beyond which they can grow 
no more and may even break up into smaller farms census 
information shows that large farms are just as likely to break 
into small ones as small farms are to blossom into large ones

one of corporate americas longest and most 
bitterly contested takeover battles is nearing an end with irving 
bank corps top management accepting a sweetened 14 billion 
offer from rival bank of new york co 
the announcement wednesday came one day after irving lost a key 
court battle on its antitakeover poison pill defense 
irving chairman joseph a rice said he would recommend the board 
of directors approve the merger and drop all pending lawsuits and 
antitakeover defenses used to ward off bank of new yorks 
yearlong advances 
he also promised to move up his retirement plans and leave after 
the deal was completed 
a special board meeting was set for friday although many 
banking experts have called the vote a formality 
were 99 percent there i believe the board will go along with 
rice said virginia adair a banking analyst with drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
under the revised bid bank of new york would pay 15 in cash 
and 1675 shares of its own stock for each of irvings 189 million 
common shares outstanding it also included warrants valued at 5 a 
share toward the purchase of bank of new york stock 
the entire deal would be worth about 76 a share or around 14 
billion about 200 million higher than the hostile offer the 
previous bid had the same amount of cash but slightly less stock 
and did not include the warrants 
irving shares jumped 375 to close at 7350 on the new york 
stock exchange while bank of new york fell 75 cents to 3412 
neither side would comment on the turn of events leading to the 
tentative pact but banking analysts agreed irving was forced to 
negotiate with its unwanted suitor after losing tuesdays court 
rulings and in the absence of any friendly white knight 
takeover partner 
the appellate division of the new york state supreme court on 
tuesday struck down a key provision of irvings poison pill 
antitakeover defense 
the defense would have allowed all irving shareholders except a 
hostile suitor to buy 400 worth of irving shares for 200 if any 
suitor bought more than 20 percent of irving stock without the 
support of irvings management the plan was intended to make a 
hostile takeover bids prohibitively expensive 
irving had vowed to appeal the ruling to the states court of 
appeals but some legal experts questioned whether that court would 
have considered the case since the appellate divisions decision 
was unanimous 
the court ruling closed down one of their last possible escape 
routes said mark lynch an analyst with bear stearns amp co 
they had very few options left 
last spring milanbased banca commerciale italiana spa offered 
to merge with irving as part of a major restructuring of the new 
york bank but it recently withdrew its bid after the federal 
reserve board ruled the italian government agency that owned most 
of banca commerciale had to supply separate financial imformation 
the fed already has given conditional approval for an 
irvingbank of new york merger 
a merger would nearly double bank of new yorks size vaulting 
it close to the top 10 of the nations largest banking companies 
the two had a combined 478 billion in assets as of june 30 
bank of new york which owns 49 percent of irving had 
maintained since unveiling its takeover proposal on sept 25 1987 
that a merger would be a good fit because both banks have similar 
markets and services while many analysts agreed they also 
speculated bank of new york might have feared it would become a 
takeover target if a big west coast or foreign bank decided to 
enter the new york market 
drexels ms adair said she expected bank of new york to proceed 
with the strategy it proposed at the start that includes selling 
some of irvings assets reducing irvings third world debt 
portfolio and consolidating facilities 
michael starr an analyst with duff amp phelps said one thing 
the bank of new york is going to have to do is reaffirm client 
relationships 
they paid dearly for it a merger in both cost and disruption 
both companies have incurred starr said 
according to the merger proposal all present directors of 
irving would be invited to join bank of new yorks board of 
directors and all key personnel decisions would be made by a 
committee of directors made up of three directors of the bank of 
new york and two current irving directors 
if irvings board backs rice irving also would drop its poison 
pill and waive a new york state antitakeover law that prevents an 
unfriendly merger for at least five years 
when the bid was first made it had the distinction of being the 
first hostile takeover fight between major american banks it then 
became the lengthiest such battle among major us corporations

the marathon fight for macmillan inc appears 
headed toward a showdown next week in court 
the publishing giants board as expected urged shareholders 
wednesday to reject a 251 billion tender offer from british 
publisher robert maxwell 
macmillan previously agreed to a 25 billion buyout proposal 
from a group led by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co and including macmillan senior management 
macmillan stock rose 25 cents a share to 8862 in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading that was slightly below kohlbergs 
latest offer of 9005 in cash and securities for each of 
macmillans 278 million shares maxwells latest offer is 9025 a 
share in cash 
i dont think the rejection makes much difference said j 
kendrick noble a media analyst for the investment firm painewebber 
inc a recommendation from the board cant stop an alternative 
bid 
noble said the key issue now is in the courts 
maxwells tender offer is set to expire oct 13 while 
kohlbergs offer expires 24 hours later 
maxwell already had filed suit in chancery court in delaware 
charging that the bidding process was unfairly skewed in favor of 
the management bid a hearing on the complaint was scheduled for 
monday 
macmillan said its board decided to recommend that shareholders 
reject maxwells offer because it contained several conditions 
including invalidation of the legal and binding contractual 
obligation with the kohlberg group 
early last week macmillan gave both maxwell and kohlberg a 
chance to make final offers for the company at the time maxwell 
was offering 8680 a share in cash while kohlberg had offered 85 
a share in cash and securities 
maxwell boosted his offer to 89 a share in cash 
but macmillan agreed to a subsequent kohlberg offer of 9005 a 
share in cash and securities and promised to sell the group four 
of macmillans businesses for 865 million should its merger not be 
concluded they are the berlitz language centers the directory 
division the direct marketing division and a division that 
publishes state legal codes 
maxwell subsequently boosted his offer to 9025 a share in 
cash subject to among other things elimination of the agreement 
to sell the four businesses 
as an alternative maxwell said he would pay 900 million for 
the four businesses that macmillan agreed to sell to kohlberg and 
to drop his tender offer 
maxwell said in court papers filed wednesday that macmillan 
chairman edward p evans had told kohlberg what maxwells final bid 
had been enabling kohlberg to top maxwells bid and demand the 
lockup option on the four businesses 
maxwell also said the sale of the four businesses had been 
structured in a way to discourage any bids for the remainder of the 
company by exposing macmillan to a 250 million tax liability on 
the sale 
a spokesman for macmillan said the communication from evans to 
the kohlberg group was appropriate spokesman david jackson said 
maxwells advisers could have asked in setting the ground rules 
for the auction that their final bid be kept secret but failed to 
do so 
macmillan has been embroiled in a takeover fight since midmay 
when a group led by the texas financier robert m bass proposed a 
buyout at 64 a share bass has since dropped out of the bidding

consolidated gold fields plc and newmont mining 
corp are raising national security issues in an attempt to get 
president reagan to block a 49 billion hostile takeover by a 
south african conglomerate 
gold fields and newmont the objects of an overture by minorco 
sa said in a filing wednesday that an acquisition by the south 
african interest would imperil us access to strategic and 
precious metals vital to national security 
gold fields which is based in london owns 493 percent of 
newmont the new yorkbased company that is the largest gold 
producer in the united states 
minorco sa last month offered 49 billion for the 71 percent 
stake it does not already own in gold fields minorco based in 
luxembourg is controlled by south africas anglo american corp 
and de beers consolidated mines ltd 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said he could not comment on 
the filing because white house officials had not yet seen it 
the defense production act as amended by this years trade 
bill authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit any merger or 
acquisition by a foreign company that threatens to impair national 
security 
gold fields and newmont asked reagan to immediately block the 
transfer of us assets pending completion of an investigation 
gold fields controls 8 percent of the worlds gold production 
it also produces rutile and zircon which are raw materials for 
metals used in military aircraft and submarines 
the proposed acquisition by minorco would be the largest 
purchase to date of us assets by south african interests half of 
gold fields assets are in the united states 
the offer for gold fields has sparked a controversy even though 
anglo american and de beers said they would relinquish control of 
minorco and minorco said it plans to sell gold fields south 
african interests 
officials at minorco in luxembourg were not available for 
comment when the filing was announced late wednesday in new york

employees in the du pont cos fibers 
business soon will have a stake in the departments earnings under 
an experimental program linking part of their pay raises to their 
departments financial performance 
the achievement sharing that takes effect jan 1 for about 
14000 workers is expected to give employees incentive to see that 
earnings continue to increase robert p mcnutt who led the team 
that developed the plan said wednesday 
there will be at least a threeyear trial for the plan and it 
then could become a model for the entire company 
mcnutt said the fibers department which makes nylon among other 
fibers has had fairly flat performance 
we need to continue to grow our earnings and its key we keep 
our people involved and were doing that by giving them a stake in 
it were making them value the business mcnutt said 
the plan is unique because it does not freeze wages or ask for 
employee givebacks as do some similar plans in the auto 
industry according to mcnutt 
chemical industry analysts say the plan is trendsetting 
although du pont is not the first company to try the concept 
harvey s stober a chemical analyst for dean witter in new 
york said the plan was long overdue and could make employees 
feel they own part of the company 
the work could improve not to say its suffered in the past 
but to tie pay certainly peaks interest stober said he also 
said such plans can lead to employees becoming more efficient and 
finding costsaving ways to do their jobs 
fibers is doing good but it should be doing better and this 
is a way to improve it said william young a managing director 
for drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
for the first six months of 1988 sales in fibers were 28 
billion compared to 26 billion for the first six months of 1987 
after tax operating income was 322 million for the first six 
months of this year and for the same period in 1987 
under the plan du pont will begin placing an increasing portion 
of each workers annual pay raise at risk until 6 percent of 
each employees salary is at risk that could take from three to 
five years 
during the phasein period each employee will always receive at 
least 1 percent of any raise regardless of the fibers business 
performance 
annual pay will be based on a target rate equalling what du pont 
would pay employees not covered by the experimental plan and 
raises and promotions would be based on the target rate the 
company will adjust actual pay each year based on the fibers 
business financial results 
if the department achieves 150 percent of its profit goal 
employees would get back the 6 percent of their pay thats at risk 
plus a bonus of up to 12 percent of their salary depending on the 
excess earnings mcnutt said 
if the department achieves 80 percent of its profit goal the 
payout would be 3 percent of the money at risk if the department 
earns less than 80 percent of its profit goal there would be no 
payout meaning the employees would not get the 6 percent of their 
raises that had been placed at risk 
the department has about 20000 employees worldwide most of 
whom will fall under the plan jan 1 the company must negotiate 
with about 6000 union workers at plants in delaware tennessee and 
virginia before those workers will partipate 
donald m hitchens president of the seaford nylon employees 
council a union representing about 1670 employees said the union 
probably would vote on the plan by the end of the month 
but he said he did not know what impact the unions current wage 
dispute with the company would have on acceptance of the plan 
since march the union twice has rejected the companys offer of a 
19 percent raise and a 400 lump sum payment

nissan motor corp in usa is pinning 
hopes for a turnaround in a threeyear sales slump on new vehicles 
to debut in each of the 1989 and 1990 model years 
nissan introduced its 1989 model line on wednesday with general 
manager robert thomas saying the japanese automaker is looking 
toward a restyled maxima sedan and new 240sx to begin pulling the 
company out of the sales doldrums 
in the spring nissan plans to introduce a new version of the 
300zx and a small minivan called the axxess he said 
our immediate success is riding on these new models thomas 
said 
nissans sales in the united states fell to 660652 cars and 
light trucks in the justended 1988 model year from 781280 
vehicles in the 1986 model year a 154 percent decline 
sales have not reached expectations for us or for others in 
the industry thomas said we can look to a lot of reasons for 
a flat performance like currency intensifying competition or even 
vacillating buyer moods 
im optimistic about the future he said right now our 
market share hovers around 4 percent i think we can build that 
share to more than 5 percent by the early 1990s largely on the 
strength of the four new models well be bringing out in the next 
year 
but the sales turnaround wont take place immediately if 
projections thomas cited wednesday are accurate he said he expects 
nissan to sell about 660000 vehicles in the 1989 model year which 
would continue the erosion of sales 
thomas said the low projections for 1989 stemmed from among 
other things limited availability of 240sx models the arrival 
later this month of maximas to dealer showrooms and the yendollar 
exchange rate 
we also recognize weve got to build up our image he said 
thomas also said wednesday 
nissans plant in smyrna tenn has the capacity for another 
assembly line but that no decision has been made about whether to 
expand the plant or if so what vehicle would be produced there 
the joint venture between nissan and ford motor co in avon 
lake ohio would produce a larger minivan than the axxess the 
nissanford project is to begin production in 1991 for the 1992 
model year 
the axxess will have dual rear sliding doors instead of the 
conventional right side sliding door on other minivans the 
advantage of the axxess is our product will have power 
performance and handling thomas said

progovernment newspapers thursday denounced 
british prime minister margaret thatchers government for its 
shortsighted decision to slash kuwaits holdings in the 
british petroleum co and warned it will damage relations 
the newspapers urged kuwaits government to take retaliatory 
measures against britains request tuesday that the kuwait 
investment office reduce its holding in bp from 2168 percent to 
99 percent over the next year 
the kuwait investment office the oilrich gulf states 
londonbased investment arm has bought up 1316 billion bp shares 
since the british government sold off its onethird stake in the 
oil giant last year 
kuwait stands to lose nearly 680 million at current market 
prices if it cuts its bp holdings to the level the british are 
seeking 
the radical alrai alaam daily newspaper said in an editorial 
the british decision will inevitably endanger political as well 
as trade relations between the two countries 
despite attempts by the british government to justify its 
uncordial and unjust decision the british step will endanger 
britishkuwaiti relations 
the englishlanguage kuwait times called the british decision 
a shortsighted step 
the newspaper said it scarcely behoves a country like britain 
and a government like mrs thatchers to make such titanic 
intervention as the demand made of kuwait 
the plain truth is that kuwaits purchase of the bp shares 
was in effect a rescue operation by a sincere friend of britain 
the 12 billion bp share sale was a flop with investors because 
it coincided with the financial market crash last october kuwait 
subsequently stepped in as a buyer 
kuwait bought 10 percent of bp shares last november and 
gradually increased that to 2168 percent

speculation over burgeoning world oil supplies 
and unsubstantiated rumors about further rifts within opec have 
helped push oil futures below the 13abarrel level 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate plunged 47 cents to settle at 1260 a 
barrel wednesday in heavy hectic trading still the benchmark 
us crude recovered from its intraday low of 1228 barrel 
in early trading today it was up another 22 cents at 1282 a 
barrel 
crude futures prices have not been this low since august 1986 a 
month ago the nearterm wti contract had settled at 1479 
among refined products traded on the exchange the november 
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 167 cents to settle 
at 3944 cents a gallon while home heating oil slipped 041 cent 
to 3776 cents a gallon 
much of the days selling was technical in nature analysts said 
oil prices fell sharply on early rumors that nigeria had decided 
to leave the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries and that opec general secretary subroto known as a 
crafter of compromises would step down 
prices recovered somewhat when the rumors were denied 
nauman barakat vice president of energy investment at 
prudentialbache securities inc said this market has become so 
rumorsensitive that even if a story doesnt sound credible there 
is a violent reaction 
barakat said at least some of the rumors were being instigated 
by floor traders seeking to benefit their own positions he also 
said saudi arabia was giving the market a dose of its own 
intensive shock therapy 
saudi arabia the worlds largest exporter has voiced threats 
that it will continue overproducing unless other opec members abide 
by their production quotas 
were in a price war said peter beutel an assistant 
director at elders futures inc unless the saudis change their 
policy the only way oil prices will rise is through technical 
factors 
theres no hope on the fundamental front he said 
even before trading began the market was poised for a selloff 
with the latest statistics from the american petroleum institute 
the report which was released after the close of trading tuesday 
showed a higherthanexpected increase in crude oil stocks 
the report also showed a sharp increase in refinery runs it 
just scares people to see the refineries looking like they are 
going to increase the supply of refined products beutel said

it will be the first privatization since the selloff of the 
governments onethird stake in british petroleum co plc which 
coincided with the stock market crash last fall analysts said they 
expect the sale to raise 3 billion that 12 billion bp share sale 
was a flop with investors and left underwriters holding large 
chunks of the stock 
kuwait subsequently stepped in as a buyer accumulating a 22 
percent stake in the oil giant which the government this week 
ordered more than halved saying such a large holding would 
conflict with the public interest

steel for five years after the sale to prevent any single holding 
exceeding 15 percent

coniston partners offered today to acquire tw 
services inc in a deal that values the food services concern at 
136 billion 
the proposal which would pay 28 for each of the 3927 million 
tw shares coniston does not already own had been expected the 
aggressive new york investment firm acknowledged two weeks ago that 
it had amassed a 19 percent stake in tw and might seek to acquire 
the company 
in a letter delivered to the tw board today coniston said that 
while it considered the offering price to be full and fair it 
was willing to consider offering more if tw can demonstrate 
sufficient business prospects to justify doing so 
the coniston principals have said that they consider tw which 
operates the dennys and hardees fastfood chains to be a prime 
candidate for a leveraged buyout in such a buyout the purchaser 
relies on borrowed money secured by a target companys assets to 
finance an acquisition the loans are repaid out of cash flow and 
divestitures 
after an initial delay in trading tw opened at 2650 a share 
up 162 on the new york stock exchange 
coniston paid an average 19 a share for the 928 million tw 
shares it purchased over a period of days in september at the 
current offering price the acquisition would cost the firm an 
additional 113 billion 
coniston principal paul tierney jr said in a telephone 
interview that he and his partners met with tw chairman frank 
salizzoni and other executives recently 
while that meeting was quite cordial and reasonable tierney 
said the conclusion of the tw board was that it did not wish to 
sell the company at that time to coniston 
tierney said he hoped that the much more specific terms such 
as price and financing spelled out in todays letter would give 
the tw board reason to reconsider 
if the board again rejected the overture tierney said the 
partnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly to 
shareholders coniston requested a response by wednesday 
formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of trans 
world corp tw services reported profits of 472 million on 
revenue of 25 billion last year the companys 850 million 
acquisition of the dennys chain in late 1987 is expected to boost 
revenues to the 35 billion mark this year 
dennys operates about 1250 restaurants nationwide tw also 
owns the chicagobased canteen corp which contracts food vending 
and recreational services throughout the nation at places like 
stadiums and national parks 
the company also owns spartan food systems inc of spartanburg 
sc the unit operates more than 400 hardees restaurants and 200 
quincy family steak houses mostly in the southeastern part of the 
country 
coniston partners with a warchest estimated at about 700 
million typically takes large positions in companies and uses that 
clout to force management to sell the company or make changes that 
boost the stock price

european commission president jacques 
delors of france met thursday with spanish prime minister felipe 
gonzalez to discuss spains upcoming presidency of the european 
economic community spanish officials said 
gonzalez met for an hour with delors head of the eecs 
executive branch and spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez 
ordonez at the prime ministers official moncloa palace residence 
the officials said 
gonzalez then hosted a luncheon for delors whose 24hour visit 
was the first of a scheduled tour of the capitals of portugal 
greece and italy 
earlier thursday delors spoke with king juan carlos for an hour 
on european issues said a palace spokesman not identified in 
keeping with custom 
spain is expected to exercise a strong presidency when it takes 
over the sixmonth rotating office next jan 1 for the first time 
since joining the 12member trade bloc in 1986 european commission 
member abel matutes of spain told spanish national radio thursday 
the commission and the community in general expect a lot from 
the spanish presidency matutes said 
spain has clear ideas and for that reason there is a 
possibility of agreement or at least noticeable progress on 
important issues like social space and monetary unity matutes 
said 
gonzalez led the fight to double economic development funds by 
1992 for the eecs poorer regions mainly in spain greece 
portugal italy and ireland 
the social space concept criticized by british prime 
minister margaret thatcher as bureaucratic jargon aims to 
increase development funds for poor areas and guarantee basic 
workers rights and salary levels as the borderless economic market 
imposes much expected pressure on labor 
but government sources who asked not to be named said 
gonzalez leader of the ruling socialist party and a former labor 
lawyer intends to place the concept high on his list of priorities 
during the spanish presidency 
gonzalez also has said his government is studying the 
possibility of making the peseta the spanish currency a member of 
the european monetary system before late next year 
the ems sets limits on fluctuations of the value of several 
european currencies to maintain monetary stability

senate republican leader bob dole said today 
the next president and congress must find a solution to the 
problems plaguing the savings and loan industry or they could 
affect the entire us economy 
doles comments on the senate floor came a day after the 
governments top thrift industry regulator raised the estimated 
price tag for cleaning up the industry from 31 billion to 45 
billion or more 
dole of kansas told his fellow senators that the issue 
transcends politics 
the time has come to stop the political fingerpointing he 
said there is plenty of blame to go around congress the carter 
administration the reagan administration a number of state 
legislatures federal regulators and industry management must all 
share some of the responsibility for the thrift industrys 
problems dole said 
we should not let politics affect our better judgment the 
problems facing the thrift industry are serious if unaddressed 
they could affect the entire us economy he said 
on wednesday m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan 
bank board which regulates federally chartered sampls argued for 
congress to raise the ceiling on how much it can borrow to bail out 
ailing thrifts 
just three months ago wall had raised his estimate from 22 
billion to 31 billion now he says the bailout cost is in the 
range of 45 billion to 50 billion 
some private analysts put the cost as high as 100 billion 
but dole said today that more money by itself is not the 
answer 
its going to take time to come up with a responsible 
workable solution and unfortunately the 100th congress doesnt 
have any left the republican leader said urging president 
reagans succesor and the congress sworn in next january to make 
finding a solution a top priority 
the house banking committee voted 2922 on wednesday to expand 
the boards borrowing limit from 108 billion in bonds to 158 
billion the move is opposed by the industry which pays an 
assessment to retire the 30year bonds 
the panels chairman rep fernand j st germain said the 
senate would be hard put to oppose an expansion of the bank 
boards borrowing limit since last summe when congress authorized 
108 billion in borrowing over three years the senate pushed for 
a higher limit of 15 billion 
the bank board already has issued 375 billion in bonds the 
banking committee bill would permit the bank board to float the 
remaining amount as soon as needed rather than spreading it over 
the next two years 
so far this year the bank board has committed 20 billion to 
close or merge 122 troubled thrifts 
wall said his agencys resources could cover the newly estimated 
cost but only by placing an exceedingly heavy burden on the 
industry thrift institutions currently pay more than twice as much 
as their competitors commercial banks for deposit insurance and 
wall said that differential would have to continue over 30 years if 
his agency did not get help 
the head of the industrys largest trade group the us league 
of savings institutions said extending the differential for 30 
years would be an intolerable burden 
the special assessment has made the difference between profit 
and loss for 69 solvent savings institutions so far this year in 
other words in the process of removing 122 insolvents 
regulators have been driving another 69 which are now healthy 
closer to becoming problem cases league chairman theo h pitt 
jr said 
wall said taxpayers would not necessarily have to pay the bill 
for boosting the bank boards resources he listed alternatives 
without endorsing any that included requiring institutions to 
place 1 percent of their deposits into the sampl insurance fund 
borrowing from the insurance fund for commercial banks or from the 
federal reserve and charging borrowers a fee for mortgages 
provided by sampls

share prices on the london stock exchange ended 
higher near the days best levels thursday as trading activity 
continued at a relatively brisk pace for the second consecutive day 
dealers said the market repeated the pattern of wednesdays 
performance when modest buying by institutions was more than 
matched by aggressive shortcovering by market makers 
shortcovering is the buying of shares to fulfill agreements to

union pacific corp said thursday it 
will close the regional offices of its energy and mining subsidiary 
in denver and houston and consolidate those operations in fort 
worth by the end of the year 
the consolidation and reduced overhead from the recently 
announced sales of the companys wilmington calif refinery and 
its calnev pipe line co should help the union pacific resources 
co save at least 45 million a year said william l adams 
chairman and chief executive officer 
the consolidation at union pacifics corporate headquarters will 
add 400 jobs to the 550 that already exist in fort worth but the 
reorganization will eliminate about 400 jobs throughout the 
company he said 
it is clear that the expense of maintaining our regional 
offices cannot be justified in todays volatile and depressed oil 
pricing environment adams said thus we are streamlining to 
maintain our position as a lowcost finder and producer of oil and 
gas 
were going to do everything we can to cushion the blow for 
those affected including ample severance pay and outplacement 
services adams said while we will close offices in denver and 
houston we will still be active participants in the energy 
business in both areas 
union pacific resources will maintain production offices in rock 
springs wyo and wilmington and the firm will continue to operate 
its minerals group from denver adams said operations of the 
firms canadian subsidiary union pacific resources inc of 
calgary will be unchanged 
since the 1986 oil price collapse that sent prices from 24 to 
10 a barrel union pacific has been affected by the nationwide 
trend in which the domestic oil and gas industry lost some 400000 
jobs adams said 
in response to the 1986 collapse we have instituted various 
cost containment measures that including this reorganization will 
result in annual savings in excess of 267 million before tax 
adams said 
union pacific resources now has 375 people in its denver office 
and 325 in houston 
union pacific also announced three executive appointments as 
part of the consolidation on jan 1 robert s jackson now vice 
presidentfinance becomes executive vice president and chief 
financial officer dale w bossert vice president and regional 
managerdenver becomes vice president of production and george 
lindahl iii regional exploration managerhouston becomes vice

union pacific resources had net income of 183 million on sales 
of 14 billion last year

the british governments demand that kuwait cut in 
half its stake in british petroleum co plc has drawn fire from 
critics who fear it might discourage foreign investment in the 
already depressed london stock market 
the government says it acted to defend the free market against a 
cartel the organization of petroleum exporting countries to which 
kuwait belongs 
british petroleum is britains largest company and the persian 
gulf nation of kuwait is its biggest shareholder 
representatives of big british brokerage firms charged that the 
action departs from prime minister margaret thatchers commitment 
to letting the market alone 
the governments whole freemarket policy is showing itself to 
be either confused or shallow said humphrey harrison director 
of energy research at the london investment firm kitcat and aitken 
perhaps a new wave of protectionism is coming in government 
intervention in what had been a free and open market he said 
uncertainty never helps investment said leo doyle an 
economist at the london investment firm kleinwort grieveson ltd 
you might well see equity prices fall quite substantially i 
think its fair to say its another nail in the coffin 
the kuwait investment office the gulf states londonbased 
investment arm was ordered on tuesday to reduce its 5 billion 
stake in british petroleum from 22 percent to 99 percent over the 
next year 
mrs thatchers conservative government said kuwaits holding 
likely would conflict with the public interest analysts said 
kuwait stood to lose nearly 400 million pounds 676 million in 
what would be one of the worlds biggest divestitures 
the kuwait government said only that it was considering its 
options but progovernment kuwaiti newspapers urged retaliation 
the order could chill relations between the two countries and 
some analysts speculated that kuwait would review all its british 
investments 
onefifth of kuwaits estimated 80 billion in overseas 
holidings are in britain including a recently disclosed 51 stake 
in midland bank plc one of britans largest commercial banks 
critics in britain called the decision inconsistent 
hypocritical punitive and ungrateful toward kuwait a longtime 
british ally 
the daily telegraph quoted one unidentified analyst as saying it 
smacked of a you cant trust the arabs attitude 
but trade secretary lord young insisted the decision reaffirmed 
freemarket beliefs saying kuwait is a member of opec one of 
the great cartels of the world we will not be part of that 
cartel 
the monopolies and mergers commission on whose recommendation 
the government acted expressed concerns that kuwait might try to 
boost its own oil earnings by forcing british petroleum to pump 
less north sea oil or cut exploration and development 
the conservative financial times supported the decision saying 
the rules were properly applied the argument was fair and the 
outcome correct 
mrs thatcher a strong advocate of freemarket policies has 
presided over a capitalist revolution in britain since taking 
office in 1979 selling off stateowned industries and encouraging 
public shareownership 
in addition when the government reviews large acquisitions of 
british shares it is usually with the aim of safeguarding 
competition 
at the same time britain has a history of retaining golden 
shares which guarantee ultimate control of companies it views as 
strategically vital 
it also has limited foreign holdings to a total of 15 percent in 
other privatizations 
but there is a fundamental difference in the british 
petroleum case harrison said in previous cases those things 
were notified in advance with the foreign investor knowing in 
advance what the terms and conditions were 
it is common on britains takeover scene for british targets of 
foreign bidders to wage emotional campaigns to keep themselves 
british the opposition labor party also is always quick to raise 
national sentiments when attacking the governments freemarket 
policies 
what prompted outcry over the governments british petroleum 
decision was the fact that kuwait had made unsolicited legally 
binding pledges not to increase its stake or to use it to further 
any other commercial or political interest of kuwait 
also kuwaits purchase of the 1316 billion shares had bailed 
the government out of an embarrassing situation last fall 
kuwaits intervention relieved the government from having to 
fulfill its potentially costly promise to buy back unsold british 
petroleum shares after its sale of its onethird stake in the oil 
giant coincided with the stock market crash and flopped leaving 
underwriters holding large amounts of stock 
harrison said the government has twice intervened against the 
free market in british petroleums case first by guaranteeing to 
buy back unsold shares and now by its action against kuwait 
why privatize british petroleum if its of such strategic 
significance he asked noting that the government didnt retain 
a golden share or previously limit foreign holdings in british 
petroleum 
many analysts also were shocked by the size of the reduction 
ordered saying they had expected a cut to 15 percent and by the 
deadline set for disposing of the shares 
unless the government extends the time period for kuwait to sell 
the 700 million british petroleum shares the effect on the 
postcrash market will be quite serious harrison said 
there is going to be a perception that maybe weve reached the 
zenith of the free market certainly a perception by foreign 
investors that competition policy is by no means welldefined he 
said 
it will knock london as a financial center harrison charged

trans world airlines inc chairman carl icahn 
reportedly has held discussions with texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo on the sale of ailing eastern airlines to twa 
the talks center on a friendly transaction that would be 
acceptable to icahn lorenzo and easterns unions according to 
sources close to the situation who requested anonymity miamibased 
eastern is a major subsidiary of texas air 
the discussions with icahn included representatives of easterns 
unions the sources told the associated press today 
new york developer donald trump meanwhile said wednesday that 
he was close to agreement with lorenzo on the sale of easterns 
threecity air shuttle service to trump and that a contract could 
be signed by next week trump reportedly would pay more than 300 
million cash for the shuttle 
eastern declined comment on the developments concerning both 
icahn and trump 
quite frankly were not commenting on either report its our 
policy not to comment on rumors said eastern spokesman robin 
matell in miami 
twa had no comment on the situation said mark buckstein twas 
senior vice president and general counsel who was acting as a 
spokesman for the airline trump and his representatives were 
unavailable for comment today 
on wednesday unions at eastern reacted angrily to a report that 
texas air was discussing the possible sale of its east coast 
shuttle to trump 
the pilots union warned it would seek a court order to block any 
such deal and the head of the machinists union suggested his union 
would do the same the unions successfully blocked an attempt 
earlier this year by texas air to transfer the shuttle operation 
from eastern to a new subsidiary 
the unions appear to favor a sale of all of eastern as a going 
concern to a friendly acquirer while they are opposed to the sale 
or transfer of its assets such as the shuttle 
icahn was approached a few weeks ago by representatives of the 
machinists union at eastern about the possible sale of the carrier 
dow jones professional investor report said today 
eastern lost 898 million in the second quarter of the year 
and recently laid off around 3000 employees

despite drexel burnham lambert incs battle 
over charges of securities fraud clients arent abandoning the 
wall street powerhouse that pioneered the 100 billion highyield 
junk bond market 
on the contrary theyre extolling the virtues of drexel and its 
employees particularly the financier who largely created that 
market michael milken some clients go so far as to accuse 
government prosecutors of witchhunt tactics 
the unabashed defense of drexel even from clients the 
government claims were cheated suggests the 2yearold crackdown 
on wall street corruption heralded for bringing speculator ivan 
boesky to justice may now be creating a backlash 
certainly the lines of distinction that separated the bad guys 
from the good are becoming blurred drexel and milken once seen as 
arrogant aggressive manipulators behind junkbond financed 
takeover deals are taking on underdog roles in the wake of the 
charges leveled sept 7 by the securities and exchange commission 
moreover the zealous loyalty drexel is inspiring suggests most 
clients are little concerned with whether the firm or milken may 
have technically violated securities laws what counts more is the 
firms extraordinary ability to finance projects from day care 
centers to toxic waste cleanups to employee buyouts of big 
companies 
if results are the principal test of customer satisfaction on 
wall street drexel passes with flying colors 
i have nothing but accolades for those guys said stuart 
subotnick metromedia inc executive vice president who recruited 
drexel four years ago to help the company refinance by issuing 13 
billion in junk bonds which at the time was the biggest such 
transaction in history 
i must say to you that in 1984 they were head and shoulders 
above other firms with respect to their ability pricing and in 
the end on execution subotnick said everything drexel 
promised to do and then some they did 
subotnick said he was so impressed with drexel he recently 
recommended the firm to another large company that wants to 
refinance 
james mccloskey vice president for finance at concurrent 
computer corp a new jersey concern that has merged with 
massachusetts computer corp in a drexelfinanced deal also 
expressed admiration 
the financing was raised drexel did perform he said 
thats the ultimate proof of the pudding 
some clients are so passionate about their defense of the firm 
and milken that they see the legal struggle as the tip of a more 
profound fight which pits a new breed of entrepreneur against an 
established economic order 
in their view milkens visionary talents and financing power 
have aroused the wrath of rivals and washington policymakers who 
see highyield bonds as a risky form of debt and are intent on 
destroying the 42yearold financier 
he hasnt yet actually been accused of culpability for the 
mexican earthquake or for hurricane gilbert or even for the 
greenhouse effect that as you know threatens terrestrial life as 
we know it said ingersoll publications co chairman ralph 
ingersoll a drexel client and milken friend 
otherwise there does not seem to be a lot that a frustrated 
bureaucracy bent on a salemstyle witch hunt hasnt attempted to 
blame on this man 
milken who appeared at a recent publishing conference sponsored 
by ingersoll declined to talk about the allegations against him or 
other aspects of the government investigation but milken suggested 
hes been treated harshly and his work is widely misunderstood 
i think we probably havent done a good job explaining he 
said but you know sometimes somethings a twoway street you 
have to care to want to understand too 
the highyield bonds milken is credited with developing are debt 
securities that pay high interest often issued by companies that 
cannot get investmentgrade status from major creditrating 
agencies 
pilloried by critics as a weapon for funding hostile takeovers 
the highyield bond market has emerged as an important source of 
alternative longterm financing for hundreds of small and 
mediumsized companies 
for its part drexel has attempted to shed the image as a prime 
purveyor of highyield bonds for hostile takeovers and now 
promotes the idea that such securities serve more useful and 
productive purposes 
a blitz of drexel advertisements suggest its highyield bonds 
finance only the most morally upright enterprises such as 
kindercare inc a network of daycare and preschool learning 
centers hovnanian enterprises inc a housing developer and 
unimar international inc a shipbuilder purchased by employees 
the cover of drexels highyield bond unit 1988 annual report is 
an artists rendition of typical smalltown usa replete with a 
hospital shopping mall and school built on a rolledout carpet of 
highyield bonds 
for almost two years drexel and milken have been under intense 
scrutiny by the sec and manhattan us attorneys office the 
result of a deal struck with boesky a convicted insider trader to 
turn states evidence and identify others in his illegal acts 
last month the sec finally accused drexel milken and three 
other employees of secretly scheming with boesky to violate a range 
of securities laws that centered on some of the biggest takeover 
deals of the decade 
but the charges seemed based mostly on boeskys claims and fell 
far short of speculation that dozens of drexel employees would be 
implicated 
the us attorneys office has yet to bring any charges and 
there is talk that the grand jury investigation it is directing has 
been delayed there also have been other indications that 
investigators have found it difficult to obtain conclusive evidence 
to support boeskys revelations 
even before the sec filed its charges investigators had come 
under attack from drexel and its supporters for leaking sensitive 
details of the probes to pressure the brokerage into settlement 
talks officials denied those allegations and continue to 
characterize their pursuit of wall street wrongdoers as an 
important part of the campaign against whitecollar crime 
perhaps the most serious of the secs charges against drexel are 
that it cheated two important clients maxxam group inc and wickes 
cos in the midst of prominent takeover deals a few years ago 
but if maxxam and wickes believe they were victimized they 
havent said so or moved to sue drexel on their own 
instead wickes issued a statement supporting drexel which is 
helping wickes management finance an acquisition of the company 
wickes said the sec action would have no impact on that transaction 
other drexel clients in the midst of deals also have come to its 
defense 
ernest bates president chairman and chief executive of 
american shared hospital services in san francisco said he 
expected no adverse impact on his companys proposed public 
offering of stocks and debt securities 
we continue to have the highest confidence in drexel he 
said we trust the current litigation will be resolved promptly 
and that these key financing mechanisms will continue to be widely 
available in the marketplace

coniston partners proposed thursday to acquire 
foods giant tw services inc for 113 billion in a friendly deal 
but held out the possibility of launching a hostile tender offer if 
the bid is rebuffed 
the proposal which would pay 28 in cash for each of the 3927 
million tw shares coniston does not already own had been expected 
the aggressive new york investment firm acknowledged two weeks ago 
that it had amassed a 19 percent stake in tw and might seek to 
acquire the company whose operations include the dennys 
restaurant chain 
tw spokesman james ryan said the board had received a letter 
from coniston and was reviewing the offer but shortly after 
conistons stake was disclosed last month the tw board indicated 
intended to remain independent 
on the new york stock exchange tw stock jumped 175 a share to 
2662 in afternoon trading 
in the letter coniston said that while it considered the 
offering price to be full and fair it was willing to 
consider offering more if tw can demonstrate sufficient business 
prospects to justify doing so 
wall street analysts agreed the price was reasonable but some 
have estimated that tws breakup value might be as high as 34 a 
share 
the coniston principals have said that they consider tw to be a 
prime candidate for a leveraged buyout in such a buyout the 
purchaser relies on borrowed money secured by a target companys 
assets to finance an acquisition the loans are repaid out of cash 
flow and occasionally the sale of assets 
in this case however coniston hinted it would not completely 
dismember tw which also operates food services companies and a 
small chain of nursing homes 
we would like to work with operating management to build and 
enhance the companys core food service and restaurant business 
coniston said in its letter 
the partnership which made the bid through swt associates 
limited partnership is going to be a major force to reckon 
with said lloyd rixe an analyst with the investment firm da 
davidson amp co in great falls mont 
its anybodys guess if someone else will surface he said 
coniston paid an average 19 a share for the 928 million tw 
shares it purchased over a period of days in september roughly 72 
million of those shares had belonged to billionaire takeover 
strategist ronald o perelman chairman of revlon inc 
after meeting with coniston principals late last month tws 
chief executive officer frank salizzoni said in view of the 
bright operating prospects for the company we believe that the 
shareholders will be served best by the companys remaining 
independent 
coniston principal paul tierney jr said in a telephone 
interview that he hoped that the much more specific terms such as 
price and financing spelled out in thursdays letter would give 
the tw board reason to reconsider 
if the board again rejected the overture tierney said the 
partnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly to 
shareholders coniston requested a response by wednesday 
formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of trans 
world corp tw services reported profits of 472 million on 
revenue of 25 billion last year the companys 850 million 
acquisition of the dennys chain in late 1987 is expected to boost 
revenues to the 35 billion mark this year 
tw attributed its strong secondquarter performance to dennys 
better than expected showing since the acquisition tw has trimmed 
staff and embarked on a program to remodel the 1220restaurant 
chain over the next five years the company plans to expand the 
chain by 500 restaurants 
theyve been making claims that dennys has surpassed wendys 
as the no 3 restaurant chain in the nation said jay freedman 
an analyst at kidder peabody amp co 
tw also owns the chicagobased canteen corp which contracts 
food vending and recreational services throughout the nation at 
places like stadiums and national parks ryan said canteen has more 
than 1700 accounts and about 15 billion in annual sales 
the company also owns spartan food systems inc of spartanburg 
sc the unit operates more than 400 hardees restaurants and 200 
quincy family steak houses mostly in the southeastern part of the 
country 
coniston partners with a warchest estimated at about 700 
million typically takes large positions in companies and uses that 
clout to force management to sell the company or make changes that 
boost the stock price 
coniston recently emerged from a bitter proxy battle with 
gillette co that saw the partners narrowly lose their bid for four 
seats on the razorblade makers board of directors ultimately the 
two sides reached a settlement that included a stock buyback and a 
standstill agreement

a federal appeals court on thursday rejected an 
unusual request by drexel burnham lambert inc to disqualify the 
judge presiding over the governments fraud case against the wall 
street firm 
the us 2nd circuit court of appeals in manhattan said in a 
written ruling that the move by attorneys for drexel and other 
defendants in the case to remove us district judge milton pollack 
was premature 
pollack previously scheduled his own hearing for next tuesday to 
hear arguments on the defense effort to remove him 
the defense is seeking pollacks removal on grounds his wife has 
an interest in a corporate transaction financed by drexel 
defense attorneys had said in an extraordinary petition to the 
appeals court last week that pollacks involvement created an 
appearance of impropriety they apparently feared that if 
pollack issued a favorable ruling to their clients a higher court 
might overturn it on appeal 
the securities and exchange commission which had sought pollack 
for the case when it sued drexel sept 7 in us district court 
had challenged the defense effort to remove him in a filing with 
the appeals court wednesday the sec said the connection between 
pollacks wife and drexel was extremely remote and was not grounds 
for prejudice 
drexel its highyield bond financier michael milken and others 
have been accused by the sec of violating a range of securities 
laws in alleged schemes with ivan f boesky the nowimprisoned 
inside trader who has been cooperating in the governments 
investigation of wall street corruption 
the defendants have denied the accusations

us labor secretary ann mclaughlin 
and one of her predecessors offered sharply contrasting opinions 
thursday on whether the united states has lost its competitive edge 
in world trade 
im not sure were behind mrs mclaughlin said at the third 
annual rhode island conference on labormanagement relations 
right now exports are up and the trade deficit is falling 
but ray marshall labor secretary during the carter 
administration said that while some economic measures of 
competitiveness may not indicate a decline the united states has 
fallen behind in productivity and real income levels 
marshall in a speech to more than 300 business and academic 
officials said the next president will have to define a clear set 
of goals before the country will again become competitive with 
other countries 
we have a passive trade policy they have an active trade 
policy he said the country with an active trade policy will 
win because they know where they want to get and how theyre going 
to get there 
mrs mclaughlin in an interview and an upbeat speech to the 
group disagreed and said the labor departments present programs 
will get the job done 
the united states unlike japan and some other western 
countries does not have a centralized economy so the government 
cannot impose the goals that marshall suggested mrs mclaughlin 
said 
the speakers at the conference agreed that more attention should 
be paid to improving management systems and the education and 
services provided to workers 
mrs mclaughlin said issues such as parental leave should be 
negotiated between unions and management rather than imposed by 
the federal government 
im saddened that they seem to want to push for federal 
legislation she said if theres federal legislation then 
theres less incentive to negotiate 
robert b mckersie an industrial relations professor at the 
massachusetts institute of technology said such issues give unions 
a wedge to organize industries where workers have so far not been 
interested 
while unions have seen little recent organizing success it 
appears that employees do not appear to be satisfied with the 
status quo mckersie said the workforce appears to have 
unsatisfied demands in areas such as pay equity career 
development day care and maternity leave 
marshall now a professor at the university of texas said 
productivity per worker in and of itself is not the reason the 
country has declined relative to korea japan and other economic 
powers 
were four times as productive as the koreans the problem is 
the wage differential is six to one he said so even if were 
more productive they can undercut us with lower wages 
marshall added that the united states will never be able to cut 
wages to the point where they are competitive with the koreans and 
should not try to do so 
mrs mclaughlin said she views education as the key to keeping 
the workforce competitive 
simply put we have to get serious together many of you in 
this room about public education she said the fact is that 
the current pool of applicants for entrylevel jobs lacks basic 
skills such as reading writing problemsolving and 
communication

the fraud indictment of a florida citrus 
company is the first growing out of a 22month nationwide 
investigation of illegal citrus practices involving hundreds of 
millions of dollars federal officials said thursday 
it was the first indictment but the investigation is not 
limited to florida said brad knutter supervisor of the the 
tampa us customs fraud group which is coordinating the probe 
the lengthy probe dubbed operation orange squeeze is an 
unprecedented investigation by the us customs service of the 
citrus industry in florida and other citrusproducing states 
officals said 
a highland city citrus processor its ohio parent company and 
two of its former presidents were indicted tuesday accused of 
conspiring to bilk the federal government in a customs rebate scam 
allsun pure juice corp ohio pure foods inc of akron ohio 
and two former allsun executives robert w hurley 57 of lakeland 
and herman b cohen 67 of ormond beach were charged with 
mislabeling export products between 1983 and 1986 in order to 
collect 776458 in us customs rebates 
authorities charge the defendants attempted to cheat the 
government by labeling almost 2 million gallons of citrus pulpwash 
as frozen concentrated orange juice in 36 export shipments 
pulpwash is the residual citrus product left after the primary 
juice claim those rebates for 
exporting pulpwash an inferior citrus byproduct authorities say 
trying to pass the pulpwash off as concentrated orange juice was a 
fraud the indictment says 
the defendants have so far declined to comment on charges listed 
in the indictment 
custom laws allow companies 99 percent refund of import duties 
if products made from imported merchandise are later exported the 
rebate also is allowed if the export is produced from a domestic 
substitute of the same kind and quality as the dutypaid import 
officials say more charges are expected against other exporters 
pulpwash may be one of the more fraudulent activities but 
were not limiting the investigation to that knutter said 
in order to track exports he said investigators have to trace 
shipping records and trucking reports involving a number of 
companies 
this is just the start said customs agent steve bowman 
well be busy for a while 
bowman said investigators discovered a number of citrus 
concentrate exporters involved in the practice of mislabeling 
pulpwash as concentrate to get the rebates 
when asked if future cases involved as much as hundreds of 
millions of dollars bowman said overall that would be a 
conservative estimate 
customs officials said the agencys findings could hurt the 
credibility of floridas citrus industry 
operation orange squeeze has exposed a situation that could 
have a devastating effect on the florida citrus industry said 
customs agent bonni tischler in tampa following natural 
disasters like the freezes of recent years and the citrus canker 
infestations the last thing the florida orange growers and 
processors need is a company defrauding the government in order to 
make a few extra dollars 
only about 3 percent of the florida industry involves citrus 
concentrate exporting according to dr robert behr economic 
research director for the citrus department 
processors legitimately sell pulpwash to beverage companies who 
use it to produce diluted citrus drinks 
revenue in the industry totaled more than 3 billion last 
season he said of that amount about 100 million comes from 
concentrate exports according to behr

in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is

shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30307 billion a 38 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 38436 billion up 57 percent while m1 
rose 56 percent to an average of 7826 billion 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent

percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since

the kroger co said thursday it is laying off 
about 300 employees at its cincinnati headquarters as part of a 
corporate restructuring it is undertaking while fighting two 
takeover offers 
most of those being laid off have been notified and will have 
their last days on the job friday company spokesman paul bernish 
said 
the layoffs basically cover everything from vice president to 
the secretary level bernish said about 500 employees will 
remain at krogers headquarters 
kroger the nations largest supermarket operator said the 
layoffs and elimination of associated costs will save the company 
at least 13 million a year 
there is nothing more difficult than terminating the jobs of 
so many dedicated and loyal employees however major expense 
reductions are critical to the successful implementation of our 
restructuring program kroger chairman lyle everingham said 
company officials said all of the affected employees are being 
given separation packages that provide a maximum of six to nine 
months salary and continuing healthandlife insurance coverage 
for up to one year the packages also include pay for unused 1988 
or 1989 vacation time companypaid job placement assistance or up 
to 2500 reimbursement for tuition expenses 
everingham and kroger president joseph pichler had said last 
week that the layoffs along with sales of some company stores 
real estate and foodprocessing plants would all be part of the 
restructuring 
this week the marylandbased haft family which has a 
reputation as a corporate raider offered kroger help in fighting 
off a takeover bid in a contest the hafts started 
the hafts who control dart group inc the company which last 
month began the bidding competition for kroger issued a statement 
wednesday that some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance 
to help kroger fend off a threat from kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co a new york corporate takeover specialist 
we would be interested in working with kroger management to 
enhance the restructuring program by providing additional equity 
dart executive robert haft said in his oneline statement 
referring to krogers proposed 46 billion corporate 
restructuring plan 
kohlbergs latest buyout offer is a 503 billion proposal made 
tuesday kroger publicly is still sticking to its commitment to 
restructure itself and remain independent rather than be taken 
over but industry analysts say the kohlberg offer appears more 
lucrative to kroger shareholders which would prevent kroger 
management from simply shrugging off the kohlberg offer 
haft made his statement after learning rival kohlberg had 
increased its bid tuesday for kroger which is based in cincinnati 
the hafts of landover md opened the kroger bidding sept 19 
with an unsolicited offer of 55 per share or 432 billion the 
hafts have made no offer to increase their proposal 
kohlberg in the best deal to date proposes paying 50 in cash 
11 in debentures and a continuing equity interest in the company 
valued at 3 for each of krogers 786 million shares a deal 
worth 64 a share 
kroger has offered in its restructuring program which would 
require layoffs and sale of some company stores and food processing 
plants to pay shareholders a 40 cash dividend a debenture with a 
trading value of 8 and a stub share of stock that company 
officials say will trade at between 9 and 13 per share 
wall street investors however estimate the stubs value at as 
low as 5 per share 
if kroger were to turn to the hafts for help the family would 
not represent a friendly alternative said gary giblen an analyst 
with houston investment adviser rotan mosle inc they are hardly 
white knights theyre more like gray knights giblen said 
this is not the first time the hafts have competed with kohlberg 
for a takeover target but in the past companies have made deals 
with kohlberg to be rescued from the hafts 
it would be pretty funny to welcome the hafts in with open 
arms giblen said usually you welcome kohlberg this is a real 
switcharoo 
at least four shareholders lawsuits have been filed against 
kroger contending that its restructuring plan would not be in the 
shareholders best interests 
the 105yearold kroger co has 170000 employees and 52000 
shareholders the companys main businesses are its supermarkets 
and convenience stores

wheat prices hit new contract highs amid continued hope for a

soybeans were 10 cents lower to 2 cents higher with november at 
812 a bushel 
cattle prices surged at the chicago mercantile exchange where 
traders bought on ideas that supplies will tighten up in the fourth 
quarter they seemed to ignore nearterm fundamentals of lackluster 
boxed beef sales and slow feedyard trade both indications that 
demand is slight said philip stanley an analyst in chicago with 
thompson mckinnon securities inc 
the hog market fell under the influence of lower cash hog 
prices while pork bellies were pressured because of large stocks 
in storage stanley said

technical factors earlier in the session at the new york mercantile 
exchange 
the november contract for west texas intermediate rose 6 cents 
to settle at 1266 a barrel but other contract months settled as 
much as 15 cents lower the nearterm contract had been up as much 
as 30 cents during the session 
among refined products traded on the exchange the november 
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 06 cent to settle at 
3950 cents a gallon while home heating oil slipped 052 cent to 
3724 cents a gallon other contract months finished lower

the reported talks on texas air corp possibly 
selling its troubled eastern airlines subsidiary to rival trans 
world airlines inc bring two former bitter foes back together 
carl icahn head of twa and frank lorenzo chairman of texas 
air are tenacious financiers who warred over control of twa three 
years ago 
a lot has changed since then for both men and for the wild 
world of the deregulated airline business 
lorenzo whose texas air empire went on to acquire eastern for 
676 million after his twa bid failed apparently has decided that 
running an unwieldy and fractious airline company is too much 
trouble 
he is believed to be looking to sell parts or all of miamibased 
eastern which has been frought with labor difficulty and 
staggering losses before and since lorenzo took over 
for icahn a wellknown takeover strategist who has chased 
mammothsized companies ranging from usx corp to texaco inc in 
the past few years the acquisition of eastern would make his the 
largest us airline in terms of revenue passenger miles an 
industry measurement of capacity 
according to figures of the air transport association a 
washington trade group eastern and twas combined capacity last 
year totaled 689 billion revenue passenger miles the leading us 
airline last year in capacity was united with 662 billion revenue 
passenger miles 
easterns militant workers who have persistently characterized 
lorenzo as a union buster have been included in talks with icahn 
on the possible sale of the airline to him sources familiar with 
the situation said thursday 
in an ironic twist that recalls the move by twas workers in 
1985 to talk with icahn about possibly buying that airline which 
lorenzo was seeking in order to strengthen the operations of his 
other carrier continental 
at that time twas pilots and machinists promised icahn 
hundreds of millions of dollars in labor concessions if he took 
control largely because they feared lorenzo would gut twa and 
replace them with lowerpaid workers a strategy lorenzo had used 
at continental earlier 
after a seesaw struggle that lasted for several months icahn 
acquired a controlling stake in twa as part of a broader 
arrangement to eventually take the airline private which is 
expected to be completed soon lorenzos texas air got about 50 
million for selling its interest in twa to icahn 
since the twa takeover icahn has faced his own labor problems 
beginning with a bitter strike by flight attendants in 1986 that 
left thousands out of work replaced by new hires at lower pay 
although the strike failed the flight attendants union has 
continued to challenge icahn and petitioned the department of 
transportion to review his fitness to run the airline earlier this 
year 
more recently icahn has incurred the wrath of twas pilots who 
claim he broke promises to them when he initially acquired control 
of the airline the pilots have sued him on grounds he is borrowing 
against the airlines properties without making crucial longterm 
investments in equipment 
the solvency of the airline is in question twa pilots union 
chief thomas ashwood said in announcing the lawsuit last month 
we wont stand idly by while carl icahn strips our airline of 
assets and keeps it from growing financially stronger from buying 
airplanes and from improving service to our passengers because of 
heavy debt 
icahn has denied the charges of both unions saying he was 
dismayed by their actions

would get their first general pay increases since 1981 as well as 
boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security under terms 
of a tentative contract agreement 
the contract proposal between deere and the united auto workers 
calls for an average pay raise of 44 cents per hour in the first 
year of the proposed threeyear contract according to thursdays

1547 per hour or 32177 per year based on a 40hour week 
the newspaper citing unidentified sources within the company 
and the union reported that deere workers would receive bonuses of 
approximately 3 percent paid in lump sums in each of the next two 
years of the contract 
deeres union work force has not received a general pay raise 
since 1981 it has given costofliving increases using a formula 
tied to the consumer price index 
besides wage hikes the union won a threestep increase in early 
retirement benefits the paper reported 
in the contracts first year the monthly pension benefit for 
those on early retirement would jump from 1205 to 1400 the 
monthly benefit would reach 1500 in the second year and 1600 in 
the final year of the pact

times of high inventories labor disputes plant closings sale of 
a division of the company or an act of god

session deere and the uaw negotiated daily for nearly two months 
before the settlement was announced at 508 am saturday more 
than five hours after the current labor contract expired 
the new contract would take effect immediately upon ratification 
and would run through midnight sept 30 1991

ashland oil inc thursday entered a not guilty 
plea and asked for a jury trial on criminal negligence charges in 
the jan 2 tank collapse that fouled two major rivers with diesel 
fuel 
a spokesman for the kentuckybased company which publicly 
admitted errors that figured in the collapse declined to say 
whether ashland attorneys are attempting to negotiate a bargain 
with prosecutors 
were having conversations with the us attorney were still 
interested in doing that said ashland spokesman dan lacy 
a federal grand jury on sept 15 returned a twocount indictment 
accusing ashland of violating the clean water act and the 1899 
refuse act prosecutors say neither law requires the government to 
prove the pollution was intentional 
if convicted on both counts ashland could be fined 400000 
plus double the damage caused by the spill 
the spill occurred when a steel tank at the companys floreffe 
terminal burst as it was being filled for the first time since the 
world war iiera structure was dismantled near cleveland and 
reassembled south of pittsburgh 
an independent study blamed the collapse on a dimesize flaw 
near one of the welds used in reassembling the tank 
besides failing to obtain all the necessary local permits to 
erect the tank ashland admitted violating industry standards by 
not filling the vessel with water to test its strength 
ashland chairman john hall said jan 27 that employees 
responsible for moving the tank were told more than a year earlier 
about faulty welds in the vessel walls a memo describing the 
faults wasnt uncovered by senior management until nearly three 
weeks after the tank collapsed he said 
ashland maintains it is unfairly being prosecuted 
weve spent 13 million in reimbursements and cleanup costs 
lacy said we dont feel that any of our conduct justifies a 
criminal penalty 
an estimated 38 million gallons of oil gushed from the tank as 
it crumpled most of the oil was contained by a dike but an 
estimated 715000 gallons entered the monongahela river and flowed 
into the ohio 
tap water service was discontinued to 23000 suburban pittsburgh 
residents for a week after the spill and water supplies for nearly 
a million other residents in three states along the ohio river was 
threatened

the formidable price tags on 
1989 mercedesbenz automobiles will rise a modest 17 percent over 
1988 and the company is testing a new usedcar warranty program 
officials said thursday 
prices for the west germanmade luxury cars will range from 
30980 for the 190 diesel sedan to 79840 for the twodoor 
560sec 
the bestselling car in the united states is the ford escort 
with a base price of about 7500 less than a tenth of the 
560secs sticker 
erich krampe president and chief executive officer of 
mercedesbenz of north america inc said he doesnt expect any 
price fluctuations in 1989 because of the exchange rate between the 
us dollar and the west german mark 
he said he was happy with the companys sales performance 
despite slipping a little from last years level of about 80000 
cars he said during the past year mercedes had restructured 
itself and its paying off 
the luxury car market of which mercedes holds a significant 
share will continue to grow krampe said and competition in it 
will increase as toyota and nissan introduce their lexus and 
infiniti lines next year 
the overall luxury market there is a lot of steam in there 
krampe added 
but along with holding its volume of new car sales about the 
same level mercedes is looking at improving its usedcar 
operations through a pilot warranty program in 20 dealerships 
nationwide 
we want to test how it works on the dealer level customers 
and our own administration krampe said 
for cars less than 8 years old and with less than 100000 miles 
the program would offer a 12month bumpertobumper warranty the 
program started a few weeks ago and will be assessed in december 
krampe said 
dealers would set the cost of the warranty 
officials said about 60 percent of the new mercedes sold are 
bought by former mercedes owners the cars retain 65 to 70 percent 
of their original value in two years and 40 percent to 45 percent 
after five years they added 
all of the new 89 mercedes will be equipped with antilock 
brake systems and driverside air bags some cars will have 
passengerside air bags as standard equipment 
the average new mercedes buyer is 40 to 43 years old and comes 
from a household with an income of about 100000 annually krampe 
said

scherer both children of the companys late founder and members of 
the board of directors who lead the shareholder group pressing for 
the sale of the company

victories for rp scherer stockholders who now are several steps 
closer than they were a week ago to maximizing their investments

the environmental protection agency has failed 
to act against tens of thousands of violations of the safe drinking 
water act by local water systems the national wildlife federation 
said thursday 
there has been a major breakdown in administration of the 
1974 law said jay hair executive vice president of the 
federation at a news conference 
the federation whose 5 million members make it the nations 
largest environmental organization released a report of an 
18month examination of 15000 pages of epa computer printouts for 
the 1987 fiscal year that showed 36763 water systems committing 
101588 violations of the act the nation has over 200000 water 
systems 
though the law requires that every violation be reported to 
customers of the system only 5867 notices were issued the 
federation did not count failure to issue notices in its survey of 
violations if it had they would have numbered 197309 
of the violations said norman dean federation staff lawyer and 
principal author of the report 17506 were violations of 
enforceable contaminant standards and the rest were monitoring and 
reporting violations which both he and the agency consider 
potentially more serious 
monitoring and reporting requirements are the heart of the 
law the study said they enable the identification and 
correction of public health risks before they blossom into crises 
seventy percent of the contaminant violations were for exceeding 
bacteriological standards 20 percent involved inorganic chemicals 
or substances like metals or arsenic 06 percent were organic 
chemicals such as pesticides 09 percent were radioactivity 
violations and 77 percent were turbidity sediment violations 
according to deans figures 
theres no excuse for a public water system to be distributing 
water that exceeds the bacteriological standards said dean 
since bacteria are easily killed by cheap wellunderstood 
chlorination 
the law permits states to run drinking water protection programs 
approved by epa if their standards and procedures are as tough as 
the federal standards only indiana wyoming and the district of 
columbia have opted to leave epa with direct authority in those 
jurisdictions 
dean said a 1982 report on lax enforcement by the general 
accounting office led congress to remove enforcement discretion 
from epa in 1986 changing the statute to read that epa shall 
take enforcement action against every violation if the state does 
not do so in 30 days before the law read that epa may act 
but what action is needed is left to epa the maximum penalty is 
a fine of 25000 a day for each violation rarely imposed 
peter cook deputy director of epas office of drinking water 
said all regulatory agencies must have enforcement discretion 
when epa finds a violation it is our position that it need not 
be an enforcement action that follows 
its important to understand that if enforcement actions are 
not taken the states are aggressive in protecting the public 
health through boil water announcements requirements for 
provision of bottled water and similar measures cook said 
small systems almost twothirds of the total serve fewer than 
500 people may have difficulty raising money cook said it may 
take some time for this community to float a loan to upgrade 
treatment systems youre talking about years it doesnt make a 
lot of sense if you have a cooperative community which is moving 
ahead to beat them over the head with penalties that they cant 
afford anyway 
hair said there is no question discretion must be used but 
the agency must do something for a firsttime violator and a 
minor violation no fine would be appropriate dean said a 
simple compliance order and a public admonishment would suffice 
were not talking about calibrating the enforcement dial a 
little bit said hair were talking about tens of thousands of 
violations 
hair said the federation made no attempt to assess health risks 
to the public from the violations but he and dean noted that epa 
had estimated that 110000 illnesses arose in the population 
between 1971 and 1985 from waterborne disease and some experts 
believe there may actually have been 25 times as many cases 
people worried about their water may get it tested by a private 
lab but a full rundown on organic and inorganic chemicals can cost 
more than 200 more than the average person should be asked to 
do hair said 
epa established a tollfree telephone number 15 months ago to 
answer question about drinking water 8004264791 and jeremy 
rowland the contractor operating it said calls now run about 200 
a day about half come from local and state government agencies and 
water systems seeking information and half from the general public 
of the public callers he estimated three quarters were worried 
about water quality and a quarter were people saying were 
overregulated and our water bills are too high 
at the american water works association the trade association 
of private and publicly operated water supply systems deputy 
executive director jack sullivan said he did not doubt the 
federations figures and also did not doubt that many violations 
that should have been punished were not 
but sullivan echoed cooks comment that many systems were 
financially strapped were going to have to say to some of these 
smaller systems youre going to have to have financial 
capability or were going to force you into a regional system 
something the state of connecticut is doing sullivan said

believes it needs about 540 million over three years in pay cuts 
and other concessions to turn itself around the contract with the 
transport workers would have saved the airline about 81 million 
over the next three years according to both the union and pan am

payments to the united auto workers union the national right to 
work legal defense foundation said 
the classaction lawsuit seeks to remove the fee requirement for 
22000 state employees represented by uaw local 6000 several 
thousand of whom arent union members

noncollective bargaining activities they oppose the springfield 
vabased foundation said in a statement released in detroit 
beginning oct 13 nonmembers will be required to pay socalled 
agency fees nearly equal to union dues the statement said

president said in a separate statement and the state of 
michigan is a willing accomplice and must be held accountable

mexico plans to file an energetic protest 
with the organization of petroleum exporting countries over the 
failure of some cartel members to stay within their production 
quotas according to a report here 
the government oil monopoly pemex on tuesday blamed opec 
overproduction for the glut on world markets that caused petroleum 
prices to reach a twoyear low this week 
oil prices also have been depressed by speculation that opec 
overproduction would continue in the nearfuture due to 
disagreements among cartel members over output quotas 
mexico the worlds sixthlargest oil producer does not belong 
to opec but closely monitors the 13member cartels pricing and 
production policies 
the excelsior news service on thursday quoted an official with 
the energy mines and stateowned industries department as saying 
the government planned an energetic protest against opec members 
for the lack of seriousness and responsibility in meeting their 
fixed production platforms 
the department oversees pemexs operations 
excelsior quoted the department official as saying mexico had 
lost 2 billion in anticipated revenue so far in 1988 because of 
depressed market prices 
a department spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
refused to confirm the excelsior report but said the government 
soon would decide what action if any it would take towards opec 
rogelio sotomayor chairman of the chamber of deputies treasury 
committee said wednesday that mexico would maintain its oil 
exports at current levels to generate necessary revenue and avoid 
government cuts in social spending 
citing opec overproduction mexico on tuesday announced it had 
cut the price of its light crude exports to asia from 1350 to 
1180 a barrel 
mexico produces about 25 million barrels of crude a day and 
exports 135 million barrels a day about half of that to the 
united states according to pemex 
first quarter oil exports accounted for 18 billion in revenue 
according to the national statistics institute crude exports 
generated 79 billion in all of 1987

allegheny international inc is calling on its 
investors to submit by monday any plans they may have for 
reorganizing the financially troubled consumer products company 
among those interested in controlling the company is victor 
kiam president and chief executive of the shaver manufacturer 
remington products inc kiam who has a stake in the company is 
reviewing confidential financial information allegheny 
international said 
management said it also held talks with los angeles 
multimillionaire david h murdock who first offered more than two 
years ago to take over the company 
allegheny international has been operating under protection from 
creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code since 
february the companys management is willing to step aside if 
required under an acceptable reorganization plan although a 
successful plan might keep the current management in place said 
company spokesman edward m romonoff 
a stockholders plan filed within the last week calls for 
stockholders to keep 50 percent of the reorganized company and to 
receive rights to buy another 30 percent for 30 million the plan 
would give an outside investor such as kiam rights to the rest of 
the company for 20 million the management team under chairman 
oliver s travers jr would be replaced 
the shareholders plan would pay creditors between 50 percent 
and full value for their claims 
managements reorganization plan has been criticized by every 
major creditor group it calls for bankers and creditors of 
alleghenys sunbeam corp subsidiary to be repaid in full while 
other creditors would get 60 cents to 85 cents on the dollar and 
shareholders interests would be diluted by 75 percent 
allegheny management has the exclusive right to submit a 
reorganization plan through oct 27 although us bankruptcy judge 
joseph l cosetti last month said he would accept plan outlines 
from committess representing shareholders unsecured creditors and 
sunbeams creditors 
meanwhile allegheny international sent letters to four former 
officers including former chairman robert j buckley calling in 
lowinterest loans of more than 43 million made to them in the 
early 1980s the company said the loans would be due in full oct 
22 unless the men begin making payments 
all four claim in separate complaints filed with the court that 
they should not have to repay the money until allegheny 
international restores benefits taken away by the board in march 
1987

the senate on thursday seized one of the most 
popular issues of the presidential campaign and on a 940 vote 
approved a tax exemption for interest on us savings bonds that 
are used to finance a college education 
wading into two even bigger issues taxes and drugs the 
senate for the time being refused to raise taxes on cigarettes and 
alcohol to help pay for a 26 billion bipartisan antidrug bill 
a 6033 vote killed the amendment by sen warren rudman rnh 
that would have raised the 16cent cigarette tax by two cents and 
added five cents to the price of a sixpack of beer or bottle of 
wine and 30 cents to a fifth of liquor 
the amendment is likely to come up again next week when the 
senate considers the big drug measure itself 
i know the president of my party and the presidential nominee 
of my party are against new taxes and i am pretty much against new 
taxes said rudman but are we going to let this problem get 
away from us 
sen max baucus dmont manager of the tax bill said the 
entire bill would have been killed if rudmans amendment had been 
adopted the white house believes this is not the way to raise 
money to fight the war on drugs he said 
the lawmakers made quick work of another hot question killing 
on a 5639 vote an effort by sen gordon humphrey rnh that 
would have repealed tax exemptions of abortion clinics 
the action came as the senate worked on a bill whose main 
purpose is to correct errors and misunderstandings in the 1986 tax 
overhaul 
the measure also includes some tax breaks worth about 27 
billion over three years and the tax increases to pay for them a 
larger bill with a 75 billion price tag has been approved by 
the house and there is no assurance a compromise can be agreed on 
by both chambers before adjournment 
the senate bill has benefits for farmers and other offroad 
users of diesel fuel firsttime homebuyers corporate research 
efforts and workers who receive educational or legal assistance 
from employers the measure includes a bill of rights for 
taxpayers involved in disputes with the internal revenue service 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
and human resources committee offered the savingsbond amendment 
he introduced it last year and president reagan included it in his 
budget earlier this year 
kennedy described his savingsbond proposal which is not in the 
house bill as a simple sensible way ram 
under the provision the interest on any savings bond used to 
pay for costs of a college or vocational education would be 
taxexempt all savings bonds already are taxdeferred until 
redeemed in addition they are exempt from state and local taxes 
thr would simply not report that interest as taxable income 
the full exemption from federal tax would be available to 
familieswhose adjusted gross incomes are under 60000 a year the 
benefit would be reduced gradually as income rises between 60000 
and 70000 67 percent of the interest would be exempt between 
70000 and 79999 34 percent would be exempt once income 
reaches 80000 no bond interest would be allowed 
those figures would be adjusted each year to reflect inflation 
the education benefit would be paid for by limiting the personal 
tax exemption allowed fulltime students 24 years or older who are 
still claimed as dependents by their parents under kennedys 
proposal the parents could take the exemption only if they provide 
at least half the support of the student and the student has income 
of less than 1950 
kennedys proposal is similar to one advocated by vice president 
george bush the republican nominee for president 
the democratic candidate gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
has offered a new loan program that students would pay back through 
payroll deductions after they complete their education 
kennedy said his plan is simple riskfree for investors good 
for the nations savings rate and convenient but ultimately i 
believe that the most important feature of this proposal is simply 
that it sends a loud clear message about our priorities he said 
not voting on the savings bond interest exemption were sens

interco inc asked a federal appeals 
court thursday to order a judge to hear its claim that an investor 
group was improperly pursuing a 266 billion takeover attempt 
interco maintains the hostile buyout attempt by a group led by 
the washington dcbased rales brothers violates security and 
exchange commission regulations by being too highly leveraged 
us judge william hungate has issued a stay barring litigation 
in the case making it impossible for interco to seek a judgment in 
the matter interco asked a threejudge panel of the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals in an expedited appeal to order hungate to 
hear its claim 
interco based in st louis has rebuffed the groups overtures 
since it first offered 64 a share in july on sept 20 interco 
announced its board of directors had rejected a revised 
conditional 72ashare offer and had instead adopted a major 
restructuring and recapitalization program that might include the 
sale of some of its major businesses 
interco chairman harvey saligman said the restructuring plan was 
worth 76 a share 
the company is a a diversified manufacturer of furniture and 
apparel whose lines include ethan allen furniture london fog 
outerwear and florsheim shoes 
cardinal acquisition the group led by brothers mitchell and 
stephen rales has acquired about 8 percent of interco stock in a 
tender offer that expires oct 11 
the group is pursuing a leveraged buyout of interco in such a 
deal a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are 
repaid with money raised through the companys cash flow or by the 
sale of its assets 
interco contends the amount of money cardinal acquisition would 
have to borrow is greater than limits set by sec 
cardinal acquisition argued before the appeals court that the 
matter should be settled in delaware courts interco is 
incorporated in delaware and noted a federal judge there had 
refused to block the takeover attempt 
attorneys said every effort interco has taken to block the 
takeover until now had been taken in delaware courts 
interco attorneys said hungate had refused to hear the question 
because there were other avenues open but contended none of the 
alternatives showed a likelihood for success in time and others 
were unfeasible 
judge john gibson said the appeals panel court would issue an 
order as soon as we can 
the hearing was held in kansas city because all judges of the 
8th circuit were here for to discuss internal court matters

the reagan administration on thursday appealed 
a federal judges ruling that the government could not force ailing 
ltv corp to reassume some 3 billion in pension obligations 
the pension benefit guaranty corp the government agency which 
insures pensions for some 40 million workers filed the appeal with 
the 2nd circuit us court of appeals in new york 
the appeal seeks to overturn as a dangerous precedent a 
ruling last june by us district judge robert w sweet of new york 
that the pbgc could not make ltv reassume the pension obligations 
simply because ltv had signed new contracts restoring previously 
cut health and welfare benefits 
the appeals court must decide whether federal insurance should 
protect retirees or provide corporate welfare to profitable 
companies said kathleen p utgoff the agencys executive 
director 
ltv terminated three pension plans covering some 100000 workers 
and retirees of its steel subsidiary after the company filed for 
bankruptcy reorganization in 1986 listing some 6 billion in 
liabilities 
the biggest of the liabilities 3 billion were the pension 
plans which then had assets of just 1 billion to cover benefits 
for some 100000 ltv workers and retirees 
when ltv terminated the pension plans the federal agency became 
ltvs single biggest creditor assuming responsibility for the 2 
billion in uncovered pension liabilities 
however the agency does not insure related health and welfare 
retirement benefits promised by ltv to its workers 
when ltv signed new contracts with the united steel workers and 
united mine workers unions restoring those benefits last year the 
agency tried to turn the pension plans back over to the company 
saying ltv was taking unfair advantage of the federal insurance 
program to cut costs and buy labor peace 
sweet ruled that the pbgc had shown no factual or legal 
basis that the company had abused the pension insurance program 
but said he was willing to reconsider the issue with some 
additional fact finding by the agency 
pbgc officials in washington said thursday that the agency chose 
to appeal sweets ruling to a higher court rather than seek a new 
hearing based on the additional fact finding
