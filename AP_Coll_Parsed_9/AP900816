disagreement by the two sides 
over whether to kick dozens of allegedly corrupt officers out of 
the army could push el salvador into another round of civil war 
on july 26 government and rebel negotiators ended a third 
session of monthly unmediated peace talks with an accord on 
human rights they are to meet again friday in san jose costa rica 
julys agreements skirted armed forces reform the main item on 
the peace agenda and the key to ending a decadelong war that has 
killed an estimated 72000 people most of them civilians 
salvadorans barely recovered from the bloody rebel offensive of 
november 1989 are waiting for the other shoe a combat boot they 
expect will crash down in the next few weeks 
leftist rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
known as the fmln have warned of another major attack unless the 
government agrees to steps toward demilitarization 
acrimonious debate of the militarys role has occupied more than 
90 percent of the negotiating time and produced only cosmetic 
changes in positions with no agreement each side accuses the 
other of intransigence 
the army has been on alert since early july soldiers with 
assault rifles are everywhere on downtown and suburban streets 
patrolling or manning roadblocks 
forced recruitment of young men has increased soldiers 
routinely stop intercity buses to induct those who cannot prove 
they have served already 
last month citizens frightened by rumors of an imminent 
guerrilla offensive stocked up on beans a staple of the salvadoran 
diet driving up the price 
seven points are on the peace agenda but both sides agree the 
only really sticky one is what to do about the army 
el salvador has held periodic elections since 1982 and tried to 
consolidate some democratic institutions but the military retains 
tremendous influence 
the main obstacle to an armistice that would disband the fmln is 
the dispute over the rebels insistence that the high command be 
purged of officers they accuse of corruption and abusing human 
rights the government and armed forces say that would amount to 
interference with the military 
oscar santamaria the chief government negotiator said in an 
interview the fmln position appears designed to cripple the 
armed forces rather than to change or reform them 
president alfredo cristianis rightist government has proposed 
letting the armed forces police themselves the rebels say history 
shows the army cannot be trusted to do that 
despite evidence implicating the military in torture 
disappearances and thousands of murders no officer has been 
convicted of a crime involving the politically motivated abuse of 
human rights 
they are saying trust us were going to be good from now 
on said schafik handal a guerrilla commander and the chief 
rebel negotiator if we lay down our arms before agreeing on a 
purge and an end to military impunity there would be another 
bloodbath like that of the early 1980s 
guerrilla demands for a purge and a drastic reduction in the 
armys numerical strength have struck a chord in a people who 
traditionally view the army with a mixture of fear and contempt 
chafarote the popular term for soldier is a combination of 
words meaning falseness and filth 
i dont like the guerrillas but i completely agree with their 
demand for a purge and demilitarization said the owner of a tile 
factory the military has been a scourge for this country 
as often happens in this violent nation he asked that his name 
not be used 
sen christopher dodd a connecticut democrat who follows 
central american affairs closely said in july that 40 to 50 
salvadoran officers should be retired early or otherwise removed 
guerrilla spokesmen talk of purging 200 officers but that is 
seen as a negotiating figure subject to change the rebels demand 
only removal not trials and punishment 
col mauricio vargas a brigade commander and member of the 
government negotiating team agreed that the military could benefit 
from a change in its upper echelons but said the process must be 
gradual and internal 
he said in an interview that about 10 top officers could be 
removed in the next year but that a more drastic housecleaning 
would irreparably damage the command structure 
the united states provides about 1 million a day in economic 
and military aid to el salvador earlier this year the state 
department and us embassy appeared to be seeking some sort of 
military shakeup but recent comments indicate washington has eased 
the pressure

in a petition filed with the national labor 
relations board a technical union at nbc accused the company of 
unfair labor practices nbc immediately denied the accusations

fouryear contract proposal that a majority of the unions members 
at nbc have rejected twice

facilities accused the company of failing and refusing to 
bargain in good faith its previous contract expired on march 31 
nbc has fully met its obligations under the national labor 
relations act said nbc spokesman joe rutledge who said the 
companys final offer came after more than seven months of 
negotiations and 35 separate meetings 
were confident that just as when nabet filed a similar 
complaint in 1987 the nlrb will find the charges without merit 
the 1987 charge was filed during a bitter strike by the union 
that lasted 17 weeks no walkout this time is imminent no strike 
vote has been taken and union officials say theyll probably go to 
court to fight nbcs action

at the grand ole opry steamy days in the south nights even hotter 
shes an aspiring country music singer and her love affair with 
a married man is the towns gossip the town is nashville and the 
man is the mayor 
traci peel 34 and mayor bill boner 45 have caught nashville 
up in a dixie drama that sounds more like tennessee williams than 
tennessee government theyve even made the headlines of 
supermarket tabloids 
boner who left congress in 1986 under the cloud of an ethics 
investigation announced in july that he and peel are engaged 
that turned some heads 
the mayor is still married to his third wife betty and at the 
time his engagement was announced the estranged boners were living 
under the same roof with their 4yearold son 
boner said he met peel in may at a golf tournament and the 
relationship progressed until july 20 
thats the day their romance hit the newsstands when the 
nashville banner contacted boner and peel at her residence for an 
interview 
the banner reported that peel told a reporter boners passion 
could last for seven continuous hours 
thats pretty good for a 46yearold man peel said 
fortyfive corrected boner who was on an extension 
peel denies the comments the banner stands by the story and 
notes that neither peel nor boner has asked for a correction 
within days the quote prompted bumper stickers proclaiming 
seven hours for traci three years for metro boners been 
mayor for three years and has one more year to go 
peel sings in nashville nightclubs and is occasionally joined by 
boner who pulls out a harmonica and accompanies her 
that scene prompted one editorial cartoonist to depict boner as 
the nero of nashville fiddling while nashville struggles with 
garbage water quality and other urban problems 
the romance has become the stuff supermarket tabloids are made 
of in their headlines boner has become a sexmad mayor peel a 
country queen and their relationship the grand old soap 
opry 
the syndicated television program a current affair had its 
shot too calling the romance nashvilles latest hee haw after 
the longrunning syndicated television series 
the publicity has irked peel who telephoned a radio talk show 
tuesday to complain the news media was making nashville look like 
hee haw 
its a sad sad day when they have to mock our leaders i 
dont care who they are peel said on wlac 
peel who has been given a 22carat diamond ring by boner told 
the associated press on wednesday that she has little more to say 
other than she wishes the media would leave her alone 
youve heard everything i had to say she said just tell 
it the way i said it 
boner a democrat who decided before all this excitement not to 
seek reelection refused comment about the matter wednesday 
were hoping it will go away said his press secretary rick 
runyeon 
on his weekly appearance tuesday on an ask your mayor 
television segment boner said the story has taken on a life of its 
own 
i dont have a thing to do with how the media chooses to 
promote whatever they want to promote boner said its been a 
series of misquotes and drawing things out of proportion 
the romance has ignited a flurry of letters to local newspapers 
in a letter to the nashville banner susan murphy complained 
that the media should concentrate on reporting other news more 
useful to citizens 
a better informed voter is more likely to elect concerned 
public servants and less inclined to elect donothing politicians 
such as the harmonicaplaying romeo currently occupying the mayors

saddam husseins sudden move to end a 
standoff with iran his enemy in the 198088 gulf war indicates he 
may plan to tough it out in his desert confrontation with the 
united states over the invasion of kuwait 
by making a deal with iran saddam would do much to secure his 
vulnerable eastern flank along the 730mile border with iran while 
he faces a mounting buildup by us and allied forces in saudi 
arabia 
baghdad announced wednesday that saddam was prepared 
unconditionally to withdraw his troops from iranian territory 
occupied in the closing stages of the eightyear persian gulf 
conflict exchange prisoners and relinquish a claim of sovereignty 
over the disputed shattalarab waterway 
those were key obstacles in peace talks with iran and saddams 
concessions show how much he is willing to compromise in order to 
stand up to the americans and prove himself the new arab strongman 
who will challenge israel 
saddam said he was looking forward to a new life of 
cooperation with iran and suggested the two countries had a 
common cause in an effort to deter those fishing in dirty 
waters of the persian gulf 
negotiations for a peace treaty between iraq and iran to 
formally end their war have been deadlocked virtually since they 
began five days after the unsponsored ceasefire took hold aug 
20 1988 
the iranians frustrated at what they claim was saddams 
stonewalling in the peace talks threatened several times to take 
back iraqiheld territory in the central and southern sectors if 
necessary 
but in the last few months saddam has been trying to find a 
facesaving formula to end the standoff he and president hashemi 
rafsanjani of iran exchanged letters over several weeks and spoke 
of holding a peace summit 
now saddams package of concessions is an attempt to speed up 
the process dramatically at a time when he has found himself in a 
tight squeeze because of his seizure of kuwait 
saddam has been looking for a political cover to make 
concessions for some time said analyst philip robbins of 
londons royal institute of international affairs 
by heating up the issue of confronting israel he gave himself 
an opportunity to show iran they have a common enemy robbins 
said in a telephone interview 
on sunday saddam linked his occupation of kuwait to israels 
control of the occupied territories and syrias occuption of parts 
of lebanon 
his invasion and annexation of kuwait aug 2 set up a highrisk 
confrontation with the united states that could well ignite the 
middle east in another conflagration if his current crusade against 
israel gains momentum 
the united nations imposed an economic blockade on iraq while 
the united states britain and other nations including some arab 
states sent forces to protect saudi arabia and enforce the un 
quarantine 
its a long way to go before hed climb down over kuwait but 
of course hes eating a lot of words in terms of iran and hes able 
to do that without losing face because of the position hes taken 
up as a kind of champion of the arab world said sir john 
moberly britains ambassador in baghdad in 198285 
he sees he has popularity in some sections of the arab 
world and a lot at home so he can afford to make concessions over 
iran moberly said in a british broadcasting corp interview 
recent reports by diplomats and other knowledgeable sources said 
that iraq has an estimated 200000 troops deployed in occupied 
sectors of iran and along the frontier that was the frontline for 
much of the gulf war 
it is possible that as many as half of those units could be 
pulled back and redeployed in the south to bolster the more than 
120000 iraqis facing the united states and its allies 
how quickly they could be moved will depend on how long it takes 
saddam to reach agreement with rafsanjani the iranians have 
welcomed saddams offer but while they have him over a barrel may 
try to squeeze all they can out of him 
iraq has a 1millionman military but only about 200000 of 
those troops including the elite republican guard divisions can 
be considered wellmotivated frontline fighters 
the iraqi army spent most of the gulf war fighting a static war 
behind awesome defenses by the time they went on the offensive in 
the closing months of the conflict the iranians were largely 
demoralized 
nonetheless the iraqis remain a formidable foe with some 5500 
tanks more than 500 combat aircraft battlefield missiles and an 
arsenal of chemical weapons 
saddams move appears to be aimed more at shoring up his 
defensive positions in the south than signalling any offensive 
action against the burgeoning us force massing in saudi arabia 
i wouldnt think hes spoiling for a fight moberly noted 
hes more likely simply to sit tight in kuwait and hope that as 
time passes the consensus that has built up in the international 
world against what hes done will begin to weaken 
saddams new move indicated that he fears the buildup of us 
and allied military strength will continue beyond the 50000man 
level announced by washington and with saddam responding with a 
buildup in his forces the possibility of a firefight increases 
with the un sanctions beginning to bite robbins suggested 
that saddams move wednesday could also benefit iraq in another way 
reducing tension on the iranian border will mean that 
smuggling can take place to circumvent the embargo he noted

in a war few outside poland recall 
soldiers of the newborn polish republic 70 years ago this week 
retaliated in a battle that saved warsaw from bolshevik conquest 
and the wrath of the red army 
until last year the polishsoviet war of 191920 was rarely 
discussed by polands former communist authorities because they 
correctly gauged local sensitivities about the miracle of the 
vistula 
but five days of observances about the battle that began aug 
13 1920 were organized in villages across poland for the first 
anniversary observance since the end of communist rule 
the miracle on the vistula has been recalled in churches and 
cemeteries throughout poland since sunday and memorials destroyed 
or removed during the reign of the communists have been carefully 
restored 
many historians put this battle among the dozen most important 
military acts prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said during a 
royal castle ceremony tuesday night honoring veterans of the battle 
if not for the polish determination if not for our sacrifice 
and our victory the history of europe would have been much 
different he told the elderly survivors 
ceremonies on wednesday at the tomb of the unknown soldier in 
warsaw and thursday at the krakow tomb of marshal jozef pilsudski 
the champion of polish independence who led the military campaign 
were to conclude observances that had captured polands emotions 
all week 
with central europe in collapse after world war i and the german 
workingclass excited by bolshevisms triumph in russia soviet 
leader vladimir lenin dreamed of conquering poland which would put 
the red army in mideurope and spread the socialist revolution 
across europe 
in the summer of 1920 five of the feared soviet armies 
converged on warsaw 
to the west over the corpse of white poland lies the road to 
worldwide conflagration soviet gen mikhail tukachevsky 
instructed his troops before the battle according to british 
historian norman davies 
white was lenins pejorative description meaning 
counterrevolutionary enemies of the workingclass the czarist army 
opposing the bolsheviks dressed in white 
barbedwire defenses hurriedly errected by warsaws residents 
held and in a series of daring maneuvers poles managed to encircle 
the soviets in days 100000 red army troops were taken prisoner 
and the rest fled to east prussia east prussia is former german 
territory now belonging to poland and the soviet union 
in poland the unexpected triumph came to be called the 
miracle on the vistula for the river that passes through warsaw 
had polish soldiers failed to arrest the triumphant advance 
of the soviet army at the battle of warsaw not only would 
christianity have experienced a dangerous reverse but the very 
existence of western civilization would have been imperiled 
wrote the thenbritish ambassador to berlin lord dabernon 
according to davies 
the attention focused on polands heroic effort continues today 
mazowiecki said thousands of people of all ages have been jamming 
memorial masses this week decorating their villages with ribbons 
in honor of the battle 
the world is paying great attention to our experiences now 
because it knows our process of freeing ourselves from communism 
has critical importance for the world mazowiecki said 
polish primate cardinal jozef glemp told worshippers that the 
battle is still going on referring to the trials of building a 
democratic society after four decades of oneparty rule 
glemp started the commemoration sunday at a country church in 
radzymin outside warsaw near a battlefield where a rebuilt 
cemetery chapel now honors the fallen soldiers 
among those attending was col stanislaw liskozlowski 84 a 
teenage volunteer from the polish boy scouts who shouldered a 
rifle against the bolsheviks in 1920 
liskozlowski who came from his home in buenos aires 
argentina stood outside the church his suit covered with medals 
that recalled his service with the antinazi resistance in world 
war ii and the doomed 1944 warsaw uprising 
he scoffed when a reporter suggested that as a 14yearold he 
was too young to fight in the uprising in 44 i had soldiers 12 
years old liskozlowski said 
for the soviets 1920 proved a temporary defeat stalins troops 
occupied more than half of poland in 1939 after world war ii 
communists took power and ruled until 1989 when the solidarity 
movement wrested power from the party and installed a noncommunist 
government 
many of the miracle on the vistula fighters perished among 
the 15000 captured polish army officers executed by the soviets at 
katyn and two other sites in 1940 in poland the crime often is 
viewed as stalins revenge for 1920

east germanys dreaded secret police force is 
dead but its chilling legacy still haunts the troubled nation 
on wednesday a top official of east germanys leading political 
party was suspended following allegations he worked for the secret 
police for 15 years 
once the heart of communist repression the secret police opened 
mail tapped phones spied on nearly everyone threw people in jail 
and kept its own arsenals 
east german officials say the secret police also harbored 
terrorists including some of west germanys most wanted fugitives 
all that came to a gradual end after the communists were toppled 
in december but the fallout forms a sinister undercurrent to this 
day 
earlier this week prosecutors in both countries said they were 
investigating allegations the secret police murdered some of those 
who ran afoul of the regime 
there has been rampant speculation about who may have been 
killed by the secret police 
the masscirculation west german newspaper bild said there is 
suspicion the secret police killed regime opponents in cold 
blood and tried to cover up the murders as accidents it says the 
victims included politicians show stars and athletes 
in the frontpage story wednesday bild raised the question of 
whether american singer dean reed was one of the victims 
reed who lived in east germany and was the darling of country 
music fans throughout the soviet bloc was found dead in a lake 
outside east berlin in june 1986 
erich honeckers communist regime said reed died in a tragic 
accident although rumors of foul play abound 
bild said reed had been considering moving back to the united 
states shortly before his death and the secret police may have 
wanted to kill him to prevent him from undermining what for the 
east german communists had been a propaganda coup 
the secret police known as the stasi once numbered about 
200000 fulltime workers and informants some say the number was 
actually higher 
virtually everyone had some kind of contact with the stasi at 
one time or another 
for many those contacts crossed the line from unavoidable 
encounters to active cooperation 
on wednesday morning a news magazine said that the general 
secretary of the christian democratic union martin kirchner was a 
paid informant for 15 years 
kirchner was even working for the intelligence network when he 
met last year with chancellor helmut kohl according to west 
germanys stern magazine 
his alleged mission was to bring back information to help stasi 
bosses prepare for the time after honeckers ouster on oct 18 
within hours after stern released its report kirchner the 
partys no 2 official was suspended pending investigation even 
though he had denied similar allegations in the past 
the east german christian democrats under prime minister lothar 
de maiziere are the nations dominant party 
kirchner isnt the first politician felled by alleged links to 
the stasi 
wolfgang schnur a leader of democratic start quit in march 
amid a furor over his reported ties to the stasi 
similar allegations also led to the resignation of ibrahim 
boehme as chief of the influential social democrats 
almost every week there have been fresh insights into stasis 
omnipresent role 
last month the democratically elected government in east berlin 
said the communists had harbored the notorious venezuelan terrorist 
carlos 
officials also believe the stasi knew well in advance of the 
april 1986 bombing of the la belle discotheque in west berlin 
the bombing left two american soldiers and a turkish woman dead 
and led to us air raids on libya 10 days later 
east germans have been arguing over what to do with former stasi 
agents since many people refuse to employ them 
but for the 82yearold former secret police boss the future 
seems fairly certain erich mielke is in jail pending investigation 
of criminal charges of abuse of power

a law graduate accused of making wisecracks on his 
bar exam application wishes the tests administrators would just 
lighten up 
i never meant to be disrespectful cute maybe said charles 
malloy 28 a 1989 graduate of southern methodist university law 
school 
the state board of legal examiners found nothing cute about 
malloys answers to four questions on the application it twice 
barred him from taking the exam 
last week a state appeals court told the board that malloy has 
a spirited bumptiousness but not a lack of moral character 
forced to test him the panel appointed by the state supreme court 
is refusing to release his score 
i cant get hired anywhere because the standard question is 
have you passed the bar and i have to go into this long story 
malloy said in todays dallas times herald in the meantime he is 
working on a masters degree in corporate tax law 
the board has said it will take the case all the way to the 
state supreme court 
malloy contended he wasnt being flip when he responded to a 
question asking why he was fired from an accounting firm in 1985 
with why dont you ask them and let me know because i have been 
wondering now for 3 years 
the second question was whether he had ever been charged with or 
convicted of a crime he was found innocent in 1987 of disorderly 
conduct and evading arrest after lecturing a police officer who had 
crashed a rowdy smu party 
he was charged the next year with failing to identify himself to 
police after he and two friends reportedly yelled into a broken

the lid has popped off tupperwares secret 
new product for 1990 and the plastic kitchenware giant is steamed 
the peoria journal star reported wednesday that tupperwares 
revolutionary new product line is a group of stackable 
microwave dishes 
the paper really did a number on us said alan luce 
tupperware vice president for administration this was a major 
product breakthrough for us it was not like a new tumbler or 
color this was a major secret 
the new line was to have been unveiled nationally aug 27 but 
the newspaper tuesday got a reporter inside a closed session of a 
tupperware convention when the product was introduced to a jubilant 
crowd of dealers and sales managers 
luce said the story ruined the fun surprise and excitement 
for conventioneers attending sessions later this week in peoria 
long beach calif and orlando fla 
weve got 110000 independent tupperware dealers in the united 
states we prefer that they know about our new products before the 
general public knows said lawrie pitcher platt spokeswoman at 
tupperware headquarters in orlando 
mayor jim maloof said his secretary received several calls from 
upset tupperware officials he said he called the newspaper to ask 
if the story could be pulled from its evening editions the paper 
refused 
i dont understand whats the big deal they had news and we 
went and got it said jack brimeyer assistant managing editor 
we didnt treat them any differently than any other business or 
news story 
the mayor also said he had heard tupperware had threatened to 
cancel its threeyear contract to hold conventions in peoria 
the company plans to hold its 1991 convention in hawaii for 
tupperwares 40th anniversary but luce said that had nothing to do 
with the tupperware flap 
the new line is called tupperwave its a ninepiece selection 
of casseroletype dishes and accessories that can be stacked 
threehigh in a microwave to allow simultaneous cooking of entrees 
side dishes and desserts 
in unveiling the product tuesday to tupperware representatives

the bush administration wants to use the 
persian gulf crisis and resulting gasoline price increases to 
push for oil drilling in an alaskan wildlife refuge and other 
environmentally sensitive areas 
once congress gets back the interior department and others 
will try to make a strong case for congress to act in allowing 
exploration of the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife 
refuge said tom derocco chief of public affairs for the minerals 
management service 
the white house also hopes the mideast turmoil and increasing 
gas prices will galvanize public opinion for exploration and 
drilling in some offshore areas 
now that people are having to pay higher prices at the gas 
pump theres a heightened awareness of the issue said steven 
goldstein chief spokesman for the interior department 
however president bush will not alter his june decision to 
block new drilling off most of california southern florida 
washington and oregon officials said that decision barred 
offshore oil activity in those areas for at least a decade 
energy secretary james watkins said wednesday the united states 
could use steppedup oil production and conservation to replace up 
to 90 percent of the oil supplies lost because of the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 
half the saving would come if americans accept conservation 
measures that for example would require them to keep tires 
properly inflated and drive within the speed limit he said 
increased oil production could require compromises on the 
environment watkins added 
the oil industry has pushed for years to open the northeastern 
alaska refuges 15millionacre coastal stretch to drilling in 
hopes that it contains huge deposits of oil and gas 
environmentalists see the refuge as a crucial test of bushs 
commitment following his pledge to be an environmental 
president they say the refuge is a national treasure with a 
complete spectrum of arctic ecosystems including a home for polar 
bears millions of birds and a calving area for the porcupine 
caribou herd 
bush has long wanted oil exploration in the alaska refuge but 
congress decreed in 1980 that it must give permission before any 
drilling can occur 
ben beach of the wilderness society said the middle east crisis 
likely will help the bush administration counter public opposition 
to oil development 
politically it makes it easier for them to push for 
exploration beach said 
interior secretary manuel lujan in a meeting with white house 
chief of staff john sununus deputy andy card got the goahead 
to start the drumbeat toward opening the alaska refuge said an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the administration also is interested in moving ahead with 
exploration in other states that have been protected by 
congressional moratoriums said goldstein of the interior 
department 
that could include areas offshore in north carolina bristol 
bay alaska south carolina and other coastal regions goldstein 
said the administration wants to see steppedup oil production off 
santa barbara county calif where drilling already is underway 
but the administration is not likely to invoke powers that allow 
the federal government to override local decisions when it is 
deemed in the national interest said goldstein 
sen ted stevens ralaska announced as congress left for its 
august recess that he will urge passage of legislation to open the 
way for exploring the alaska wildlife refuge 
that bill had languished in the wake of the exxon valdez oil 
spill last year in alaskas prince william sound left the coastline 
and wildlife covered with black muck 
lawmakers return from summer recess in midseptember 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said he hoped the persian gulf 
crisis will boost the chances of his bill to allow exploration of 
the refuge as one alternative if us oil imports exceed half of 
consumption imports account for 52 percent of us oil he said 
goldstein noted that lujan for months has been out there 
trying to tell people were becoming too dependent on foreign oil 
unfortunately the issue of offshore oil became very emotional he 
said 
there was a consistent line of tanker accidents now people 
are seeing something that is even more distressing to them they 
are paying more for gasoline he said

no longer hatchetwielding 
prohibitionists the national womans christian temperance union 
nevertheless is still battling the bottle 
but instead of busting up saloons the 500 delegates at the 
groups 116th annual convention have set their sights on the 
classroom hoping to steer youngsters away from booze as well as 
drugs and alcohol 
we believe in teaching children not to start drinking then 
someday well be able to sit back and watch legalized 
prohibition said its president rachel kelly of portland me 
the fourday convention opened wednesday 
the union which claims to be the worlds oldest and largest 
christian womens group with 150000 members in the united states 
and 350000 abroad also campaigns against abortion and pornography 
and establishes missionaries 
its members are in their mid50s on average and many are 
educators on joining they must sign an oath that they will not 
drink or smoke men can join only as honorary members 
founded in 1874 the evanston illbased union helped hasten 
passage of the 18th amendment in 1919 its members stormed 
speakeasies with hatchets until prohibition was repealed in 1933 
nowadays kelly said we do things quietly we dont march we 
dont shout we dont pound bibles 
wctu spokesman michael vitucci said prohibition failed because 
it had no reason 
in the 1920s many people were not educated about why they 
should avoid alcohol but now auto accidents drug abuse and crime 
linked to drinking have sobered up many people to the benefits of 
abstinence vitucci said 
these are very intelligent women who realize that the alcohol 
industry has a great stranglehold on this nation vitucci said 
the wctu believes that today with education our youth will 
hopefully place a selfprohibition on these substances 
the group has for years pressed congress to ban alcohol 
advertisements on television and to raise federal taxes on alcohol 
the alcohol industry has had a free ride long enough said wctu 
vice president merry lee christy 
the group publishes books and pamphlets for teenagers and 
adults its literature is used to teach the young from 
kindergarten to the us air force academy and us military 
academy about the damage that alcohol can cause 
children can join its loyal tolerance legion and teenagers can 
say no to alcohol in its youth tolerance council 
we have fun like everyone else we just dont drink said 
rodney perry a 17yearold delegate from milton 
at this convention the opening banquet featured chicken and 
rice pilaf there was no cocktail hour 
our happy hour starts when we sit down to eat said doris

americas streets and campuses which rang 
with protest in the era of vietnam are quiet as the bush 
administration challenges iraqs saddam hussein in the persian 
gulf they may or may not stay that way 
from washington to san francisco protest demonstrations have 
been few and poorly attended since the united states sent troops to 
saudi arabia in response to saddams aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
summer school is winding up at the nations colleges and 
universities and most students are away but even for summer the 
response has been notably calm 
one reason is that americans view saddam as a villain whereas 
many thought the united states overreached in its bombing of north 
vietnam according to experts who have observed antiwar movements 
both from within and from without 
here is a case where there is an absolute clear aggressor in 
peoples minds said neil smelser a professor of sociology at 
the university of california in berkeley who studies social 
movements of political protest 
an associated press poll conducted last week showed 64 percent 
approval for the use of us troops to defend saudi arabia against 
possible iraqi attack 
this could change said smelser who was teaching at berkeley 
during the vietnam war when the campus was the scene of violent 
demonstrations 
its a delicate thing he said if there is the slightest 
move that could be interpreted by our own people that we are 
overstepping or making an illegitimate move it is very easy to see 
the possibility of the kind of protest that has been seen in 
vietnam and central america arising 
todd gitlin a sociology department colleague of smelser who was 
a leader of the militant students for a democratic society during 
the southeast asian war said he would not be surprised if there 
were protests when students return next month 
however gitlin said the only scenario in which i could 
imagine protest of the vietnam magnitude would be one in which a 
great deal of damage is done to american forces and people dont 
feel that the intervention is legitimate 
there is not a lot of love lost for saddam hussein he 
added i think many people on the left who are suspicious of 
american intervention dont like saddam hussein they dont 
like what he did 
burton yale pines senior vice president of the conservative 
heritage foundation who was a foreign correspondent and editor for 
time magazine during vietnam said he does not foresee a wave of 
protest 
there is no good guy romantic guy whom we ostensibly are 
beating up on a good romantic ho chi minh said pines referring 
to the nationalist figure who led communist north vietnam during 
the war saddam he said is a guy whom almost the whole world is 
against 
in seattle where throngs marched in vietnam protests a 
demonstration in front of the federal building on monday drew about 
30 peace activists in minneapolis last week about the same number 
turned out for a similar rally 
in washington a demonstration outside the pentagon attracted 
only a handful of protesters in new york and san francisco no 
demonstrations of note were reported 
tom debley a university of california spokesman said there 
was a small group that said they were going to do something the 
other day but we never saw anything materialize 
at kent state university in ohio where student protests led to 
the fatal shooting of four students by national guardsmen on may 4 
1970 spokeswoman susan rogers said the student groups arent 
meeting as they do during the academic year i believe there are 
probably student groups that will take that issue up in the fall 
while there is no wave of protest there have been ripples 
the friends committee for national legislation in washington has 
sent out a statement urging quaker activists to try to change 
this potentially dangerous policy 
defense secretary dick cheneys speech to the amvets in atlanta 
tuesday was interrupted by two young women chanting us out of 
the persian gulf they were escorted from the building 
at the oakland calif headquarters of the militant national 
pledge of resistance cocoordinator darla rucker said that 
organization which has focused on central america is educating 
itself about the middle east 
there have been small demonstrations happening she said 
my feeling is that when there is actual military action that is 
going on with us troops is when the concern level will escalate

cholesterolconscious people have long been 
saying hold the butter now a study suggests they should 
spread the margarine sparingly too 
the study found that hardened vegetable fat a primary 
ingredient of margarine and shortening raises cholesterol in the 
blood it might even be worse than saturated fat the 
longrecognized demon in the war on unhealthy eating 
experts cautioned that margarine is still a healthier choice 
than butter however the new research contradicts the widely held 
belief that the vegetable fats that margarine contains are harmless 
to the heart 
the study raises questions about trans fatty acids which make 
margarine and shortening hard so they can be used for baking 
frying and spreading about a quarter of the fat in a typical stick 
of margarine is trans fatty acids 
while such fats can occur naturally most are made when food 
companies add hydrogen to polyunsaturated and monounsaturated 
vegetable oils food labels list these as hydrogenated oils 
because these fats make up only 2 percent to 4 percent of a 
typical american diet they probably have small impact on most 
peoples cholesterol levels 
however dr scott grundy a top cholesterol expert at the 
university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas said the 
public should insist that the food industry find a way to eliminate 
trans fatty acids from margarine 
industry will say there is not enough to hurt people but this 
paper points out that this is a contributing factor he said 
it should not be ignored 
the study found that unlike saturated fat trans fatty acids 
have a doublebarreled harmful effect they increase the 
bloodstreams supply of lowdensity lipoprotein or ldl the bad 
cholesterol that contributes to fatty buildups in the arteries 
and they lower levels of highdensity lipoprotein or hdl the 
good cholesterol that protects the body from cholesterols 
harmful effects 
grundy called this a combination of detrimental effects that 
is particularly worrisome 
dr edward a emken of the us department of agriculture 
research service in peoria ill said the study should be repeated 
to check the effects of lower doses of the fat but he said the 
research has implications in terms of the us diet and it 
certainly shouldnt be taken lightly 
in a statement the international food information council an 
industry group said people should refrain from making any 
dietary changes based on the results of this one study in which 
subjects consumed extremely high levels of trans fatty acids for a 
relatively short time 
the study was conducted in the netherlands by drs ronald p 
mensink and martijn b katan of the agricultural university in 
wageningen it was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
the study was conducted on 59 men and women who were randomly 
assigned to eat three different diets for three weeks each in each 
diet 40 percent of the total calories came from fat but they 
varied in their levels of monounsaturated fats trans fatty acids 
and saturated fats 
their average cholesterol levels were 172 on the monounsaturated 
fat diet 182 on the trans fatty acid diet and 193 on the saturated 
fat diet 
however many experts believe that the ratio of total 
cholesterol to hdl is a more important sign of potential heart 
disease than is total cholesterol alone and in this regard trans 
fatty acids came off worse than saturated fat 
the lower the ratio the lower peoples risk of heart disease 
in this experiment the ratio was 313 on the monounsaturated fat 
diet 351 on trans fatty acids and 379 on saturated fats 
the dutch researchers estimated that if americans stopped eating 
all trans fatty acids and instead used monounsaturated fats such 
as olive oil they would raise their hdl levels two points and 
lower their ldl levels four points

el salvadors military high command has 
conspired to silence witnesses and destroy evidence surrounding the 
murders of six jesuit priests in 1989 charges the chairman of a 
house task force 
i believe that the high commands goal from the beginning has 
been to control the investigation and to limit the number and rank 
of the officers who will be held responsible for the crimes rep 
joe moakley dmass said in a statement wednesday 
moakleys statement followed a trip to el salvador last week by 
the staff the task force appointed earlier this year by house 
speaker thomas foley dwash to look into the murders of the 
priests their housekeeper and her daughter nov 16 at a university 
in san salvador 
little progress has been made since april when the task force 
found that the investigation had come to a virtual standstill nine 
military men including a colonel were charged in connection with 
the killings but none has come to trial 
these military people are trying to play us for saps 
moakley said in a telephone interview from his home on cape cod 
they feel we just dont remember things that its going to go 
away and be business as usual i look at all the money spent and 
all the lies over the years and its time to call a halt to it 
salvadoran military officers have withheld evidence destroyed 
evidence falsified evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in 
testimony i do not believe this could be done without at least the 
tacit consent of the high command 
despite efforts by the judge ricardo zamora and pressure from 
president alfredo cristiani and us ambassador william walker 
some individuals who may have direct knowledge of the murders 
have been shielded from serious investigation moakley said 
none of the hundreds of military personnel in the area around 
the university has volunteered any information moakley said 
log books that would show movements of military personnel in the 
area on that night have been burned and some of those questioned 
have had questionable memory lapses he said 
some potential witnesses have been transferred to posts outside 
the country he noted and an intelligence officer who told fellow 
officers of the murders the morning after they occurred later said 
he had heard the news on the radio no radio stations had been 
carrying the news at that time moakley said 
the democratic task force is pressing the bush administration 
for sharp restrictions in next years planned 85 million in us 
military aid to el salvador in all the united states is spending 
some 315 million this year on aid to el salvador much of it 
economic and food aid for an economy wracked by a decadeold civil 
war with leftist guerillas 
moakley said there still was hope for a breakthrough however 
because some military officials not involved in the murders are 
angered that the case has threatened foreign aid to the army 
pressure is growing for an end to the conspiracy of silence he 
said 
moakley added that task force staff members have interviewed 
members of the salvadoran military who are very upset with the 
situation and who do everything but actually point to the high 
command as the source of the troubles 
the government and the guerillas have embarked on united 
nationssponsored peace talks which are scheduled to resume next 
week in san jose costa rica

scientists today reported progress in 
understanding how an anticancer gene protects against lung and 
breast cancer 
in a study in the british journal nature the researchers said 
that the retinoblastoma gene guards against cancer by shutting down 
a gene involved in the stimulation of cell growth 
further studies are aimed at exactly how the retinoblastoma gene 
accomplishes that said one of the authors of the study paul 
robbins of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine 
if we can understand the way in which retinoblastoma 
functions we might be able to apply that to treatment of some of 
these forms of cancer robbins said 
the research was done at the whitehead institute in cambridge 
which robbins just left his colleagues were richard mulligan and 
jonathan horowitz who has recently moved to the duke university 
medical school in durham nc 
researchers have suspected that the retinoblastoma might act by 
shutting off one or more cellgrowth genes but they didnt know 
which ones 
failure of the retinoblastoma gene is one of several steps that 
can allow the growth of not only lung and breast cancer but also 
bladder cancer prostate cancer and a rare eye cancer called 
retinoblastoma in which the gene was first identified 
the growth gene regulated by retinoblastoma is called the fos 
gene robbins showed when the retinoblastoma gene is defective and 
cannot do its job the fos gene can help trigger the runaway cell 
growth characteristic of cancer tumors 
the fos promoter its onoff switch can normally be 
stimulated in a laboratory dish by blood serum mulligans paper 
shows that when the protein made by the retinoblastoma gene is 
thrown into the dish the stimulation is slowed 
the researchers have not yet shown precisely how the protein 
acts on the fos promoter and whether for example other proteins 
are involved 
if these results lead to further experiments that show the 
retinoblastoma protein acts directly on the fos promoter its a 
breakthrough paper said edward harlow of the cold spring harbor 
laboratory an expert on tumorsuppressor genes

commercial jetliners may be pulled off regular 
commercial routes if military aircraft and hired charters cant 
airlift troops and cargo fast enough to the middle east 
airline representatives said wednesday they have been notified 
by the pentagon that commercial flights may have to be diverted to 
accommodate the steady stream of troops and cargo 
we have been contacted by the government and made aware that 
they could during this military activity be in need of up to 
three of our boeing 747s said northwest airlines spokesman 
douglas miller 
were prepared if they need any or all of these planes to 
make them available he said 
if regularly scheduled airliners are diverted it would be the 
first use of the civil reserve air fleet since the program was 
conceived in the 1950s under the program airlines prepare and 
commit specific aircraft that can be used to carry troops or 
military cargo in times of crisis the airlines are reimbursed 
so far military used of commercial charters has not been 
extensive enough to require disruption of scheduled flights sgt 
mark jackson of the military airlift command at scott air force 
base says the reserve plan has not been put into effect so far 
but airline officials say they have been told to be ready 
us airlines have been told to be on the alert said karen 
ceremsak spokeswoman for eastern airlines in miami she said the 
airline which has flown two military charter flights since iraq 
took over kuwait has several narrowbody planes dedicated to the 
reserve fleet 
none of easterns planes in the program are large enough to fly 
troops all the way to saudi arabia she said eastern officials 
have told the military it might be able to use the planes either to 
ferry troops to other flights or to relieve planes on other 
military flights she said 
united spokesman rob doughty said the chicagobased carrier has 
62 aircraft committed to the reserve fleet primarily 747s and 
dc10s he declined to say whether any military flights had been 
made or planned 
i cannot make comment about what were doing or if we are 
doing anything doughty said citing company privacy rules that 
apply to any customer 
he said however that rumors of hundreds of pilots being called 
to active duty are untrue he said about 50 of uniteds 8000 
pilots were on active duty this week but this was not far above 
the normal for any summer week when reserve officers are required 
to attend training camps 
weve had no disruption in service he said 
doughty said the airline has arranged with the pilots union to 
continue operations if there is a wider military callup 
military officials have not disclosed how many planes or which 
airlines have been hired for the airlift which so far has been 
handled as a regular commercial business deal 
were not talking about numbers of flights or specific routes 
or airlines that are being used jackson said its still early 
enough in the operation and critical enough that were not 
divulging details of the flights

the pentagon says restrictions on information 
us journalists in saudi arabia can report are designed to protect 
soldiers families and deny military information to iraq 
one of the ground rules prevents journalists from disclosing the 
size of troop units or where they are located in the desert in the 
dispatches that are shared with the nations news media on a 
pool basis 
thats the kind of stuff the iraqis would love to know you 
might as well be giving them grid coordinates to set their 
artillery for a pentagon official said wednesday he asked to 
remain unidentified 
another restriction on the 15member pool of us journalists 
flown to saudi arabia by the pentagon over the weekend prohibits 
them from identifying individual soldiers except commandlevel 
officers by name 
that rule is in place to protect the gis families in the united 
states the pentagon official said 
you have people who dont much care for the fact that were 
there in the first place and who want to strike back at a target 
he said 
photographers are not prevented from taking pictures of anything 
they see but a group of us military escorts control where 
the pool reporters and photographers are taken each day 
a military official does a security review of the stories 
before they are dispatched to the reporters washington bureau 
then a pentagon official in washington gives it a final review 
before it is allowed to be distributed by wire services and to 
other news organizations

the government says one of every four births 
in the united states in 1988 was to an unwed mother the 1 million 
births to unmarried women was an 8 percent increase over the 
previous year 
the report wednesday by the department of health and human 
services said that while the rates for children born out of wedlock 
were highest among black women the rates have been rising faster 
for white mothers 
the statistics also showed a rise in births to young teenagers 
for the second straight year after declining through much of the 
1970s and 1980s there were 338 births per 1000 population to 
teenagers ages 15 to 17 
nearly two in three births to unwed mothers was among blacks 
since unmarried mothers are much less likely than married 
mothers to begin prenatal care early the proportion of women 
beginning such care in the first trimester showed no improvement 
through the 1980s and remains at 76 percent hhs said 
the percentage was particularly low among black and hispanic 
women

the women among the 50000 american soldiers in saudi arabia are 
likely to be a disturbing if not threatening presence in a culture 
where women cannot drive vote sit in a theater with a man or even 
show their face and hair 
the saudi kingdom has the most conservative and rigid islamic 
way of life of all the arab countries most westerners there are 
employees of western companies who are kept isolated from the rest 
of the country 
us women soldiers said wednesday that saudi men react with 
dismay and occasional hostility when they see them doing such 
noncombat jobs as repairing airplanes and driving trucks or in at 
least one case giving orders to men 
i dont think they disagree with what were doing said a 
victoria va sergeant whose name was withheld in keeping with 
the media ground rules i think theyre more like shocked 
theres an american woman shes doing what men are doing 
the us troops may pose a significant outside influence that 
may be hard to control 
its a breaking of the hermetic seal thats surrounded saudi 
arabia since it was founded in the 1920s said richard bulliet a 
professor of middle eastern studies at columbia university what 
happens to the saudi foot soldier whose world view of women is 
quasihuman when he sees a woman making an arrest 
the us buildup includes women truck drivers communications 
specialists technicians and aircraft crew chiefs the pentagon 
would not give specific numbers 
some experts warned against allowing american troops much access 
to the average saudi who lives in a culture where one recent topic 
of conversation was whether beheadings should be televised so 
far they have not been 
it would be a big mistake if our soldiers were allowed to mix 
too much said lenore martin a fellow at harvard universitys 
center for middle eastern studies 
we really have to see our forces separate because the 
stability of the government is involved one of the main reasons 
the saudis havent given us bases before is the fear of being too 
closely westernized in order to protect the fundamentalist regime 
and way of life 
though saudi men cannot drink alcohol and must adhere to a rigid 
dress code among other regulations it is saudi women who live an 
especially restricted life 
when women go outside their clothing must cover almost all of 
their bodies and faces women must use separate beaches and 
theaters they are allowed an education but can attend only 
segregated classes saudi wives cannot ask for divorces and are 
strictly limited in their right to own property 
american troops are totally incompatible with the way of life 
in saudi arabia said bulliet i have no idea whos going to 
get disgusted first the americans with saudi behavior or the 
saudis with the americans 
the virginia sergeant an f15 fighter ground crew chief said 
that saudi men stop work and stare when she tells crewmen what to 
do she said that saudi men reacted so strongly when another ground 
crew woman peeled off her shirt to work in a tshirt underneath 
that a us sergeant told her to put it back on 
they got very emotional about that the sergeant said 
they made a lot of physical movements i think they asked the 
sergeant to make her put her shirt back on 
american troops were briefed on saudi culture in one of several 
booklets distributed before shipping out 
you will seldom see women outside the home reads one it 
is considered impolite to inquire about a mans wife or his female 
children men should not show any interest in arab women do not 
photograph or stare at them arab women barely touch upon greeting 
a man and they shake hands using fingertips only 
but the saudis knowledge of the western way of life may be less 
detailed the information they glean from saudi television where 
prayers are broadcast five times daily along with readings from the 
koran is not likely to prepare them 
the fact that there are women in the us military will be 
regarded as a very unusual and perhaps disgraceful thing by the 
clergy in saudi arabia said gary sick a middle eastern 
specialist at columbia and a member of the national security 
council during the carter administration 
but he added people do what they need to do for survival it 
would be a mistake to assume that because theyre breaking their 
own rules in a crisis like this the saudis wont revert to old 
ways once the crisis is over 
indeed some experts on islamic law and culture said the role of 
women may appear more restricted than it is 
while women dont have many of privileges and liberties in 
the internal dynamics of saudi families women have to be very much 
the boss said roy muttahedah a professor at harvards center 
for middle eastern studies it leads to a lot of de facto 
matriarchies

iraqi trucks packed with goods are rolling 
overland from this red sea port toward baghdad along what is 
believed to be the only major bypass of the international naval net 
surrounding iraq 
they appear to be in a hurry to get as much iraqbound cargo 
to that destination before the sanction loophole at aqaba is 
closed said one official on condition of anonymity 
the vehicles carried distinctive yellow iraqi registration 
plates as they rolled along the desert highways wednesday toward 
baghdad 
many others with jordanian license tags loaded cargo from seven 
ships docked at aqaba the kingdoms only red sea outlet and 
headed for amman there was no way of telling how many were bound 
for the iraqi border about 370 miles northwest 
reporters were not allowed to enter aqaba port where hundreds 
of trucks crowded parking lots waiting to be loaded officials at 
the facility said the cargo came from ships and warehouses at the 
facility 
president bush has threatened to block the port of aqaba to 
iraqi trade if iraq continues getting supplies from jordan bush is 
to meet today in maine with king hussein 
the un security council ordered sanctions on iraq after 
baghdad announced the annexation of neighboring kuwait on aug 8 it 
invaded six days earlier touching off an international outcry 
thousands of us and other western and prowestern arab forces 
have since converged on saudi arabia to face off with the iraqis 
scores of warships also deployed in the oilrich persian gulf to 
intercept iraqbound products and saudi arabia and turkey halted 
iraqi oil shipments through pipelines passing across their 
territories 
jordanian and iraqi truck drivers waiting their turn for 
loading complained about the us stand 
why is america against iraqs saddam hussein when it refuses 
to do anything against israel for occupying palestine one iraqi 
driver said angrily 
more than 100 trucks rolled out of aqaba in just one hour 
wednesday morning about 10 were iraqi including tractortrailers 
refrigeration trucks that normally transport food and opendeck 
trucks carrying iron bars 
nine iraqi oil tankers were heading overland southward from 
amman and seven rolled in the opposite direction it was not known 
how many were carrying cargo and if any was for export 
port officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said there 
was nothing unusual about that they noted that iraq pumps small 
quantities of oil through a pipeline to a desert facility near 
amman tankers distribute some of the oil for use locally and the 
rest is shipped out through aqaba 
while the exact capacity of the pipeline is not known officials 
have said 50 million of oil were exported last year through that 
link to brazil 
jordan iraqs main arab ally has not committed itself to the 
embargo 
it was iraqs staunchest ally during the eightyear iraniraq 
war when convoys of trucks from aqaba ferried weapons raw 
material and foodstuffs to iraq king hussein is said to be a 
friend of president saddam 
in addition proiraqi feeling runs strong in jordan both among 
palestinians who see saddam as their hope for regaining their lost 
home in israelioccupied lands and among nationalists and islamic 
fundamentalists who resent western military intervention 
antiamerican demonstrations have flared nationwide during the 
crisis

the leftist beirut newspaper assafir 
today said that all 14 western hostages held in lebanon including 
six americans will be freed by the end of the year 
in a frontpage report the respected newspaper quoted well 
informed diplomatic sources as saying secret contacts 
involving the concerned capitals particularly tehran were under 
way to resolve the issue 
most of the captives are believed held by shiite moslem 
extremists operating under the umbrella of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god 
the report quoted the unnamed sources as saying they expect 
positive developments in the coming few days related to the fate of 
the western hostages held in lebanon 
the issue of the hostages as a result of the developments in 
the gulf region has been put on a very hot burner they said 
the hostagetakers have made various demands for the release of 
prisoners held by israel in southern lebanon and convicted 
terrorists jailed in kuwait and western capitals 
israel has refused to free hundreds of inmates held on suspicion 
of involvement in attacks against israeli troops in southern 
lebanon 
since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 there has been no 
firm word on the fate of 15 shiite prisoners whose release was 
demanded by kidnappers in return for american hostages 
most of the convicts were serving long prison terms and three 
were awaiting execution for involvement in a 1983 bombing spree 
against the us and french embassies and kuwaiti installations 
some reports said the prisoners have escaped after the iraqis 
invaded kuwait others said that they have been killed and some 
suggested that they have been moved to baghdad the iraqi capital 
assafir said the release of swiss red cross orthopedic 
technician elio erriquez on monday was part of the deal being 
worked out for an end to the issue 
it said other phases are to follow until the whole issue is 
closed by the end of this year the report added 
erriquez and a friend emanuel christen also a swiss orthopeic 
expert were kidnapped in south lebanon in october 
christen was released last week 
the conservative newspaper alanwar has reported that a ransom 
of 55 million was paid for their release but the report could 
not be independently confirmed officials in switzerland have 
denied any deal was made 
in addition to the americans the western hostages are four 
britons two west germans an italian and an irishman

aids patients are clamoring for more information 
about an unproven heat treatment following the death two weeks ago 
of an american who had gone to a mexican clinic for the therapy 
the treatment in which a patients blood is removed heated and 
put back in a continuous process was widely publicized in june 
dr kenneth alonso in atlanta who devised the treatment called 
hyperthermia had reported it eliminated signs of the aids virus in 
a man with kaposis sarcoma a deadly skin cancer common in aids 
patients 
details of alonsos findings have not yet been published in a 
scientific journal but a team from the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases went to atlanta on july 25 at his 
invitation to review his findings 
dr gabriel torres medical information consultant for the gay 
mens health crisis a patient advocacy group in new york urged 
the institute to release its report of that visit 
the majority of physicians who take care of aids patients have 
been overwhelmed by questions from the patients about 
hyperthermia he said wednesday and we dont have any 
information 
mary jane walker a spokeswoman for the institute said the 
report will be completed by the middle of next week and a statement 
will be released immediately afterward alonso said a report of his 
findings will appear shortly in the journal molecular oncology and 
tumor pharmacotherapy 
hyperthermia is used to treat some forms of cancer some doctors 
say it might turn out to be useful in the treatment of aids or 
aidsrelated cancers such as kaposis sarcoma but they say the 
treatment cannot yet be evaluated 
the report by the government team could help end the confusion 
torres said 
if the findings look promising then the next step would be to 
try to reproduce the results elsewhere he said if the findings 
arent encouraging we should not invest taxpayers dollars in 
the research he said 
in a survey of 300 aids doctors 90 percent said they had been 
asked by patients about hyperthermia torres said 
the patient who died is one of only three aids patients with 
kaposis sarcoma have received the hyperthermia treatment 
the first treated in february shows no signs of kaposis 
sarcoma or of the aids virus six months later alonso said the 
second treated in midjune has had a 50 percent regression of 
kaposis sarcoma tumors in his lungs and reduced levels of the aids 
virus alonso said they were treated in atlanta 
the third was the patient who died in mexico he was treated 
aug 1 
the patient died the next day hours later said alonso 
apparently he had a cardiac rhythm disturbance and developed 
pulmonary edema a buildup of fluid in the lungs 
alonso said the patient didnt die because of the treatment but 
because his disease was much more severe than doctors thought 
alonso said the procedure was done in mexico because his 
hospital atlanta hospital was having difficulties with georgia 
regulatory officials and because mexican doctors had invited him to 
train them in the procedure 
dr bernard bihari of new york the patients doctor was 
critical of alonsos handling of the case bihari treats aids 
patients and is executive director of the community research 
initiative an organization that conducts trials of experimental 
aids treatments 
bihari said that he had advised chemotherapy but that the 
patient sought hyperthermia against his advice after learning about 
it from news reports he said chemotherapy could probably have kept 
the patient alive for two years 
i think he died because of media hype bihari said hed 
be alive and stable now with conservative treatment 
however alonso said he had advised the patient against 
hyperthermia but that bihari had insisted that the patient receive 
it

iraqs foreign minister promised that americans 
detained in baghdad and kuwait would not be harmed he also said he 
would investigate the case of an american couple with a baby in 
need of medical care 
the minister tariq aziz made his remarks in baghdad in an 
interview with ted koppel of abcs nightline the segment aired 
wednesday 
aziz was asked why foreigners including thousands of americans 
have been detained in baghdad and kuwait since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
this measure is a temporary precautionary measure he said 
i cannot elaborate on that at the moment we might say more in 
the near future about it but i pledge that they will be safe and 
no harm will effect them 
aziz noted that 10yearold penelope nabokov of albany calif 
had been permitted to leave and he hinted at special treatment for 
other such humanitarian cases 
koppel asked if he would guarantee safe passage for an american 
couple in baghdad with a 6yearold daughter and 6monthold boy in 
need of medical care for a hernia aziz promised to ask his 
government to look into their case 
koppel did not give the couples name but peggy heath of 
farmington hills mich said they were her brother and 
sisterinlaw dawn and kevin bazner originally from northville 
mich and the bazners children elizabeth and david 
they are the only american children in that hotel heath 
said 
she said her brother is a vice president for aampw restaurants 
international and that his plane was stranded in iraq en route to 
malaysia where he and his wife live 
koppel said that he had found americans detained in a baghdad 
hotel physically well and welltreated he said they spend their 
time jogging in the halls listening to the bbc using the pool 
reading and eating 
aziz also said that iraq is ready to negotiate with the united 
states and would neither start a war with america nor invade saudi 
arabia 
the united states is blockading iraq and has sent in troops to 
protect saudi arabia since iraq invaded neighboring kuwait 
its up to the american government aziz said if they 
have come to initiate a war here i think they will be sorry for 
that because they will lose that war 
he complained that highlevel american officials imposed 
unacceptable conditions for starting talks 
they said no aziz said no dialogue with the iraqi 
government unless the iraqi government does one two three four 
this is unacceptable if they want to talk to us in a 
civilized respectable manner we are ready 
he said the invasion of kuwait was justified because the emirate 
on the persian gulf was part of iraq until 1913 when the british 
deliberately cut off this part of iraq imposed a phony regime of a 
handful of corrupt sheiks on it and created a separate entity 
the kingdom of iraq did not recognize kuwait as a separate entity 
from iraq 
asked why that action justifies an invasion more than 70 years 
later aziz replied that kuwait was conspiring with the united 
states to destabilize and impoverish iraq through oil production 
policies 
he complained that kuwait didnt respect its opec oilproduction 
quota 
they flooded the market with a glut of oil they brought down 
the prices from 18 a barrel to almost 11 a barrel and that is a 
conspiracy thats a war aziz said war can be done by arms 
war can be done by economy

thats 785 dead the official toll but we believe the rebels 
have lost at least 2000 fighters gen ranatunge said 
government officials said at least 2000 civilians died in the 
fighting since june in clashes between ethnic groups in aerial 
attacks and those caught in the crossfire 
most of the casulties occurred in the north and the east 
strongholds of the tamil rebels most of the victims were either 
tamils and moslems 
moslems who make up 7 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim neutrality in the war but tamil rebels accuse them of siding 
with the government 
on saturday tamil guerrillas massacred moslem men women and 
children in five fishing villages government officials originally 
said 173 people died but later reduced the count to 127 
on aug 3 tamil gunmen raided another eastern village and 
massacred 140 moslems in two mosques setting off a chain of 
revenge killings

a study today concludes that allergy testing in 
which specialists inject people with food extracts and watch for 
unpleasant symptoms is worthless 
people respond to dummy shots just as frequently as they do to 
extracts of chocolate potato wheat and other food the study 
found 
our study shows that this kind of testing is not valid said 
dr don l jewett it does not really tell you what people are 
bothered by 
jewett a surgeon at the university of california at san 
francisco directed the study which was performed by seven 
practitioners of environmental medicine 
the practice of injecting people with food extracts is a 
mainstay of environmental medicine doctors in this field attribute 
a wide variety of ailments to adverse reactions to foods chemicals 
and pollution 
dr sherry rogers of syracuse ny a member of the american 
academy of environmental medicine said she thought the study was 
flawed because doctors gave the wrong doses in their injections 
im flabbergasted she said its full of errors its a 
gross misunderstanding of the entire technique 
mainstream allergists test for allergic sensitivities with a 
scratch test typically they drop a bit of the suspected 
allergycausing substance on the broken skin and look for a rash 
by contrast those in environmental medicine inject the food 
into the skin and then wait to see if the patient feels ill 
possible symptoms include itching nose watering eyes plugged 
ears scratchy throat tiredness headache nausea dizziness 
difficulty breathing sleepiness depression chills coughing jaw 
tightening nervousness tension intestinal gas and aching legs 
if a substance triggers a response the doctor may then try to 
find a socalled neutralizing dose of the same food extract 
then the patient receives a series of these neutralizing shots 
jewett said his study questions the value of the treatment as 
well as the accuracy of the diagnostic test 
these are not charlatans he said the doctors think they 
have an answer and are trying their honest best unfortunately 
they are misguided 
his study published in the new england journal of medicine was 
performed on 18 patients during 20 sessions patients received 
either dummy shots of salt water or real food extracts neither 
they nor the doctors knew what was being given 
the patients felt symptoms following 27 percent of the active 
injections and 24 percent of the dummy shots 
jewett undertook the study after having the treatment himself 
and believing that it helped him i thought for sure it would 
show up that these shots worked he said it was a big shock to 
me to find that they didnt

tensions cooled at a suburban bridge blocked by 
mohawks before talks aimed at ending a dispute over what the 
indians claim is ancestral land 
in another dispute scores of ojibwa indians camped out on a 
railroad that runs through their reserve in northern ontario 
stranding hundreds of travelers railroad officials said 
provincial federal and mohawk representatives were scheduled 
today to resume negotiations that were stalled for a month they 
arranged to meet at a hotel in dorval on the west island of 
montreal 
no violence was reported wednesday night at mercier bridge in 
chateauguay a suburb south of montreal on the edge of the 
kahnawake reserve the mohawk blockade of the bridge the suburbs 
main artery to montreal had caused violent clashes in recent days 
between residents and police 
the bridge blockade was mounted by the indians five weeks ago in 
sympathy with fellow mohawks in the land dispute at oka 18 miles 
west of montreal where the indians say a planned golf course 
addition would encroach on ancestral land 
police and natives have faced each other across barricades at 
oka since july 11 when a botched police raid on a mohawk roadblock 
claimed the life of a police officer officials were unable to 
determine whose gunfire killed the man 
on wednesday jeeps armored personnel carriers and trucks 
carrying about 2600 soldiers of the 5th canadian mechanized 
brigade rolled into communities outside of montreal the troops 
moved from their base at valcartier near quebec city at the 
request of premier robert bourassa 
eight observers attached to the internation federation of human 
rights stationed themselves at oka and kahnawake 
in winnipeg there was loud applause among 300 delegates to a 
summit of native leaders when peguis chief louis stevenson said 
if there is an attack against the mohawks it would be an attack 
on all of us stevenson said if the mohawks are attacked natives 
across canada should consider retaliating by destroying power 
water and gas lines 
in longlac ontario ojibwas blocked a rail line on wednesday 
forcing via rail to halt passenger service in the region railway 
officials said 
the blockade stranded several hundred travelers overnight in 
winnipeg and white river about 120 miles north of sault ste 
marie said railway spokesman mike williams 
the railway said the natives had blocked the tracks near white 
river 
chief sidney abraham said in an interview wednesday that his 
group was never fully consulted or compensated for construction of 
the railway or the highway both of which cut through the long lake 
reserve 
in separate action members of another ojibwa group near longlac 
have been blocking rail lines since monday they set up lawn chairs 
and tents to block two rail lines with up to 150 people camping 
out at the blockade at a time 
the reasons for the blockade were not immediately clear 
we wont operate any trains until the blockades are completely 
gone williams said wednesday night adding the company has 
halted passenger service between toronto and winnipeg 
about 187 passengers on a westbound train from toronto to 
winnipeg were spending the night in white river because of the 
blockade via spokesman paul raynor said 
those passengers were spending the night aboard their train 
which is equipped with sleeper cars he said they were to be bused 
to thunder bay 180 miles to the south and flown to winnipeg

firefighters have nearly 
contained the blazes that closed yosemite park for the first time 
in its 100year history and its most popular section could be open 
by monday officials say 
the firest have burned about 34 square miles of the park over 
the past week 
overall in california about 1300 wildfires have burned more 
than 400 square miles since aug 3 hundreds of forest and range 
fires also burned in alaska arizona idaho wyoming montana 
oregon and washington state 
three big fires that closed the park to visitors aug 9 should 
be contained by friday night officials said they said a highway 
through the park will reopen friday but the popular yosemite 
valley wont open until after the weekend 
the reason for the closure until monday is we have fires 
burning snags and falling rocks said janet buzzini a 
spokeswoman for the us forest service 
in yosemite the largest fire has burned 17000 acres on the 
parks western border it was about 80 percent contained and was 
expected to be fully contained by friday said dwayne collier of 
the state forestry department 
a second fire across the merced river that has burned 4400 
acres was 60 percent contained today and should be fully contained 
this evening he said the third fire was contained at 4700 acres 
on wednesday collier said 
other small fires also burned in the 757000acre park but 
there were no fires on the valley floor where tourists congregate 
in foresta a vacation village near yosemite fire destroyed 66 
homes earlier this week 
for the third day in a row fire officials gave highest priority 
to a fire in northern californias tehama county that burned nearly 
22000 acres and was 70 percent contained the fire earlier this 
week threatened some 1600 homes 
as in yellowstone national park where fires swept through 
nearly half of its 22 million acres in the virtually rainfree 
summer of 1988 yosemite has a policy of letting lightningstruck 
fires burn in some areas 
but the fires this summer are in areas where blazes are fought 
automatically because of their proximity to roads or buildings 
said sue fritzke a yosemite fire official 
officials at both parks blamed the intensity of the fires on 100 
years of unenlightened management by not allowing small fires to 
sweep out dead wood and underbrush managers set the stage for 
huge destructive fires they said 
that practice changed in the early 1970s but there is still a 
buildup of downed wood and underbrush left over from earlier days 
officials said

by letting a community college train air 
traffic controllers the federal aviation administration reckons it 
wont have to play the bad guy quite so often 
the agency said wednesday it has agreed to hire 14 graduates a 
year from beaver county community college it will be the first 
school apart from the faas academy in oklahoma city to train 
controllers for the nations airports 
about 1200 candidates each year take rigorous threemonth 
courses at the faa academy and half of them fail and lose their 
government jobs said herbert mclure faa human resources director 
the program at the college in monaca about 30 miles from 
pittsburgh will allow unsuccessful candidates to change their 
fields of study without the stigma of failure mclure said 
wed like to have a more humane way of terminating people 
he said our business is in air traffic control were not 
professionals in the training field 
the project could save the government 45000 per controller 
faa officials said each controller trained by the faa academy is 
on the government payroll during training and the agency also 
picks up their housing and transportation costs 
at the community college the students pay 
the system we have now pits the employer against the 
employee william pollard faa associate administrator for air 
traffic the first words we tell them should not be fifty 
percent of you are not going to make it as they are now 
the school already operates the tower at the beaver county 
airport the only tower in the nation run by a college faa 
officials said 
graduates now can be placed at mediumsized airports such as 
those in erie youngstown ohio or des moines iowa then must 
pass the faas onthejob tests before they are certified 
the starting salary for an air traffic controller is 23000 
the faa has struggled to fill controllers posts since 1981 
when president reagan fired 11000 union controllers who illegally 
walked off the job 
the faa academy is not attracting the right types of 
individuals at this point said tony dresden a spokesman for the 
national air traffic controllers association in washington after 
the 1981 strike they threw an enormous net out to fill those 
posts 
if the beaver county program works other us colleges could 
offer faaapproved courses in air traffic control mclure said

lithuania and the soviet unions largest republic 
have signed a trade and economic cooperation treaty that bypasses 
the central government the official tass news agency reported 
today 
the treaty signed wednesday between lithuania and the russian 
republic is the first of its kind between two soviet republics it 
is the result of russian president boris n yeltsins offer last 
month to negotiate a range of political economic and social 
treaties with other republics 
the treaty was signed in the lithuanian capital of vilnius by 
the republics prime minister kazimiera prunskiene and russian 
prime minister ivan silayev tass said 
the independent news agency postfactum said prices of goods to 
be traded between the two republics will initially be negotiated by 
the buyers and sellers but will gradually move to world prices 
under the soviet unions command economy all resources and 
products now are simply handed over to the central government at 
prices set by soviet bureaucrats they then redistribute everything 
around the country 
tass said issues standing in the way of even closer economic 
cooperation between lithuania and russia include the legal question 
of who owns natural resources in the huge russian territory 
lithuania wants to import natural resources and raw materials 
for its industries including oil and natural gas the central 
government cut off oil and gas supplies and imposed an economic 
blockade against lithuania after its march 11 independence 
declarations 
the sanctions were not lifted until after lithuania said june 29 
that it would freeze its declaration in return for a resumption of 
energy and other supplies and the start of sovereignty negotiations 
with the kremlin 
russia has claimed ownership of its natural resources now 
controlled by the kremlin and yeltsin last week declared invalid 
any contracts to sell russian resources without the republics 
permission

i just couldnt look at myself in the mirror and walk away 
the 37yearold vietnam veteran said wednesday 
that doesnt mean hes unafraid youve got to be a fool not 
to be scared everyone is a little scared outler said 
his understanding of fear is part of the reason outler felt he 
had to go he said he wanted to share his combat experience with 
younger soldiers in his unit 
the biggest thing you can tell them is just rely on that 
expert training theyve received he said its back there in 
their heads

iraq today said it will free 1000 iranian 
prisoners a day under an initiative aimed at ending conflict with 
iran to focus on the confrontation with the us forces deployed in 
the persian gulf 
an air force spokesman meanwhile warned iraq cannot 
guarantee the safety of any foreign pilot who might be shot down 
over iraqi territory he said such guarantees were impossible 
because of the rage the iraqi people and the arabs harbor for the 
aggressive foreign intervention 
the warning was broadcast by baghdad radio which did not name 
the spokesman 
the official iraqi news agency quoted a presidential spokesman 
as saying iraq had decided to repatriate 2000 iranian prisoners a 
day as of friday 
but the red cross said it did not have the facilities to absorb 
such a large number of pows and that it is ready to handle 1000 
prisoners daily the agency quoted the spokesman as saying 
it said arrangements were under way so the number may be 
increased at a later stage 
the agency said those held longest will be the first to be 
released friday at the border posts of kasreshirin and khanaqin 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus said preparations to receive the freed inmates have been 
completed 
the international committee of the red cross said today it has 
begun interviewing iranian prisoners asking them if they wanted to 
be repatriated martine haemmerli spokeswoman for the swissbased 
organization speaking in geneva quoted iranian authorities as 
saying they are prepared to accept the prisoners at the border 
she said there has been no word yet from the iranians as to when 
the first large group of iraqi pows would be repatriated 
the red cross has registered some 50000 pows held by iran and 
19000 by iraq but un officials and diplomats in tehran and 
baghdad maintain that the total number of pows captured in the 
198088 war is more than 100000 
in his peace offer wednesday iraqi president saddam hussein 
also said that he would begin withdrawing troops friday from 
iranian territories occupied in the final weeks of the iraniraq 
war halted by a un ceasefire on aug 20 1988 
iran has been pressing for a complete exchange of prisoners 
albeit on its own terms since the unsponsored truce took effect 
it welcomed saddams offer and is expected to agree to free 
iraqi prisoners 
in a letter to iranian president hashemi rafsanjani text of 
which was broadcast by the official media wednesday saddam said he 
accepted a 1975 border demarcation treaty as a basis for resolving 
the border dispute 
saddams abrogation of the treaty was one of the reasons that 
pushed the two countries into war in september 1980 
his refusal to reinstate that accord which gave iraq and iran 
equal share of the strategic shattalarab waterway was a major 
obstacle in unsponsored peace talks launched after the 
ceasefire 
saddam had insisited on full iraqi sovereignty over 
shattalarab a major iraqi outlet to the gulf 
saddams message wednesday did not specify the area from which 
his troops will withdraw tehran claims iraq still holds 770 square 
miles of its land the united nations says the size of the occupied 
area is half of that 
with the exception of jordan all the countries neighboring iraq 
have closed their borders due to un sanctions imposed on iraq 
after its aug2 invasion of iraq 
a peace treaty with iran whose 630mile border is iraqs 
longest would remove the threat of warfare on that front 
it also would allow saddam to throw the manpower now used along 
the border with iran into the confrontation with the forces 
assembled in saudi arabia

freedom is closer than ever today for 
tens of thousands of soldiers some only boys who were taken 
prisoner in the 198088 iraniraq war and they have another 
persian gulf conflict to thank for it 
some have languished in prisonerofwar camps since the early 
days of the iraniraq war that broke out in september 1980 even 
though the fighting stopped two years ago 
iraqi president saddam hussein embroiled in a military 
confrontation with the united states over his aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait declared wednesday he will release all iranian captives 
iraq today said it will free 1000 iranian prisoners a day 
starting friday the official iraqi news agency said iraq had 
wanted to repatriate 2000 iranian prisoners a day but the red 
cross did not have the facilities to absorb such a large number of 
pows 
the swissbased international committee of the red cross said 
today it has begun processing prisoners for the release and that 
iran said it was ready to accept them at the border 
the number of releases would be the largest since a ceasefire 
halted the fighting on aug 20 1988 
the pow situation cannot be overestimated politically said 
philip robbins an analyst at londons royal institute for 
international affairs and a mideast specialist 
getting these men back will have a big impact in iraq 
particularly among the families who have been pressing for the 
return of their people it will certainly boost saddams position 
internally 
saddams move was part of a package of iraqi concessions that 
dramatically enhanced the prospect of a peace treaty nearly two 
years after the ceasefire 
saddam was apparently seeking to secure his long eastern border 
with iran while he faces the americans and their allies mustering 
in saudi arabia 
iran has been pressing for a complete exchange of prisoners 
albeit on its own terms since the unsponsored truce took effect 
it is now expected to agree to free iraqi prisoners however 
red cross spokeswoman martine haemmerli said the humanitarian 
organizations geneva headquarters was still waiting late wednesday 
for word from tehran 
the red cross which will oversee the exchange has registered 
about 50000 pows held by iran and more than 19000 by iraq 
but it says it has not been allowed access to all prisoners 
un officials and diplomats in iran and iraq have long maintained 
that the total number of prisoners is more than 100000 60000 to 
70000 in iran and 30000 to 50000 in iraq 
if those figures are correct the exchange will be the biggest 
organized by the red cross since the geneva convention of 1949 
since the ceasefire the pows on both sides have been 
bargaining chips in the peace talks that deadlocked almost as soon 
as they began 
the un security councils ceasefire resolution stipulated 
that all pows be freed 
but iran refused to free its captives until iraq withdrew from 
iranian territory captured in the final months of the war 
iraq refused to pull back until iran acknowledged iraqs 
sovereignty over the shattalarab waterway the confluence of the 
euphrates and tigris rivers that forms the southern boundary 
between the two countries 
but in a letter to iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
broadcast wednesday by the official baghdad radio saddam said he 
will relinquish occupied territory and abide by a 1975 treaty 
splitting control of the shattalarab he had long said that 
treaty was invalid 
any prisoner exchange however is likely to be prolonged by 
prisoners who resist repatriation 
both sides have accused the other of torturing and brainwashing 
pows 
in addition they have said thousands of pows defected often 
soldiers who surrendered and feared retribution if they returned 
home 
a un report in late 1988 said many iranian and iraqi prisoners 
fear persecution if they go back and that iraqi pows could riot if 
attempts were made to repatriate them 
the problem over prisoners who do not want to be repatriated 
will likely complicate and prolong the expected exchange operation 
the situation is similar to problems encountered in arranging 
the voluntary return of prisoners that prolonged the korean war for 
more than a year until april 1953 
the soviet union held thousands of germans after world war ii 
ended the last 9000 were not released until 1955 after moscow and 
bonn agreed to restore diplomatic relations

thierse said 
he told west berlins radio station sfb he expects the decision 
as soon as the partys members of parliament return from vacation 
party officials have threatened to leave de maizieres 
government several times in recent weeks 
de maiziere whose conservative christian democrats dominate the 
coalition has come under severe criticism for allegedly dealing 
behind the backs of the social democrats in an attempt to speed up 
unification 
the prime minister also is facing a national economic 
catastrophe 
east germanys deepening economic crisis forced de maiziere into 
ousting the four ministers from his quarrelsome cabinet 
de maiziere announced the dismissals of finance minister walter 
romberg and agriculture minister peter pollack at a hastily called 
news conference on wednesday evening also gone are economics 
minister gerhard pohl and justice minister kurt wuensche 
romberg a social democrat said members his party planned to 
meet today and discuss their future in the coalition 
pohl is a christian democrat while the other two are not 
aligned with a party 
in announcing the changes wednesday de maiziere cited 
unspecified errors in negotiating the treaty that governs the 
economic merger of the two german states he also said distribution 
of funds from west germany to restructure the east german economy 
was proceeding too slowly 
wuensche had held legal posts under the former communist 
government and his ouster had been demanded for months by some 
political groups de maiziere gave no reason for wuensches 
resignation but said it was not related to the removal of the other 
three ministers 
the rapid shift from a centrally planned to a free market system 
has released shock waves throughout the east german economy the 
two germanys merged their economies and east germany introduced the 
west german mark as its currency on july 1 a major step in the 
unification process 
pollacks ouster was announced just hours after angry farmers 
pelted him with eggs at a mass rally in downtown east berlin 
nationwide up to 700000 farmers took part in twohour strikes 
wednesday the east german news agency adn said 
the farmers protest was the biggest show of anger yet in a 
sector reeling from the effects of east germanys economic slide as 
it moves to a free market after four decades of socialism 
de maiziere said pollacks dismissal was not related to the 
nationwide farm protests however he said pollack had failed to 
design a program to restructure the agriculture system 
the cabinet posts will not be filled but will be handled by 
lowerranking government officials until unification with west 
germany de maiziere said that is expected to occur later this 
year 
experts say up to 4 million of east germanys 88 million 
workers could lose their jobs as the nation continues its move 
toward a market economy 
almost 1 million workers now are either jobless or working 
shorter hours at lower pay under a west germanfinanced program to 
keep workers targeted for layoff on the job

thousands of foreigners including two 
americans three britons and a frenchman today fled iraq and 
crossed into jordan a senior jordanian official reported 
the six were the first westerners to cross into jordan since 
saturday when baghdad was reported to have banned westerners from 
leaving there are fears that iraq would not permit the foreigners 
to leave until the persian gulf crisis is resolved 
the official who cannot be named under standing regulations 
would not give the names of the western evacuees he said they were 
among 4700 people mainly egyptians who crossed through the 
ruweishid border post 200 miles northeast of amman by noon 5 
am edt 
a us embassy spokesman said the mission was aware of the 
jordanian officials statement but did not know anything about the 
two americans who reportedly crossed the border 
these are private citizens and if they do not contact us we 
have no way of finding out anything about them the spokesman 
jonathan owens said 
the british embassy also said it had no information about the 
britons 
meanwhile about 100 demonstrators marched four miles across 
amman to deliver a protest to the us embassy 
they chanted proiraqi and antiamerican slogans outside the 
embassy as a fiveman delegation delivered the protest addressed to 
president bush 
it called for the immediate withdrawal of american troops from 
the region to give the arab nation a chance to solve its disputes 
by dialogue and peaceful means 
the protest warned arab reaction will be strong and 
destructive for your interests in the region and the future 
arabamerican relationship if you attack iraq

police around the embassy did not intervene 
the demonstration developed a few hours before king hussein of 
jordan was due to meet with bush in maine to discuss a peaceful 
settlement of the gulf crisis 
jordan iraqs main arab ally has still not committed itself to 
unmandated sanctions imposed on iraq after its aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
bush said this week that he might send warships to jordans red 
sea port at aqaba to enforce the embargo on iraqbound cargo us 
troops are in saudi arabia as part of a multinational force to 
deter a possible iraqi attack on the desert kingdom

a west german museum said today it soon 
expects to recover 362 valuable drawings and watercolors taken 
during world war ii including works by duerer rubens and van gogh 
the works were taken to the soviet union after the war one of 
numerous cases of treasures plundered or spirited away from the 
defeated nation 
ursula lichtlein a spokeswoman for the kunsthalle bremen 
museum said officials there expect the 362 art works will be 
returned next month or in october 
she cautioned that negotiations are still under way with 
moscow including questions of whether any payment will be involved 
we have organized an exhibition for next year so that we can 
show the returned works to the public ms lichtlein said by 
telephone from the northern port city of bremen 
the way the bremen drawings and watercolors reached the soviet 
union sounds almost like the plot from a suspense novel 
in 1945 as the red army advanced on germany a soviet soldier 
stumbled across the stunning collection of drawings and watercolors 
stashed in a castle for safekeeping 
the soldier an architect in an engineering corps bundled what 
he could off to moscow where he stored them in a museum there 
they sat covered and concealed from the world 
now the aging soldier says the pieces should go back to the 
kunsthalle bremen their true owner 
kunsthalle bremen director siegfried salzmann says about 4000 
items went to a castle northwest of berlin to prevent damage by 
air attacks soviet troops occupied the area in april 1945 
the soviet soldier viktor baldin asked his superiors what was 
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest he packed 
off what he could to moscow salzmann said 
some of the museums wartime treasures were returned after 1945 
but many others are still missing salzmann said 
the soldier now in his 70s contacted the bremen museum last 
year and told them for the first time that some of what they had 
given up for lost was secure in moscow 
we supposed they could be in the soviet union but we didnt 
know salzmann said in an earlier associated press interview he 
was on a business trip today and could not be reached for comment 
the museum has invited baldin to bremen in september to help 
write a reminiscence for the museums catalog other artists 
represented included rembrandt degas manet van dyck and goya 
bremens art treasures are stored for now in a museum in moscow 
during world war ii museums libraries and churches packed up 
their most valuable works and shipped them off for safekeeping 
often to the eastern reaches of germany away from allied bombers 
in a texas court an east german church financed by west germany 
is fighting the heirs of a us soldier who the church claims made 
off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine 
us forces occupied the quedlinburg area in what is now east 
germany in 1945 
the treasures include a silver ivory and gold reliquary from 
the 9th or 10th century a 10th century byzantine rockcrystal 
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones

iraqi planes have turned and flown away 
several times after weapons systems radar aboard us jets have 
locked onto the iraqi targets several air force crew chiefs said 
today 
although the us airmen declined to go into detail there was 
no indication that any of the encounters involved iraqi planes 
attempting to intrude into saudi arabian air space 
they dont want to play with us one crew chief said if i 
were in a mirage and an f15 locked onto me id get out of there 
fast too 
col john mcbroom commander of the 1st tactical fighter wing 
from langley air force base in virginia refused to confirm the 
reports and said he had instructed his pilots not to discuss any 
encounters with iraqi jets 
im not going to get into our encounters he said but he 
did say he considered the us air power here far superior to 
iraqs were not over here to go to war but we will finish one 
quickly in the air 
another officer in the unit and several crew chiefs said weapons 
systems aboard us f15s have locked onto iraqi jets several times 
during flight missions near the kuwaitsaudi border 
one of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the 
radar locks on one crew chief said 
theres been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock 
on theyre gone said another 
when asked again later about the encounters reported by crew 
chiefs mcbroom said all ill do is remind you our radar can 
lock on at a pretty good range beyond that youll have to ask the 
iraqis 
he seemed to be suggesting that the episodes recounted by his 
men involved iraqi planes flying well within kuwaiti airspace 
mcbroom said the fighter unit felt somewhat vulnerable on the 
ground when his unit first arrived last week but now have 
coordinated missions with the saudis and received powerful ground 
protection from other us forces including the massive patriot 
groundtoair missile systems 
the reporters visited with the fighter wing this morning at a 
saudi air base where it has set up camp using spare saudi hangers 
maintenance garages and other facilities 
ground rules for the pentagon pool operation prohibit the 
release of the exact location or the exact number of planes and 
other weapons systems or the publication of the names of 
noncommand officers 
the troops are living in saudi barracks and schools now but a 
tent city is under construction on the base as is a portable 
hospital that already is treating about 15 cases of heat stress a 
day according to air force officials interviewed today 
mcbroom said the saudi base facilities are the best he has ever 
seen the saudis build everything big and everything right he 
said 
mcbroom and his crew chiefs and maintenance personnel said they 
have had very few equipment problems associated with the heat most 
of the planes are being kept outdoors in the heat because 
electronic systems sometimes have temporary troubles when going 
from a cool to hot environment mcbroom said 
the air force has extensive stocks of missiles for the jets and 
crews were seen unloading boxes of 20mm shells for their onboard 
guns as well

under unwritten common law dating back to the 
middle ages a person cannot be prosecuted for murder in georgia if 
the victim takes more than a year and a day to die 
under the law sala shavon cross who was shaken into a coma at 
3 months and died 18 months later took too long to die murder 
charges against her father david lebron cross were thrown out 
earlier this month 
the case renewed scrutiny of the year and a day rule and an 
appeal to be filed with the georgia supreme court this month 
provides the state with its best opportunity in nearly a decade to 
repeal it 
the rule based upon the precedents of english common law and 
dating to the 13th century does not exist in georgias official 
code but snakes through its judicial decisions and has become 
complicated by modern medicine 
a prosecutor in the case said the rule leaves wouldbe murder 
cases hanging in a limbo created by advances in medical technology 
the moral of this rule is if you hurt somebody make sure you 
hurt them near a hospital so they can stay on life support for a 
year and a day then go on about your business said cobb county 
assistant district attorney bruce hornbuckle thats the 
nightmare scenario 
a cobb county judge threw out murder charges against cross after 
his attorney successfully cited the rule 
bert cohen crosss lawyer said the rule keeps a person from 
having the threat of a murder charge follow him through the rest of 
his life 
how long should somebody have something like this hanging over 
his head asked cohen we value individual rights in this 
country and its pretty cruel to have something like this 
indefinitely hanging over someones head 
cross still faces a child cruelty charge and if convicted 
would face up to 20 years in jail on the murder charge 
prosecutors had said they would seek a life sentence 
over the past decade many states have moved to purge the rule 
through legislation the courts or a combination of the two said 
deborah young assistant professor of law at emory university 
some of the reasons for the law have clearly passed their time 
in history she said 
at least two other states nevada and maryland still have 
year and a day rules in nevada its a state law and in 
maryland it is a matter of common law two states california and 
washington have rules stipulating three years and a day 
cross 27 was arrested on charges of aggravated battery and 
cruelty to children in august 1987 one week after he carried his 
unconscious daughter to the hospital he said the baby had choked 
on her formula 
medical tests showed evidence of 11 old and new fractures to 
salas ribs arms and legs doctors said the infant had suffered 
irreversible brain damage and would not regain consciousness 
cross was jailed but was released on bond four months later as 
the child clung to life he declined to give his consent when the 
hospital and salas mother linda lawson asked a judge to allow 
doctors to withhold lifesaving efforts if sala stopped breathing on 
her own 
fulton superior court judge don a langham denied the request 
for continued resuscitation in december 1988 and sala died two 
months later 
cross was indicted in october 1989 on charges of murder and 
cruelty to children cobb county superior court judge watson white 
dismissed the murder charge aug 2 saying the year and a day 
rule was the law in georgia

city officials are investigating allegations 
that guards at rikers island jail lined up and clubbed inmates in 
retaliation for a threehour melee 
robert kasanof chairman of the board of correction said 
wednesday he had compiled significant evidence that guards beat 
inmates at random several hours after tuesday nights uprising 
i asked susan shepard the commissioner of investigation to 
conduct an investigation of the systematic nightstick clubbing of 
prisoners after the institutions were fully secure what is known 
as a payback kasanof said 
the inmates apparently were angry because guards had blockaded 
the jail for two days the guards were protesting prison violence 
and what they called overly lenient treatment of inmates 
the blockade had kept prisoners from having visitors disrupted 
meal schedules kept thousands of workers from going home and left 
the prison short of guards officials said 
emergency medical services spokeswoman lynn schulman said 162 
people were treated for injuries that included stab wounds broken 
bones cuts and bruises and back injuries one inmate who allegedly 
stabbed two guards was in critical condition at elmhurst general 
hospital corrections officials said 
michael letwin president of the association of legal aid 
attorneys which specializes in prisoner rights cases alleged that 
guards took aside inmates who had not been involved in the 
disturbance and beat their heads against the wall 
the walls were covered with the inmates blood he said 
phil seelig president of the correction officers benevolent 
association countered that guards had acted in selfdefense after 
inmates hurled pipes sinks and other debris at them 
the officers won the fight and thats what theyre supposed to 
do he said 
mayor david dinkins ordered city correction commissioner allyn 
sielaff to investigate allegations that inmates were clubbed 
about 800 inmates went on a rampage as city officials negotiated 
an end to the blockade which was prompted by the aug 7 robbery 
and beating of a guard by inmates 
guards rushed back from the picket line to help put down the 
riot at the otis bantum center which holds 1450 of the islands 
total of 14000 inmates 
the riot ended after guards used tear gas on three of the 14 
dormitories where inmates had set up blockades the other 11 
surrendered

donald woods a former 
newspaper editor who escaped from south africa in 1977 after being 
banned for challenging a police account of activist steve bikos 
death returned from exile today 
i was determined i would never come back here unless i could 
do so freely said woods whose flight across the border was 
depicted in the richard attenborough film cry freedom 
woods return to a battery of cameras at jan smuts airport was a 
stark contrast to his escape in disguise late on new years eve 12 
years ago 
i feel terrific what a nice welcome woods told 
journalists a former colleague thrust todays edition of the east 
london daily dispatch into woods hands as he walked into the 
arrivals hall 
woods was the editor of the daily dispatch when he and his 
family fled south africa two months before his escape the 
government had served him with a banning order which prevented him 
from working as a journalist 
woods was placed under partial house arrest and other 
restrictions affecting his freedom of movement association or 
expression he could not be quoted orally or in writing 
woods was banned after he publicly challenged the police version 
of the death in detention of his close friend biko the leader of 
a group called black consciousness 
biko 30 died in police custody on sept 12 1977 at the 
inquest into his death a magistrate ruled that bikos fatal head 
injuries were probably received during questioning but that no 
policeman was to blame 
woods book biko published soon after he went into exile 
in london was used as the basis for cry freedom 
id still like to know what happened to steve biko woods 
said i dont think the circumstances not only of steve bikos 
death but also his life will ever be forgotten 
woods said he is in south africa for a sixweek journey of 
rediscovery to see friends and family to work on a book and a 
television documentary and to write newspaper articles 
when woods left the country in 1977 south africas black 
townships were in turmoil only days before his return they 
erupted again but woods described the current violence as the 
problems of recovery rather than the problems of decline 
which he said caused the 1970s unrest 
i have always felt confident about south africas future in 
the longterm because of the wealth of all the people he said 
with the caliber of the people allied with the natural wealth it 
would take quite a lot of bad planning for things to go wrong in 
the longterm

karachay lake a 100acre body of water in the 
soviet union could be the most polluted spot on the planet 
the result of years of radioactive waste dumping according to a 
published report today 
us experts who recently visited a soviet nuclear weapons 
production complex found extremely high levels of radioactive 
contamination and a history of high doses to production workers 
the new york times reported 
the soviets have confirmed that in 1951 atomic bomb makers 
began pumping radioactive wastes into karachay lake about 900 
miles east of moscow a practice that continued until the 
accumulation reached 120 million curies 
that amount is about 2 times greater than the release from the 
chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 
this has got to be the must polluted spot on the planet 
said thomas b cochran a physicist and senior staff scientist at 
the natural resources defense council a private environmental 
group in washington 
the dose rate on the lake shore near the outlet pipe is 600 
roentgen per hour according to a new report by cochran and robert 
standish norris also at the council 
at that rate one hours exposure would kill a person within 
weeks the times reported 
the times said soviet documents describe a sanitary alienation 
zone in contaminated areas in which people are forbidden to live 
or travel the zones size was unknown 
provided you keep away from it which they are it is causing 
no harm to public health said richard wilson a harvard 
university physicist who has studied the soviet nuclear complex 
i would characterize it as greater than anything weve even 
contemplated in this country 
recent soviet disclosures also show very high worker exposures 
the newspaper said 
other scientists who have visited the area recently say the lake

six said frank l parker an engineering professor at vanderbilt 
university and chairman of the national academy of sciences board 
on radioactive waste management he was at the chelyabinsk site in

a leading former judge came under fire today for 
reportedly disputing the innocence of irish people cleared by the 
courts and suggesting british sovereignty was under threat from 
a german jew 
lord denning later insisted his remarks to the weekly spectator 
magazine were reported in a very misleading and erroneous way 
the interviewer novelist an wilson wrote that denning 
cleared the remarks about the irish for publication he did not say 
whether denning cleared the remark about jews but denning said 
later that is just the sort of thing i would hate having put in 
a paper at all 
denning 91 was master of the rolls the highest civil judge in 
england when he retired in 1982 an internationally renowned legal 
authority he remains an influential voice on british judicial 
issues 
in the interview published in questionandanswer form denning 
attacked the growing power of the european community to influence 
british internal affairs 
he singled out ec official sir leon brittan a lawyer and former 
cabinet minister who is now on the commission that governs the 
12nation european community 
according to the spectator denning said of brittan that he 
was no good as a lawyer and added a german jew isnt he 
wilson whats that got to do with it 
denning look him up i think youll find hes a german jew 
telling us what to do with our english law its quite plain that 
these paneuropeans do not go by the words of the ec treaty 
brittan is the londonborn son of lithuanian jewish immigrants 
he was on vacation and unavailable for comment his office said 
hayim pinner secretary general of the board of deputies of 
british jews denounced dennings quite disgraceful and 
gratuitous and as it happens inaccurate remark 
wilson quoted denning as decrying the public campaigns that have 
quashed or undermined the convictions of alleged irish terrorists 
the death penalty abolished in 1965 should have been retained 
for murder most foul denning said we shouldnt have all 
these campaigns to get the birmingham six released if theyd been 
hanged theyd have been forgotten and the whole community would 
be satisfied 
the birmingham six are irishmen serving life sentences for 
terrorist bombings in 1974 that killed 19 people their supporters 
say they were convicted on bad forensic evidence and confessions 
extracted under duress 
denning also questioned the innocence of the socalled guildford 
four who were jailed for life in 1975 for bombings that claimed 
five lives they were freed last year after an appeals court 
quashed their convictions 
wilson asked denning if they had hanged the guildford four 
they would have hanged the wrong men wouldnt they 
denning replied no theyd probably have hanged the right 
men 
later he told bbctv their convictions were quashed but 
that does not mean they were innocent it only means their 
convictions were not safe thats all 
on bbc radio he said im very annoyed at the spectator 
magazine which has misinterpreted me altogether which has misled 
the public and has attributed to me defamatory things which i 
never said and would never entertain 
breda power daughter of one of the birmingham six said i 
dont take what denning has said seriously he is obviously getting 
very old and does not know what he is talking about 
anita richards a campaigner for the birmingham six said we 
are outraged at lord dennings hysteria

the spacecraft magellan was ordered to 
bounce radar off venus today for the first time to test its 
picturemaking ability which wont be harmed by glitches with a 
computer and radio transmitter nasa says 
the test scheduled for late afternoon was expected to produce 
a postage stampsized picture of a 15by15mile area of venus 
surface although the picture wont be processed until the weekend 
tony spear magellan project manager at the agencys jet propulsion 
laboratory said wednesday 
spear said earlier the picture wouldnt be released unless it 
revealed an interesting discovery 
magellans formal program to make detailed maps and pictures of 
venus starts aug 29 or sept 1 the national aeronautics and space 
administration plans to release the first images during september 
venus the second planet from the sun is covered by thick 
clouds so radar must be used to make images of its surface 
the radar was turned on for an hour wednesday just to show it 
was working for the first time since magellan went into orbit 
around venus last friday after a 948millionmile trip from earth 
the radar previously was turned on for tests during may and 
december while magellan cruised toward venus 
spear said magellans minor troubles wont harm its 744 million 
mission 
just like everything in life this spacecraft has little 
idiosyncrasies and little warts and were experiencing some of 
those they are minor and we can work around them but they do take 
some time he said 
one minor problem developed tuesday when the backup to 
magellans main radio transmitter shut off when it wasnt supposed 
to do so 
we just turned it back on again spear said 
similar unwanted shutdowns plagued the main transmitter during 
magellans journey to venus so the backup has been acting as the 
spacecrafts main transmitter 
the other glitch which nasa revealed sunday involves a failed 
computer chip that caused commands to be rejected by a backup 
computer that helps aim magellan engineers plan to bypass the 
faulty chip as they did after another chip failed last dec 31 
spear said that problem may take two weeks to two months to fix 
magellan was launched from the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989

president mikhail s gorbachev is interrupting his 
summer vacation in the crimea and returning to moscow to work on 
his program for restructuring the soviet economy tass reported 
today 
the soviet news agency quoted russian president boris n 
yeltsin who broke off his tour of the vast russian republic on 
wednesday for similar reasons 
tass said gorbachev is expected to return to moscow within the 
next days gorbachev began his vacation in early august and had 
been expected to be away from the capital for a month 
gorbachev and yeltsin agreed earier this month to draft a joint 
program for moving toward a market economy based on the 500 
days program developed by economists in the russian republic 
the two leaders appointed a 12member group to work out the 
details including gorbachevs top economic adviser nikolai y 
petrakov a strong proponent of market refomrs deputy prime 
minister leonid a abalkin presidential council member stanislav 
shatalin and officials of the russian republic the nations 
largest 
yeltsin met today with the working group and told reporters it 
was having trouble getting information from the soviet finance and 
defense ministries and could not even obtain a copy of the current 
soviet budget 
he blamed the obstacles on either a lack of desire or 
sabotage the news service interfax reported 
yeltsin said the joint economic program was scheduled to be 
implemented oct 1 and in its initial phase would be designed to 
stabilize the economy 
by jan 1 steps will have been taken to correct problems in 
money circulation and strengthen the ruble a noncovertible 
currency and to halt the drop in its buying power he said 
yeltsin said his republic would implement the program earlier 
than the central government if agreement could not be reached on 
the final joint draft 
he said soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov was working on a 
parallel program 
yeltsin was elected president of the huge russian federation 
with threequarters of the soviet land mass and half its people in 
june he quit the communist party in july starting an exodus of 
leading reformers

a 12yearold leukemia victim battling for life 
has won a narrow legal skirmish in his attempt to force twin 
halfsiblings to be tested as potential bone marrow donors but the 
victory has been postponed 
circuit judge monica reynolds denied a motion wednesday to 
postpone appointing guardians for the twins and for jeanpierre 
bosze who doctors say needs a transplant to stand any chance of 
survival 
but the state supreme court later stayed the guardians two 
chicago lawyers from taking any action until it could reconsider 
its original ruling calling for their appointment the court gave 
no indication when it would reconsider the ruling 
the boy needs a donation from someone whose tissue type closely 
matches his donor bone marrow to replace his own diseased tissue 
would contain the cells which produce blood cells 
jeanpierres attorney edward jordan wanted a guardian 
appointed for the twins in hopes the guardian will recommend 
allowing the boys 3yearold halfbrother and halfsister to be 
tested 
the twins mother nancy curran opposes testing and the judge 
ruled july 18 that she has no power to overrule her ms curran 
claims the blood tests would be an invasion of privacy may be 
painful and could subject the twins to lasting medical problems 
to subject a healthy child to bodily intrusions against the 
will of the custodial parent in order to attempt to save a diseased 
child is not a duty the courts can impose upon a child or 
anyone else the judge said 
ms currans attorney beverly pekala said theres no need for 
guardians 
the trial record is replete with evidence that all children 
involved with this case have had their interests zealously 
protected she argued 
jeanpierres father tamas bosze said ms curran whos a 
former girlfriend is wrong to forbid the compatibility tests 
the children would decide differently if they were grown up 
bosze said if my brother asked me for a blood test i would say 
sure 
bosze said jeannepierre recently underwent five days of 
chemotherapy and that doctors are close to bringing the disease 
under control to allow a transplant he said many nonrelatives 
have volunteered as donors but none has proved to be compatible

a study today concludes that the only medication 
approved for treating alzheimers disease is useless and may 
actually make the disease worse 
researchers found that patients who took hydergine the 11th 
most prescribed drug in the world deteriorated faster than those 
who got dummy pills 
in their report the researchers said this was a surprise and 
they were unsure why it happened 
we can only speculate that the drug may cause cognitive 
dysfunction perhaps through a direct toxic effect or by 
accelerating the progression of alzheimers disease they wrote 
researchers described the study conducted on 80 older adults at 
the university of colorado medical school as the most extensive 
us attempt to evaluate the drugs effects the findings were 
published in todays new england journal of medicine 
hydergine is the only drug approved by the food and drug 
administration for treatment of alzheimers an incurable brain 
disease that slowly robs its victims of the ability to function 
the drug supposedly reduces memory loss and other symptoms of 
dementia 
its a useless drug said one of the studys authors dr 
christopher m filley assistant professor at the medical school 
the study begun in 1985 was paid for by the sandoz 
pharmaceuticals corp of east hanover nj which has manufactured 
and marketed hydergine worldwide for more than 20 years the drug 
costs patients about 700 a year 
patients in the sixmonth study were given either a placebo or 
the drug neither the doctor nor the patient knew which substance 
was being administered those getting hydergine scored worse on 
tests that measured mental function and behavior 
filley said some patients hold out great hope for hydergine and 
may perceive that the drug is helping in some way he said he will 
continue to prescribe the drug for those patients 
alzheimers is believed to affect as many as 4 million americans

president mikhail s gorbachev has restored the 
citizenship of exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyn and 22 other 
prominent soviets now living abroad a presidential spokesman 
confirmed today 
valentin kulikov a representative of gorbachevs press office 
told the tass news agency a presidential decree on restoration of 
citizenship also applies to writers vasily aksyonov vladimir 
voinovich lev kopelev and georgi vladimov scientists yuri orlov 
valeri chalidze and chess player viktor korchnoi were also among 
those covered by the decree issued wednesday 
the government newspaper izvestia added the name of an artist 
oskar rabin 
a complete list was not provided and there was no mention of 
nobel prizewinning writer joseph brodsky a soviet official 
suggested wednesday that he would be included in those having their 
citizenship restored brodsky a poet and essayist emigrated to 
new york in 1972 under threat of imprisonment for his political 
comments 
under leonid i brezhnev the soviet government revoked the 
citizenship of prominent authors and artists who spoke out against 
domestic repression tass said the order dealt with injustices 
that occurred between 1966 and 1988 
gennady cheremnykh head of the citizenship and pardoning 
department of the supreme soviets secretariat told izvestia that 
solzhenitsyn had agreed to accept soviet citizenship 
solzhenitsyns wife indicated otherwise 
in a statement issued in her husbands name from their vermont 
home natalia solzhenitsyn said wednesday in solzhenitsyns 
case the original decree was not only a deprivation of 
citizenship but before that a forced eviction from the ussr 
that was accomplished through arrest and the accusation of treason 
since nothing has been said about that in todays resolution it 
does not apply to solzhenitsyn 
solzhenitsyn is the author of the gulag archipelago which 
depicted the horrors of dictator josef stalins prison camps he 
was charged with high treason in 1974 stripped of his citizenship 
and exiled 
solzhenitsyn won the nobel prize for literature in 1970 his 
other works include one day in the life of ivan denisovich and 
cancer ward 
he has said he would not return to the soviet union unless all 
his books were published and widely available a number of his 
books have been printed but almost nothing is widely available in 
the shortageplagued soviet union 
korchnoi welcomed the restoration of his soviet citizenship as 
an important step but he said he would not return home 
i have predicted years ago that gorbachev will make great 
moves toward democratization korchnoi said in a telephone 
interview this is another step very important for the future 
because of its humanitarian nature 
he said he was honored to be on the list of outstanding 
persons covered by the decree but i will not make use of the 
opportunity to go home said korchnoi who was reached at his 
home in northeastern switzerland 
the full list of 23 writers academics and musicians deprived of 
citizenship and now getting it back will be published later this 
month in a parliamentary periodical kulikov said 
among those listed are 
orlov a prominent dissident and one of the founders of the 
helsinki monitoring group in moscow arrested and exiled for his 
human rights work he was allowed to leave for the united states 
after the soviets released american journalist nick daniloff 
rabin one of the organizers of a nonconformist art exhibit in 
moscow that was bulldozed in 1974 he was later forced to emigrate 
aksyonov author of the 1960 bestseller kollegi he was 
criticized by soviet authorities for his bad language which 
actually was the slang of soviet youth he emigrated after a brush 
with the authorities in 1980

iraqs president saddam hussein today 
accused president bush of trying to discredit him by labeling him a 
liar and claimed bush was misleading the american people about the 
persian gulf crisis 
we continue to pray and pray hard to god so that there will be 
no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of americans 
wrapped in sad coffins saddam said in a statement read by an 
announcer on iraqi television 
you president of the united states have chosen to be a 
liar he said in comments translated by the associated press 
you have lied to your people 
if there is a military clash he said youre going to be 
defeated 
i used to think that you were much more farsighted than you 
actually displayed the iraqi president said in a statement 
billed as an open letter to bush 
a spoken translation also was provided by cable news network 
but since the speech was aimed at bush it also carried 
subtitles provided by iraqi tv 
in his most personal statement to date on the crisis that began 
with his aug 2 invasion of kuwait the iraqi president accused 
bush of trying to humiliate arabs by the use of us military force 
saddams statement came as jordans king hussein was flying to 
maine from washington to meet with bush the jordanian monarch was 
reportedly bearing a message from saddam 
a day earlier in a speech at the pentagon bush said saddam had 
lied to his arab neighbors about his intentions in kuwait and said 
such dishonesty made him a threat to strategic saudi arabia 
it is saddam who invaded an arab state it is saddam who now 
threatens the arab nation bush said then we by contrast now 
seek to assist our arab friends in their hour of need 
iraq has insisted it has no intention of attacking saudi arabia 
where about 20000 us troops already have been dispatched to 
counter any further iraqi seizure of the huge oil reserves in the 
persian gulf other nations with troops in saudi arabia include 
egypt syria morocco and bangladesh 
in the statement saddam referred to iraq as this great arab 
nation chosen by god to be the nation of prophets 
without directly mentioning his own occupation of kuwait saddam 
said the foreign forces in saudi arabia were the true occupiers 
saddams overthrow of kuwait has been widely condemned by the 
international community which has imposed choking economic 
sanctions against him 
in the statement saddam repeated a threat to act to defend 
islamic holy sites in saudi arabia an indirect threat against the 
multinational forces in the desert kingdom 
saddams statement also followed a report earlier today by the 
egypts middle east news agency saying the iraqi president had 
been the target of an assassination attempt 
the report quoted travelers from iraq as saying the alleged 
assassination bid had prompted largescale arrests and a military 
clampdown in the iraqi capital the report could not be 
independently confirmed

aids has become the leading cause of death 
among adult men in the west african city of abidjan the magazine 
science says it is the second most common cause in adult women 
there after deaths related to pregnancy and abortion 
a recent study in the ivory coast capital city found a minimum 
annual incidence of aids of 1447 cases per million in adult men 
and 340 per million in adult women science said in its aug 17 
edition 
the study of cadavers was done in a 62day and 43day period 
among 698 adult bodies examined 41 percent of men and 32 percent 
of women were infected with hiv the agent that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome the highest rates were found in men and 
women aged 30 to 39 
science said the figures probably underestimate the true 
mortality due to hiv infection among factors skewing the figures 
were the exclusion of pediatric patients the unknown proportion of 
aids deaths not brought to the mortuaries studied and the cultural 
practice of seriously ill persons leaving abidjan to die in their 
home areas 
in addition deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis the third 
ranking cause of male adult death specifically were not counted 
as aids cases although 50 percent of such cadavers tested hiv 
positive 
although data concerning mortality due to aids are scarce 
the article said aids is likely to be the leading cause of adult 
death in a number of other african cities also 
in the united states according to the centers for disease 
control there were 161 cases of aids per 100000 population in 
the year ending in july

zairean students occupied their embassy in 
beijing holding the ambassador and five staff members inside and 
said thursday they would not end the 2dayold standoff until their 
government paid for air tickets home 
the students began occupying the embassy tuesday to protest the 
zairean governments failure to provide promised living allowances 
and air tickets home for graduates about 40 were in the embassy 
thursday 
last year zairean students staged a 10day sitin at the 
embassy for the same reason 
there are more than 80 zairean students in china and they have 
not received government subsidies for the past 14 months seven 
graduates whose air tickets were to be provided by the zaire 
government have had no way of returning home 
the students were not armed but they locked the embassy 
compound gates with a bicycle chain and refused to allow the 
ambassador and five other diplomats or embassy personnel out 
chinese staff were not allowed to enter 
on thursday ambassador lombo lo mangamanga said he arranged for 
the chinese government to provide transportation home for the 
students who needed it but the protesters refused to accept this 
arguing that their government should honor its promises the 
students resolved not to leave the embassy until the zaire 
government pays for the tickets 
the ambassador said the tickets were an advance from the chinese 
government and that the zaire government would pay for them once 
funds arrived in beijing 
its a recurring problem said lega a machinery student at 
tianjin university who gave only his first name students will 
have the same fight next year if we accept this settlement 
both the ambassador and the students said no progress has been 
made on getting funds for the students living allowances 
the students have said their government should stop sending 
students to china if it is unable to provide promised money and 
plane tickets 
the zaireans are one of the largest groups of african students 
in china under friendship agreements signed in the 1960s china 
gives scholarships to students from many african countries to 
complete degree programs in china usually in the sciences

the ruling partys central committee 
has endorsed resolutions calling for adoption of a multiparty 
system and new election laws meeting a key demand of rebels 
fighting the government 
the party frelimo endorsed the changes at a nineday meeting 
that ended wednesday the government news agency aim said the 
central committee unanimously voted in support of the two 
resolutions 
president joaquim chissano said july 31 he wanted to see a 
multiple party system in place for parliamentary and presidential 
elections scheduled next year chissano had opposed a multiparty 
system until early this year saying it would encourage tribalism 
and waste the countrys scarce resources 
but he also has promised to end the civil war which has claimed 
600000 lives and caused widespread hunger among mozambiques 15 
million people 
mozambique national resistance rebels have been fighting the 
government for 13 years their demands include free elections under 
a multiparty system 
frelimo has been the sole legal political party in the southeast 
african nation since mozambique gained independence from portugal 
in 1975 frelimo was marxist but it has undergone reforms in 
recent years and officially dropped its marxist label last year 
according to the resolution for a multiparty system it would be 
illegal for parties to be set up according to racial ethnic 
regional or religious lines aim reported forming a party would 
require proven support of at least 1100 eligible voters 
the other resolution calls for changes in the current election 
law to create a voter registration process and address the question 
of proportional representation it also recommended that peasants 
and women be included in the electoral process 
aim said two working groups have been set up to draft the laws 
which would be submitted to the peoples assembly or parliament

after 20 turbulent months of 
democracy many pakistanis are fondly reminiscing about gen 
mohammad zia ul haq and preparing to honor the military dictator 
who ruled for more than a decade 
zia died two years ago friday in a mysterious plane crash 
everyone on board was killed including several top generals and 
the us ambassador to pakistan arnold raphael 
the anniversary of zias death comes less than two weeks after 
benazir bhuttos government was dismissed on charges of corruption 
nepotism and ineptitude 
ms bhutto whose father was ousted by zia in 1977 claims a 
similar coup was staged against her but camouflaged by relying on 
the constitution to oust her 
her father zulfikar ali bhutto was hanged in 1979 on charges 
of conspiring in a murder attempt on a political enemy ms bhutto 
blamed zia for her fathers execution 
while she was prime minister ms bhutto proclaimed her father a 
martyr a similar claim now is being made by zias son ijaz ul haq 
sixfoothigh posters of the former military ruler line the wide 
boulevards of the capital giant banners proclaiming zia a martyr 
flutter in the warm summer breeze 
zia gave pakistan back its honor ijaz said 
hundreds of people daily make the pilgrimage to zias grave he 
is remembered by many as a humble and compassionate man 
ijaz a 38yearold banker plans to use his fathers death 
anniversary to launch his political career elections are scheduled 
oct 24 but speculation is rife they will be postponed and that 
another round of military rule is inevitable 
benazir bhuttos father was a civilian dictator and she came 
to power why cant the son of zia ul haq asked ijaz 
i believed in what my father did there is no doubt about 
it he said 
a framed picture of the former dictator dominates ijazs living 
room propped up at its side is a smaller picture of zia one hand 
on his heart in front of the white house with former president 
reagan striking a similar pose 
his father was buried at islamabads faisal mosque one of the 
worlds largest mosques 
on the eve of the anniversary the sprawling grounds of the 
giant mosque at the foot of the lush margalla hills took on the 
atmosphere of a festival 
brightly colored tents were erected and vendors hawking fast 
food ice cream and souvenirs set up stalls 
ijaz will place wreaths on the graves of the generals killed 
along with his father before traveling in a procession to the 
faisal mosque on friday 
the ceremony will be launched with a prayer to be said at 
exactly 351 pm the time zias the hercules c130 crashed into a 
desert plain in eastern punjab province 
zia had been at bahawalpur to witness a demonstration of the 
usmade m1 tank the plane had been in the air less than five 
minutes when it weaved out of control and nosedived into the 
desert according to witnesses 
a technical raport charged sabotage but a criminal 
investigation was never pursued ms bhuttos government made a 
weak attempt at probing the crash and the us government waited a 
year before sending investigators 
ijaz blames alzulfikar a group led by ms bhuttos brother 
murtaza that group hijacked a plane in the mid1980s and 
according to zia were behind several failed assassination attempts 
he also claims pakistans president ghulam ishaq khan the army 
and the united states staged a coverup

housing starts in july remained mired at 
depths not seen since the last recession the government reported 
thursday and analysts forecast little if any improvement for the 
remainder of the year 
were in a severe slump said economist rob rosenblatt of 
the mortgage bankers association 
a housing recession added lawrence a hunter deputy chief 
economist with the us chamber of commerce 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
fell for the sixth straight month down 26 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 115 million units 
that was the lowest level since builders began 114 million 
units at an annual rate in september 1982 two months before the 
economy emerged from the 198182 recession starts have not fallen 
for six consecutive months since junenovember 1981 
even building permits often a harbinger of future housing 
activity offered no solace they fell 26 percent to an annual 
rate of 108 million 
for the first seven months of 1990 the building pace was 96 
percent below the same period last year during all of 1989 138 
million homes were built still down from the current business 
cycle peak of 181 million in 1986 
analysts blame the situation on credit restrictions following 
the savings and loan crisis a glut of unsold homes and high 
vacancy rates in apartment buildings 
david berson chief economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said mortgage rates should decline later this year 
resulting in a slight increase in home sales and a subsequent 
pickup in singlefamily starts at year end 
john a tuccillo chief economist with the national association 
of realtors also cited economic conditions that are causing a drop 
in consumer confidence 
people simply are uncertain about what lies ahead and are 
pulling out of the market he said 
berson said the multifamily sector has very high vacancy rates 
because of overbuilding in the late 1980s 
those vacant units are going to have to be worked off before 
builders decide to start increasing the pace of multifamily 
building he said 
construction of singlefamily units fell 14 percent to an 
annual rate of 873000 units in july following a 13 percent 
decline a month earlier multifamily starts were down 65 percent 
to an annual rate of 275000 units after a 49 percent drop in june 
starts slumped in all regions except the west where 
construction jumped 87 percent to an annual rate of 317000 units 
but starts fell sharply in the south down 67 percent to an 
annual rate of 498000 units they were off 55 percent to 225000 
units in the midwest and 53 percent to 108000 units in the 
northeast

the city and its police department have 
been dismissed from a 28 million lawsuit filed by a man who spent 
16 months in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of a 1982 
armed robbery 
lenell geter an aerospace engineer formerly employed by 
esystems filed a 28 million lawsuit against the city the police 
department and lt jim fortenberry after he fought successfully to 
overturn a 1982 armed robbery conviction 
as it stands now the city owes lenell geter absolutely 
nothing city attorney dianne callander said after us district 
judge barefoot sanders issued his ruling tuesday 
geters case drew national attention when it was profiled on 
cbs 60 minutes 
geter who is black was convicted by an allwhite jury in 
dallas county and sentenced to life in prison in october 1982 he 
served 16 months before his conviction was overturned and 
prosecutors backed away from retrying him in 1985 
all the claims in the case now have been dismissed except the 
civil claims against fortenberry 
the lawsuit charged that fortenberry set in motion a 
conspiracy among area police departments when he received a tip 
that geter was two miles from the scene of an august 1982 robbery 
of a kentucky fried chicken restaurant in greenville in suburban 
dallas 
the tip developed into an investigation of geter and five other 
black engineers who later joined geter in his lawsuit 
the charges against geter were filed despite the fact that 
fellow esystems employees said geter was at work an hours drive 
away on the day of the balch springs robbery 
attempts today to contact geter by telephone were unsuccessful 
he has since moved back to his home state of south carolina 
sanders decision came just hours before guilty of 
innocence the movie about geters case was rebroadcast by cbs

traffic is thinning at the jordanian port of 
aqaba iraqs main outlet to the world according to shipping 
intelligence reported thursday 
insurance rates meanwhile have risen for persian gulf and red 
sea shipping because of the crisis in the region 
the lloyds list international newspaper said iraqs fleet of 80 
tankers and cargo ships has stopped regular trading 
with the united states pressing jordan to join the international 
embargo by closing aqaba to iraqi cargo shipping owners said 
traffic into the red sea port and the gulf will continue declining 
as costs and physical risks increase 
the united nations ordered the sanctions after iraq announced 
the annexation of neighboring kuwait on aug 8 jordan iraqs main 
arab ally has not committed itself to the embargo 
president bush has threatened to block aqaba to iraqi trade if 
iraq continues getting supplies from jordan he met thursday in 
maine with jordans king hussein 
john prescott a shipping correspondent for lloyds list 
international said latest information was that there was no 
shipping in kuwaiti or iraqi ports and that aqaba activity was 
trailing off 
aqababound ships loaded with cargo before the crisis began are 
obliged to deliver it unless a warship bars their way said peter 
tudball vice chairman of the baltic exchange the international 
organization that matches ship owners with freight movers 
ship owners have refused cargo destined for aqaba since iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait he said 
there are usually 20 to 30 sizable ships in aqaba on any given 
day but there certainly wouldnt be anyone at the moment 
willing to take any cargo into aqaba he said 
all ship owners will be wary they dont want an exocet 
missile through their ships that limits their trading 
possibilities in the future 
another reason is cost marine underwriters at the lloyds of 
london insurance market have suggested insurers charge an 
additional 1 percent of total insured value on ships going into the 
arabian gulf coast 
lloyds does not give money figures tudball gave an example 
saying operators of a supertanker worth 80 million would be 
charged an extra 800000 for up to seven days in the crisis zone 
leading shipping firms have added a 200 surcharge for each 
container on ships going to jiddah saudi arabia said jeff barlax 
a spokesman for p and o containers ltd a british shipping 
concern that is part of the trio consortium of european japanese 
and us lines 
barlax said surcharges are being considered for ships going to 
bahrain and the united arab emirates in the persian gulf 
tudball thinks few ships will break sanctions and risk losing 
their insurance in life you always do get pirates and if the 
right money is there ships will go in but they will be very few 
and far between he said 
the stoppage in iraqi shipping was an indication that the 
moves to isolate the country commercially are starting to take 
effect lloyds list international reported 
the newspaper said there was no record of threequarters of the 
iraqi fleet entering port since aug 2 
the iraqi fleet especially its 20 tankers will find it 
difficult to pick up cargo while the crisis continues lloyds 
list said and it is likely that without the prospect of 
receiving cargoes the iraqis have decided it is pointless to send 
their ships into unfriendly ports 
it said iraqs isolation would be a problem for its ships which 
depend on foreign repair facilities

now 14 new road signs direct west virginia drivers down the road

the letters can be removed and the signs corrected 
we dont want to offend anyone with the spelling kobesky

a federal jury today began deliberating the 
cases of three former northwest airlines pilots accused of being 
drunk when they flew a passenger plane from north dakota to 
minnesota 
us district judge james rosenbaum instructed the jury to 
consider separately whether the defendants are guilty of operating 
an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol 
rosenbaum said jurors should consider this definition of being 
under the influence of alcohol when a person is so affected by 
alcohol that he lacks clearness of intellect and control of 
himself that he would otherwise have 
jurors got the case after hearing closing arguments and 
rebuttals wednesday and today 
in their closing arguments defense attorneys said their clients 
may have used poor judgment by drinking the night before flying a 
boeing 727 but they are innocent of flyingwhileintoxicated 
charges 
its not against the law to drink alcohol and fly a plane 
maybe it should be peter wold attorney for capt norman lyle 
prouse said in closing arguments wednesday its only against 
the law if you are under the influence and there is not one 
piece of evidence suggesting he was 
prouse 51 of conyers ga 1st officer robert kirchner 36 of 
highland ranch colo and flight engineer joseph balzer 35 of 
antioch tenn have been on trial since july 25 on charges of 
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol 
closing arguments for balzer were scheduled today in us 
district court 
according to undisputed testimony balzer and kirchner shared 
beer from at least six pitchers and prouse consumed 15 to 20 rum 
and colas at a lounge in moorhead minn on march 7 a waitress 
testified that balzer and kirchner left about 1030 pm and prouse 
left about 1130 pm six hours later on march 8 the trio flew a 
boeing 727 with 91 passengers from fargo nd to the twin cities 
it was stupid of him kirchner to stay in the bar defense 
attorney william mauzy said 
but mauzy cautioned dont condemn them because they were in a 
bar because thats not what they are charged with 
the case marks the us justice departments first prosecution 
under a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a common carrier 
while under the influence of alcohol the law doesnt specify a 
bloodalcohol content for pilots to return guilty verdicts jurors 
must conclude the pilots were impaired 
defense attorneys said the smoothness of the flight showed the 
pilots were not impaired 
there wasnt anything about that flight that wasnt perfect 
mauzy said thats the best evidence you need to know about 
whether bob kirchner was impaired 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega said in her closing 
argument that the pilots were able to handle flight 650 because it 
was routine she reminded jurors that a northwest pilot called as a 
defense witness described flying as hours of boredom punctuated 
by minutes of terror 
these three defendants were not capable to respond to those 
minutes of terror de la vega said 
in tests about two hours after the flight landed kirchner 
showed a bloodalcohol concentration of 006 percent balzer showed 
008 percent and prouse showed 013 percent prouses 
bloodalcohol level was more than the legal limit for driving a car 
in many states which is 010 percent 
the federal felony carries a maximum 15 years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
the three pilots were fired for violating northwests 12hour 
prohibition against drinking before flying 
in a report in the new england journal of medicine today two 
doctors said even a little alcohol can hinder pilots ability to 
fly and recommended that federal rules bar pilots from taking the 
controls until at least 12 hours after their last drink 
the weight of the evidence suggests that even small amounts of 
alcohol can have a profoundly negative effect on flight safety 
said drs jack g modell and james m mountz of the university of 
michigan

saudi arabia today called for an 
emergency meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to discuss how to deal with the market situation in light 
of the iraqkuwait crisis 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer said that the kingdom along 
with other unidentified members of the cartel have asked for an 
immediate opec meeting to discuss a unified decision on dealing 
with conditions of the market 
no date or site for the meeting was announced 
the minister in a short official statement denied the kingdom 
had notified any of its customers of any cutbacks in oil supply for 
september 
earlier in the day the japanese foreign ministry said saudi 
arabia had notified us european and japanese oil companies of a 
15 percent to 20 percent cutback in its oil supply for the month of 
september 
the japanese officials said no reason was given for the reported 
planned cutbacks which followed reports that the saudis would 
boost daily output from 54 million barrels to more than 7 million 
barrels to offset the loss of iraqi oil being blocked by a 
worldwide embargo when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 it increased 
its share of the worlds oil reserves to 20 percent 
at the most recent opec meeting which concluded in geneva 
switzerland on july 27 the 13 opec ministers raised the target 
price of oil 3 to 21 a barrel they also agreed not to exceed the 
production ceiling of 225 million barrels a day until the end of 
the year 
earlier this year the price declined to the low 16 range 
partly because crude output by opec and other producers was 
outpacing world demand 
prices began rising earlier this summer after the cartel reached 
an agreement to restrain production they shot sharply higher after 
the invasion of kuwait on speculation that iraq might attack saudi 
arabia the worlds largest oil exporter 
at the opec meeting in july iraq accused kuwait and the united 
arab emirates of overproducing oil and thus driving down the price 
for oil iraq which relies heavily on oil sales to keep its 
economy afloat used the dispute over oil and territory to justify 
its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
takahiro nakamae of japans ministry of international trade and 
industrys petroleum planning department said earlier today that 
even it the report of the planned saudi oil cutback for september 
is confirmed it will have little effect on japans overall oil 
supply 
japan he noted has 142 days worth of oil in reserve 
japan has agreed to participate in a full trade embargo on iraq 
and kuwait which were supplying 420000 barrels a day or 11 
percent of japans oil imports japan is dependent on the middle 
east for nearly 70 percent of its oil virtually all of which is 
imported 
but nakamae said japan can offset the iraqi and kuwait oil and 
the reported planned cutback by the saudis by importing more oil 
from other sources

pentagon sources today disclosed 
plans to deploy 45000 marines to the inflamed persian gulf region 
to supplement the thousands of army navy and air force troops 
already committed president bush met with king hussein of jordan 
as tensions heightened 
in washington the state department said the 2500 americans in 
kuwait were given two hours by the iraqi military today to move to 
a hotel to protect them against unspecified threats the us 
ambassador in kuwait protested the order and the state department 
said obviously the situation is of concern to us 
the size of the marine deployment became known as one source 
said the president had given naval commanders in the persian gulf 
permission to use minimum force to halt shipments to and from 
iraq in enforcement of a unbacked trade embargo 
those steps could include attempting to block the ships passage 
or firing a warning shot across the bow a senior administration 
source in washington said wednesday night the presidents message 
was expected to be sent today to the us navy fleet in middle east 
waters 
while the orders were going out to the fleet air force 
officials discussed the maneuverings in the skies above the middle 
east air force crew chiefs in saudi arabia said iraqi planes have 
turned and flown away several times after weapons systems radar 
aboard us jets have locked onto them 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said today that iraq 
has continued to increase its armed forces in kuwait and that 
intelligence reports estimate their number at 160000 he said 
there has been no major change in the character of the forces 
which the pentagon earlier described as having a defensive 
appearance 
the size of the marine deployment was disclosed by officials 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
in a separate interview with the ap gen john dailey assistant 
commandant of the marine corps said the service has sent a 
substantial armada of assault troops the largest since the 
vietnam war 
we dont just arrive the fourstar general said in an 
interview were there to stay for a fairly lengthy period 
bush back at his maine vacation home after a 24hour trip to 
washington was expected to press hussein to cooperate with the 
international effort to force saddam to roll back his invading army 
from kuwait 
hussein made his trip to the united states in his selfappointed 
role as mediator in the twoweek crisis and is believed to be 
carrying a private message from iraqs president to bush 
but the public announcement from iraq during the day was hardly 
conciliatory president saddam hussein warned that if there is 
military confrontation you will receive thousands of americans 
wrapped in sad coffins 
the crisis began two weeks ago when saddam sent his tank army 
into kuwait swiftly overrunning resistance and seizing control of 
the nations large oil reserves american officials said 
intelligence information showed saddam was then positioning his 
troops as if to invade saudi arabia and bush responded with the 
largest american military deployment since vietnam and an effort 
to organize an international trade blockade 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat said 
today he didnt know whether saddam was proposing any specific 
steps but said of the message its a call for peace peace with 
justice 
i dont know really the content of it but there were 
principles that were enunciated by our president in his 
initiative almashat said on the fox morning news maybe there 
are some practical steps to be implemented 
the white house piqued at the kings efforts to defend saddam 
downplayed any expectations of a breakthrough in the crisis ignited 
by iraqs blitzkrieg aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the white house said bush would meet later today with saudi 
arabias foreign minister prince saud alfaisal and the saudi 
ambassador to the united states prince bander bin sultan 
the instruction on interdiction of iraqi ships described a 
stepbystep approach under which commanders should first request 
ships to halt and seek their cooperation before taking any more 
aggressive steps the administration source said 
the instruction will tell them to use the minimum force 
necessary said the source adding that might include steps taken 
to disable a ship so that it couldnt continue on its way 
american fighter jet crews in saudi arabia meanwhile are 
describing maneuverings in the air along the kuwaitsaudi border 
involving us and iraqi planes several crew chiefs said iraqi 
fighters turned in retreat after the weapons systems aboard 
american jets locked onto the iraqi targets 
one of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the 
radar locks on one crew chief said theres been a little 
catandmouse but when the weapons lock on theyre gone 
another said they dont want to play with us one said of the 
iraqis 
bush on the golf course wednesday after returning to maine from 
a military briefing at the pentagon said just wait and see what 
happens when asked what he expected from the meeting with the 
jordanian monarch 
bush addressing pentagon employees after a briefing by his top 
generals expressed his determination to enforce the un embargo 
by land and sea 
together we must ensure that no goods get in and that not one 
drop of oil gets out said bush the president said tuesday that 
could mean shutting down the jordanian port of aqaba if goods keep 
flowing into iraq through that port on the red sea 
defense department sources said 22 f117a stealth fighters were 
leaving today for the persian gulf the radarevading jets saw 
their first combat in panama last december the aircraft carrier 
john f kennedy and its eightship battle group left for the middle 
east on wednesday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
has not yet decided whether it must call up reserves to boost the 
fastpaced us military buildup in the saudi desert and persian 
gulf

more than half the us population still lives 
in cities plagued by too much smog and one third in areas with 
dangerously high carbon monoxide the environmental protection 
agency said thursday 
most major cities 119 in all flunked air quality checks for 
at least several days during the past three years and some such as 
los angeles and new york failed much more frequently the epa said 
eighteen cities violated standards for both smog and carbon 
monoxide meaning in most cases they have major pollution problems 
in both summer and winter months 
these lists demonstrate the magnitude of the air pollution 
problem still remaining in this country said epa deputy 
administrator f henry habicht 
the total number of cities was down five from last year taking 
into account cities added to or dropped from the lists 
but habicht said 133 million people still live in areas 
exceeding the smog standard and almost 78 million are in areas that 
are over the carbon monoxide limit 
the epa listed 96 areas where monitoring of the air showed that 
smog or ozone levels were too high more than three times since 
1987 anything over 012 parts per million is considered a 
violation of federal standards the lists didnt say how far over 
that level the cities went 
the worst area at least from the standpoint of number of days 
of violation was the los angelesanaheimriverside area of 
california with 137 days followed by bakersfield calif with 44 
days and new york city with 17 
another list included 41 areas where carbon monoxide levels 
exceeded the limit of 9 parts per million on two or more days in 
either 1988 or 1989 
los angeles led again with 71 days followed by spokane wash 
with 37 days oshkosh wis with 32 the area of steubenville 
ohio and weirton wva with 31 and then new york and las vegas 
nev with 26 
smog is primarily a summertime problem caused by the 
interaction of the more intense sunlight with chemicals in the air 
carbon monoxide becomes more difficult to control in the winter 
when temperature inversions keep more pollutants in the lower 
atmosphere 
both can cause health problems ranging from eye irritation to 
heart ailments 
most major cities in this country are still not meeting at 
least one of these standards said warren freas spokesman for 
the epas air quality office 
the lists which include complex data on the degree to which 
each area is violating the standards are used by the epa to 
determine whether state clean air plans can be approved or if new 
actions must be taken these can include requirements for increased 
automobile inspections or lesspolluting gasoline mixtures 
the epa said it would use the lists to determine any new 
requirements that cities must meet under the clean air act being 
worked out by a housesenate conference committee 
the 18 areas on both lists include the nations largest urban 
areas more than a third are in california los angeles san 
franciscooakland fresno modesto sacramento san diego and 
stockton 
the others are new york boston hartford conn baltimore 
philadelphia washington greensborowinston salem nc memphis 
tenn raleighdurham nc cleveland and el paso texas 
eight areas were dropped from the smog list from last year 
columbia sc jacksonville fla lafayette ind phoenix 
huntsville ala anderson sc tulsa okla and portland ore 
three were added smyth county va the johnson 
citykingsportbristol area in tennessee and virginia and 
evansville ind 
seven areas are newly meeting carbon monoxide standards 
manchester nh oklahoma city st louis great falls mont 
greeley colo salt lake city and yakima wash 
new to the list of violators syracuse ny philadelphia

iraqi military authorities in kuwait today instructed all 
americans and britons to assemble at hotels in the emirate us 
officials said the order was unjusfified britain condemned it as 
grave and sinister 
what we fear is that they will be interned somewhere most 
likely in iraq britains foreign office minister william 
waldegrave said in london 
the us state department said the 2500 americans in kuwait 
were given two hours to move to a hotel to protect them against 
unspecified threats 
the international hotel where the americans were told to 
gather is opposite the us embassy in kuwait city 
initially the iraqi authorities told the us ambassador in 
kuwait nathaniel howell that the americans should go to central 
points such as hotels but then it became clear they meant the 
kuwaiti international state department spokesman richard boucher 
said in washington 
howell protested the order as unjustified and impratical 
britain whose 4000 nationals in kuwait were ordered to go to 
the regency hotel has contacted its european community partners 
and other allies to see if similar demands had been made on other 
foreign communities in kuwait 
the reports came as thousands of foreigners streamed into jordan 
from iraq including a few westerners a senior jordanian official 
said but baghdad refused to allow most americans west europeans 
and japanese to leave 
those crossing into jordan included three us citizens of 
indian origin three bangladeshis with dual british and bangladeshi 
nationality and a frenchwoman according to a senior jordanian 
security official 
a us embassy spokesman in jordan said the mission was aware of 
the jordanian officials statement but did not know anything about 
the americans who reportedly crossed the border 
iraqi authorities said the order that britons and american 
assemble was given for their own safety waldegrave said but he 
said if internment is iraqs intention baghdad should draw 
back and reconsider 
he said the british embassy had been instructed to send a 
diplomat to the regency hotel in kuwait city diplomats were not 
among those ordered to assemble and no deadline was given the 
minister said 
earlier today britains foreign office had said a convoy of 28 
cars carrying 112 britons had left kuwait for baghdad they were 
mainly dependents and nonessential staff in the embassy and the 
wives and children of a british military liaison team and a few 
members of the british community it said 
meanwhile the soviet news agency tass said the first group of 
230 soviet evacuees from kuwait was in baghdad awaiting charter 
flights out but soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
told a briefing that the group would be transferred to the soviet 
union via the iraqiran border 
the iraqi ambassador to the united nations said today that his 
country will not give top priority to the evacuation of westerners 
because of threats from abroad dr abdul amir alnbarie said in a 
bbc radio interview that iraq was subject to tremendous threats 
and intimidation from other countries 
overall more than 2 million foreigners were trapped in iraq and 
kuwait after iraq invaded its oilrich neighbor on aug 2 and later 
annexed it the foreigners include 2500 americans in kuwait and 
500 in iraq 
waldegrave said britain was protesting to authorities in baghdad 
and elsewhere and would raise the issue at the united nations 
i hope that these reports and the storm of protest that will 
break around the head of iraq if she pursues any policy of 
interning people will make her draw back from any such policy if 
that is what she contemplates he said 
an emergency message was broadcast on a british broadcasting 
corp channel passing the iraqi order to the 4000 britons living 
in kuwait to assemble at the regency the radio message advised the 
britons to be prepared for a prolonged stay by taking supplementary 
food and a minimum kit 
waldegrave called the order a further example of the duplicity 
of the iraqi regime which earlier had referred to the foreigners 
as guests he said the iraqi order came without warning and 
contained a clear threat 
while most westerners are free to travel within iraq and kuwait 
a group of 36 americans and two britons has been restricted to a 
luxury hotel in baghdad according to abc news they had taken from 
kuwait city to baghdad 
abc said the detainees in the hotel are being treated rather 
well spending much of their day at the hotel pool but seem to 
be under enormous tension and are afraid they will be stuck in 
iraq until the crisis ends 
the network said an iraqi monitored conversations with the 
americans in the hotel but one of the americans said look we 
want you to tell the president of the united states that we think 
hes doing the right thing

the federal election commission on thursday 
asked for input on a proposal to ban political action committees of 
companies at least half owned by foreigners 
the 50 commission vote came several weeks after the senate 
voted 7327 to include a similar proposal in a campaign finance 
reform bill 
the fec plan by commissioner john warren mcgarry establishes a 
60day public comment period ending oct 12 the commission set an 
oct 31 public hearing 
under the proposed rule any corporation with 50 percent or more 
foreign ownership would be defined as a foreign national unable to 
participate in federal elections subsidiaries in the united states 
failing to qualify would not be allowed to contribute to campaigns 
or spend money on any federal election 
the commission also sought comments on how it should enforce the 
rule and on any other issues involving participation by foreign 
nationals in federal elections 
currently the fec allows us subsidiaries of foreign firms to 
have pacs provided the foreign owners do not control or direct 
operation of the committees 
supporting the proposal were commission chairwoman lee ann 
elliott and commissioners thomas j josefiak scott thomas and 
danny lee mcdonald 
the senate language sponsored by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
was approved as part of a bill that would impose spending ceilings 
on candidates and also try to eliminate pacs altogether 
bentsen said his amendment was intended to give legislative 
underpinning to the fec in case the senate drops the proposed ban 
on pacs in conference or if the prohibition is ruled 
unconstitutional 
bentsen cited congressional research service statistics showing 
that pacs of foreignowned companies contributed 28 million to 
candidates in the 1988 elections a 19 percent increase over 1986 
the current system he said allows foreignowned companies to 
pressure employees of their us subsidiaries to use the pac 
muscle in ways acceptable to the corporate masters in london 
frankfurt or tokyo

a judge on thursday granted a black womans 
wish that her two young girls live with an affluent suburban white 
couple ending social workers plans to place the children with 
black inner city foster parents 
milwaukee county childrens court judge ronald s goldberger 
ordered that the womans 5monthold daughter remain in the care of 
foster parents beverly and david cox of delafield a suburb about 
30 miles west of milwaukee 
the judge also ordered the womans 16monthold daughter moved 
there 
the milwaukee county department of social services wanted to put 
the girls in black foster homes in the inner city to keep them in 
the same social and economic environment as their mother 
the judge made the ruling after social worker bonnie finkler 
told the court her agency had changed its position and agreed to 
drop plans to take the 5monthold child from the coxes and place 
her with a black family 
this case is unique because of the close friendship that has 
developed between the coxes and the natural family ms finkler 
said we are hopeful that this relationship will prove to be an 
asset in reuniting mother and daughters as soon as possible 
the children were taken from their mother earlier this year 
after social workers determined the woman was unable to maintain 
a proper home for them said jeff aikin a spokesman for the 
department 
initial placements were made before social workers fully 
reviewed the circumstances the younger child was placed with the 
coxes the older one was put at a different white home but later 
moved to a black foster mothers home 
the 30yearold mother who hasnt been identified in court to 
protect her childrens identities has not contested the removal of 
her children but she petitioned the court to overrule the social 
workers on relocation 
the coxes joined the childrens mother in protesting the social 
workers decision arguing race should not affect any foster 
placement decisions 
but goldberger ruled the couple had no legal standing and that 
only the mother could appeal 
jim ries a foster care official with the department of social 
services said the older child will be placed in the cox home as 
soon as possible to reunite the two sisters 
itll happen right away but itll happen in a way that will 
make it easiest for the kids ries said 
the black foster family recently asked the department to 
withdraw as a placement alternative for the youngest girl due 
primarily to the publicity surrounding the case ms finkler said 
mrs cox said she was pleased with the judges ruling 
this will be very nice to have this out of the way and have 
all our families back to normal she said 
but she added that the childrens mother needs counseling that 
should begin right away to expedite a reunion with her four 
children the womans two older children have been living with 
relatives 
the mother has not been receiving counseling since the placement 
dispute began mrs cox said 
michael vruno a lawyer appointed by the court to represent the 
children had first advocated placement with a black family he 
changed his mind but said race was not his primary concern 
the concern that i had about these two children living with 
the coxes is that they are quite a distance from the mother 
vruno said 
he said he was convinced the coxes would continue to provide 
transportation so the children could visit their mother although 
they have no legal duty to do so 
vruno said he believes the department of social services should 
consider race in adoption cases and permanent foster placements

the 2500 americans in kuwait were given two 
hours today to move to a hotel to protect them against 
unspecified threats a senior us official said the iraqis 
implied they would round up americans who didnt cooperate 
the order by iraqi military authorities was immediately 
protested by us ambassador nathaniel howell as unjustified and 
impractical but americans were told of the request said 
richard boucher a state department spokesman 
the iraqis implied in the meeting with howell that military 
authorities would go out and find americans who didnt 
voluntarily go to the international hotel the senior us official 
said 
obviously the situation is of concern to us boucher said 
but he again declined to describe the trapped americans as hostages 
a senior us official meanwhile said the iraqis have erected 
an airdefense system around the kuwaiti capital he declined to 
say whether the weapons included missiles but the soviets have 
provided surfacetoair missiles to iraq in the past 
iraqi military authorities also have instructed all britons to 
assemble at a hotel in a move the british foreign office condemned 
as grave and sinister 
only three americans have managed to leave iraqioccupied kuwait 
in the last day or so boucher said they made their way to 
neighboring jordan although the state department has cautioned 
americans its too risky to try to leave the country 
the international hotel is opposite the us embassy in kuwait 
city initially iraqi authorities told ambassador howell the 
americans should go to central points such as hotels 
but then it became clear they meant the kuwaiti 
international boucher said 
we are not instructing them one way or another boucher 
said adding that americans in kuwait were bearing up well though 
there were some food shortages 
howell was summoned about 3 am edt to a meeting with iraqi 
military authorities boucher said 
he was asked to tell all americans they had to move to a 
central point iraqi authorities asked for compliance within 
two hours boucher said they explained that the order was a 
result of concerns about the protection of the american community 
from unspecified threats 
howell boucher said told the iraqis the order was not only 
an impractical impossibility but he also asked for an explanation 
and reminded the iraqi authorities of their responsibility for the 
safety of americans 
boucher said howell made clear that he could inform the 
americans of the request but that he had no power to order them to 
move the embassy has contacted the american community to tell 
them of this order 
boucher said the action is totally uncalled for 
most americans would be better off in their homes he said 
of course all would be better all americans all foreigners 
if they were allowed to leave and we will continue to work toward 
that goal if americans wish to move to a hotel thats fine 
rep larry smith dfla said president bush ought to tell 
iraq that he is sending a military air transport to kuwait now to 
pick up every american 
in an interview smith said the president should also tell 
them if those military transports are fired on or in any other way 
impeded or if any americans are harmed by any elements even 
disconnected to any iraqi troops in kuwait that the president of 
the united states will consider it an act of war 
about 2500 americans have been trapped in the persian gulf 
emirate since it was overrun by iraqi forces two weeks ago 
the bush administration has responded to the invasion and 
subsequent annexation of the oilrich country by pouring tens of 
thousands of troops into saudi arabia to protect its oilfields and 
dispatching a nucleararmed naval armada to the gulf region 
in addition to the americans there are about 3000 britons 500 
italians and more than 450 japanese stranded in iraq and kuwait 
on wednesday an iraqi foreign ministry officials referred to 
the americans in kuwait as restrictees 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
wednesday in response that they should not be described as hostages 
because they were not being held at gunpoint or mistreated and that 
efforts were being made to arrange their departure

the vietnam veteran general who is the 
topranking us military officer in saudi arabia and the persian 
gulf area offered a bit of advice thursday to younger troops eager 
for battle with iraq 
senior military officials who experienced vietnam consider 
combat man at his most ludicrous state and hope to avoid combat 
here air force lt gen charles horner said 
horner said todays troops are trained so hard and are so 
prepared for combat that i can understand their eagerness 
but if they stop and think they realize war is a loser for 
everyone horner told a visiting pool of american journalists 
horner is the top commander in the region and the top deputy to 
gen norman schwarzkopf commander of the us central command 
which controls us forces in southwest asia 
</TEXT>

horner said he was working very closely with saudi military 
officials but said many command functions remain to be worked out 
at a lengthy questionandanswer session thursday he repeatedly 
declined to answer queries about deployments and strategy often 
joking with reporters as he brushed aside their questions 
asked about accounts from air force crew chiefs who reported 
that iraqi planes had retreated after radar systems aboard us 
f15 fighter jets locked on them horner rolled his eyes and smiled 
before saying id like to answer your question but i choose not

the pool thursday afternoon visited the saudi air base where the 
us and saudi air forces are conducting joint exercises with awacs 
reconnaissance planes 
during a tour of one plane us air force officials said they 
had been flying missions as long as 20 hours which requires two 
aerial refuelings 
there is at least one awacs in the air around the clock 
monitoring iraqi air activity each awacs is escorted by f15s 
according to air force col tom bliss 
the awacs crews often include both saudi and american personnel 
he said 
bliss said the american planes have superior computers and other 
equipment but that the saudi awacs have newer more powerful 
engines because they were purchased several years after the 
american planes were built

one of the concerns that the folks back at the pentagon had was 
how the female soldiers assigned to operation desert shield would 
fare in saudi arabias strict maledominated society 
they neednt have worried said several female crew members 
assigned to a us awacs surveillance plane stationed in saudi 
arabia 
i thought i was going to run into problems with saudi men 
said a 21yearold female surveillance technician from michigan 
but ive had no problems so far all the saudi men ive met have 
been extremely polite 
thats not to say that no cultural misunderstandings exist 
the technician said a saudi businessman became so enamored of 
another female crew member that he offered to buy her from the 
male crewmen she was with for half a million dollars 
but saudi crew members working on the awacs planes say they have 
no difficulty working with the young american women 
its fun working with them a saudi captain said we enjoy 
them they are nice people

iraqs president saddam hussein said today he was praying for a 
peaceful resolution to the persian gulf crisis but that if a 
military confrontation erupts it could result in thousands of 
americans wrapped in sad coffins 
meanwhile in a development us officials described as 
unjustified and britain called grave and sinister iraqi 
military authorities in kuwait instructed all americans and britons 
to assemble at two hotels in the emirate 
what we fear is that they will be interned somewhere most 
likely in iraq foreign office minister william waldegrave said 
today in london 
the us state department said the 2500 americans in kuwait 
were given two hours to move to the international hotel opposite 
the us embassy in kuwait city to protect them against 
unspecified threats 
also today pentagon sources disclosed plans to send 45000 
marines to the gulf region to reinforce thousands of army navy and 
air force troops there 
the developments came as president bush met privately for two 
hours with jordans king hussein who has tried to mediate the 
showdown with iraq 
talking to reporters after the meeting hussein denied reports 
that he had carried a message from saddam to bush he also denied 
that jordan was helping iraq break an international boycott by 
allowing baghdad to export and import goods through jordans red 
sea port of aqaba 
neither hussein nor bush said what was discussed during the 
meeting and no statement about the meeting was issued 
in his statement on iraqi television billed as an open letter 
to bush saddam repeatedly accused bush of being a liar 
you president of the united states have chosen to be a 
liar he said you have lied to your people 
a day earlier in a speech at the pentagon bush had said saddam 
was a threat to saudi arabia which he has promised not to attack 
because he lied about his intentions regarding kuwait 
in another development egypts middle east news agency quoted 
travelers from iraq as saying the attempt on saddams life led to 
largescale arrests on wednesday including some close 
associates of the iraqi president and a military clampdown in the 
iraqi capital 
there was no independent confirmation of the report by the 
governmentrun news agency which did not say when the reported 
attack on saddam occurred asked about the report in washington 
state department spokesman richard boucher said at this point i 
dont have any information like that 
after extending a peace offer to archenemy iran on wednesday 
iraq expressed readiness to negotiate with us officials and the 
iraqi foreign minister said baghdad would not initiate a war 
against the united states 
however the minister tariz aziz added that if the americans 
have come to initiate a war here i think they will be sorry 
because they will lose that war he was interviewed on abcs 
nightline program 
aziz said iraq has no intention of attacking saudi arabia where 
perhaps 20000 us troops already have been dispatched to counter 
any further iraqi seizure of the huge oil reserves in the persian 
gulf 
bangladesh said wednesday it would send soldiers to join 
egyptian syrian and moroccan soldiers forming a multinational 
force with american gis to protect the saudi kingdom 
a new contingent of egyptian troops left for saudi arabia today 
the middle east news agency reported the agency did not say how 
many soldiers were in the contingent but military sources said it 
was about 1000 troops 
the us navy is also at the forefront of a maritime barricade 
of iraq aided by british west german and australian vessels 
in other developments 
a respected leftist beirut newspaper assafir today said all 
14 western hostages held in lebanon including six americans will 
be freed by the end of the year it quoted what it called 
wellinformed diplomatic sources as saying recent developments in 
the gulf put the issue on a very hot burner and that contacts 
were under way in concerned capitals particularly tehran 
two americans three britons and a frenchman were among 
thousands of foreigners mainly arabs who crossed into jordan from 
iraq today a senior jordanian official reported the westerners 
were the first to cross into jordan since saturday when baghdad 
was reported to have banned westerners from leaving in addition to 
the 2500 americans in kuwait about 500 are in iraq 
baghdad radio today quoted an unidentified iraqi air force 
spokesman as saying iraq cannot guarantee the safety of any 
foreign pilot who might be shot down over iraqi territory because 
of the rage the iraqi people and the arabs harbor for the 
aggressive foreign intervention 
several us air force crew chiefs said today iraqi planes have 
turned and flown away several times after weapons systems radar 
aboard us jets have locked onto the iraqi targets they dont 
want to play with us one crew chief said if i were in a 
mirage and an f15 locked onto me id get out of there fast too 
a senior us administration source said wednesday that bush 
authorized naval commanders to use the minimum force necessary 
to interdict shipments to and from iraq 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said bushs 
message was expected to be sent today to the us navy fleet in 
middle east waters 
bush told a military gathering at the pentagon on wednesday that 
no one should doubt our staying power in confronting iraqi 
expansionism the american way of life is imperiled by iraqi 
president saddam husseins growing control of persian gulf oil he 
said 
the aircraft carrier john f kennedy and its eightship battle 
group left norfolk va for the crisis area wednesday and 
pentagon officials said aircraft leaving soon would include f117a 
stealth fighters the us navy already has massed 27 ships 
including three carriers in the gulf the nearby arabian sea and 
the red sea 
bush was expected to press the jordanian monarch to bottle up 
jordans red sea port of aqaba to iraq it is iraqs main outlet 
now in the face of an international boycott the us navy is 
likely to set up a maritime barricade off aqaba to block iraqi 
trade if hussein fails to act 
saddam made a dramatic diplomatic gesture on wednesday 
he proposed peace to iran after their costly extremely bitter 
war from 198088 saddam suggested that iran join iraq in 
partnership against the americans who are fishing in dirty 
waters in the gulf 
iran sounded receptive the two neighbors stopped fighting under 
a unbrokered ceasefire in 1988 but signed no peace accord 
saddam said in a letter to president hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
that in exchange for a peace treaty iraq will pull its troops out 
of iranian territories occupied in the war starting friday and 
free tens of thousands of iranian pows 
iraq today said it will release 1000 iranian prisoners a day 
beginning friday

iraqi president saddam hussein on 
thursday branded president bush a liar and warned that any war with 
iraq would result in thousands of american dead 
in what was described as an open letter to bush saddam said the 
us president had lied about american objectives in the persian 
gulf region 
after iraq overran its small neighbor kuwait on aug 2 american 
and other forces moved in to protect oilrich saudi arabia fearing 
the kingdom might be the next target 
saddam repeated his assertion that iraq would never withdraw 
from kuwait the remarks were carried by the official iraqi news 
agency and monitored in nicosia 
his statement said iraqis were praying there would be no 
military confrontation which would it said lead to thousands 
of americans wrapped in sad coffins 
in response state department spokesman richard boucher said 
we havent really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears 
to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his 
attempts to distort the truth we believe that his words cannot 
distract the world from the facts of iraqi aggression 
the iraqi leader accused bush of mockery and disregard for 
arab sentiment and said the us reaction to events in the persian 
gulf convinced him even more of the need for a holy war against 
the invading forces 
saddam called for a holy war last week against the foreign 
forces in the persian gulf region 
he seemed particularly incensed by bushs assertion that he 
saddam had lied on wednesday in a speech at the pentagon bush 
said saddam deceived his arab neighbors by invading kuwait 
you have lied mr us president to your people when you 
told them that you were massing troops to protect american 
interests in saudi arabia saddam responded 
saddam also claimed he had never promised egyptian president 
hosni mubarak that his forces would not move into kuwait 
mubarak had tried to mediate the iraqi oil and land claims 
against kuwait just prior to the invasion and had expressed 
optimism a settlement was in the works then saddams army moved in 
the iraqi president repeated his claim that kuwait is an 
integral part of iraq and always has been 
we are on our soil kuwaitis and iraqis are all iraqis 
eternally he said 
iraq annexed kuwait six days after its aug 2 invasion iraqs 
official media now refer to kuwait as a southern iraqi city 
saddam said asking iraqi forces to pull out was like asking the 
us army to withdraw from the southern united states 
he repeated that kuwaits ruling alsabah family would never 
return to power and said they had brought shame on arabs by 
their alliances with their likes among the westerners and the 
americans 
twelve of the arab leagues 21 members voted last week to send 
arab forces to join the western military buildup they also voted 
to respect unordered military and economic sanctions against 
iraq 
saddam heaped scorn on the arab states that moved against him 
arent you sad as you boast about democracy that your 
allies be the retarded thieves and liars among the arabs while 
the believers the warriors nd the elite be on the opposite side 
he said 
egypt syria and morocco have so far sent troops to join the 
estimated 20000 american soldiers already in the region estimates 
of eventual american troop strength have ranged up to 250000 
the iraqi president also said the presence of outside forces in 
saudi arabia is a policy of occupation that humiliates the sacred 
shrine and lands of the arabs and moslems 
saudi arabia contains the cities of mecca and medina the two 
holiest sites in the moslem faith 
saddams statement came day after he offered iran iraqs foe in 
the 198088 war for a formal peace treaty beginning friday iraq 
will release 1000 iranian prisoners of war per day baghdad said 
thursday 
tens of thousands of iranians are imprisoned in iraq but the 
red cross organizing the repatriation said it can only handle 1000 
per day 
iraq also said it would begin on friday a withdrawal of troops 
from territory seized from iran in the final weeks of the war that 
will give saddam more manpower to focus on the brewing 
confrontation with the multinational forces deployed in the region 
iraq said the withdrawal would take five days as many as 
400000 iraq troops of saddams millionman army are stationed 
along the border with iran

the us share of world and domestic 
telecommunications equipment markets is declining the commerce 
department said thursday 
it said the falling market share was the result of foreign 
barriers to competition and reduced productivity and innovation by 
us companies aiming primarily at shortterm profit 
the department said the government and private industry need to 
take strong sustained actions to stem the negative balance of 
trade in telecommunications equipment 
in 1988 that trade balance was a negative 26 billion a 
decade earlier the balance was a positive 11 billion 
based on a twoyear study the department said the united states 
remains the worlds leader in hightech communications equipment 
and services such as sophisticated switching and transmission 
equipment but is no longer competitive in lowend equipment 
such as residential telephones 
the report blamed part of the deficit on barriers to foreign 
markets the availability of lowcost capital overseas and export 
support given foreign companies by their governments 
but the study also cited a troubling trend in which the 
united states was lagging behind some other industrialized nations 
in worker education and training a recent survey by the national 
alliance of business found that some us companies must interview 
seven or eight applicants on average to find one acceptable 
employee 
the study also said us companies keep their eyes trained too 
much on the bottom line instead of making longterm investments in 
research and development and in improving manufacturing processes 
and technologies 
us industry can remain the world leader by taking a 
longterm view emphasizing rampd spending and improvements in 
manufacturing technology and keeping up pressure on export 
markets commerce secretary robert mosbacher said in a prepared 
statement the us government will do its part by aggressively 
pursuing measures to open markets in countries that erect unfair 
barriers 
undersecretary michael farren said it was an absolute 
necessity that longterm thinking ply a larger role at us 
corporations 
undersecretary janice obuchowski said shortterm profit is the 
top priority for us telecommunications companies whereas in 
japan the primary goal is to increase world market share 
she said that the united states still leads the world in worker 
productivity but that japan and britain are gaining

russian leader boris n yeltsin said thursday he 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are interrupting their 
summer trips and returning to moscow to salvage their emergency 
plan for rescuing the soviet economy 
yeltsin president of the vast russian republic on wednesday 
broke off his threeweek tour of the republic to join in drafting 
the economic program according to the official tass news agency 
yeltsin also told tass that gorbachev was returning to moscow 
from the southern crimea where he had been expected to vacation 
for a month 
yeltsin said tuesday a conflict had developed within the 
12member commission that he and gorbachev appointed earlier this 
month to develop a joint blueprint for moving toward a market 
economy the russian president did not specify what issue was in 
dispute 
after meeting with commission members thursday yeltsin said the 
members were having trouble getting information from the soviet 
finance and defense ministries which control vital sectors of the 
economy but he said without elaborating that they agreed on 
measures to avoid chaos during the changeover from a command 
economy to a marketoriented system that both men envision 
yeltsin also accused soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov of 
duplicating the commissions work by developing a parallel economic 
plan 
it is necessary to concentrate on our program which is 
trusted by the people and is both novel and realistic tass 
quoted yeltsin as saying 
yeltsin said if both plans are presented to the national 
parliament for approval in september russia will adopt its own 
plan and the issue will be closed 
gorbachev has ordered all national government agencies to 
cooperate with the highlevel economy commission 
however yeltsin complained that the commission has not even 
obtained a breakdown of the current soviet budget and blamed 
bureaucratic obstacles on either a lack of desire or sabotage 
according to the interfax news agency of radio moscow 
members of the commission include gorbachevs top economic 
adviser nikolai y petrakov a strong proponent of market reforms 
deputy prime minister leonid a abalkin presidential council 
member stanislav shatalin and officials of the russian republic 
yeltsin said the economic package could be implemented by oct 
1 he said its top priority would be to stabilize the economy to 
improve the circulation of money it would strengthen the ruble by 
jan 1 
the economy is unable to provide enough housing food or basic 
consumer goods for the soviet people and economists blame part of 
the problem on an excess supply of rubles and inefficient 
production and distribution 
yeltsin said gorbachev has been in daily telephone contact with 
the commission since beginning his vacation in early august 
as far as i know gorbachev decided to cut short his 
vacation in order to come here and personally supervise the work 
yeltsin told reporters 
it was not known when gorbachev would return to the capital 
yeltsin on aug 6 began a tour of russia which encompasses 
threequarters of the soviet land mass and half its population he 
is scheduled to go back on the road to novokuznetsk on friday 
during his meetings in local communities yeltsin has suggested 
russia will borrow 7 billion to 10 billion from the west to ease 
food shortages and promised that all businesses in the republic 
will be free to run their own affairs beginning jan 1 
he said russia will study national construction and development 
programs including space and stop financing those which are 
unprofitable he also pledged to contribute only 36 billion to the 
national budget compared with 112 billion in past years he also 
said he will press for a 15 percent cut in national defense 
spending 
russia already has claimed sovereignty over its natural 
resources and last week yeltsin declared invalid all contracts 
signed by the central government to sell those resources that 
includes a 5 billion deal to sell russias diamonds to the de 
beers diamond syndicate 
on wednesday he said russia would set a maximum income tax of 
38 percent and that it would be lower for entrepreneurs who 
stimulated the economy by creating jobs 
yeltsin was elected president in june and quit the communist 
party in july saying he wanted to devote more time to his new 
duties

reactors which give off radioactive waste that could be used in 
the manufacture of such arms 
the declaration thus appeared to have a mostly symbolic 
character although experts at the international atomic energy 
agency said albania possibly had several research reactors at 
universities producing sufficient waste to produce some weapons 
the decision announced by albanias state ata news agency was 
the latest sign that the small balkan country was determined to 
move away from its isolationist reputation and be party to 
international treaties and conventions albania would be the 141st 
country to accept the nonproliferation treaty 
diplomatic ties with moscow were reestablished last month after 
a nearly three decade hiatus occasioned by ideological differences 
albania also has served notice it wants to renew ties with 
washington 
moves to increase relations with foreign countries have been 
accompanied by internal reforms that have loosened the communist 
partys omnipresent grip but the communist leadership has served 
notice it will not permit democracy of the kind that has 
transformed the rest of east europe 
the government announced july 31 that it would allow the 
formation of joint ventures and other forms of foreign 
participation in the economy and decreed limited freedoms to stage 
public demonstrations 
those moves appeared designed to ease economic backwardness and 
provide a safety valve for a restive population dissatisfied with a 
low living standard and lack of personal freedoms 
in recent weeks albanian citizens demanding change forced their 
way into foreign embassies in tirana and were allowed to leave the 
country

think 
the calls filled with heavy breathing and unwholesome 
suggestions came from different people and the police determined 
that the calls were coming from all over the place 
the calls kept coming for three weeks around the clock 
youd get heavy breathing on one line then when you answered 
the other line on callwaiting why there was heavy breathing 
on that line too said farrell 23 
then one day a caller was unusually violent and angry 
he wanted someone to talk dirty to him farrell said he 
asked what kind of an operation was this 
it turned out the dirty talkers simply had the wrong number 
the man said he got the number the last four digits of which 
spelled girl from an ad in a local weekly newspaper 
the ad read in part share the fantasy creative sensuous 
fulfilling major credit cards and offered a phone number 
but many callers didnt see the 1800 in small type and only 
dialed the last seven digits farrells number 
the ad was changed this week after the company and the newspaper 
were told of the problem 
and now farrell knows an easy way to help people remember her 
number

san salvador el salvador guerrilla attacks have blacked out 
45 percent of el salvador on the eve of renewed peace talks between 
the rightwing government and its leftist foes utility officials 
reported thursday 
representatives of the government of president alfredo cristiani 
and the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front are to meet 
friday in costa rica for a fourth round of talks aimed at a 
possible september ceasefire 
but officials of the stateowned rio lempa executive commission 
said guerrilla attacks on 17 main electric transmission lines in 
recent days have knocked out power to nearly half this small 
central american nation of 5 million people with all 14 provinces 
affected 
a commission official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said repairs have not been carried out because the 
terrorists have mined the vicinity of the 17 demolished towers and 
workers lives would be endangered 
demolitions experts of the rebel front known as the fmln 
dynamited two electricity stations in the capital wednesday night 
complicating repair tasks commission officials said 
power in the capital is rationed to five hours per zone daily 
the armed forces said rebels harassed national guard positions 
in jucuapa about 70 miles east of the capital on thursday but 
reported no casualties 
the army reported that during nine years of war it killed 20463 
guerrillas while losing 7118 soldiers it said 4955 civilians 
also were killed 
joaquin caceres of the nongovernment human rights commission 
reported that since the war intensified following an oct 15 1979 
coup el salvador suffered about 73000 civilians killed and 7500 
missing 
he said the army figures try to obscure the grave violations 
of human rights which have occurred in these years of war 
especially with the military bombing of rural zones 
the peace talks in san jose costa ricas capital were expected 
to focus on rebel demands that the size of the armed forces 
estimated at 54000 men be reduced and that officers guilty of 
severe human rights violations be purged 
schafik handal of the rebel general command has said that the 
impunity purification and reduction of the armed forces are 
indispensable themes of discussion to advance the negotiations to 
put an end to the war 
oscar santamaria the chief government delegate said a 
ceasefire should come first 
the two sides agreed at last months sessions in costa rica to 
accept un supervision of human rights following any ceasefire 
accord 
they agreed in geneva in december 1989 to hold periodic meetings 
under united nations supervision the first rounds were in 
venezuela and mexico 
last may both sides agreed in caracas to sign a ceasefire 
agreement by sept 15

the united states reiterated thursday that it is 
keeping its options open in case of a chemical attack by iraq 
including retaliation with its own chemical weapons 
us chief delegate stephen j ledogar was referring to earlier 
washington warnings when he spoke at the 40nation geneva 
conference on disarmament at which iraq has observer status 
the united states has simply said that if we are attacked with 
chemical weapons we must have a variety of response options 
including the option to respond in kind so long as we still have 
some chemical weapons he said 
we earnestly wish that such precautions were unnecessary he 
added but as the sad developments of the last two weeks show all 
too clearly setting a good example is not enough 
the united states and other powers pledged in an international 
pact during the 1970s not to be the first to use chemical weapons 
the use of chemical weapons in war was banned under the geneva 
conventions after world war i 
iraq acknowledged using the weapons during the 198088 iraniraq 
war 
ledogars address came as the summer session of the geneva 
conference was drawing to a close discussions focused on the 
projected treaty to ban production stockpiling and usage of 
chemical weapons worldwide 
he said arguments and procedural challenges during the session 
which ends aug 24 indicated that we have reached the inevitable 
phase in our work when the tough questions are on the table 
soviet chief delegate sergey batsanov told the conference 
earlier that moscow was concerned because of what he said was a 
lack of progress in finding answers to the key political issues 
involved he announced support for a french proposal to convene a 
ministerial meeting in january to help complete the proposed treaty 
sometimes we resort to a kind of diplomatic minuet when 
outdated positions are being reintroduced by those who in the past 
convincingly criticized them batsanov said without naming any 
country 
he said political solutions were required for a set of problems 
dealing especially with measures to prevent violations of the 
treaty and moves to ensure compliance worldwide 
methods of verification or ensuring compliance have been main 
hurdles in the talks which date to 1968 but progress on this and 
other issues had prompted optimistic forecasts that final agreement 
was within reach on what diplomats agree will be the most 
complicated disarmament measure in history

homicides are the leading cause of fatal 
onthejob injuries among american women according to a federal 
study released thursday 
if a womans going to die from an injury at work shes 
probably going to be murdered said catherine bell an 
epidemiologist with the national institute for occupational safety 
and health a division of the national centers for disease control 
fortytwo percent of workplace trauma deaths of women in the 
united states from 1980 to 1985 were homicides the cdc reported 
jobrelated motor vehicle accidents were second at around 39 
percent 
by comparison homicides accounted for 12 percent of mens 
occupational fatalities for both sexes nationwide about 13 
percent of onthejob trauma deaths during 198085 were homicides 
the cdc reported 
health institute investigators identified 950 female 
occupational homicides over the sixyear period of that number 
389 or 41 percent worked in the retail field 
although research is not complete it seems that strangers in 
the store not coworkers are responsible for most workplace 
killings of women ms bell said 
they appear to be robberyassociated crimes in the retail 
trade she said 
the killings peaked from december to march sixtyfour percent 
of the killings were committed with guns 19 percent were 
stabbings the workplace homicide rate for black women was nearly 
double that for white women 
the cdc did not release figures for causes of workplace trauma 
deaths among women other than homicides and vehicular accidents 
the reports findings suggest public health professionals need 
to devise ways to reduce womens risk in the workplace ms bell 
said 
there are ways to prevent these homicides she said 
safety precautions such as better lighting safer cashhandling 
and even bulletproof barricades should be considered the federal 
agency said 
comparable findings regarding killings of men in the workplace 
are not complete ms bell said 
but most onthejob deaths involve male workers who 
traditionally dominate more dangerous occupations most of the male 
workplace deaths are accidental

major industries are covering up lack of real 
progress in pollution control through phantom reductions in 
toxic emissions the national wildlife federation said thursday 
the claims were rejected by alcoa chairman and chief executive 
officer paul h oneill who appeared at the conservation 
organizations news conference and accused the federation of 
malicious deliberate misrepresentation of the facts 
the federation in a 136page report entitled phantom 
reductions named alcoa as a prime example of a company using 
creative accounting to reduce emissions of chemicals on an 
environmental protection agency toxic inventory list 
an epa official said the agency also had cited estimating and 
reporting methods as reasons for reported decreases in chemical 
emissions 
the national wildlife federation report analyzed the 1987 and 
1988 pollution control records of 29 companies identified by the 
national wildlife federation as major sources of toxic emissions 
the 29 accounted for nearly 23 percent of 104 billion pounds of 
toxic emissions reported under the epa toxics release inventory for 
1987 
it said that while these companies reported a 39 percent 
reduction in emissions the real decline when paper decreases 
were discounted was only 67 percent 
federation president jay d hair said alcoa the nations 
largest aluminum producer reduced its reported emissions in three 
texas and arkansas plants by 763 million pounds by merely 
reclassifying the substances being released into the environment 
alcoa said it discovered less aluminum oxide a chemical then on 
epas toxic inventory list in its emissions instead the 
federation claimed the aluminum manufacturer added more aluminum 
hydroxide which is not on the epa list 
nonfibrous aluminum oxide which accounts for 95 percent of the 
aluminum industrys aluminum oxide emissions was taken off the epa 
list in february this year alcoas oneill in a heated exchange 
with hair said the federations report was a scurrilous attack 
on our integrity and im here to say we resent it 
hair acknowledged that a federation press release had failed to 
note that aluminum oxide was no longer on the toxic list but he 
responded the fact is that people are breathing 763 million 
pounds of aluminum oxide alcoa clean up your damned act 
the national wildlife federation report said also that kennecott 
utah copper had reduced its reported toxic emissions from 158 
million pounds in 1987 to only 125 million pounds in 1988 by 
redefining itself as a mining rather than manufacturing concern 
only the manufacturing sector is required to file toxic release 
inventory reports to the epa 
at best this is disingenuous hair said 
the federation said industries also reduced reported emissions 
by reclassifying recycled wastes it said pharmaceutical giant eli 
lillys plant in clinton indiana cut emissions of such toxics as 
methanol and toluene from 16 million pounds in 1987 to 43 million 
pounds in 1988 mainly by not reporting wastes transferred to 
another company for recycling 
eli lilly spokesman edward west said the motives of the 
national wildlife federation are great but their interpretation of 
the data is wrong 
he said the clinton plant will spend 34 million this year to 
purchase and operate pollution control systems and that rather 
than attacking companies the nwf should be encouraging recycling 
the federation recommended closing the offsite recycling 
loophole improving epa monitoring of toxic emissions adding 
chemicals to the toxic list and making more industries accountable 
for their chemical wastes currently about 320 of the 60000 
chemicals used in the united states are included in the toxic 
releases inventory 
epa spokesman sean mcelheny agreed that changes in estimating 
methods and in the chemicals on the list were major factors in 
reported decreases in chemical emissions 
he said epa is working to expand the number of chemicals on the 
toxic list and make reporting mandatory for more industries

us and european space officials 
said thursday they were not worried about opposition to the launch 
of a plutoniumpowered satellite that would explore the suns poles 
the satellite would be carried aboard the space shuttle 
discovery tentatively scheduled to be launched in early october 
antinuclear and peace groups fear an explosion at the launch 
pad or in the air could scatter deadly radioactivity over florida 
protests are planned closer to the launch date 
theyre entitled to their viewpoint i happen to think theyre 
wrong said derek eaton the european space agencys project 
manager for the satellite known as ulysses 
reports predicting devastation in the event of an accident are 
scaremongering eaton said nasa officials have said the 
chances of a disaster are extremely small 
this protest happens in every country in the world you just 
have to live with that sort of thing eaton said at a press 
briefing i dont feel offended i dont feel disgusted i dont 
feel amused its a point of view i dont happen to share 
ulysses scientific instruments would be powered by one 
radioisotope thermoelectric generator or rtg which converts heat 
from decaying plutonium into electricity the generators have been 
used without mishap on 23 space missions many of them planetary 
probes during the past few decades said willis meeks ulysses 
project manager for nasa 
it would be the second time an rtg has flown on the shuttle 
last october two such generators were aboard the galileo 
spacecraft that was sent by the shuttle atlantis on a sixyear 
journey to jupiter 
opponents want the ulysses mission postponed until solar panels 
can be installed as a power source 
however such a redesign would likely kill the program said 
edward smith ulysses project scientist the united states does not 
have a big enough launch vehicle to fly a satellite with the 
enormous solar panels that would be required officials said 
white house approval of discoverys launch with ulysses is 
expected by midseptember such clearance is necessary when rtgs 
are used 
nasa wants to launch the discovery oct 5 the space agency has 
until oct 23 to get the shuttle off the ground during the correct 
alignment of earth the sun and jupiter whose gravitational field 
will slingshot ulysses back to the sun 
if discovery fails to lift off by then the mission must be 
delayed 13 months 
the 750 million ulysses mission will span five years the 
spacecraft would be the first to orbit over the suns poles 
providing important information about the interaction between the 
sun and earth 
nasas share of the mission is an estimated 500 million the 
european space agency paid for the 250 million cost of the 
spacecraft

the boeing co has agreed to pay more than 
500000 to a worker who claimed his leukemia was caused by 
exposure to radiation during company tests the mans lawyers said 
robert strom alleged the aerospace company used him to test the 
effects of electromagnetic pulse radiation a blast of electrical 
energy created during a nuclear explosion 
under the settlement boeing and a codefendant lovelace 
biomedical and environmental research institute also will pay 
another 200000 to support up to 10 years of medical examinations 
for more than 700 other boeing workers who joined in stroms 
classaction lawsuit stroms attorney michael withey said 
wednesday 
strom was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1985 
and he blamed the illness on what he said was chronic exposure to 
emp from 1983 to 1985 
in his 1988 lawsuit strom alleged boeing used him as a guinea 
pig to test the effects of the radiation 
strom an electronics technician who worked on emp tests at 
boeing also alleged in his suit that boeing didnt tell him and 
other workers of potential health hazards of working with the 
health hazards of working with the radiation even though it knew 
there was a potential danger the suit later was expanded to 
include other present and former boeing workers 
boeing has said it tested the effects of emp on electronics in 
military aircraft and communications equipment it has denied using 
strom or anyone else as a human research subject 
medical authorities disagree on whether electromagnetic 
radiation can cause cancer or other health problems and what level 
of exposure might pose a risk electromagnetic fields are given off 
by many electric devices including power lines transformers 
video screens and home appliances but at far lower levels than the 
pulses from nuclear explosions 
the state board of industrial insurance appeals in 1988 denied 
stroms claim that his leukemia was caused by the testing 
the lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial this week but the 
settlement was tentatively approved wednesday morning by king 
county superior court judge mary wicks brucker withey said 
under the settlement boeing admitted no liability and none of 
the allegations in the lawsuit 
the settlement will spare the stroms and boeing from what 
would be a great expense in both time and money said boeing 
spokesman russ young 
im very pleased at this incredible victory said strom who 
continues to work at boeing but on commercial aircraft 
he said his leukemia worsened about a year and a half ago but 
ive outlived the prognosis of my doctors 
brucker is to hear any objections to the settlement and decide 
whether to give it final approval at a sept 21 hearing

robert mapplethorpes sexually explicit 
photographs have drawn the scrutiny of the federal communications 
commission which is investigating complaints against a public 
television station that aired some of the pictures 
boston station wgbhtv included the photos in a 10 pm newscast 
july 31 during a segment about mapplethorpes work which went on 
exhibit at the institute of contemporary art the next day 
the exhibit has generated heated debate since last year when 
sen jesse helms rnc attacked it prompting congress to limit 
federal grants to art deemed obscene 
the director of a cincinnati art gallery that exhibited the 
photographs is being tried for pandering obscenity a few of the 
photographs depict naked children or homoerotic sex 
at least three people have complained to the fcc since wgbh 
showed some of the photographs among them was donald wildmon head 
of the american family association in tupelo miss who sent a 
videotape of the broadcast to the fcc 
a letter from wildmon described the broadcast as nothing more 
than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material 
eric brass attorney for wgbh defended the stations decision 
it just is not obscene brass said thursday i believe we 
have the right to do what we did in the context of a serious news 
program we cannot be in the position of censoring debate about 
censorship thats what it would come down to 
the fcc has not decided what action if any should be taken 
said roger holberg an fcc attorney 
if material is judged to be obscene it can be banned entirely 
from being broadcast holberg said but material deemed to be 
indecent is given more leeway 
under its current rules the fcc prohibits indecent material 
from appearing on the airwaves prior to 8 pm attempting to put 
it beyond the reach of unsupervised children holberg said 
but last year the fcc citing evidence that children often watch 
late television adopted a rule that would let the agency restrict 
the broadcast of indecent material 24 hours a day that rule was 
challenged by broadcasters and other groups and the us court of 
appeals in washington is weighing whether it can be enforced 
the fcc defines indecency as materials that portray sexual or 
excretory activities or organs in terms patently offensive as 
measured by contemporary community standards holberg said 
officials at the television station said the photographs were 
included in the broadcast because they were at the center of the 
news 
we wanted to let the public know what the controversy was 
about and let them decide for themselves said station 
spokeswoman julie eggleston

the sheriffs of four counties in the 
eastern kentucky hills were arrested thursday on charges they took 
money to provide protection for drug traffickers passing cocaine 
through the state 
the fbi set up the sting operation last year with two agents 
acting as chicago businessmen interested in shipping cocaine 
at one point cocaine packages were airdropped onto a farm owned 
by one of the officers authorities said 
what this particular situation does reflect is the absolute 
corrupting influence of drugs said us attorney louie 
defalaise as far as law enforcement officials this is the 
largest case that we can recall 
the sheriffs and two other officers were charged in a 42count 
indictment that accused them of conspiracy drug distribution and 
protecting other drug traffickers 
forty fbi agents fanned out through the contiguous counties of 
breathitt lee owsley and wolfe to make the arrests thursday 
detained were lee county sheriff johnny mann 39 breathitt 
county sheriff dean spencer 46 wolfe county sheriff lester drake 
51 and owsley county sheriff billy mcintosh 57 
also arrested were beattyville police chief omer noe and wolfe 
county deputy wilson stone 
at a hearing before a federal magistrate thursday five of the 
men were released on bond mann was denied bond after an undercover 
agent testified he had promised during the yearlong sting to kill 
anyone who set him up 
terry oconnor agent in charge of the fbi in kentucky said 
there was no entrapment in the sting operation 
it was more than a tip it was pretty sound information 
oconnor said he would provide no other information 
the sting was codenamed walking short a movie a few years 
ago titled walking tall related the exploits of a rural sheriff 
who did not cave in to corruption all around him 
according to the indictment agents first met with mann in lee 
county who introduced them to the other local law officers 
from august 1989 to this month the agents made payments to the 
officers totaling more than 85000 the money was in exchange for 
protecting the agents fake cocaine and marijuana smuggling and 
distribution business from police detection and other interference 
the indictment said 
a release said official vehicles of the county sheriffs were 
used during the drug transactions fbi agents were seen pulling a 
pile of 100 bills from an owsley county vehicle 
defalaise said the cocaine which totaled 112 kilograms or 
almost 250 pounds was never distributed for sale to the public 
the narcotics never passed out of our hands basically 
defalaise said 
the initial conspiracy and extortion counts carry a maximum 
penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a 250000 fine or both the 
drug counts carry a minimum prison term of 10 years to life and a 
fine of 4 million a separate marijuana sale charge against mann 
carries a sentence of five years and a fine of 250000 
mann was named in 19 counts drake 17 mcintosh 14 noe 13

the forces include ground troops and amphibious units from

anonymity 
separately gen john dailey the assistant commandant of the 
marine corps said the service is sending a substantial armada

declined to estimate a number 
he said the marines would provide significant combat 
capability in defense of saudi arabia and would be ready for a 
prolonged stay 
we dont just arrive the fourstar general said in an 
interview were there to stay for a fairly lengthy period 
president bush speaking with reporters at his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine said some consideration was being given 
to calling up military reserve units to back up troops being sent 
to the middle east 
he said the reserves were ready to serve but no decision has 
been made in that regard 
the marine buildup is just one part of what has become an 
enormous movement of sea air and ground forces to the mideast 
president bush and the nations military leaders have kept secret 
the exact number of us troops responding to the twoweek old 
persian gulf crisis but officials have prepared contingency plans 
to put 250000 soldiers on the ground if necessary 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said thursday that iraq has 
continued to increase its armed forces in kuwait he said 
intelligence estimates now put the number at 160000 
he said there has been no major change in the character of the 
iraqi forces which the pentagon earlier described as having a 
defensive appearance 
theres a continuing flow in and out of kuwait he said 
as for the marine buildup pentagon sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said units are being pulled together from 
around the globe including bases on both us coasts hawaii and 
okinawa 
in the main components the sources said 
marine combat forces from bases at camp pendleton el toro and 
twentynine palms calif are being flown to saudi arabia 
elements of marine units from norfolk va as well as camp 
lejeune cherry point and new river in north carolina will become 
part of a 13ship amphibious assault task force that will be 
leaving within days 
a third brigade is on alert and preparing to join the other 
two for a total force that is expected to number around 45000 men 
if all units are deployed 
the third unit also composed of amphibious forces will remain 
floating off the coastal waters of saudi arabia ready to land 
and project power anywhere on the peninsula the sources said 
the forces will be bolstered by some 100 m60a1 heavy tanks 
more than 150 ground attack jets armed with aim7 sparrow and aim9 
sidewinder missiles and an array of troop transports attack 
helicopters and light armored vehicles armed with 25 mm canons 
all units arrive with the fuel ammunition and waterpurifying 
capabilities that will allow them to fight and sustain combat for 
30 days 
gen dailey in an interview thursday said the marine corps is 
particularly suited to dealing with the saudi crisis since its men 
can move with speed to an area with a formidable combat 
capability and yet remain off shore if necessary it gives us 
the opportunity to do nothing to use nonprovocative means if 
a crisis subsides dailey said 
the deployment to the middle east which has put marines on the 
ground in saudi arabia within six days of receiving their first 
alert shows the worth of prepositioning equipment and supplies 
at strategic points around the globe dailey said 
such supplies are stored at the us base at diego garcia in the 
indian ocean on guam and on the east coast of the united states 
the marine forces in saudi arabia will be under the command of 
gen walter boomer the threestar commander of the marine 
expeditionary force at camp pendleton 
at camp lejeune nc the commanding general in charge of 
marines on the east coast said some 17000 marines are being moved 
to the middle east 
in vietnam we phased forces in more gradually this is 
assertive said lt gen carl mundy commanding general of fleet 
marine force atlantic 
the barn doors are open and all the marine corps spigots are 
wide open mundy said adding that the movement would last until 
next week 
the number of marines being readied for deployment to the 
mideast amounts to a substantial segment of the 197000strong 
force even though a marine amphibious readiness group is helping 
conduct the evacuation operation off the west coast of africa due 
to the civil war in liberia dailey said the service isnt stressed 
and sees no need to call up reservists 
marines train in a desert environment at twentynine palms the 
general said but he fully expected his soldiers to find the saudi 
environment extremely harsh its possible there will be 
casualties without a shot being fired just because of the 
searing heat of the environment he said 
meanwhile the pentagon announced that elements of the armys 
3rd armored cavalry regiment from fort bliss texas had begun 
deploying thursday for the middle east 
as well us air force a10 thunderbolt ii tankkiller 
attack jets from myrtle beach air force base sc have left for 
saudi arabia the announcement said

transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
thursday that civilian airlines stand ready to give up commercial 
flights to ferry soldiers to the middle east but he is optimistic 
that it wont be necessary 
skinner also said that the governments reserve of merchant 
ships with civilian crews is being prepared to supply growing us 
military operations following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
if it means they have to cancel flights and divert aircraft 
they will do so skinner said after meeting individually with 
several airline presidents wednesday and thursday he had called 
the carrier executives in to discuss the impact of increasing jet 
fuel prices on the industry and its passengers 
skinner speaking to reporters in his office praised airlines 
for supplying hired charters that have already carried some troops 
he declined to say how many airlines had been involved 
several airlines contacted on wednesday said there had been no 
disruption of normal flights but that the military had notified 
them to be prepared to activate the civil reserve air fleet if 
necessary the fleet is made up of several passenger jets 
designated for use by the military in times of crisis 
on the fuel issue skinner said industry leaders told him they 
anticipate a financial crunch because of rising fuel prices and 
fares will have to go up 
he said there is no evidence of price gouging in efforts by the 
airlines to increase prices but market demand has forced many of 
them to scale back initial plans for increases 
several airlines had announced 10 percent hikes to take effect 
this week but most have scaled back to 53 percent and some are 
offering even lower fares than those in effect before the gulf 
crisis skinner said this reflects public resistance to the 
increases rather than any pressure from the government to roll back 
ticket prices 
the transportation secretary said several ships were being 
prepared from the seagoing ready reserve fleet which is a supply 
of 96 merchant vessels mothballed by the military at several ports 
for emergency use 
the ships are surplus civilian vessels purchased by the 
military each is supposed to be maintained so it can be ready for 
use in 510 days 
skinner acknowledged some difficulty in recruiting crews for the 
vessels but said this was being worked out with maritime union 
officials 
this is the biggest test of the ready reserve fleet we have 
ever had and it seems to be working fairly well skinner said 
skinner said he was forming a task force of airline industry 
union and government officials to look into ways the aviation 
industry can save on fuel costs 
he said airline stockholders are likely to end up absorbing 
about half of the increased cost and that some financially troubled 
carriers face a serious challenge 
this could take them from a modest profit year to a very 
modest or loss year industrywide skinner said 
the secretary said he met with officials of united trans world 
northwest pan american and delta airlines and talked by phone with 
officials of some other carriers

here is the text of the news 
conference thursday with president bush and secretary of stated 
james a baker iii 
bush well weve had some good meetings here today two good 
meetings one with king hussein of jordan the other with the 
foreign minister his highness prince saud of saudi arabia in 
addition i was on the phone earlier to president ozal of turkey 
he reported in on some conversations hes had and i must say was 
somewhat optimistic about the effectiveness of these international 
sanctions in which most countries around the world have joined and 
so its been a very illuminating day 
i of course was very pleased that king hussein who previously 
had announced his support for sanctions his willingness to go with 
sanctions reiterated that to me making clear that this was a 
decision that jordan had taken some time ago but nevertheless i 
put this under the heading of very encouraging encouraging 
developments and in terms of the saudis i prince saud very kindly 
thanked me for the strong support from the united states and i told 
him that we were determined and wanted to do everything in our 
power to enforce the united nations resolution which calls for iraq 
to get out of kuwait and the calls for the restoration of the 
rulers to kuwait 
so were in sync with the saudis i feel that the differences 
that possibly existed with jordan have been narrowed and i cited 
one extremely important point there but i was pleased to see them 
both here at our home 
ill be glad to take some questions yeah terry and then jeff 
q mr president what kind of report did king hussein give you 
on his trip to baghdad and did he offer any kind of hope that 
saddam hussein would pull his troops out of kuwait and let the emir 
return to power 
bush i got he didnt go into any details of his trip to 
baghdad and i did not come away from that conversation with a 
feeling of hope that saddam hussein would do that which hes been 
called upon to do by international under international law 
q mr president what can you tell us about reports or what do 
you know about reports that foreign nationals in both iraq and 
kuwait have been ordered segregated and been reported to report to 
one place including some 2500 americans are you concerned that 
their lives may be in danger at this point 
bush im concerned that any coercion on foreign nationals in 
some other country is a violation of international norms and i must 
say that i did see a report weve discussed it they checked with 
one of the hotels to which people were encouraged to go and the 
hotel had no knowledge of an influx of people coming there so its 
a little vague right now jim but anything that compels 
individuals to do something against their will would of course 
concern me and i dont want to overstate it because we continue 
to get statements out of these various representatives of iraq the 
ambassador to the un for example that these people will all 
countries will be permitted free passage or will not be harassed 
but i saw the report and thus i must say i was concerned yeah 
anne 
q following up on that the americans who are in baghdad i 
believe are the ones who were taken from kuwait and today the 
american embassy personnel were for the first time not allowed to 
go in and see them and newspeople were thrown out isnt it getting 
more dangerous for those americans and would there be anything 
bush it gets more dangerous i think if i heighten the concern 
that ive already expressed and i said that the other day and ill 
repeat it here on the other hand when you get reports of this 
nature of course youre concerned about them 
q mr president what may i ask your reaction to the rather 
bellicose speech we heard today from saddam hussein in which as 
you probably know he called you a liar and vowed to send americans 
home in body bags 
bush well i really havent seen the speech ive seen some 
excerpts or the open letter i think it was and i think its clear 
that what we need to do at this point is to enforce the 
international law the statements at the united nations from many 
countries really say it all and so theres no point in me 
responding to the letter i didnt see any or nobodys at least 
presented so far to me from that letter any concrete proposals to 
which i feel a necessity to respond yeah 
q mr president what is the situation on the ground in iraq 
and kuwait whats going on with the sanctions how are they 
working today compared to how they were working two days ago say 
bush the sanctions against iraq in kuwait i get the feeling 
that the sanctions just put into effect and just being put into 
effect are beginning to take hold and i would cite a very upbeat 
statement from president ozal of turkey in this regard and so 
there doesnt appear to be any shipments of oil coming out of iraq 
and that is very positive because i think 90 percent of their 
foreign exchange looking for help here is based on petroleum and 
so id say that is a very encouraging step and the other part of 
it has to be arms being interdicted and everything all across the 
board foodstuffs whatever it is they have been penalized by the 
united nations chapter vii is seldom used but it has been used 
now to call these people to bring these people to do whats 
right and im i must say im encouraged with this concept of the 
world staying together and making these sanctions fully effective 
so 
q is there evidence that theyre feeling it though 
bush i cant cite specific evidence there was one little 
tidbit that we saw saying that and again i probably shouldnt 
even go into the details of it at all but anyway it was a report 
that some of the bakers had been ordered to stop making 
confections confectionary goods whatever it is sweets and these 
things and concentrate on the fundamentals the staples 
but i think theres knowing that the economic situation in 
iraq i dont think one can sustain true international isolation 
for long especially when you depend on the outside world for a lot 
of your a lot of your goods yes ann 
q if you call up or sign the order calling up the reserves 
then is that something you think you may have to call upon 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP900816-0129 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
bush ive not signed up anything on that theres some 
consideration we have a ready reserve we have a reserve that 
ive been told by a couple of proponents of the reserves are very 
eager to do their part but no decision has been made in that regard 
yes 
q mr president your feeling now of the situation do you 
think the situation is stabilizing or do you think the united 
states and iraq are getting closer to war 
bush i dont know that i can choose between the two options 
but i do know that there is a determination on the part of so many 
countries to do something about redressing the grievances that i 
think its going to work but i cant say that its stabilized 
totally i hope that the american presence and the presence of arab 
forces and the presence of others many others in saudi arabia 
and in that those areas has lessened the risk of further 
adventure on the part of saddam hussein 
yeah 
q is saddam making the king hussein of jordan in any way a 
gobetween between the united states and iraq 
bush i didnt get the feeling i read some reports and now im 
wondering where they all came from because id read some previous 
reports indicating that a man was coming with a letter from saddam 
hussein some maybe printed it here which id find hard to 
believe without any evidence and so i wondering where all this is 
coming from and i think i addressed myself to that question at the 
press conference when was it yesterday or the day before 
where i said i didnt know of that and that i i and i have felt 
to myself and whether i said it is i think he might have 
mentioned to me if there was such a letter but back to your 
question there was no intermediary mission that i detected at all 
i think hed like to find some way to be helpful and he 
reiterated his interest of making everything in an arab context 
but i had an opportunity to tell him my views on the situation and 
to tell him that in spite of the differences that may have appeared 
to be grievous a few a week or so ago that on the part of this 
president and i think of the united states entirely wed like to 
see better relations and i do think that his express willingness 
again expressed before he came here and then reiterated to go 
forward on these international sanctions is something that will be 
widely appreciated here in the united states and indeed around 
the world 
yeah 
q mr president did king hussein give you assurances that 
jordan would not allow iraqi goods in and out of the port of aqaba 
bush yes jim 
q mr president iraq made some pretty significant peace 
overtures to iran were you surprised by that what do you know by 
it how do you think itll affect the overall equation there are 
you concerned by it 
bush no im not concerned at all by it and im surprised only 
in the fact that it seems to be acquiescing to all of irans terms 
something that saddam hussein has been unwilling to accept not 
all totally all of them but i dont know the effect of it and 
i do know that iran has expressed their indignation about the 
takeover to of kuwait by iraq and i see nothing that has changed 
that i dont know of any statement that leads me to be concerned 
that theyre going to reverse their position on that point 
q youre not concerned that iran may throw in with iraq or 
what does it tell you about saddam husseins position right now 
bush well im not concerned about the former and i would 
simply let the facts and the evolution of events answer this the 
last part because you see i dont know that theres been an 
agreement on all these points i dont think there has that i know 
of i dont think its been fully finally agreed has it 
yeah terry 
q in view of that dont you think hes desperate sir 
bush well thats what you think im id rather just not 
speculate on that and just keep my eye on the ball which is to 
isolate in conjunction with others to isolate iraq 
q back to king hussein mr president you said that he agreed 
to cut off shipments to iraq through the port of aqaba but he told 
us that hes exploring with the united nations what the sanctions 
mean did he tell you that everything would be cut off including 
food 
bush let me ask jim because i think he let me ask the 
secretary lawyer fine lawyer that he is in addition to being a 
good secretary of state to answer that because he was the one 
that engaged the king in that particular discussion 
baker yeah i think what the king meant was that there is a 
provision in the sanctions that permits food for humanitarian 
purposes or some such language and theres really been no 
definition of exactly when that triggers and what that means and 
the government of jordan is seeking some guidance from the united 
nations on the subject 
q is that a loophole 
baker no its not a loophole its the way the sanctions were 
written by the united nations when they voted 13 to nothing to 
impose them 
bush last one 
q are you satisfied that goods will no longer go through jordan 
to iraq are you 
bush im not satisfied to total satisfaction on any point 
regarding the sanctions im very encouraged that they look like 
theyll be effective weve got to guard against cheaters youve 
got to guard against people who for economic gain will try to 
violate these sanctions from whatever part of the world they come 
from whatever country they come from so i cant say i am 
satisfied but what i am is encouraged that jordan prior to the 
kings coming here took this position and i think that is 
something that is encouraging and i think it might send a message 
to some who have been around the world who need a little leadership 
in that regard 
thank you all very much i know you have a deadline its been a 
full day thank you

heart disease in this country could be reduced 
considerably if americans would just get some exercise the 
national centers for disease control said thursday 
for instance the cdc said more than 22000 deaths a year in 
new york state alone are attributable to a sedentary lifestyle and 
coronary heart disease 
earlier this summer the cdc released a 37state survey showing 
that 57 percent of those questioned didnt get as much as three 
20minute sessions of physical activity a week 
the agency then calculated for 11 different states the number 
of coronary heart disease deaths that could have been prevented 
with exercise the formula took into account deaths from heart 
disease in 1987 the percentage of people getting little or no 
exercise and the probability that sedentary people are 19 times 
as likely to die from coronary heart disease 
in addition to the 22000 in new york the cdc projected 12000 
preventable heart disease deaths in florida 10000 in ohio and 
5000 in missouri even tiny rhode island had more than 1100 heart 
disease deaths that could have been prevented with proper exercise 
the atlantabased cdc calculated 
not all states were included just those which have launched 
physical fitnessheart disease programs and such data projections 
must be interpreted with caution the cdc said 
but the estimated number of preventable coronary heart disease 
deaths calculated from these data are substantial the report 
said 
other states included in the cdc report were tennessee with 
about 4600 preventable deaths alabama 2900 south carolina 
2700 washington 2600 west virginia 2100 and maine 1200 
new yorks high ranking in the projections 40 percent of its 
heart disease deaths being deemed preventable was a result of its 
poor showing in the cdcs 37state exercise survey 
seventyfour percent of the new yorkers in that study said they 
didnt get three 20minute episodes of physical activity a week 
the worst in the nation 
the state of washington on the other hand was best in the 
country 45 percent of its people reported getting enough exercise 
to avoid the sedentary classification 
another leading cause of coronary heart disease is excessive 
serum cholesterol federal health officials say about 30 percent of 
americans between ages 20 and 74 have elevated serum cholesterol 
levels

the bush administrations call for oil 
exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge was condemned by 
environmental groups thursday while oil industry officials were 
hopeful the initiative would be renewed 
a spokesman for the us minerals management service said this 
week that when congress gets back from its break the interior 
department will push for approval to open the refuge to exploration 
were in total disagreement said david cline regional vice 
president for the national audubon society we feel its a 
quickfix approach to our future energy needs 
the big oil companies have long wanted to explore for oil on the 
15 millionacre coastal plain but congress decreed in 1980 that 
any decision to drill requires its prior consent 
now that people are having to pay higher prices at the gas 
pump theres a heightened awareness of the issue said interior 
department spokesman steven goldstein 
there are no serious fuelsupply shortages at this time but the 
iraqkuwait conflict and its effect on oil supplies underscores 
our vulnerability said paul laird a spokesman for bp 
exploration a major oil producer on alaskas north slope 
industry officials said they do not know whether there is oil on 
the plain but test results are promising 
this would give us access to what we consider the best onshore 
prospect in the united states said dave heatwole public affairs 
vice president for arco alaska 
because of lease sales geophysical work and other hurdles oil 
production would not begin until eight to 10 years after the 
opening of the fields heatwole said 
allen e smith alaska regional director for the wilderness 
society called the push by the bush administration 
opportunistic he said the middle east crisis should instead 
give rise to conservation and development of alternative energy 
resources 
the refuge is an ecological treasure worth preserving the way 
it is smith said 
the persian gulf crisis may also increase pressure on california 
officials to ease their opposition to offshore oil drilling 
environmentalists said 
im worried im very worried about this said bob hattoy 
the sierra clubs regional director in los angeles the polls 
that weve seen show that people are environmentalists until it 
comes to their cars 
in the days following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait oil 
companies were the among first to call for relaxing government 
restrictions on drilling 
they have been pushing hard for the opening of the 25 billion 
point arguello project a threeplatform development 10 miles off 
point conception and about 150 miles north of los angeles 
the project could tap a reserve of as much as 300 million 
barrels of oil and pump it out at a rate of 100000 barrels a day 
oil executives estimate 
completed in late 1987 the project has been blocked by 
wrangling over how the oil will be delivered either by pipeline 
as santa barbara county insists or by tanker as the oil companies 
want 
longtime drilling proponents such as us rep william e 
dannemeyer rcalif have used the middle east crisis to bolster 
their positions 
weve got men in this nations armed forces prepared to die on 
the sands of the middle east at a time when we say were not going 
to begin producing from a field with the reserves of point 
arguello said dannemeyer it gets to the point that it is 
absurd 
but most top state politicians including both gubernatorial 
candidates sen pete wilson a republican and former san 
francisco mayor dianne feinstein a democrat oppose further 
offshore drilling

iraq on thursday ordered the 2500 americans 
in occupied kuwait to assemble within two hours in a hotel in the 
capital for protection against unspecified threats the state 
department said 
hours after the deadline very few had complied a senior 
us official told the associated press 
president bush called the order a little vague right now 
he told reporters at his vacation retreat in maine that 
anything that compels indivduals to do something against their 
will would of course concerns me 
but the president added i dont want to overstate it 
the senior us official said in washington that iraqi military 
authorities had implied to ambassador nathaniel howell that 
they would go out and find any americans who did not comply 
with the order 
the state department meanwhile instructed joe wilson the 
deputy us ambassador in baghdad to protest to the iraqi foreign 
ministry a second us official said he called the iraqi military 
commander in kuwait merely a minion of president saddam 
husseins government 
the international hotel is opposite the us embassy in kuwait 
city the capital of the small persian gulf emirate seized by iraq 
two weeks ago 
the iraqis also have instructed all britons to assemble at a 
hotel in a move the british foreign office condemned as grave and 
sinister 
asked why president bush did not attempt to evacuate the 
americans with military transport planes as one member of congress 
immediately suggested the us official replied that iraq had 
constructed an air defense system around the city 
the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity declined 
to say whether the iraqis had deployed surfacetoair missiles that 
the soviet union had sold to baghdad in the past 
rep larry smith dfla said bush ought to tell iraq that he 
is sending a military air transport to kuwait now to pick up every 
american and if there is any trouble the president of the 
united states will consider it an act of war 
iraqs order that the americans move to the hotel was given to 
the ambassador about 10 am local time 3 am edt and appeared 
to raise the stakes in a war of nerves between bush and iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
bush had responded to iraqs invasion of kuwait by organizing an 
international embargo and pouring tens of thousands of troops into 
saudi arabia to protect the worlds richest oil fields 
saddam meanwhile closed the borders to 2 million to 3 million 
foreign nationals including the 2500 americans 
some 500 americans have managed to get out of kuwait but only 
three of them in the past few days the us embassy has urged 
americans not to risk trying 
another 530 or so americans are trapped in iraq 
they have not been mistreated in either country the state 
department said 
abc news reported from iraq that for the first day since their 
incarceration the us consul was not permitted in to see the 
americans detained at the rashid hotel in baghdad britain also was 
denied access to detainees it said 
howell protested the iraqi order as unjustified and impractical 
we believe that this action is totally uncalled for richard 
boucher a state department spokesman said most americans would 
be better off in their homes 
he said howell made clear that he could inform americans of 
the request but that he had no power to order them to move 
boucher added obviously the situation is of concern to us 
but he again declined to describe the trapped americans as hostages 
initially howell was told by the iraqi military authorities 
that the americans should go to central points such as hotels 
but then it became clear they meant the kuwaiti 
international boucher said we are not instructing them one 
way or another 
the spokesman said the americans in kuwait were bearing up well 
though in some instances were experiencing food shortages 
of course all would be better off all americans all 
foreigners if they were allowed to leave and we will continue to 
work toward that goal if americans wish to move to a hotel thats 
fine boucher said

an anticensorship group urged british movie 
censors thursday to lift their ban on international guerrillas 
a film that portrays the slaying of novelist salman rushdie 
article 19 which has steadfastly fought moslem demands for the 
suppression of rushdies novel the satanic verses called the 
ban an act of prior restraint which is an unacceptable form of 
censorship 
the british board of film classification banned the 
pakistanimade movie last month on the grounds it criminally libels 
rushdie the board is to hear an appeal friday against the ban 
in a statement article 19 said that if the film was libelous 
it should be screened in public and then fought over in the courts 
it noted rushdie has issued assurances that he would take no action 
british moslem groups have denounced the ban on the film as 
hypocrisy because the satanic verses which they say blasphemes 
islam was not suppressed 
the 3hour film portrays the rushdie character as a sadistic 
murderer who uses a long curved sword to slit the throats of three 
moslems the film ends with the villain being killed by divine 
lightning bolts 
rushdie has been in hiding since february 1989 when the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran ordered moslems to kill him

between rival black factions spread thursday into soweto where men 
with spears and axes rampaged through a train station hacking 
terrified passengers to death 
police and the african national congress agreed to hold a 
peace forum friday to try to halt the violence between zulus 
and xhosas that left at least 156 people dead in five days 
hundreds of zulus fell upon railway passengers witnesses said

neighboring dobsonville and johannesburg and more than 100 were 
injured at least 15 were critically hurt 
police said rock and bottlethrowing and sporadic gunfire 
continued until early friday 
after an emergency meeting in pretoria with president fw de 
klerk anc deputy president nelson mandela and other anc officials 
met late into the night with law and order minister adriaan vlok 
just before midnight they told a joint news conference at the 
main soweto police station that a peace forum representing police 
and leaders of all parties involved in the conflict would begin 
meeting friday to find the cause of the violence 
no immediate response came from leaders of the conservative 
zulubased inkatha party whose supporters have been fighting 
xhosaspeaking anc supporters in soweto and other townships around 
johannesburg

rightwingers police said no one was injured or arrested 
the black fighting had been concentrated in the eastern province 
of natal where more than 5000 black have died since 1985 
the recent spread of the conflict into johannesburg and other

in south africa many zulus involved in the fighting say they would 
not accept mandela and the anc as a future government

shakespeares richard iii is such a monster that 
it takes a truly dangerous actor to play him dangerous in the 
sense of not playing it safe 
an actor has to pull out all the stops even go a bit overboard 
to portray the evil genius who murders and connives his way to the 
throne after all this man has to convince a lot of people that he 
should be king 
but denzel washington holds back in the new production of 
richard iii which joseph papps new york shakespeare festival 
has on view in central park through sept 2 
washingtons tyrant is more mannered than monstrous he speaks 
in clipped phrases that rob the character of much of richards 
malicious persona the actor hesitates something that doesnt fit 
with the kings calculating histrionics the man should mesmerize 
be larger than life in this production he gets lost in the crowd 
even richards physical deformities have been lessened the 
hunchback is gone and the game leg more a limp than a major 
liability washington is an attractive easygoing performer which 
works against him in this role 
still the actor may grow in confidence as he continues to play 
the part and director robin phillips has surrounded washington 
with a generally fine cast and an intelligent straightforward 
production 
phillips presents nearly the entire play which is one of the 
longer works in the shakespeare canon he balances the pageantry 
and the intimate scenes well the best moments are the oneonone 
confrontations richards wooing of lady anne whose husband and 
fatherinlaw he has just murdered and his arguments with queen 
elizabeth after he has killed her two sons 
the other roles in the play are purely secondary but there are 
impressive cameos by mary alice as that onewoman chorus of doom 
queen margaret daniel davis as richards willing and eventually 
doomed coconspirator buckingham and sam tsoutsouvas as the 
dying king edward iv 
the setting by elis y lam is hightech allpurpose middle ages 
with towering arches and a movable backdrop of iron grating that 
conveniently serves as a prison when lowered into place 
lams costumes are sumptuous especially the dazzling dark blue 
cape bestowed on richard when he is finally crowned 
like all the history plays richard iii is about power 
specifically the misuse of power and how england overcame the 
rulers who misused power 
phillips comes up with a stunning tableau at the end of the 
play the dead richard lies downstage while the victorious henry 
earl of richmond who becomes henry vii is carried off in triumph 
by a cheering crowd 
its a fitting climax to shakespeares history plays that begin 
with richard ii and work their way through henry iv parts 
1 and 2 henry v and the three parts of henry vi now if 
only the richard of this production could match the monster that 
shakespeare put on stage

the persian gulf showdown between iraq and the united states 
took a more personal turn thursday when iraqs saddam hussein 
called president bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war 
could bring thousands of americans home in coffins 
bush commenting on the twoweekold gulf crisis from his 
vacation home in maine said he saw little reason to be optimistic 
about a settlement of the dispute which stems from iraqs invasion 
of oilwealthy kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the 
border of saudi arabia 
after a twohour meeting at his kennebunkport home with king 
hussein of jordan bush said i did not come away with any 
feeling of hope that iraq would withdraw its army from kuwait 
bush also said thursday that king hussein assured him jordan 
would close the last remaining free port to most iraqi trade as the 
economic embargo on materials to iraq continued unabated 
foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry iraq 
imports about threequarters of its food 
pentagon sources in washington meanwhile said the bush 
administration plans to deploy 45000 marines to the region to back 
up the thousands of army navy and air force troops already in 
place in the gulf and the saudi desert 
at a news conference secretary of state james a baker iii said 
jordan is seeking some guidance about a provision in the 
unbacked trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian 
purposes 
worries however grew about the safety of americans and other 
westerners trapped in kuwait iraqi military authorities ordered 
all americans and britons in kuwait to assemble at a hotel 
officials said 
very few of the 2500 americans in occupied kuwait complied 
with the order a senior us official told the associated press 
iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified 
threats british foreign office minister william waldegrave called 
the order grave and sinister 
what we fear is that they will be interned somewhere most 
likely in iraq waldegrave said 
a total of about 3000 americans 3000 britons and more than 
450 japanese are in iraq and kuwait overall more than 2 million 
foreigners are in both countries iraq has called them 
restrictees 
in addition to the estimated 45000 marines to ultimately be 
part of operation desert shield stealth fighter planes and the 
aircraft carrier john f kennedy are also headed to saudi arabia to 
protect it from iraqi expansionism 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said iraq has 
continued to increase its armed forces in kuwait and they now 
number about 160000 
saddam has been under international quarantine since his aug 2 
powergrab or what he calls an eternal merger with kuwait 
in a long verbal attack read on iraqi television thursday 
saddam repeatedly called bush a liar and said a shooting war 
could produce body bags courtesy of baghdad 
we continue to pray and pray hard to god so that there will be 
no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of americans 
wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark 
tunnel saddam said 
he called us soldiers massing in saudi arabia the real 
occupiers in the persian gulf 
replied state department deputy spokesman richard boucher we 
havent really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to 
be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts 
to distort the truth 
we believe that his words cannot distract the world from the 
facts of iraqi aggression 
an international land sea and air force has mobilized since 
iraqs invasion which was sparked by disputes over oil land and 
repayment of war loans 
in the largest us military operation since vietnam an 
estimated 20000 american gis have already massed to defend saudi 
arabia 
we dont just arrive said fourstar gen john dailey 
assistant commandant of the us marine corps were there to 
stay for a fairly lengthy period 
egypt syria morocco and bangladesh also committed ground 
troops to a much lesser degree 
the us navy has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of iraq 
they are aided by britain west germany australia canada the 
netherlands and belgium bush was expected to authorize naval 
commanders to use the minimum force necessary to interdict 
shipments to and from iraq a us official said that could 
include firing across the bow to halt a ship 
in the air us air force fliers say they have engaged in a 
little cat and mouse with iraqi warplanes which have retreated 
when weapons radar locks onto them they dont want to play with 
us one us crew chief said 
in kuwait the iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an 
airdefense system according to a us official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity he declined to say if the weapons included 
missiles but the iraqis have them in their arsenal the iraqis 
also possess chemical weapons 
the combined operations are designed to isolate and strangle 
iraq until it retreats from kuwait the quarantine hopes to staunch 
the flow of iraqi oil which is iraqs economic lifeblood and 
clamp down on food and supplies going in 
iraq now controls 20 percent of the worlds oil reserves with 
its conquest of kuwait only saudi arabia has more oil reserves 
the economic chokehold appears to be working 
the lloyds list international newspaper which monitors 
worldwide shipping said iraqs fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships 
has stopped regular trading 
john prescott a shipping correspondent said there was no 
shipping in kuwaiti or iraqi ports and that activity was trailing 
off in the jordanian port of aqaba 
bushs chief objective in his meeting with hussein was to press 
the king to shut down iraqs food and oil supply route from aqaba 
on the red sea 
aqaba is iraqs only outlet now that an international noose has 
tightened bush has indicated the us navy will barricade the port 
from iraqi ships the president also has offered to help offset 
jordans costs because 40 percent of its exports go to iraq and 90 
percent of its oil comes from there 
its our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world 
hussein said he also said of trade with iraq there are no 
shipments at the moment 
a day earlier scores of trucks many with iraqi license plates 
streamed north out of aqaba to amman and onto the desert highway 
bound for iraq 
the jordanian monarch met this week with saddam but he told 
reporters he had no message from baghdad i am not talking on 
behalf of anyone in the area but myself hussein said 
in the united nations libya called for the replacement of us 
forces in the persian gulf with arab league forces and un 
soldiers 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi in a letter to the un 
secretarygeneral also called for an emergency security council 
meeting in geneva to remove us forces there was no decision on a 
meeting 
thirtytwo of the 159 un members had filed compliance reports 
by wednesday and all were honoring the sanctions iraq 
also thursday saudi arabia called for an emergency conference 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to discuss how 
much oil to pump 
the minister denied the kingdom had notified any of its 
customers of any cutbacks in oil supply reports attributed to the 
japanese foreign ministry said saudi arabia told us european and 
japanese oil companies of a 1520 percent cutback in its oil supply 
in september 
meanwhile egypts official middle east news agency said 
thursday that saddam was the target of an assassination attempt 
which led to largescale arrests including some close 
associates of the iraqi strongman 
the agency quoted witnesses as saying tanks and armored cars are 
patrolling the streets of baghdad there was no independent 
confirmation of the report by the governmentrun news agency which 
did not say when the reported attempt occurred

president bush said thursday that 
king hussein assured him jordan would close a vital port to most 
iraqi commerce the president said he had no feeling of hope 
that iraq would roll back its army and dispatched thousands more 
marines to the persian gulf 
at a news conference at his vacation home in maine the 
president also expressed concern about reports that americans were 
being rounded up in kuwait by the occupying iraqi military 
after meeting for two hours with hussein bush was asked whether 
the situation in the gulf region were stabilizing or drawing closer 
to war i dont know that i can choose between the two options 
he replied 
bush also said he has not yet decided whether to sign an order 
calling up reserve units 
later the pentagon announced that the president had ordered 
us ship commanders in the middle east to intercept all ships 
carrying goods to or from iraq or kuwait and a pentagon official 
said the order also applied to iraqbound shipments at the 
jordanian port of aqaba 
the order authorized ship commanders to use the minimum force 
necessary to stop any ship suspected of carrying goods to or from 
kuwait or iraq if the ship refused to stop or to be diverted from 
its course 
to the maximum extent possible we will conduct operations 
without the use of force the presidential order said a pentagon 
source said earlier that those steps could include attempting to 
block the ships passage or firing a warning shot across the bow 
the president met with the jordanian leader and later with 
saudi arabias foreign minister as military forces in the persian 
gulf continued to grow 
pentagon officials said in washington the united states was 
building its marine deployment in saudi arabia toward a total of 
45000 along with the other military services already massing in 
the area the pentagon also said intelligence estimates now put the 
iraqi force in kuwait at 160000 and a state department official 
said iraq had established an air defense system around the occupied 
kuwait city 
the defense department meantime estimated that the deployment 
of us air ground and naval forces in defense of saudi arabia 
will cost 118 billion through september 
the announcement said the expense beyond could not be estimated 
because the size and composition of the armed forces in the 
operation and their level of activity are still evolving 
iraqs invasion of kuwait two weeks ago and positioning of its 
troops near kuwaits border with saudi arabia touched off the 
international crisis 
bush was asked about reports that the iraqis had ordered 
americans in kuwait to report to a hotel anything that compels 
individuals to do something against their will of course concern 
me he said 
for the second time in three days he said that united 
nationsbacked economic sanctions were beginning to take their toll 
on iraq but when pressed for details he mentioned only a report 
that bakers in iraq had been told to stop making confections 
bush said in advance of thursdays meeting that he would press 
king hussein to deny iraq access to the port at aqaba the last 
remaining waterway left open for the baghdad regime 
he was asked whether hussein had offered such assurances and 
replied yes 
secretary of state james a baker iii said jordan is seeking 
some guidance about a provision in the unbacked trade embargo 
that allows food for humanitarian purposes 
aqaba is iraqs main outlet now in the face of an international 
boycott if hussein fails to act bush has indicated the us navy 
will set up a barricade to block iraqi trade from aqaba the 
president also has offered to help offset jordans costs of cutting 
off business with iraq 
saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal after meeting with 
bush said he thanked the president for protecting the kingdom 
we still hope that conflict can be avoided but if and only if 
iraq withdraws from kuwait and legalities return to kuwait he 
said 
bush made his comments as saddam dampened any hopes of a 
diplomatic settlement the iraqi president issued a bellicose 
statement threatening the united states and calling bush a liar 
the statement by a spokesman broadcast in baghdad and carried 
live on american television warned that thousands of americans 
would be sent home wrapped in sad coffins if a military 
showdown occurs 
hussein said he hoped the crisis will begin to deescalate 
however he also said i am not talking on behalf of anyone in 
the area but myself 
the united states is irritated at the king because of his 
defense of saddam and refusal to abide by un sanctions on the 
other hand officials say they recognize that hussein is in a tough 
spot with a powerful and aggressive iraq as his neighbor and a 
large palestinian population in his country sympathetic to saddam 
the already formidable us military buildup in the gulf kept 
growing 
pentagon sources said the marine corps was building up to a 
force of 45000 in the mideast its largest deployment since the 
vietnam war 
the marines will join tens of thousands of army navy and air 
force troops already on the scene 
were there to stay for a fairly lengthy period gen john 
dailey assistant commandant of the marine corps said in an 
associated press interview 
rep larry smith dfla said bush should send transport planes 
to pick up the americans who are being kept in kuwait and should 
tell the iraqis that if there was any trouble the president of 
the united states will consider it an act of war 
a senior us official said iraq had constructed an air defense 
system around the city 
meanwhile us fliers ground crews in saudi arabia said 
american pilots have locked in their weapons radar on iraqi 
planes several times recently causing the iraqis to turn around 
and fly away

japanese pleasure boats southwest of tokyo injuring a boat 
captain japanese officials said thursday 
us military officials contacted by the associated press said 
only that an investigation was under way 
however an official with the japanese defense facilities 
administration confirmed us fighters were in the area when the 
incidents occurred wednesday 
the us military has informed us that us navy fighters were 
there but we have no further details said the official on 
condition of anonymity 
two fighters buzzed the yacht bell on wednesday near utonejima 
an island 87 miles southwest of tokyo according to maritime safety

the yachts captain hajime okayama said he was knocked off 
balance and hurt his back 
the planes flew at us like they were in bombing formation and 
we were their target okayama said it was very frightening

but he was unable to see any marks that would identify their 
nationality 
naruse said that about one hour later two fighters flying low 
over waters near oshima island 62 miles southwest of tokyo buzzed 
the yacht slow hand no one was injured 
kyodo news service said the maritime safety agency japans

imaginary enemy targets both incidents occurred near an air 
corridor used for training by the us military naruse said 
kyodo said the fighters were flying so low that the four people 
aboard the slow hand feared the planes would hit the yachts mast 
the news service also said that officials with the maritime 
safety agency have received at least five other unconfirmed reports 
of similar incidents in the past two months 
the presence of the us armed forces in japan under a mutual 
security pact is still a sensitive topic here and reports of 
accidents involving us military personnel receive wide publicity

gen efrain rios montt who has both 
seized and lost the presidency in military coups signed up 
thursday as a candidate for that office in a november election 
his action conflicts with legal opinions saying he is ineligible 
to run because of the 1982 coup that carried him to power 
the retired general a bornagain christian and lawandorder 
candidate took power after the coup ousted gen romeo lucas garcia 
on march 23 1982 
rios montt in turn was removed by gen oscar humberto mejia 
victores on aug 8 1983 
guatemalas supreme court in a nonbinding opinion sought by 
congress last year said rios montt cannot be president or vice 
president because of a constitutional ban on the holding of those 
posts by people who assumed power in a coup 
last month the association of national dignitaries made up of 
people who drew up the current constitution arrived at the same 
conclusion 
in addition street crime and other violence is on the rise in 
guatemala and human rights workers and others are worried that 
rios montts eyeforaneye brand of justice will lead to further 
abuses in a country already plagued with them 
during his time in office he sent more than a dozen convicted 
leftists before firing squads 
rios montt is running with the backing of three of guatemalas 
19 registered parties 
nine candidates have signed up for the presidency including 
jorge carpio nicolle a journalist defeated five years ago by 
incumbent vinicio cerezo both he and rios montt have done well in 
early polls 
there will be a runoff on jan 6 if no candidate wins a majority 
in the nov 11 election 
if guatemalas elections registry refuses to accept his 
candidacy rios montt can appeal through the court system

actors equity reversed itself thursday and 
said it would allow a white british actor to play a eurasian in the 
10 million broadway production of the hit london musical miss 
saigon 
the vote to approve actor jonathan pryce came at a special 
meeting of the unions 70member council called in response to a 
petition from more than 600 equity members outraged by last weeks 
decision to bar the actor some 54 members of the council took part 
in the meeting which lasted nearly six hours 
the council determined that indeed mister pryce qualifies as 
a star in accordance with the criteria established in the agreement 
between equity and the league of american theaters and producers 
said alan eisenberg the unions executive secretary star 
performers from other countries usually are given automatic 
approval to perform in the united states 
the council stated that it had never been equitys intention 
for this issue to reflect in any way on mister pryce whose 
excellence and abilities the union has consistently acknowledged 
eisenberg said 
the unions reversal was taken as a sign of encouragment by 
producer cameron mackintosh who had scrapped the musicals 
broadway engagement after equitys initial vote 
over the next few days i will confer with members of the 
creative team and with jonathan pryce to determine if it will be 
possible for the production to be reinstated for broadway 
mackintosh said late thursday 
a final decision was not expected until sometime next week said 
mackintosh spokesman marc thibodeau miss saigon was to begin 
previews here in march 
in changing its mind the council took into consideration 
mackintoshs willingness to respond to three issues about the show 
eisenberg said they were his written commitment to seek 
qualified asian actors as replacements or understudies on broadway 
and to originate the role in future companies his assistance 
in the vocal training of those asian actors who may be considered 
for such roles and pryces removal of prosthetics on his eyes 
for makeup immediately upon his becoming aware that their 
intended use offended members of the americanasian community 
mackintosh had said that cancellation of the 10 million 
production which had a record 25 million in advance ticket sales 
would cost him about 600000 
the controversy prompted debate over the issues of 
nontraditional casting the lack of job of opportunities for 
ethnic minority actors and artistic freedom 
the debate is no longer about the casting of miss saigon but 
the art of acting itself mackintosh said last week 
equity had denied permission for pryce to repeat his london 
performance as a eurasian pimp in the american production because 
the casting of a caucasian actor made up to appear asian is an 
affront to the asian community 
the controversy began after equitys committee on racial 
equality received complaints about the shows casting from 
playwright david henry hwang who wrote the broadway hit m 
butterfly and asian actor bd wong 
the committee decided it should take a stand said chuck 
patterson its chairman 
at a news conference thursday patterson said mackintosh did not 
allow asianamerican actors to try out for pryces role in the new 
york production a spokesman for mackintosh said the british actor 
already was the producers first choice to play the part on 
broadway 
mackintosh is one of the most successful producers in london and 
in new york among his other hits which are still running in both 
cities are cats les miserables and the phantom of the 
opera 
miss saigon is a love story about an american soldier set 
during the closing days of the vietnam war in 1975 the musical has 
lavish special effects including a helicopter that lands on stage 
and takes off 
pryce won the olivier award londons equivalent of the tony 
for his performance in miss saigon 
the union has veto power over foreign actors and pryce has 
appeared on broadway twice before he won a tony in 1977 for his 
performance in comedians and later starred in dario fos 
accidental death of an anarchist in 1984 
pryce leaves the cast of the london production of miss 
saigon at the beginning of september his replacement will be 
another white actor hilton mcrae

magellan bounced radar waves off venus 
on thursday in the first test of the spacecrafts ability to yield 
the best pictures ever made of the planets cloudcovered landscape 
magellan is beaming a signal to the surface of venus for the 
first time said ed sherry magellan science operations manager 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory everything is acting just as 
expected 
during the test scheduled to end friday magellan was 
programmed to bounce radar waves off venus as it orbited the planet 
four times 
during each orbit the returning radar echoes were expected to 
produce data that computers on earth will process into seven to 10 
postage stampsized pictures of venus landscape each image is 
supposed to cover a 15by15mile area 
clouds prevent optical cameras from viewing the venusian 
surface so magellan was designed to use radar waves to make 
pictures and maps 
sherry said engineers wont know until sometime friday if the 
spacecraft successfully collected the radar echoes the data wont 
be processed into pictures until sometime this weekend he added 
the national aeronautics and space administration doesnt plan 
to release the test pictures unless they reveal some interesting 
discovery sherry said pictures will be released next month after 
magellan formally starts making images and maps of venus on aug 29 
magellan went into orbit around venus on aug 10 after a 
948millionmile trip from earth the spacecraft was launched from 
the shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 the mission costs 744 
million including 413 million for the spacecraft 
sherry said the test that started at 331 pm pdt thursday was 
designed to assure that magellans radar can make pictures of venus 
and to adjust the radar waves so the pictures are focused 
the test began when the spaceship automatically followed 
computer commands and turned its main antenna toward venus the 
second planet from the sun 
six minutes later magellans radar was operating bouncing 
radar waves off the planets surface as the spacecraft swooped 
southward from venus north pole as planned the radar went off 
automatically at 413 pm pdt after turning its antenna toward 
earth magellan then started beaming the information back to earth 
sherry said 
the radar information was being received at nasa deep space 
network stations at goldstone calif and in australia and spain 
he said 
the first batch of information was being sent from goldstone to 
jet propulsion laboratory both by phone lines and in more complete 
form by truck 
the truck driver will be greeted with a case of beer sherry 
said

a codefendant of manuel noriega was 
sentenced thursday to 10 years in prison and was described as the 
united states big gun in the racketeering case against the 
deposed panamanian leader 
enrique a kiki pretelt acknowledged conspiring with noriega 
to take bribes from tampabased drug smugglers to help ferry 
colombian marijuana safely through panama and disguise the profits 
us district judge william castagna set a special status on 
pretelts term that could help the 47yearold panamanian jeweler 
win an early parole the judge told him to return after he 
testifies in noriegas drugracketeering case in a separate 
indictment in miami 
pretelts attorney george tragos said it would probably be at 
least three years until pretelt is considered for parole 
tragos had asked for the special parole status the government 
agreed citing mitigating circumstances that included pretelts 
clean record his cooperation as a witness against noriega and his 
voluntary surrender 
hes going to be fairly devastating to the noriega defense 
tragos said hes probably the best witness the government has 
a federal prosecutor from miami told castagna that pretelt was 
expected to be a substantial witness at noriegas trial next year 
noriega in prison near miami is accused in a february 1988 
indictment of taking 46 million in bribes from colombias 
medellin drug cartel to turn panama into a waystation for 
usbound drugs 
tragos said that pretelt was a legitimate wellrespected 
businessman who with the exception of this case was clean as a 
whistle 
the attorney said pretelt got a good sentencing deal because 
prosecutors in noriegas drug racketeering case in miami wanted his 
cooperation 
federal authorities in south florida approved the plea presented 
to castagna in june making it easier for them to question pretelt 
about his dealings with the expanamanian leader 
during the 50minute hearing pretelt acknowledged his 
wrongdoing and apologized as 12 family members stood near him in 
front of the courtroom 
i know i did wrong im sorry for what i did and am doing 
everything to make it right pretelt told castagna 
some family members spoke up asking the judge for leniency and 
telling him pretelt had never before been in trouble with the law 
pretelt promised to cooperate fully and agreed to forfeit 
108000 the amount he got for his part in the transactions 
tragos said 
tragos said his client once a close associate of noriegas 
broke with the dictator in 1985 because of illegal activities 
pretelt pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money in one 
drug deal and to aiding a second marijuana smuggling attempt by 
making the connections to relabel a shipment from colombia as being 
of panamanian origin 
as part of his plea agreement he acknowledged working with 
nowconvicted tampa drug smugglers in a partnership called 
servicios turisticos spanish for tourists services set up to 
launder drug proceeds 
a fourth silent partner in their business was general manuel 
noriega according to the 10page plea agreement 
the document said noriega and the other partners each received a 
commission every time steven michael kalish deposited drug proceeds 
in panamanian bank accounts 
kalish has pleaded guilty to other drug charges and has been 
cooperating with the government 
the miami trial of noriega has been delayed until at least 
january 
castagna said he was satisfied that pretelt would not repeat his 
mistake he sentenced him to serve his time at a federal prison 
southwest of miami

two promoterrappers have blended rap music with 
goodnatured ethnic humor to come up with as kosher as they wanna 
be a tongueincheek parody of the bawdy rap group 2 live crew 
the duo called 2 live jews is made up of easy irving known in 
real life as joe stone and mc moisha played by comedian eric 
lambert 
both stone and lambert are jewish which gave them the latitude 
to make fun with such hit songs as oy its so humid a takeoff 
on crews raunchy hit me so horny 
stone and lamberts record is produced by hot productions a 
production company in south miami owned by stones father henry 
we thought it could be a good piece of material henry stone 
said thursday we need a little humor in this world 
the miami group 2 live crew drew attention when a federal judge 
in fort lauderdale ruled that as nasty as they wanna be was 
obscene in june broward county sheriff nick navarro arrested 
members of the group after a performance in hollywood of their 
raunchier songs the band members face an october court date on 
obscenity charges 
the parody group has even made a video and has offered it to 
mtv the elder stone said 
the songs with names like jap rap and jokin jews 
have the potential to offend but henry stone said the feedback has 
been positive so far 
weve heard very little negative said the elder stone he 
dismissed the fears of the antidefamation leagues arthur 
teitelbaum who said he hadnt heard the album but opposes all 
stereotyping 
the songs authors said 2 live crew heard the record and thought 
it was funny 
the blackandwhite video features the two as 80yearold 
performers kibitzing in rhyme 
we wanted to create an aura of the early days when video was 
cheap film and there were little hairs on the screen joe stone 
said in an earlier interview

indias foreign minister left for iraq on 
thursday night saying he would appeal to president saddam hussein 
to avoid war and allow l85000 indian citizens to leave iraq and 
iraqioccupied kuwait 
external affairs minister inder k gujral said before departing 
on commercial flights via london and amman jordan that he hopes 
to contribute to preventing a flareup of hostilities in the persian 
gulf crisis that threatens economic and financial calamity for 
india the worlds second most populous country 
but he emphasized he is neither a mediator nor a messenger and 
suggested the crisis is not yet ripe for mediation i dont think 
that bridge is ready to cross the concerned parties must make 
up their minds if they want to defuse or not 
to tell saddam hussein to let my people come out that is my 
primary concern and also to try to see if better sense can prevail 
on all sides to see that the situation does not go to the 
flarepoint gujral told reporters 
he met soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in moscow 
tuesday then flew here for talks with secretary of state james a 
baker on wednesday and national security adviser brent scowcroft on 
thursday 
gujral said he will approach the iraqis primarily concerned 
about indias interests starting with the welfare of 10000 
citizens in iraq and 175000 in kuwait 
because of geography and economic links with the gulf if god 
forbid something unfortunately goes wrong it affects us in every 
possible way he said 
india imports about half of its petroleum half of the imported 
petroleum comes from kuwait and iraq gujral said 
half of indian oil purchases from the soviet union also flow to 
india via swap from iraq he said and indians working in the area 
provide a substantial portion of indias foreign exchange also 
various indian projects in iraq and kuwait are under agreements for 
partial payment in oil he added 
thus the indian public and government are extremely worried 
gujral said

a man charged with raping a woman with a 
multiple personality disorder pleaded innocent thursday after the 
victim alternated between three identities during courtroom 
questioning 
the case raises new questions about sexual consent and mental 
illness the victim says two of her personalities were raped but 
defendant mark a peterson contends one of the womans 
personalities consented 
during questioning the 26yearold oshkosh woman closed her 
eyes gently and paused as she moved between her personalities 
herself and characters called franny and jennifer at the request 
of district attorney joseph paulus 
can i have jennifer the one who likes to have fun paulus 
asked 
of course the woman replied smiling momentarily before 
closing her eyes a few seconds later she opened her eyes and 
blurted hi mr paulus in a slightly higher voice 
winnebago county circuit judge robert hawley required the woman 
to take an oath each time she changed personalities and the 
lawyers formally introduced themselves to the different 
personalities assuming such knowledge did not transfer between 
personalities 
during her hourlong testimony the woman described how she 
believed peterson raped her in his car after she told him she 
suffered from a mental illness 
the woman said she had been raped june 11 while she was 
jennifer a funloving promiscuous 20yearold woman who liked to 
dance to rock music 
after the couple had sex he said can i have franny back i 
said ok the woman told the court 
peterson 29 of oshkosh sat quietly and showed no emotion as 
the woman testified he later appeared briefly before the judge and 
pleaded innocent to a charge of seconddegree sexual assault 
the charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison on 
conviction hawley agreed there was probable cause to bind peterson 
over for trial but did not immediately set a trial date peterson 
is free on a signature bond 
legal experts agree the case is problematic on several fronts 
if the woman is not palpably mentally ill then the 
prosecution has problems said leonard kaplan a university of 
wisconsin law school professor observing the case in oshkosh a 
city of 50000 in eastcentral wisconsin if she is mentally ill 
she cant consent 
the victim has as many as 21 different personalities a mental 
illness that typically develops after a traumatic childhood 
experience psychologists said 
she told police two of her personalities jennifer and emily a 
vulnerable 6yearold girl were assaulted by peterson in june 
the defense counters the woman consented and peterson had no 
idea the woman was mentally ill 
paulus said he will be forced to introduce several of the 
victims personalities to a jury through her testimony during the 
trial expected in october 
i wouldnt say im looking forward to it it is unusual 
paulus said you are talking about a subject matter that is 
somewhat foreign to everybody 
defense lawyer edward salzsieder has asked that the charge be 
dismissed 
there is a question of when does anybody know a person is 
mentally ill he said 
according to court records the woman met peterson june 9 at a 
park when the victim was portraying a personality she called franny 
two days later peterson went to the womans home and invited 
her out for coffee at the restaurant the woman reportedly 
introduced some of her personalities to peterson including 
jennifer the records said 
after the pair left the restaurant jennifer agreed to have 
sexual intercourse at the mans suggestion in a car peterson told 
police 
the criminal complaint alleged peterson noted that during sex 
the womans 6yearold personality emily appeared before the 
woman eventually became franny again 
neighbors have told police they warned peterson that the woman 
had a mental disorder 
paulus said he must prove three things that the victim had a 
mental illness that she was incapable of appraising her own 
conduct and that peterson knew about the illness 
they all present roadblocks he said adding that he has 
become well enough acquainted with the victim that he can summon 
her various personalities at will 
it could turn out to be the battle of the experts and 
persuading a jury which expert is right kaplan said 
multiplepersonality disorder is usually caused by early 
childhood trauma especially sexual abuse and affects one person 
in 10000 said dr nancy perry a milwaukee clinical psychologist 
the patient separates one part of his or herself from another to 
avoid facing the trauma perry said

libya on thursday called for replacing the 
us military in the persian gulf with arab league and un forces 
in lima peru un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said the use of military power to enforce un sanctions against 
iraq without approval from the un security council would violate 
the uns charter 
american officials have said the usled multinational force 
blocking ships with iraqi cargo is acting in line with the un 
sanctions

arab league forces and us naval personnel in the persian gulf 
should be replaced by un forces 
in his comments during a press conference at perus foreign 
ministry perez de cuellar said that article 41 of the un charter 
states that any blockade has to have un security council approval

intervention whatever the country would not be in accordance with 
the letter or spirit of the united nations charter

britain china france and the soviet union were meeting to 
discuss the iraqi order that americans and britons in iraq gather 
at hotels because of unspecified threats in washington the us

controlling regional conflicts and has said it would only 
participate in a military operation in the gulf under the un flag

interim report from perez de cuellar about compliance with the un 
economic embargo against iraq though the embargo is intended to be 
binding un members voted no specific measures to enforce it 
the committee is to meet friday canadian diplomats said they 
intended to raise the issue of violations of the embargo and how 
the committee would monitor compliance beyond official government 
statements

security council can declare a military blockade and appeal to 
member states to enforce it 
thirtytwo of the 159 un members had filed compliance reports 
by wednesday and all were honoring the sanctions a full un 
report is due by the end of the month 
bulgaria was the only reporting nation to emphasize the 
hardships imposed by the compliance and it reserved the right to 
appeal to the council for relief it said however that it was 
fully implementing the embargo 
under the un charter nations that suffer because of their 
compliance with un enforcement actions may appeal to the council 
for relief usually in the form of an exemption 
the nations that filed reports wednesday were argentina 
australia austria brazil bulgaria canada chile cyprus

americas streets and campuses which rang 
with protest in the era of vietnam are quiet as the bush 
administration challenges iraqs saddam hussein in the persian 
gulf they may or may not stay that way 
from washington to san francisco protest demonstrations have 
been few and poorly attended since the united states sent troops to 
saudi arabia in response to saddams aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
summer school is winding up at the nations colleges and 
universities and most students are away but even for summer the 
response has been notably calm 
one reason is that americans view saddam as a villain whereas 
many thought the united states overreached in its bombing of north 
vietnam according to experts who have observed antiwar movements 
both from within and from without

of the country

cholesterolconscious people have long been 
saying hold the butter now a study suggests they should 
spread the margarine sparingly too 
the study found that hardened vegetable fat a primary 
ingredient of margarine and shortening raises cholesterol in the 
blood it might even be worse than saturated fat the 
longrecognized demon in the war on unhealthy eating 
experts cautioned that margarine is still a healthier choice 
than butter however the new research contradicts the widely held 
belief that the vegetable fats that margarine contains are harmless 
to the heart 
the study raises questions about trans fatty acids which make 
margarine and shortening hard so they can be used for baking 
frying and spreading about a quarter of the fat in a typical stick 
of margarine is trans fatty acids

the joint work in albania and iraq of 
the two german foreign services unthinkable a year ago probably 
will not happen again after unification the east german foreign 
ministry will disappear 
in baghdad the east german ministry opened some of the 
apartments in its compound to about 40 west german workers who fled 
the iraqi interior after the invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
officials of the west german foreign ministry reported 
they are staying free of charge in rooms vacated when east 
germany began reducing its diplomatic ranks abroad 
when thousands of albanians sought refuge at the west german 
embassy in tirana in july as a means of escaping their communist 
homeland east germans helped their western colleagues with 
translations and transit paperwork 
the east german embassy also sent supplies to help the west 
germans cope with the crush 
theres a great willingness on the personal level to cooperate 
in a pragmatic way a west german foreign ministry spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity 
but on the formal embassy work side theres little one can do 
at the moment because as long as youve got separate east german 
citizenship as long as youve got different rules in the field of 
trade and economics each one has to do his own thing 
as unification nears thousands of east german diplomats expect 
to lose their jobs the west germans dont want them because of 
their old ties to the communist party or even to the secret police 
called the stasi 
in the east german foreign service most or nearly all members 
have at least been communist party members and a lot of 
them have had close contacts with the stasi and that makes it very 
difficult for us to imagine having them in our service said a 
foreign ministry source 
east germany was moscows front line against the west for years 
and still belongs to the sovietled warsaw pact 
its secret service was one of the most active in the soviet 
bloc and there is great concern that using east berlins foreign 
service officers in a united german diplomatic corps would be too 
risky even with the cold war ended 
sources in bonn say a few east german diplomats may be kept if 
they are cleared and have special qualifications 
we must face the facts foreign minister markus meckel of 
east germany said this month and acknowledged that most of his 
diplomats would lose their jobs 
the east german foreign ministry has announced plans to cut its 
roster to about 500 people by years end there were 2800 
employees in march 1800 of them overseas 
eighteen east german embassies and consulates are to close by 
the end of september said hansmartin meckel ministry personnel 
chief and the foreign ministers brother 
he said west german occupational experts were studying 
retraining plans and one option was teaching dismissed government 
employees to sell insurance in a united capitalist germany 
we cant simply add these ministries to ours with all their 
staff said a west german government source these people will 
have to find new jobs 
there will be a lot of new job opportunities not only in the 
private sector but particularly in the new government 
structures he said 
skilled bureaucrats will be needed in the five state governments 
east germans will create in october elections to mirror the west 
german federal system the source added 
officials of the west german foreign ministry have begun an 
inventory of east german diplomatic properties around the world to 
determine what should be kept and which facilities can be sold 
east german missions particularly in third world or east 
european countries may be bigger or better situated than those of 
west germany they say 
where they have a building big enough for what we need there 
is no ideological reason why we shouldnt take it said the west 
german ministry source we will not say because communists have 
been in this building we wont touch it 
although experienced east german diplomats may be out of work 
west germany is looking for new ones 
it announced plans to advertise for applicants in east german 
newspapers with the motto the foreign service is open to all 
germans

this vast nation of steppes rich in 
animal species is beginning to count its living wealth in order to 
improve conservation 
mongoliaa many rare animals include the snow leopard gobi 
desert bears and wild bactrian camels it has equally rare species 
prized by hunters like the argali sheep and ibex 
officials have set limits for years on the number of each 
species that can be killed but seldom knew how many it had to 
start with 
in the case of the beautiful predatory snow leopard the result 
has been controversy over whether it faces extinction or is 
becoming n bags 
i used to think that you were much more farsighted than you 
actually displayed the iraqi president said in a statement read 
by an announcer on iraqi television that was billed as an open 
letter to bush 
the spoken translation was provided by cable news network but 
since the speech was aimed at bush it also carried subtitles 
provided by iraqi tv 
in his most personal statement to date on the crisis that began 
with his aug 2 invasion of kuwait the iraqi president accused 
bush of trying to humiliate arabs by the use of us military force 
youre going to be defeated he said 
saddams statement came as jordans king hussein was flying to 
maine from washington to meet with bush the jordanian monarch was 
reportedly bearing a message from saddam 
a day earlier in a speech at the pentagon bush said saddam had 
lied to his arab neighbors about his intentions in kuwait and said 
such dishonesty made him a threat to strategic saudi arabia 
it is saddam who invaded an arab state it is saddam who now 
threatens the arab nation bush said then we by contrast now 
seek to assist our arab friends in their hour of need 
iraq has insisted it has no intention of attacking saudi arabia 
where about 20000 us troops already have been dispatched to 
counter any further iraqi seizure of the huge oil reserves in the 
persian gulf other nations with troops in saudi arabia include 
egypt syria morocco and bangladesh 
in the statement saddam referred to iraq as this great arab 
nation chosen by god to be the nation of prophets 
without directly mentioning his own occupation of kuwait saddam 
said the foreign forces in saudi arabia were the true occupiers 
saddams overthrow of kuwait has been widely condemned by the 
international community which has imposed choking economic 
sanctions against him 
in the statement saddam repeated a threat to act to defend 
islamic holy sites in saudi arabia an indirect threat against the 
multinational forces in the desert kingdom 
saddams statement also followed a report earlier today by the 
egypts middle east news agency saying the iraqi president had 
been the target of an assassination attempt 
the report quoted travelers from iraq as saying the alleged 
assassination bid had prompted largescale arrests and a military 
clampdown in the iraqi capital the report could not be 
independently confirmed

georgi panchev and thousands of other 
bulgarians have spent hours this summer outside the greek 
consulate waiting in vain for travel visas 
tens of thousands of east europeans have discovered their new 
freedom to travel may not mean other people want them to visit 
if theyd just put up a sign saying we dont take any more 
bulgarians then i wouldnt stand here and wait panchev 42 
said as a brusque guard turned a couple away from the consulate 
door 
a person loses all his hope waiting here todor dishkov 
said we are waiting like beggars for something to happen 
an informal survey of conditions imposed by western countries 
which used to complain about communist restrictions on foreign 
travel suggests britain greece and the united states lead the 
list of difficult destinations 
britain for example requires exhaustive proof of financial 
resources and possession of a return ticket 
travel restrictions vary widely 
hungarians and czechoslovaks need no visas for most of western 
europe but bulgarians romanians and poles face waits of weeks or 
months for approval western governments increasingly fear the 
poorer east europeans simply wont return home 
romanians typically have waited 40 to 60 days for the 30000 
visas the italian consulate in bucharest issued in the last seven 
months 
czechoslovaks simply board an overnight tour bus see venice by 
day and ride home the next night 
that exhausting form of tourism illustrates the second 
difficulty for east europeans lack of western money to spend 
nearly all east european countries have revised official 
exchange rates to favor western visitors but popular demand for 
dollars or marks remains so high that black markets still thrive 
the shortage of hard currency lure of western consumer luxury 
and comparatively good wages paid in the west for even menial jobs 
tempt many east europeans to work at least part of the time while 
abroad 
west germany and the united states with its large polish 
community are favorite destinations for poles seeking work that 
often pays more in a month than they make at home in a year 
university graduates in czechoslovakia where the communists 
made dissident intellectuals into coal stokers often go to west 
germany to earn marks for a new car furniture or video recorder 
of the estimated 50000 bulgarians visiting greece before it 
slowed the visa process some helped harvest olives for a few days 
such arrangements officially illegal may not disturb western 
employers eastern workers or governments very much communism made 
finagling a way of life in eastern europe and it was bound to move 
west when the iron curtain fell 
regular bending of the rules does worry authorities however 
poles have earned a reputation throughout europe as peddlers and 
smugglers thanks mainly to a few businessmen who travel 
regularly to berlin or vienna 
berlin put visa restrictions on poles at the beginning of july 
in an effort to avert curbs by austria the only western nation 
that does not require visas of its citizens poland imposed strict 
customs controls and invited the austrians to help enforce them 
it is harder to stop an educated east european who wants to 
leave his country for good 
the brain drain is a particular problem for bulgaria and 
romania where shattered economies offer little hope of riches or 
satisfaction 
bulgarias passport office said more than 10 percent of the 
44105 people with higher education who went abroad from january to 
july did not return most were under age 40 
with a rapidly aging population of just under 9 million 
bulgaria cannot afford such a loss of young talent 
onequarter of the 220000 ethnic germans in romanias 
transylvania region have emigrated since free travel became 
possible in january 
virginia young us consul general in bucharest estimates 
about onethird of the 15 million romanians who have received 
passports this year would like to live in america 
most lack any of the qualifications for obtaining a visa 
interviews on emigration requests are backed up to november 1991 
for lack of space and staff young said 
few countries have stopped granting requests for asylum to east 
europeans romania is a democracy now said klaus branch of the 
west german embassy in bucharest 
that argument is lost on ordinary east europeans whose dreary 
daily routine has brightened little with the advent of freedom

just turned 21 christian slater is still 
struggling to get out of high school in the movies that is 
he was the high school killer in the black comedy heathers 
now hes a shy student who uses a pirate radio station to inflame 
his fellow high schoolers in pump up the volume 
im trying to put high school behind me and age a little 
bit smiled slater whose innocent face could easily pass for 
midteens i think pump up the volume will be my last high 
school film 
on the set of the movie i was talking in an interview about 
how i would like to grow a little bit and play a character who had 
a bit of scruffiness to him a little bit older then along came 
young guns 2 which was perfect 
in pump up the volume slater is a newcomer to an arizona 
school a total outsider who nevertheless communicates with his 
frenetic xrated rantings and heavymetal music on his makeshift 
radio station the new line cinema film is obviously aimed at the 
young crowd but the star has some impressive highpitch scenes 
before the microphone 
he can even find a message in the movie it deals with freedom 
of speech expressing yourself saying what you really feel in 
situations and of just being the best you can be and not being 
afraid 
on young guns 2 slater was the new kid in the block that 
included emilio estevez kiefer sutherland and lou diamond phillips 
from the first movie 
there was no feeling of being tested or anything said 
slater i felt immediately accepted into that group they were 
very supportive 
i was the new rider and i had a lot of catching up to do 
working with the guns kiefer was fast on the draw we had a lot of 
races luckily we werent given real bullets lou was an excellent 
rider and he was teaching me different mounts and feeling 
comfortable in the saddle again 
riding is a difficult thing if you have a moment of lapse of 
concentration the horse can spook anything can happen which is 
what i think happened to lou late in filming diamond almost 
strangled on a rope when his horse ran away the actor managed to 
escape with only a broken arm 
slater has been acting almost from birth the son of stage and 
tv actor michael hawkins and mary jo slater now a casting agent 
he was three months old when his mother brought him onstage in a 
play according to family legend she held him aloft and declared 
this is your life my son 
the boy was 9 when he was chosen to appear with dick van dyke in 
a revival of the music man he followed with macbeth nicol 
williamson david copperfield merlin sherlock holmes 
frank langella plus a number of tv specials 
slaters big break came at 16 as sean connerys youthful 
sidekick in the name of the rose 
my first film was the legend of billie jean he recalled 
then to do the name of the rose and play a 14thcentury monk 
just didnt seem like it made any sense to me i didnt think there 
was a prayer of making the transition 
but it turned out to be the greatest experience ive ever had 
i was in awe of mr connery and he lived up to every expectation i 
had of james bond i loved him he was great 
the script called for the young man to be seduced by a lusty 
wench he has a brief interrupted love scene with costar ellen 
greene in pump up the volume otherwise slater tries to avoid 
graphic sex 
im sometimes in the situation where a director will ask to 
expose a little more than i feel is necessary he said i just 
say i dont feel i ever need to do it again unless i truly feel 
it is necessary i felt it was necessary in the name of the 
rose and it was done beautifully i truly feel it is behind me 
literally

network stars scrambled to get into iraq for 
more hot news on the middle east crisis but john palmer late of 
today was here working on a show about somewhat older stories 
like stories that go as far back as 30 years sometimes farther 
the show instant recall a halfhour daily series which 
goes into production on aug 27 sold to about 75 stations it will 
premiere on sept 3 perchance it might someday chronicle the 
today show 
that would be spellbinding television laughs palmer who 
left nbc news in march after 26 years there his final years were 
as the today news anchor until deborah norville was given the 
job in september 
that shift touched off a certain amount of uproar that increased 
when norville succeeded jane pauley as coanchor today has 
been second in ratings since pauley left in january to begin life 
anew in prime time 
palmer a respected newsman who at one time was nbcs white 
house correspondent began his life anew as host of a syndicated 
series originally called only yesterday 
its name later was changed to instant recall lest the series 
be thought of as perhaps too much of a stroll down memory lane he 
says 
it does have a veneer of nostalgia he says but its 
basically a look back at stories not all earthshaking that have 
affected the lives of people with some of those people narrating 
the pieces 
the stories followed by a segment called shared 
recollections john palmers diary are about such varied things 
as 
a 1944 circus fire in hartford conn that killed 138 people 
the toymaker who in 1977 scaled the heights of new yorks world 
trade center the hard way from the outside and was asked for 
his autograph by two cops sent to arrest him 
hurricane carla in 1961 and cbs anchorman dan rathers memories 
of covering it for the houston station where he began his tv career 
therell be two main stories per show each starting with what 
palmer calls a time capsule memory triggers that put the viewer 
in the setting and a lot of music from the year in which the 
story occurred 
it stands or falls on the basis of the quality of the 
stories palmer says there are no recreations its all 
actual news footage 
palmer isnt the only network graduate working on the show 
its executive producer is former abc news vice president av 
westin the senior producer is dan cooper formerly of abcs 
2020 and there are a lot of people here from cbs and nbc 
palmer says 
but now and then the 54yearold journalist does miss those of 
the old gang who still are working at nbc news i feel kind of a 
longing sometimes for a lot of terribly good friends 
but i must say this i was was thinking the other day what a 
difference a year makes that jane pauley and i both have our new 
programs we can both sleep later and if my show is half as 
successful as hers i would be very very happy 
he still keeps in touch with the former today coanchor who 
has had ratings success this summer with her real life with jane 
pauley series of specials 
he also still considers today weatherman willard scott a 
friend likewise the shows prickly anchor bryant gumbel about 
the shows muchwrittenabout woes palmer has this to say 
it wasnt a screwup of the cast it was management 
although when he left nbc he admitted he found that a little 
scary he has no regrets now not one morning have i awakened 
feeling hey maybe you did the wrong thing 
win lose or draw this was right and this is the right 
time

the adventures of ozzie and harriet 
one of the most watched shows in television history was the 
perfect vehicle for the budding music career of the sitcoms 
teenage star 
an awkward lipsynced performance of im walkin blasted 
ricky nelson to the top of the charts a few weeks after the episode 
aired with 60000 copies of the single sold in three days 
years later the same tv teenidol image would obscure ricks 
status as an important figure in pop music history the last link 
to genuine rock n roll and the progenitor of california rock 
the association with the television show was death to rick 
that more than anything is what did him in as far as his image 
went said san francisco rock critic joel selvin author of a 
biography of rick nelson whose 1985 death in an airplane crash 
shocked the nation 
there is no way you could survive coming out of ozzie and 
harriet and be seen as a real authentic rock and roller 
nelsons death is still linked in the publics mind to his 
cocaine use in ricky nelson idol for a nation contemporary 
books 1895 selvin attempts to set the record straight 
the plane crash initially was tied to alleged cocaine freebasing 
aboard the craft however a few weeks after the crash selvin 
writes the investigation focused almost exclusively on the 
troublesome heater in the rear of the passenger cabin the 
testimony was released to the press but headlines about the heater 
starting the fire didnt make quite the splash the freebasing rumor 
did two months before 
in the biography selvin emphasizes the significance of rickys 
california rockabilly a genre he began and how his 
charmed youth produced a nightmarish adulthood marred by heavy 
drug use and a roller coaster career 
the book starts with witness descriptions of the texas crash of 
a world war iivintage douglas dc3 that killed the singer his 
girlfriend and some band members it flashes back to ozzie and 
harriets early years together then traces their sons life and 
career winding up with his starstudded funeral 
detailed attention is given to rickys late 1950s recordings 
which selvin says rank easily with the best of buddy holly the 
everly brothers and elvis 
selvin takes the reader to the lew chuddproduced sessions for 
imperial records that created waitin in school stood up 
believe what you say and my buckets got a hole in it many 
featuring the stinging solos of guitar great james burton 
the book also looks at the darker side of the performers life 
a humdrum acting career a deeply troubled marriage to kristin 
harmon and finally his last days as an isolated drug addict so 
burned out that he wore makeup when he ventured from his mulholland 
drive home 
selvin a critic for the san francisco chronicle for the past 18 
years said hes been a nelson fan since the early 1970s when the 
singer won acclaim for his work with the countryrock stone canyon 
band the same era produced garden party the only outstanding 
song rick wrote 
that song connected with the most important emotional issue of 
his life the lack of acknowledgement for his authentic musical 
accomplishments selvin said 
research and writing the book took six months much of which the 
author spent interviewing friends and musicians who worked with 
rick 
aside from older brother david nelson who sat still for a 
few interviews the family was no help whatsoever selvin said 
harriet nelson and harmon refused to meet with the biographer 
its a funny thing about the nelson family wherever you go 
people have a little story david has the same story it starts 
with the phrase they were just like the tv show which is just 
not so ricky would have been the first to say that selvin said 
though much of the book will appeal to music history buffs 
selvin digs up enough dirt to draw in fans of tellall hollywood 
biographies he depicts the hardworking ozzie nelson as a 
domineering stifling influence on his sons 
whereas the nelsons of tvland were a nice normal middleclass 
family the real nelsons were millionaires hollywood elite on the 
show david was a lawyer in reality he flunked out of high 
school selvin said 
the ricky of ozzies show was a clean teen who rarely crossed 
his parents the real ricky had some rebellious dark periods at 
one point dating a bisexual heroin addict he took away from his 
brother according to selvin 
some of the books best detail was provided by forrest stewart 
rickys close friend during his teen years and chester golasinski 
ricks housekeeper in the years before he died golansinski 
witnessed the singers seclusion with drugaddicted fiancee helen 
blair who also died in the plane crash

did the owner of a nevada diner really contrive 
to create a fifth television network featuring programming about 
sympathetic serial killers and laughaminute watergate antics of 
course not but in the world of television as this look at a 
fictitious network suggests just about anything can happen 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was television history in the making but we 
didnt know it then we couldnt have known could we 
how could we forsee that oc king cole the bluff 
eccentric tycoon of the syncline nevbased last gas diner empire 
would quietly liquidate his fortune and buy five uhf tv stations in 
the top us markets 
i was inspired cole told tv guide before his disappearance 
triggered the international manhunt if fox could come out of 
nowhere and rip off 10 percent of the tv audience i reckon i 
could too and so he did 
who could have foreseen that unforgettable first season whod 
have thought tom selleck could play a handsome wisecracking 
serial killer and become americas no 1 tv idol and people 
magazines sexiest man alive 
whod have thought yow that smarts haldemann would become 
a catch phrase for the nation 
how did it happen how did upstart fifth broadcasting co 
confound the big four and launch that memorable programming 
programming try horse pucky cole would chortle and how did 
he keep it on the air 
thats a mystery like his whereabouts which still preoccupies 
sociologists ted turner the irs organized crime brandon 
tartikoff 17 state and federal grand juries and six cayman islands 
banks still holding his paper 
usa today in its thoughtful 450word profile cole tv genius 
or maniac noted that cole analyzed the big fours programming 
strategies discovered their weaknesses and devised specific 
tactics to exploit them 
ratingswise fridays and saturdays were squat cole said 
fox had sundays cbs had mondays until abcs football season nbc 
won thursdays after bart simpson murdered his family friday was 
abcs what was left 
thus was born the fifth wednesday and coles strategy to win 
it ignore the audiences you dont want and program only for those 
you do 
not only would we go for the 12 to 34yearolds just like fox 
had cole said but we would go for the 50 to 64yearolds 
too at the time coles view was heresy on madison avenue soon 
the agencies paid attention 
cole knew it was our largely ignored elders who watch the most 
tv 33 hours a week and had the fewest dependents highest 
disposable income and most intense fantasies involving angela 
lansbury 
were talking about an audience that would indeed purchase a 
laxative tropical fruitflavored bubble gum which doesnt adhere 
to ones dental work cole told the new york times in its 
thoughtful 4500word profile 
the sticky part was programming how could fifth nail that 
crossover show that would transcend demographic barriers as cole 
reminisced in his final interview all the really lame concepts 
were taken 
whod buy another perfect welladjusted upper middleclass 
black family or an overweight wisecracking workingclass white 
family or a boston bar filled with regulars who dont have 
drinking problems get serious boy 
where was the show with that thirtysomethingsimpsonstwin 
peaks feel 
cole searched in vain for the right production team until he 
heard about two brothers expornography producers whose sitcom 
shoot the moon was rejected by a fox executive as utterly 
tasteless cruel sexist jokes about vile body functions and 
besides we already have married with children 
for roy and darryl pander coles call was a godsend wanted in 
cincinnati the brothers flew to hollywood drove actually but 
the warrant read interstate flight to take a meeting they 
quickly cut a deal 
cole what can i say about the guy except hey hes the 
guy said darryl the shorter fatter one with glasses he gave 
us a break before anybody even knew david lynch stole twin peaks 
from us back at usc film school 
pander bros productions began work on wheres harry with 
roy as writerdirector and darryl as producer their earlier career 
had taught them how to mount a mobile smallscale production that 
could shoot in motel rooms 
selleck virtually wiped out by business reverses and the 
detroit tigers move to mexico city reluctantly agreed to head the 
cast he was certain the role of harry unman meant the end of his 
career as an actor 
i play a serial killer who cares selleck said in many 
interviews id go to a town get a job settle in form 
relationships and sure enough that lunar cycle would kick in 
and id have to leave town again fast 
so did the panders running up big bills in exotic 
outoftheway locales roys curiously unformed scripts were 
studded with great gags but forced selleck to improvise constantly 
selleck careworn graying and challenged for the first time as 
an actor used his financial worries and his personal charm to 
create a compellingly believable psychopath and won unprecedented 
twin emmys for comedy and drama 
it was splendid television tv writers wrote brechtian 
and offputting a tortured huck finn raved the times a 
fugitive for the 90s a date with harry youll always 
remember gushed tv guide 
with wheres harry an established hit cole became an 
instant billionaire when he turned fifth broadcasting into a 
publicly held company and grabbed up another five uhf stations in 
the top 10 markets 
cole went to the pacific rim animation industry for his second 
hit the muriyakis a japanbashing cartoon show about an 
alienated hardworking japanese family whose wisecracking 
papasan buys manhattan

local militiamen and soldiers from 
neighboring zimbabwe stand guard over a pipeline railroad and 
crumbling highway in the soporific heat they talk of past 
campaigns and the possibility of peace 
there was a time when the enemy an ubiquitous rebel army 
accused of many atrocities launched attacks of 1000 men on the 
three facilities which are lifelines to the sea for mozambiques 
inland neighbors 
for the last few months quiet has prevailed in the beira 
corridor ascending from the port of beira through nearly 200 miles 
of fertile savanna flecked with forests and swamps to the vumba 
mountains of zimbabwe 
observers suggest the rebels who remain active on either side 
of the zone prefer to attack poorly equipped government troops 
rather than the heavily armed zimbabwean military 
we have a few firings along the road thats all said col 
michael dube one of the men commanding several thousand zimbabwean 
soldiers who have helped guard the transportation corridor since 
1984 
about 12000 zimbabwean troops are scattered throughout 
mozambique to help government forces 
dubes troops make routine sevenday foot patrols from lamego a 
mosquitoinfested base camp on the edge of swamps about 45 miles 
inland from the indian ocean coast 
armored convoys run another 110 miles westward to the zimbabwean 
brigade headquarters at chimoio just across the border carrying 
supplies to the soldiers and mozambican militia posts 
the corridor has remained open through most of the war closing 
only long enough for repairs to the railway after mine explosions 
and other sabotage by the guerrillas who began fighting in 1977 
two beirabound trains trundle along the corridor most days 
carrying potash and railroad ties from botswana tin and cobalt 
from zaire and zimbabwean tobacco and granite trucks overloaded 
with zambian copper pound along the highway 
western donors and investors have contributed more than 400 
million since 1986 for repairs to the transport system and 
rebuilding beiras port and infrastructure 
keeping soldiers in mozambique costs zimbabwe about 20 million 
a year according to official figures and up to seven times that 
by private estimates zimbabwe is infinitely better off than 
mozambique but still is among the worlds poorer nations 
white settlers who ruled zimbabwe when it was a british colony 
called rhodesia helped establish the rebel force to fight 
mozambiques marxist government mozambique became independent of 
portugal in 1975 two years before renamo was formed 
south africa later became renamos main supporter with the aim 
of undermining mozambique economically and openly supported the 
guerrillas until the two governments signed a peace agreement in 
1984 no government now acknowledges aiding renamo 
president joachim chissanos ruling party known as frelimo 
officially dropped its hardline marxist policies in 1989 in july 
the government said mozambiques first multiparty elections would 
be held next year 
renamo has demanded recognition by the government and free 
westernstyle elections but has not made its political aims clear 
the guerrillas will be allowed to participate in the 1991 elections 
if they lay down their arms 
the war has killed an estimated 600000 mozambicans displaced 
more than 1 million and made the southeast african nation one of 
the poorest in the world nearly half the 15 million people require 
some food assistance and per capita income is less than 200 a year 
peace talks have begun in rome between the government and exiled 
rebel leaders but col dubes men wait for peace with little cheer 
or optimism 
he and his junior officers sipped dao a cheap portuguese red 
wine in a tidy dining tent and said peace would not come easily 
zimbabwean soldiers with their far superior firepower 
equipment and air support have little faith in mozambican 
government troops 
when theres trouble the first thing frelimo do is run 
away said dube a soviettrained veteran of his own countrys 
war for independence which ended a decade ago 
a young officer who asked not to be identified said 
militiamen soldiers and rebels alike turned to banditry 
the zimbabweans have been accused of using armored vehicles 
which are seldom searched to smuggle out ivory gemstones 
valuable carvings and marijuana which grows wild in central and 
northern mozambique

potholes the size of bathtubs pit the 
streets plumbing and electricity fade from reality to memory 
thousands of squatters live in the onceelegant grand hotel 
the smell of too many people in too little space drifts on a 
lazy indian ocean breeze over a city built for 60000 people that 
has become a home of sorts to 400000 most of them squatters 
at the grand hotel everthing burnable was pillaged from the 
casino long ago for cooking and warmth vast chandeliers of no 
use as fuel still hang in the ballroom and lobby shrouded in dust 
beira has fallen victim to one of africas longest and deadliest 
conflicts which has killed an estimated 600000 people and 
displaced 1 million many of whom have fled to refugee camps in 
neighboring countries 
first the nation was convulsed by 10 years of fighting between 
the colonial armies of portugal and neighboring zimbabwe then 
whiteruled rhodesia against marxist guerrillas of the frelimo 
movement 
frelimo led the country to independence in 1975 and two years 
later the brutal renamo rebel movement began a guerrilla war that 
still continues 
in beira people are scratching to survive said chris 
notley a britishborn aid worker 
in the first years of black rule marxist governments 
nationalized key enterprises and private property throughout this 
southeast african nation 
at least 120000 portuguese settlers fled the northern 
provinces they burned farms homes and vehicles sabotaged 
factories and plugged toilets and drains with concrete 
the government has begun opening to the west and some signs of 
revival can be seen in beira 
foreign businesses are negotiating with provincial authorities 
take over businesses buildings and land in and around the city 
electricians are trying to untangle the citys neglected wiring 
the unused golf course mown for the first time in 14 years when 
pope john paul ii visited beira in 1988 now is groomed more often 
aid workers expect recovery to be slow one reason they say is 
a crushing bureacracy inherited from portuguese colonialists and 
administrators supplied by east germany after independence 
mozambicans learned about bureacracy from portugal the most 
backward country in europe said erik greby a danish aid 
executive involved in rehabilitating the harbor put the most 
backward east bloc system on top of that thats why nothing works

chinas economy is sluggish verging on 
recession but exports are booming 
foreign investment has lagged since the brutal crackdown on 
dissent more than a year ago businessmen still worry about 
political instability and are put off by numerous roadblocks to 
profitable joint venturess the bright spot in the chinese economy a 
western 
diplomat said on condition of anonymity if the current trend 
keeps up this years may be the biggest trade surplus 
trade iin chinas 
history 
total trade rose 86 percent in 1989 to 1115 billion from 
january through june this year the 2565 billion in exports 
exceeded imports by 256 billion economists predict a 10 billion 
surplus for 1990 nearly double the record 1982 surplus of 563 
billion 
more industries produce goods for export because economic 
problems have shrunk domestic markets economists say china also is 
pushing exports in order to repay foreign loans many of which are 
due in 1992 
led by its freewheeling southern coastal provinces china is 
exporting more to the united states than ever before despite 
international censure of the harsh action against prodemocracy 
demonstrators in june 1989 
y japan is warming to 
communist china and lagging in help for the economically strapped 
soviet union 
japan invaded china and caused widespread death destruction 
and devastation former foreign minister saburo okita wrote 
recently recalling the occupation of china half a century ago 
japanese feel guilt about china not about the soviet union 
what may be a short march back to normal relations with beijing 
began when prime minister toshiki kaifu announced last month that 
japan will gradually restore a fiveyear package of loans worth 810 
billion yen 54 billion 
the loan program was frozen as part of international sanctions 
after the crackdown of june 1989 reports say it will resume this 
fall restoring japan to its role as the biggest source of foreign 
credit to china 
analysts say the economic benefit to japan of the restored loans 
could be limited although sagging trade could pick up if the 
chinese economy revives japanese businessmen are nervous about 
investing in a country whose political situation is unsettled 
in explaining japanese policy kaifu has said regional stability 
requires that china not be isolated historically japan has valued 
good relations with beijing as a counter to soviet influence 
because of the cruel japanese occupation of china during world 
war ii it is difficult for japan to continue protesting chinas 
human rights violations 
tokuma utsunomiya a member of parliament who heads the 
japanchina friendship society has pointed out that japanese 
soldiers killed many more chinese civilians than the peoples 
liberation army did on the night of june 34 1989 
for example more than 100000 civilians and prisoners of war 
were slaughtered in nanking then capital of china after the 
japanese captured it in late 1937 
debate about easing sanctions against china has been muted here 
compared with the loud criticism in congress of president george 
bushs decision to extend mostfavorednation trading status to 
beijing 
when a poor country is developing there may well be times 
when national unity and stability take priority over human 
rights okita wrote in an essay for the international herald 
tribune the former foreign minister is chairman of the institute 
for domestic and international policy studies in tokyo 
government officials also are keenly aware that china did not 
demand reparations for war damage which utsunomiya of the 
japanchina friendship society estimated at 50 billion or more 
japan has a responsibility to help chinas modernization 
because of the ruinous occupation utsunomiya 85 said in an 
interview this is different from the situation of the 
industrialized countries in the west 
japan is not the only nation warming to china indonesia 
restored full diplomatic relations this month and saudi arabia 
switched recognition to beijing from taiwan where the ruling 
nationalist party still claims to be the rightful government of all 
china 
even tension between taiwan and china has eased with growing 
business and civilian ties 
the change in japans attitude is particularly important because 
it is one of the democratic economic powers that agreed to impose 
sanctions 
among other signs that kaifus government wants better relations 
is a decision not to renew visas for vocal chinese dissidents 
living in japan the activists recently told western reporters the 
japanese were using them as pawns 
a japanchina investment promotion organization was formed in 
march with government support 
several former cabinet members have gone to beijing to meet with 
premier li peng about the impending economic aid and an official 
delegation flew to beijing in late july to work out details 
there has been speculation that top officials soon will visit 
china even though such trips would violate last summers agreement 
among leading industrial nations 
the japanese will find some method by which to restore 
highlevel contacts by early 1991 a western diplomat said 
utsunomiya believes japans resumption of aid will help improve 
the position of chinese who favor economic reform and are trying to 
recuperate from the conservative backlash that followed the 
crackdown on dissent 
i completely agree that china should develop democracy but 
right now the country is in a backward condition he said 
japan should first help china develop its economy and 
democracy can then grow from that base

late july george steinbrenner is still 
running the yankees the governor of louisiana is deciding whether 
to veto an abortion bill and the first tropical disturbance of 
summer a storm named arthur makes its appearance in the caribbean 
the american press seems bent on finding out who david souter is 
and what his thoughts are about abortion president bush has just 
nominated him to the supreme court 
few americans much notice that saddam hussein of iraq is 
accusing his small neighbors of harboring an imperialzionist 
plan to drive down the price of oil 
dont blame yourself if you missed the rumblings that were to 
suddenly put the united states on war footing and land a vast 
military force on the searing saudi desert where american troops 
had never before been welcomed 
what led to that the quarrel between iraq and its little 
neighbor kuwait just seemed like another of those wrangles over 
oil production and pricing that occur before the meetings of opec 
sheiks and statesmen 
oil wasnt there a glut 
war wasnt this the era of the peace dividend 
the oil glut was the problem for saddam hussein of iraq after 
eight years of war with iran ended by a ceasefire his country 
was powerful but broke oil prices and oil revenues were falling 
saddam found a pair of villains kuwait his wartime supporter 
and financier and the united arab emirates kuwait is just across 
the border the uae is tucked away on the other side of saudi 
arabia 
kuwait and the uae were in fact as saddam hussein charged 
exceeding their opec oil production quotas by over a million 
barrels a day and thus helping to keep oil prices depressed oil 
was bringing 14 a barrel 20 percent lower than the year before 
that was the background to the events that brought out the 
battleships the troops and the gas masks 
july 17 saddam uses the 22nd anniversary of the coup that 
brought his baath party to power to lay out his demands he wants 
kuwait to forgive 15 billion in loans extended during the 
iraniraq war and he wants kuwait and the united arab emirates to 
pay 14 billion to compensate for what he says iraq lost due to low 
oil prices 
if words fail to protect iraqis something effective must be 
done to return things to their natural course and return usurped 
rights to their owners he says iraqis will not forget the 
maxim that cutting necks is better than cutting the means of 
living oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them 
july 18 a letter from saddams foreign minister to the arab 
league accuses kuwait of having stolen 24 billion worth of 
petroleum over the past decade from an iraqi oil field along the 
two nations disputed border 
kuwait puts its 20000man army on alert 
july 19 kuwait cancels its state of alert it was all a 
summer cloud that has been blown away says an unidentified 
kuwaiti source who turns out to be monumentally wrong 
july 20 thousands of kuwaiti workers in iraq sensing trouble 
head home 
july 22 a progovernment newspaper in iran in a surprise show 
of support for a former enemy says a means of punishment against 
quota violators seems a necessity 
july 23 unconfirmed reports say that iraq has massed 30000 
troops to its border and that the pentagon has put its warships in 
the persian gulf on alert 
july 24 iraq accuses kuwait of stealing iraqi oil kuwait 
reinstates its alert the pentagon announces naval exercises in the 
persian gulf 
july 25 president hosni mubarak of egypt seeking to carve out 
a peacemakers role says iraq and kuwait have agreed to send 
delegations to the saudi arabian summer capital of jiddah to 
discuss their differences 
july 27 at a tense meeting in geneva opec agrees to limit oil 
production and raise its target price by 3 to 21 a barrel kuwait 
and the united arab emirates promise to abide by the new production 
quotas because of iraqs threats to use force against countries 
that ignore the limits industry observers expect the measure this 
time to stick 
in washington the house and senate defy bush administration 
opposition and vote for economic sanctions against iraq these 
reflect an accumulation of complaints over iraqs attempt to 
intimidate neighbors its human rights record its use of poison 
gas during the iraniraq war against its kurdish minority its 
drive to build nuclear weapons the state department says the votes 
will not be helpful to diplomatic efforts to modify saddams 
behavior 
aug 1 talks in jiddah start with an embrace but two hours 
later they break off the iraqi delegation walks out saying they 
did not sense any seriousness from the kuwaitis tensions and 
oil prices rise 
aug 2 7 pm edt aug 1 tankled iraqi infantry units storm 
into kuwait they advance unchecked down a highway across the flat 
desert terrain to the capital kuwait city 
the financial times says the advance is so unchallenged that 
some troops travelled down the road by bus the emir sheik jabir 
flees by helicopter kuwaits hopelessly outnumbered troops wage 
pitched battles around the sheiks residential palace the sheiks 
younger brother is reported to have been killed defending the 
palace 
kuwaits crown prince and premier sheik saad alabdallah al 
sabah goes on the radio and television and calls for resistance 
let them taste the chalice of death 
kuwait calls for urgent american military assistance but iraq 
threatens to turn kuwait into a graveyard if an outside power 
intervenes 
the invasion seems to catch washington by surprise but the cia 
takes the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it was not 
surprised and had provided policymakers with very useful and 
timely information 
president bush reacts swiftly first he condemns saddams 
naked aggression then he engineers a united nationssanctioned 
embargo of iraq finally he commits massive american force the 
largest dispatched since the vietnam war to protect saudi arabia 
from kuwaits fate he says they will serve until saddam withdraws 
from kuwait 
by now the story has captured americas attention the latest 
developments are writ large on the front pages

another crisis another round of demands for a 
national energy policy to insulate americans against recurrent oil 
shocks its all happened before 
by failing to learn from the lessons of history we are 
condemning ourselves to repeat it said sen lloyd m bentsen 
dtex arguing that there ought to be a law requiring emergency 
measures before oil imports hit 50 percent of us consumption 
its too late of course as bentsen noted 
imports were running at about 50 percent before the latest 
persian gulf crisis erupted with iraqs takeover of kuwait 
as in 1973 and in 1979 the united states faces rising oil 
prices and though theres no immediate prospect of those kinds of 
shortages they could come eventually the earlier oil shocks were 
major factors in triggering recessions the economy already is 
slowing and the current turmoil in the persian gulf can only make 
it worse 
despite what happened before and despite the virtual certainty 
that something similar would happen again us efforts at energy 
discipline were shelved for most of a decade ronald reagans 
energy policy was to leave it alone and let the market rule that 
sufficed while middle east oil was plentiful and relatively cheap 
now the problem is back 
we have spent the last decade basking in the glow of falling 
real energy prices sen albert gore jr dtenn said before 
the senate passed its energy policy bill early this month we 
have been lulled into a complacency that cannot last 
during the reagan administration the department of energys 
conservation budget was slashed by twothirds 
when imported oil prices fell in 1986 us production fell 
too at those prices many domestic producers couldnt compete and 
there was no incentive to keep going us oil production is down 
by about 20 percent since 1985 at 71 million barrels a day june 
production was the lowest on record 
remnants of the emergency programs that grew out of the crises 
of the 1970s have put the united states in better shape to deal 
with the impact of the persian gulf situation 
one of those legacies is the emergency petroleum reserve a big 
enough stockpile to temporarily cushion against shortages it could 
be a lot bigger if the government hadnt stopped buying during five 
of the reagan years a budgetcutting move that could prove 
expensive 
the 1987 tanker war in the persian gulf threatened oil supplies 
and us warships were sent to protect the supply lines that 
costly operation isnt calculated into the price of oil nor is 
this one they go onto the tax bill not the price at the pump 
sen frank h murkowski ralaska calculated that counting the 
cost of earlier military operations the true price of imported oil 
comes to 52 a barrel that hypothetical price tag doesnt include 
the cost of the massive us military buildup in saudi arabia and 
the persian gulf 
figured that way the price is soaring with the us military 
deployment in saudi arabia and the gulf this is not a freebie 
out there in terms of the expenditure president bush said 
tuesday saying he could not estimate the cost or the duration of 
the operation 
but people dont count those costs the way they count the cost 
of a gallon of gasoline 
oil imports are a major factor in the us trade deficit james 
schlesinger a former secretary of energy and of defense says the 
price will hit 75 billion next year swelling to over 100 billion 
a year by the mid1990s if past trends continue 
through it all us energy policy has shifted and drifted 
richard m nixons project independence made little headway toward 
the goal in its name jimmy carter said the quest to curb energy 
dependence was the moral equivalent of war his program of 
conservation and production incentives fees taxes and penalties 
didnt last long the reagan administration relied on the 
marketplace the bush administration still is at work on its energy 
strategy due later this year 
and as carter notes the arab oil suppliers know only too well 
that we now have no effective national energy policy nor any 
commitment to adopt one 
legislation to declare that oil imports of 50 percent represent 
a peril point for us security and to require emergency 
action to keep them lower is part of a new national energy security 
act passed by the senate just before its august recess two days 
after iraq invaded kuwait the timing was coincidental the bill 
was drafted primarily to deal with global warming not oil wars 
a measure seeking to restrain oil imports was defeated by the 
senate in 1987 after the last persian gulf crisis had subsided 
conservation production incentives and new technologies to 
develop alternative energy sources all have been components in the 
successive strategies that were shaped and shelved after the 
earlier oil shocks 
the department of energy put together a quickhit package of 
steps to boost production and promote conservation to offset the 
loss of imports from kuwait and iraq 
but between oil crises the tendency has been to act as though 
there wouldnt be another one

valley of 10000 smokes alaska ap they call this 
windscoured place hell with the fires burned out a desert of 
pumice and ash piled 700 feet deep by the most powerful series of 
volcanic blasts this century 
geologists continue trying to sort out the plumbing beneath 
novarupta volcano which erupted in june 1912 with a force 10 times 
that of the mount st helens explosion a decade ago 
for the last two summers a multiagency team of scientists has 
been ferrying supplies and equipment by helicopter in and out of 
this roadless and unique corner of the 4 millionacre katmai 
national park and preserve 
the area was established in 1918 by president woodrow wilson 
who set aside an initial 1700 square miles to preserve an area of 
importance to the study of volcanism 
scientists want to pinpoint the size shape and location of the 
eruptive vent 
it will help us predict eruptions find ore deposits and 
better understand the earths process said tom miller of the 
alaska volcano observatory in anchorage 
but because the science is being gathered in a wilderness area 
the project is not without controversy 
a dozen scientists were tiptoeing around this summer trying not 
to intrude on the wilderness experiences of backpackers trekking 
more than a dozen miles to the shelter of two ramshackle huts on 
baked mountain near where the volcano is believed centered 
men and women who spent years in classrooms and labs earning 
their doctorates spent several days on their hands and knees 
reroofing one of the huts as part of an agreement with the 
national park service 
the park service relaxed its rules for using a helicopter in the 
katmai backcountry in exchange for the work 
proposals to drill two holes deep into the body of the 
stillwarm volcano already have begun drawing fire although the 
environmental impact statement has not yet been written and public 
hearings are at least a year away 
i got a couple of letters about it critical of the drilling a 
few days ago said alan eliason katmais new superintendent i 
think they were written by people who used to work here 
when robert griggs first saw the valley that he appropriately 
named the valley of 10000 smokes the sounds were deafening as 
thousands of fumaroles or vents hissed and roared spitting steam 
and heat into the air 
the whole valley as far as the eye could see was full of 
hundreds no thousands literally tens of thousands of smokes 
curling up from its fissured floor said griggs who explored the 
ukak river valley in 1916 for the national geographic society 
the valley is silent now except for the wind and most of the 
fumaroles were extinct by the 1930s although hikers can warm their 
hands over a few small holes that emit odorless steam clouds near 
the novarupta vent 
there are a couple around here that go about 80 degrees 
fahrenheit john eichelberger chief scientist for the project 
said while guiding a reporter around 
except for several deep gorges and an endless number of gullies 
cut by glacial or snow melt into the tan brown and orange 
moonscape the 40squaremile valley appears much as it did after 
being cooked 78 years ago 
the scent of sulfur from nearby trident volcano drifts faintly 
on the wind as you stand surrounded by evidence of the fury of the 
eruption 
even the place names tell a story baked mountain broken 
mountain falling mountain knife creek 
all are the physical reminders of an eruption that spawned ash 
clouds so thick that they darkened skies over the atlantic states 
dropped summer temperatures around the northern hemisphere an 
average of 18 degrees and released acid rain on vancouver british 
columbia disintegrating clothes drying on lines 
half of the eruptive volume blew up sending ash into the 
atmosphere the other half with larger fragments blew a day or so 
later and went laterally eichelberger said 
it gases incandescent ash moved at about 100 miles an hour 
and built up hundreds of feet thick in only a few hours it came 
out of the ground at about 1500 degrees 
miraculously no one died in the explosions which were heard 
clearly in juneau alaskas capital 750 miles to the south 
it was an exceedingly large and as these things go 
relatively simple eruption eichelberger said 
normally volcanoes are built up from hundreds of eruptions 
over many years with katmai it was a single event thats what 
makes it so interesting to study 
scientists can interpret the magnetic and seismic results 
theyve collected over the two summers of work but they still 
cant see into the earth said miller 
we need to verify it he said and you can only do that 
with something a kilometer or more down and thats done with core 
drilling

tenyearold jimmy highbaugh took a running 
jump into the swimming pool at indian summer camp 
i like the swimming and food here he said then he blurted 
out with a wide smile im over my cancer it came back two 
times but im over it now 
jimmy who had hodgkins disease was among 59 cancerstricken 
boys and girls attending indian summer for a week this summer some 
had shaved heads and others had lost limbs 
but mostly it was like any camp where kids swim fish hike 
and act like kids 
its a chance for them to be pretty normal for a week said 
jack geil a diatric oncologist at the university of kentucky 
medical center 
most of the kids they see have the same cancers like they 
have he said they can relate to that theyre doing pretty 
much normal things the ones on therapy see others coming off 
therapy 
during meals geil helped give chemotherapy treatments 
the camp was one of four of its kind in the nation when it was 
started in 1982 by the lake cumberland district cancer council an 
advisory group of the mcdowell cancer network there are more than 
100 camps now 
campers are charged a 5 registration fee to attend the 300 it 
costs to send a child to the camp is raised through donations and 
special projects according to camp director gloria sams 
besides fun and games campers are taught to live with others 
to gain some selfconfidence and earn a degree of independence 
its hard to make excuses when the person sleeping next to you 
has gone through the same thing said sams 
the campers didnt complain 
i enjoy being around the counselors said lonnie johnson 
12 of lexington theyre fun youre always doing something 
youre never sitting around its a lot of fun 
the theme for this years camp was heroes and superheroes 
the children were welcomed on the first day by costumed fantasy 
superhero characters 
on day two they were entertained by animals from the cincinnati 
zoo and the national forestry service the star attraction was 
smokey the bear 
kentucky basketball coach rick pitino spoke to them the third 
day he brought along bernadette locke who was making one of her 
first public appearances as his new assistant coach pitinos

the level of saturated fat in pork 
declines if hogs are fed cooked soybeans but the meat tastes just 
as good as conventional bacon and chops researchers report 
the study was done by scientists at the university of illinois 
and at the harlan e moore heart research foundation of champaign 
they say this is another step toward designer pigs for 
consumers who want lean pork with less saturated fat than todays 
cuts 
the key is the diet of hogs who are fed whole soybeans 
processed through an extruder 
the feed produced pork with a significantly higher ratio of 
polyunsaturated to saturated fat a 50 percent improvement in pork 
chops and a 100 percent improvement in bacon 
we can produce healthier pork and do it in an economical 
way said dennis leszczynski a dietitian and food scientist at 
the heart foundation and there are no important differences in 
animal performance meat taste texture processing or storage 
peter bechtel a university meat scientist who worked with 
leszczynski on the project prepared a report on the findings for a 
recent meeting of the american society of animal science in ames 
iowa 
pigs are like humans were all a product of the kind of fat 
we eat said bechtel so we change the ratio of polyunsaturated 
fat in the pork by altering the fat that goes in the hogs 
the american heart association recommends that the ratio of 
polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat be 1to1 said leszczynski 
feeding extruded soybeans improved the ratio from 028to1 to 
043to1 in pork chops and from 025to1 to 050to1 in bacon 
he said 
a lean chicken breast has a ratio of 083to1 
were getting closer said leszczynski the challenge now 
is to see how much higher we can go without adversely affecting the 
meat quality or the economics 
it is a step in the right direction but a pretty small one 
said dean ornish director of the preventive medicine research 
institute and member of the faculty of the school of medicine at 
the university of californiasan francisco 
it is analogous to going from two packs a day to one pack the 
ideal is to decrease your total fat intake and this does not 
accomplish that he said 
the study involved 160 pigs some had a diet that included 20 
percent extruded soubeans for the six weeks before slaughter 
conventional hog rations contain corn and soybean meal the 
scientists substituted the extruded whole soybeans for the meal in 
order to retain soy oil which is relatively high in 
polyunsaturated fat 
research at the international soybean program at ui has shown 
that extrusion not only leaves the oil in the final product it 
also destroys the natural digestive inhibitors in soybeans 
bechtel said most illinois farmers already have soybeans an 
8000 extruder could be shared by a group of farmers 
some pork producers already deliver leaner animals to market by 
selecting breeds that have less fat and slaughtering them before 
they get too heavy that has created pork cuts that are 97 percent 
lean 
bechtel said his project showed that the composition of the 
remaining fat could be improved 
the final product may cost a little more to produce so the 
researchers said farmers will have to sell processors and consumers 
on the health value of their new pork to justify a higher price

sugar has little to offer in the way of nutrient value for its 
calories 16 per teaspoon sugar provides no vitamins or minerals 
that are essential to good health 
but is sugar one of the culprits in disease does eating too 
much sugar lead to obesity what is the role of sugar in the onset 
of diabetes 
take this quiz to see how your answers match up with those given 
by experts answer true or false 
1 people who eat a lot of sugar tend to be heavier than others 
2 excess sugar consumption can lead to diabetes 
3 sugar plays a role in the development of tooth cavities 
4 research has begun to implicate sugar as a risk factor for 
certain cancers particularly cancer of the colon 
5 reactive hypoglycemia a condition characterized by a sharp 
drop in blood sugar after meals affects a larger percentage of the 
population than was once believed 
6 sugar interferes with the availability of certain vitamins 
and minerals to the body 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
answers 
1 false overweight people actually eat less sugar than thin 
people according to epidemiological studies moreover the amount 
of sugar someone eats is not necessarily a determinant of whether 
he will gain weight obesity results from a variety of factors 
including lifestyle genetics and overall eating and activity 
patterns 
2 false sugar in itself does not contribute to the development 
of diabetes however it does aggravate the condition once it 
exists people who have diabetes have trouble keeping down their 
bloodsugar levels so eating products that contain a lot of sugar 
makes the problem harder to control 
3 true it is not possible to say exactly how great sugars 
role is in the development of cavities the form in which it is 
consumed makes a difference sugar in sticky substances is more 
problematic than sugar in fruit or fruit juices other factors 
such as the hardness of the tooths surface are also involved but 
the amount of sugar americans eat contributes to dental cavities 
thats because the bacteria that cause toothe decay feed on sugar 
sugar also increases the chance that periodontal gum disease will 
occur the more sugar a person eats the more likely it is that his 
gums will recede causing his teeth to loosen 
4 false no scientifically based data support the notion that 
high levels of sugar consumption increase an individuals risk of 
developing any type of cancer 
5 false although many people believe they have reactive 
hypoglycemia relatively few individuals suffer from this condition 
6 false scientists have discovered no convincing evidence that 
people who eat large amounts of sugar have trouble metabolizing any 
nutrients 
note taken as a whole these answers indicate that sugar 
appears to cause no direct problems besides playing a role in the 
developmnet of tooth decay but that doesnt mean that a healthy 
diet is consistent with the consumption of a lot of sugarfilled 
snacks and beverages since sugar contributes no nutrients to the 
diet its consumption should be limited to make room for foods with 
vitamins minerals and other essential nutrients

scientists may have found a potential 
natural ally in their effort to wipe out the imported melaleuca 
tree before it takes over the everglades a cankerproducing 
fungus found in dying trees 
widespread use of the organism must wait until scientists are 
sure it can be used safely and effectively said roger webb a tree 
pathologist at the university of florida department of forest 
resources 
scientists believe as many as 6 billion melaleuca are in south 
florida covering onefourth of the everglades and they could 
cover threefourths of the everglades by the end of the decade 
webbs work and that of his assistants along with tests by a 
laboratory in england have tentatively identified the fungus as 
botryosphaeria ribis he said 
the fungus widespread in tropical and temperate regions causes 
rot in fruit and cankers in the bark of trees ranging from avocado 
to elm spores are produced in lowlying areas during wet periods 
and are spread by rain and wind once inside bark the fungus 
spreads through wood cutting off the flow of nutrients and water 
leaves wilt and die as do branches above the canker 
since 1983 biologists have been killing the melaleuca by 
cutting into the bark and squirting herbicides into the wound they 
believe the gashes provided points of entry for the fungus and the 
stress from the herbicide made the tree more vulnerable 
melaleuca trees were imported from australia decades ago as a 
possible source of lumber but quickly got out of hand the smelly 
tree causes headaches and other allergic reactions and sucks four 
times as much water from the ground as the sawgrass it replaces 
a task force of federal state and local scientists recently 
began a 25year eradication program they say may cost up to 10 
million

canadian real estate and retailing magnate robert 
campeau shoved from the drivers seat of his own company may be 
down but few believe he is out of the picture in efforts to 
resurrect debtridden campeau corp 
the board of directors dumped campeau last friday declining to 
reappoint him as chairman and chief executive officer of the 
business he built from a small construction concern in 1949 into 
one of canadas largest companies 
he remains a member of the board of directors 
the flamboyant 66yearold campeau bit off more debt than he 
could chew when he plunged into the american retail market he 
gobbled up allied stores in 1986 for 36 billion and federated 
department stores including new yorks bloomingdales and richs 
of atlanta for 66 billion in 1988 
in january federated and allied filed for bankruptcy protection 
and were removed from campeaus control campeau corp reported a 
1989 loss of 174 billion and has debt exceeding 133 billion 
a tough spot surely but campeau has been down before and some 
feel he already may be plotting his comeback 
hes done a lot for his country and he may not be finished 
said george hitchman a member of the board and longtime campeau 
loyalist he said in an interview in the toronto star i guess 
when youre up people are with you and when youre down they kick 
you around thats life 
the removal of campeau does not herald any major shift in 
company strategy said campeau corp spokesman richard wertheim 
it appears at least in the short term that there arent any 
significant changes expected or planned in the way the company 
operates or who is operating it in terms of senior management 
said wertheim of course all this took place a couple of days ago 
and they are still discussing plans the board is going ahead with 
finding a permanent chairman and ceo 
the key point is that the changes made friday night did not 
suddenly change the financial picture of the company clearly the 
restructuring that has been underway will have to proceed there 
will be perhaps some subtle changes but no significant ones 
campeau lost control of his company when national bank seized 13 
million shares or about 35 percent after he defaulted on 150 
million in loans he has been trying to buy back the shares for 80 
million but apparently has not been able to come up with the 40 
million down payment 
that payment was due may 31 the bank announced a onemonth 
extension but since then neither the bank nor campeau has 
commented he also has shunned requests for interviews before and 
since he was booted from the chief executive job 
campeau reportedly had been under increasing pressure to leave 
because of his hardline position in renegotiating loans with his 
principal lenders edward j debartolo corp and olympia and york 
developments the company spokesman would not comment on the 
reasons for campeaus removal 
campeau corps strategy is to restructure the us operations 
under the chapter 11 bankruptcy protection process to sell a 
substantial portion of the companys real estate in canada and to 
reach an agreement on restructuring the debt with the principal 
lenders 
the plan seems to be progressing reasonably well wertheim said 
several properties have been sold in recent months raising about 
82 million principal creditors at least for the moment seem to 
prefer helping campeau corp get back on its feet rather than 
seizing assets 
campeau also owes 215 million to bank of montreal and 115 
million to bank of nova scotia in addition he owes 13 million to 
campeau corp and already has missed a 1 million payment

the manville trust fund once viewed as a 
watershed in the struggle to compensate tens of thousands of 
asbestos victims now finds itself maligned nearly out of cash and 
verging on extinction 
created in 1988 in manville corps bankruptcy court 
restructuring the trust has settled close to 24000 claims for 
more than 1 billion from people with lung cancer and other 
respiratory diseases 
but the trust faces 130000 more claims it cant meet it has 
paid only two thirds of the money for cases settled and is 
hemorrhaging cash to defend lawsuits in unresolved cases 21 
million from january through june a federal judge has frozen its 
spending and ordered its overhaul 
as judges nationwide craft a solution to the nations biggest 
product liability issue the manville trust is blamed for 
aggravating the asbestos mess 
it couldnt have been worse gita rothschild an attorney 
for several companies that made asbestos said wednesday the 
idea could have worked it was mismanaged 
trust officials deny they created its fiscal black hole they 
say it resulted from an unanticipated number of claims 
unexpectedly high settlements and quick resolution of early cases 
the trust didnt write the original script but we have been 
charged with carrying out what was ordained donald m blinken 
one of five trustees responsible for the washingtonbased 
operation said in an interview 
the trust has had no problem paying its claimants he said 
the trust simply has never been given enough money 
formation of the trust was supported by a wide majority of 
manville corp creditors plaintiffs lawyers representatives of 
future claimants codefendants and the company itself 
the trust is legally separate from manville which sought 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982 because of lawsuits over 
asbestos an insulation material that causes lung cancer and other 
repiratory ailments 
insurance payments and manville cash and securities made the 
trust worth about 3 billion but it now has only 153 million in 
cash well short of whats needed to pay previously settled claims 
a 375 million cash infusion from manville isnt due until august 
1991 
the trust owns about 80 percent of manvilles stock on which it 
relies as a guaranteed source of future income even it sold the 
stock today there wouldnt be enough money to pay pending claims 
lawyers assert 
though manville is protected from further lawsuits publicity 
about the trusts problems has helped push down manville stock to 
around 6 a share from over 10 last october 
criticism of the trust centers on the size and timing of 
payments to victims and on fees received by plaintiffs lawyers the 
bulk of trust money went to settle early cases not necessarily 
from victims whose illnesses required immediate attention 
the plan didnt say they had to pay an inordinate amount on 
the first 15000 cases said richard f scruggs a plaintiffs 
lawyer in pascagoula miss handling thousands of cases 
the trust tries to take credit for paying out quickly when 
they were paying it out without any regard to the number of future 
cases or their severity he said 
trust officials blame the reorganization plan which authorized 
settlement on a firstcome firstserved basis the bankruptcy 
judge in charge burton r lifland refused to limit fees to 
plaintiffs lawyers typically one third of settlements 
marianna smith the trusts executive director said the fees 
had nothing to do with settlement size an average of 43231 per 
claim to date compared with an estimated 25000 when the trust was 
formed 
but defense lawyers allege their colleagues on the plaintiffs 
side inflated settlement requests to make more money they say no 
one forced the trust to pay as much as it did especially when many 
early manville claimants had received money from other asbestos 
defendants 
is it in the plaintiffs best interest to tell their clients to 
take 25000 when they could bang manville over the head and take 
50000 rothschild said 
they dissipated the money in an unbelievably short period of 
time paying people who had already been paid with no regard to the 
post1982 and future claimants she said when we started 
seeing the payments out in the field it was no surprise they ran 
out of money when they did 
us judge jack b weinstein who ordered the trusts 
restructuring and a spending freeze due to expire sept 6 said 
this week he expects the trust to be combined with funds from 
asbestos companies who say they lack money to pay claims the money 
would be paid to victims in a classaction lawsuit 
in the meantime weinstein wants the trust to begin paying 
claims based on medical need an infusion of cash is expected 
possibly as a special dividend on manville stock or through the 
sale of some assets 
trust officials said they have proposed resolving asbestos 
claims for other companies in addition to manville to help clear an 
asbestos court backlog of 90000 lawsuits nationwide

low wages few unions and modest unemployment 
benefits give north carolina the best manufacturing climate among 
the nations industrial states says a study of business costs 
released today by an accounting firm 
north dakota is tops among the 21 lessindustrialized states 
according to the survey by chicagobased grant thornton 
the 11th annual survey showed a striking increase in 
manufacturers concern about the education level of their employees 
manufacturers are feeling the pinch of educational systems 
that produce workers who can neither read write nor perform 
simple arithmetic the company said teaching their employees 
such basic skills is a substantial expense 
education was second only to wages among the concerns tallied by 
the survey which used 1989 figures education ranked eighth in 
last years survey 
the 16 factors weighed by the study are mostly business costs 
that have some degree of changeability such as wages taxes 
unemployment benefits fuel and energy costs in addition to 
education it does not include such considerations as rail and 
highway transportation water supply nearness to raw materials and 
availability of markets 
the company said the study could be helpful to manufacturers in 
narrowing their choice of where to locate a plant 
but survey manager terry johnson acknowledged that the multitude 
of issues not addressed in the survey limits its usefulness in 
making any specific decision 
north carolinas no 1 ranking was followed by vermont largely 
because of the fiscal policies of the state and local governments 
wisconsin which had a good performance across the board and 
mississippi mostly because of its low wages and low 
stateregulated employment costs such as workers compensation and 
unemployment insurance 
michigan had the worst manufacturing climate among 
industrialized states the study said the state had the highest 
average hourly wages highest percentage of union workers and 
ranked high in unemployment and workers compensation benefits 
among the lessindustrialized states north dakota was followed 
by wyoming south dakota and nebraska montana had the worst 
manufacturing climate among the lessindustrialized states 
grant thornton assembles the factors it wants to consider by 
asking manufacturing associations economic development officials 
and state governors to rank a list of issues supplied by the 
company 
other than education the factor rankings have changed little 
over the years following wages and education the most pressing 
areas of concern were workers compensation and unionization 
the survey reported the average national manufacturing wage 
increased 33 percent from 10 in 1988 to 1033 an hour in 1989 
michigan had the highest average manufacturing pay at 1351 an 
hour mississippi was lowest at 803 
wyoming received the highest education ranking among all 50 
states louisiana was worst 
the level of education was rated by considering teachers 
salaries studentteacher ratios high school graduation rate 
state expenditure per student and per capita higher education 
spending compared with per capita income 
grant thornton said labor unions have been losing membership in 
each of the six years the company has collected this data the 
percent of manufacturing workers belonging to unions declined from 
2486 percent in 1988 to 2384 percent in 1989 among the 50 
states only florida unions showed an increase gaining 700 members 
it was a good year for industrial peace the company said if it 
werent for the strike at boeing co from oct 4 to nov 20 1989 
would have set a record for the least work lost through strikes 
during the years surveyed

the securities and exchange commission is 
considering changing its rules to make it easier for foreign banks 
and insurance companies to sell their securities here 
in a unanimous vote wednesday the sec decided to seek public 
comment on a plan to cut red tape that requires foreign banks 
selling securities here to register as investment companies with 
us regulators 
all that this rule does is to say the foreign bank or 
insurance company is exempt from the 1940 investment company act 
that it isnt an investment company said gene a gohlke 
associate director of the secs investment management division 
not only is registration as an investment company costly and 
lengthy but then once registered the 40 act imposes a lot of 
regulatory requirements he said such requirments include 
periodic reports on the composition of the board of directors how 
the company is financed and what related transactions it is 
involved in 
those requirements may be very difficult perhaps impossible 
for the bank to comply with gohlke said 
us banks and insurance companies already are exempted from 
registering as investment companies 
since 1987 39 foreign concerns have been granted similar 
exemptions by the sec through a timeconsuming process requiring 
agency review 
by issuing an acrosstheboard rule gohlke said the agency can 
save time and personnel 
it takes some time for the staff to work on these and if 
theyre all pretty much the same why go through the process of a 
oneonone exemption when we can put a rule out there he said 
gohlke said the change if approved by the four sec 
commissioners after a 60day comment period would not exempt 
foreign banks from disclosing pertinent facts about their 
organization and financing as required by federal law of all 
companies offering securities to the public

a reported boost in livestock production means 
shoppers will get some relief in 1991 from record high pork prices 
and pay less than this years reduced prices for poultry the 
agriculture department says 
beef prices however will rise slightly because increased 
production will not keep up with population growth the 
departments economic research service says in a 1991 forecast 
released wednesday 
the forecast says retail pork prices are expected to decline 1 
percent to 3 percent in 1991 from this years record level and 
poultry prices may be down 4 percent to 6 percent retail beef 
prices may gain only 1 percent to 2 percent 
the forecast was based on indications that farmers will increase 
production because of good prices this year 
in 1990 the report said retail pork prices are expected to 
climb an average of 12 percent from last year while beef prices 
gain 6 percent 
overall 1990 poultry prices which include broilers and turkeys 
were forecast to drop 2 percent as production rises this year 
looking at market prices for 1991 the report said choice steer 
prices may average 75 to 81 per hundredweight next year about 
the same as the 75 to 78 forecast for 1990 
hog prices for 1991 were forecast at 49 to 55 per 
hundredweight down from 53 to 56 predicted for 1990 broiler 
prices at 51 cents to 57 cents in 1991 would be down from 54 
cents to 57 cents forecast for 1990 
analysts said per capita consumption of red meat and poultry may 
rise about six pounds in 1991 from the record level of about 220 
pounds annually in 1990 and 1989 
increased uncertainty about the health of the economy and its 
impact on consumer spending for meats are of major concern to the 
livestock and poultry sectors as supplies rise and prices continue 
high the report said 
other factors cited in the analysis included the july 1 cattle 
inventory which was only modestly larger than a year earlier the 
second year of relatively static numbers 
producers are retaining 4 percent more replacement heifers 
this year the report added even if a larger proportion of 
these heifers calve in 1991 the increased calf crop will have 
little impact on beef supplies or cattle prices until 1992 
egg production is expected to continue this years modest gains 
in 1991 the report said consumption will probably be down about 
one egg per person this year and again in 1991 retail egg prices 
are down about 4 percent this year and probably will drop 11 
percent to 13 percent in 1991 as production increases

japan has taken a lot of criticism about its 
policy banning rice imports but an agriculture department report 
says tokyos wheat policies arent anything to brag about either 
the united states and many other nations are pushing for 
liberalized trade under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the current uruguay round of gatt negotiations is scheduled to 
conclude at the end of the year 
but japan like the european economic community continues to 
follow price policies that are not responsive to freemarket 
supplyanddemand conditions the report said these policies 
discriminate against wheat imports in favor of domestic production 
and may also inhibit domestic consumption 
the report included in a recent grain review by the 
departments foreign agricultural service said japans wheat 
imports have declined from a peak in 1975 despite continued growth 
in population 
this is partially the result of increased local production as 
farmers responded to wheat production subsidies initiated in 1974 
and doubled in 1977 and the availability of land diverted from 
rice production the report said 
that dramatically increased japans wheat area and boosted 
production five fold moreover the big subsidies were paid for 
mostly by profits from the sale of imported wheat to local flour 
millers at fixed prices well in excess of the world price the 
report added 
during this period the per capita consumption of wheat leveled 
off in the 1970s and declined substantially in the 1980s the 
report said that might have been encouraged by high wheat prices 
relative to other commodities 
in contrast red meat and poultry products have become 
relatively less expensive recently and per capita consumption has 
continued to increase the report said 
if the production subsidies and distribution quota systems were 
reduced or eliminated analysts said japans wheat imports might 
increase in the range of 700000 to 1 million metric tons per year 
from their current level of slightly more than five million tons

american farmers outraged by president 
carters 1980 grain embargo against the soviet union appear more 
willing to do their part in the export ban against iraq 
after all the wheat trade with iraq had already virtually dried 
up this year officials say moreover farmers are not being 
singled out 
i sense fairly widespread support among farmers when the 
embargo is acrosstheboard said dean kleckner president of the 
american farm bureau in park ridge ill if we said as farmers 
and ranchers we want out we would be viewed correctly as very 
selfish and were not 
until this year iraq was the 11thlargest market for us wheat 
and the secondlargest market for the midwests hard red winter 
wheat said karen fegley of the national association of wheat 
growers in washington 
the us department of agriculture estimated agricultural sales 
to iraq last year at 720 million out of total farm exports of 40 
billion sales were even smaller to kuwait which iraq invaded aug 
2 
even before the invasion iraqs relationship with us wheat 
exporters had been made tenuous because the united states cut by 
half to 500 million the credit extended to the iraqis for 
commodities purchases fegley said 
they have bought no us wheat this year she said the 
immediate impact of the embargo sort of puts the point on the 
exclamation mark for us 
in endorsing the trade sanctions against iraq the nations 
grain growers did an aboutface from a decade ago when they 
expressed outrage over carters embargo of grain exports to the 
soviet union after its invasion of afghanistan 
after the political fallout the carter administration indicated 
it would not single out food as an embargo tool said john oades of 
the us wheat associates office in portland ore 
previous embargoes were not sustained multilaterally oades 
said in other words the us ended up being isolated from the 
market and somebody else ended up taking advantage 
but if western europe and other countries join in the sanctions 
us wheat growers wont feel like global chumps he said the 
moment somebody breaks stride and begins to ship wheat growers 
would be upset that their resolve is being taken advantage of in 
the marketplace oades said 
when the united states imposed sanctions on iran in the late 
1970s american farmers lost a wheat market that had grown 
substantially over the previous decade said eric etzel director 
of the washington association of wheat growers in ritzville 
the loss of the customer of iran is something you live with 
etzel said i dont think there are any wheat farmers who 
supported what was going on with iran or who support whats going 
on with iraq 
anyhow said kleckner the iraq embargo merely opens up other 
markets for american farmers 
everything thats produced is sold if not this year you do 
it at least some point in the future weve never dumped wheat or 
corn or soybeans in the ocean he said 
the trade routes will be different but trade continues i 
think it is shortsighted to say this will be devastating to 
american farmers

a presidential advisory panel says the food 
and drug administration should rely more heavily on its own 
advisory panels in approving experimental drugs 
for patients whose diseases do not respond to available 
therapies new treatments on the cutting edge of science may 
represent the best standard of care it said 
the committee chaired by industrialist armand hammer a 
physician by training concluded that patients are willing to 
accept the risks associated with new and untried therapies 
but it said they can become more widely available only if the 
fda can be allowed and is willing to become more flexible in 
implementing such innovations 
among the panels findings 
the secretary of health and human services should establish a 
permanent policy and oversight committee to monitor the fdas 
regulation and approval of drugs and biologic therapies for human 
use 
expedited approval of cancer and aids drugs could result if the 
fda relied more frequently on the opinion of qualified experts 
serving on agency advisory committees 
the fda should consider modifying its current criteria for 
approval of new drug applications the present standard proof of 
improved survival might well be changed to include complete or 
partial positive responses in patients whose cancers have resisted 
all current therapies 
congress should give prompt attention to fdas inadequate 
resources staff and facilities 
the fdas advisory committee system for human prescription 
drugs should be fundamentally restructured with panels permitted to 
bypass intermediate staff and report directly to the fda 
commissioner the panels should have an independent staff and 
control their own agendas and priorities 
the panel also recommended that companies sponsoring 
experimental drugs have the option of paying the fda for outside 
review of the applications by qualified and unbiased experts in 
order to resolve the fdas problem of increasing responsibilities 
and decreasing staff 
at least one consumer advocate himself a frequent critic of fda 
procedures questioned the wisdom of effectively delegating more 
authority to drug companies 
to set up these outside extragovernmenta psuedoregulatory 
bodies is to ask for trouble said sidney wolfe director of the 
public citizen health research group industry directly or 
indirectly is not capable of regulating itself

used to be a penny bought a peppermint stick or 
your sweethearts thoughts a penny saved was a penny earned at 
least a penny was worth bending over to pick up 
today economics professor john palmer says the canadian penny 
is just a pain in the neck 
its a nuisance declared the university of western ontario 
professor behind a ban the penny movement 
it wears out your pockets we end up storing them in piggy 
banks and jars it takes up a lot of time in checkout lines they 
dont give us any benefits as consumers there is absolutely 
nothing good to say about the penny except nostalgia we should 
all keep some in our little jewelry boxes for nostalgia 
palmer began a lowkey campaign to ban the penny with an article 
in an economic newsletter newspapers picked up the story and 
palmer started getting attention mostly positive 
its a hot discussion and we are getting a fair number of 
calls says mike francis spokesman for the canadian mint 
but the campaign doesnt seem to have sparked much thinking on 
the subject at the finance ministry the mints boss 
we have done our job by alerting the ministers office that 
this topic is becoming warm francis said ultimately it boils 
down to a political decision 
a canadian penny costs more to make than its worth 
the canadian cent unlike its american counterpart is 98 
percent copper 15 percent zinc and 05 percent tin the american 
penny is more than 90 percent zinc and coated with copper 
mint spokesman francis says it costs the federal government 
between 125 and 2 cents to make a penny depending on fluctuations 
in metal prices and the size of the run the mint struck more than 
one billion pennies last year yet nobody really likes them 
palmers solution just get rid of them dont accept them any 
more round off prices to the nearest nickel or even the nearest 
dime the british got rid of the farthing and the halfpenny 
without big problems the french eliminated the centime whats the 
problem with abolishing the canadian penny 
one fear is that merchants will all round prices up rather than 
up or down to the nearest 20th of a dollar palmers response so 
what 
rounding up doesnt matter because we dont want the pennies 
anyway says palmer who answers his phone ban the penny 
you cant buy anything for a penny he says i havent 
seen a parking meter in years that takes a penny just dont take 
them when im in a store if the change involves pennies i just 
put them in the charity box at the register or flip them in the 
fountain at the mall 
in canada you cant even take perverse pleasure in clunking down 
a sackful of pennies in payment of a particularly distasteful debt 
under the currency act more than 25 pennies is not legal tender 
rats 
francis points out there are also other solutions such as 
changing the metal content of the penny or even going to a 
twocent coin 
the dollar coin known as the loonie was brought in only 
after demand grew over a 10year period 
we dont make anything that nobody wants says francis we 
wouldnt make them if there was no demand the banks buy money from 
us and keep it in inventory they use that money to supply their 
customers predominately in the retail sector as long as there is 
a demand for any type of coinage we are obliged to meet that 
demand 
it would seem the penny is in no immediate danger despite the 
efforts of john palmer 
as the toronto globe and mail mused editorially 
you try taking four pennies with you on a shopping trip 
figuring that guards you against receiving pennies in change but 
you inevitably find more pennies in your purse or pocket than when 
you started how does this happen do the coins breed in 
captivity

major oil producers on alaskas north 
slope said they will boost production from existing wells by 50000 
barrels daily by years end 
energy secretary james watkins outlined proposals in washington 
dc wednesday to increase both production and conservation to 
replace oil supplies lost when iraq invaded kuwait 
starting immediately we are accelerating well 
stimulation programs at prudhoe bay said paul laird a spokesman 
for bp exploration in anchorage 
rising oil prices in the wake of the iraqi invasion also have 
made it economically feasible to pump oil faster 
a barrel of oil that comes out of the ground tomorrow is going 
to do a whole lot more for us than it would have a few weeks ago 
said laird 
bp and arco alaska inc operate the giant prudhoe bay field 
for about a dozen companies with a share in it 
within a few months well stimulation is expected to add about 
50000 barrels of oil daily to the 16 million currently shipped 
from the north slope that plus other planned production increases 
should boost north slope output by 200000 barrels daily by 
mid1991 bp and arco said 
the quickened production will shorten the prudhoe bay 
reservoirs life only by a fraction officials said the field the 
nations largest will support oil production well into the next 
century at least another 20 years said laird

farley incs sale of a 61 percent stake in 
fruit of the loom inc indicates just how deeply the debt problems 
run in william farleys industrial empire experts say 
farley clearly does not want to part with this fruit of the 
loom stock and hes selling it in my opinion at a low price 
said lee tawes of oppenheimer inc in new york 
it just says farley is in a very difficult financial position 
and having a liquidity problem tawes said 
farley inc said wednesday it had sold 375 million shares of 
fruit of the looms class b stock for 431 million to land free 
investment ltd a corporation chartered in the channel islands 
between britain and france 
class b stock carries five votes per share as opposed to class 
a stock which has one vote per share 
company officials would not comment on the reasons for the sale 
analysts speculated farley needed cash to make a debt payment that 
was due wednesday 
farley inc said it sold the stake in the chicagobased 
underwear socks and sweatshirt manufacturer for 1150 per share 
which tawes said was very cheap fruit of the loom closed at 
1262 wednesday on the american stock exchange up 112 from 
tuesdays close 
the sale still leaves chairman william farley in control of 536 
percent of fruit of the looms shareholder votes according to a 
filing with the securities and exchange commission 
farley inc and william farley the companys majority 
stockholder have sold more than 11 million of fruit of the looms 
class a stock since march according to sec filings but they 
previously had sold no class b stock of which they owned all 152 
million shares 12 million by farley inc and 32 million by farley 
personally according to the companys proxy statement 
farley inc owned about 20 percent of fruit of the loom prior to 
the sale 
the class b stock automatically converted to class a stock upon 
the sale the company said in a statement 
farley is chairman of both farley inc and fruit of the loom 
one of the brightest performers in the stable of manufacturing 
companies he assembled during the past 15 years largely relying on 
debt financing 
some of farley incs financial troubles stem from its 
acquisition of the georgia sheetandtowel manufacturer west 
pointpepperell inc 
technically the 3 billion leveraged buyout was never completed 
because farley was unable to raise enough money to acquire the last 
5 percent of pepperells stock 
in march farley defaulted on 15 billion in debt and 
subsequently offered to give up a majority stake in pepperell if 
bondholders would agree to lower yields and deferred payments the 
issue has not been resolved

housing starts continued to plummet in july 
falling 26 percent to their lowest level since the last recession 
the government said today it was their sixth straight monthly 
decline 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 115 million units 
after falling 22 percent in june 
the july decline pushed housing starts to their lowest level 
since an annual rate of 114 million got under way in september 
1982 when the economy was about to emerge from the 198182 
recession 
the last time starts fell for six straight months was the 
junenovember period of 1981 
most analysts had expected a small increase in starts in july 
noting relatively normal weather mortgage rates that were falling 
into the single digits and falling inventories that could stimulate 
renewed building 
according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the cost of fixedrate 30year mortgages fell from 1006 percent at 
the beginning of july to 998 percent toward months end however 
rates had edged back up to 1008 percent by last friday 
inventories slipped from a 82month supply at the may sales 
pace to a 75month backlog in june helped by an 80 percent jump 
in new home sales 
the rate of housing starts in july remained below the 138 
million homes built in 1989 and the sluggish pace resulted in the 
loss of 51000 construction jobs last month for the first seven 
months of 1990 the building pace was 96 percent below the same 
period of 1989 
and few analysts foresee any surge in building for the remainder 
of the year given continued relatively high mortgage rates a 
slowing job market and consumer caution 
applications for building permits often a barometer of future 
housing activity also slumped down 26 percent to an annual rate 
of 108 million 
construction of singlefamily units fell 14 percent to an 
annual rate of 873000 units in july following a 13 percent 
decline a month earlier multifamily starts were down 65 percent 
to an annual rate of 275000 units after a 49 percent drop in june 
all regions except the west participated in the slump starts in 
the west jumped 87 percent to an annual rate of 317000 units 
but starts fell in the south down 67 percent to an annual rate 
of 498000 units they were off 55 percent to 225000 units in the 
midwest and 53 percent to 108000 units in the northeast

even a little alcohol can hinder pilots ability 
to fly and federal rules should bar them from taking the controls 
until at least 12 hours after their last drink two doctors 
recommended today 
in a report in the new england journal of the medicine the 
doctors both pilots recommended sharply tightening federal 
aviation administration regulations 
the weight of the evidence suggests that even small amounts of 
alcohol can have a profoundly negative effect on flight safety 
the doctors wrote 
under their proposed changes 
pilots would not be allowed to fly if their blood alcohol 
levels were more than 01 percent current federal rules allow 04 
percent in most states the illegal level of alcohol in the blood 
for drunken driving is 010 percent but five states california 
colorado oregon maine and utah have set the level at a a more 
stringent 008 percent 
they would need to wait at least 12 hours after drinking before 
flying the current bottletothrottle rule is eight hours 
flying would be prohibited within 24 hours of consuming five or 
more drinks or when hung over 
pilots would be quizzed about their knowledge of alcohols 
effects when taking licensing exams 
the rules were proposed by drs jack g modell and james m 
mountz of the university of michigan 
they also recommended studying the possibility of equipping 
planes with locks that require pilots to pass coordination tests 
before they can start their planes these devices require pilots to 
perform a brief task to check their reaction times and shortterm 
memories among other things 
the doctors noted that surveys have shown that between 10 
percent and 30 percent of pilots involved in fatal accidents caused 
by pilot error have alcohol in their blood 
they said that pilots may still perform poorly many hours after 
heavy drinking even though alcohol has virtually disappeared from 
their blood 
closing arguments were scheduled to resume today in the case of 
three former northwest airlines pilots charged with operating an 
aircraft under the influence of alcohol 
defense attorneys said wednesday in us district court in 
minneapolis that the pilots may have used poor judgment by drinking 
the night before a flight but their flying ability was not 
impaired

falling energy prices helped hold down the 
overall increase in consumer prices in july the government said 
today in what analysts believe will be the last moderate inflation 
report before the persian gulf crisis produces higher oil costs 
the labor department said its consumer price index rose 04 
percent last month despite a 07 percent drop in energy costs 
the overall july gain followed a slightly brisker 05 percent 
advance in june and a modest 02 percent rise in may it was a bit 
larger than the 03 percent expected by most economists and was 
regarded as a worrisome sign going into august 
it tells us that inflation was wellentrenched going into the 
oil shock while not horrendous it was very much a part of the 
scene said economist robert dederick of northern trust co in 
chicago 
the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait has sent oil prices 
spiraling since the government surveyed prices for todays report 
even without the oil shock inflation for the first seven months 
of the year was running at a 58 percent annual rate compared with 
46 percent for all of 1989 
also today the commerce department said housing starts 
continued to plummet in july falling 26 percent to their lowest 
level since september 1982 when the economy was about to emerge 
from the 198182 recession it was the sixth straight monthly 
decline 
despite weakness in housing persistent inflation leaves the 
federal reserve board little leeway to stimulate the economy with 
lower interest rates dederick said 
stock and bond prices fell after the economic reports were 
released the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks declined 
1931 points to 272896 in the first half hour of trading 
the labor department said the cost of shelter shot up 09 
percent the same as in june that accounted for half the overall 
increase in prices much of the cpi rise in shelter prices was 
attributed to a 51 percent increase in the cost of outoftown 
lodging 
food and beverage prices were up 04 percent the third 
consecutive increase but a far smaller one than junes 07 percent 
gain 
the price of fruit and vegetables rose 16 percent reflecting a 
322 percent jump in the price of bananas and a 171 percent gain 
in the cost of lettuce 
pork prices were down a slight 02 percent the first decline 
since september a period in which they rose 191 percent 
egg prices dropped 82 percent in july nonalcoholic beverages 
were up 09 percent while fats and oils rose 11 percent 
transportation costs rose 03 percent last month gasoline 
prices which had risen 25 percent in june fell 03 percent 
new car prices reacting to lackluster sales fell 03 percent 
the sixth consecutive decline but used car prices rose 07 
percent the largest gain since january 1989 
clothing prices fell 02 percent the third consecutive drop 
price increases for some fall and winter clothing only partially 
offset further discounts on spring and summer clothes 
medical care prices continued a long string of stubbornly high 
advances they rose 09 percent in july and were 92 percent higher 
than a year ago 
the cost of smoking aside from its health effects rose steeply 
in july up 27 percent after a 24 percent jump in june tobacco 
prices were 109 percent higher than a year ago 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories rose a 
brisk 06 percent economists often take that measure as a better 
gauge of underlying inflationary pressures 
that socalled core rate has stayed high largely because the 
weakening economy hasnt yet pushed unemployment up appreciably 
thus wages and the cost of services which make up 55 percent of 
the consumer index have been rising steadily 
the various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 
1304 in july that means that a hypothetical selection of goods 
that cost 10 in the 198284 base period cost 1304 last month up 
from 1244 a year earlier 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university predicted 
august prices would be up 07 percent overall because of the 
energy rise 
rarely have changing energy prices moved so rapidly through 
the pipeline to the consumer he said within hours of the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait prices were rising at the corner gasoline 
station as suppliers feared that consumers would exhaust available 
supplies 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch expects prices will 
feel the direct effect of the energy shock through november after 
that the question is whether the oil spiral will trigger an 
increase in prices of seemingly unrelated goods and services 
lingering upward pressure on the core inflation rate could 
persist in subsequent months but the net effect would be muted 
because economic weakness is likely to lead to compensating 
downward pressure on labor costs he said

stock prices dropped today after the government

economists expected

the markets the labor department said prices excluding the 
volatile food and energy sector rose 06 percent last month while 
overall prices rose 04 percent higher than the 03 percent most 
economists expected 
the department pointed out that the data was collected before 
the start of the mideast crisis which has sent oil prices surging 
the report also caused bond prices to fall sharply 
also today the commerce department said housing starts 
continued to plummet in july falling 26 percent to their lowest 
level since september 1982

more crude oil production might numerically 
offset most of the oil lost in the embargo of iraq and kuwait but 
environmental and political concerns could limit the us supply of 
gasoline industry sources said today 
world producers probably could increase their crude output by up 
to 35 million barrels per day by the fourth quarter said an 
executive with a major us oil company who spoke to reporters on 
condition that he and his company not be identified 
though that comes close to the 4 million barrels lost daily 
through the international boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti oil the 
extra crude would not necessarily accommodate us needs the 
executive said 
there are certain crudes and certain products and certain 
suppliers you cant turn to he said much of the oil would have 
to come from iran and libya which domestic companies would not buy 
in addition many refineries that could increase output are not

general electric cos aircraft engines 
division announced thursday it will eliminate 1500 jobs in its 
us operations by 1992 because of cuts in military defense 
spending 
ge aircraft engines based in this cincinnati suburb said 500 
people would be laid off by the end of 1990 at its evendale and 
lynn mass jet engine plants 
it expects the rest of the reduction to be accomplished by 
attrition through the end of 1992 at the two plants which produce 
engines for military and commercial aircraft 
the reduction will affect mostly salaried employees but also 
will include some hourly production workers ge aircraft engines 
spokeswoman paula kollstedt said 
about 47 percent of ge aircraft engines 68 billion in revenue 
last year came from military contracts that percentage is expected 
to decrease to 35 percent by 1992 the company said 
ge said its commercial jet engine business has a 20 billion 
backlog for delivery during the next several years 
unfortunately the increase in ges commercial engine business 
will not be enough to offset predicted cuts in military spending 
said brian rowe senior vice president of ge aircraft engines we 
regret that our existing workload is not large enough to support 
current employment levels 
rowe said the reduction is necessary to keep his division 
competitive as the united states reduces defense spending 
ms kollstedt said the number of layoffs and attrition losses 
could change depending on the companys continuing review of the 
situation 
this is our best estimate at this time she said 
the evendale plant is one of the largest employers in the 
cincinnati area with a workforce of about 18000 people ge 
aircraft engines employs 37250 worldwide 
united auto workers union local 647 which represents almost 
5000 production employees at the evendale plant said ge informed 
the union thursday morning of the job cutbacks charlie highlander 
vice president of local 647 declined comment

saudi arabia today called for an 
emergency meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to discuss how to deal with the oil market in light of 
the iraqkuwait crisis 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer said the kingdom along with 
other unidentified members of the cartel have asked for an 
immediate opec meeting to discuss a unified decision on dealing 
with conditions of the market 
no date or site for the meeting was announced 
the minister in a short official statement denied the kingdom 
had notified any of its customers of any cutbacks in oil supply for 
september 
earlier in the day the japanese foreign ministry said saudi 
arabia had notified us european and japanese oil companies of a 
15 percent to 20 percent cutback in its oil supply for the month of 
september 
the japanese officials said no reason was given for the reported 
planned cutbacks which followed reports that the saudis would 
boost daily output from 54 million barrels to more than 7 million 
barrels to offset the loss of iraqi oil being blocked by a 
worldwide embargo when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 it increased 
its share of the worlds oil reserves to 20 percent 
at the most recent opec meeting which concluded in geneva 
switzerland on july 27 the 13 opec ministers raised the target 
price of oil by 3 a barrel to 21 a barrel they also agreed not 
to exceed the production ceiling of 225 million barrels a day 
until the end of the year 
earlier this year the price declined to the low 16 range 
partly because crude output by opec and other producers was 
outpacing world demand 
prices began rising earlier this summer after the cartel reached 
an agreement to restrain production prices shot sharply higher 
after the invasion of kuwait on speculation that iraq might attack 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter 
at the opec meeting in july iraq accused kuwait and the united 
arab emirates of overproducing oil and thus driving down prices 
iraq which relies heavily on oil sales to keep its economy afloat 
used the dispute over oil and territory to justify its invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
takahiro nakamae of japans ministry of international trade and 
industrys petroleum planning department said earlier today that 
even if the report of the planned saudi oil cutback for september 
is confirmed it will have little effect on japans overall oil 
supply 
japan he noted has 142 days worth of oil in reserve 
japan has agreed to participate in a full trade embargo on iraq 
and kuwait which were supplying 420000 barrels a day or 11 
percent of japans oil imports japan is dependent on the middle 
east for nearly 70 percent of its oil virtually all of which is 
imported 
but nakamae said japan can offset the iraqi and kuwait oil and 
the reported planned cutback by the saudis by importing more oil 
from other sources

grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly 
mixed in lackluster trading thursday on the chicago board of trade 
as persian gulfrelated buying offset a persistently bearish tone 
in the markets 
a new round of warlike rhetoric from iraqi leader saddam hussein 
sent the stock market plunging and triggered sharp increases in 
crude oil and gold futures those events reignited inflation fears 
which lent support to the crop markets analysts said 
corn and soybean futures also were supported by talk of a 
possibility of frost in the northern corn belt monday night 
although analysts said the chances for frost in august were 
extremely slight 
selling pressure stemmed in part from a national weather service 
forecast predicting normal temperatures and rainfall in the midwest 
during the latter half of next week those conditions would benefit 
the corn and soybean crops in the region 
at the close wheat futures were cent lower to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 284 a bushel 
corn futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september 
at 249 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with 
september at 118 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower to 2 
cents higher with august at 613 a bushel

the federal reserves rejection of the merger 
of bank of new york and a connecticut bank holding company may be a 
signal that banks should build strong capital reserves analysts 
said thursday 
the central bank rarely rejects a bank merger however late 
wednesday it announced it had denied the application from bank of 
new york to acquire northeast bancorp inc which owns the union 
trust co of stamford conn 
i dont think theres any question that regulators are sending 
a very loud and clear message to the banking community capital 
is king said james j mcdermott jr an analyst with keefe 
bruyette and woods 
capital represents stockholders investment in a bank and acts 
as a cushion between losses and the governments deposit insurance 
fund 
the feds action comes a month after senate testimony from 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who said strong capital 
requirements are the best means of ensuring stability in the 
banking system 
bank of new york and northeast first discussed a merger seven 
years ago bank of new york with 464 billion in assets at the 
end of last year was the nations eighth largest bank according 
to sheshunoff information services of austin texas union trust 
with 35 billion in assets was the third largest in connecticut 
but the merger agreement reached in 1986 turned into a bitter 
dispute over what constituted a fair price for new haven 
connbased northeast northeast had placed its takeover value at 
about 500 million bank of new york which had concerns about the 
value of northeasts loans valued the company at 1956 million 
the disagreement led some analysts to speculate that the new 
york bank wanted to back out of the deal it also led northeast to 
file a breachofcontract lawsuit in may seeking 350 million in 
damages 
in its order denying the merger the fed noted capital 
adequacy is an especially important factor in the analysis of 
banking holding company expansion proposals it said capital of 
the combined banks would not be substantially above the boards 
minimum capital levels 
another factor in the rejection mcdermott said likely was 
weakening commercial real estate values in the northeast which are 
cutting into bank profits 
combinations in the northeast at this point in time are not 
being looked at favorably given the current economic outlook he 
said 
northeast chairman frank j kugler jr said he was deeply 
disappointed by the feds denial 
northeast has worked diligently and in good faith to attempt 
to consummate this transaction for the benefit of its 
shareholders he said in a statement 
he blamed the denial on bank of new yorks acquisition of irving 
bank corp saying that bank of new yorks capital position 
appears to have been substantially and adversely impacted by 
that deal 
kugler also said northeast is considering amending its 350 
million breachofcontract lawsuit to include additional complaints 
bank of new york issued a brief statement saying that in view 
of the feds decision the acquisition cannot proceed

the federal reserve bank of new york temporarily 
moved its fedwire electronic funds transfer system out of new 
york on thursday because of a power problem averting what could 
have been an unexpected bank holiday in the nations financial 
center 
the fedwire is the central banks funds and securities transfer 
service the principal means of transferring money between banks 
the new york feds fedwire branch is the nations busiest 
shuttling 900 billion worth of securities and funds among banks 
daily 
peter bakstansky a vice president of the new york fed said the 
power problem was an indirect result of a local blackout on monday 
which cut electricity to the fed office and many other buildings in 
the neighboring wall street area of southern manhattan 
the new york feds contingency system of dieselpowered 
generators had been operating the fedwire since the blackout 
but bakstansky said one of the generators began to falter 
thursday and fed officials decided to take the precautionary step 
of relocating the entire operation to an emergency backup site in 
pearl river ny a northern suburb that caused a slight delay in 
fedwire transactions he said 
it was a matter of reconnecting the banks to a new site he 
said we consulted with banks all through the morning and by 11 
am we were on line with securities transfers by 1115 we were on 
line with funds transfers 
he said if the new york fed hadnt opened the fedwire banks in 
the area couldnt have completed ordinary transfers of money and 
likely would have been forced to severely curtail operations or 
perhaps close for the day 
the pearl river location was an emergency site developed by the 
new york fed in 1987 in case such a power problem arose bakstansky 
said 
it was unclear how soon the operation would be able to return to 
manhattan he said

gold futures prices surged thursday on new yorks commodity 
exchange as a flurry of developments in the persian gulf triggered 
a rally in crude oil prices a dive in the stock market and a 
renewal of inflation fears 
on other commodity markets livestock and meat futures were 
mixed and grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures settled 620 to 690 higher with the contract for 
spot delivery up 660 at 40920 a troy ounce silver was 99 
cents to 10 cents higher with the spot august contract at 5168 a 
troy ounce 
the perceived safety of precious metals lured investors from the 
stock market as iraqi president saddam hussein unleased a new round 
of rhetoric 
hussein said he was praying for a peaceful resolution to the 
persian gulf crisis but that if a military confrontation erupts it 
could result in thousands of americans wrapped in sad coffins 
and in a development us officials described as unjustified and 
britain called grave and sinister iraqi military authorities 
in kuwait instructed all americans and britons to assemble at two 
hotels in the emirate 
pentagon sources disclosed plans to send 45000 marines to the 
reinforce thousands of us troops there 
meanwhile jordans king hussein denied reports he had carried a 
message from iraqs hussein to president bush diminishing hopes 
for a quick peaceful resolution to the usiraqi showdown 
the heightened tensions contributed to a 66point drop in the 
dow jones industrial average and a sharp rise in oil prices on the 
new york mercantile exchange reflecting dimming prospects for a 
resumption of iraqi and kuwaiti oil exports any time soon 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 92 cents 
higher with september at 2736 a barrel heating oil was 2 cents 
to 262 cents higher with september at 7547 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 18 cents to 341 cents higher with september 
at 8746 cents a gallon 
the rise in oil prices fed inflation fears which in turn 
supported gold 
the middle east crisis has given gold a shot in the arm but 
analyst fred demler of painewebber inc in new york said he was 
bullish on gold based on the markets supplyanddemand factors 
even before iraq invaded kuwait 
once the mideast situation blows over we think there will be 
a setback in gold prices but then we think theyll strengthen 
again based on other fundamentals he said 
livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange as cattle traders evened up their positions 
ahead of fridays monthly cattleonfeed report from the 
agriculture department 
the report is expected to show active placements of cattle onto 
feedlots and active marketings off of feedlots last month 
live cattle settled 10 cent lower to 12 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in august at 7847 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 05 cent lower to 20 cent higher with august at 8997 
cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent lower to 70 cent higher 
with august at 5757 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 2 
cents lower to 05 cent higher with august at 4895 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed in lackluster 
trading on the chicago board of trade as buying prompted by middle 
east tensions offset selling pressure stemming in part from 
forecasts for good growing weather in the midwest during the latter 
half of next week 
wheat futures settled cent lower to cent higher with 
september at 284 a bushel corn futures were 2 cents lower to 
1 cents higher with september at 249 a bushel oats were 1 cent 
to 1 cents higher with september at 118 a bushel soybeans were 
3 cents lower to 5 cents higher with august at 612 a bushel

energy sector rose 06 percent last month overall prices rose 04 
percent higher than the 03 percent most economists expected 
the department pointed out that the data was collected before 
the start of the mideast crisis which has sent oil prices surging 
the report also caused bond prices to fall sharply providing 
further weakness for stocks 
also the commerce department said housing starts fell 26 
percent in july to their lowest level since september 1982 
despite the weakness in housing economists said the bad news on 
inflation gave the federal reserve little room to stimulate the 
economy by lowering interest rates 
meanwhile iraqi president saddam hussein charged that president 
bush has lied to the american people about the middle east 
situation and warned there would be american deaths in the region 
if the united states continues to intervene 
also president bush met with jordans king hussein but 
afterward the king said he had not made up his mind about complying 
with a united nations embargo of iraq in addition the king said 
he did not carry a letter from the iraqi leader to bush as was 
previously reported 
the market was expecting something positive from the 
meeting said yuichi abe a vice president in the new york office

the dollar tumbled to an alltime low against 
the german mark during domestic trading as heightened persian gulf 
tensions and further signs of us economic weakness spurred a wave 
of selling 
gold prices benefited from the middle east instability rising 
660 an ounce 
the dollar was quoted at 15525 marks in late new york trading 
down from 1566 marks late wednesday and from 15645 marks tuesday 
the previous low in the modern marks 42year history 
the dollar also was sharply lower against the swiss franc and 
british pound 
as long as the us is involved in this crisis i think were 
going to find that the dollar is not the safe haven it once was 
during international crises said scott horwitz a vice president 
for foreign exchange trading with bank of boston 
after rising in overseas trading traders sold heavily in new 
york after a fiery speech by iraqi president saddam hussein that 
offered little hope of a quick end to the standoff over the 
invasion of kuwait 
that normally would give the dollar a boost but the weak state 
of the us economy has overwhelmed the currencys traditional 
attractiveness as a haven during times of international turmoil 
a government report that consumer prices rose 04 percent in 
july added to pessimism about the economys course and contributed 
to the selloff 
even though the tension may have escalated in the gulf the 
market is focusing on two trajectories in the us economy weaker 
growth and higher inflation said marc chandler a currency 
analyst with mms international in chicago 
weakness in the us economy eventually could force the federal 
reserve to reduce interest rates to avoid a recession just as west 
germany japan and other nations boost their rates to curb 
inflation 
the net effect has been to make the dollar less attractive to 
foreign investors but because of inflationary higher oil prices a 
fed interest rate drop now is considered highly unlikely for the 
present 
the rise in oil prices since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 was not 
reflected in the new inflation data 
in new york the dollar fell to 14725 japanese yen from 14765 
yen late wednesday earlier in tokyo it rose to 14790 japanese

other dollar rates as of 4 pm in new york compared with late 
rates wednesday included 12915 swiss francs down from 130735

guilders up from 17579 114975 italian lire up from 114575 
and 11477 canadian dollars up from 11435 
gold prices gained in response to apparently rising tensions in 
the persian gulf including saddams speech and the meeting between 
president bush and jordans king hussein gold is viewed as an 
attractive investment that can withstand times of crisis 
gold for current delivery rose 660 to 40920 a troy ounce on

shareholders in the 70yearold apparel 
manufacturer farah inc have voted to remove two officials from the 
board of directors including the son of the companys founder 
william f farah and charles wood were removed following a 
debate this year over who should control the company farah inc 
said thursday 
last week about 50 shareholders voted on the issue during a 
special meeting held at farahs request other votes were mailed in 
votes were counted by dallasbased ameritrust texas na and 
results were given to the company thursday 
farah the companys largest shareholder demanded that the six 
board members step down and that he be placed in charge of the 
company farah has blamed the board of directors for the companys 
recent losses including 116 million last year 
but board members say farah director and consultant for farah 
inc has interfered with daily management of the company causing 
467 million in losses over five years 
the power struggle intensified this year when board members told 
farah he was not sticking to a 365000 consulting agreement farah 
responded with a lawsuit and the proxy battle 
company chairman thomas wyman said the board tried to avoid the 
meeting but added mr farah is a determined person with a lot 
of convictions 
the results presented thursday indicate more than 75 percent of 
all shares represented and more than 55 percent of the outstanding 
shares were voted in favor of removing farah and wood 
we deeply regret that sincere efforts to dissuade mr farah 
from this proxy contest were not successful wyman said thursday 
in a prepared statement now that this special shareholders 
meeting is behind us management and the board can concentrate 
on returning the company to profitability 
the meeting was in the same week that farah filed for bankruptcy 
protection for his real estate investment business and an apartment 
complex he owns the drop in the value of farah inc stock and 
changes in tax laws led farah to file the chapter 11 petition in el 
paso earlier this month observers say 
the petition shows farahs debts to his largest unsecured 
creditors total 23 million

bad inflation news from washington and war words 
from iraqs saddam hussein combined to wallop the bond market 
thursday jacking up interest rates and depressing prices sharply 
in nervous trading 
the treasurys key 30year bond fell 1 2332 points or 1719 
per 1000 in face amount the bonds yield jumped to 892 percent 
from 876 percent late wednesday it was the highest yield since it 
flirted with 9 percent in early may 
economists said the bond markets deterioration began early in 
the day when the labor department said the consumer price index for 
july rose 04 percent considered an unexpectedly high increase 
that was the last measurement of inflation prior to the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 which has sent oil prices sharply 
higher strategists concluded the inflation rate will likely be 
even worse than previously thought when the effect of the oil price 
jump is calculated for august and beyond 
what youre looking at here are straight worries about 
inflation said lincoln anderson an economist for bear stearns amp 
co the cpi report was not a good one 
bondholders sell on bad inflation news which erodes the value 
of fixedincome investments and lessens the likelihood that the 
federal reserve will ease interest rates to stimulate economic 
growth 
there had been widespread predictions of a fed ease because of 
evidence the economy is so weak which tends to make bonds a more 
valuable investment but now many bond strategists fear the fed 
wont change credit policy for awhile 
the fear was aggravated thursday by the iraqi leaders vitriolic 
rhetoric against president bush and the united states in which he 
threatened to kill american soldiers and called bush a liar 
that suggested the persian gulf crisis could worsen and drive 
oil prices higher still thereby making the inflation outlook even 
more grim 
all the uncertainty surrounding iraq was a basic reason for 
what happened in the bond market said donald j fine chief 
market analyst for chase manhattan bank in new york 
kathleen camilli chief economist for maria ramirez capital 
consultants inc said she believed the gulf conflict would remain 
an underlying influence on bond prices indefinitely 
the bottom line is that to the extent we still have 
uncertainty in the middle east that will drive the bond market 
she said the economic numbers will take a back seat 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell point to point intermediate maturities fell 1 
point to 1 points and longterm issues fell about 1 points the 
telerate inc financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a 10 change in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer dropped 843 to 114550 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 773 percent as the 
discount rose 4 basis points to 749 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 785 percent as the discount rose 12 basis points to 
746 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 782 percent as the 
discount rose 12 basis points to 731 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8lsqb percent down from 8rsqb 
percent late wednesday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 1432 point the average yield to 
maturity remained unchanged at 745 percent

a us appeals court thursday directed a 
federal judge in cleveland to limit his effort to consolidate 
thousands of asbestos liability lawsuits from elsewhere in the 
nation 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
heard us district judge thomas d lambros argue for the right to 
consolidate the cases before his court 
lambros and nine other district judges from around the country 
last friday issued a blueprint for a national class action designed 
to more quickly resolve 90000 pending thousands of asbestos cases 
the plan ordered consolidation of cases in federal districts in 
norther ohio and east texas 
but thomas hermann attorney for allied signal inc of morris 
township nj asked the appeals court to prevent lambros from 
proceeding hermann said lambros lacks authority to consolidate 
cases from outside his ohio district 
hermann also argued that the 10judge group lacks authority to 
create a mandatory national class action hermann said such 
authority only belongs to the us supreme court and congress 
allied signal faces asbestos liability claims because the 
company produced brake linings and brake disc pads containing 
asbestos hermann said the company wants to handle those claims 
separately 
the appeals court did not immediately rule on whether to grant 
allied signals request 
but appelate judge boyce martin jr directed lambros to limit 
future orders to five plaintiffs who have filed requests with him 
to have their asbestos liability complaints certified as class 
actions 
lambros has issued a series of orders in the last month 
mandating creation of the national classaction for asbestos cases 
he also has directed parties from pending cases in cleveland and 
texas to attend a sept 14 hearing in cleveland to determine 
whether lambros should proceed with certifying the classaction 
lambros in an exchange with martin agreed that his orders 
should be interpreted only as official notices inviting plaintiffs 
to attend the hearing 
judge nathaniel r jones said the panel would issue a written 
order to define the courts ruling 
the federal judicial center reports that as of jan 1 there were 
29466 cases pending in federal courts in which claims are made for 
asbestosrelated personal injuries an estimated 60000 similar 
cases are pending in state court 
some companies that made asbestos products are encouraging 
consolidation eaglepicher industries inc of cincinnati is 
urging us district judge jack b weinstein in new york to 
consolidate thousands of cases in his court from companies who say 
they cant afford to pay their asbestos claims 
the plan by the 10 federal judges would give weinstein control 
over a class action for eaglepicher and five other struggling 
companies 
lambros would handle a class action seeking to reach a single 
settlement and us district judge robert parker in beaumont 
texas would hold trials for defendants unwilling or unable to 
reach settlement agreements

a state regulator told the casino 
control commission on thursday that donald trumps heavily 
leveraged real estate and casino empire is in danger of collapse 
the commission met here to decide whether to approve a rescue 
plan under which trump would use equity in his three casinos as 
collateral for new loans 
even if these agreements are approved they do not and 
will not end the financial difficulties of the trump 
organization said thomas auriemma deputy attorney general with 
the state division of gaming enforcement the organization is in 
dire straits 
the possibility of complete financial collapse for the trump 
organization is not out of the question auriemma said in his 
opening statement 
trump who attended the hearing was asked about financial 
documents released wednesday showing his assets market value as 
considerably less than his estimates the documents listed his debt 
as 32 billion against assets worth between 29 billion and 35 
billion 
i dont know if its a problem at all trump said i 
really dont know 
chief financial officer stephen bollenbach who was hired to run 
the organization on tuesday told the commission the organization 
could successfully shed its debt 
clearly things need to change in this company said 
bollenbach who formerly worked for the promus co i dont think 
that means were in dire straits but certainly somebody else 
might 
after trump missed a june 15 bond payment on the trump castle 
casino resort by the bay he entered into feverish negotiations 
with a group of seven banks the bankers agreed to an emergency 65 
million loan secured by equity in his three casinos 
attorney nicholas ribis said the agreement with the banks had 
been signed and been placed in escrow pending approval of the 
commission 
though ribis said the deal needs a quick decision acting 
commission chairwoman valerie armstrong said the commission would 
not be rushed into ruling on the complex restructuring 
ms armstrong asked trump attorney thomas cerabino who helped 
with the restructuring agreement if this were approved a week 
from now as opposed to in a day or two would the world come to an 
end 
quite possibly cerabino said 
final arguments are scheduled for friday 
a report submitted by the gaming division cast doubt on the 
ability of trump to meet bond payments due nov 15 on the taj mahal 
casino resort and others due dec 15 and june 15 
the report said the cash generated by those properties makes it 
unlikely there will be enough money to make those payments it also 
criticized the repeated management shakeups at the three casinos 
trump officials testified they have enough time to revamp the 
organization before the payments are due possibly through the sale 
of assets 
cerabino said the deal would bring order to trumps complicated 
finances and prevents dissatisfied lenders from setting off a chain 
of defaults by insisting on payment 
under the plan to restructure trumps roughly 1 billion in 
casino debt banks holding twothirds of the 65 million loan would 
be required to approve any move to declare trump in default 
cerabino said trump would have 20 days to persuade bankers not to 
do that 
trump would be in automatic default only if he declared personal 
bankruptcy cerabino said 
however several events could trigger consideration of a default 
including a deterioration in the financial health of major trump 
assets a suspension of trumps casino license or a legal judgment 
of more than 5 million against trump 
trump has been sued by the pratt hotel corp in an atlantic city 
property dispute the lawsuit seeks between 300 million and 700 
million in damages in addition bondholders of resorts 
international have set aside a 5 million legal fund to pursue 
possible action against trump stemming from his swap of resorts for 
the taj mahal 
the commission rejected a move by contractors owed more than 60 
million for work done on the taj mahal to participate in the 
hearing negotiations are continuing on some form of lesser payment 
on that debt said attorney john daniels

percent to 2699299 within the first 30 minutes of morning 
trading 
traders said market players dumped stocks as soon as the morning

letter from iraqi president saddam hussein for president bush

the market earlier this week adding over 1400 points to the 
nikkei index

unchanged from thursdays close 
the dollar was moving little as investors remained concerned 
about the middle east crisis and the slowdown in the us economy

securities co 
after rising in overseas trading traders sold the dollar 
heavily in new york after a fiery speech by saddam thursday that 
offered little hope for a quick end to the standoff over kuwait 
international crisis normally gives the dollar a boost but the 
weak state of the us economy has overwhelmed the currencys 
traditional attractiveness as a safe haven 
in new york the dollar fell to 14725 yen from 14765 yen late 
wednesday 
kanai said the dollar was getting weaker against the major 
european currencies because of pessimism over the us economy 
whereas the japanese yen was not rising much mainly because of 
the falling stock market

japanese government bond jumped to 8120 percent from thursdays 
close at 7985 percent the price fell to 8295 points from 8353

oil and gasoline futures prices moved sharply 
higher again thursday following more saberrattling by both sides 
in the middle east standoff 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude closed up 90 cents at 2736 per barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
crude oils recent rise had stalled earlier in the week on news 
that jordans king hussein would meet with president bush which 
gave rise to speculation that a peaceful solution to the persian 
gulf crisis might be in the works 
but early thursday iraqi leader saddam hussein gave a tough 
speech again attacking us intervention in the region calling 
bush a liar and reiterating warnings that his country was willing 
to battle the multinational force that has bolstered neighboring 
saudi arabia 
saddam hussein generated a lot of fear in the market said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc it showed he had a pretty hardline stance on the 
issue 
furthermore remarks by bush and king hussein indicated there 
had been little headway in reaching any type of settlement which 
helped boost crude prices further 
people chose to focus on what was going on with the two 
presidents calling each other liars said peter beutel a trader 
with merrill lynch energy futures it really doesnt bode well 
when you have two presidents calling each other liars like two kids 
in a sandlot 
hittle predicted oil futures will keep rising unless we get 
some firm news that saudi arabia is going to increase production 
throughout the week prices have been pushed and pulled by 
oftenconflicting reports about whether saudi arabia and other 
organization of petroleum exporting countries members would 
increase production to compensate for the oil embargo against iraq 
other energy futures traded on the merc also closed higher on 
thursday 
wholesale home heating oil for september delivery rose 262

the securities and exchange commission filed 
suit wednesday against imprisoned zzzz best owner barry minkow 
claiming he violated securities law in connection with his 
nowdefunct carpetcleaning business 
the federal complaint stemming from allegedly fraudulent 
financial statements filed with the commission in 1986 also names 
13 of minkows associates 
most of them have already agreed to permanent injunctions 
barring them from engaging in violations of the securities laws 
said sec attorney karen matteson 
the complaint alleges that minkow exaggerated the companys 
revenues so he could more easily sell stock in the firm 
the compliant says he attributed nearly half of zzzz bests 5 
million 1986 revenue figure and 86 percent of its 1987 first 
quarter revenue figure of 5 million to nonexistent insurance 
restoration business matteson said 
minkow raised 15 million by selling stock in the company 
matteson said 
the complaint also alleges that minkow lied on statements that 
showed the company had at least 2 million in assets so it could be 
listed by the national association of securities dealers inc 
automated quotation system the stock exchange known as nasdaq 
matteson said 
that listing makes it easier for the public to buy and sell 
your stock matteson said 
the purpose of filing the complaint is so the sec can prosecute 
on contempt charges possibly criminal if the defendants violate 
the injunction matteson said 
minkows attorney david kenner said he was surprised by the 
sec action 
theyre a day late and a dollar short in connection with this 
matter for failure for what they should have done a long time 
ago kenner said 
minkow 24 founded the carpetcleaning company in his parents 
garage when he was 15 years old he ultimately was charged with 57 
counts of securities credit card and mail fraud in connection with 
a scheme to bilk investors and banks of more than 100 million 
minkow was convicted last year and is serving 25year sentence 
at a federal prison in colorado a federal judge also ordered 
minkow to pay 26 million in restitution

the boeing co has agreed to pay more than 
500000 to an employee who claimed his leukemia was caused by 
exposure to electromagnetic pulse radiation during company tests 
the mans lawyers said wednesday 
robert strom alleged the aerospace company used him to test the 
effects of electromagnetic pulse radiation a blast of electrical 
energy created during a nuclear explosion 
strom was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1985 
and he blamed the illness on what he said was chronic exposure to 
emp from 1983 to 1985 
under the settlement boeing and a codefendant lovelace 
biomedical and environmental research institute will pay another 
200000 to support up to 10 years of medical examinations for 
more than 700 other boeing workers who joined in stroms 
classaction lawsuit said stroms attorney michael withey 
strom an electronics technician who worked on emp tests at 
boeing also alleged in his suit that boeing didnt tell him and 
other workers of potential health hazards of working with the 
radiation even though it knew there was a potential danger the 
suit later was expanded to include other present and former boeing 
workers 
boeing has said it tested the effects of emp on electronics in 
military aircraft and communications equipment it has denied using 
strom or anyone else as a human research subject 
under the settlement boeing admitted no liability and none of 
the allegations in the lawsuit boeing spokesman russ young 
declined to comment about details of the settlement 
medical authorities disagree on whether electromagnetic 
radiation can cause cancer or other health problems and what level 
of exposure might pose a risk electromagnetic fields are given off 
by many electric devices including power lines transformers 
video screens and home appliances but at far lower levels than the 
pulses from nuclear explosions 
the settlement was tentatively approved wednesday morning by 
king county superior court judge mary wicks brucker withey said 
brucker is to hear any objections to the settlement and decide 
whether to give it final approval at a sept 21 hearing
