the university of miami was voted national champion tuesday in 
the second narrowest voting since the associated press began its 
postseason college football poll 21 years ago 
notre dame coach lou holtz whose team finished second was one 
of those who had a better choice in mind 
you can justify why miami won it what you cant justify is 
why we didnt holtz said a day after the fighting irish defeated 
previously unbeaten and topranked colorado 216 in the orange bowl 
we played the toughest schedule we had the best record 
and we beat the no 1 team quite decisively holtz said in an 
emotional statement likely to renew debate over a playoff system 
miami won its third national championship in the last six years 
by beating alabama 3325 in the sugar bowl on monday night 
the hurricanes and notre dame each finished with one loss but 
miami beat the irish 2710 on nov 25 
there is no doubt in my mind that were the best team in the 
country miami coach dennis erickson said it just happens that 
it came down to two teams with one loss and we beat them 
miami 111 received 39 firstplace votes and 1474 points 
with notre dame 121 getting 19 firstplace votes and 1452 
points the 22point margin was the second closest since the ap 
began its postseason poll of sports writers and broadcasters in 
1968 
the other two firstplace votes went to no 3 florida state the 
only team to beat miami this season colorado fell to no 4 
miami also was chosen no 1 in united press internationals 
coaches poll and by usa todaycnn 
erickson said the close vote will increase calls for a playoff 
in college football 
the debate is going to go on until there is one i really 
believe down the road there will be a playoff system he said

a new years eve party at a hotel turned violent 
as drunken revelers threw potted plants and fire extinguishers from 
upper floors into the lobby at least 15 people were injured and 
about 50 arrested police said 
noboby knows what started it one minute it was fine and the 
next minute things were falling said a police spokesman who 
would not give his name 
in a charlotte nc hotel meanwhile hundreds of young people 
went on a new years rampage tossing furniture and other debris 
from balconies and windows authorities said the melee destroyed 
so much of a hotels firesafety system that officials evacuated 
the building for the night but no arrests or injuries were 
reported 
in atlanta about 2000 young people were partying in the 
1685room hotel police sgt rj lynn said 
you get the feeling these kids are spoiled irresponsible 
lynn said when you start tossing bottles off the 37th floor you 
could kill somebody 
guests reported there were fights they were hit with fire 
extinguisher blasts when they walked out of their rooms and they 
were trapped in elevators when people somehow managed to 
shortcircuit them 
theyre tearing the place apart henry hancock a telephone 
operator at the marriott said early monday theyre throwing 
chairs shooting fire extinguishers tearing up carpeting throwing 
plants and chairs over the railing this place looks like world war 
iii 
hancock said the hotel offered a special new years eve package 
deal and sold out its 1685 rooms but many of the younger revelers 
apparently brought friends into their rooms 
charges against those arrested in the melee at the 47story 
hotel included reckless conduct vandalism and assault most were 
between 17 and 21 years old 
paramedics said as many as 15 people were treated for injuries 
ranging from broken teeth to cuts on the head one was knocked 
unconscious apparently by a falling object 
brad bosworth a hotel manager said eight people were 
hospitalized and one was treated for a seizure which occurred in 
the hotels bar and was unrelated to the violent partying in the 
atrium 
bosworth said hotel officials had barely begun to assess the 
damage monday 
the hotels atrium was strewn with toilet paper beer bottles 
and cans overturned furniture and potted plants on several levels 
of the atrium garbage and pillows were tossed about 
in charlotte nc the disturbance at a howard johnson hotel 
was almost a riot charlotte fire department battalion chief 
arnold mullis said monday 
there must have been somewhere around 1500 teenagers he 
said they were out every window and on the balconies there were 
a couple of hundred of them in front of the building on the street 
we had to move our vehicles back to avoid being hit by flying 
debris beer bottles beer cans 
the youths threw hotel furniture from balconies and windows of 
the 11story hotel and some furniture landed in the swimming pool 
authorities said 
the teenagers also unwound fire hoses emptied all the fire 
extinguishers pulled smoke detectors from walls and broke the fire 
alarm system and fire officials decided to close the hotel until 
the fire protection system could be repaired 
there is no way we could have possibly left those people in 
that hotel with no way to even report a fire mullis said 
a hotel desk clerk who was on duty during the melee said he 
could not comment and the hotel manager was not expected in the 
office until tuesday the duty captain at the charlotte police 
department was out of his office early tuesday morning said a 
police official who answered the telephone there would not comment 
on the disturbance

plagued by rumors of drug use and facing a 
possible challenge from jesse jackson washington mayor marion 
barry is heading into an election season declaring he can still run 
the city and win a fourth term 
i am going to manage the affairs of the city and im not 
going to address these rumors and innuendoes barry declares 
weve received a lot of support and when the time comes to start 
campaigning we will be there 
polls however chart declining support for the mayor who was 
buffeted all year by personal and professional woes 
longtime friend charles lewis pleaded guilty to cocaine 
conspiracy charges and later testified under oath that he supplied 
barry with the drug the mayor denies any drug involvement 
barry gave reporters a brief look at his medical records after 
a television report that he had been hospitalized twice in 1983 for 
cocaine overdoses rather than the hiatal hernia reported at the 
time several medical experts said the documents appeared 
incomplete 
washingtons homicide rate soared to new heights in 1989 with 
police blaming drugs for more than 60 percent of the slayings law 
enforcement costs are climbing and the city faces the prospect of a 
second consecutive multimilliondollar deficit 
barry shrugs off his ties to lewis that doesnt bother me 
he says but the matter clearly has made his reelection campaign 
more challenging 
barry told top aides last week he has raised 250000 for the 
september primary and november general election he predicted he 
ultimately would raise 1 million according to sources 
but one of the chief challengers district council member john 
ray had raised nearly 250000 by sept 1 and when barry outlined 
his reelection plans he told top advisors he expects financial 
contributions from them 
it was the first time the mayor sought direct financial 
contributions from his staff according to an aide who asked not to 
be named the aide said barry campaign strategists told him they 
will need every dime they can get and from every source 
possible 
jacksons recent move to washington has fueled rumors that he 
will eventually enter the race for barrys job 
jackson denies that he will run against barry who fought 
alongside him in the days of the civil rights movement 
a number of polls have shown barry slipping over the past 12 
months and a majority of those contacted in a recent survey by a 
television station said they thought the mayor should resign 
four other candidates are vying for the democratic mayoral 
nomination and since the city has no runoff procedure the nominee 
could win with less than a majority of the electorate behind him 
theres a very real chance he could be reelected said max 
berry who ran barrys 1986 campaign but has since soured on the 
mayor his best bet is to have all these other people stay in the 
race if he wins the primary that could give him enough momentum 
for the general election 
normally winning the democratic primary is tantamount to being 
elected in washington where republican voters are scarce 
but former police chief maurice turner spurred on by the bush 
administration is preparing to run as a republican and holds out 
the prospect of appeal to black voters 
even if jackson gets into the race or turner mounts a serious 
campaign however no one expects barry to crumble under the 
pressure 
he is the consummate survivor says mark plotkin a 
political commentator and dc statehood party member nothing 
has happened to him yet and hes like a soldier who asks war is 
hell i havent been wounded

albanias leader ramiz alia vowed in a new 
years message to his nation to stay its socialist course and 
resist the upheaval that has toppled communist regimes throughout 
eastern europe this past year 
albania is europes last hardline communist state 
the events that have occurred recently in eastern europe have 
inspired certain known antialbanian forces to resume the campaign 
of slanders against our country alia was quoted as saying by the 
official ata news agency 
but as our people say they cannot succeed in doing us 
harm he was quoted as saying in mondays address the news 
agency was monitored in england by the british broadcasting corp 
alia appeared to be responding to a call by the pretender to the 
throne of albania leka i for his 3 million compatriots to rise up 
and overthrow the communist government 
leka i son of the selfstyled king zog i who ruled albania from 
1925 to 1939 urged an end to the tyrannical and atheist regime 
in a message sunday from south africa where he lives 
alia said his country is a society of justice that 
experiences neither social conflicts nor national oppression 
i am conscious that we have much to do in order to be 
transformed into a rich country he said but we are proud of 
being free and independent as we are sure that our future will be 
better and more prosperous 
alia claimed that since 1939 when the invading italian army 
ended king zogs reign every year in albania had been more 
prosperous than the previous year this year priority will be 
attached to the improvement of the peoples supply with food 
products and industrial and mass consumer goods as well 
but he added this would require hard work and economic 
austerity measures are demanded everywhere 
albania lying between greece and yugoslavia on the adriatic 
sea is one of the most isolated countries in the world with 
foreign visitors strictly limited and access to foreign broadcasts 
and books tightly controlled

the veterans affairs department says too few 
people are taking advantage of its most lasting benefit free 
burial in a national cemetery while at the same time va officials 
are planning for more space 
onethird of the nations 27 million living veterans dont know 
about the national cemeteries a va survey showed 
they just sort of forget about things many years after 
military service said jo ann k webb national cemeteries 
director she said the burial should be viewed as something 
theyre giving back to you in perpetuity for your contribution 
nonetheless the va expects the number of burials to increase by 
the year 2010 but the private cemetery industry says it believes 
the va is overestimating the number of future burials and it 
suggests limiting eligibility for burial in national cemeteries 
all veterans but those with dishonorable discharges may be 
buried in a national cemetery regardless of whether service was 
during war or peace 
also eligible are reserve rotc or national guard members who 
died on active duty surviving spouses who do not remarry and 
unmarried minor children 
the va prepares the grave site buries the dead furnishes a 
headstone or marker and a flag for the casket and provides 
perpetual care they are truly shrines webb said you get a 
real good feeling when you visit them 
the va does not however provide funeral arrangements 
transportation or military honors grave sites cannot be reserved 
veterans who choose burial elsewhere may receive a headstone or 
grave marker from the va veterans also may receive an american 
flag to cover their casket and a memorial certificate with the 
presidents signature 
the va buries about 10 percent of all veterans webb said and 
with the increasing age of the veterans population we are in a 
growth mode 
the median age is 674 years for more than 9 million living us 
veterans of world war ii while more than 100000 surviving world 
war i veterans have a median age of more than 92 years 
the number of va burials has grown more than onethird since 
earlier in the 1980s and should exceed 60000 in the year ending 
with september 1990 the va estimates burials will grow to 80000 
in the year 2000 and peak a decade later 
close to 2 million people have been buried in veterans 
cemeteries since abraham lincoln created the first 12 on or near 
civil war battlefields the number of cemeteries has grown to 113 
the burial operations budget has risen from 39 million in 
fiscal 1983 to 49 million this year although actual funding is 
expected to be 16 million less due to federal budget cuts 
a 1987 report by the va said that in the next few decades 36 
national cemeteries will have to join 47 that limit internment to 
relatives of people already buried there the same report 
identified 10 areas where the need for burial space would be 
greatest 
those are chicago the san francisco area miamifort 
lauderdale clevelandakroncanton detroit pittsburgh 
dallasfort worth seattletacoma albanyutica ny and oklahoma 
citylawton okla 
but the american cemetery association estimates there is enough 
existing private space for new burials for the next century 
executive vice president stephen l morgan said 
the veterans population is starting to diminish he said and 
as you turn the corner the veterans population goes down very 
quickly 
morgan said he would like to see va limit eligibility perhaps 
to combatera veterans and abide by the policy adopted in the 
1970s of having one national cemetery for each of 10 federal 
regions 
the american legion says it opposes any such restrictions on 
grounds people would be unfairly excluded and it has gone on 
record as supporting additional national cemeteries as needed 
the veterans of foreign wars also opposes restrictions and 
supports having a national cemetery in each state

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs upcoming 
visit to restive lithuania should provide new clues on the limits 
to use of military force by large powers an issue lingering from 
the us invasion of panama and the revolution in romania 
the question is how much a superpower in this case the soviet 
union will allow its perceived security interests to be 
jeopardized in the interests of allowing a small nation to 
determine its own fate 
or more specifically whether gorbachev will escalate from words 
to arms to persuade lithuania a soviet republic to remain in the 
soviet union 
using military force in lithuania or its sister baltic 
republics of latvia and estonia would jeopardize soviet relations 
with washington and president bush told gorbachev so at the malta 
summit on dec 23 us officials say 
administration officials are not saying what steps they might 
take if gorbachev intervened in the baltic republics but at malta 
bush promised to open talks on a trade treaty as a step toward 
conferring commercial favors on moscow scheduled a summit meeting 
in late july with gorbachev and has said work could be completed 
soon on treaties to cut nuclear conventional and chemical arms 
all that could be in trouble if things go badly for gorbachev in 
lithuania no date has been announced for the soviet leaders 
lithuanian trip which is expected early this year 
at the state department one official said our people will be 
looking very carefully at the gorbachev mission to lithuania to see 
how successful he is and what the prospects are for that 
republic 
questions concerning the use of military force however were 
clouded by the us invasion of panama 
gorbachev encouraged peaceful reforms among his eastern european 
allies poland east germany bulgaria czechoslovakia and hungary 
and he refrained from intervening when the tides of change became 
bloody in romania 
as the fighting heightened in romania the united states invaded 
panama with the stated purpose of replacing strongman manuel 
antonio noriega with a democratic government 
the difference is that the soviet union supports democracy by 
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to 
proceed secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters on 
dec 20 
in this one and very unique instance the united states did it 
by going in to assist a democratically elected government against a 
dictator baker said 
the united states has never recognized the soviet annexation of 
lithuania latvia and estonia during world war ii and bush told 
gorbachev at malta the united states would object to armed soviet 
interference with peaceful democratic and independence movements in 
the baltics 
in malta gorbachev told bush he did not intend to use 
military force to resolve the situation in the baltics said an 
administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
gorbachev also repeated his renunciation of the doctrine that 
past kremlin leaders had invoked to justify the use of force to 
crush reform movements in eastern european nations 
last week he underscored his unwillingness to intervene 
militarily in eastern europe as violent revolution swept romania 
climaxing in the execution of nicolae ceausescu who had ruled 
there for 24 years 
the lithuanian communist party announced on dec 20 that it was 
breaking with the main soviet party becoming the first 
republiclevel organization to do so since the civil war of the 
1920s 
lithuanian communists have endorsed calls by the popular front 
there to secede from the soviet union a right which is guaranteed 
by the soviet constitution but which gorbachev says would endanger 
the soviet union as a whole a lithuanian secession would prompt 
latvia and estonia and possibly other republics to follow suit 
today to realize the right to selfdetermination through 
secession means to blow up the union to set the people against 
each other and to sow conflict and blood and death gorbachev 
said in a speech on dec 23 
gorbachev appears to be drawing the line between reforms in 
eastern europe and reforms in the soviet union 
bush and baker have applauded gorbachevs reform efforts and 
say they want him to succeed 
baker moreover has told soviet officials that the united 
states would recognize the need of the soviet union to use force to 
restore and maintain order 
clearly however that approval would not countenance armed 
intervention in what so far has been a peaceful movement in 
lithuania latvia and estonia

nervous very nervous indeed he admonished them

before touring two military hospitals in san antonio to visit

service on sunday at a chapel on kelly air force base 
chaplain bobby thornton told the worshippers that he had written 
his sermon two weeks ago well in advance of learning that he 
would be preaching to the president 
thornton said he told friends he had no intentions of changing 
the sermon just because bush would be there 
but as it turned out i did change the sermon he said 
addressing bush directly i didnt do it for you mr president 
i did it for all these colonels sitting here 
he said that for one thing he cut its length in half that may 
have suited the array of colonels but one former general dozed 
through most of the sermon 
national security adviser scowcroft later sheepishly admitted he 
had trouble staying awake

the nations dairy cows are headed for better 
times in 1990 and so are consumers says the agriculture 
department 
food analyst ralph parlett of the departments economic research 
service says the retail prices of dairy products mostly milk 
cheese butter and nonfat dry milk may hold about steady or if 
there is an increase might average only 1 percent to 2 percent 
above last year 
that would compare with a 57 percent increase overall in the 
price of dairy products in 1989 the sharpest jump in years in 
1988 and 1987 for example annual increases were held to about 25 
percent 
parlett says much of the 1989 increase can be blamed on milk 
production declines caused by the poor quality of forage available 
for cows a carryover from the 1988 drought 
also there was a surge in demand for cheese at a time when 
inventories were low and export demand increased for nonfat dry 
milk 
economist james j miller writing in the usda agencys january 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine said the biggest change for 
dairy in 1990 is simply a return to more normal conditions from 
last years situation 
although the price declines from late 1989 will be dramatic 
1990 prices still will be higher than projections made a year or 
two ago he said 
miller said the fundamentals of the 1989 dairy market were not 
much different from what they were in 1988 
but the particular sequence of industry decisions and events 
in 1989 turned what might have been only a moderately tight market 
into a chaotic one with record prices he said 
miller said 1989 dairy prices would have been lower if 
cheese makers had been more aggressive about rebuilding 
inventory stocks in early 1989 
nonfat dry milk producers had been less aggressive about 
export commitments 
users had been more concerned about supplies or milk 
production had weakened earlier than it did 
miller said commercial use of nonfat dry milk in 1989 was very 
strong mostly because of the big exports some 350 million to 400 
million pounds after prices declined in the first quarter of last 
year exporters obtained extremely large commitments for the 
remainder of 1989 
these export commitments along with low commercial stocks of 
american cheese made the dairy industry unusually vulnerable to 
any slowing in milk production miller said commercial use of 
nonfat dry milk in 1990 will be smaller because of declining 
exports 
commercial use of cheese through september was up 5 percent from 
the same period in 1988 he said 
although retail cheese prices were not as high as in recent 
years continued economic growth and an end to usda direct 
donations boosted commercial use miller said cheese use later in 
1989 probably did not increase much because of sharply rising 
prices 
sales of fluid milk in 1989 was up 1 percent to 2 percent from 
1988 he said however sales of frozen products and cottage cheese 
declined and commercial use of butter dropped sharply in the first 
half of 1989 although sales may have recovered in the second half 
miller said milk production in the early part of 1989 was up 2 
percent from a year earlier in spite of the pressures of high feed 
costs resulting from the 1988 drought 
however milk per cow collapsed during the spring as supplies 
of dairy quality forage were exhausted and hay crops were delayed 
by cool weather he said output per cow has been below a year 
earlier since july evidence of substantial damage from feed 
problems 
the dips in milk output per cow and continued high culling rates 
kept the lid on total milk production after midyear although 
very high milk prices and slipping feed prices created ample 
incentive to expand output last fall miller said thus total 
1989 milk production may have been just slightly under the record 
of 1455 billion pounds of 1988 
forage quality and the extent of the mid1989 damage to cow 
productivity remain key uncertainties for early 1990 production 
miller said but if current incentives can stimulate 
production milk output in 1990 may increase 1 percent to 3 percent 
from last year 
feed grain and protein meal prices in 1990 will be lower he 
said during the first half of 1990 however milk prices will 
fall faster than feed prices the nowfavorable milkfeed price 
ratio and returns over concentrate feed costs will be 
substantially eroded by spring

when the federal government took its last 
census in 1980 it never counted brian upshur who was then 21 
years old homeless and staying in a rescue mission 
i knew about the census said upshur now head of food 
service at the los angeles mission but the census was always 
something you didnt want to be involved in the attitude was the 
government was trying to keep tabs on you 
in the 1990 head count the census bureau will try to do a 
better job finding gaining the trust of and counting homeless 
people one of the biggest groups missed by the last census along 
with blacks and recent immigrants 
the government plans to take steps like sending officials to 
parks and alleys where homeless people sleep and hiring the 
homeless themselves as census takers 
los angeles and other cities sued the government to implement 
many of the new procedures because of what all agree was an 
undercount in 1980 the census bureaus own estimates are that the 
government missed 46 percent of los angeles residents in the last 
census 
an accurate count is important because census data determines 
among other things federal funding for city and private programs 
and the number of elected representatives in congress and the state 
legislature 
but despite a massive effort by the census bureau and the city 
the homeless among the people who could most benefit by the 
government dollars and political representation that comes from the 
census will do their best to avoid being counted 
just finding many people will be a chore in los angeles seedy 
and dangerous skid row area and lesserknown neighborhoods 
frequented by the homeless gaining their trust long enough to fill 
out a census form or answer questions will be a battle 
ultimately the best we can hope to get is a guesstimate 
said cedric hinson a counselor at the los angeles mission i 
dont think we can presume that these things are going to be 
accurate 
the city plans to open its emergency shelters usually open only 
in bad weather on march 18 so the homeless will be available for 
counting 
city officials also are working with homeless shelters church 
groups and community activists to develop ways to get the word out 
about the census and to draw up a list of the likely spots census 
takers will find homeless people 
the census bureau will use the citys list of places to find 
homeless people as a road map when census takers hit the streets of 
los angeles march 20 and 21 
on the first night of homeless counting the census bureau will 
send people some of them homeless to organized shelters such as 
rescue missions and churches 
the second night will be a bigger challenge starting at 2 am 
unarmed and unguarded teams of census workers will search parks 
streets and sidewalks for homeless people census takers also will 
stand outside abandoned buildings asking people who come out how 
many homeless people are inside 
if a guy is asleep in a cardboard box then well just get a 
count his race estimate his age and move on said john reeder 
regional director of the census bureau 
the bureau purposely is shunning police escorts so the homeless 
wont be frightened away reeder said 
but even the governments best efforts dont guarantee a 
complete count 
upshur said that although homeless people are talking about the 
census this year especially because the government has offered 
temporary jobs to them as census takers interest is low 
youre not going to get a high level of cooperation upshur 
said it tends to be a bit scary for a lot of people

the revolutionary government began 
tackling the most hated legacies of dictator nicolae ceausescu by 
abolishing the death penalty disbanding the secret police and 
legalizing private property 
bucharest was quiet on monday with no reports of sniper fire or 
clashes between the army and diehard securitate secret police 
units hundreds of its agents were still believed armed and at 
large 
crowds dressed in black gathered on the capitals central romana 
square to light candles for relatives and friends who died in the 
twoweeks popular revolt that claimed thousands of lives as it 
brought down the ceausescu regime 
as the country celebrated its first noncommunist new years day 
in more than four decades interim president ion iliescu announced 
major governmental changes in a broadcast address to the countrys 
23 million people 
iliescu renewed promises of multiparty democracy with free 
elections in april and said he hoped 1990 will mark a genuine 
leap in romanias and the romanian peoples lives 
in the speech carried by the romanian news agency agerpres 
iliescu said the abolition of the death penalty underscored the 
popular and humanist character of the revolution 
referring to ceausescu and his wife elena who had been the 
countrys no 2 leader iliescu said the two dictators were the 
last personsthat deserved this fate 
ceausescus 24year despotic reign ended dec 22 and on 
christmas day he and his wife were summarily tried and executed on 
charges of genocide and other grave crimes 
the government kicked off legislative changes with a decree 
guaranteeing the right to repatriation of romanian citizens living 
abroad and allowing former romanians to regain citizenship on 
reentry to the country agerpres reported 
agerpres said exiles would have priority in buying housing with 
hard currency and could repatriate goods bought abroad without 
paying duties 
other changes announced by iliescu included the reestablishment 
of private property with farmers now permitted to buy sell and 
lease land and trade their produce privately 
iliescu a former communist who fell from favor for openly 
speaking his mind also said work would stop on romanias many 
opulent and wasteful construction projects undertaken by 
ceausescu that cost billions of dollars despite widespread poverty 
at home 
the interim president also disclosed agriculture production 
figures that showed last years cereal production amounted to 169 
tons way below ceausescus 60millionton claim 
to pay off the countrys foreign debt ceausescu had in recent 
years exported romanias best agricultural products while forcing 
rationing upon his people the new government is now opening up 
food warehouses to the people and is increasing energy allotments 
to permit warmer homes 
in a further apparent attempt to lay open ceausescus former 
personality cult to scrutiny tourism minister maj mihai lupoi 
said monday that he was considering opening the late dictators 
villa and its labyrinth of secret tunnels to tourists 
it will be a good lesson in history for people to see what 
happens when dictatorship comes to a country lupoi told a news 
conference

a newspaper publishes weekly car theft 
reports rental agencies warn customers theres a good chance their 
vehicles will be stolen and dealers make pitches for antitheft 
devices as they sell new cars 
these are among the precautions being taken in el paso where 
car thefts have increased 94 percent during the past two years 
it has gotten so bad that we go to the stores and my husband 
he used to walk around the shops with me now when we go shopping 
he stands by the window and watches the car said mary vallez 
who had a 7monthold car stolen from her driveway before dawn one 
day in 1979 
organized auto thieves make nocturnal sweeps of the city with 
shopping lists of the cars they want most often americanmade 
models such as fords or chevrolets for which parts are available 
across the border in mexico 
when we arrest a suspect they have told us that for that 
night they have a list of the types of cars to steal two of these 
one of these said police chief john scagno 
to find out what models are most popular with thieves in a given 
week and how many cars are stolen from a certain neighborhood 
residents can check a graphic printed each week in the el paso 
times 
through the first 11 months of 1989 4861 cars trucks and 
other vehicles were stolen in el paso said lt arturo flores of 
the police auto theft division 
thats a 10 percent increase over last year on top of an 84 
percent leap in the number of car thefts from 1987 to 1988 flores 
said el paso lost 986 vehicles per 100000 population compared 
with a national average for major urban areas of 713 flores said 
the per capita car theft rate is higher in nine other texas 
cities dallas had the worst rate with 2393 vehicles stolen for 
every 100000 residents in 1988 according to the texas association 
of vehicle theft investigators 
but theft victims in el paso are less likely than residents of 
other areas to recover their stolen cars primarily because they 
disappear over the border police said 
our recovery rate is terrible thats what makes our vehicle 
thefts unique scagno said ten minutes more or less after the 
car is stolen its in another country its crossing the border 
before its owners even know its stolen 
el paso police recover half of stolen vehicles compared with 
about 90 percent nationally about 60 percent to 70 percent of 
those recovered are found in mexico flores said many are found as 
far away as mexico city 
several suspected thieves are juveniles hired by organized rings 
across the border flores said one 17yearold suspect told police 
he was paid 500 to 700 per stolen vehicle 
the increasing rate of thefts in el paso has residents on edge 
were like a big town with smalltown insights so when you 
say 100 cars a week have been stolen thats startling said len 
schermer owner of accessory choice a car accessories business 
that sells antitheft devices 
he said his sales of security devices such as steeringwheel 
locks flashing lights alarm systems and automatic engine 
shutoffs are up 70 percent over last year and now make up 20 
percent of his business 
residents and city officials are fighting the thefts on several 
fronts but so far results have been mixed 
at least 300 vehicles have been registered in a new program in 
which owners paste stickers on a car that allow police to stop it 
without cause and question the driver the program is called bat 
for beat auto theft 
police set up temporary checkpoints at the border to try and 
catch stolen vehicles going into mexico although thefts went down 
during those periods they shot back up when the checkpoints were 
dismantled because they caused traffic jams 
and another police crackdown on auto thefts in june apparently 
made little impression on thieves they stole a pickup truck 
belonging to a deputy police chief who was leading the crackdown

striking coal miners welcomed a 
tentative settlement of their bitter 9month walkout at the 
pittston co but promised to keep the picket lines up until 
theyve had a chance to vote on the pact 
nobodys celebrating yet said leo carden a union strike 
captain in mcandrews ky after leaders of the united mine workers 
and pittston announced the agreement monday in washington dc 
if ratified by the companys 1700 workers the agreement would 
end a sometimesviolent strike that spread far beyond one small 
company at one point triggering wildcat sympathy strikes by 46000 
miners in 10 states 
details of the tentative accord between pittston and the united 
mine workers were kept secret until the union could explain the 
deal to its members in virginia west virginia and kentucky they 
will vote on the pact in the next eight to 10 days said union 
president richard trumka 
trumka and pittston chairman paul douglas praised the agreement 
that emerged from marathon holiday bargaining sessions under the 
guidance of a federal mediator 
but some idled miners reserved judgment until they see the 
details including provisions on the sensitive issues of health and 
retirement benefits several union leaders said miners would keep 
walking picket lines 
i noticed they used the word tentative when they announced 
the agreement said howard green a umw international board 
member from the unions district 17 based in charleston they 
will stay on the picket line unless notified otherwise 
as far as picketing goes were taking it as just another 
day said roger nelson a strike coordinator in west virginia 
the principal issue in the strike that began april 5 was 
pittstons attempt to end its contributions to the umws 
industrywide retirement fund 
pittstons coal subsidiary pittston coal group inc said it 
couldnt afford to continue payments to the fund which covers 
130000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976 pittston has 
just 560 retirees covered by the fund 
the union in the most recent stand made public insisted on 
continued contributions to the fund fearing that if pittston quit 
paying it would lead to wholesale departures by coal companies 
at a washington news conference with the mediator former labor 
secretary wj usery trumka predicted the pact would heal the 
strikes wounds we can continue to try to scratch each others 
eyes out or we can accept a relationship where we can grow 
together 
pittstons douglas added we think weve met the essential 
objections of all those concerned 
the strike was marked by mammoth labor rallies vandalism and 
rockthrowing confrontations between strikers and other company 
employees the union faces fines totaling 635 million for 
violating court orders limiting picketing and other strike 
activities 
after the settlement was announced miners who been getting by 
on 200 a week from the union strike fund gathered at a union hall 
in castlewood va cried quietly and hugged each other 
this started out as a strike and ended up as a labor 
movement said virginia miner jack bartee 
at the slab fork mine near logan wva monday night was like 
many others during the strike despite the announcement from 
washington 
a handful of miners warmed themselves over homemade stove built 
from the rims of coal truck tires music blared from a portable 
radio as they played cards and drifted in and out of the picket 
shack 
there are a lot of ifs and ands and buts in the contract 
said terry collins a miner from chapmanville wva if its not 
what we want were willing to stay out for another nine months

its an old world market with a new world 
neighbor and the regulars are worried about its survival 
maxwell street where raggedy peddlers have hawked their 
gadgets for more than a century likely will take its final bow in 
the 1990s city planners say the victim of blight and an ambitious 
university looking to expand its campus 
the market takes up several square blocks about two miles 
southwest of the citys expanding downtown most days it includes 
some 100 stores as diverse as homers outdoor sock stand and nates 
delicatessen 
good buys in here dolly one merchant said on a recent 
weekday as he beckoned customers in to sample his wares 
every sunday morning the number of merchants balloons as 
vendors set up shop on the sidewalk out of pushcarts or on the 
backs of pickup trucks bargain hunters flock to the seedy 
outoftheway outdoor bazaar which started in 1870 
the markets legendary melting pot still boils jewish merchants 
work side by side with blacks koreans and pakistanis 
mr lees restaurant chop suey breakfast delivery stands a 
short distance from slotkowski polish pork chops 
but the street always grimy has gotten grimier in recent 
years now its gleaming neighbor the university of illinois at 
chicago says it is time the market moved on if only a small 
distance so the school can expand by right of eminent domain 
to say that maxwell street is the icon that it was is flying 
in the face of reality university spokesman dennis church said 
its nothing now its sunday morning hang your product on 
the fence or search for a tire on the pile its not the market 
of its rich past its a sinkhole now 
the universitys student body has grown by several thousand to 
25000 in the past five years 
school officials want to build a new library and other 
facilities on a 31acre tract that encompasses the market church 
said much of the property including some vacant land already 
belongs to the city 
recently the citys commercial district development commission 
redesignated the area from commercial to institutional to let the 
university buy land from the city said commission chairman fidel 
lopez 
the citys planning commission and city council still must ok 
the proposal 
lopez and church agree that the market in some form must be 
allowed to continue both also agree its future lies somewhere 
beyond its current boundaries perhaps just across the street from 
where it is now 
but merchants and residents interviewed recently said they like 
it as it is most dont want to be relocated 
they say theyre going to replace us here replace us there i 
dont want to be replaced said delicatessen owner nate duncan 
a merchants organization has been formed to fight relocation 
and some grassroots activists loosely associated with the greens 
ecological movement have taken up residence to organize the 
markets motley population 
the merchants are notoriously jealous of each other but 
now its a matter of survival said mike metz owner of kellys 
sporting goods 
for helen mcgregor a 78yearold homeless woman who has spent 
her life on the streets around the market there may be nowhere 
else to go 
mcgregor spends her nights with other homeless people sitting on 
stools in a rundown mexican restaurant courtesy of its proprietor 
the owner has been so kind so helpful she said i 
wouldnt be here now if it werent for him

an emancipation day celebration held on the heels 
of a series of racially motivated bombings went off without a 
hitch but protesters outside the naacp headquarters in baltimore 
denounced the civilrights group 
theres a group of black americans who are under the illusion 
that we have arrived that we have achieved and that there is no 
longer a need for our civil rights organizations the rev rl 
white said monday at the naacpsponsored event in an atlanta 
church sometimes it takes a rude awakening some demented mind 
will plant a bomb somewhere just to let us know the fight isnt 
over yet 
in baltimore a handful of people some carrying placards 
denouncing the national association for the advancement of colored 
people picketed the organizations national headquarters and 
shouted antinaacp slogans new years day 
a sign carried by one of the pickets said bomb benny an 
apparent reference to naacp director benjamin l hooks the offices 
were closed new years day 
we are taking it seriously when people go to this extent where 
they come out and physically demonstrate against you with their 
hate signs said naacp spokesman james d williams 
meanwhile the fbi said it hasdetermined the kind of explosive 
used in shrapnel bombs that killed a federal judge and a 
civilrights lawyer 
i think were making some progress william hinshaw special 
agent in charge of the fbis atlanta office said monday he 
declined to provide details of the explosive 
killed in last months bombings were 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert vance and robert robinson of savannah a black

the vietnam war ended 18 years ago but the 
wounds of isolation borne by nowhomelessexsoldiers reopened 
easily as they watched a new movie about one of their own 
our wounds are still hurting us said ben colon 36 after 
watching born on the fourth of july 
i believe that we gave the best years of our life veterans 
should never be homeless said colon who was shot in vietnam and 
now must walk with a cane 
colon and earl beddoe 41 have been on a liquid diet since dec 
17 as a protest for better conditions at the nations first 
homeless shelter for veterans a facilityrun by the salvation army 
in queens 
they hugged each other after emerging late sunday from the film 
about a wounded veterans struggle to cope 
its touching you remember how you felt towards vietnam and 
the way you came back and the memories of the way you were before 
and how you can never be again colon said 
nearby was 43yearold howard fogelman who proudly wore his 
us ranger button on a cap as he spoke matteroffactly about 
being shotseven times during two toursof duty in vietnam 
the vets praised the movie saying they identified with its 
portrayal of the isolation felt by veterans returning from the war 
but unlike reallife vet ron kovic played by tom cruise who 
leads antiwar demonstrators and finally feels at home by 1975 
colon and beddoe and their colleagues are still waging their own 
war for dignity in america 
they feel they are losing 
at the queens shelter the veterans have curfews and other rules 
they say are better suited for children than former us 
servicemen some of whom have emotional wounds even though bullet 
wounds have mostly healed 
fogelman has a large dent in his face where a bullet entered 
and no teeth as a result of the shooting his last set of false 
teeth wore out two years ago and he says bureaucratic red tape has 
blocked him from replacing them 
withoutteeth he has remained jobless and homeless it has a 
lot to do with your confidence he said you dont want to 
talk 
drugs prescribed during his recovery from the facial wound led 
to a drug habit at home he said hes now in a methadone program 
and he suffers from posttraumatic stress which for him means 
you could just be sitting and you see images coming on the bus or 
the train 
he returned home to new york in 1967 he said to a completely 
different country 
it seemed they were protesting everything especiallythe war 
it was pretty bad coming home im not bitter now in this country 
youve got to do for yourself fogelman said 
norman siegel executive director of the new york civil 
liberties union said he felt angry after watching the movie and 
hearing kovic say he felt he was home again 
i dont think these guys feel theyre back home yet they 
still have not reconnected he said 
its an outrage that theres not enough services and resources 
for the homeless veterans siegel said that ending is 1976 and 
its now 14 years later were beginning the 90s and youve got 
hundreds of thousands of people who are homeless and hundreds of 
homeless vets perhaps thousands and its not only in new york 
city but in cities across the country 
the veterans are asking for a say in the operation of the 
shelter where 400 veterans stay they say they are treated without 
compassion by the staff and note that only two of 80 salaried 
employees are homeless veterans they are asking for job training 
and homes 
were not going to disappear said william dickensl 33 
he pointed to the hunger strikers who look weaker each day 
those two guys over there are on a hunger strike and theygre 
out here just to see this movie to know that somebody else 
cares he said

of them in front of the building on the street we had to move our 
vehicles back to avoid being hit by flying debris beer bottles 
beer cans

1685room marriottmarquis hotel when the bash turned violent

next minute things were falling said a police spokesman who 
refused to give his name 
guests reported there were fights they were hit with fire 
extinguisher blastswhen they walked out of their rooms and they 
were trapped in elevators when vandals managed to shortcircuit 
them

earthly way you could get out claude talley 62 said monday 
we became captives hostages 
henry hancock a telephone operator at the marriott said the

the communist party newspaper pravda and the 
governments nightly tv news began the new year with a new look 
in what might be called a madison avenue image makeover pravda 
on jan 1 unveiled a new simplified masthead that removes emblems 
of three awards and replaces them with a sketch of the newspapers 
founderl vladimir i lenin 
an editors note said the change was the first to the dailys 
masthead since 1972 and emphasized that the removal of the award 
emblems did not mean editors were not proud of them 
the word pravda which means truth in russian now appears 
larger and the bust of lenin shows him looking to the left above 
the phrase the newspaper was founded may 5 1912 by vi lenin 
the slogan workers of all countries unite remains atop the 
masthead but the heading communistparty of the soviet union 
hasbeen removed so the only identification of the publisher is a 
note organ of the central committee of the cpsu communist 
party of the soviet union 
also mondayl the newscast vremya which means time debuted a 
new studio set the previous set had anchors sitting at a long desk 
in front of a wall the new set was a desk in front of a window of 
a control room with television monitors and tv workers visible 
in a message to readers published today pravdas 
recentlyappointed editorinchief ivan t frolov said his 
reporters will try to be closerto the people and give up old 
stereotypes 
frolovl who in october replaced viktor g afanasyev a 
conservative who had been in the job since 1976 also promised the 
newspaper will open itself to discussion expression of dissent 
socialist pluralism of opinionsn 
the changes reflect the newspapers new leadership and the 
overall spicing up of soviet media under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs glasnost or openness campaign 
many soviets consider pravda dull and the paper has lost 
circulation steadily while other more investigative publications 
have grown in january of last year pravda had 97 million 
subscribers and by october 93 million 
traditionally the newspaper is dominated by long government or 
party announcements and other official business such as texts of 
speeches

eastberlin ap newly elected presidentvaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia today made his first trip abroad in two decadesto 
an ally that has also cast off communist rule and gave hesitant 
endorsementto german reunification 
he said a peaceful democracycan be as large as it wantsn 
havels comments at a news conference concluding his first 
foreign visit as head of state reflected the concern of germanys 
neighbors over emergence of a powerful and dominantnation in 
central europe while acknowledging that one germany is likely in 
the continents near future 
it is more important that germanymaintains a democratic 
consciousness than whether it has 60 million or 70 million 
people havel told a packed conference hall after his meetings 
with east german communistpremier hans modrow and interim 
president manfred gerlach 
as long as it remains peaceful and democratic it can be as 
large as it wants havel said 
a reunited germany would have about 76 million citizens and an 
even stronger economy than west germanys already the most 
powerful in europe 
germany has been both the cause and the resolution of 
europes most significant problems and again poses the most 
extraordinary importance to the future of europe havel said 
gerlach a liberal democrat who like havel rose to powerafter 
popularreform movements ousted the communistsfrom monopoly rule 
hasurged closer relations and strongertreaty tiesbetween two 
sovereign german states 
havel who wasnamed president on friday also planned a meeting 
later today in munich with west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
president richard von weizsaecker 
both havel and gerlach praised the direction their bilateral 
relationsare taking and havels acceptance of the kind of 
reunification sought by kohl and otherconservative west germans 
appeared not to trouble hiseast german host 
havels visitto east germany lasted only five hours but he metm 
with the two politicianswielding the most influence in shaping a 
new nation 
east germanys grassroots movement for democracy ousted an 
aging and orthodox leadership in october giving encouragementto 
those yearning for similarchanges in czechoslovakia 
havel espouses a sharper turn awayfrom communism than east 
germanygs interim leaders and his new years message was gloomy 
and critical in contrast with the attempts by modrowand others to 
soften the harsh realitiesof price hikesand currencyreforms 
likely to result this year 
east germanys official adn news agency said the czechoslovak 
presidentalso planned tripssoon to hungary poland and austria

estimates of the death toll in 
romanias bloody revolution vary from hundreds to tens of 
thousands and the provisional government has yet to announce a 
final official figure 
as the first sketchy witness accounts began to trickle out of 
the western city of timisoara where the uprising began in 
middecember the death toll was first estimated at hundreds then 
thousands 
then the revolution spread to other areas in transylvania and 
finally to the capital bucharest toppling president nicolae 
ceausescu on dec 22 
fighting escalated in the streets that day with security forces 
loyal to ceausescu battling the army and young revolutionaries and 
estimates of the dead rose 
at one point last week a report set the number at up to 80000 
but days later french health officials were told about 700 had 
died 
a red cross spokesman in geneva today said initial estimates of 
the death toll were far too high juerg bischof a spokesman of 
the genevabased organization said the red cross was unable to 
give a revised estimate of the death toll but that visits to 
hospitals throughout romania suggested the initial figures were too 
high 
one western diplomat said monday that he had information that 
indicated about 7000 people had died our best estimate is 
nowhere near what the government says he said 
before the fighting ended the revolutionary government blamed 
ceausescu for more than 60000 deaths but didnt make it clear if 
the figure covered the revolution or his 24 years of power 
initial reports from witnesses and citizens in timisoara where 
security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators dec 17 set 
the death toll in the hundreds then appeared to concur in 
estimates of between 2000 and 4500 
at one point there were estimates that 12000 people were 
killed in timisoara more than 7000 of them reportedly executed by 
the security forces after being detained 
but western journalists returning from timisoara and other 
cities in the region where heavy fighting had been reported said 
they doubted those figures and thought the total likely would turn 
out to be much lower 
on dec 22 the day ceausescu tried to escape the capital by 
helicopter from the roof of his palace us diplomats said they 
saw 13 people killed in bucharest but east european news agencies 
reporting out of bucharest before western reporters were able to 
enter the country said hundreds had died 
the following day dr marian palaschivescu said he alone had 
counted 54 bodies and an austrian pilot said he counted 30 bodies 
at the airport after fierce fighting on dec 24 ninety bodies were 
counted that day at just one of many morgues in the city 
the east german news agency adn reported that the provisional 
government estimated that 5000 were killed in only two days of 
fighting 
on christmas day hungarian radio cited authoritative 
sources as saying 70000 to 80000 had died and 300000 were 
injured 
but victor ciobanu the health minister under ceausescu but now 
a backer of the provisional government said that day that 500 had 
died in bucharest over the previous four days of fighting 
the day after christmas romanians in bucharest began preparing 
to bury their dead and 200 freshly dug graves were counted in one 
cemetery 
french health officials were told this week that 746 people had 
died in the revolution but western diplomats estimated from 
witness accounts and their own assessments that some 10000 people 
had died

has died of a stroke a government member said today he was 68 
cornelieu bogdan died late monday said sergiu nicolaescu a 
film director and member of the national salvation front leadership 
that has sought to run the country since the hated dictator nicolae 
ceausescu was deposed 
nicolaescu told journalists that bogdan was a man of honor 
and a very close friend 
earlier a stepdaughter svetlana hoge who lives in washington 
had reported the death and said it was believed bogdan had died of 
an aneurysm

telephone from bucharest and that her stepfather had a history of 
heart trouble

1969 through 1977 he returned to bucharest and was out of 
government for a time but later was named to a post in the foreign 
ministry that gave him authority over western hemisphere relations 
she said 
mrs hoge said however that there was friction between her 
father and the government of ceausescu and that he again left the 
ministry and was placed under what amounted to house arrest 
she said he was allowed to travel to washington in 1988 on a 
woodrow wilson fellowship and that he remained in the united states 
until a month ago 
bogdan was born nov 5 1921 into a jewish family in bucharest 
mrs hoge said he enrolled in the polytechnical institute in that 
city but was forced to halt his studies by the coming of fascism 
and world war ii she said he joined the communist party at about 
that time 
besides mrs hoge survivors include his widow emilia bogdan 
and two daughters olga bogdan of washington and illeana popa of

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home improved slightly in november due to 
steady declines in mortgage interest rates and a slight increase in 
family incomes 
the national association of realtors said its index rose to 
1058 in november meaning that a family with a median income of 
33482 had 1058 percent of the income needed to buy a 
medianpriced existing home costing 93000 
the median means that half of the families earn more and half 
less or that half of the homes sell for more and half for less 
the index was the highest since last february when it 
registered 1067 it was 1055 in october 
the realtors said the median price for existing homes increased 
400 in november but this was offset by a decline in mortgage 
rates from 1016 percent in october to 1012 percent in november 
and by an increase in family incomes from 33365 to 33482 
the association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixedrate 
and adjustablerate mortgages 
the changes increased the monthly principal and interest payment 
on a median home by 1 to 660 in november which represents 236 
percent of the median familys income 
the drop in rates generally is having the most impact in areas 
where housing is affordable for moderateincome buyers nar 
president norman d flynn said 
firsttime buyers continued to have difficulty producing 
sufficient income for starter homes however 
the most recent firsttime home buyer affordability index for 
the third quarter of 1989 showed that on a national basis 
firsttime buyers had only 71 percent of the income needed to buy a 
typical starter home

here are excerpts from the new 
years day address delivered by president vaclav havel on the eve 
of his first visit abroad to east and west germany 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for 40 years you have been hearing from the mouths of my 
predecessors the same thing in different variations how our 
country is flourishing how many more million tons of steel we have 
produced how we are all happy and how we trust our government and 
what beautiful future is opening in front of us 
i assume you have not proposed me to this office only to have me 
lie to you as well 
our country does not flourish the great creative and spiritual 
potential of our nation is not used in a meaningful way entire 
industrial branches manufacture things that evoke no interest 
while we lack things we need a state which calls itself a workers 
state humiliates and exploits the workers 
we have spoiled our land rivers and forests and we have 
today the worst environment in europe adults in our country die 
sooner than in the majority of european countries 
the worst thing is we live in a morally spoiled environment we 
have become morally sick because we have gotten used to saying one 
thing and thinking another we have learned to believe in nothing 
not to pay attention to one another mind our own business only 
phenomena such as love friendship compassion humbleness and 
forgiveness have lost their depth and dimension 
the old regime armed with its proud and intolerant ideology 
degraded man to the level of a work force and nature to the level 
of an instrument of production it turned the gifted and 
sovereign people running their country in an ingenious way into 
little screws of a monstrously big rattling and stinking machine 
we are all although understandably each one to a different 
degree responsible for the operation of the totalitarian machine 
none of us is only a victim we are all at the same time its 
cocreators 
we must accept this heritage as something that we have inflicted 
upon ourselves 
all around the world people wonder where did the subservient 
humiliated skeptical and seemingly disbelieving citizens of 
czechoslovakia find all of a sudden the amazing strength to shake 
off the yoke of a totalitarian system in a couple of weeks in such 
a decent and peaceful way 
without changes in the soviet union poland hungary and german 
democratic republic east germany things that happened here would 
hardly have happened and if so they would not have such a 
beautifully peaceful nature 
the fact that we have had good international conditions for our 
revolution does not mean that soembody was directly helping us 
over these past weeks 
our first president said jesus not caesar today this idea 
is alive again i dare say we even have an opportunity to spread it 
further and bring in a new element to european and world politics 
if we want to our country can permanently radiate love longing 
for understanding power of the spirit and the idea this radiation 
can be exactly what we can offer as our specific contribution to 
world politics 
we are a small country and yet we were the spiritual crossroads 
of europe once why couldnt we be the same once again wouldnt 
that be another contribution with which we can repay to others the 
help we are going to need 
i want to be a president who will speak less and work more a 
president who will be permanently present among his fellow 
citizens listening to them carefully 
i dream of a republic that is independent free and democratic 
a republic with economic prosperity and social justice briefly a 
republic which serves man and therefore has hope that man will 
serve it right back

the visit of romanias nicolae ceausescu 
only days before the communist dictator was overthrown was needed 
to protest a defense contract irans foreign minister said today 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati was summoned to parliament 
to explain why ceausescu was invited to iran last month but 
refused to give details on the vital defenserelated contract 
with romania 
only part of this contract had been implemented but if we had 
delayed the trip and stopped ceausescu from coming there was the 
possibility that this contract would not be implemented velayati 
was quoted as saying by official tehran radio monitored in nicosia 
this would be a fundamental disadvantage to the defense of the 
islamic republic 
during irans eightyear war with iraq romania was one of the 
eastern european countries that supplied iran with armaments 
including light weapons 
velayati has been criticized in the official media and by 
radical leaders who oppose the government of president hashemi 
rafsanjani 
he also told the parliament that romanias position as a 
nonpermanent member of the un security council was important for 
iran which is trying to persuade the world body to exert pressure 
on iraq to withdraw troops from iranian territory seized in war 
ceausescu was welcomed in tehran and signed an agreement to buy 
1 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year 
from iran 
velayati said that despite ceausescus fall contracts signed by 
him were still considered valid by romanias new government 
velayati rejected allegations that we had not given sufficient 
information to our authorities especially to the president about 
the situation in romania 
ceausescu was deposed by a popular uprising dec 22 and he and 
his wife elena were executed dec 25 after they were found guilty 
during a secret trial of genocide and other grave crimes 
the uprising against ceausescu began just before he left for 
tehran dec 18 
irans ambassador to bucharest mohammad jamshid gowhari was 
dismissed following ceausescus overthrow reportedly for his 
failure to inform the foreign ministry of the extent of the 
opposition to ceausescu 
but velayati said his dismissal was because after ceausescus 
trip he had said things in various places that did not befit the 
status of a diplomat 
velayati did not elaborate

november rebounding from a 01 percent decrease in october and 
reaching a 10month high the government said today 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4217 billion in november it was the highest level 
of spending since last januarys 423 billion rate 
total spending in october was revised downward from the 1 
percent increase reported initially 
the november surge was due to a 7 percent jump in government 
spending which represents about 20 percent of construction 
spending combined with a 06 percent gain in residential 
construction which accounts for about 50 percent of the total 
nonresidential spending was off 07 percent 
construction spending fell to a yearly low rate of 4103 
billion last july it has been among the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit by higher interest rates earlier this year brought 
about by the federal reserve efforts to restrain inflation by 
tightening credit 
but as inflation moderated the fed began last june to let 
shortterm rates drop and analysts have been saying the lower rates 
should result in increased construction 
fixedrate mortgages declined from a peak of 1122 percent last 
march to 974 percent at the end of november according to a weekly 
survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
residential construction totaled a seasonally adjusted 1944 
billion on an annual rate in november

pit comic richard belzer against wrestlers hulk hogan and mr t 
never made it into the ring the combatants settled out of court 
at the last moment 
norman roy grutman belzers lawyer revealed today that the 5 
million case involving an encounter on a cable tv show that left 
the comedian unconscious was settled in the last hour of the 
last working day of the year i have not signed any papers but we 
have exchanged faxes 
and what exactly was the settlement it includes a covenant of 
confidentiality which indicates that when asked by the media i am 
to say that the case has been settled to the mutual satisfaction 
of all parties 
the highprofile lawyer sounded a lot like a child who had lost 
a favorite christmas toy im not happy about it he admitted 
indeed a lot of wrestling fans lovers of comedy court buffs 
and devotees of the bizarre were looking forward to seeing hogan 
the 307pound world wrestling federation champ take on belzer 150 
pounds dripping wet 
jury selection had been scheduled to begin today 
the suit stems from the appearance of hogan and mr t on hot 
properties a cable program hosted by belzer in 1985 the two 
were promoting an upcoming wrestlemania tagteam bout the 
whole thing was videotaped and would have been shown at trial 
shortly into the segment belzer says things got ugly 
he gives a frontchin lock you know some people call it the 
sleeper hold belzer writes in his 1988 book how to be a 
standup comic 
his arms are as big as mine are gonna be if i pump iron for 
800 years so he gets me in a front chin lock and he starts 
squeezing i figured hes fooling around and then he squeezes 
more and it starts hurting and my brain goes check please no 
oxygen im outta here babe thank you 
belzer had submitted a threepage laundry list of injuries 
allegedly inflicted by hogan everything from nine stitches to the 
head to trauma to the skull and neck to severe humiliation 
he sued the hulkster his tagteam partner mr t world 
wrestling federation impresario vince mcmahon and mcmahons titan 
sports inc 
grutmans court papers never mentioned hogan by his ring name 
the big bad hulkster is simply terry gene bollea he and mr t are 
described as tough outrageous physically aggressive brash 
unswerving unsympathizing uncompromising macho types 
we see the suit as a publicity ploy pure and simple said 
wwf attorney ted dinsmoor before the settlement he asked the 
hulkster to demonstrate a wrestling move and he was accidentally 
injured 
said dinsmoor he wants to get his name in the news people 
dont go to court over a couple of stitches and tylenol for a

rival shiite moslem militias using tanks 
rocketpropelled grenades and 106mm guns today battled in southern 
lebanon and police said five people were killed and 12 wounded 
the fighting raged among the bluffs of kfar hatta village 
southeast of sidon a police spokesman said 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said the hills were essential for the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god to ensure supplies to its southern 
bases from the eastern bekaa valley 
kfar hatta is just below the mountainous routes controlled by 
israeli troops and allied south lebanon army militiamen from 
israels selfproclaimed buffer zone in southern lebanon 
the new casualties raised the overall toll to 64 killed and 228 
wounded since the current round of fighting erupted dec 13 
pitting the fundamentalist hezbollah against the prosyrian secular 
amal militia 
efforts by iran and yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization to curb the fighting have failed to stop the fighting 
an amal communique claimed its fighters repulsed a predawn 
hezbollah attack 
the infiltrators who came under cover of darkness were forced 
to flee in chaos leaving behind several dead on the battlefield 
said the communique which was issued in beirut 
a hezbollah communique blamed the escalation of hostilities on a 
relentless amal bombardment of its beleaguered bases in jbaa and 
ein bouswar south of kfar hatta 
both sides also traded charges of collaborating with israel and 
the south lebanon army their common enemy 
amals top commander in southern lebanon atef aoun has claimed 
iran paid 250000 to israel and the south lebanese army to allow 
hezbollah to move reinforcements from the bekaa to the region 
through south lebanese army lines 
he claimed he had evidence of such a payment but did not make 
it public 
statements from hezbollah have claimed that amal was out to 
expel proiranian fundamentalists from southern lebanon to set the 
stage for concluding a deal of coexistence with israel 
israel has maintained control over its selfproclaimed 
328squaremile security zone since 1985 using it as a buffer 
against crossborder guerrilla raids 
hezbollah is considered to be the umbrella organization for 
extremist groups holding 18 foreign hostages in lebanon including 
eight americans the longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march

ceausescu after the dictator was ousted dec 22 ceausescu was 
summarily tried and executed with his wife elena three days later 
citing eastern european and african diplomatic sources the

in two waterproof tubes attached to the underside of a colombian 
ship said police who seized the drug and arrested four men who 
showed up in diving gear 
police divers worked for more than 16 hours to detach the tubes 
from the cargo ship sunday 
as police watched four colombians in diving suits appeared at a 
boat ramp across the st johns river from the ship apparently to 
retrieve the 265pound cache authorities said the men were 
arrested on drug trafficking charges 
when you have four guys show up at the arlington boat ramp 
with diving gear its unlikely theyre here to spear fish said 
capt herschell connell head of the organized crime section of the 
sheriffs office 
the area is not known for sport diving especially in winter 
connell said the ship makes a trip every other week between 
jacksonville and caragena columbia and that police were tipped 
off about the drugs sailors aboard probably were unaware of the 
tubes and none were charged he said 
this is not the first time we had information there was 
something on the bottom of a ship but it was the first time we 
found something he said

an excommunicated parishioner set a 
historic church on fire and held police and firefighters at bay for 
up to an hour before coming outside to dance on the porch in face 
paint authorities say 
the man who had telephoned police an hour earlier monday saying 
he was baricaded inside the 87yearold wood building with hand 
grenades and other weapons had said he would surrender if he were 
allowed to dance 
it was something to the effect of a native american indian 
dance a police officer said he was jumping up and down 
the 25yearold man who was not immediately identified was 
arrested and was to be charged with burglary and arson today 
police said police found no weapons inside 
police officers gathered a block from the church while 
tourists oblivious to the standoff strolled past monuments and 
markers on the south side of the church where parishioners believe 
that christ will make his second coming 
the standoff ended when a police officer hiding behind a stone 
marker captured the man as he danced briefly outside his cheeks 
painted with brightly colored stripes authorities said 
firefighters then moved in and battled the blaze for about 25 
minutes but flames had engulfed its second floor 
the church was totaled said alvin harris pastor of the 
church of christ temple lot he said he believed it would cost 
200000 to 300000 to rebuild the church 
harris said the man who claimed to be part indian had recently 
danced around a centuryold tree and the tree had burned the man 
was sort of a religious zealot hes always acted kind of weird 
but nobody ever took him seriously we feel sorry for him harris 
said 
c leroy wheaton jr a church elder said members had to remove 
the man from the church during a prayer meeting last summer because 
he was wearing a sword and threatening people he thought he was 
the one to straighten us all out wheaton said 
church officials said the man was excommunicated a few months 
earlier and had been warning them for months that god had ordered 
him to cleanse the church site 
the mans name was removed from church records said william 
sheldon secretary of the council of apostles when it was 
discovered he had been baptized in another faith that like the 
church of christ temple lot follows the book of mormon 
the church that burned monday has about 200 members in the 
kansas city area and worldwide the denomination claims about 2300 
members the church of christ temple lot has no connection to the 
larger church of christ movement 
the church was built in 1902 on property purchased in 1867 by 
followers of the book of mormon

he died friday following a stroke and major intestinal surgery 
the bushes were accompanied as they entered the small 
traditional church by family members and white house aides 
including chief of staff john sununu and fitzwater 
bush entering through a side door apparently did not see the 
protesters who were standing with about three dozen onlookers 
behind police barricades across the street 
fitzwater announced the return of the 141 army troops based in 
fort ord calif on monday as the president flew home after a 
sixday vacation most of it in texas 
we want them all to come out as soon as possible except for 
the 12000 there permanently fitzwater said 
the first 56 soldiers arrived at kelly air force base in san 
antonio on monday for a layover before returning to fort ord 
pentagon spokesman maj david super said the troops were from the 
7th infantry division 
their military mission is finished its just a continued 
tailoring of the military force in panama as the need for combat 
troops is diminished super said the growing mission down 
there now is for nationbuilding and civil affairs 
fitzwater said other units would return home over the next few 
days 
well see groups like this coming out on a continuing basis 
he said adding that the troops would be withdrawn unit by unit 
because of varying duty assignments varying mopup needs that 
remain in panama 
the beginning of the troop withdrawal came 12 days after the 
predawn us invasion that toppled the government of dictator 
manuel antonio noriega on sunday bush visited two military 
hospitals in san antonio texas and met with us servicemen 
wounded in the action 
noriega has been holed up in the vatican embassy in panama city 
since christmas eve fitzwater said monday there was no change 
in the status of the stalemate between the united states and the 
roman catholic church over his fate 
over the weekend bush said he wanted to bring troops home as 
soon as possible but that he did not intend to act precipitously 
twentythree us servicemen and three civilians were killed in 
the invasion and more than 300 were wounded about 14000 us 
troops were sent by bush to augment the 12000 already there

the bushes youngest son marvin and daughterinlaw margaret of 
alexandria va had adopted a 2monthold boy charles walker 
bush the couple also has an adopted daughter marshall 3

girls 
theres something exciting we heard about the baby the day 
our brotherinlaw died theres something nice about that isnt 
there sort of magical mrs bush said i cried from happiness 
and sadness all day 
of ellis mrs bush said he was a wonderful man so wonderful 
that we wanted him not to live because he would have been a 
vegetable

from racial strife to vandalism at religious 
schools to the exclusionary traditions of private social clubs 
closetohome issues of bigotry are coming to georgias classrooms 
under a new education project 
the voluntary program to be formally unveiled thursday will 
provide teachers with materials and training to include 
antibigotry lessons in their curriculum the program includes 
general themes of racial religious and ethnic understanding and 
portions dealing with matters of specific interest to georgia 
the materials will be made available to school systems through 
the a world of difference campaign sponsored by the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith and several corporate 
backers the program got started in boston in 1985 and has expanded 
to about 25 cities said project coordinator ginger carter 
fourteen public and private school systems in georgia including 
the atlanta city schools have signed on as participants 
lessons are based on recent events of prejudice that can be 
incorporated into existing social studies or history classes the 
lessons examine incidents of discrimination by having students read 
articles about the examples become familiar with the vocabulary 
common to discussions about bigotry and discuss the implications of 
prejudice and attempts to stop such practices 
we ask the students to think about if a problem exists in 
their own school and how they can address them how would you 
react if something happened at your school and it was addressed at 
your race and religion mrs carter said 
in georgia the project also is being sponsored by georgia power 
co wagatv in atlanta and the californiabased milken family 
foundation 
the time for change is ripe said bill dahlberg president

as the first elements of the us 
invasion force withdrew panamas new president urged the vatican 
to surrender manuel antonio noriega to the united states because 
his government is incapable of trying him 
a church official said it was up to noriega to decide when to 
leave the vatican embassy where he sought refuge christmas eve 
after being ousted by us troops 
two artillery batteries from fort ord calif a total of 141 
soldiers were pulled out monday said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater one planeload of troops arrived at kelly air 
force base in san antonio late monday 
the rest of the 14000 troops sent in for the dec 20 invasion 
that toppled noriega will probably leave on a piecemeal basis 
fitzwater said he did not specify when that might occur 
the president is glad to see some of the troops coming home 
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible fitzwater said 
the 12000 troops permanently assigned to panama would remain 
twentythree us servicemen were killed in the operation and 
322 wounded among panamanians 297 soldiers and some 300 civilians 
were killed according to the us military 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger planned to fly to 
panama late today for talks with president guillermo endara on us 
aid to panama and other issues officials said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee flew to panama early today to review us military 
operations nunn was accompanied by sen john warner rva 
meanwhile 20 american diplomats expelled by nicaragua in 
retaliation for a us troop search of the residence of that 
countrys ambassador to panama left managua on monday night 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government on friday gave the 
diplomats 72 hours to leave the country and ordered the us 
embassy support staff cut from 320 employees to 100 
the united states apologized for the incident saying the troops 
were unaware the home was a diplomatic residence when they entered 
it over the protests of ambassador antenor ferrey to search for 
weapons president bush said it was a screwup but questioned 
what the numerous weapons found by troops were doing in the home 
in the latest round over noriegas fate endara said the 
stalemate could end if the vatican and the papal nuncio say once 
and for all that noriega doesnt deserve to be sheltered in the 
house of god that he is a common criminal of the worst kind and 
should abandon the sacred place 
noriega is charged with drug trafficking in the united states 
rogelio cruz endaras attorney general said sunday murder charges 
would be filed against noriega by today but cruz said he hadnt 
had time and i wont be filing charges today 
the move appeared to lay the groundwork for the mission to 
release noriega him to the panamanian government 
but endara said monday that panama does not have a prison secure 
enough to hold noriega he acknowledged that once outside the 
embassy the general would be captured by us troops surrounding 
the mission 
only after the american authorities are done can we have 
the opportunity to extradite him to panama and make him pay in 
panama for the crimes and offenses he has committed here in 
panama endara said after a new years day mass but for the 
moment we cant do it 
endara elected last may in balloting nullified by noriega is 
still in the early stages of establishing a government 
archbishop marcos mcgrath said noriega would have a fair trial 
and greater personal security if he went to the united states but 
said he will have to leave by his own decision 
he will have to weigh his choices and come up with that which 
is the least disagreeable mcgrath said in an interview vatican 
officials have said they were urging noriega to leave of his own 
accord 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro confirmed that vatican envoy 
monsignor giacinto berloco arrived at the embassy to give a 
hand to the negotiations navarro declined to give any details 
and said the vatican would have no comment on the affair today 
navarro was asked to say whether a muchreported endara letter 
allegedly asking vatican to turn over noriega had arrived navarro 
refused to answer the question 
in other developments the us southern command said it 
arrested rodolfo papito chiari noriegas interior and justice 
minister on saturday the military communique gave no details 
us troops the only real security force in the country since 
the invasion have been arresting anyone the panamanian government 
wants detained 
fifty members of noriegas machos del monte battalion which 
came to his defense during an oct 3 coup attempt surrendered 
sunday near rio hato 80 miles southwest of panama city the 
southern command said 
the process of transferring the panama canal to the panamanian 
government advanced a step further monday when fernando manfredo a 
62yearold economist became acting administrator of the waterway 
he is the first panamanian to hold the post since the canal began 
operation 75 years ago 
the 1977 canal treaties cede control of the canal to panama on 
dec 31 1999 the agreements set a jan 1 1990 date for a 
panamanian to be named canal administrator

defusing a political crisis that threatened the 
coalition government prime minister yitzhak shamir today canceled 
his decision to fire science minister ezer weizman for alleged 
contacts with the plo 
in a political compromise weizman had agreed to quit the 
decisionmaking inner cabinet the announcement came after shamir 
summoned weizman today 
in baghdad iraq a palestine liberation organization official 
said shamir himself had sent a message to plo leader yasser arafat 
a few months ago on a possible settlement of the mideast crisis 
i wonder why shamir is making a lot of noise about weizmans 
contacts with the plo when he and other senior israeli politicians 
made similar contacts said bassam abu sharif arafats political 
adviser 
abu sharif who is known to have contacted israeli officials on 
behalf of the plo declined to reveal the precise contents of the 
message or say who was the intermediary 
in israel a spokesman for shamir dismissed abu sharifs claim 
as utter nonsense shamirs earlier firing of weizman sparked a 
major cabinet crisis in israel 
the agreement between weizman and shamir ended two days of 
intense efforts to save the coalition of the conservative likud 
bloc that shamir heads and the centerleft labor party of which 
weizman is a senior member 
the crisis was the worst to shake a likudlabor alliance in six 
years and concerned a major issue that has split the nation how 
to resolve israels festering conflict with palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
on sunday shamir gave weizman written notice that he was fired 
as of today because of contacts with the plo in which weizman 
allegedly divulged secret israeli strategy that he learned in 
meetings of the 12member inner cabinet 
weizman told reporters after the fiveminute meeting that shamir 
had not confronted him with evidence of the plo contacts 
firstly the crisis is over secondly all attempts to say i 
am guilty or not i dont accept because for me guilt is a matter of 
being brought to court or not weizman told reporters 
weizman 65 a former defense minister who defected from likud 
said shamir took back the dismissal letter 
the arrangement was worked out before the meeting and finalized 
in shamirs office with smiles and a handshake weizman said 
adding he would go ahead with a planned trip to moscow on wednesday 
under the compromise weizman will remain science minister in 
the overall 26member cabinet but will no longer sit in sessions 
of the inner cabinet where government strategy is decided 
eliakim rubinstein the cabinet secretary and a top shamir aide 
said shamir would consider restoring weizman to the inner cabinet 
in 18 months 
the prime minister stressed to mr weizman the seriousness 
with which he viewed all contacts with terrorist organizations 
leading them the plo rubinstein said 
labor had demanded that weizman not be ousted without a chance 
to see and respond to evidence against him labor leaders were 
split however over how far to go in defending weizman who has 
openly advocated talks with the plo despite government policy 
against any dealings with the organization 
defense minister yitzhak rabin who was reportedly shown the 
evidence told labpr party colleagues monday he was uncertain 
whether shamir does not have a case against weizman 
weizman said the compromise that ended the crisis was worked out 
by rabin and vice premier shimon peres labors chairman im a 
party man and i had to listen to my colleagues it was hard for me 
but i had to accept this 
shamirs evidence against weizman including his alleged 
exchange of messages with arafat was gathered by the shin bet 
indicating the secret service had been shadowing the cabinet 
minister for some time israeli media reported 
shamir claimed weizmans contacts with the plo were undermining 
israels efforts to launch middle east peace talks shamirs 
strategy is based on excluding the plo from negotiations 
according to israel radio the most serious accusation was that 
weizman advised plo leaders in a telephone call to tunis that if 
they take the right steps they will even get jerusalem whch 
israel has declared its capital 
weizman sharply criticized shamir for leaking the accusations 
without showing him the evidence i am already accused of selling

more than 25 years after launching her crusade to 
clean up television mary whitehouse is still fighting to keep sex 
violence and fourletter words off the air 
now instead of being a lone voice the 79yearold woman has 
the backing of prime minister margaret thatcher prince charles and 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
her latest target is the british broadcasting corps radio 
serialization of lady chatterleys lover which began monday 
night on the popular program a book at bedtime the dh 
lawrence novel is being read complete with sexually explicit 
passages and fourletter words 
to give the status of a book at bedtime to lady 
chatterleys lover and the language which was included in it 
seemed to us to be totally inappropriate and irresponsible mrs 
whitehouse said in an interview 
and what i felt after listening to it last night reinforced 
what i said it gave the fourletter word and other things a sort 
of status and respectibility if they can do it then why 
shouldnt everyone else use the word all the time it opens the 
door wider and wider 
the bbc preceded its broadcast with a warning about the explicit 
content but mrs whitehouse said i have no faith in these 
warnings they attract the very people you feel they may be 
unhelpful to 
mrs whitehouses reaction came as no surprise she has been 
campaigning since 1964 when she founded her national viewers and 
listeners association to fight violence on tv 
it was the height of the permissive 1960s and mrs whitehouse 
then an art teacher said she had begun to detect a great deal of 
sexual and moral confusion in the minds of her students over what 
they had seen on tv 
her main target was the publicly funded bbc nearly half a 
million people signed a petition in 1964 to close down the bbc 
accusing it of broadcasting propaganda of disbelief doubt and 
dirt 
the bbc stayed on the air but barred mrs whitehouse from its 
programs for 15 years its directorgeneral at the time sir hugh 
greene said years later that her only contribution had been to 
raise the national level of intolerance mrs whitehouse wrote in 
her autobiography that greene was above all responsible for the 
moral collapse of the 60s and 70s 
critics still accuse her of trying to be the nations censor 
young people are not driven to excesses by explicit scenes of 
sex on the screen shes a very sincere lady but one of the most 
misguided said harry turner managing director of television 
south west an independent company 
bbc controller jonathan powell said some of her views are 
quite sensible for example against the exploitation of violence 
in the name of entertainment but her rejection of the portrayal of 
sexual relationships on tv is a more difficult matter 
she has complained about the portrayal of homosexual 
relationships in the popular british soap opera eastenders and 
sexually explicit scenes watched by a 10yearold in the singing 
detective a semiautobiographical series by british playwright 
dennis potter 
mrs whitehouse also objected to the following american films 
that were shown over christmas and new years on british tv 
hollywood shuffle about the difficulties of a black actor 
trying to make a living the language was in our terms and 
american terms absolutely unbelievable i couldnt repeat it and 
wouldnt repeat it she said 
the verdict starring paul newman which she criticized 
for very bad language and violence 
legal eagles starring debra winger and robert redford 
its violent a man violently hits two women to the floor one 
is knocked out she said 
volunteers which she said contained foul language 
obscene language blasphemy 
mrs whitehouse insists her only demand is that broadcasters 
fulfill their responsibility not to offend against good taste and 
decency or incite crime 
it isnt that ones against sex or showing on tv that men and 
women love each other but its the kind of closeup voyeurism that 
people are sick and tired of she says 
i dont want to open up someone elses bedroom doors and watch 
whats going on and i dont imagine the vast majority of other 
people do either in any case we all know what sex is about we 
dont have to have it played out in front of our eyes 
mrs whitehouse may not be taken seriously by some but her 
speeches draw capacity audiences and as influential figures such 
as mrs thatcher have spoken up against overly explicit tv mrs 
whitehouse has come closer to representing mainstream british 
values 
in the united states the battle over the content of tv shows 
has been waged by groups such as christian leaders for responsible 
television a coalition of officials from 70 mainline and 
conservative protestant denominations and more than 70 roman 
catholic bishops as well as individuals such as terry rakolta a 
michigan woman who objected to sexual innuendo on programs such as 
fox tvs comedy married with children 
in 1988 in what was widely seen as a backlash against the 
permissive 1960s the british government created the broadcasting 
standards council an agency to monitor sex and violence taste 
and decency 
mrs whitehouse claims to have secured legislation to ban child 
pornography control pornography in shop windows and on magazine 
covers and classify videotape rentals 
last month her association finally succeeded in getting the 
government to introduce legislation to bring broadcasting under the 
obscenity laws 
mrs whitehouses latest goal is to ensure that satellite tv 
recently launched in britain does not beam in sexually explict 
programs from abroad

city downplaying racial and ethnic tensions stirred by his 
election and even the inaugural ceremony 
dinkins described his city as a gorgeous mosaic of race 
and religious faith of national origin and sexual orientation of 
individuals whose families arrived yesterday and a generation ago 
coming through ellis island or kennedy airport or on buses bound 
for the port authority bus terminal 
but the inaugural ceremony monday demonstrated the divisions in 
the city the democrat inherits jews objected to the presence of 
archbishop desmond tutu of south africa and aids activists to the 
benediction by cardinal john j oconnor whom they accuse of 
hampering the fight against the disease 
also sworn in monday were michael white of cleveland henry 
spallone of yonkers ny and john c daniels of new haven conn 
sophie masloff the first woman elected mayor in pittsburgh 
took the oath of office today masloff 72 the former council 
president assumed office in 1988 after the death of mayor richard 
s caliguiri and won a full fouryear term in november maynard h 
jackson was to be sworn in as mayor tonight in atlanta 
dinkins succeeded edward i koch the outspoken threeterm mayor 
he defeated in the democratic primary in september dinkins went on 
to beat republican rudolph giuliani a former us attorney by a 
narrow margin 
dinkins 62 just completed a term as manhattan borough 
president 
dinkins said he wanted nobel peace prizewinner tutu and 
oconnor at his inauguration because they are leaders and friends 
even though were not in synch on all things 
many jews object to tutus support for a palestinian state and 
aids activists oppose the catholic churchs condemnation of 
homosexuality and its opposition to some kinds of aids education 
in cleveland former state sen michael white pledged to fight 
crime racism homelessness poor education and other city problems 
after taking the oath monday to become clevelands 54th mayor 
we see where ours has become a city where children go hungry 
where sickness goes untreated and where whole families are left 
homeless we watch our children grow through a school system 
that produces adults who in too many instances cannot read and 
we see a city still haunted by the malignancy of racism white 
said 
white 38 a democrat later paid tribute to his predecessor 
republican mayor george voinovich and presented him with a key to 
the city 
voinovich became mayor in november 1979 and has announced plans 
to run for governor this year 
in new haven former state sen john c daniels the citys 
first black mayor vowed during his inauguration speech to seek 
counsel from the maximum number of citizens 
if there was ever a time when a small group of politicians and 
business leaders could sit in a room and determine what was best 
for the city and where city resources should be spent that time 
is certainly past said daniels a 53yearold democrat who 
replaced biaggio dilieto as mayor 
dilieto 67 who also is a democrat decided not to run for 
reelection after 10 years in office daniels is new havens 48th 
mayor 
in yonkers democratturnedrepublican henry spallone stressed 
honesty and integrity in his inaugural speech he offered 
conciliatory words on a federal housing desegregation plan that was 
key to his victory over oneterm mayor nicholas wasicsko a 
democrat 
spallone 63 a former detective was one of four city council 
members who balked at implementing us district judge leonard b 
sands desegregation order the four appealed a contempt citation

a tugboat rescued a barge sinking in the 
monongahela river with 400000 gallons of fuel today and crews 
drained the remaining gasoline from another barge that spilled up 
to 10000 gallons 
the sinking barge did not leak any of its gasoline and diesel 
cargo as it was pulled ashore today it had rammed up against a 
lock and dam after breaking loose from its mooring monday at 
charleroi 25 miles south of pittsburgh 
tugboat operators today arrived to pump out river water that had 
seeped into the barge and freed it from the lock and dam about 40 
minutes later 
the two barges were among at least 50 to break loose monday when 
rushing ice broke mooring ropes along a 40mile stretch from 
brownsville north to pittsburgh the coast guard and state agencies 
continued rounding up the barges 
the leaking barge owned by gutman oil co in charleroi hit the 
monongahela bridge and ruptured about 15 miles south of pittsburgh 
spilling gasoline monday the barge was pumped clean today of its 
remaining 360000 gallons 
ms mallison said the spill did not affect area water supplies 
and regional director of the department of environmental resources 
said the damage to the environment would be slight 
the barge was tied up along the shore near new eagle late in the 
afternoon monday but the swift current prevented a tug pushing two 
cleanup barges from reaching the site 
the gasoline spill came nearly two years after a diesel fuel 
spill of between 750000 and 1 million gallons in the monongahela 
fouled the drinking water of ohio river communities in three states 
about 11000 fish and 2000 waterfowl were killed in the jan 2 
1988 spill but researchers said the rivers recovery was rapid 
and that the oil concentration at the bottom of the rivers is 
declining 
the bottom line is the residual effects are not very 
significant at this time said edgar berkey president of the 
university of pittsburghs center for hazardous materials research 
several miles south of the leaking barge about 25 coal barges 
broke loose monday and piled up at the maxwell dam where severe 
flooding resulting from a similar barge jamup in 1985 damaged 
numerous homes about 200 people temporarily evacuated their homes 
monday near maxwell 30 miles south of pittsburgh 
a dozen barges also broke loose in pittsburgh early monday and 
floated into the ohio river three became stuck underneath the 
historic smithfield street bridge in pittsburgh and the span was 
temporarily closed to traffic

a typical american familys ability to buy a 
medianpriced home improved in november but many firsttime 
homebuyers still were unable to afford startertype houses a trade 
group said tuesday 
the national association of realtors reported that its housing 
affordability index rose to 1058 in november meaning that a 
family with a median income of 33482 had 1058 percent of the 
income needed to buy a medianpriced existing home costing 93000 
the index was the highest since february when it registered 
1067 it was 1055 in october 
the median means that half the families earn more and half less 
or that half of the homes sell for more and half for less 
the increase in the november index was attributed to a declining 
mortgage interest rates and an increase in the median family income 
from 33365 in october to 33482 in november the realtors said 
the association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixedrate 
and adjustablerate mortgages by its calculation rates fell from 
1016 percent in october to 1012 percent the next month 
these two factors offset a slight increase in the national 
median price which rose from 92600 to 93000 it said 
the changes increased the monthly principal and interest payment 
on a median home by 1 to 660 in november which represents 236 
percent of the median familys income 
nar president norman d flynn said the drop in rates generally 
is having the most impact on middleincome buyers 
we continue to see buyers taking advantage of favorable 
financing flynn said the drop in rates generally is having 
the most impact in areas where housing is affordable for 
moderateincome buyers 
but realtors chief economist john a tuccillo noted that many 
firsttime buyers have insufficient income to make the transistion 
from renter to homeowner 
the nars thirdquarter index for firsttime homebuyers showed 
that on a national basis they had only 71 percent of the income 
needed to buy a typical starter home

about 20000 inmates and detainees 
have begun leaving czechoslovak prisons under the broadest amnesty 
in 40 years officials said today 
new president vaclav havel himself imprisoned more than five 
years for his political beliefs announced the amnesty on new 
years day officials say it will set free about twothirds of all 
prisoners and people awaiting trial except top communists accused 
of abusing their power 
according to justice ministry officials there are 31000 people 
in prisons and jails 
the official ctk news agency quoted justice minister dagmar 
buresova as saying some 20000 prisoners and detainees were being 
freed under the amnesty and other cases would be reexamined 
the amnesty took effect immediately with the release of some 
prisoners and was to be completed by jan 21 it applies to all 
inmates except those imprisoned for murder sex crimes or abuse of 
public authority 
the highestranking former official to face that charge is 
ousted prague communist party boss miroslav stepan considered 
responsible for violent police handling of a peaceful student 
demonstration on nov 17 
havels decree stipulates that people convicted of terrorism 
murder rape and sexual abuse also cannot be freed but their 
sentences will be reduced by a year theoretically that could 
result in the release of such criminals with a year or less 
remaining to their prison sentences 
sentences for other intentional acts will be reduced by at least 
two years and for crimes out of negligence by at least three 
years havel also appointed a new prosecutor general 
czechoslovak television called it the broadest amnesty since the 
communist takeover four decades ago 
before he stepped down dec 10 former communist president 
gustav husak freed virtually all political prisoners but 
opposition sources say at least six people are in jail on dubious 
espionage convictions 
in his first speech as president havel fiercely attacked the 
toppled communist regime saying it ravaged the economy and 
environment 
havel reaffirmed his commitment to free elections and a free 
market and urged the dalai lama and pope john paul ii to visit he 
called for full diplomatic ties with the vatican and israel 
the oncebanned playwright elected by parliament on friday 
flew to east berlin today on his first trip abroad in two decades 
he met with communist premier hans modrow and president manfred 
gerlach who like havel is a noncommunist who rose to power on a 
wave of reform sweeping eastern europe 
afterward havel gave hesitant endorsement to german 
reunification saying a peaceful democracy can be as large as it 
wants he then traveled to munich west germany later in the day 
to see chancellor helmut kohl and president richard von weizsaecker 
thousands of bavarians cheered vaclav vaclav as he was 
driven through munich 
kohl said havels rise to the presidency epitomized the changes 
that have led to a european spring a reference to the 1968 
prague spring reform movement that was crushed by a warsaw pact 
invasion 
on monday the vivid straightforward language of havels speech 
contrasted with the bland style of his discredited predecessors 
out of gifted and sovereign people the communist regime 
made us little screws in a monstrously big rattling and stinking 
machine we have become morally sick havel said in the broadcast 
address our country does not flourish we have the worst 
environment in europe 
czechoslovakia was an economic power before world war ii but 
slid into stagnation under 41 years of communist rule pollution 
from the heavy industrial plants fostered by the communists 
sickened the environment 
we have to accept this legacy as something we have inflicted 
upon ourselves he said 
havel urged the establishment of diplomatic ties with the 
vatican and israel 
all warsaw pact nations except romania cut ties with israel 
after the 1967 middle east war hungary also in the grip of 
democratic change was the first to renew full ties in september 
and the soviet union and poland renewed lowlevel ties in the last 
three years 
last month poland and czechoslovakia said full ties with the 
jewish state would be renewed in 1990

rival shiite moslem militias fought for 
the hilly apple orchards of kfar hatta village tuesday in their 
bloody war for supremacy in south lebanon five people were 
reported killed and 18 wounded 
police said members of the two militias amal and hezbollah 
battled with tanks rocketpropelled grenades and jeepmounted 
106mm recoilless rifles in the applegrowing region southeast of 
sidon 
they said hezbollah which is loyal to iran needed control of 
the hills to protect the flow of supplies from the bekaa valley to 
its bases in south lebanon 
kfar hatta lies just below mountain routes controlled by 
israeli troops and a predominantly christian allied militia that 
link israels security zone in south lebanon to jezzine a 
christian town east of sidon 
tuesdays casualties raised the toll to 64 killed and 234 
wounded since dec 13 when the latest fighting began between 
hezbollah and amal a mainstream shiite militia supported by syria 
iranian spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei told visiting 
lebanese shiite clergymen in tehran on tuesday they should stop 
this fratricide tehran radio reported 
we feel a great burden of responsibility for what is occurring 
among our moslem children and these problems should be solved at 
the root the radio quoted him as saying 
a statement from amal claimed its fighters repulsed a hezbollah 
attack on the kfar hatta hills before dawn 
the infiltrators who came under cover of darkness were 
forced to flee in chaos leaving behind several dead on the 
battlefield it said 
amal chief nabih berri appealed to khamenei to stop iranian arms 
deliveries to hezbollah his press office in beirut reported 
a hezbollah statement blamed the fighting on amal bombardment of 
its bases in jbaa and ein bouswar south of kfar hatta 
each side accuses the other of collaborating with israel and its 
surrogate militia the south lebanon army 
atef aoun the amal commander in south lebanon has claimed iran 
paid 250000 to israel and the south lebanon army to let hezbollah 
move reinforcements from the bekaa to the apple region through 
militia lines near jezzine 
i have the evidence of the payment i will make it public at 
the appropriate time he said in a statement broadcast by several 
beirut radio stations 
hezbollah statements have claimed amals aim was to expel 
proiranian fundamentalists from all of south lebanon and conclude 
a coexistence deal with israel 
israel established the border zone in 1985 when it withdrew 
from a threeyear occupation of lebanon as a buffer against 
guerrilla raids the apple region faces the central sector of the 
zone a strip 6 to 10 miles deep from mediterranean coast 40 miles 
inland to the foothills of mount hermon 
police have cited the battle for control of the predominantly 
shiite region as a major factor in a sharp decline of guerrilla 
attacks into the israeli zone their records indicate a drop to 380 
raids 1989 from 740 in 1987 and 780 in 1988

creteanu the orphanages chief medical officer 
an ill woman could not have an abortion so many genetic 
illnesses were passed to the children she said 
she said about 40 of the children suffered from down syndrome 
genetic disorders or severe birth defects 
some parents dont want the children because they are ill 
some parents cannot take care of them she said some of the 
other children were abandoned because their parents already have 
too many children or because their mother was unwed and too young 
to care for her child 
in 1987 ceausescu ordered a freeze on adoptions by foreign 
citizens who had been paying thousands of dollars in fees and more 
under the table to get a child 
ms creteanu said there were 129 children at her orphanage whose 
paperwork had been completed who were waiting only for a lifting 
of the freeze 
livia mann a romanian emigre who lives in portland ore said 
she and her husband are childless and have been trying to win the 
freedom of their adopted 3yearold daughter mihalache georgiana 
for 2 years 
the girl lives with mrs manns sister in bucharest the old 
government allowed them to take the child out of the orphanage but 
not out of the country 
we paid 1400 in fees at first but the government lawyer 
always told us there were more papers to sign my husband had to 
come back to romania twice every year to sign papers every time 
the lawyer wanted money a color television or some other 
present she said 
mrs mann said the couple spent between 8000 and 10000 in 
their effort to get mihalache georgiana to the united states 
now the new government tells us too many things are going on 
and that this is not exactly an emergency she said i hope it 
will be very soon but it will not be today or tommorrow i hope it 
will be within four or five months 
without foreign adoption most of the kids at orphanage no 1 
face a childhood spent in state institutions there is no shortage 
of children in the romania the ceausescus left behind 
by the time they reach 4 the children at orphanage no 1 will 
have been sent to state residence schools said ms creteanu 
at the orphanage 180 people including doctors nurses and 
medical students work around the clock to care for the children 
the staff seems caring and efficient but overwhelmed by the numbers 
and the emotional needs of such young children 
in the rooms of white cribs some of the toddlers shout with 
glee at the sight of visitors they hold out their arms pleading 
to be picked up others stare blankly and rock slowly from side to 
side as they stand in their cribs 
dr horia talfes a volunteer at the orphanage in his spare 
time laughs and plays briefly with a 3yearold girl he said the 
girl had been born premature and had required extensive medical 
care 
what we need he said is specialized medicine for 
children and modern equipment ours is so antiquated we have 
plenty of general medicines but not enough of the kinds made 
specially for small children 
ms creteanu clung to the hope that romanias revolution will 
make things better for its unwanted children 
i think things will be better for the children and i think the 
number of children in the orphanages around the country will 
decrease she said noting the new government had already 
repealed the family laws the new government has already said it 
will lift the restrictions on foreign adoption

deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
was heading a highlevel delegation that planned to fly to panama 
late today for talks with president guillermo endara about us aid 
and other issues the state department said 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said the purpose is to learn 
firsthand from the panamanian leadership about their plans for 
economic recovery and to make recommendations to president bush on 
ways in which the united states can help 
boucher left the impression that eagleburgers mission as 
presently planned will not involve efforts to influence ongoing 
talks with the vatican and panamanian officials over the fate of 
ousted dictator manuel antonio noriega 
the spokesman said contacts continue but he gave no details 
except to reaffirm that the administration wants noriega sent to 
the united states to face drugtrafficking charges 
noriega has been staying at the vatican embassy since he sought 
sanctuary there on dec 24 four days after american troops invaded 
panama 
eagleburger is being accompanied by deputy treasury secretary 
john robson and a team of policy experts 
they will confer on wednesday with endara panamas two vice 
presidents and other prominent panamanians including leaders of 
the countrys business community 
among other subjects they will discuss a dismantling of the 
sanctions imposed on panama over the past two years as part of the 
us campaign against noriega 
of the estimated 370 million in panamanian assets frozen in the 
united states about 70 million has been returned to panama since 
the invasion boucher said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee flew to panama early today to review us military 
operations nunn was accompanied by sen john warner rva 
on thursday house majority leader richard gephardt dmo will 
lead a 30member house delegation on a twoday trip to panama city 
an aide to gephardt said the visit is not designed to evaluate 
or second guess the invasion but will be forward looking aimed 
at what congress will need to do to help rebuild panamas economy

a dismal performance by blacks 
on high school exams has jolted communities into a search for 
remedies with one newspaper calling for foreign aid to ensure that 
blacks are ready to govern after apartheid 
stop the rot said a banner headline tuesday in the sowetan 
the countrys largestselling daily aimed at black readers 
its editor aggrey klaaste wrote that foreign countries should 
consider a minimarshall plan to ease a crisis that produced a 
58 percent failure rate for black high school seniors 
other community leaders while blaming the whiterun government 
for the problem said blacks must rely on themselves to make 
improvements in soweto the largest black township a parents 
group announced that an emergency meeting on the school crisis 
would be held sunday 
antiapartheid activists and black civic leaders have complained 
for years about problems in segregated black schools ranging from 
underfunding to overcrowding to classroom violence but the sense 
of alarm intensified after the government announced last week that 
only 42 percent of black high school seniors had passed their 
standardized matriculation exams the lowest pass rate since 1962 
of the 190081 blacks who took the tests in november 74249 
passed and 17553 did well enough to qualify for automatic 
admission to universities by contrast more than 95 percent of 
white students passed the same set of tests and more than 40 
percent qualified for universities 
the best performances among blacks were in rural areas generally 
insulated from the political unrest that has wracked urban 
townships since 1984 at high schools in soweto where 25 million 
blacks live pass rates ranged from 14 percent to 29 percent 
the soweto civic association headed by prominent antiapartheid 
activists issued a statement monday blaming this tragedy on 
the government and the department of education and training which 
oversees black education 
thousands and thousands of childrens lives have been maimed 
over the years by the policies of the government the committee 
said their future as responsible parents and citizens of 
tomorrow have forever been destroyed 
the central problem said the committee is that white officials 
refuse parents the right to take effective control of their 
childrens education 
the committee joined other antiapartheid groups in suggesting 
that black pupils try to enroll at the nearest public school when 
the new academic year starts this month this would mean black 
families who have moved into whitesonly innercity areas in 
defiance of residential segregation laws would present their 
children for admission at whitesonly schools 
walter sisulu a senior leader of the african national congress 
guerrilla movement freed in october after 26 years in prison 
described the exam results as a blow to the community but 
reiterated his appeal for young blacks to pursue an education 
we must persevere so that at the end of the day we have 
skilled people who are able to handle things when change comes 
he said 
klaaste said the education crisis could affect the longterm 
prospects for blacks to gain voting rights and take partial or full 
control of the government 
these expectations will be dashed and even 
desperatelyfoughtfor political solutions will come to naught if 
we do not stop the rot klaaste wrote 
for its survival this country should be engaged in the biggest 
program in history to get blacks educated and if the world is 
willing to help money almost proportionate to a minimarshall plan 
should be poured into black education

the sprawling palace of the republic 
and the nearby boulevard of the victory of socialism that dominate 
downtown bucharest will serve as a lasting reminder of the ambition 
of their late dictator 
the immense palace complex still unfinished after six years of 
hard work was conceived by nicolae ceausescu as an administrative 
center housing the countrys parliament government and the 
headquarters of the nowdefunct communist party 
the building was also to include a large presidential suite from 
which the ceausescu family could exercise absolute control over the 
state 
a balcony was designed so ceausescu during governmentorganized 
rallies could address crowds gathered on a vast plateau in front 
of the palace 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said below the 
palace there is a bunker outfitted like a war room with 
sophisticated commands and a network of tunnels leading for miles 
up to a lake on bucharests north side 
more than 15000 workers toiled aroundtheclock on the site 
said col constantin luta a senior construction engineer who led 
journalists on a tour of the heavily guarded complex 
the pressure was hard all the time to complete the works but 
it was beyond human ability to finish on deadline he said 
luta added that although no specific completion date had been 
set ceausescu wanted to move in by 1991 
he said it was impossible to estimate the cost of the complex 
which is 75 percent completed because no financial records are 
available 
informed sources however said the palace of the republic and 
its surroundings have cost about 800 million since 1984 when work 
on the project started 
luta said it was also impossible to estimate how much marble and 
gold leaf was used to line the palaces walls and ceilings 
although the 258foottall and 720footwide building is 
generally complete on the outside much remains to be done on the 
inside the interior is littered with scaffolding marble slabs and 
cement bags 
the interior clearly intended to awe visitors by its size and 
opulence was to be finished in marble and wood paneling with gold 
leaf inlay in the baroque plaster decorations on the ceilings 
the amount of work was staggering and no matter how many 
workers were assigned to the project we were always told we were 
late luta said 
before the work began housing had to be provided for about 
50000 people from old residential section of the capital that was 
razed to make way for the palace and the avenue that leads to it 
many of the bulldozed prewar buildings and several of the 
centuryold 13 churches demolished in the process were of 
historical value luta said 
ceausescu and his wife elena took a great personal interest 
in the project and visited the site at least once a week 
they interfered in its classical palace design so often that 
it no longer bears any resemblance to the original luta said 
he added that their demands were extremely difficult to 
fulfill because they did not understand anything about 
architecture and they caused enormous delays and headaches for the 
builders 
the boulevard of the victory of socialism a 3milelong avenue 
that opens on the palace square is almost equally striking 
the 450footwide avenue is lined with dozens of highrise 
apartment blocks decorated with arches turrets greek columns and 
marblefronted balconies apartments there were reserved for 
highranking communist and secret police 
many of the sandcolored buildings are finished but none is 
occupied in accordance with ceausescus master plan that tenants 
should move in all at once upon completion of the palace 
elaborate wrought iron street lamps marble fountains and small 
plazas line the avenue 
behind it are the narrow muddy streets of the old town where 
stores are dark and shoppers crowd to buy meat cheese butter and 
other basic staples in short supply for years until ceausecu was 
toppled dec 22 
officials said a special commission will be formed to decide 
what to do with the monstrosity as residents call the palace 
luta said that because of the money spent on it there is no 
question of tearing it down 
to demolish it now would be a greater crime than those crimes 
of ceausescu he said

a federal judge today ordered that texas 
nine biggest counties hold special judicial elections in may under 
a setup less likely to dilute hispanics voting power 
the nine counties must elect their judges from districts rather 
than from each county as a whole said us district judge lucius 
bunton 
buntons order is based in part on a settlement negotiated by 
texas attorney general jim mattox and the league of united latin 
american citizens which successfully sued the state on grounds 
that countywide systems of electing state judges diluted minority 
voting strength 
buntons plan will affect only 1990 elections and is designed to 
be replaced with a new permanent setup to be drafted by the 
legislature 
the judge citing numerous delays by the governor and 
legislature in dealing with the issue said he was forced to go 
ahead and fashion an interim election plan that law equity and 
justice require 
bunton today said the judges will be elected to fouryear terms 
from districts based on existing political divisions such as 
legislative districts justice of the peace precincts and county 
commissioner precincts 
the elections will take place in bexar dallas harris tarrant 
travis jefferson lubbock ector and midland counties 
bunton ruled in november that the countywide method of electing 
judges violates the us voting rights act at the time 
nonhispanic whites held 155 of the 172 district judgeships in the 
nine counties 
the judges interim plan will affect 115 state district court 
seats in the nine counties 
gov bill clements has said he wants to call a special 
legislative session in the spring to reform judicial elections 
clements however favors appointing judges then voting only on 
whether to retain them 
lulac has objected to an appointment system saying it would 
continue to shut out minorities 
lulac three black former district judges from dallas and a 
handful of other groups filed the lawsuit in 1988

israels latest political crisis centered on 
the question of whether it was ready to talk with the plo the 
answer was no even though behindthescenes contacts have become 
almost commonplace 
the issue was science minister ezer weizmans alleged dealings 
with yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization prime minister yitzhak shamir shocked the nation 
sunday by saying he was firing weizman a member of the centerleft 
labor party 
shamir who leads the rightwing likud bloc accused the former 
defense minister of going behind his back to meet with israels 
most dangerous enemies 
worse he said weizman gave arafat advice on how to block 
israeli attempts to keep the plo out of proposed peace negotiations 
weizman contended his contacts with palestinians contributed to 
peace he said the shin bet security service which reports to 
shamir was aware of them 
shimon peres vice premier and leader of the labor party 
threatened to leave the national unity coalition and bring down 
the yearold government 
in the end however labor shied away from forcing elections and 
a compromise was reached weizman will retain his portfolio but be 
removed from the policymaking inner cabinet for at least 18 months 
although he withdrew the decision to dismiss weizman shamir 
appeared to strengthen his position by showing he had strong 
support even in the labor party for continuing the policy of not 
dealing with the plo 
labors failure to take up the challenge disappointed israeli 
doves and prominent palestinians working for palestinianisraeli 
talks and for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
this government is unable to take decisive steps for peace 
said faisal husseini a proplo activist israel needs elections 
more than the palestinians 
amnon rubinstein a liberal legislator and head of the shinui 
party said the government should come out and tell the truth 
that there is no chance for peace without talking to the plo 
the weizman affair illustrates the increasing difficulty of 
maintaining credibility for the official policy of refusing all 
dealings with the plo which israel views as a terror organization 
weizman who advocates direct talks with the plo accused shamir 
and even his own labor party leaders of hypocrisy 
he said shamir and defense minister yitzhak rabin a ranking 
labor member had sounded out peace proposals with palestinians 
from the occupied lands who acted as direct conduits to the plo 
weizman said the shin bet not only knew of his plo contacts but 
even offered advice on what to say 
peres listened in on one telephone call to an arab contact in 
tunis where the plo has its headquarters and passed on a message 
urging plo acceptance of us plans for israelipalestinian 
negotiations weizman said 
he also argued that the government was indirectly negotiating 
with the plo via the united states and egypt 
there is a long history of secret dealings with the plo 
including prisoner exchanges and the permission rabin gave recently 
for a missing soldiers father to visit plo headquarters seeking 
information 
recently contacts have become more public liberal politicians 
academics and journalists have joined with plo members in large 
european forums also attended by others thus skirting a 1986 law 
against unauthorized contact 
despite all this abie nathan israels leading peace activist 
is serving a sixmonth jail term on conviction of having met with 
arafat in tunis 
an editorial in the conservative daily maariv suggested the 
contradictory policy may have to end 
is there a need to talk to the plo it asked not a few 
people think there is and many say so openly not a few people 
think there will not be any way to avoid such talks but prefer to 
be carried along by their forelocks rather than take the 
initiative

republican gov kay orr said today she will 
seek a second fouryear term in 1990 
mrs orr marked her 51st birthday by announcing the decision 
which she said was made after consulting her family the move came 
despite newspaper polls that have shown high disapproval ratings 
for the governor 
because we love this state very much i indeed intend to 
run for governor mrs orr said friends and family sang happy 
birthday to the governor and presented her with a cake that said 
4 more for orr 
lee atwater gop national chairman has said the party has made 
mrs orrs reelection a priority four democrats have said they 
will enter the race including lincoln mayor bill harris and bill 
hoppner a former aide to sen bob kerrey dneb 
mrs orr defeated democrat helen boosalis in 1986 in the 
nations first gubernatorial race in which both major party 
nominees were women she was nebraskas first woman governor and 
the first gop woman elected governor in the nation 
the business community has hailed a major tax revision program 
she pushed through the legislature as providing tax incentives that 
have bolstered the economy critics have said the tax breaks will 
haunt the states fiscal future 
a revision of the individual income tax system caused a 
political blowup when despite mrs orrs protestations to the 
contrary it turned out to be a substantial tax increase mrs orr 
acknowledged a mistake was made and supported enactment of 
legislation intended to rectify the situation 
a series of court decisions involving the states controversial 
systems for taxing property and a furor over locating a lowlevel 
nuclear waste site in nebraska confronted mrs orr with more 
difficulty 
she has taken a strong antiabortion position and has 
acknowledged that abortion will be an issue in the 1990 campaign

using a series of 40 hidden cameras 
researchers have found a larger population of grizzly bears than 
previously believed inhabiting a section of national forest in 
northwestern montana 
the project was the first to use hidden cameras in a systematic 
fashion to document animals and identified dozens of other species 
near the south fork of the flathead river said tim manley a 
research assistant for the south fork grizzly study 
weve gotten pictures of just about every kind of wildlife 
said manley a biologist who invented the camera system weve 
gotten deer elk moose grizzlies black bears mountain lions 
coyotes wolverines fishers pine martens weve gotten a couple 
of archery hunters who waved at us 
south fork researchers began experimenting with photography in 
1988 and last summer used the 40 cameras 
the camera method also spread in 1989 to grizzly research in 
montanas yaak region and washingtons cascade range another 
montana biologist is using the cameras to study whitetail deer 
and the us forest service is interested in using them to document 
wolves 
such cameras also are being used to study an endangered nesting 
bird in hawaii and black bears in taiwan manley told the 
spokesmanreview and chronicle newspapers in spokane last week 
the 10year state and federal project in montana in its second 
year covers 320 square miles east of kalispell and south of 
glacier national park its main goal is to find accurate methods of 
counting grizzlies in the dense and mountainous terrain of the 
northern continental divide said rick mace of the montana 
department of fish wildlife and parks 
a reliable count is important because grizzlies are a threatened 
species and landuse decisions depend on their populations 
early on researchers identified 22 grizzlies by catching them 
in snare traps and fitting them with radio collars and ear 
streamers 
but the cameras enabled researchers to identify seven other 
grizzlies in a way that eliminated the need for human contact 
we identified individuals we had no idea were around mace 
said 
researchers said its too early in study to make any conclusions 
about the grizzly population and the effect that would have on 
management of the area 
each of the 35mm automatic cameras are housed in steel boxes 
along with infrared motion sensors from burglar alarms and 12volt 
batteries 
the bears are attracted by hanging bait usually roadkill deer 
placed out of their reach when they trip the motion sensor the 
camera takes a shot the time and date of the pictures shows up on 
each frame 
researchers found that 75 percent of the grizzly population in 
the area is female and they have confirmed seven births in the 
past two years 
however of the 22 bears collared by researchers six are known 
to have died

national city with just 70 residents has 12 officers to patrol 
the onemile stretch of illinois route 3 that bisects the village 
last year national city police wrote more than 5000 traffic 
tickets and earned more than 122000 for the village coffers 
onequarter of the overall budget 
the 35 mph limit is posted on at least eight signs on each side 
of the road assistant police chief jim farrell said tuesday 
you can hardly call it a speed trap because the speed limit 
is well posted he said 
the illinois department of transportation estimates 8700 cars 
daily pass through national city which is across the mississippi 
river from st louis and home to the national stockyards co 
livestock complex and related businesses 
its sort of like a racetrack out there at times farrell 
said we try to keep the traffic speed down and keep somebody 
from getting killed 
police began closely monitoring the highway five or six years 
ago after residents complained about the number of accidents 
farrell said 
county records show national city police wrote 5091 traffic 
tickets from jan 1 through dec 28 1989 most drivers were 
ticketed for speeding although some were cited for multiple 
violations 
those citations accounted for nearly 85 percent of the 60000 
movingviolation traffic tickets issued last year in st clair 
county which has a population of 265000 said barney metz county 
court clerk 
state police capt bobby henry area commander said he was 
surprised by the high number of tickets issued in national city 
thats not a negative comment he said for a small 
department theyre obviously out there working to get that many 
citations 
route 3 has a 30 mph limit as it enters national city from east 
st louis the speed limit then goes up to 35 mph and stays there 
as the road leaves national city 
police chief edward daubach said tickets arent issued unless 
drivers exceed the limit by at least 10 mph 
village clerk kathryn kuecker said national citys annual budget 
is about 400000 to 450000 with most of the revenue coming from 
property and sales taxes st clair county is one of the states 
most impoverished 
we really dont know how much would come in in a given year 
from traffic tickets kuecker said tuesday however the minimum 
penalty for a moving violation in illinois is 50 of which local 
authorities keep 24 that would mean national city received more 
than 122000 from the tickets issued last year 
the village with five fulltime and seven parttime officers 
is patrolled at all times by two officers in one car who use a 
radar detector 
officers have heard their share of excuses from speeders 
farrell said we had one guy tell us he was in a hurry to go home 
and take his medicine he said

us officials reached an agreement last month 
with china that will allow fugitive dissident fang lizhi to leave 
the us embassy in beijing and go into exile this month a 
magazine reported tuesday 
white house officials however dismissed the report and said 
there had been no new developments in the sixmonth impasse hes 
still in the embassy spokesman roman popadiuk said 
the chineselanguage pai shing magazine reported that the united 
states and china reached an understanding on resolving the 
dispute over fang when us national security adviser brent 
scowcroft visited beijing in december 
the magazine a leading publication in hong kong reporting on 
chinese affairs did not reveal any source for the article there 
was no immediate comment from the chinese government 
fang an astrophysicist who was chinas most outspoken dissident 
in recent years sought refuge in the embassy with his wife in june 
when authorities issued a warrant for their arrests as part of the 
crackdown on dissent 
the united states decision to shelter fang has been a 
significant factor in strained relations between the two countries 
since the military suppression of the spring prodemocracy movement 
in china 
pai shing said fang would leave the embassy before jan 27 the 
start of the chinese lunar new year and would most likely travel 
to australia although italy was also a possibility pai shing 
reported 
senior leader deng xiaoping approved the plan after the 
scowcroft visit the magazine said 
chinese leaders recently have appeared to ease their stand on 
fang saying the two countries needed to find a way to end the 
impasse communist party head jiang zemin said the deadlock could 
be resolved only if fang showed a very good repentant attitude 
but did not explain precisely what he meant

president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia who 
visited both germanys on tuesday said their reunification appears 
inevitable and can be a benefit to europe rather than a threat 
it is more important that germany maintains a democratic 
consciousness than whether it has 60 million or 70 million 
people he said as long as it remains peaceful and democratic 
it can be as large as it wants 
after short meetings with heads of state government leaders and 
opposition groups havel pledged solidarity with the prodemocracy 
movement in east germany 
his cautious comments on reunification reflected european fears 
of once more having such a powerhouse in the heart of the 
continent while acknowledging unity is a positive consequence of 
political reform 
after five hours in east germany including a ceremonial 
crossing through the berlin wall near the brandenburg gate havel 
flew to munich west germany for talks with president richard von 
weizsaecker and chancellor helmut kohl 
thousands of bavarians cheered as havel was driven through the 
city they shouted vaclav vaclav and freedom for east 
europe bravo vaclav 
at a joint news conference with the dissident playwright who 
became czechoslovakias president weizsaecker said the visit to 
munich proved we have come clean with our past 
it was in munich on sept 30 1938 that the pact was signed 
permitting hitler to annex the sudetenland of czechoslovakia 
bitterness between czechoslovaks and germans deepened after the 
war when czechoslovakia took the area back and expelled ethnic 
germans 
weizsaecker promised every support from west germany for 
czechoslovakia particulary to clean up the environment in an 
address to his nation on monday havel described his nations 
ecological condition as the worst in europe 
kohl said havels rise to the presidency epitomized the changes 
of the european spring a reference to the 1968 prague 
spring reforms in czechoslovakia that were crushed by a 
sovietled invasion 
he said havel would make an official visit to bonn the west 
german capital in late february or early march 
west germany has led efforts to aid eastern europe in its 
transition from stagnant economies and centralized communist 
governments seeking to form a bridge between east and west that 
would allow german reunification 
kohl has made his goal of reunification clear weizsaecker who 
has broad public support in both countries has been mentioned as 
possible head of state for an interim confederation 
during kohls visit to dresden in december the two german 
governments agreed to pursue closer official ties in what they call 
a treaty community 
west german conservatives like kohl view such relationship as a 
step toward reunification prime minister hans modrow of east 
germany on the other hand has said it preserves the sovereignty 
and separateness of his socialist state 
modrow said tuesday he took havels decision to visit both 
germanys on his first official trip abroad as a sign that 
czechoslovakia wanted to underscore the twostate nature of 
germany 
after his talks in east berlin with modrow and manfred gerlach 
the liberal democrat who is east germanys president havel 
acknowledged that reunification probably is a fact of european 
life he said germanys neighbors should try to make the process 
orderly not to prevent it 
the emotions on both sides must be reined in before formal 
steps toward reunification are taken he told a news conference 
it must be on the basis of negotiations not wild 
he made the comments including those about a reunited germanys 
size and democratic commitment in response to questions 
a single germany would have about 76 million people and an even 
stronger economy than that of west germany already the most 
powerful in europe 
havel said germans must ease fear of a mighty unified german 
state but called reunification a likely and positive consequence 
of improving relations among european states 
germans present the most extraordinary importance for the 
future of europe havel said and have been both the cause and 
the cure of europes major ills throughout this century 
the trip tuesday was havels first venture outside his own 
country in two decades 
just four months ago when the communists still ruled he was 
refused permission to visit west germany to collect a peace prize 
at the frankfurt international book fair he had refused to leave 
on other occasions for fear he would not be allowed to return

people suffered minor injuries which passengers said mostly 
resulted from shoving at emergency exits 
the american airlines jet with 247 passengers aboard and a crew 
of 10 landed at baltimorewashington international airport shortly 
after midnight said linda greene a spokeswoman for the maryland 
aviation administration which operates the airport

airport to new yorks laguardia airport when the pilot reported 
smoke in the cockpit the airline said the flight originated in 
acapulco mexico 
greene said no flames were seen aboard the plane passengers 
reported seeing light smoke wafting through the rear of the cabin 
susan kelly a spokeswoman for the fort worthbased carrier said 
she could not confirm those reports 
nine people were treated at north arundel hospital in glen 
burnie for sprains aches and bruises said kevin murnane hospital 
spokesman 
passengers said many of the injuries were caused when passengers 
pushed and shoved at two emergency exit doors in the middle of the 
aircraft where chutes opened properly but were reportedly caught on 
the wings 
passenger thomas glanville 31 of new york city said he saw 
very light smoke coming from the rear of the aircraft he said he 
was standing in line when it was learned that the chutes had 
wrapped around the wings 
it was then that several people became panicky and didnt know 
what to do or where to go glanville said 
according to kelly maintenance personnel at the airport said 
the planes chutes worked properly and that people often suffer 
ankle and back sprains from the sharp drop down an emergency chute

prevented them from dropping to the ground immediately 
the cause of the smoke was under investigation the plane was to 
be flown to chicago for further checking kelly said 
john nouaisser 34 of paris said he was seated near the rear

the threat to western europe posed by the 
warsaw pact is so diminished that us troops stationed there 
should be reduced by as much as a third sen carl levin said 
tuesday 
levin said the first phase of negotiations with the soviet union 
aimed at cutting the 300000 us troops in western europe to 
275000 should be followed immediately with a second round of 
negotiations to reduce force levels to about 200000 
we should make clear we are going to stay there for the 
forseeable future but that we want to do so at significantly 
reduced numbers said levin 
the winds of freedom have blown down the berlin wall and they 
are also blowing apart the warsaw pact he said 
the michigan democrat who is chairman of the senate armed 
forces subcommittee on conventional forces and alliance defense 
commented after returning from a visit to czechoslovakia and east 
and west berlin 
he said he was told by east german defense minister theodore 
hoffman that his countrys 1990 defense budget will be cut by about 
20 percent significantly deeper than the 10 percent reduction 
already announced 
a significant reduction in us force levels in western europe 
can now be made safely because the forces of the warsaw pact can no 
longer be relied on to join the soviet union in a cohesive attack 
on the west levin said 
the warsaw pact threat is literally unraveling he said 
referring to the rapid rise of anticommunist prodemocracy 
movements in poland hungary east germany czecholovakia bulgaria 
and romania 
levin said reductions in us forces in europe should be coupled 
with large cuts in the us defense budget and the savings applied 
to waging the war on drugs reducing the budget deficit improving 
education cleaning up the environment and aiding the newly 
emerging noncommunist government in eastern europe to prosper 
we can safely do it and we must do it levin said of the 
proposed defense spending cuts we must shift resources in a 
significant way 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the armed services 
committee also has called for restructuring and cutting back us 
forces in western europe 
levin noted that the first phase of conventional arms reduction 
talks should be completed in june 
we should not stop there he said the important point is 
that the new talks begin immediately so that the first phase is not 
seen as any kind of ending but as a beginning

romania joined the security council on 
tuesday and a senior romanian diplomat said it was his goal to 
give his nation more credibility in the international forum 
we respect our warsaw treaty obligations but we will 
energetically pursue consensus solutions sought by the 
international community on major regional conflicts said the 
senior diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity we want to 
cooperate 
romanias position could possibly coincide with the position 
of the united states on some issues in the general assembly the 
diplomat said 
we aim to give romania more international credibility and it 
will have more believability as it follows the democratic 
process he said 
romania took its seat with four other nations on the 15nation 
security council the most powerful un body the move came as 
part of a routine rotation 
romania replaces yugoslavia a founding member of the movement 
professing nonalignment with either superpower 
in other new positions on the council cuba replaced brazil the 
ivory coast replaced algeria democratic yemen replaced nepal and 
zaire replaced senegal 
the security council has five permanent members with veto power 
the united states britain china france and the soviet union it 
has 10 other nonpermanent members serving twoyear terms on a 
rotating basis representing various regions 
the other members of the council are canada colombia ethiopia 
finland and malaysia 
us officials said they expected the balance on the council to 
be roughly the same as in the past two years they indicated they 
expected cuba and probably yemen to be strongly antius but 
romania would be open in its relations with the west 
romanian officials noted that before the romanian revolution 
the government of nicolae ceausescu had opposed the warsaw pact 
invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and the soviet invasion of 
afghanistan in 1978 it also had refused to sever links with china 
in the 1960s 
romania also refused to allow warsaw pact troops to be stationed 
on its soil and had maintained ties with israel although relations 
were severed by the soviet union in 1967 during the middle east war 
the romanian mission to the united nations recently tore down 
all photographs of deposed dictator nicolae ceausescu and threw out 
his books the country also has removed the communist emblem from 
its flag and has changed its name to romania from the socialist 
republic of romania

charges they molested children at their familyowned mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach they are charged with 65 counts of 
molestation and conspiracy

as they came in said tuesday he would wait as long as possible to 
unseal the verdicts he said he would open the envelopes early only 
if there was imminent danger that one juror might drop out or if it 
appeared that deliberations were getting bogged down 
the verdicts are not final until they are read in court with all 
12 jurors confirming their votes 
the mcmartin case dates to 1983 when reports surfaced that 
children might have been molested at the prestigious nursery 
school seven teachers including buckey his mother grandmother 
and sister ultimately were arrested in 1986 after an 18month 
preliminary hearing district attorney ira reiner dismissed charges 
against five defendants saying there was insufficient evidence 
buckey and his mother were left to face drastically reduced 
charges in a trial that opened with jury selection in april 1987 
testimony began that july 
six alternate jurors originally were chosen but illnesses and 
job conflicts caused by the trials duration exhausted the supply 
of alternates and left only the minimum 12 jurors required for

a rome diplomatic source familiar with berloco agreed he was a 
natural choice 
you need someone with knowledge and skill the source said 
he has both 
the vatican official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
berloco could have an advantage coming from outside 
he would have clear instructions from vatican 
decisionmakers and he can afford to be much calmer the 
official said 
berloco will work with the papal nuncio jose sebastian laboa 
who the vatican says autonomously decided to take in noriega on 
grounds that the move would help end the fighting in panama 
with the option of noriega being given exile in a third country 
apparently diminishing negotiations reportedly are focusing on 
getting him to surrender to the new panamanian government the 
vatican says that under international law its embassy can only give 
up noriega to panama not a third country to which the mission is 
not accredited 
the impasse has been complicated by the apparent split among 
panamanian leaders over whether he should be prosecuted in panama 
or the united states 
attorney general rogelio cruz said he was preparing to file 
murder charges in panama against noriega but president guillermo 
endara said the country does not have the means to try him 
the vatican official suggested the best solution might be for 
the united states to offer the legal and security support to the 
panamanians so they can give him a fair trial at home 
this problem could have been resolved in any other country 
because they would have their own government the official said 
but in panama there is no government

the noncommunist government raised prices 
of bread sugar and other staples tuesday in the latest moves in a 
radical program intended to transform polands economy to 
capitalism 
but some workers who average 37 a month in salaries 
questioned whether they could endure the program the 
communistbacked trade union denounced the changes 
the increases came one day after the government quadrupled 
electricity rates and doubled the price of gasoline postal 
services and bus fares 
the price of flour rose 20 percent sugar about 25 percent and 
bread more than 50 percent the price of high quality ham a 
favorite cut in poland nearly doubled from 90 cents to 170 a 
pound 
the food prices are expected to increase from 25 percent to 50 
percent each month in the past steep food prices have triggered 
unrest 
i dont know how i am going to make it i guess i will have to 
work harder but even then the prices still keep going up said a 
teacher in warsaw 
there were short lines at many gas stations tuesday as people 
drove on tanks filled before the price increases or switched to 
public transportation 
the cars are just trickling in but they will be back people 
arent going to stop driving just because prices go up said a 
gasoline station attendant in central warsaw 
the new economic program calls for strict wage controls in order 
to check 900 percent inflation and transform the centrally planned 
economy to capitalism 
the communistbacked opzz trade union attacked the program 
saying the public had not been consulted and was insufficiently 
informed about the changes 
the opzz said it had submitted a list of questions to the 
government concerning the supply of consumer goods social services 
and income target production 
the opzz a harsh critic of the solidarityled government was 
once the only sanctioned trade union in poland it lost thousands 
of members after solidarity was legalized in april 1989 
the exchange rate of the currency the zloty was stable with 
the dollar tuesday as the official rate corresponded to the black 
market rate for the first time in memory 
the government hopes to achieve complete convertibility of the 
zloty by having the official and black market rates converge 
the national bank of poland has set the rate at 9500 zlotys to 
the dollar 
grzegorz wojtkowicz a vicepresident at the national bank of 
poland told the zycie warszawy newspaper tuesday that the 
government was determined to defend the new rate which resulted 
from a 38 percent devaluation announced last week 
government officials hope western credits and loans to a special 
currency stabilization fund as well as polands own modest hard 
currency reserves will be sufficient to support the currency 
the economic program developed by finance minister leszek 
balcerowicz has the support of many western goverments the world 
bank and officials of the european economic community 
balcerowicz has anticipated in coming months but stressed the 
increases were needed to halt polands 900 percent inflation to end 
its economic decline under more than four decades of communist rule 
in august solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki became prime 
minister the first noncommunist head of a government in eastern 
europe since then democratic reforms have swept the east bloc 
and noncommunists have been installed as presidents in 
czechoslovakia and east germany

the state departments secondranking official 
was sent to panama on tuesday for talks with president guillermo 
endara on ways for the united states to help recovery from two 
years of steep economic decline officials said 
meanwhile the white house announced that veteran diplomat deane 
hinton a leading state department expert on central america will 
replace arthur davis a political appointee as us ambassador to 
panama 
amid the diplomatic activity the administration remained silent 
on the status of talks concerning gen manuel antonio noriega who 
spent a ninth day at the vatican embassy in panama city 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher was asked 
repeatedly by reporters at a briefing whether deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger might take part in negotiations 
concerning noriega during his visit to panama city 
boucher declined to answer directly saying he would rather list 
the deputy secretarys full schedule of other activities and 
leave that to explain what mr eagleburger is doing 
at the same time roman catholic officials in rome said the 
vatican was sending a senior diplomat specializing in latin 
america monsignor giacinto berlocoto to panama city to give a 
hand to the vatican ambassador in the negotiations over noriegas 
fate 
boucher would say only that discussions were continuing and that 
the administration remained committed to bringing noriega to the 
united states to face drug trafficking charges 
in another development the organization of american states has 
agreed to accept the credentials of the endara governments nominee 
as oas ambassador lawrence chewning fabrega the oas had refused 
to seat chewning when it met shortly after the us military strike 
last month but the envoy said tuesday that the organization had 
little choice but to recognize that the new government is in 
effective control of the country 
at the state department boucher said the purpose of 
eagleburgers visit was to learn first hand from the panamanian 
leadership about their plans for economic recovery and to make 
recommendations to president bush on ways in which the united 
states can help

john robson and a team of policy experts the technical members of 
the team will remain in panama for a week to continue the economic 
discussions 
eagleburger and his colleagues will confer on wednesday with 
endara panamas two vice presidents and other prominent 
panamanians including leaders of the countrys business community 
the panamanian economy has been wracked not only by the heavy 
fighting that took place after the dec 20 us invasion but also 
by us economic sanctions dating back almost two years which 
were part of the us campaign against noriega 
of an estimated 370 million in panamanian assets frozen in the 
united states about 70 million has been returned to panama since 
the invasion boucher said 
among other sanctions the united states barred imports of 
panamanian sugar and prohibited panamanian participation in 
programs designed to enhance the countrys exports to the united 
states 
panama also had been dropped from a program to encourage us 
investment there us aid to panama was suspended in 1987 and all 
aid personnel were withdrawn late that year 
the new ambassadordesignate hinton 66 is currently 
ambassador to costa rica having served in the same post in el 
salvador from 198183 his nomination was interpreted by us 
officials as evidence of the importance the administration attaches 
to rebuilding us relations with panama 
davis the current ambassador to panama previously served as 
ambassador to paraguay he was pulled out of panama last may after 
noriega annulled the returns of the presidential election he went 
back immediately after the us military intervention

students will be allowed to use calculators 
next year for the first time on their math regents exams a state 
education department official said tuesday 
its an everyday situation where people have them theyre 
going to use them and were just going to acknowledge that said 
fred paul head of the departments mathematics bureau 
calculators are already allowed to check figuring on science 
regents examinations designed for collegebound high school 
students math students have long been permitted to use slide rules 
paul insisted the calculators wont be that much of an advantage 
for students since most of the regents test questions involve 
problemsolving students will still be required to show their work 
involved in reaching an answer he said 
students can use them to check addition subtraction 
multiplication and division he said 
calculators still wont be allowed for basic math proficiency 
tests at all grade levels he said those are areas in which 
students taking regents exams have already demonstrated their 
skills he said 
the national council of teachers of mathematics has endorsed the 
use of calculators for math classes and tests at all school levels 
according to a spokeswoman for the reston vabased organization 
calculators allow students to concentrate on the problemsolving 
process rather than on the calculations involved the council said 
while we dont have an official position im sure our members 
who are math teachers are supportive of the position its never 
come up as an issue said robert rice spokesman for new york 
state united teachers the states largest teachers union 
school districts will decide whether to provide calculators for 
students who cant afford their own paul said 
only calculators available for as little as 5 will be 
allowed in the regents exam he said more complex machines could 
give some students an unfair advantage he said 
calculators will first be allowed on the june 1991 math exams

the interim government said tuesday it 
had imprisoned about 60 of former dictator nicolae ceausescus 
closest associates and would punish all evildoers from the old 
regime 
foreign ministry spokesman constanin girbea said judgment also 
would follow for all members of the ceausescu family and the 
defense ministry would announce further details of punishments 
ceausescu and his wife elena were convicted of genocide and 
other grave crimes against romania and executed dec 25 
whether or where they were buried has not been disclosed but the 
official yugoslav news agency tanjug quoted girbea as saying they 
were probably buried on the spot 
girbea told a news conference all executive members of the 
communist party politburo were in prison 
i estimate there are about 60 all close colleagues of 
ceausescu he said all evildoers from the old regime will be 
brought to justice 
about 40 ceausescu relatives are thought to have occupied 
ranking government posts before the popular revolt that ended 
ceausescus 24year rule 
the ceausescus youngest son nicu and only daughter zoia 
were captured in the early days of the violent twoweek uprising 
that claimed thousands of lives 
girbea spoke to reporters hours after the national salvation 
front leadership announced the death of interim deputy foreign 
minister corneliu bogdan 
bogdan 68 died of a stroke late monday said government member 
sergiu nicolaescu who described romanias former ambassador to the 
united states as a man of honor and a very close friend 
bogdan had been one of several spokesmen for the interim 
government that took over after ceausescu fled his presidential 
palace on dec 22 
he served as ambassador in the united states from 1969 through 
1977 then returned to bucharest and later was named to a foreign 
ministry post involving western hemisphere relations said his 
stepdaughter svetlana hoge who lives in washington 
she said there was friction between bogdan and the ceausescu 
government and that bogdan left the ministry and was placed under 
what amounted to house arrest he was allowed to travel to 
washington in 1988 on a fellowship and remained in the united 
states until a month ago mrs hoge said 
in another development a member of the national salvation front 
and a principal architect of the revolution silviu brucan 
announced his organization would probably field its own candidates 
for elections in april 
the front originally had said it would not post candidates for 
the elections and brucan did not explain the change of policy in 
his televised speech late monday 
bucharest was calm tuesday there were no reports of sniper fire 
or clashes between the army and members of ceausescus hated 
securitate police which was officially disbanded monday 
hundreds of armed secret police agents were still believed at 
large 
the number of people killed in the uprising that toppled 
ceausescu was still unclear 
a spokesman for the international red cross in geneva juerg 
bischof said initial estimates that at one point reached 80000 
were far too high but the spokesman offered no total 
western diplomats in bucharest estimate that 7000 to 10000 
people have died 
according to a videotape of ceausescus trial the prosecution 
charged him with the death of more than 64000 victims during 
his 24year rule 
in his new years address interim president ion iliescu 
announced his governments first major changes to the mosthated 
legacies of ceausescus rule 
the changes announced monday included abolition of the death 
penalty reestablishment of private property and the opening of 
borders to former exiles 
on tuesday the romanian news agency agerpres was renamed 
rompres it was the latest organization to change its name to 
distance itself from ceausescus despotic reign

patrick kelly the mississippiborn designer whose 
bright sassy and feminine styles adorned the princess of wales 
bette davis and madonna died in a paris hospital his company said 
tuesday he was 35 
martine planterose managing director of kellys business said 
he died monday at hotel dieu hospital of bone marrow disease and a 
brain tumor 
kelly was the first and only american ever to become a member of 
the powerful chambre syndicale of readytowear and couture the 
french professional fashion organization 
his fitted feminine styles with signature touches like buttons 
or bows all over billiardball decor casual bandanas attracted 
attention ever since he came to paris in the late 1970s 
since 1987 kelly was backed by warnaco the american company 
that manufactures for names like geoffrey beene and dior 
his clothes have sold at saks bergdorf goodman marthas and 
elswhere in the united states and at the posh readytowear 
victoire store in paris 
newsweek magazine described the laidback american a downhome 
christian lacroix 
kelly was born sept 24 1954 in vicksburg miss where his 
mother was a schoolteacher dressed in outsized overalls dayglo 
running shoes tshirts and engineers caps he hardly looked the 
part of a typical parisian courtier 
but he always loved womens clothes ever since he admired the 
sundaybest dresses worn by the ladies of the vicksburg baptist 
church 
at a young age he prevailed on the family seamstress his aunt 
bertha to teach him how to sew and soon he was patching up 
clothes with whatever thread or mismatched buttons were at hand 
craving bigcity experience he headed for atlanta at age 18 and 
got a job delivering used clothes by chance he met top model pat 
cleveland who encouraged him to move up and out in fashion first 
to new york then to paris 
by 1979 he was broke but he accepted a oneway ticket to paris 
where he lived with a 6foot2 model named kim and sewed like a 
demon 
using borrowed sewing machines he ran up to 100 outfits a day 
using any fabric he could get his hands on his first were sold at 
the flea market or right off the fence around the church of 
stgermaindespres the only showplaces he could find 
the avantgarde bought his slightly funky fun outfits and in 
1985 the shop victoire ordered a few models 
he began to show on his own during the readytowear collections 
week and his shows were a hit accompanied by foottapping jazz 
or revival music 
then warnaco offered its backing in 1987 kelly was able to 
renovate an ancient building in the old marais quarter and move 
into a colorful shop and atelier there 
his clothes caught the eye of the fussy and discriminating 
chambre syndicale which in 1988 unanimously elected him a member 
of the readytowear branch of its 44 members at the time kelly 
was the only american and there were only 10 foreigners altogether 
not only the gimmicks sold kellys clothes they were 
wellfitted wellmade and the collections were versatile usually 
offering everything from sexy sparkly strapless sheaths for 
discodancers to more casual pantsuits dressy coats and suits 
with great attention to fabric and detail 
you can learn from everybody of all ages he told the 
associated press in an interview last year i saw a lot of old 
ladies at the flea market in leopard coats so i thought i gotta 
have spots and brought out a line of animal prints in my latest 
collection 
his famous clients come in all sizes and shapes madonna rock 
singer grace jones the princess of wales regine the nightclub 
queen and opera singer jessye norman one of his favorite clients 
and friends was bette davis for whom he lovingly turned out a 
batch of fried chicken during one of her trips to paris 
he said he was proud that his clothes suited women with fuller 
figures like my own mother as for sexy clothes its all in your 
mind 
beloved by the jet set and others kelly was invariably 
surrounded by friends in his shop or apartment 
his laidback ways generosity and funny fractured french 
endeared him even to the french who can be stuffy about foreigners 
who massacre their language 
ms planterose said the patrick kelly boutiques showroom would 
probably be kept going at least for a while as an exhibition of 
his art and work 
no funeral plans were announced

president bushs new budget will propose 
slashing by onefourth a program that helps the poor pay their home 
heating bills congressional sources said tuesday 
the low income home energy assistance program which is budgeted 
for 139 billion this year would receive 105 billion in the 
spending plan bush will present to congress later this month the 
sources said that is about what bush proposed last year 
the presidents budget proposals cover the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 and could not affect expenditures this winter 
the program helps about 61 million households in the country 
mainly by paying part of their heating bills small portions of it 
are used to help cover air conditioning and insulating expenses and 
to aid families in danger of losing their heating service 
spokeswoman barbara clay of the office of management and budget 
declined to comment on the proposal 
but advocates of initiatives for lowincome people said the cuts 
would damage a program that is already underfinanced 
this program has been cut enough over the last few years 
said ed block executive director of the national association of 
community action programs 
federal energy aid to the poor started shortly after the arab 
oil embargo in 1973 the program peaked in 1985 when it reached 
21 billion and served 68 million families and individuals 
the program was a favorite target for proposed reductions under 
former president reagans budget proposals in some years reagans 
budgets called for no appropriations at all on the grounds that 
refunds to the states from oil companies who overcharged when 
petroleum products were under price controls could provide all the 
needed money 
the program however has widespread support in congress which 
geenrally ignored reagans proposals bushs proposal is likely to 
be strongly opposed also last year bush proposed providing 11 
billion for the program but lawmakers ended up setting aside 139 
billion for it 
word of bushs plan comes after one of the coldest decembers on 
record a month in which heating oil prices shot up dramatically in 
some parts of the country in massachusetts for example heating 
oil costs surged from 88 cents per gallon a year ago to 141 per 
gallon last week 
supporters of the program said there is no way to predict how 
the proposed cuts if enacted would affect people who receive 
assistance the federal government funnels the money to the states 
which are free to set their own criteria for distribution in the 
past some states have responded to cuts by reducing the number of 
eligible recipients while others have shrunk the size of benefits 
the average participating household received 204 in heating 
assistance last year according to spokeswoman margot simmons of 
the department of health and human services which operates the 
energy assistance program 
program supporters say the benefits typically cover only about 
20 percent of a lowincome households annual energy bill

according to ctk ministry officials said the cases of an 
unspecified number of other prisoners would be reviewed 
havels amnesty applies to all prisoners except those indicted 
for abuse of authority by public officials 
that charge has been brought against miroslav stepan the former 
prague communist party boss considered responsible for violent 
police suppression of a student demonstration nov 17 which 
started a peaceful revolution that drove the communists from power 
in less than a month 
stepan and milos jakes the ousted national party chief were 
expelled from the party for serious political mistakes 
people convicted of terrorism murder rape and sexual abuse 
cannot be freed under the amnesty but it reduces their sentences 
by one year which could result in the release of those with less 
than a year left to serve 
sentences for other intentional crimes were reduced by at least 
two years and for crimes of negligence by at at least three years 
national television called it the broadest amnesty since the 
communists took power after world war ii 
a justice ministry official said privately about 15000 people 
convicted of minor offenses or awaiting trial would be the first 
released he did not give a breakdown of numbers of people 
imprisoned for the various types of crimes 
the amnesty took effect immediately after havel announced it and 
all prisoners eligible will be freed by jan 21 he said

president bush has named career diplomat deane 
hinton as ambassador to panama the white house announced tuesday 
hinton currently ambassador to costa rica replaces ambassador 
arthur h davis who was recalled by bush in protest of what the 
administration considered the stealing of the panamanian elections 
last may by gen manuel antonio noriega 
bush sent davis back to panama city after the dec 20 invasion 
of panama by us forces and installation of guillermo endara as 
president independent observers mostly concluded endara had won 
the elections by a hefty margin 
bush named hinton as a recess appointment because congress is 
not in session that means hinton can serve until the end of next 
year before he must go before the senate for confirmation 
the appointment of the 66yearold hinton with his long 
expierience on latin american issues is seen as a signal of the 
importance bush is placing on restoring normal relations with 
panama those relations steadily deteriorated after the united 
states indicted noriega once a ally particularly of the us 
intelligence community on drug trafficking charges in florida 
hinton has been ambassador to costa rica since 1987 before that 
he was ambassador to pakistan from 1983 to 1987 and ambassador to 
el salvador from 1981 to 1983 
he was assistant secretary of state for economic and business 
affairs from 1979 to 1981 and before that us representative to 
the 12nation european community headquartered in brussels a 
state department adviser on economic affairs and director and 
economic counselor of the state departments agency for economic 
development in chile and in guatemala 
davis a former state department consultant and former 
ambassador to paraguay was sent to panama by president reagan in 
1986 
bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was 
appropriate with the installation of a new government in panama 
said one administration official 
officials described hinton as an experienced latin america 
hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile 
developments in the south american country 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine called hinton highly qualified for the post because of his 
wideranging experience and expertise in central america 
however mitchell said he hoped bush would send the appointment 
to the senate after congress convenes jan 23 despite the nature of 
the recess appointment

a tip about an arms cache a missing 
diplomatic id card and a wrong address led to the us raid on the 
nicaraguan ambassadors residence that hurt already tense 
usnicaraguan relations us officials say 
about 80 us troops stormed the residence of nicaraguan 
ambassador antenor ferrey on dec 29 fired into the air and 
ordered everyone inside to evacuate 
they found weapons took money and clothes and ransacked the 
ambassadors office ferrey said us officials deny anything was 
taken and said the troops courteously apologized after they 
discovered they were on diplomatic ground 
even so nicaraguas leftist sandinista government expelled 20 
us diplomats from the us embassy in managua and ordered the 
missions largely nicaraguan administrative staff be reduced from 
320 to 100 
they acted arrogantly like rambos said nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega 
president bush called it a screwup and sent his apologies 
to managua but the state department said the sandinistas had 
seized an excuse to reduce us mission personnel in advance of 
elections scheduled for feb 25 
on tuesday nicaragua requested that a special meeting of the 
ruling council of the organization of american states be held 
thursday to consider what it termed the violation by the invading 
army of the united states 
a state department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the expulsion of nicaraguan embassy personnel from the united 
states is one option under consideration as a response to 
nicaraguas action 
us and nicaraguan officials have provided contrasting versions 
of what happened here is an account from witnesses and spokesmen 
for both sides 
since the overthrow dec 20 of gen manuel antonio noriega us 
troops had been searching for weapons panamanian citizens were 
tipping off us troops to arms caches to help crush the 
pronoriega resistance and to win a 5000 reward for such 
information 
the operation at the nicaraguan embassy residence apparently was 
launched by a us troop commander following up such a tip from an 
unidentified panamanian us officials said the tip gave the 
united states good cause to search the residence 
army lt col james swank a spokesman for the us southern 
command said the order was given by the battalion commander on 
the ground after we received a very good tip information that the 
address was the site of an arms cache 
swank said the troops demanded to be let in then fired in the 
air when the order was ignored apparently this was done despite 
the residences sign about the size of a manhole cover that 
identified a nicaraguan embassy residence 
a man drove up in his car claiming to be the nicaraguan 
ambassador and stating that this was his home swank said 
by ferreys account he arrived at his residence friday evening 
to find about 80 us troops outside they stopped him from 
entering 
ferrey said he told the troops they were surrounding his 
residence he demanded to speak to their commander and showed the 
colonel in charge his identification 
however southern command said in a statement that ferrey did 
not have the right id he produced a blue identity card instead 
of his red diplomatic identity card 
even so ferrey said the colonel radioed from a nearby jeep 
seeking confirmation that ferrey was telling the truth about 20 
minutes later he came back and told ferrey his superiors said the 
address was not registered as an embassy residence 
southern command said information from the us embassy 
indicated the ambassadors residence was in a highrise building in 
another neighborhood 
ferrey said he had moved from that residence more than a year 
ago southern command said it got its list of embassies and 
diplomatic residences from the us embassy 
the us embassy refuses to comment publicly but privately 
officials admit the list had the wrong address 
ferrey said he pointed to the sign identifying the residence 
arguing with the colonel he said those inside the residence had 
tried to put a call through to us ambassador arthur davis but 
couldnt get through 
ferrey said he demanded to be put in contact with davis but the 
soldiers refused to contact the us embassy 
ferrey said he was finally allowed to enter the residence he 
told the colonel the people inside would come out but he would not 
allow troops in 
the troops entered 
ferrey said he struggled with a soldier and they fell off the 
porch his sisterinlaw who was inside was trying to make a 
phone call she struggled with a soldier who ripped the phone cord 
from the wall he said 
the ambassadors brother the maid two visiting nicaraguan 
officials and a panamanian labor leader and his wife who were 
seeking asylum were inside 
about 30 soldiers entered and searched the house taking 
weapons clothing money and ransacking ferreys office he said 
us officials said the troops found 12 ak47 assault refiles 
four uzi submachine guns six rocketpropelled grenades and one 
light antitank weapon among other weapons 
ferrey told the troops he had a right to have arms inside the 
residence bush and other us officials agreed but questioned why 
an embassy residence would need such weapons as rocketpropelled 
grenades 
a senior us embassy official said the search was halted as 
soon as us officials confirmed the home was ferreys and 
diplomatically immune 
the troops had destroyed nothing returned all the seized 
weapons and withdrew said us officials 
ferrey said the troops returned everything except the money 
about 1000 the north americans are going to pay for the 
raid he said

prime minister yitzhak shamir agreed tuesday 
not to fire ezer weizman thus saving the government coalition but 
barred the science minister from the inner cabinet for his alleged 
secret contacts with the plo 
the compromise came less than two hours before the deadline for 
weizmans dismissal and involves a fundamental issue of israeli 
policy refusal to talk with the palestine liberation organization 
which israel officially calls a terrorist group 
it ended two days of crisis that threatened to bring down the 
national unity coalition of shamirs hardline likud bloc and 
the centerleft labor party of which weizman is a senior member 
in the occupied lands arab hospital officials said israeli 
troops shot and wounded 19 palestinians on tuesday including six 
children under age 14 
arab reporters said 16 were shot in the gaza strip 
in nablus on the west bank troops accidentally shot a 
10yearold palestinian boy in the leg with a plastic bullet and 
wounded two 14yearold boys an army spokesman said 
both incidents involved stonethrowing by palestinians he said 
shamir said sunday he would dismiss weizman on tuesday for 
having prolonged contacts with the plo in which the dovish minister 
allegedly gave advice on how to obstruct a secret israeli strategy 
worked out by the inner cabinet 
he said tuesday the compromise guarantees existence of the 
coalition government and serves as a severe deterrent to all those 
who dare to violate our laws and contact our worst enemies 
in baghdad iraq plo chairman yasser arafats political adviser 
said tuesday that shamir sent arafat a message a few a few months 
ago about a possible peace settlement in the middle east 
i wonder why shamir is making a lot of noise about weizmans 
contacts with the plo when he and other senior israeli politicians 
made similar contacts abu sharif told the associated press 
he said the prime ministers message dealt with efforts to start 
a dialogue leading to settlement of the 2yearold palestinian 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
a spokesman for shamir dismissed abu sharifs claim as utter 
nonsense 
the arafat adviser would not reveal the contents of the message 
or identify the intermediary abu sharif is known to have been in 
touch with israeli officials on behalf of the plo 
on sunday shamir said weizman acted in one mind with the 
plo on tuesday he summoned the minister to a meeting that lasted 
five minutes 
weizman said afterward the discussion was cordial and no 
evidence of contacts with the plo was presented 
this is a typically middle east israeli compromise said 
weizman 65 who advocates peace negotiations with the plo 
theres no admission of guilt here admission of guilt can be in 
court 
his labor superiors shimon peres party leader and vice 
premier and defense minister yitzhak rabin insisted on a 
compromise weizman said 
although weizman will remain as science minister in the 
26member cabinet he no longer will be admitted to the inner 
cabinet where government strategy is decided shamir will consider 
restoring weizman to the inner cabinet in 18 months 
weizman a former defense minister who defected from likud said 
he would leave as planned on wednesday for an official visit to 
moscow 
he denied newspaper reports he would meet with a senior plo 
official in the soviet capital 
cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein a top aide to shamir said 
weizman had promised to act according to the government decisions 
and guidelines barring contact with the plo 
rightwing parties criticized the compromise geula cohen a 
legislator from the tehiya party said it broadcast to all the 
world that israel is ready to negotiate with the plo 
leftists said the affair showed there could be no peace without 
the plo and prominent palestinians said it demonstrated israels 
unwillingness to compromise 
weizman said peres and rabin were aware of his contacts with 
palestinian leaders abroad through ahmed tibi an israeli arab 
physician 
peres said it was legitimate to meet with tibi who was not a 
plo member

president bush girding for his partys 1990 
struggle to regain control of congress on tuesday rallied 
republican troops still smarting from offyear setbacks at the 
hands of the democrats 
weve got a great big job ahead of us bush told 200 
republican national committee workers the party is on the move 
i am confident that this will be a great year a republican year 
it was an upbeat appearance before the party rankandfile who 
were rocked by gop losses in several key state races and special 
congressional elections in 1989 
bush also used the brief political appearance to urge congress 
to pass a capital gains tax cut anticrime package and clean air 
bill in the new year 
for bush it was what he called a nostalgic return to rnc 
headquarters where he toiled as party chairman during 197374 when 
the republicans were reeling from the watergate scandal 
when i went back up to the fourth floor it was like yogi 
berra said deja vu all over again bush joked 
some things never do change except of course the muzak 
said bush referring to gop chairman lee atwaters switch to rhythm 
and rock for the pipedin music instead of the more traditional 
instrumental fare 
the democrats won six of eight special house elections during 
1989 atwaters first year as gop chairman 
the democrats captured an indiana house seat once held by dan 
quayle and a mississippi seat that had been in gop hands for a 
decade the republicans did capture the miami seat held for years 
by the late rep claude pepper the democratic dean of congress 
the democrats also celebrated widely noted election victories in 
governors races in virginia and new jersey where they capitalized 
on their republican opponents opposition to abortion they also 
held the house seats of former speaker jim wright in texas and 
majority leader tony coelho in california despite their exits from 
congress under ethical clouds 
rep beryl f anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said in an interview ninety 
looks very positive for us i think weve outrecruited the 
republicans once again 
the real battleground is what happens in state and local 
elections the 1992 redistricting is the real battleground for the 
house of representatives said anthony 
bush who has already begun campaigning for gop senate hopefuls 
in illinois rhode island and iowa is expected to campaign 
extensively this year according to leslie goodman the rncs 
director of communications 
she said 1989 was a year we have to look back on and say 
this is what we dont want to do next year were not going to 
let ourselves get boxed in on an issue like abortion 
atwater 38 an architect of bushs hardhitting 1988 victory 
over democrat michael dukakis gave the president a belated 
christmas present on tuesday a framed picture depicting the more 
than 160 democrat elected officials who switched parties in the 
past year including two congressmen 
thats marvelous said the president 
bush addressed the gop workers at the capitol hill club adjacent 
to rnc headquarters 
this years elections will be the last before house seats are 
reapportioned based on the decennial census the gop is hoping to 
gain strength from seats certain to be switched from frost belt to 
sun belt states after the census 
thirtyfour senate seats are up this year 18 now held by 
republicans and 16 by democrats two republicans bill armstrong 
in colorado and gordon humphrey in new hampshire have already 
announced they are not seeking reelection 
the democrats control the senate now 5545 
in the house the democrats have an 83seat margin 259176 
the democrats picked up seats even as bush was keeping the white 
house in republican hands in 1988 
we would anticipate that the president will do what presidents 
do best which is raising money said anita dunn spokeswoman for 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee which expects to be 
outspent 4to1 by its republican counterpart it was in 1988 66 
million to 16 million 
were anticipating a very hard fought midterm election she 
said weve picked up senate seats in the last three election 
cycles were fighting to hold our own in 1990

thousands of couples have been telephoning 
charities and adoption agencies in britain asking how to adopt 
orphans from romania the agencies said tuesday 
pictures of overflowing romanian orphanages the result of the 
late dictator nicolae ceausescus policies prohibiting abortion 
birth control and family planning information for women with fewer 
than five children were broadcast by british tv monday night 
the flanders scottish alliance an edinburghbased war charity 
reported 2000 calls since new years eve from couples desperate to 
adopt 
barbara mostyn of the support group stork said the group has 
been receiving calls all day the swansea walesbased 
international family support group said it received calls from 40 
to 50 couples 
i am truly shocked said kevin earnshaw a member of the 
flanders scottish alliance who returned from a fiveday tour of 
bucharest orphanages monday night and spoke about his trip on the 
radio 
its been absolute chaos the phones have been going nonstop 
there are obviously a lot of childless couples in britain but 
ive had americans offering me all sorts of money for a baby he 
said 
there are countless thousands of orphans in homes throughout 
romania and at least 4000 in the capital alone he said 
earnshaw and ms mostyn of stork said there were no procedures 
yet for adopting romanian orphans 
we are worried that people might feel they can just rush 
straight there but as under ceausescu none of the orphans were 
allowed to be adopted abroad i assume there is no system for 
adoption which i find worrying ms mostyn said 
meanwhile earnshaw said we are appealing for funds for 
medicinal and pediatric aid to be airlifted to the orphans

construction spending hit a 10month high in 
november the government reported tuesday and an analyst 
attributed the jump to lower interest rates and to rebuilding after 
hurricane hugo and the san francisco bayarea earthquake 
i think a reasonable argument can be made that some of the 
government spending was disaster related said david berson 
chief economist for the federal national mortgage corp 
a 7 percent gain in government spending helped push total 
outlays up 15 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4217 billion the commerce department reported it was the 
highest level since last januarys 423 billion 
hurricane hugo hit the south carolina coast sept 21 while the 
earthquake struck northern california on oct 17 
berson said the government sector had been growing strongly 
since july so not all of the advance should be attributed to the 
disasters government spending totaled 914 billion on an annual 
rate 
residential spending increased 06 percent to 1944 billion 
on an annual rate helped by a 15 percent gain in singlefamily 
housing and a 47 percent jump in apartment building 
what were seeing here is a response by builders to lower 
mortgage rates and increased sales berson said were likely 
to see that edging up for the next several months but i dont think 
were going to see any surges because builders will remain very 
cautious 
the federal reserve began letting shortterm interest rates fall 
gradually in june as inflation moderated and the economy showed 
signs of sluggishness the central bank had propped up the rates 
initially to stem inflationary pressures 
by the end of november fixedrate mortgage rates were 974 
percent according to a survey by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp they had peaked at 1122 percent in march 
despite lower interest rates construction of nonresidential 
buildings was down 07 percent to 1007 billion on an annual rate 
berson attributed the decline to overbuilding particularly in 
office buildings in recent years 
industrial construction advanced 17 percent to 181 billion 
which berson said was good news for the economy because it 
increases productive capacity 
with exports remaining pretty strong i think well see 
industrial building continue to expand he said 
the total construction figure was up 15 percent from the level 
of building a year ago

a third town in central ethiopia in their drive southward toward 
addis ababa the capital 
the rebels have been fighting since 1974 to oust the marxist 
government of president mengistu haile mariam 
the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front said in a 
secret radio broadcast monitored in nairobi that its fighters 
captured the town of jihur after launching a fierce offensive

rebel casualties the rebels had claimed that the government lost 
more than 8000 dead wounded or captured in the earlier fighting

addis ababa said previous rebel claims appeared to be accurate 
the front is a combined force of the tigre peoples liberation 
front and the smaller ethiopia peoples democratic movement

a hungarian fairy tale has become a reallife 
moneymaker at specialty theaters since the film was first shown in 
the united states in museums a little over a year ago 
an allegory about individuals struggling for identity in a 
bureaucratic world the 1987 film by gyula gazdag was released 
commercially in this country late in 1988 
the movie is back in boston for an openended run and is 
getting a marketing boost from the popular revolts in eastern 
europe that have dominated headlines in recent months 
with just three copies of the film shown in 26 weeks worth of 
screenings it has taken in more than 110000 in ticket sales 
said morton wax of the new yorkbased distributor md waxcourier 
films 
its a great film said bo smith film coordinator at the 
boston museum of fine arts its timely anybody looking at it 
with the headlines in their mind will see how much this artist 
dealt with what was happening before it happened 
this is a very subversive film indeed 
gazdags films have been suppressed in the past for up to 12 
years at a time the very making of a hungarian fairy tale was 
a measure of the new freedoms in hungary 
gazdag who is teaching two semesters of filmmaking at the 
university of california los angeles said in a telephone 
interview tuesday that the reception gratified and surprised him 
i didnt expect that american audiences can be sensitive for a 
small blackandwhite subtitled hungarian movie so perhaps there 
is something else in the film 
as the 42yearold director put it its about looking for an 
identity and thats whats going on in eastern europe right now 
in the week that ended nov 29 the film ranked no 39 on 
varietys list of 50 top grossing films in terms of average sales 
per screen a hungarian fairy tale made of 9000 that week on 
the lone screen surveyed according to variety 
although that is small change for a hollywood blockbuster it is 
noteworthy for a foreign fable by a oncesuppressed director said 
erica max managing director of coolidge corner theater foundation 
which is showing the movie 
its a very important indication of how much strength a film 
has max said 
the film tells the story of an orphan boys search for a father 
he has never known without a father the boy cant officially 
exist as far as a local town clerk is concerned 
the movie spins its tale with surrealistic flourishes when the 
civil servant who denied the boy an identity ends up burning the 
contents of his file cabinet he gets locked up in an insane asylum 
then the excivil servant and a nurse who quits the asylum team 
up with the boy in the end they escape the bureaucratic madness 
by taking flight on a huge magic bird 
the film opened at the coolidge on dec 22 business has been 
slow because of the holidays max said but attendance should climb 
as word gets out 
by the end of the run it will be doing very well max 
predicted its an extraordinary film that has a great 
reputation 
the film was first seen in this country in special showings at a 
few museums said smith the boston museums film coordinator 
smith invited reviewers when the museum showed the film in july 
1988 their enthusiastic reception convinced morton wax it could be 
a boxoffice success and he became its distributor

a drunken drugusing soviet mob rampaged for 
three days on the iranian frontier wrecking buildings and 
communications threatening to kill border guards and trying to 
enter iran illegally it was reported tuesday 
the unprecedented barbarous actions in the azerbaijani 
enclave of nakhichevan caused millions of dollars in damage the 
tass news agency said 
it was the latest spasm of violence in the soviet caucasus 
inflamed the past two years by strife among azerbaijanis 
armenians georgians and other ethnic groups 
elsewhere in azerbaijan police cadets tuesday fired on a crowd 
attacking a convoy with stones and firearms in the predominantly 
armenian city of stepanakert tass reported one person was killed 
and three wounded that incident took place in the disputed 
nagornokarabakh region a flashpoint of ethnic hatreds between the 
neighboring republics of azerbaijan and armenia since february 1988 
tass said the spree of destruction in nakhichevan 1200 miles 
south of moscow began sunday and continued until tuesday it 
blamed extremist forces but gave few clues as to their motives 
the crowd high on drugs or alcohol rampaged along a 
distance of more than 85 miles of the nakhichevan part of the 
sovietiranian border destroying or burning buildings 
communications lines poles and border signs tass said 
threats were also heard to burn down the border stations and 
kill the border guards personnel and their families tass said 
in its dispatch also read on the evening television news program 
vremya tass said irresponsible elements were trying to 
aggravate tensions in azerbaijan and the caucasus as a whole but 
was not more explicit 
tass said some people were trying to cross the border into iran 
illegally indicating the crowd in nakhichevan was probably 
azerbaijani the only soviet ethnic group who like iranians are 
largely shiite moslems 
vagiv samedoglu editor of the azerbaijan peoples front 
newspaper said by telephone from baku azerbaijans capital that 
for nearly a month soviet azerbaijanis had been camped out along 
the border with iran in hopes of seeing relatives and friends on 
the other side 
about 4 million ethnic azerbaijanis live in the adjoining 
iranian province of azerbaijan alone their soviet kin want an open 
border and the freedom to trade and cross the frontier for personal 
visits practices that were suspended by dictator josef stalin 
samedoglu said 
he said the tass report of attacks by drunken 
narcoticsinfluenced mobs was a lie written in moscow 
a rally was held sunday in baku to demand a free border with 
iran and on tuesday pickets renewed the call in front of 
azerbaijans interior ministry headquarters and supreme soviet 
legislature samedoglu said 
tass also charged the organizers of the melee were trying to 
destabilize the border region and provoke a brutal response 
from authorities but did not say why attempts to secure 
information from azerbaijans official news agency azerinform 
were not successful telephones rang unanswered tuesday night at 
its headquarters in baku 
disruptions caused by the mobs attack continued along the 
sovietiranian border tass said 
constant attempts are being made to freely cross the border 
into iranian territory it said as a result of such actions 
the functioning of border services has become extremely difficult 
soviets attempting to exit the country must submit to checks at 
the frontier by the special border troops unit of the kgb before 
being given permission to leave 
iranian media monitored in nicosia cyprus had no immediate 
report on the threeday rampage but tass said worried iranian 
border commissioners issued a protest saying the actions by 
extremist elements are insulting to iran and requesting the 
soviets act to quell the disorders 
violence broke out in the 2200squaremile azerbaijani enclave 
between armenia and iran in november 1988 when armenian media 
reported gangs of azerbaijanis had ransacked armenian residents 
homes in nakhichevan 
many ethnic armenians who were among nakhichevans more than 
235000 residents then fled to armenia joining refugees from 
nagornokarabakh and azerbaijan itself who felt threatened because 
of ethnic attacks sparked by the continuing territorial dispute 
over nagornokarabakh nagornokarabakh is a predominantly armenian 
enclave inside azerbaijan 
tass said a bus convoy of azerbajanis being escorted by internal 
security troops between the cities of agdam and shusha was stoned 
and fired on in stepanakert on tuesday cadets from the police 
school for purposes of selfdefense returned the fire tass 
said 
in the shootout four stepanakert residents were wounded and 
one of them died tass said some azerbaijanis aboard the buses 
also were injured when the convoy arrived in the azerbaijani city 
of shusha 5000 people formed to even the score but 
reinforced internal security troops prevented further strife tass 
said 
in the azerbaijani town of dzhaliabad the local communist 
party chief was injured in a clash last week between police and 
demonstrators demanding his ouster said savili a perets deputy 
director of azerinform in a telephone interview earlier tuesday 
from baku 
tass said mobs rampaged in the city near the iranian border and 
the caspian sea coast friday placing women and children in front 
of them as a shield they stormed the offices of the party district 
committee and the police station tass said roads were blockaded 
and enterprises shut down 
tass said authorities acted to unblock the roads and dismantle 
tents set up by demonstrators perets said one protester was 
wounded by gunfire and more than 20 others and 60 policemen injured 
by other means 
protesters also wounded the top party official in the town 
kherula aliev whom they accused of inattention to social and 
economic problems perets said he said aliev was taken to baku for 
treatment 
tass said tuesday night the situation there remained tense

prime minister anibal cavaco silva 
replaced five ministers in his centerright government tuesday two 
weeks after his social democratic party suffered heavy losses in 
nationwide municipal elections 
those dismissed include eurico de melo defense minister and 
deputy premier and finance minister miguel cadilhe architect of 
the economic liberalization program 
cavaco silva also replaced health minister leonor beleza 
agriculture minister alvaro barreto and jose silveira godinho 
minister for internal administration 
all five were leading figures in the government formed after the 
party won general elections in 1987 with the first parliamentry 
majority since a 1974 revolution ended 48 years of authoritarian 
rightwing rule 
tuesdays action was the first major change in the team cavaco 
silva recruited to reduce state control and modernize the country 
to fit in with the european community which portugal joined in 
1986 as the poorest member 
news reports said de melo resigned both his positions when 
cavaco silva decided to replace the other four because of the loss 
to the opposition socialist party in municipal elections dec 17 
socialist officials dismissed the cabinet realignment as 
changing faces but not policies 
cavaco silva presented five new ministers to president mario 
soares who must approve the appointments they include miguel 
beleza brother of the outgoing health minister who is to replace 
cadilhe 
despite strong economic growth since the 1987 election high 
inflation and cadilhes abrasive style made him the least popular 
minister in opinion polls a parliamentry enquiry last year 
rejected allegations that he had evaded taxes 
miguel beleza a director of the bank of portugal supports 
government plans to sell stateowned companies and reduce controls 
on the economy 
officials did not reveal cavaco silvas choice as deputy prime 
minister but government spokesman fernando lima said carlos brito 
would replace de melo as defense minister 
brito lost the race for mayor of oporto in the december 
elections in which the socialists got 32 percent of the vote 
nationwide 1 percent more than the social democrats

the panama canal was on the verge of 
closing under gen manuel antonio noriega but the mighty muscle 
of the us army should guarantee it runs smoothly from now on 
the canals new administrator said tuesday 
i saw with great anguish what was happening in panama said 
fernando manfredo acting administrator of the 50mile waterway 
i was horrified foreseeing that the deteriorating situation 
between the united states and panama would result in the closure of 
the canal 
although panamanians make up 86 percent of the canals work 
force manfredo is the first panamanian to run the shipping route 
since it began operations 75 years ago he took over monday under 
the terms of the 1977 treaty that gives the canal to panama in the 
year 2000 
manfredo and other canal officials said harrassment by the 
noriega government was causing morale problems among the canals 
8000 employees and forcing key canal workers to quit 
it was getting hard to sustain the standards necessary to keep 
the canal competitive manfredo said at a news conference at 
canal headquarters 
he said the dec 20 us invasion that toppled noriegas regime 
restored faith among canal employees 
that resolved a series of problems affecting canal workers and 
which in my opinion was threatening to close the canal at any 
moment because the morale of workers had hit bottom said 
manfredo 
he said the mighty muscle of the us army is the best 
guarantee of the canals future operations and neutrality 
i think the canal is more protected now than ever he said 
manfredo deputy administrator for the past 10 years was named 
acting administrator because the new government of president 
guillermo endara has not yet nominated a permanent head 
he said endara has not asked him to fill the post permanently 
and refused comment when asked if he wanted the job on monday 
endara said manfredo could be named to the post 
the us senate and president bush must approve the choice an 
american will be named deputy administrator a move that does not 
require presidential or senate confirmation 
meanwhile raymond laverty and joseph wood two former 
executives at the canal are sharing the duty 
laverty said he expects latin american nations to continue using 
the canal even though many countries were against the invasion and 
do not recognize the endara government 
laverty said few countries have an alternative shipping route 
and the use of the canal is an economic rather than a political 
issue he cited the example of ecuador where the banana industry 
supports 500000 people and where twothirds of its banana crop 
goes through the canal 
laverty said there were only a handful of instances where 
shippers canceled plans to use the canal because of the invasion 
which closed the waterway for less than two days 
he said many shippers delayed shipments until the canal opened 
and that the backlog which reached 150 ships at one point is 
about half of that now 
manfredo said panama and the united states are studying the 
possibility of investing in increasing canal capacity such as 
widening the gaillard or culebra cut the narrowest part of the 
waterway 
the cost of the project has been estimated at 400 million but 
manfredo said the money could not be recovered through canal tolls 
by the year 2000 
other possibilities discussed in recent years include adding 
another set of locks which raise and lower the ships across the 
canal he said 
the existing canal is fed by fresh water and rises to about 85 
feet above sea level at its highest point requiring the locks for 
transit 
there has been occasional talk of a new salt water canal built 
at sea level but costs engineering problems and environmental 
considerations are considered enormous

mladenov who replaced zhivkov on nov 10 has promised reforms and 
free elections 
in kurdjali a committee for the defense of national interests 
was formed last week including communists and noncommunists 
it demands a referendum on the minorities issue and sent a 
declaration to parliament saying the leadership with the new 
policies had once again taken categorical and irreversible 
decisions forced its dictates on the popular opinion 
representatives of the communist party and oppostion should 
visit the region and learn about the issue where it is 
particularly acute the committee said according to bta 
the statement brought to sofia by a convoy of 200 cars said 
the committee would call a general warning strike friday if it did 
not receive a satisfactory response

with neighbors of the fernald uranium processing plant who sued 
over radioactive emissions 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals in cincinnati issued an 
order tuesday dismissing the department of energys appeal the 
order allows the energy department to allocate money for the 
settlement which would permit longterm medical monitoring of 
people living near the plant 
the plant located 18 miles northwest of cincinnati is owned by 
the energy department and processes uranium for the governments 
production elsewhere of nuclear weapons the department 
acknowledged in 1985 that tons of radioactive uranium dust had 
leaked from the plants exhaust filters into the environment

department in washington said tuesday that the departments 
lawyers will meet soon with the fernaldarea residents attorney

a federal judge tuesday ordered special 
elections in may for nearly onethird of the states district 
judges saying the power of minority voters in nine counties has 
been diluted by atlarge elections 
us district judge lucius bunton of midland said his plan for 
nonpartisan elections was needed because the governor and 
legislature have failed to change the countywide election system 
since he ruled it discriminatory in two months ago 
a further delay of implementation of any solution by the 
legislature would not be in the interest of justice would further 
dilute the rights of minority voters in the counties in question 
and would be inequitable and work an even greater hardship on the 
judges and courts involved he said 
gov bill clements called for an immediate appeal of the judges 
order he said he supported elections without party lines but he 
claimed that putting buntons plan into effect before an appeal is 
heard would create wholesale upheaval in the texas judiciary 
not only would this be chaotic it would result in the loss of 
qualified and experienced judges who are now on the bench 
clements said 
attorney general jim mattox said his office was reviewing the 
judges order and considering an appeal he expressed 
disappointment over the ruling and said both the state house and 
senate support partisan elections 
i still feel strongly that the legislature is the proper forum 
to solve the problem and i wish the judge had heeded the expressed 
intent and wishes of the legislature mattox said 
the judges decision covers only the 115 judgeships out of the 
172 in the nine counties up for election this year officials said 
those positions were to be filled as part of the states normal 
election process with party primaries in march and the general 
election in november 
overall the state has 375 district judges 
john t garcia texas director of the league of united latin 
american citizens which sued to overturn the judicial election 
process in the nine counties praised the ruling 
we now feel minorities have the opportunity to be elected 
to the judiciary garcia said we believe with the districts 
cut up into subdistricts we will have better representation in the 
judiciary which is something that is long overdue for minorities 
under buntons order nonpartisan balloting in the nine counties 
would be held within existing political subdivisions such as state 
house districts justice of the peace precincts and county 
commissioner precincts 
the special judicial elections would be for fouryear terms 
ron dusek spokesman for mattox said the judges plan would 
take effect unless the legislature acts before may to change 
atlarge voting 
state officials including clements had asked for more time 
but bunton said quick action was needed 
he said his interim plan is what law equity and justice 
require 
buntons order covers district court judges in the counties of 
bexar which includes san antonio dallas harris houston 
travis austin tarrant fort worth jefferson lubbock ector 
and midland counties 
the judge ruled in november that countywide voting violated the 
voting rights act of 1965 at that time nonhispanic whites held 
155 of the 172 district judge seats in the nine counties 
blacks and hispanics make up about onethird of the states 
population 
the judge noted that his discrimination ruling sparked political

fighting between two tamil groups in the northern vavuniya 
district vacated last week by indian troops officials said 
tuesday 
military officials in colombo said at least 18 guerrillas of the 
proindia peoples liberation organization of tamil eelam were 
killed in an attack by the dominant liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam 
at least three tamil tiger militants also were killed in the 
clash that started monday and continued early tuesday said the 
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
they said the fighting erupted after the tamil tigers attacked a 
peoples liberation organization camp at chettikulam village about 
135 miles north of colombo 
earlier tuesday president ranasinghe premadasa appealed for 
peace in his troubled nation where more than 17000 people have 
been killed since 1983 in sri lankas twin ethnic wars 
premadasa who completed one year in office tuesday said in 
this new year and the new era let us join hands let us also join 
hearts to rededicate ourselves to reunite our motherland to 
further the cause of peace discipline and prosperity 
premadasas one year in office has been marked by daily killings 
inspired by tamil militants in north and eastern sri lanka and 
sinhalese guerrillas in the south and the center of the country 
fighting between tamil tigers and the peoples liberation 
organization and its ally eelam peoples revolutionary liberation 
front escalated after india announced in september it was speeding 
up the withdrawal of its peaceekeeping troops

group here they comprise 75 percent of the 16 million populace and 
control the government and the military

population tamil militants said they needed a separate homeland to 
preserve their culture and thwart what they said was discrimination 
by the sinhalese majority

men lose roughly 2 percent of their 
existing bone mass per year in the same type of loss that can 
severely affect women after menopause a study indicates 
there is a problem with osteoporosis in men that hasnt been 
appreciated its a problem that needs to be recognized and 
addressed said dr eric orwoll who led the study by the oregon 
health sciences university 
men apparently suffer gradual bone loss throughout their lives 
compared with women who often suffer a marked increase in bone 
loss after they reach menopause orwoll said in an interview 
tuesday 
researchers believe bone loss in women is related to the 
decrease in estrogen levels associated with menopause but no one 
has studied whether hormonal levels also affect bone loss in men 
he said 
the major point of our study was that contrary to popular 
belief there is significant bone loss in men as they grow older 
orwoll said 
the study was published in the jan 1 issue of the annals of 
internal medicine 
the threeyear study which orwoll said was the first of its 
kind nationally measured the loss of bone from the lumbar 
vertebrae or the lower spine and the forearm the 77 men studied 
ranged in age from 30 to 80 
the bone loss was detected at all ages and the 2 percent rate 
did not appear to vary orwoll said 
if you think of that relatively simplistically you wouldnt 
have any bone left after 50 years orwoll said the key is 
existing bone mass that means a man may lose half of his vertebral 
bone mass in a lifetime 
thats pretty dramatic and as yet pretty speculative so i 
dont want to leave the wrong impression he added 
orwoll said that the skeleton is constantly being broken down 
and rebuilt which doctors call remodeling eventually the 
entire skeleton is rebuilt several times during a lifetime he said 
the problem in bone loss is that not enough new bone is put 
back when old bone is taken up orwoll said 
he said that calcium and vitamin d supplements given some of the 
men in his study did not slow the bone loss however orwoll 
pointed out that all the men in the study were healthy and 
wellnourished which could mean that calcium supplements may help 
men with poor diets 
the major effect of bone loss is to increase the brittleness of 
bones making them easier to break he said 
fractures definitely increase orwoll said if you look at 
the data on broken hips the incidence goes up dramatically for 
women from age 50 to 60 
women generally suffer twice as many hip fractures as men he 
said but men are increasingly prone to fractures as they reach 
their 70s and 80s

a bomb planted in a federal bureau of 
indian affairs office blew out windows and doors and ripped out the 
floor tuesday but no one was injured authorities said 
the 530 am blast was the second indianrelated bombing in 
riverside county in four days but authorities found no immediate 
link with a bombing that damaged an office on the morongo indian 
reservation early friday 
the bureau blast which also damaged an adjacent office in the 
building near downtown was investigated by the fbi and riverside 
police department 
we dont know what kind of bomb said fbi spokesman jim 
neilson 
he declined to say whether the office had been the target of any 
threats but police spokesman pete esquivel said that possibility 
was being investigated 
the bureau office is 30 miles from the morongo indian 
reservation one of several reservations in the area 
the twostory building houses several offices and some of the 
adjacent ones were damaged by objects hurled through the walls 
esquivel said 
it was a fairly large explosion judging by the structural 
damage to the building he said a damage estimate was not 
immediately available 
the previous bombing occurred about 2 am dec 29 but was not 
discovered until 745 am when workers arrived at a business 
office of the morongo band of mission indians near banning said 
sheriffs capt jake bowser 
the explosive was a pipe bomb but bowser could not release any 
other information about the device it was powerful enough to kill 
but the bomber may have sought to avoid that by striking at the 
early hour 
what you can derive from this is if they wanted to injure 
someone it would have been timed different he said 
there were no known witnesses and both bomber and motive 
remained unknown authorities said there were no threats before 
the bombing 
in the southeast a recent string of mail bombings have killed a 
judge and a civil rights attorney federal officials said the 
bombings may have been carried out by a group with a grudge against 
the naacp and the 11th us circuit court of appeals

more than 71000 jews left the soviet union in 
1989 the highest annual figure since the national conference on 
soviet jewry began keeping track of the emigres in 1968 the 
organization said tuesday 
of the 71196 jews who left the soviet union last year 12056 
went to israel according to the soviet jewry research bureau of 
the ncjs nearly all the others were bound for the united states 
some 10000 to 20000 remain in italy awaiting permission to 
come here most of the rest have already arrived and a small 
percentage went to other western european countries canada or 
australia said mark levin associate executive director of the 
ncsj in washington 
although only 17 percent of the soviet jewish emigres overall 
went to israel last year 41 percent of the 8680 who left the 
soviet union in december went to israel 
we see this as a very positive trend in jewish emigration and 
welcome it as an integral part of the reawakening of jewish 
consciousness now underway in the ussr said shoshana s 
cardin chairwoman of the ncsj in a statement 
most israelbound jews leaving the soviet union must travel 
through romania austria or hungary but among those who left in 
december 125 did so on the first el al israel airlines charter 
flight ever to fly out of moscow levin said 
its all part of the steps to lead to the resumption of full 
diplomatic relations between israel and the soviet union he said

an official newspaper claimed tuesday 
that a french aid workers body was burned in an airport traffic 
accident as it was being driven to a plane for a flight to france 
the report in the alkuwat almusalaha was the first reaction 
from sudans military government to the incident last week 
a french embassy spokesman insisted the body was boobytrapped 
and exploded the parisbased aid organization for which the man 
worked has also made that claim 
the corpse was among those of three frenchmen who died with a 
sudanese colleague when their light plane was shot down dec 21 in

spokesmen denied involvement 
on dec 29 the french aid organization medecins sans frontieres 
said in paris that the frenchmans body exploded at khartoum 
airport agency spokesmen said medical personnel at the scene did 
not believe the explosion was caused by a buildup of natural gases 
and feared the body had been boobytrapped 
on tuesday the government daily alkuwat almusalaha denied 
there was an explosion and said the frenchmans body was burned in 
a traffic accident on the tarmac 
the newspaper said a french embassy pickup truck carrying two of 
the bodies collided with rails on the tarmac a term it did not 
explain after the accident it said friction of the trucks body 
against chemical and plastic materials meant to prevent 
decomposition of the bodies caused the fire 
the newspaper added that french embassy officials participated 
in the investigation and concurred with the findings 
but a spokesman for the french embassy denied that saying 
instead that a dry explosive was placed inside the coffin or was 
attached to it causing the explosion 
he said an ethiopian working as the embassys driver also was 
severely burned and that a sudanese and an eritrean also were 
injured 
southern sudanese rebels have been waging a civil war against 
the government in the north since 1983

a man emerged tuesday from the 
vatican embassy where gen manuel antonio noriega took refuge more 
than a week ago and us soldiers hustled him away a priest 
inside said he was a little fish not noriega 
at least two of the deposed generals top aides are known to 
have sought shelter in the embassy and a panamanian officer said 
many former noriega henchmen were believed to be hiding in the 
vatican or other embassies 
i can assure you none of the big ones left said the rev 
javier villanueva reached by telephone in the embassy he said he 
did not know the name of the man taken out 
reporters and photographers with telephoto lenses posted on the 
roof of a nearby hotel agreed the man did not appear to be noriega 
he came out of the embassy with two others including 
villanueva and was turned over to the american soldiers who 
surround the compound they marched the man to a helicopter which 
took him away 
church sources said the man was a cuban trying to get a visa to 
the united states at the time of the us invasion and fled to the 
embassy fearing for his life the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he was flown to fort clayton headquarters of us 
army south near panama city to be investigated

were believed to have eluded capture by hiding in embassies 
the vatican announced that one of its top experts on latin 
america had arrived in panama to help in the negotiations about 
noriegas fate 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said monsignor giacinto 
berloco would give a hand to the papal nuncio sebastian laboa 
who is the equivalent of an ambassador navarro would not give

the building but also has said it would not hand him over to the 
united states without his consent

vatican will turn noriega over soon but urged patience 
the vatican wants to come up with a solution that will not 
cause trauma to anyone he said the vatican will turn him 
over it has to do it no one would ever consider noriega a 
political refugee 
the government meanwhile closed two television and 10 radio 
stations believed linked to noriega and declared them under state 
custody 
government spokesman edwin cabrera said the stations finances 
would be investigated and their assets expropiated if 
irregularities were found if not he said they would be returned 
to their owners 
we dont intend to turn these mediums into propaganda machines

roadblock about 200 showed up shouting noriega youre trash

state police and the attorney generals office are investigating 
the state is approaching this as a very serious incident

theyre looking at whether it was some sort of narcotics 
terrorism

countyissued lincoln towncar with a mac10 automatic weapon the 
prosecutor was cut on his hands from the shattered glass but did 
not require medical treatment 
the car that i was driving looks like a piece of swiss

declaring im back maynard jackson was inaugurated as 
atlantas mayor for a third term tuesday after an eightyear hiatus 
elsewhere pittsburghs first elected woman mayor sophie 
masloff promised to lower taxes and develop the citys riverfront 
at her inauguration while in houston kathy whitmire took the oath 
of office for a recordtying fifth term as mayor 
among those who attended jacksons inaugural at the atlanta 
civic center were the rev jesse jackson and rep john lewis dga 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown and naacp 
executive director benjamin hooks had been expected but did not 
attend 
im back and i want you to know im fired up turned on and 
im ready to roll starting tomorrow morning jackson said during 
a 30minute inaugural address in which he promised to fight 
homelessness crime and drugs and to invest in downtown atlanta 
as the lord as my witness and my guide were going to move 
atlanta on up to higher ground and were going to do it 
together said jackson who was atlantas first black mayor his 
previous terms ran from 1974 to 1982 
security at jacksons inauguration was tightened in light of 
death threats associated with the recent string of mail bombings 
which federal officials said may have been carried out by a group 
with a grudge against the naacp and the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals 
mrs masloff flanked by her family and colleagues said her 
administration would cooperate with other governments and the 
private sector in competing for new business and conventions 
in everything we do we will be concerning ourselves with 
families saving and creating jobs owning a home and getting a 
mortgage protecting people from crime and drugs caring for our 
older citizens guiding and loving our children she told several 
hundred onlookers packing the lobby of the citycounty building 
mrs masloff said she would meet with gov robert p casey to 
work on a plan to provide property tax relief for the elderly and 
trim the citys 10 percent amusement tax which covers sports 
events concerts and other entertainment 
she also promised to form a riverfront development commission to 
create housing jobs and green space along the allegheny 
monongahela and ohio rivers the former head of the city council 
mrs masloff automatically became mayor following the death of 
richard caliguiri on may 6 1988 she ran unopposed in the november 
general election after defeating four challengers in the democratic 
primary in may 
in houston mrs whitmire was joined by 13 other city council 
members in induction ceremonies at the brown theater she gave no 
hint whether she would accept a 24 percent raise that would boost 
her salary to 130875 
i dont think shes had time to think about it spokesman 
paul mabry said 
mrs whitmire usually accepts a lower amount for her job mabry 
said since she first took office in 1982 she has turned down a 
total of about 125000 in pay he said 
her raise along with a nearly 14 percent hike for city council 
members goes up automatically under a 1977 state law that sets 
salaries of elected city officials at a percentage of the pay of a 
harris county district judge which is 87250 this year 
jackson who enjoyed strong campaign support from neighborhood 
activists has said he will try to kill two controversial road 
projects the presidential parkway from downtown to the druid 
hills neighborhood and the georgia 400 extension from interstate 
285 north of the city through the affluent buckhead neighborhood to 
interstate 85 
his most immediate problem may be money finance officers under 
the outgoing administration of andrew young have called for a 
property tax increase jackson says he doesnt want one 
jackson 51 served the maximum two consecutive terms allowed 
under the city charter and was succeeded by young in 1982 young 
having served two terms is running for governor this year 
during his eight years out of office jackson practiced law but 
remained a popular political figure his chief challenger in the 
october mayors race fulton county commission chairman michael l 
lomax dropped out of the race last summer after polls showed him 
far behind

shipping experts expressed concern tuesday about 
the safety of aging supertankers following a tanker explosion and 
massive oil spill that threatened moroccos coastline 
its certainly true that the world tanker fleet is aging 
said geoff garfield shipping editor of lloyds list the daily 
newspaper for international shipping most companies own ships 
built in the 1970s and a lot of them are now reaching 15 years 
garfield said the accepted life span of a tanker is 15 to 20 
years before extensive renovation or replacement is needed 
there were predictions that supertankers would last 1520 
years but structurally nobody particularly knows said ian white 
of the international tanker owners pollution federation its 
like old jumbo jets we didnt know how long they would last 
the union representing ship masters and officers is concerned 
when ships get long in the tooth it gets us worried said 
derek bond the assistant general secretary of the 20000member 
national union of marine aviation and ship transport officers said 
its a bit like a car we normally prefer it taken out of 
service at 20 years but there is a difference between the way that 
ships are maintained by first class operators who spend money on 
maintenance and others who overwork their ships that should be 
withdrawn from service bond said 
mike squires a spokesman at the international chamber of 
shipping dismissed concerns about supertanker age limits and said 
the debate is stoked by commercial interests wanting to sell new 
vessels 
a ship is not something that has a best by date on it 
squires said referring to the dates stamped on many supermarket 
items 
some supertankers can remain in service much longer than others 
depending on maintenance levels experts agreed 
the khark 5 built in 1975 and acquired by the national iranian 
tanker co in 1986 spilled about 19 million gallons of light crude 
after an explosion tore through its hull on dec 19 in the atlantic 
ocean about 100 miles off morocco 
oil spill expert richard golob said the khark 5s history which 
includes damage in attacks during the eightyear iraniraq war may 
have contributed to its problems 
the vessel was the target of iraqi fighter jets on at least 
three occasions between 198688 said golob who is based in 
cambridge mass 
on feb 7 1988 golob said an iraqi jet dropped a 
1100pound bomb on the vessel setting it on fire and severely 
damaging its center tanks at least two people were injured he 
said 
these incidents may have contributed to the khark 5s current 
problems said golob publisher of golobs oil pollution bulletin 
garfield of lloyds list said the khark 5 was one of the tankers 
that operated night and day on the shuttle service during the 
iraniraq war which ended in an august 1988 ceasefire 
they operated between khark island and sirri island running 
the gantlet of iraqi air attacks and after the war some of them 
were detained in european ports for alleged deficiencies in 
maintenance he said 
garfield said the khark 5 was not one of the detained ships 
several experts said increased costs and lower chartering rates 
are forcing operators to make do with renovation instead of 
replacement a new vessel the size of khark 5 would cost 80 
million to 100 million they said 
shell is spending 28 million to renovate four 15yearold 
tankers 
properly maintained you can make a ship last as long as you 
like said jim mccoy a naval analyst at the international 
institute for strategic studies 
obviously you have to be more careful with an older ship 
mccoy said you wouldnt take a 20yearold motorcar around 
indianapolis 
mccoy rejected comparisons between aging airplanes and 
supertankers 
older airplanes are suffering from fatigue fractures he 
said 
in the aftermath of the exxon valdez spill in alaska the us 
congress is considering legislation which would require tankers 
calling at us ports to have double skins or double bottoms 
similar legislation which would reduce port fees for double 
skinned tankers is being considered in finland 
there is pressure growing around the world to bring in 
legislation to minimize the consequences of this kind of 
incident garfield said 
some experts fear the double skin would be more hazardous in the 
event of a minor collision or grounding because the water in the 
cavity would hamper salvage efforts

america land of town and country city and 
farm is becoming the worlds first suburban nation but as the 
suburbs of the 20th century become the cities of the 21st the life 
that lured people over the city line is changing this first story 
in a threepart series suburbs crisis of growth examines a 
new suburbia that is less a refuge from the city than a 
selfcontained world with joys and woes of its own 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the suburban land rush began four decades ago claire 
worthing was there to stake her claim 
william levitt was planting houses on the old potato fields of 
long island and each day dozens of young couples moved into 
levittown claire and her husband jerry were among them 
we felt like settlers says mrs worthing who remembers a 
lot of mud and six months with no phone service you had a 
frontier feeling 
today she lives in a suburbia no would confuse with a frontier 
a world of highrise office buildings sprawling industrial parks 
and seamless tracts of houses all connected by ever more congested 
highways streets once filled with kids playing ball are now lined 
with cars for working wives for grown children living with 
parents for commuters driving to work in other suburbs 
the spread of suburbanization since world war ii has meant the 
end of suburbia as its pioneers knew it long island the first 
census bureau metropolitan statistical area with no central city 
has itself become a new kind of city a suburban metropolis 
the new city has new problems after an urban crisis in the 
1970s and a rural one in the 80s the nation may face a suburban 
crisis in the 90s a crisis of growth so explosive that it is 
changing the good life that drew americans to suburbia in the first 
place 
nonetheless they keep coming despite the traffic the long 
commutes the cost they are people like joseph pando who after 
several years of living upstairs in his mothers house in queens 
has saved enough to buy a house in levittown 
pando and his wife have a young daughter and are planning 
another child they want more space better schools and above all 
safer streets queens is going down the drain like the rest of 
new york pando says 
attitudes like pandos help explain why suburbanites have 
swelled in number from 35 million in 1950 to about 110 million 
today they comprise nearly half the population urbanites account 
for only a third and six of every 10 metropolitan area residents 
where people have gone business has followed factories and 
department stores moved to industrial parks and shopping malls 
years ago and in this decade office buildings the factories of 
the postindustrial economy are joining them the suburbs claim 
60 percent of all office space and in some metro areas three of 
every four new jobs 
the suburb which once defined itself in terms of the urb 
an escape from but dependent on the city is becoming 
selfsufficient the site of art galleries museums theaters 
concert halls stadiums and french restaurants the suburb says 
university of miami urban geographer peter muller is the essence 
of the modern metropolis 
once the butt of urbanites jokes the suburb now enjoys a 
certain arrogance northpark an officeretail complex north of 
atlanta is a new city of north atlanta a promotional film 
boasts there is no need to leave it is totally 
selfsufficient 
the new suburbia is alternately dense and sprawling extending 
for dozens or scores of miles from the old city center covering a 
circle 10 to 20 times larger than the traditional preworld war ii 
city 
this suburban metropolis embraces skyscraper clusters with more 
office space than old central business districts vast onestory 
manufacturing complexes and new forms of the traditional bedroom 
community some cheekbyjowl with office or industrial parks 
others miles from anything 
we are now in the midst of the most rapid transformation of 
the city in its history says georgia state university geographer 
truman hartshorn for the past 2000 years the city had just one 
center now it has many 
muller the geographer compares the suburban metropolis to a 
large pepperoni pizza with the sausage slices representing the 
highway intersections where malls and office parks cluster what 
used to be the big pepperoni the central city is merely first 
among equals and sometimes not even that 
the deluxe pie is greater los angeles with at least 18 
different centers 
just as cities once sprung up along rivers and rails these 
suburban metropolises grow along highways and beltways originally 
designed for longdistance interstate travel such routes are 
merging the old sovereign cities of baltimore and washington into a 
single metropolitan area the largest marriage of its kind in 
history 
suburbia also is turning up in unlikely places people are 
commuting between new york and the pocono mountains of 
pennsylvania between los angeles and the mojave desert between 
boston and cape cod metropolitan washington is pushing into west 
virginia 
especially in cities the image of suburbia is stuck in the 
50s a husband rides or drives to work in the city each morning 
and returns each night to his wife kids and dog and their a 
singlefamily house and yard 
in reality more than twice as many workers now commute from 
suburb to suburb as from suburb to city and only one in five plies 
the traditional suburbcity path the condominium now rivals the 
onefamily house as the most common new residential unit and the 
nuclear family with one wageearner no longer constitutes a 
majority of households 
suburbia even looks different the towers seen at the beginning 
of the television show dallas are not in the city itself but 
in las colinas a planned suburb 
north of atlanta greg logan looks out his 15th floor window at 
a new american landscape gleaming office buildings surrounded by 
vast parking lots 
this is perimeter center an office park which lent its name to 
an area of office buildings shopping malls and other businesses 
logan tells outoftowners he lives and works in atlanta but 
marta the atlanta rapid transit line does not run here and the 
citys mayor holds no sway here 
there is no mayor logan says theres no perimeter center 
braves but theres more jobs here than raleigh or charlotte 
and more office workers than downtown atlanta perimeter center 
just one of several major business centers outside the city has 
155 million square feet of office space compared to 116 million 
square feet downtown and a lower vacancy rate 
situated near some of greater atlantas most expensive 
residential areas perimeter center is a success many say because 
people who run businesses dont want to spend hours driving to and 
from them 
the typical workplace is no longer an urban factory spewing 
pollution but a suburban office building spewing traffic as 
metropolitan areas expand and traffic worsens the best suburbs to 
live in river oaks in houston dunwoody in north atlanta beverly 
hills are pleasant neighborhoods that also are near business 
centers

logan himself lives about four miles from his perimeter center 
office in a fourbedroom house on a half acre in the quiet 
community of sandy springs when asked about his commute he can 
barely contain his smugness 
ten minutes each way unless theres traffic he allows 
then maybe 15 i never have to get on the freeway 
three thousand miles away sociologist mark gottdiener stands on 
a desert hill looking down at what he calls the beast moreno 
valley calif one of the nations fastest growing communities 
this is the suburban frontier 70 miles east of la ten years 
ago he says there was nothing down there but rattlesnakes 
coyotes and sagebrush today there are 105000 people about 
1000 new ones move in a month and four or five schools open each 
year 
but the principles on which moreno valley was developed are 
wellestablished leapfrog beyond the urban fringe where land is 
cheaper and build 1000 houses rather than 10 that was the 
lesson of levittown says gottdiener you can go anywhere and 
produce an instant city you can plunk it in the middle of 
nowhere 
what you get is the ultimate commuters community since there 
are few good jobs in moreno valley itself but those who can afford 
less than 160000 for a home are drawn here despite the long 
commutes to jobs in los angeles or orange county 
when bill hampson pastor of a local church asks people why 
they dont go to church on sunday the most common answer is 
commuting he says a lot of people drive 100 miles a day and 
the weekend is literally their only free time 
baby sitters advertise commuter hours from 4 am until 7 
pm and there are brisk sales in commuter paraphernalia such as 
books on tape and dashboard coffee mugs 
someday however moreno valley will have its own factories and 
office buildings and already some people are complaining that it 
is becoming too congested already for sale signs are posted 
on farmland in the towns further east past the san andreas fault 
for all their differences suburbs like perimeter center and 
moreno valley share one striking trait an isolation from and 
frequently an antagonism toward their central cities 
for the first time a generation of suburban americans lacks an 
emotional tie to the city a feel for its lifestyle and an 
interest or stake in helping solve its vast problems 
levittown for instance began as an appendage of new york city 
most of its residents came from there had relatives there and 
worked there but today most levittowners work on long island and 
spend almost all their time there to them the city means 
congestion and above all danger despite an increase in suburban 
crime someone in new york city is about eight times more likely to 
be a robbery victim than someone on long island 
the young people now dont really care about the city or even 
go there very often says claire worthing who used to drive into 
the city on weekends for shows at the apollo theater in harlem 
they just go to the malls

my god the suburbs john cheever once 
wrote they encircled the city like enemy territory and we 
thought of them as a loss of privacy a cesspool of conformity and 
a life of indescribable dreariness in some splitlevel village 
cheevers essay moving out described his wrenching 
decision to move his family from a manhattan apartment to a house 
in westchester county in the late 1940s 
four decades later esther renzer is in the same spot 
she and her husband david are preparing to sell their coop 
apartment in brooklyn and move to one of two suburban areas 
northern new jersey if davids career keeps him in new york or 
southern california if it takes him there 
esther knows the suburbs will be cleaner quieter and safer 
especially for her 2yearold daughter sabrina but esther is 
worried 
i feel more alive in the city she says its almost as if 
i breathe differently ive become a city person 
as a businesswoman closet writer and people watcher esther 
finds inspiration in the city as a marketer my finger has to be 
on the pulse of whatever will motivate sales she explains in 
the city youre more aware of that its where trends start 
when cheever moved out he missed the frenchspeaking panhandler 
who used to work beekman place the central park zoo lion house at 
4 pm on february afternoons a bagpiper on the lexington avenue 
subway platform who played a black watch march between trains 
when she moves esther will miss prospect park the brooklyn 
botanic garden the old russian immigrants who sit on benches in 
her neighborhood and cluck over sabrina shell even miss the f 
train 
in the city she says sabrina has been exposed to museums 
restaurants different kinds of people im afraid of raising her 
in too sterile an environment 
that is the suburbs 
that is where esther now on the verge of 30 was once a shy 
unappreciated teenager moving almost represents going back to 
what i was there she says 
some of her reluctance also hinges on what she is afraid may be 
a womans role in the suburban order 
i dont want to live like the stepford wives she says 
referring to a film in which suburban women were like robots i 
dont want to be concerned just about my house and my family and i 
dont want to have to spend all my time driving around i like 
street life 
despite his wifes misgivings and the longer commute to his 
manhattan office david renzer welcomes the move hes tired of 
city noise and pollution and looks forward to relaxing in his own 
house and yard after a hard day and both parents feel life will be 
better for sabrina 
when shes older i couldnt let her out alone in the city to 
ride her bike esther says theres just too many stories 
the renzers considered moving to manhattan or buying a weekend 
house in the country but prices led them to the suburbs you get 
more space for your money esther shrugs 
she can take heart from cheever who became the chronicler of 
suburbia and one of its greatest fans he enjoyed being able to 
shout in anger or joy without having someone pound on the radiator 
for silence and not having to tip a building staff of 20 at 
christmas 
the truth is im crazy about the suburbs he wrote a decade 
after moving out and i dont care who knows it

erma bombeck once defined suburbs as places 
where everyone has the same living standards the same weeds the 
same number of garbage cans the same house plans and the same 
level in the septic tank 
that may have been true of the traditional bedroom suburb but 
as suburbia becomes the dominant theater of american life defining 
it becomes more difficult 
heres what most people probably mean by suburb a community 
beyond the builtup part of the city where most people drive cars 
and live in single family houses with yards 
the traditional suburb was defined by what it excluded 
factories large stores and offices poor people but what we still 
call suburbia has all that plus hospitals theaters museums and 
stadiums 
robert fishman a leading historian of suburbia says the 
separation of work from home was an essential feature of the 
suburb when jobs and people moved en masse to the suburbs he 
argues the history of suburbia ended and a new form of city was 
born 
the modern suburb a place where the affluent chose to live 
emerged in england during the industrial revolution as cities 
became increasingly dirty noisy and crowded 
before that a suburbe was defined as a place of inferior 
debased and especially licentious habits of life in 
shakespeares time suburbanite was an insult 
today suburbs come in all descriptions rich and poor old and 
new large and small 
they include the chicago suburbs of kenilworth where the per 
capita annual income is over 61000 and ford heights where it is 
less than 5000 
san jose calif is a suburban community so large that it has 
suburbs of its own 
orange county which used to be a suburb of los angeles is now 
in the term of sociologist mark baldassare a disurb that is 
a decentralized industrialized selfcontained urban region 
tysons corner va is a complex of shopping malls and office 
buildings with more retail sales than downtown washington and more 
office workers than miami 
tysons corner is divided politically among several state 
legislative districts it has no mayor or council only a 
publicprivate transportation management association to deal with 
the only problem anyone there really cares about traffic 
what do you call tysons corner urban village edge city 
suburban downtown suburban activity center 
everyone who studies them comes up with a new term says 
robert cervero a planning expert at ucalberkeley sometimes 
its unclear if people are talking about the same thing

for 10 years ken bodes beat was 
political corruption and three presidential campaigns as a 
correspondent for nbc news now he is tackling an offcamera role 
training journalists 
at age 50 bode left his highprofile reporting job last august 
to become director of the center for contemporary media at depauw 
university 
he helped break ground in the fall for the 44 million facility 
that will house the private colleges student newspaper radio 
station yearbook magazine and stateoftheart television and 
radio studios 
for bode leaving the rat race of network television was an easy 
decision 
part of the reason i came here is that i want to have every 
dinner with my two daughters and my wife at home which is what i 
missed for the last 10 years traveling for nbc he said 
further he wants to use his contacts to help aspiring 
journalists gain experience and access to journalisms biggest 
names and issues 
while he waits for construction of the media center to be 
completed in the spring of 1991 bode lectures to nonjournalism 
classes catalogues hundreds of his old nbc tapes and stumps for 
support of the center at depauw which is vice president dan 
quayles alma mater 
this is going to be a really exciting place he said this 
is an old school with an old very independent tradition of 
journalism what were going to try to do is give it new life 
bode also plans to maintain his professional ties with 
occasional appearances on nbc and other networks 
one of the things i want to do is use what remains of my 
contacts with the real world of television to be able to give 
students here an opportunity to work in honesttogod realworld 
television 
nbc asked bode to anchor a special on negative commercials used 
in political campaigns 
i said yes if we can do it so i dont have to travel very 
much but i want you to ship all the tape here so well have it 
here we can dub it and begin to build our archive 
one of bodes projects is to use nbc footage to study the final 
week of the 1988 presidential campaign students will base their 
own reports on the footage without seeing what bode and other 
correspondents aired 
well just make them be journalists against a deadline every 
single day i think itll be exciting he said 
bode wants his students to steer away from what he calls the 
handout journalism that he said prevails in todays political 
reporting 
television doesnt do a very good job of covering politics 
anymore maybe we never did i think its gotten worse as the 
presidential campaigns have grown to manipulate not just the 
reporters on the beat but the entire network news coverage teams 
the handout journalism that exists in the white house has now 
gone to campaigns as well its real real important that that 
stop

at a youth club in northwest moscow 8yearold pavlik 
teremetsky sat at an americanmade computer helping three island 
survivors build shelter hunt fish and gather firewood for the 
approaching winter 
later he put his experiences into writing 
i and my friends kirill and misha went on a trip around the 
world he wrote our ship ran aground during a bad storm and 
was destroyed we held on to the remnants of a mast and made it 
ashore very strange creatures live there they look like 
dinosaurs 
his story was sent electronically to a microwave station outside 
the soviet capital for relay via an intelsat satellite to a ground 
station in the united states 
its ultimate destination a small public library in the san 
diego suburb of sona beach calif where a group of american 
children play the same game after school 
the experimental project involving soviet and american 
schoolchildren is one of a series undertaken by us public 
interest groups peace activists educators academic researchers 
and other professionals to try to promote better eastwest 
relations and encourage reforms through the use of personal 
computers 
the activities include daily exchanges of electronic mail 
messages between computers in the two countries over a new 
satellite communications network linking the united states with 
moscow and other major soviet cities 
at the same time however several american experts on soviet 
computer technology say some of the pc enthusiasts may have naively 
overoptimistic expectations they contend that even with more 
personal computers the soviet union is unlikely to develop a 
westernstyle information society 
the united states now leads the soviet union about a hundredfold 
in numbers of personal computers approximately 30 million pcs in 
this country compared to between 200000 and 350000 in the soviet 
union most soviet pcs are installed at schools universities 
research institutes military bases factories and other 
enterprises relatively few are in use at home 
within the soviet union pcs are extremely expensive 
ibmcompatible xt clones sell for about 50000 rubles 80000 at 
the official exchange rate while at clones go for up to 80000 
rubles 130000 
in july the bush administration lifted export controls on the 
sale of ibmcompatible at and similar desktop computers to the 
soviet union after finding that such pcs were readily available in 
11 countries including hungary and czechoslovakia 
the decision was sharply criticized by secretary of defense dick 
cheney who contended that it would provide to moscow computers 
with military applications and thus give the soviets 
significant capabilities they do not now possess 
rep george e brown jr dcalif a senior member of the house 
committee on science space and technology said he was in favor of 
lifting the export controls and moderately optimistic about the 
longerterm implications of increased numbers of personal computers 
in the soviet union 
it will contribute to the spread of democracy in the soviet 
union mainly because a growing number of what you might call the 
computer literate or computer elite people will have access to a 
broad base of information about whats going on in the rest of the 
world he said 
brown said that will allow them to make better judgments about 
the changes political and otherwise that will be necessary in the 
soviet union and theyll be better prepared to act to accomplish 
some of these changes 
direct highspeed communication between computers in the united 
states and soviet union has been facilitated by the establishment 
early last year of the san franciscomoscow teleport which uses 
data channels relayed by an intelsat satellite 
joel schatz the american entrepreneur who heads the teleport 
and soviet officials signed an agreement sept 20 formally creating 
a joint venture between the san francisco company and the 
moscowbased research institute of applied automated systems 
schatz said that after more than four years of work we have 
solved the major technical and political problems for providing 
electronic mail service 
he noted that when we first attempted to connect a computer 
modem to the moscow telephone network several years ago we needed 
approval from the ministry of communications and half a dozen 
additional moscow agencies today we simply use alligator clips to 
connect modems to phone wires without any permission 
schatz attributed the change mainly to the increased familiarity 
of soviet officials and technical personnel with electronic mail 
systems earlier he said this was a new technology for them 
they had never seen email before 
a few computer hobbyists have begun exchanging messages via the 
teleport but most of its users are companies and other 
organizations among them 
stanford universitys linear accelerator center in palo alto 
calif which has been exchanging information with the institute of 
nuclear science at novosibirsk in western siberia 
david leith a highenergy physicist at the stanford center 
said the electronic link has substantially aided communications 
with soviet colleagues about joint scientific work 
he noted that our prior communications were by mail which is 
long and unreliable by phone which is difficult and by telex 
which is expensive 
the space studies institute in princeton nj which has been 
using the teleport to discuss possible joint space missions with 
the moscow aviation institute 
international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war a 
public interest group based in cambridge mass which used the 
teleport to communicate with its soviet counterpart about travel 
plans and other logistics in advance of a world conference held in 
hiroshima japan 
argus trading ltd a small company based in rockville md 
whose business includes export to the soviet union of oil pipeline 
equipment chemicals and machinery for producing electronic circuit 
boards

<TEXT>
theres a potential for it to be a great moneysaver said 
thomas anaya us contract manager for argus about the electronic 
mail link if you use telexes as much as we do you find that the 
savings can be tremendous 
americans wanting to use the san franciscomoscow teleport first 
must get a written agreement with a counterpart in the soviet union 
for an electronic mail connection this paperwork can take up to 
five weeks to be completed 
the teleport charges a onetime setup fee of 100 commercial 
users pay a monthly service fee of 200 while nonprofit groups 
are charged 25 to 75 per month in addition there is an online 
connect charge of 15 per hour 
the networks staff offers both englishtorussian and 
russiantoenglish translation services at a minimum fee of 30 
per message and volume charges of up to 35 cents per word 
the ussoviet teleport is closely tied with peacenet a san 
franciscobased computer network linking nearly 2000 subscribers 
from dozens of peace groups in the united states and other western 
countries 
michael shuman executive director of the center for innovative 
diplomacy in irvine calif a group instrumental in forming 
peacenet said he was very interested in ways in which promotion 
of computer technology can strengthen glasnost and perestroika 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policies of openness and 
restructuring 
it may turn out that the real significance of computerization 
is to inoculate the soviet union from a dramatic reversal of 
glasnost shuman said the more that computers and information 
are spread the more difficult it will become for the government to 
suddenly rewrite history or pull that information back from 
people 
communication via the san franciscomoscow teleport also is at 
the heart of the ussoviet educational effort being led by 
michael cole a russianspeaking psychology professor at the 
university of californiasan diego and alexandra belyaeva of the 
soviet institute of psychology in moscow 
cole said island survivors was among computer games being 
used because everybodys interested in global consciousness of 
ecology he said this activity had developed into a very lively 
discussion where the kids brought in a lot of knowledge beyond the 
specific game 
in the eastwest education project he said each side usually 
sends messages in its own language with bilingual teachers on hand 
to translate at the other end 
the program conducted after school so that it does not 
interfere with the regular curriculum involves several dozen 
children ages 6 to 12 in each country 
test sites in the united states include the childrens school in 
la jolla calif a day care center associated with the erikson 
institute of early education in chicago casita maria an 
afterschool center in new york citys east harlem and a center in 
new orleans associated with the university of new orleans the 
solana beach library was used for two years up through last summer 
cole said that although he was pleased by progress achieved in 
the program so far there are enormous institutional and cultural 
barriers to really making it anything more than a public relations 
gimmick 
i like it as public relations its not bad but in general 
even within the united states when you have the use of electronic 
mail to amplify educational activity its much more promise than 
delivery he said 
other american observers voice mixed feelings about the role of 
personal computers in improving eastwest ties and promoting 
reforms within soviet society 
gary chapman executive director of computer professionals for 
social responsibility a public interest group based in palo alto 
calif spent three weeks in the soviet union last spring to get a 
firsthand look at soviet computing 
after returning home chapman launched a drive to raise 35000 
for personal computers and other office equipment to assist 
perspektiva a moscow cooperative affiliated with community groups 
that offer social services dealing with problems such as domestic 
violence afghan war veterans youth crime and drug abuse 
perspektiva operates a clearinghouse of information none of it 
yet computerized collected from more than 1200 nongovernmental 
organizations across the soviet union 
chapman said he doesnt have particularly high expectations 
about the value of computer technology for enhancing eastwest 
communication however he believes pcs can play a significant role 
in aiding the work of progressive organizations such as perspektiva 
im a little bit concerned that a lot of the financial and 
philanthropic support for computerization with respect to the 
soviet union is mainly focused on this eastwest communication 
business and not on supporting indigenous efforts that from my 
perspective would have a lot more impact chapman said 
accompanying chapman on the trip was esther dyson the 
russianspeaking editor and publisher of release 10 a new 
yorkbased computer industry newsletter 
ms dyson said she concluded afterward that its not enough 
its like having your eyes open but your muscles arent connected 
until you have the economic vitality that comes from really 
liberating the forces of individual business all this stuff isnt 
going to do enough 
richard judy director of the center for soviet and east 
european studies at the hudson institute in indianapolis said he 
estimates there are currently about 350000 personal computers in 
the soviet union with that number increasing by about 100000 a 
year including both soviet production and imported machines 
however judy said that even with a growing number of pcs their 
impact within soviet society is likely to be limited partly 
because of inadequacies of the countrys telephone system for 
carrying computer data 
to really have a ripple effect that all of us would like to 
see fanning out horizontally across the population is going to 
require much better telecommunications thats just not likely to 
be in place anytime soon judy said 
seymour e goodman an expert on soviet computer technology at 
the university of arizona said that in the years ahead what 
emerges will no more resemble a westernstyle information society 
than gorbachevs emerging sovietstyle democracy will resemble 
westernstyle democracy 
the most likely changes over the next several years range from 
modest increases in technology applications narrowly related to 
achieving the states main goals to the attainment of some more 
ambitious vision of enlightened collectivism that has yet to be 
defined by soviet academics or technocrats he said 
goodman added that even if the ussr undergoes social and 
economic reforms as radical as those of hungary a scenario that 
is not inconceivable information technology will still be more 
tightly controlled and less pervasive than in the west

to sell their products food companies often 
play to americans concern or obsession about what they eat 
but many health experts worry that the no cholesterol drumbeat 
can go beyond clever marketing and flirt with outright deception 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
consider the cholesterolfree banana 
since the beginning of time this fruit has never contained 
cholesterol unless evolution takes an unexpected turn it never 
will 
recently however some banana importers pasted cholesterol 
free labels on their produce the stickers seem to imply that 
this is a new banana a better banana a healthier banana 
but in truth its just a banana 
why point out the biological truth that bananas like every 
other fruit and vegetable under the sun dont have cholesterol 
perhaps for the same reason that makers of vegetable oil margarine 
buy tv ads that say no cholesterol at all 
to sell their products food companies play to americans 
concern or obsession about what they eat but many health 
experts worry that the no cholesterol drumbeat can go beyond 
clever marketing and flirt with outright deception 
everyone knows cholesterol is bad for the heart so if a food 
doesnt have any cholesterol it must be ok right 
wrong 
people can say something doesnt contain any cholesterol but 
it can still be a product that raises your cholesterol 
substantially thats the problem said dr carl orringer of the 
university of michigan 
high levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream can clog up the 
arteries and lead to heart attacks orringer and others believe the 
nocholesterol pitch takes advantage of public confusion over the 
difference between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood 
contrary to popular belief cholesterol in food has a relatively 
minor impact on cholesterol in the blood the part of food that 
really raises blood cholesterol is saturated fat being cholesterol 
free however is no guarantee that something is also low in 
saturated fat 
the saturated fat level in nocholesterol foods depends largely 
on the type and amount of vegetable oil that goes into them these 
oils contain widely varying combinations of saturated 
monosaturated and polyunsaturated fats they range from canola oil 
which is 6 percent saturated fat to palm oil which is 51 percent 
saturated fat and coconut oil which is 92 percent saturated fat 
lots of foods are cholesterol free in fact only animals foods 
such as meat and eggs contain cholesterol anything made entirely 
from plants does not indeed cannot have cholesterol 
many people are obviously confused about all of this a recent 
us food and drug administration survey found 42 percent of the 
american public believes that if a food is labeled cholesterol 
free it is also low in saturated fat 
despite its relative unimportance the no cholesterol claim 
sings out from every aisle of the supermarket popcorn bread 
crackers salad dressing and salted peanuts often carry it 
labels like that are misleading and frequently dishonest 
contends dr john larosa of george washington university they 
beg the real issue which is this is a food that can raise your 
blood cholesterol 
dietary experts say the key to prudent eating is holding 
down consumption of fat all fat its implicated in some kinds of 
cancer its far more fattening that sugar and starch and some 
component of it is always saturated 
in fact some of the most diligent nocholesterol labeling is on 
highfat baked goods 
for instance duncan hines cake mixes boast no preservatives 
no palm oil no cholesterol the fine print on the back however 
discloses that once a devils food cake is baked 47 percent of its 
calories come from fat

<TEXT>
at procter amp gamble co which makes the cake mixes spokesman 
don tassone said thousands of consumers have called asking about 
those three things the label is a point of differentiation for 
our product line and a healthful service for people who are 
interested 
procter amp gambles crisco shortening also is labeled no 
cholesterol even though it contains palm oil and is 26 percent 
saturated fat tassone said crisco is clearly a healthy alternative 
to its primary competitors lard butter and beef tallow which 
all contain cholesterol and much higher proportions of saturated 
fat 
because of recent bad publicity over palm oil crisco will soon 
switch to hydrogenated cotton seed oil but it will still be 26 
percent saturated fat 
bakeries are getting in on the nocholesterol hoopla for 
instance the mrs fields cookie chain recently began selling 
cholesterolfree chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies 
martha shepherd mrs fields vice president of research and 
development said the new cookies are made with margarine and egg 
whites instead of butter and whole eggs but she declined to 
reveal their fat content or any other nutritional information 
they could potentially have some benefit from a heart disease 
standpoint but we are not making a direct health claim shepherd 
said 
some disagree with her assertion however posters advertising 
the chains nocholesterol cookies proclaim eat to your hearts 
content 
thats a health claim and its misleading said dr william 
e connor of oregon health sciences university even cookie 
fanciers and im one of them know that all cookies are high 
fat you arent going to help your heart by eating a mrs fields 
cookie 
bakeries are not required to put nutritional information on 
their bags labeling for packaged foods is also voluntary unless 
manufacturers fortify their products with vitamins minerals or 
protein or they say something about the foods value 
cholesterol content must be included only if some claim is made 
about it however packages that boast of no cholesterol neednt 
mention saturated fat 
the american heart association and other health organizations 
generally recommend that people limit their fat consumption to 30 
percent of their total daily calories no more than 10 percent of 
the days calories should come from saturated fat 
since its next to impossible for ordinary people to figure out 
the percentage of fat and other nutrients in their own diets many 
health experts recommend putting this information on food labels 
connor urges use of the cholesterolsaturated fat index or csi 
to make comparisons between foods even easier this index uses a 
mathematical equation to arrive at a single number for each food 
the higher the number the greater the foods potential to cause 
heart disease 
for instance the csi for half a cup of baked beans is zero so 
is a cup of apple cider an unbuttered english muffin an ounce of 
jelly beans a cup of rice and 1 cups of spaghetti with marinara 
sauce 
a cup of sherbet is 3 half a can of sardines is 4 half a cup 
of mixed nuts is 6 3 ounces of dark meat chicken with skin is 7 3 
ounces of hamburger is 11 a slice of frosted carrot cake is 14 3 
ounces of calves liver is 16 3 ounces of cheddar cheese is 24 two 
scrambled eggs are 27 a half cup of butter is 71 
the banana like most fruits and vegetables earns a healthy 
zero on this index so why dwell on the impossibility of it having 
cholesterol paul yoder a spokesman for dole the fruit company 
said the nocholesterol stickers were part of a banana industry 
campaign to improve the fruits image 
because bananas are smooth and buttery he said some people 
actually think they contain butter and are fattening which at 90 
calories apiece they are not very while the stickers might seem 
to imply that less desirable fruits are full of cholesterol or that 
these particular bananas are somehow better than competing brands 
yoder said the stickers were meant to clear up public confusion 
when cholesterol is considered not good for you and you dont 
have it then i see no problem in saying you can eat this and not 
worry about getting too much cholesterol he said 
however larosa has another view of all the nocholesterol 
labeling 
its just silliness he said i hope the public catches 
onto it

finding the middle ground on government policies 
on which the washington establishment can take a stand is what a 
small washington think tank the foreign policy institute has 
taken as its lifework 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it could be called the search for common 
ground for the government policies that people of good will vast 
experience solid reputations and firmly fixed opinions can embrace 
without swallowing pride or principle 
or it could be put this way can hawkish jim schlesinger and 
dovish cyrus vance agree on anything 
and how would you like to be simon serfaty the cigarsmoking 
professor whose job it is to bring the schlesingers and the vances 
under the same tent 
finding middle ground on which the washington establishment can 
take a stand is what a small washington think tank the foreign 
policy institute has taken as its lifework 
it wants to tell the world that even in contentious times wise 
gray heads in washington can achieve consensus 
the process is almost as interesting as the product it involves 
months of negotiating by mail and phone to frame a statement of a 
few thousand words on which a dozen or so washington heavyweights 
can sign off the issues might be policy toward china after 
tiananmen or how much say congress should have in foreign policy 
the product is called a policy consensus report three or 
four of them issue forth each year from the institute an offshoot 
of john hopkins universitys school of advanced international 
studies 
as might be expected these documents tend to be sensible 
stolid and undramatic 
once hammered out the reports are sent to 2000 to 2500 people 
of influence members of congress and the executive branch 
business leaders academics news people 
even in this city with too much to read theyve begun to earn 
respect although sometimes as in the case of a report on 
ussoviet relations this summer events move so swiftly the 
recommendations can quickly become dated 
im very impressed says rep lee hamilton dind chairman 
of the housesenate joint economic committee these reports come 
from people who are genuinely interested in the national interest 
this is the idea if washingtons policymakers know that former 
top officials hawk and dove liberal and conservative free 
marketeer and social tinkerer alike have agreed on a point they 
know where they can go without finding themselves on a limb 
they know where lies consensus they know what the establishment 
thinks 
or so thinks harold brown whose idea this was and who is as 
establishmentarianistic as they come 
a nuclear physicist and former president of the california 
institute of technology he served as lyndon johnsons secretary of 
the air force and jimmy carters secretary of defense and with 
richard nixon and gerald fords delegates to disarmament talks in 
helsinki vienna and geneva 
leaving government brown noted that each new administration 
tended to dissociate itself from the positions of its predecessor 
polarization on each controversy whether the issue be 
transitory or continuing trivial or profound makes it even more 
difficult to deal with the serious and longlasting problems facing 
the country he said 
the result he said was that america spoke with such a 
constantly changing voice that other nations tended to regard this 
country as an irresponsible and unreliable player in world 
political military and economic affairs

so brown set out to prove that there is more agreement in 
washington than might meet the eye 
he formed a core group with four other exgovernment leaders 
melvin laird secretary of defense under nixon schlesinger who 
held that post under both nixon and ford vance secretary of state 
under carter and brent scowcroft national security adviser to 
ford and now to president bush scowcroft bowed out after getting 
the bush appointment each is a respected player on the verge of 
elder statesmanship 
then for specific issues brown brings in other experienced old 
hands chiefly former cabinet members 
then begins the process of getting them to agree on a bottom 
line statement on some foreign policy issue 
the task of reconciling various views falls largely on serfaty 
a frenchborn scholar who teaches at hopkins and runs the 
institutes daytoday affairs 
after an issue is chosen serfaty drafts a working memo and a 
series of recommendations he tests it for reasonableness with 
fellow academicians then brown sends the memo and recommendations 
to the core group and a dozen or so former officials soliciting 
their participation comments and ultimate agreement 
some write extensive revisions some phone in their misgivings 
some quibble with a word or two some sign on without a change 
sometimes a few finding themselves in fundamental disagreement 
with the rest withdraw from the process 
serfaty accumulates the reactions revises the statement trying 
to accommodate new views without antagonizing other partners but 
also without compromising to the point that the result is a paper 
so rounded as to be meaningless 
in the mail goes draft no 2 participants can accept it or drop 
out 
sometimes a suggestion is made which if accepted would mean 
the direction the trend the focus the spirit of the document is 
distorted says serfaty then harold negotiates engaging in a 
kind of bargaining we are the intermediaries harold of course 
has enormous credibility with these people and that helps too 
no dissents no footnotes are permitted at the end a 
participant must be willing to support the recommendations in their 
entirety 
serfaty says the participants are never brought together a 
joint meeting might invite exercises in hairsplitting 
on the other hand he finds that former government officials 
accustomed to keeping their eye on the main point are less likely 
to quibble over nuances than would be his fellow professors 
i could not get this kind of statement from 12 of my 
colleagues he says occasionally a word becomes a source of 
debate but usually nobody is exceedingly picky a couple of truly 
heavyweights have accepted the statement exactly as it came to 
them 
the experts in reports issued so far have agreed on such 
points as these 
fiscal policy after every attempt to cut government 
expenditures has been made revenue increases may well be 
essential a defiance of bushs read my lips rhetoric that 
to serfatys delight william simon as conservative as they come 
on economics was willing to endorse 
china further sanctions at this time even if effective are 
more likely to weaken the position of reformist groups in china and 
to hurt the general population than to force a quick reversal of 
policy by present leaders support for bushs cautious policy at 
a time liberals were calling for a firmer stand 
nato there must be no denuclearization of europe 
removal of tensions between white house and congress 
presidents should give greater weight to congressional experience 
in considering candidates for important positions in the executive 
branch 
none of the proposals is particularly revolutionary thats the 
point they wouldnt be consensus if they were

even after exit permits are issued and paperwork 
is completed soviet emigres to israel often have to wait for 
transportation six to eight months and with a new law in the 
works the situation may get worse 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when efem starovinsky finally wrested an exit 
permit from soviet officials after a 10year struggle he thought 
his emigration problems were over then he tried to buy an airline 
ticket 
starovinsky is one of the thousands of soviet jews discovering 
that while president mikhail s gorbachev has chipped away at 
political barriers to emigration bureaucratic and logistical 
hassles remain in fact those problems are getting worse as more 
people flood an underdeveloped transportation and currency exchange 
system designed for only a trickle of travelers 
according to israeli sources more than 51000 jews were allowed 
to emigrate in the first 10 months of 1989 matching the height of 
the previous tide of emigration in 1979 
starovinsky a 40yearold father of two from lithuania has 
been waiting daily in the cold and snow outside the moscow offices 
of the hungarian airline malev along with dozens of other jews to 
get tickets to fly to budapest and from there to israel 
we waited for many years for the hour when we could arrive in 
israel starovinsky and his group said in an appeal to the 
israeli government and emigre activist natan sharansky who heads 
an israeli emigre aid organization and now when we have passed 
through a large part of the journey we have wound up in a 
desperate situation 
he says airline officials say no spaces are available and only 
accept two or three names daily on a waiting list malev officials 
could not be reached for comment 
soviet officials refused for 10 years to give starovinsky an 
exit permit because his parents wouldnt give their consent he 
finally received the permit in september and has been trying since 
to get a ticket out in the interim becoming a man without a 
country 
wouldbe emigres have given up their apartments jobs and soviet 
citizenship before descending on moscow from throughout the country 
to try to obtain airline tickets to budapest or bucharest romania 
the only two transit points from which israel will accept them 
soviet jews heading for the united states and other destinations 
about 87 percent of the total according to israeli sources 
face similar logistical troubles 
some of those who want to go to the united states are stuck in a 
limbo caused by tighter us limits imposed on emigration the new 
rules give priority to soviets with relatives already in the united 
states and officials have indicated 200000 people might be turned 
down in the current year 
israeli officials are hoping to lure 300000 soviet immigrants 
over the next three years with a program providing housing jobs 
and air fare to israel from budapest or bucharest 
but they feel powerless to help with the soviet transportation 
problem 
aryeh levin the head of an israeli consular delegation in 
moscow said the transportation problem is the biggest his 
diplomats face in trying to get jews out even after exit permits 
are issued and israeli paperwork is completed the wait for 
transportation averages six to eight months he said 
the israelis are hoping to cut the wait with direct air flights 
between moscow and tel aviv but officials of israels el al 
airlines say negotiations with the staterun soviet airline 
aeroflot have stalled over flight prices no startup date has been 
announced 
space on soviet and foreign airplanes is at a premium because 
the number of soviets traveling or emigrating as well as the 
number of foreign tourists and businessmen traveling to the soviet 
union has skyrocketed 
for soviet jews traveling to israel planes are the only option 
because israeli officials fearful they might suddenly choose 
another country will not accept them if they leave by train 
its practically impossible to buy a plane or train ticket 
the weekly newspaper literaturnaya gazeta complained in a recent 
article that reported widespread corruption among sales clerks who 
it said are accepting bribes of at least 200 rubles 324 for 
tickets 
the problem is likely to get worse if the soviet legislature 
adopts a law lifting most emigration and travel restrictions under 
current law emigration is granted only for family reunification 
and travel is by invitation only both of these restrictions are to 
be lifted under a law the legislature preliminarily approved nov 
13 
if the bill is given final approval soviet officials predict 
the number of citizens traveling abroad will jump from 2 million in 
1989 to as much as 7 million in 1990 the number of emigres is 
projected to jump from 200000 to 600000 
but the logistical problems like the shortage of spaces on 
planes the heavy workload of visa officials immigration 
restrictions imposed by other countries and limits on the amount of 
money soviets can convert into foreign currency could hinder the 
flow 
literaturnaya gazeta said the soviet union could be accused of 
not keeping its promise to open its doors unless transportation and 
currency exchange problems are solved 
without corresponding practical provisions it the new law 
could turn into just a declaration not adding anything to real 
human rights the newspaper said 
with the wait as long as it is now efem starovinsky says he 
cant imagine what it will be like when the law produces a real 
exodus

he once played trombone for duke ellington 
traveling with the band from chicago to london birdland to 
broadway but he exchanged the bandstand for the pulpit of an 
innercity parish in connecticut 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you cant really blame the organist at st 
marys for chasing after monsignor john sanders to get up there in 
the choir loft with his valve trombone 
if the monsignor could lift the congregation the way those cats 
were lifted out of their chairs and into the aisles stomping and 
screaming at 2 am in that unforgettable climax to the 1956 
newport jazz festival there would be no need for a sermon and 
hardly anybody would be ducking out before the second collection 
a couple of decades ago when the big band era was in its final 
full cry john sanders held down the middle chair in duke 
ellingtons trombone section 
birdland the blue note in chicago bostons storyville and ritz 
carlton roof carnegie hall the savoy ballroom and the apollo 
theater up in harlem the paramount and loews state on broadway 
londons royal festival hall 
john sanders was up there on the bandstand in white tie and 
tails sending out sensuous solos and melding joy and sighs into 
melodic arrangements of mood indigo i got it bad and that 
aint good take the a train im beginning to see the 
light dont mean a thing if you aint got that swing i 
let a song go out of my heart and other ellington classics 
but coming out of salt lake city one night the reading light 
came on over the right front row seat in the band bus that meant 
duke had an inspiration and was composing again 
then the reading light came on over the seat just behind john 
sanders who served as ellingtons copyist on the road was 
beginning to see the light a different light he was absorbed in 
pamphlets about delayed vocations to the roman catholic priesthood 
i was past 30 and really thought it was too late but the idea 
was always on my mind says this son of a new york harlem postal 
clerk so i dropped in for a chat with a priest in salt lake 
city he urged me to look into what i was going to do with the rest 
of my life 
sanders also received encouragement from the rev norman 
oconnor a paulist priest who had a radio jazz show in boston and 
was master of ceremonies at that newport jazz festival when the 
ellington band made the police nervous by igniting the crowd to a 
dancing frenzy with a scorching rendition of diminuendo in blue 
it seems like only yesterday the world was john sanders 
bandstand hollywood london paris rome vienna but now he does 
his solo turns from the pulpit and confessional of an innercity 
parish in norwalk a decaying factory town trying to make a 
comeback as a historic seaport 
soul has a deeper meaning for this dedicated man with a horn who 
at the christmas midnight mass retreated into the past from his 
usual pastoral duties to lift his trombone toward the altar for a 
triumphant rendition of once in royal davids city 
do i miss the old days he ponders the question he sometimes 
asks himself on his knees in his nightly examination of conscience 
yes i really do but not in the sense of longing to go back i 
treasure those memories duke made dreams come true of everything i 
wanted to do or be as a musician 
those memories began with a sixthgrader at st marks parochial 
school in harlem investing 25 cents of the dollar he got for his 
11th birthday in a balcony seat at the apollo theater on new yorks 
125th street 
i was always an ellington fan before during and after 
confesses the monsignor who still rummages through record stores 
and garage sales for additions to his collection of duke albums 
sanders took the atrain to the high school of commerce where 
lincoln center now stands he played trombone in the school band 
which won him assignment to those fine navy bands at great lakes 
and san diego at the close of world war ii 
he studied composition and arranging under the gi bill at new 
yorks juilliard school and began doing gigs with lucky 
thompsons orchestra at the savoy ballroom and some club dates with 
mercer ellington dukes son who had his own group 
one night duke needed a substitute trombonist and mercer 
recommended me it was like a dream come true sanders recalls in 
his tiny rectory office his eyes flickering like high altar 
candles i always thought he was beyond my reach and never met 
him until i went backstage at the apollo he loaned me a jacket 
handed me some music and told me id be ok 
they were closing that night with pearl bailey i played the 
second show duke suggested i come out on the road with them for a 
few nights he didnt say where we were going or for how long we 
went to the south and out through texas four months went by we 
wound up in san diego and i didnt get home until april

memories warmed that rectory cubicle more than the afternoon sun 
faintly filtering through the lace curtains going to hollywood to 
record dukes sound track for anatomy of a murder playing 
lyndon johnsons white house and carnegie hall with ella 
fitzgerald crossing the atlantic on the ile de france to do a 
command performance for the queen and that other duke the duke of 
edinburgh 
jazz then was americas most popular export and ellingtons 
recordings led all continental charts the europeans took our 
music very seriously they knew everyone in the band he says 
ill never forget the royal festival hall as each of us came on 
stage they applauded us like players coming on the field at the 
super bowl 
duke and his valve trombonist came home on the queen mary a few 
weeks later sanders had a confession to make he told ellington he 
was leaving the band to find himself 
an incident during rehearsals at the blue note in chicago eased 
some of the pain duke called me over to the piano and played 
something serene and meditative i told him it was beautiful it 
was an accompaniment to the our father he was writing for a 
sacred concert with mahalia jackson 
i never talked religion with duke and wasnt conscious he 
belonged to any particular denomination but his whole way of doing 
things and how he dealt with us musicians showed a respect and 
warmth for the individual that i think is very spiritual 
god was treated reverently on the bandstand too duke was 
very generous with requests but there was one he would always 
bypass if someone requested as they usually did when the saints 
go marchin in he wouldnt touch it he felt that with all the 
other music available why risk making fun of what his mother 
taught him as a hymn 
ellington hated to lose a fine trombonist and even rarer an 
expert copyist he was very fatherly about my decision says 
sanders his voice still throbbing with the ache of their parting 
he kept saying do what you got to do and make it work for you 
 
he was ordained on feb 10 1973 by bishop walter curtis of 
bridgeport duke couldnt get to the ordination he was off doing 
onenighters 
but the next day when the new priest celebrated his first mass 
at st pius v church in the jamaica section of new york city where 
his family had moved lo and behold there was duke sitting in 
the front pew and my it was wonderful to see him 
a year later duke was dead and sanders was among the mourners 
at new yorks st john the divine cathedral listening to ella 
fitzgerald sing his haunting solitude 
sanders doesnt think the motivation for his priestly duties of 
celebrating mass performing baptisms and marriages hearing 
confessions burying the dead visiting hospitals and homes 
counseling youth and senior citizens is all that far removed from 
the music world 
band experience helped a lot with the discipline needed in a 
priestly life as a musician i had to practice and be on my toes 
every night no matter how well you did the night before this is a 
new theater a new ballroom every audience has its own chemistry 
in the priesthood no matter how many times you preached and 
said mass before you hope youre not just repeating words theres 
a challenge to bring a message of hope through scriptures not just 
something routine like at a concert you begin at the beginning 
and imagine youre doing it and the congregation is hearing it for 
the first time 
when his priestly day is done the monsignor likes to put 
something on the record player and relax in the past most often 
an ellington classic 
i dont use earphones but i keep it down real quiet so as 
not to wake up the whole house other priests live here and in 
this business you get up real early about the time we used to be 
going to bed

statistics are the ammunition gus miller uses in 
his war against smoking and while the fight is far from over he 
feels hes won a few battles already 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he doesnt sport antismoking badges or 
constantly spout smokeandcroak warnings like his more militant 
comrades nonetheless gus miller is relentless in his campaign to 
snuff out what he considers americas no 1 drug cigarettes 
his is a solitary relatively quiet war his ammunition is 
statistics 
im a scientist im also a pragmatist and to me the best 
way to do it is to just chip away miller says 
the 65yearold statistician has been poking into americas 
penchant to puff since 1972 when he launched studies on smoking a 
nonprofit research group from his edinboro home in northwestern 
pennsylvania 
last summer miller quit his job as a math and computer science 
professor at edinboro university to devote all his time to seek out 
the perils of tobacco 
why is this so important to me because cigarettes are 
responsible for 400000 premature deaths a year he says ive 
seen so many of my family or my friends die needlessly because they 
smoked 
he manages he says to push personal feelings aside 
yeah its an emotional issue says miller an ardent 
nonsmoker who despises cigarette smoke but i teach stopsmoking 
clinics so you have to use psychology you cant get emotional 
about it 
more than 50 million americans smoke cigarettes according to a 
1989 report by then surgeon general c everett koop an additional 
40 million would be smoking if not for changes in an increasingly 
health conscious environment the report contends 
millers efforts to publicize his message have been thwarted at 
times he says because of who he is or rather who he isnt 
if youre not a member of the club and youre not an md 
and you want to get into medical journals youve got problems 
says miller who has a doctorate in educational psychology 
the club he explains is the people who get all the grant 
money and publish thats the club 
donald shopland public health adviser for the national cancer 
institutes smoking tobacco and cancer program acknowledges most 
published data on smoking is financed through federal grants 
except for occasional small donations from industry miller 
finances his own research he figures hes spent 60000 to 70000 
over the years 
they are a fairly rare bunch who are doing their own 
individual research with their own individual funds shopland 
says 
despite such obstacles miller has had several dozen articles 
published in professional periodicals he signs his work as gh 
miller 
miller also has presented his findings at scientific conferences 
around the world including a symposium on cancer prevention in 
france last april there he reported an eighttonine times 
greater risk of cancer among nonsmoking women who live with 
smokers than those in smokefree homes he based his conclusion on 
a study of 906 nonsmoking women from surrounding erie county who 
died from 1975 to 1980 
in late october and early november miller attended the fifth 
general chautauqua conference on ussoviet relations at the 
university of pittsburgh he spent the week urging soviet medical 
officials to adopt more stringent nosmoking measures 
dr yuri lopukhin director of the research institute for 
physiochemical medicine in moscow and an expert on addiction was 
impressed with millers work and would like him to visit the soviet 
union to share his views 
although antitobacco education has been offered in soviet 
schools the past five to 10 years and stopsmoking programs are 
available for adults the efforts have not made much of a dent in 
the countrys large smoking population lopukhin said 
i think he miller is yes helpful he is very active 
lopukhin says but he maybe does not succeed so much in this very 
heavy problem in your country and our country too

the tobacco institute a trade association representing us 
cigarette manufacturers has criticized miller for being 
nonscientific in his collection and analysis of data 
and of course you get that from your fellow scientists who 
say no your data is invalid because it varies from what they 
have found miller says you see my problem is im always on 
the forefront 
lawrence garfinkel vice president of epidemiology and 
statistics for the american cancer society is among those 
researchers skeptical of millers work on secondhand smoke 
some people dont agree with the methods he uses garfinkel 
says he may have done some of the early work on passive 
smoking i can tell you when they cite the studies that have been 
done they dont include his very often 
the surgeon generals 1989 report concludes that secondhand 
smoke can cause lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers in addition 
children of parents who smoke have an increased frequency of 
respiratory infections 
more than one of every six deaths in the united states is due to 
cigarette smoking according to the surgeon general smoking is 
responsible for an estimated 30 percent of all cancer deaths 
including 87 percent of lung cancer deaths 21 percent of deaths 
from heart disease and 18 percent of stroke deaths 
cigarettes are much more deadly much much more deadly than 
narcotics miller says theyre much more addictive 
thats why we try to push for getting laws strengthened and 
churn out research articles showing how bad active smoking is and 
how bad passive smoking is 
like many americans miller was unaware of all the risks when he 
decided in 1972 to take on smoking he was prompted into action 
after talking to a nurse about the varying lifespans of men and 
women 
i mentioned to her that to me it was pretty obvious smoking 
has something to do with the malefemale longevity difference and 
the reason i knew that is my father was a heavy smoker he got 
emphysema he tried to quit several times and he got wiped out 
he says 
she said well wheres your data so i figured well let 
me go chase around and look for data 
miller began sorting through erie county death notices in 1972 
in his spare time noting those people who were at least 30 when 
they died by the following year he was interviewing survivors to 
see whether the dead had smoked 
he found after analyzing the lifestyles of about 500 people that 
men and women lived to about the same age if they did not smoke 
there was a difference of 16 years though between smoking and 
nonsmoking women and a 12year gap between smoking and nonsmoking 
men the journal of breathing published his findings in 1975 
i knew there was more there he says i started going 
fullblast 
in 1976 after compiling data on 3500 more subjects with the 
help of volunteers miller issued a second report showing similar 
longevity results 
miller ventured into the controversial area of secondhand smoke 
in the late 1970s and since has devoted most of his time to it 
in a particularly controversial study published in 1984 he 
reported a significantly higher risk of cancer among unemployed 
women whose husbands smoked compared to those whose husbands did 
not he based his conclusions on 842 erie county residents who died 
in 1975 and 1976 
the tobacco institute still is fuming over that report 
we assume anything he attempts to publish anything he 
presents to a conference will follow along the same lines of his 
previous research says walker merryman the institutes vice 
president 
undaunted miller now is trying to determine whether there is a 
link between secondhand smoke and breast cancer he also is in the 
midst of expanding the study he presented in france 
when miller is not collecting data hes busy trying to get 
smokers to quit about 150 people have paid up to 200 to attend 
his sos stopsmoking clinic part of his studies on smoking nearly 
half are cigarettefree after one year according to miller 
miller whose only brush with cigarettes was as a youth says 
the clinics have made him more tolerant of smokers than some might 
suspect 
i dont go out with my sword in hand and lop off heads of 
people who smoke he says i feel sorry for them because i know 
its a very bad habit and i know they probably want to quit and 
they cant

richard chamberlains hawaiibased medical 
series is undergoing cosmetic surgery to make it more attractive to 
the audience 
in the near future his character of dr daniel kulani in 
island son will spend more time away from the hospital and 
become more involved with people the cbs show also has new opening 
credits and new music that went into effect when island son 
moved from tuesday to thursday in middecember 
when we go back into production after the first of the year 
well open up the show and spend more time out of the hospital 
says chamberlain youll see those changes around february 
chamberlain says this will take island son closer to its 
original concept of a man who was educated in modern medicine yet 
still honors the hawaii traditions and folk medicine of his 
upbringing 
these are things weve been asking for for a long time he 
says the drop in the ratings seems to support me now everyone 
has the same idea the interesting thing to me as an actor is the 
human side not the medical drama i think people have seen enough 
faulty gall bladders and hematomas 
even doctors have a life outside the hospital which may come 
as a surprise to some people ill be involved in closer 
relationships with the residents and some surprising things will 
happen in my life my exwife is going to come back and cause me 
some severe emotional difficulties 
besides family and human relations the show will have fast cars 
and martial arts 
chamberlain is no stranger to hospitals of course his first 
and only other series dr kildare was one of televisions 
earliest and most successful medical dramas 
since that series in 196166 chamberlain made a name for 
himself as a classical actor in england starred on broadway made 
a number of feature films and became the king of television 
miniseries 
he was interviewed during a visit to the mainland while island 
son was temporarily out of production even before starting the 
series he had moved to hawaii 
ive always wanted a house by the sea everything i looked at 
in malibu was impossible you cant get into malibu for less than 
3 million i found this place in hawaii its beautiful and off 
the beaten track after doing a miniseries it was a place for me to 
go and recuperate its very healing and soothing 
the actor says hes been traveling consistently for 25 years and 
wouldnt have missed a second of it but he adds 
i wanted to put down some roots i wanted to stop living out 
of a suitcase besides staying put another reason i wanted to do a 
series was that i wanted to be involved on the production side im 
coexecutive producer of island son that makes the job even more 
interesting for me 
the miniseries chamberlain has done have taken him all over the 
world centennial landed him in colorado shogun in japan 
wallenberg a heros story and the bourne identity in 
europe and dream west in the american west the thorn 
birds an australian story was the only one chamberlain made in 
california 
two films king solomons mines and quartermain and the 
lost city of gold took him to africa for many months recently 
he went back to spain where he had done the three musketeers 
and the four musketeers for return of the musketeers he 
plays aramis 
chamberlains hawaiibased show had been in development for a 
long time there were extensive delays in finding a suitable 
writer nigel and carol evan mckeand who had done family were 
signed as executive producers only five weeks before production 
began chamberlain would like it much better if the writing and 
production staff would move to hawaii but he knows that will never 
happen 
its difficult to grasp the feeling of the islands if youve 
never lived there he says our original idea was somewhat 
different from whats been seen so far we were going to have more 
of hawaii itself in it and more of its healing arts kulani is a 
man who was adopted by a traditional hawaiian family and raised in 
this culture 
i think the first script stressed that too much and lorimar 
television and cbs got anxious so were bringing that back we 
didnt intend to be so confined to the hospital were opening that 
up

glynis johns is a perfectionist about acting 
precise analytical and opinionated about a profession she has 
worked at all her life 
that quest for perfection can be seen in the current broadway 
revival of the circle w somerset maughams nearly 70yearold 
romantic comedy about love marriage and fidelity which also stars 
rex harrison and stewart granger 
johns plays lady kitty a fading beauty who years ago left her 
husband granger and young son and ran off with lord porteous 
harrison now the wayward couple has returned and lady kitty 
watches as her daughterinlaw elizabeth prepares to leave with 
another man history is about to repeat itself 
in the plays most touching scene the seemingly frivolous lady 
kitty counsels the young woman about sacrificing her life for a 
love that may not last the tragedy of love is not separation or 
death she says the tragedy of love is indifference 
their encounter is the high spot of the play a touching moment 
in what until then has been a light 1920s drawing room comedy 
lady kitty is one of the most difficult challenging parts 
ive had to play if you want to play it manyfaceted says 
johns 
which of course she does anything else would be giving less 
than her all 
as far as im concerned im not interested in playing the 
role on only one level she says the whole point of 
firstclass acting is to make a reality of it to be real and i 
have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real 
ive never seen anyone play this part in the way im playing 
it and i didnt realize at the beginning which way i was going to 
go but it grew and it grew and its evolved 
the challenge she says was to come in and out of what she 
calls the characters flaky billie burke surface kind of 
comedy and a moment later show kittys real depth 
in real life we act according to the cue we can appear 
irritable and slightly unpleasant or we can appear terribly 
goodnatured and flaky and frothy and rather lacking in depth 
or we can when it is demanded of us go into a depth of 
wisdom and compassion that is an allrounded person i expect that 
there are people who dont have all those sides but there are many 
people who do and i think that kitty is one who does 
johns always has been part of the theater shes the fourth 
generation of an english theatrical family her father mervyn 
johns had a long career as a character actor her mother was a 
pianist and now the actress son is also in the profession 
johns was a dancer at 12 an actress at 14 in londons west end 
there were countless stage appearances and scores of movies in 
england and hollywood ranging from mary poppins to the 
chapman report to the sundowners 
johns is the only member of the circle company to have 
worked before with maugham she did a film called encore based 
on one of his short stories the actress met the famous writer in 
the south of france at vichy where he always took the waters for a 
liver problem 
the place was like a morgue she recalls some of the 
people were quite gloomy and oddlooking i was quite young and 
bright at the time i said to him this must be very depressing 
for you coming here every year and he answered oh thats 
nothing compared to the old ladies who come down in their 
wheelchairs with their pekingese dogs they force the jaws of the 
dogs open and pour the vichy water into them they dont take it 
themselves 
the thought of that made him laugh she said 
the circle is johns first broadway appearance since 1973 
the last time she graced a new york stage was as the worldweary 
desiree armfeldt in stephen sondheims a little night music 
the musical had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and 
score unfinished including a solo song for johns the actress had 
specific thoughts about how her character should be portrayed 
director hal prince suggested she and costar len cariou improvise 
a scene or two to give book writer hugh wheeler some ideas 
hal said why dont you just say what you feel she 
recalls when len and i did that hal got on the phone to steve 
sondheim and said i think youd better get in a cab and get round 
here and watch what theyre doing because you are going to get the 
idea for glynis solo 
in one night sondheim wrote send in the clowns possibly 
the bestknown sondheim song of all time it also was a perfect 
marriage of performer and material 
ive had other songs written for me but nothing like that 
johns says its the greatest gift ive ever been given in the 
theater 
until the circle the actress had never worked with harrison 
although they had met years ago and had a lot of mutual friends he 
was the reason she did the play 
rex is wonderfully innately talented and its a gift that 
god gives you she says you dont learn what hes got 
is she fussy now about the roles she chooses 
it depends on how wellstocked my bank balance is she says 
ive retired many times my personal life has come before my 
work the theater is just part of my life it probably uses my 
highest sense of intelligence so therefore i have to come back to 
it to realize that ive got the talent im not as good doing 
anything else

pink cadillac warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg13 
 
the usually stoneyfaced clint eastwood who gives onenote 
performances with snarling grace is a master of disguises and 
voices in buddy van horns pink cadillac and hes as funny as 
dirty harry is mean 
thats the good news 
the bad news is that pink cadillac treads on old ground and 
never really takes off 
written by john eskow whose only other film credits are two 
shorts for tvs saturday night live the 
adventurecomedyromance follows the antics of tommy nowak 
eastwood an easygoing but resourceful guy who hunts down 
bailjumpers and brings em back alive i find you fetch you and 
federal express you he tells his latest target lou ann mcguinn 
bernadette peters bringing back lou ann whos charged with 
possessing conterfeit money has a few problems first of all the 
money belongs to her excon husband roy timothy carhart and his 
mangey white supremacist friends who belong to a violent armed and 
angry group known as the birthright second the group has 
laundered the phoney stuff for real greenbacks and stuffed about 
250000 worth of bills in the back of roys pink cadillac 
convertible in which lou ann has absconded 
things are further complicated when the birthright snatches lou 
anns baby and offers to swap the tiny tyke for the loot alex 
michael des barres the leader of the group which wants to keep 
america pure for white protestant americans also plans to kill 
the female who has given them so much trouble in the meantime 
tommy violates his own ethics and the ethics of the 
skiptracing trade by falling in love with lou ann 
despite injections of violence and some tired car chases the 
mood is mellow and understated and there is infinite comic relief 
from eastwood and peters eastwoods something for nothing hustles 
are a riot watch for the casino scene in which he dons a gold lame 
tux greases his hair until it gleams like patent leather and 
appends a mustache 
but the direction of van horn who also did the dead pool 
and any which way you can is often labored and the pacing is 
slowed to a crawl eskows dialogue is trite and uninspired 
pink cadillac had a tepid showing theatrically on the home 
screen though its just as interesting as any other tv fare 
however if the theme of hunter forging a close relationship 
with huntee and ultimately switching the game intrigues you go to 
your video store and pick up midnight run starring robert de 
niro and charles grodin or the black and white classic it 
happened one night starring clark gable and claudette colbert

has led some critics to conclude that the beatles influence on 
popular music has petered out after more than two decades 
yet albums such as 11 by the smithereens show there are 
still practitioners of the melodic three minute poprock song and 
they dont have to sound like anachronisms 
11 stands with tom pettys full moon fever as the best 
pure pop rock album of 1989 in contrast to pettys laconic wit 
and sprightly songs the smithereens music is denser and darker 
in fact if the word blue were suddenly banned smithereens 
writer and singer pat dinizio would be strapped but although 
blues before and after and blue period are two of the first 
three songs on 11 dinizio shifts moods more effectively than 
in the past 
a girl like you is radiofriendly with jim babjaks 
metallic guitar reassuring those who worry the smithereens may not 
be tough enough 
the exceptionally pretty blue period features gary sutyaks 
cello and backing vocals by belinda carlisle when you think that 
you have won then your heartbreaks just begun dinizio sings 
in two lines that neatly encapsulate his romantic philosophy 
baby be good which musically quotes i only want to be 
with you and william wilson are the only two weak cuts of 10 
on this album 
and with maria elena and kiss your tears away the 
ending is strong and unusually upbeat the former is a musical 
tribute to buddy holly and a lyrical tribute to the love that 
endures with his widow the latter is an exotic lullaby with a 
sitarlike guitar sound 
with 11 the smithereens have rebounded forcefully from a 
mediocre followup to their promising fulllength debut 
especially for you

concierto de aranjuez fantasia para un gentilhombre by joaquin 
rodrigo granada asturias sevilla majorca cordoba by isaac 
albeniz cbs john williams guitar philharmonia orchestra 
louis fremaux conductor 
 
this disc of guitar music is unevenly interpreted but unified by 
superb sound williams guitar is immediate and clear and the 
orchestra rich in tone what is disappointing is their presentation 
of the concierto de aranjuez perhaps the quintessential spanish 
guitar piece 
the orchestra sounds stodgy and fremauxs accompaniment is 
runofthemill williams playing though technically excellent 
sometimes sounds routine maybe its because he has recorded this 
piece at least four times his performance lacks rhythmic snap and 
the necessary jauntiness of a dandy strolling down a spanish 
boulevard nor does fremaux really dig into the romantic passages 
of the second movement 
this is heartonthesleeve music played with hands in the 
pockets 
things are better in the more intimate but less guitaristic 
fantasia one hears more of williams individual notes and each 
seems to have a life existing within williams is such a fine 
musician that at times the listener loses the sense of a guitar 
line and just hears a melody 
what makes this disc worth acquiring however are the albeniz 
pieces free solos evoking different spanish cities each one is a 
gem williams plays completely unselfconsciously he zeroes right 
in on the mood of each piece and maintains it these are personal 
performances that speak directly to the listener

amid the flurry of academy award hopefuls 
this year two actors have been hailed as certain nominees jessica 
tandy and morgan freeman 
they are a diverse pair both in their driving miss daisy 
roles and in their own lives 
tandy 80 is a product of the london stage a threetime tony 
winner who created the role of blanche dubois in a streetcar 
named desire freeman 52 born in the south and raised in 
chicago is a lateblooming actor who first attracted wide notice 
with his oscarnominated pimp in street smart 
in driving miss daisy tandy is a cantankerous jewish lady 
who is trying to cope with her advancing years and the myriad 
changes in the south following world war ii freeman plays hoke a 
crafty survivor of a lifetime of subservience who learns over the 
years to deal with miss daisys temper in her 90s she tells hoke 
youre the best friend ive had 
both performers were recently in los angeles to help publicize 
the film and their reactions to the oscar talk was expectable 
wouldnt that be nice remarked tandy it would be 
wonderful but i think its too early to count those chickens 
the oscars are a great honor a great honor but i wish they 
ended with the nominations instead of making us adversaries when 
they pick the nominations it means theyve picked the best of the 
crop its a pity they have to single them out as one winner and 
four losers 
for a film the oscar is a financial shot in the arm no doubt 
about it commented freeman for an actor its a tremendous 
career advancement or it could very well be an albatross one 
never knows 
his nomination two years ago was a welcome pat on the back 
but i cant say it was the reason i got suchandsuch a part i 
might have gotten that part because they saw me perform and said 
hey this guy is good i rather think that is what happened 
freeman originated the role of hoke offbroadway and won an obie 
for it tandy saw the play twice but never thought about playing 
miss daisy in the film i didnt even know if it would be a 
film but she was delighted when the producers richard and lili 
fini zanuck asked her to join the cast she appears on the screen 
throughout 
i like big roles i like to be there all the time she 
laughed i wanted to be as good as i possibly could but i didnt 
think it was out of my range 
in terms of energy and appearance tandy seems a few decades 
less than her real age she was asked how she managed to play an 
old lady 
i am an old lady she insisted im not as old as that 
lady but i can imagine what its going to be as i get stiffer and 
weaker ive observed it in other people 
freeman who spent his early years in greenwood miss had no 
problem understanding hoke 
this character was totally realized on paper he said 
playwright and screen writer alfred uhry had dotted all the is 
and crossed all the ts there was little for me to do but slip 
into it and do it 
having grown up in the south i knew this man he was a real 
finely drawn composite of a lot of people i dont think of him 
in terms of being subservient you live in a certain society and 
that society has rules and you abide by them you can always do 
that with a certain amount of dignity 
jessica tandy was born in london and made her stage debut in 
1927 with the manderson girls she first appeared in new york 
in 1930 and for 10 years she shuttled between broadway and londons 
west end a 20th centuryfox contract brought her to hollywood and 
in 1942 she married an mgm actor canadianborn hume cronyn 
in 1946 she had the role of a lifetime as tennessee williams 
doomed heroine in a streetcar named desire she won the tony 
but she was missing from the cast of the movie 
i didnt expect it and i understood perfectly she 
remarked i would have loved to do the movie but elia kazan was 
able to keep his whole cast together with the exception of me it 
was warner bros that wanted to have a movie star vivien leigh 
so you pick yourself up and go on to the next thing 
she went on to a busy career costarring with cronyn in plays 
the fourposter the gin game films cocoon 
batteries not included and television foxfire 
morgan freeman was slower to establish himself as an actor but 
seems to be making up for it in later life after air force 
service he studied drama and dance played everything from 
hello dolly to coriolanus in new york his career flowered 
with street smart this year he has appeared in a staggering 
four films lean on me johnny dangerously driving miss 
daisy glory 
does he wish that success had come sooner 
there is a tendency to wish things had happened earlier but 
theres always the danger that happening earlier would not be in 
your best interests he said its safe to assume that the 
world is unfolding as it should

the two women are dressed in black they speak 
with passion and gravity they argue about art and sexism 
they wear gorilla masks 
they are the guerrilla girls selfproclaimed conscience of 
the art world and in their crusade to end discrimination against 
female and minority artists these artists will quote statistics 
and cite examples but they wont reveal their identities 
instead they wage guerrilla girl warfare they have 
surreptitiously plastered walls with blackandwhite broadsides 
since 1985 
bus companies are more enlightened than nyc art galleries 
reads one poster which compares the percentage of women who are 
bus drivers 492 percent and managers 43 percent to the number 
of women represented at the citys 33 major art galleries 16 
percent 
how many women had oneperson exhibitions at nyc museums last 
year asked another poster in 1986 answer one at the museum of 
modern art and none at the solomon r guggenheim museum 
metropolitan museum of art or the whitney museum of american art 
a similar group mothers of medusa they wear medusa masks has 
postered los angeles crashed the opening of the museum of 
contemporary art and distributed plastic snakes with messages 
attached about the lack of visibility of women artists there also 
have been guerrilla actions in chicago and texas 
but the guerrilla girls stress theyre not an organization as 
much as a state of mind theres no national structure or even a 
local organizational structure 
what galleries show no more than 10 percent women artists what 
male artists allow their work to be shown in those galleries what 
art critics write about women artists less than 20 percent of the 
time the guerrilla girls name names 
they may wear masks they may go to outrageous lengths to 
maintain their anonymity arranging that an interview take place in 
a large basement painted entirely in black at a converted 
warehouse in lower manhattan but the guerrilla girls are very 
serious 
the art world which is supposed to be such an enlightened 
liberated situation is in fact worse than corporate america said 
girl no 1 dressed in a black turtleneck khaki shorts and a 
fiercelooking mask with fangs 
we dont want this generation thats right now to be lost so 
that 100 years from now feminists have to be digging up who was 
doing art now said girl no 2 clad entirely in black with a 
somewhat tamer mask 
the group was born in 1985 after the museum of modern art 
mounted a grandscale survey of international art and less than 10 
percent of the artists included were women 
they worked under cover of darkness concealed by a cloak of 
anonymity to avoid retribution from galleries and museums and to 
allow the message to stand alone unclouded by personalities 
gallery owners dont agree with them and dont like them the 
museum of modern art would not comment on them and the met did not 
return calls made by the associated press 
most of the guerrilla girls are visual artists although they 
say some sympathetic women in positions of power in museums and 
other institutions also belong the two women interviewed both 
artists themselves wont say how large the group is 
they put out about a halfdozen posters a year and have 
sponsored exhibitions panel discussions and lectures at which 
sexist audience members are likely to be pelted with bananas from 
the stage they are distinctly low budget most of their money 
comes from small donations although they received grants for two 
art shows 
their campaign shows signs of success more women are getting 
into galleries and major museums have held a few shows of female 
and minority artists including the guggenheim which now is 
showing the works of jenny holzer the standard college text hw 
jansons the history of art has been revised to include women 
but detractors such as gallery owner mary boone say the girls 
are climbing up the wrong tree three of the eight americans she 
represents are women 
the whole art world is highly competitive and 
discriminatory she said but its discriminatory based on 
talent not on gender the issue is not men versus women the 
issue is really success versus failure 
yet even critics concede that women historically were 
discouraged from expressing themselves as artists just as they 
were kept out of most pursuits except housework and parenting art 
critics and historians were generally men and the women who did 
manage to produce art were often ignored 
the lead character of the pulitzer prizewinning play the 
heidi chronicles is a feminist art historian who tries to rectify 
those centuries of neglect author wendy wasserstein applied some 
guerrilla tactics herself incorporating into the play slides and 
lectures about women artists through the ages such as clara 
peeters and lily martin spencer 
now wherever the play is staged wasserstein said theyre 
going to have to show slides of works by women forever 
but major hurdles remain the most significant being money art 
is a field in which success increasingly is judged in terms of 
dollars 
the disparity in terms of the economics is unbelievable 
said girl no 1 according to the us census women artists earn a 
third of what their male counterparts make 
the highest price for any painting by a living man was 1705 
million the winning bid last year for jasper johns false 
start that is more than 81 times the record price for a 
contemporary painting by a woman 209000 for three trees by 
susan rothenberg and nearly four times the record price for any 
painting by a woman 451 million for mary cassatts the 
conversation 
art dealers say prices for art are not based on gender but 
rather on a hierarchy that places artists such as picasso and van 
gogh on one level johns and andy warhol at another and so on the 
price is based on supply and demand the accessibility and the 
desirability of the work and the artists audience boone said 
very few command multimilliondollar prices 
susan dunne a contemporary art specialist at christies auction 
house said the prices fetched by female artists such as joan 
mitchell and holzer are rising 
the girls hope to accelerate that trend through cagey 
manipulation of the auction system 
it doesnt happen accidentally that particular male artists 
have hit particular auction prices said girl no 2 the high 
prices usually follow museum shows or other publicitygenerating 
events that heighten interest in the artist 
so what were saying is ok its not only the white guys who 
can play this game she said we can set things up push for 
certain women who might be able to break certain auction prices or 
certain black artists who we think can break auction barriers 
the girls will continue putting out the posters and plan a 
billboard for lower manhattan they also are considering a 
sexdiscrimination lawsuit against one or more of the big new york 
museums all get some federal funds they note 
the bottom line is women artists are there and artists of 
color are there said girl no 2

in rock n roll theres the beatles expert 
the kind of guy who plays sgt peppers lonely hearts club band 
backwards looking for hidden messages 
theres also the dylanologist who will pick through garbage if 
necessary to find the meaning of the masters music and dont 
forget the springsteen fanatic proudly singing along throughout 
the boss fourhour concerts 
but what about warren zevon fans call them excitable boys 
who must still be scratching their heads over werewolves of 
london and roland the headless thompson gunner just what did 
he mean by i saw lon chaney walking with the queen or 
accidentally like a martyr 
zevon doesnt know himself 
search through his garbage and youll find egg shells milk 
cartons and a shopping bag from the local video store play his 
records backward and youll wind up with nice big scratches sing 
lawyers guns and money in public and youll likely be dragged 
away 
im always saying the lyrics im the happiest with are the 
ones i can explain least said zevon whose new album is called 
transverse city 
when i hear a lot of meanings read into them i dont object 
because there must have been a lot of stuff bubbling subconsciously 
to come out so quick and seem magical i dont think its an 
important enough job in the world where god is sending me lightning 
bolts and im just his vessel its a little lofty 
so dont think that zevons gone political just because he sings 
about perestroika and afghanistan on turbulence he lets his 
friend jackson browne take care of issues 
zevons view of the world is as even as his deadpan style of 
speaking he sees himself as just another song and dance man who 
doesnt get upset by the evening news 
im not a big sides taker i wonder why the bad guy did it 
its hard for me to see good and bad guys i think when you do it 
it enables you to be passionate and thats fun its also 
productive 
im interested in the lyrics themselves which is frankly 
something ive been called to task for in europe where everything 
is so political so borderoriented when i explain its about how 
the words go very well together it doesnt go over very well 
he was once idealistic even napoleonic dreaming of the 
unification of rock songs and modern classical music blame it on 
60s superstars such as the beatles and the rolling stones those 
groups made it seem simple to zevon make great music and people 
will buy your records 
blame bob dylan too 
certainly dylan is the biggest the alltime influence for 
me said zevon born in canada in 1947 and raised in arizona and 
california i heard him and thought thats the job he 
invented it he writes them and he sings them 
he was the undisputed impossible to comprehend master of 
that form he was like an astonishing folk guy it was awesome 
seeing a guy with a guitar and a harmonica was really really 
amazing 
so zevon left his symphony unfinished and played rock n roll 
with some help from browne who got him a deal with asylum records 
zevon released his selftitled debut album in 1976 a time when 
browne the eagles linda ronstadt and others had struck gold in 
california 
but zevon was different his comedy a little too dark for those 
sunny skies his rock n roll too tough critics admired him 
ronstadt covered poor poor pitiful me and others and eagles 
don henley glenn frey and joe walsh appeared on his albums but 
only a handful of listeners could be bothered with gleeful songs of 
murder floods and hairyheaded gents 
i always like to have violent lryics and violent music the 
knowledge of death and fear of death informs my existence its a 
safe kind of cheerful way of dealing with that issue he said 
after his 1982 album the envoy zevon didnt release 
another record for five years the shop closed down for a while 
is how he remembers that period of his life now signed with virgin 
records zevon finds that fame is still something to be written 
about not experienced 
so splendid isolation with its attacks on putting tinfoil 
up on the windows is no poke at himself when zevon cites 
recluses such as michael jackson and georgia okeeffe he does it 
from a distance like a street kid tossing pebbles against 
someones window 
i can certainly go to the market i can certainly go get 
cheeseburgers occasionally i meet somebody who says arent you 
i saw you at what are you doing here i tell them 
im buying a cheeseburger its nothing that keeps me from going to 
get one 
i remember periods of my life when we didnt have tv like 
this we relied on other people he said thats what you did 
you saw other people from the time you woke up and went to bed 
now everybody has a walkman plugged into their ears

one of margaret drabbles trademarks is her 
narrator who makes asides to the reader this technique can be 
considered either astonishingly quaint or strictly postmodern 
alix bowen drives north to harley bridge the narrator 
tells us in drabbles 11th novel a natural curiosity viking 
1995 
as it is a rural route avoiding the great industrial 
conurbations that straddle the middle of upper england she is not 
here provoked into much political thought about the nature of the 
north and how britain votes and you may be spared her occasional 
reflections on these themes for this is not a political novel and 
anyway her reflections are repetitive and do not seem to be getting 
her anywhere very fast 
drabble said the technique was both a modern device and a 
victorian throwback 
its a selfaware narrator a selfreflexive narrator the 
address to the reader is in my view the product of the rise of 
english studies in the universities that there are readers at 
least as trained as the writer the author said in a recent 
telephone conversation from her home in hampstead a london suburb 
but i do think that in both the victorian period and now its 
the completely natural thing to do i think that i am addressing 
not dear reader like charlotte bronte im partly addressing 
dear postgraduate student she said 
and like the victorian novels drabble loves a natural 
curiosity is crowded with characters 
i know that some people have found this book overcrowded i 
dont mind that i quite like overcrowded books myself she said 
she is asked how she keeps so many characters straight when she 
is writing for example does she have to stop and think if shirley 
harper knows susan enderby to name two minor characters in the 
book 
yes i do i do i get quite lost in it but i think she does 
herself drabble said im sure we all have cousins that were 
not quite sure of their relationship and we think oh that must 
have been uncle michaels second wifes daughter i think thats 
the texture of life really you get muddled up 
i would say im antiminimalist i dont like very empty 
books some peoples books have been getting emptier i quite like 
them to be full and that indeed is a victorian thing 
a natural curiosity brings back alix bowen liz headleand 
and other characters introduced in drabbles last novel the 
radiant way the year is 1987 and the tale divides its time 
between shabby northam an economically depressed city in the 
north and london prosperous symbol of privatized england under 
margaret thatcher 
as the title indicates curiosity is much at issue here alix 
has taken to visiting a mass murderer in prison out of a curiosity 
she cant explain liz a psychotherapist who specializes in the 
problems of adopted children is more curious about other peoples 
pasts than her own the rest of the characters husbands and 
exhusbands children and stepchildren siblings and 
halfsiblings lawyers lovers and losers also suffer from 
curiosity variously labled natural morbid and fatal 
i think curiosity is good for you drabble said i suppose 
the title is also asking is curiosity natural or can it be morbid 
i dont know the answer and the book is partly about that 
drabble is considered one of englands foremost contemporary 
novelists although she was relatively unknown on this side of the 
atlantic until her sixth novel the needles eye despite 
literary acclaim she cannot entirely escape the womens writer 
label assigned to her more than a quartercentury ago 
i dont write for women only but i recognize the fact that a 
majority of my readers are women but then i think the majority of 
readers of serious fiction are female i wouldnt like it to be 
thought that i wrote only about womens topics but i think i 
probably do write from a womans point of view she said 
drabble was born in yorkshire in northern england in 1939 she 
graduated from cambridge with honors and married the actor clive 
swift when he joined the royal shakespeare company at stratford on 
avon she went with him appearing in minor roles before abandoning 
acting for writing they divorced after 15 years and three 
children and in 1982 drabble wed writer michael holroyd the 
esteemed biographer of george bernard shaw and others 
in addition to her novels drabble edited the fifth edition of 
the oxford companion to english literature and has written a 
number of short stories plays and critical pieces 
a natural curiosity is very much a chronicle of the times 
characters discuss kidnappings in the middle east worry about aids 
after sexual escapades buy raspberry vinegar and operate fax 
machines 
asked if she fears her book will seem dated in the future the 
author responded i dont worry about the future i think if it 
does become dated it will become dated as a sort of pickled 
curiosity of what time was like then im just interested in 
catching all these things before they vanish 
i think we live in a world of immensely quick social change 
one of the techniques of the book in narrative terms i mean it 
jumps about a lot with a lot of crosscutting quick sequences 
one of the things im trying to catch is the speed with which we 
are fed information 
drabble is now working on a third novel in the series started by 
the radiant way and a natural curiosity it will focus on 
the adventures of stephen cox a character off in cambodia who is 
referred to but never seen in the latest novel

tennessee ernie ford occasionally refers 
to himself these days as a gray haired brokendown bass singer 
the 70yearold ford best known for his tv variety shows in the 
1950s and 60s and his millionselling record sixteen tons 
sure draws a crowd for someone broken down 
some of the top names in show business recently gathered in 
burbank calif for a tv special commemorating his 50 years in 
show business they included dinah shore george gobel della 
reese the everly brothers george lindsey and minnie pearl andy 
griffith and roy clark taped messages for the 60minute program 
which will be aired in february on cable tvs nashville network 
i had no idea who would be there ford said it was a 
marvelous surprise and one great big beautiful party this ol boy 
was really surprised 
ford known affectionately as the ol peapicker and ol 
ern was host of a nighttime tv variety show on nbc from 1956 to 
1961 he had another program from 1962 to 1965 this one on abctv 
in the daytime he believes he came across to tv audiences as a 
loving member of the family 
they felt like when the time came for my show they didnt 
have to change clothes or put sterling on the table he said in a 
telephone interview from his home near san francisco 
they felt comfortable with me i met families at state fairs 
and they seemed comfortable around me and gave me a warm feeling 
theyd say i feel like i know you it was the greatest 
compliment you could get 
at last count he said sixteen tons has sold 20 million 
copies worldwide after becoming a sensation in 1955 it was a 
tribute to blue collar workers especially coal miners with such 
lines as i owe my soul to the company store 
every artist dreams of a song like this ford said a few 
days before heading for southern mississippi and a quail hunting 
trip its an everlasting hit you cover the gamut of the 
audience with it or with something like white christmas or 
stardust 
its still a must on my act even though it was done in 1955 
it seems that young marrieds and even high school kids know it it 
caught on to every working man in the world i guess 
he did a concert tour of the soviet union in 1974 and recalled 
that soviets were aware of the song they didnt know me but they 
knew the song and recognized my voice when i did it on stage 
ford said 
he is especially known for his religious repertoire and it 
became traditional for him to end each show with a spiritual 
number he has sold more than 24 million gospel music albums with 
some still advertised on tv today 
its great music he said it fits so well if done right 
its happy music and people enjoy it you do it because its good 
music and good writing and it lends itself to solos choral work 
and great orchestration 
ford a crewman on heavy bombers during world war ii said it 
was exciting breaking into television in the mid1950s when most of 
the country was getting acquainted with the relatively new 
household fixture 
i was so enthralled getting to go into peoples homes i was 
comfortable in their homes and they were with me i felt warm 
getting into the medium when it was live and black and white 
watching it progress has been a great thrill it was like flying 
those big old planes in world war ii and then coming into the jet 
age 
these days ford does a handful of concerts a year sings at a 
few state fairs does a little recording and some television 
specials his wife of almost 50 years died recently and he has 
remarried 
he said he watches television a lot especially dramas and john 
wayne movies and he wishes there were more variety shows like his 
a generation ago 
tv puts out some good things but not as much as it used to 
the budget rears its ugly head he said we dont have too many 
people directing and producing who know a lot about it 
ford born ernest jennings ford in bristol tenn said he 
wouldnt mind having a fat part in a tv movie or a picture just 
to see what happens this gray haired brokendown bass singer 
wouldnt turn down something like that

italian stockbrokers on tuesday suspended 
trading of shares for 20 minutes to protest the nations slow pace 
in modernizing the securities business 
the protest delayed stock exchange operations on italys largest 
market in milan and in minor markets in rome and turin it did not 
prevent regular listing of closing prices 
italian stockbrokers who have a monopoly on executing 
transactions want parliament to move faster on a number of bills 
regarding public tender offers insider trading and antitrust 
regulations 
trading volume of italian markets is one of the lowest in europe 
and stockbrokers claim this is the result of insufficient numbers 
of listed companies and antiquated operations which they say 
actually hurts competition and fails to attract foreign investors

two top officials of the united airlines flight 
attendants union have turned over the reins of control to new 
leaders after five years of bitter struggle with ual management 
weve been under siege since 1985 said carol holmes the 
locals outgoing vice president 
when she and local president pat friend left their posts monday 
the association of flight attendants remained deadlocked in 
contract talks with united and facing a possible strike ms friend 
blamed differences within the unions executive council for the 
inability to reach an agreement 
its like walking away from unfinished business she said in 
a recent interview 
she and ms holmes announced in december their decisions to 
leave their posts six months before their terms expire 
im not sure i could ever deliver a contract ms friend 
said the situation calls for new leadership and a fresh 
perspective some catalyst needs to come in and alter the 
situation 
united is pressing the union for concessions its leaders say are 
not warranted or needed by a company as strong and profitable as 
parent ual corp 
and the ual buyout plan originally proposed by united 
airlines members of the air line pilots association as a takeover 
defense and later embraced by ual management is viewed by the 
flight attendants as a management ploy to extract givebacks so far 
withheld by the unions 
the original 675 billion 300ashare pilotmanagement bid 
collapsed in october for lack of financing and has been supplanted 
with a 240ashare 543 billion offer 
new york investment group coniston partners has proposed to back 
a recapitalization of ual if there is no deal by jan 8 
ms friend wants all three united unions the 13000member 
afa the 7000member alpa and the 25000member international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers to collaborate on 
a revised proposal rather than allow management to dictate terms 
that require employee concessions for financing 
there are common interests among the unions and its time to 
find out what they are she said 
ms friend said a lull in the buyout furor should give her 
successor diane robertson a chance to get settled ms robertson 
a 30year united veteran and past union president was unanimously 
elected by the unions master executive council ms holmes 
successor is to be chosen this month 
both ms holmes and msfriend plan to take some time off and 
then rejoin their colleagues flying the line

miniscribe corp said tuesday it has 
filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws 
because it was the only practical step in light of a series of 
investor lawsuits the company faces 
the longmont colobased maker of computer disk drives said it 
filed for chapter 11 reorganization monday in us bankruptcy court 
in denver the move had been expected in the financial and business 
community because of the pending lawsuits 
attracting the new infusion of equity capital that the company 
needs to take advantage of its new 7000 series family of oneinch 
high 3inch disk drives is impossible in the face of 13 class 
action and individual lawsuits brought by stockholders and 
debenture holders which together hold the potential of enormous 
liability for the company said miniscribe president richard p 
rifenburgh 
we believe that this is the only practical step the company 
can take to solve its many legal problems he said 
the bankruptcy filing follows an internal report in september 
concluding that former senior managers of miniscribe had 
perpetrated a massive fraud on the company over the past three 
years 
the report painted a picture of a company run amok under the 
direction of then chief executive officer qt wiles once known as 
the dr fix it of the hightech industry wiles resigned from the 
company last february 
miniscribe undertook the inhouse investigation under pressure 
from investor lawsuits which allege among other things that 
miniscribe officials made false and misleading statements to 
artificially inflate the companys stock 
the company previously announced it was phasing out its us 
manufactured products and by the end of the first quarter of 1990 
would have only a pilot production line sales and marketing 
research and development at its headquarters in longmont 
most of the companys production already had been taking place 
through its far east subsidiaries worldwide miniscribe employs 
5927 workers including 849 in the united states there were 110 
positions cut last year with the companys announcement it was 
ending its manufacturing lines here 
in conjunction with the bankruptcy filing the companys lending 
bank standard chartered of hong kong agreed in principal to 
permit the company to use the banks cash collateral and to provide 
debtorinpossession financing of up to 20 million miniscribe 
said but the bankruptcy court now will have to approve those plans 
the company also earlier retained merrill lynch to formulate a 
chapter 11 recapitalization and reorganization plan to allow the 
companys continuing operations to emerge as soon as possible from 
bankruptcy 
miniscribe said because of the complexity of the multiple claims 
against the company and its substantial negative net worth 
the reorganization may involve a purchase of assets by new 
investors to set up a new company with claims then being handled 
from the proceeds of the sale 
the company also filed its longdelayed form 10k with the 
securities and exchange commission showing totals assets of 200 
million and total liabilities of 351 million excluding any 
liabilities that could be established by the pending lawsuits 
the years of neglect of the companys financial accounting 
function have compounded the difficulty in arriving at these 
numbers rifenburgh said we have had to restate three years of 
financial statements frequently having to reconstruct records and 
utilizing a staff that has been seriously overburdened

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting wet weather in south america snowy forecasts at home 
and an anticipated increase in us soybean acreage 
expectations for new grain sales to the soviet union and romania 
limited the early losses 
weekend rainfall in south america helped the soybean crops 
there analysts said snow is expected this week in the great 
plains and midwest where any precipitation is welcome after two 
dry summers 
additional selling in the soybean complex stemmed from new 
agriculture department policies that are expected to increase 
soybean acreage this year a crop program rule announced friday 
will permit participating farmers to plant up to 25 percent of 
their base acreage with certain crops including soybeans 
the usda expects a gain of about a million acres of 
soybeans said william biedermann director of research with

the bush administration said today it will 
miss a jan 22 deadline for submitting a fiscal 1991 budget by one 
week 
in a letter to house and senate leaders budget director richard 
g darman apologized for the delay but said there was no way the 
administration could make the deadline for its first fullyear 
budget 
budgets have of course been late many times before darman 
said in a letter to senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine but i hope you may appreciate that i would have 
preferred to have been exactly on time rather than seven days 
late 
darman also said in a letter to house speaker thomas foley 
dwash that the chairman of the senate budget committee sen 
james sasser dtenn had balked at the prospect of a weeks delay 
unfortunately however we simply cannot deliver the budget by 
the 22nd of january and will have to delay its submission until 
jan 29th darman said 
the letters to mitchell and foley were both dated dec 29 
administration and congressional sources also disclosed another 
timing flap with congress over the date of president bushs state 
of the union address 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
congressional leaders balked at a white house proposal that the 
message be delivered on thursday jan 25 not wanting to return 
right before a weekend 
after a period of negotiations the date for the state of the 
union address is now set for tuesday jan 30 a day after the 
budget submission sources said 
darman said a principal reason for the budgetsubmission delay 
was because appropriations bills and a budgetcutting measure 
were late this year 
a socalled reconciliation bill chopping 147 billion from the 
current years fiscal deficit was one of the final measures enacted 
by congress before it began its christmas and new years holiday 
for reasons that i do not fully understand the congress did 
not actually deliver the reconciliation bill to the white house 
until dec 13th the president signed it on dec 19th for many 
years omb has been given at lest 45 days and ordinarily about 60 
days from enactment of the last major spending or reconciliation 
bill to prepare the next years budget 
if the customary minimum time were allowed this year the 
budget would not have to be presented until early feburary 
darman said in his letter to mitchell 
the measure will call for 123 trillion in spending sources 
said by law it must call for reducing the federal deficit to 64 
billion in the fiscal year that begins oct 1

a salvage firm today said it repaired an 
iranian supertanker that spewed millions of gallons of crude oil 
into the atlantic ocean off the moroccan coast but a french 
official disputed the claim 
three tugs towed the supertanker farther out to sea today and 
cleanup crews prepared for a 100squaremile oil slick to hit the 
coast 
the roughly 19 million gallons of crude that escaped the 
stricken vessel threatened oyster beds fishing stocks a pink 
flamingo breeding ground and resort beaches on monday officials 
said 100000 jobs depend on fishing and tourism in the affected 
area 
the spill was nearly double the 11 million gallons of crude oil 
dumped into alaskas prince william sound by the exxon valdez last 
year but a british shipping official said much of the oil has been 
broken up by high waves and dissolved in the warm water 
the dispersed oil is falling to the ocean bed unlike the oil in 
prince william sound said joe nichols technical manager of the 
international tanker owners pollution federation in britain 
the dutch salvage company smit tak said workers plugged a 60 by 
90foot hole in khark 5s port side 
we have done some repairs to the ship and we managed to stop 
the leak spokesman daan kaakebeen said from the companys 
headquarters in rotterdam the netherlands he said three tugs were 
towing the 1837ton ship out to sea 
irans environmental protection agency also said the spill had 
been contained and an agency spokesman said the imperialist 
media had exaggerated its seriousness 
however frances environment minister helping to coordinate 
cleanup operations for its former colony said the khark 5 was 
still leaking and a second tanker eventually would try to take 
aboard some of the remaining oil 
the huge oil slick moved to within 12 miles of the coast on 
monday and high winds could push some of the oil ashore by 
thursday said the french official brice lalond 
an explosion its cause unknown tore through the tankers hull 
dec 19 when it was about 400 miles north of the canary islands a 
fire forced the crew to abandon ship and the vessel began drifting 
toward northwest africa 
the ship originally loaded with 72 million gallons of oil bound 
for refineries in europe came within 50 miles of safi south of 
rabat before salvors towed it 120 miles off the coast the 
official moroccan news agency maghreb arab press said 
it said moroccan technicians were struggling to repair a gash in 
the hull that continued streaming light crude oil 
experts placed a barrier at the leading edge of the slick to 
prevent it from reaching a 106mile stretch of coastline spanish 
oilspill technicians on the scene and experts from marseille 
france say high winds and 8foot waves have slowed efforts to 
control the spill 
robert luigi an oilspill expert for the marseille port 
authority said moroccan authorities were coping well with the 
spill and the risk to coastal areas was slight 
luigi who returned to france on sunday after aiding local 
authorities for a week said much of the oil had evaporated or 
disintegrated into small particles due to the warm seas 
the slick threatened an area from mehdiya north of rabat the 
capital to mohammedia in the south the french tv station la cinq 
reported 
the slick could affect oyster beds at oualidyia and a migratory 
bird reserve at moulay bousselham also a key breeding ground of 
pink flamingoes authorities said it could blacken beaches around

we are now experiencing the muted impact of an 
economic soft landing the very thing the federal reserve sought 
and seers thought impossible but still the economic worries 
persist 
the great fear throughout last year was that the feds restraint 
of the money supply might stall the engine of economic growth in a 
manner similar to that of a commercial aircraft with a pinched fuel 
line 
such a situation could of course lead to a crash landing with 
widespread joblessness personal and commercial bankruptcies 
repossessed homes shattered confidence and an economy incapable of 
rising again for years 
there was no crash just the mushy sound of a great craft 
settling into the marsh 
corporate profits ceased to grow joblessness rose fractions of 
a point available factory capacity retreated from nearrecord 
highs inflation and interest rates fell savings rose the trade 
and budget balances declined 
forced to compete for market share in a slowgrowth economy 
manufacturers and retailers improved their efficiency and cut their 
prices which was painful to them but the consumer and the country 
got a better deal in the process 
while huge problems remain lenders must be bailed out 
business failures seem destined to rise houses are often beyond 
the reach of medianincome families healthcare costs continue to 
rise the landing has been soft 
worries however are among the factors that seem not to have 
abated 
the big new worry is that the economy now might sink slowly into 
the sludge and fail to take off when the time comes for 
reexpansion some examples 
while home mortgage rates have declined from their highs of a 
year ago home prices in many areas have not in part because of a 
slower pace of homebuilding that latter was a direct consequence 
of federal reserve restraints 
if the situation is to be remedied incomes must rise or more 
housing must be made available but in a nearrecession economy 
how do you spur either of those activities 
thanks to the slowdown carmakers are ready to make deals but 
because of the sluggish economy consumers are in perhaps their 
worst buying mood in a decade job insecurity has risen a bit also 
undermining buyer determination 
the saleinducing ability of rebates and belowmarket interest 
rates therefore have lost a good deal of their power the fed 
could try to push borrowing rates even lower but that could cause 
problems of another sort 
to guide a craft as large as the us economy is a tricky and 
uncertain assignment and there is no assurance the fed has full 
command of the controls precision is called for but economic 
gauges are inexact response is slow 
it took a year of monetary restraints by the fed from the 
early spring of 1988 to that of 1989 to slow an economy that 
seemed headed for inflationary trouble restraint began that is 
nearly two years ago 
the fed then began easing up on the controls last spring but 
nobody can say for certain when the impact of that easing will be 
felt later this year sometime in 1991 
it leaves lots of time for the economy to settle into the mire 
and for those who worry about such things it raises the possibility 
that a subsequent takeoff might be more difficult than foreseen

bank of boston corp echoing moves by new england 
banks in response to the regions slumping real estate market said 
tuesday it would write off about 300 million in loans for the 
final quarter of 1989 and set aside around 280 million for other 
possible losses 
however the company predicted it would break even in the 
quarter and earn a profit for the whole year partly due to its 
decision to sell its 590 million creditcard business 
bank of boston said it expected a gain of 145 million from the 
sale to chase manhattan corp of new york and a 50 million gain 
from the funding of a portion of its pension obligations with 
annuity contracts 
the acquisition of the creditcard unit was the fifth for chase 
in 1989 
about half of bank of bostons 300 million in net writeoffs 
or 140 million was for loans related to real estate said wayne 
j taylor a company spokesman about 40 million was due to 
problem loans to third world countries he said 
given the uncertainty of the economic environment generally 
and in new england we thought taking this kind of action would be 
prudent taylor said 
bank analysts said they expected the move which followed 
similar actions by other new england banks 
the bank of new england said last week that it expected to 
report a substantial loss for the year because it had to boost 
reserves to cover bad real estate loans on tuesday it announced 
the sale of its vehicle fleet leasing unit to ge capital corp for 
an undisclosed price 
every time there is a problem with real estate we start to 
see a problem with loans there is a certain level of fulfilled 
prophecy every time said mas kakutani a director of bank 
analysts for moodys investors service inc 
analysts said it was difficult to forsee the markets downturn 
from the boom years of the early 1980s 
in 2020 hindsight its always easy to say they bank of 
boston management made a mistake kakutani said its a little 
irresponsible for us to say that although they should have 
controlled their growth a little bit 
bank of boston said its nonperforming assets totaled 17 
billion at year end including 600 million in real estate 
holdings that was down from 18 billion in nonperforming assets 
reported in the thirdquarter a decline due mainly to the 
fourthquarter chargeoffs taylor said 
its still discouraging to see nonperforming assets at such a 
magnitude that will be a drag on them in the 90s said james 
moynihan senior vice president of advest inc in boston 
the bank said it expected total creditloss reserves of 925 
million or about 85 percent of an estimated 11 billion in 
nonaccrual loans and leases in the fourth quarter for the period 
ended sept 30 the bank reported nonaccrual loans and leases of 
15 billion and a creditloss reserve of 942 million or 62 
percent 
net income for the first nine months of 1989 totaled 62 million

the chicago board of trade largely in reaction to reports of rain 
in the south american soybean belt most grain futures also closed 
lower 
the south american soybean region encompassing the southern 
third of brazil and the northeastern section of argentina has 
received generous amounts of precipitation in recent weeks after a 
dry beginning to the growing season 
in fact brazil may be getting too much of a good thing 
said anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
she said the northern reaches of parana a major brazilian 
soybeangrowing state may be getting a little on the wet side 
william biedermann research director for the futures brokerage 
allendale inc linked additional selling in the soybean market to 
a change in the us government crop program allowing participating 
farmers to plant soybeans on some of their idled acres 
at the close soybean futures were 5 cents to 8 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in january at 561 a bushel wheat 
was cent lower to 1 cents higher with march at 408 a bushel

the dupont co has sold its blood 
screening business and will concentrate efforts on its core 
diagnostics business the chemical giant said tuesday 
ortho diagnostics systems inc a subsidiary of johnson amp 
johnson and chiron corp based in eneryville calif have 
purchased the blood screening business for an undisclosed price 
du pont became involved in the virology blood screening market 
in 1984 in partnership with biotech research laboratories inc 
based in rockville md the companies supplied tests to screen for 
and confirm the presence of aids and other diseases in donated 
blood 
ortho will now market biotechs blood screening products in the 
united states and other parts of the world but dupont will 
continue to market them in some european countries dupont will 
also continue to market biotechs research products worldwide 
we entered the market when there was a national priority to 
stop the rapid spread of aids through blood transfusions and we 
have had a major role in seeing that objective was achieved 
however continued participation in this area is not consistent 
with our strategic business objectives said john landon the 
director of diagnostics at dupont 
the sale is duponts first step toward increasing spending in 
its core diagnostics business and divesting nonstrategic 
diagnostic product lines developed or acquired recently the 
company said 
the company will spend five times as much on research and 
development in 1990 for its clinical chemistry business which 
manufactures and markets instruments and prepackaged chemical 
reagents for hospitals and reference laboratories dupont said 
the money will be used for development of advanced models of 
duponts aca and dimension instruments 
dupont will continue to develop and sell virology products to 
aids and viral disease researchers landon said 
dupont has annual healthcare sales of approximately 13 billion 
biotech is a producer of human viral diagnostic products

weakness persisted in the manufacturing sector 
during december but the pace of economic decline eased the 
nations purchasing managers reported tuesday 
the national association of purchasing management which tracks 
economic trends by polling its members each month said its index 
rose to 48 percent in december from 466 percent in november 
despite the unexpectedly big improvement in the widely followed 
index which raised it to the highest level since june 1989 the 
reading suggested the economy still was in a slump 
december marked the eighth straight month in which the index has 
come in below the dividing line between economic growth and 
decline a reading below 50 generally means that the manufacturing 
economy is deteriorating while a reading above 50 indicates it is 
expanding 
financial markets keep tabs on the purchasing managers monthly 
report on business for clues about economic health wall street 
welcomed the december report and the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks surged 5695 points to a record close of 
281015 surpassing its previous peak of 279141 reached last 
oct 9 
but the report was subject to varying interpretations 
it was regarded by some observers as additional evidence that 
the feeble economy needs to be livened up with a dose of lower 
interest rates it tended to support the notion that the federal 
reserve board should nudge rates lower to stimulate economic 
activity 
on the other hand the report was taken as a sign that the 
economic downturn may have bottomed out late last year some stock 
market analysts were cheered because they thought the purchasing 
managers had handed them a reason for optimism about the fortunes 
of industrial companies which have been held back by the sluggish 
economic conditions of the past year 
in a separate piece of encouraging news the commerce department 
reported construction spending jumped 15 percent in november 
rebounding from a 01 percent dip in october and reaching a 
10month high 
a 7 percent surge in goverment spending which accounts for 
roughly 20 percent of total construction outlays combined with a 
06 percent gain in residential spending to produce novembers 
overall growth 
the purchasing managers report based on replies to questions 
asked of purchasers at more than 300 industrials companies said 
both production and new orders posted slight increases helped by 
favorable seasonal adjustment factors 
inventories decreased marking a full year of monthly declines 
but at a lesser rate than in the past five months 
among the other components in the overall index manufacturing 
employment dropped for the eleventh straight month and vendor 
deliveries were faster for the eighth month in a row reflecting 
greater availability of goods against a backdrop of sluggish demand 
inflation continued to moderate prices declined for the seventh 
straight month but at a slightly higher rate than in november a 
total of 27 items were reported lower in price compared with only 
14 reported to be higher 
robert bretz chairman of the organizations business survey 
committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes 
inc said despite the modest improvement in the december index the 
readings in the vendor deliveries and price components confirm a 
continued weakness in the underlying economy 
the purchasing managers index averaged 49 percent for all of 
last year a level that is consistent with an increase of about 16 
percent in the gross national product the broadest measure of 
economic activity the index would have to slip below 44 percent 
for it to point to a contraction in inflationadjusted gnp 
the december level which was higher than the figure expected by 
financial market economists compared with 573 percent in december 
1988 and was the highest since 488 percent in june 1989 
economists had forecast the index would register around 47 percent 
in december

the financial markets were closed on monday for new years day 
although domestic and most european markets reopened tuesday 
trading was described as thin as tokyo extended the holiday and 
many offices here and abroad remained partially staffed 
therefore currency dealers said it remained to be seen whether 
the dollar was on its way up again after an extended decline in the 
last weeks of 1989 
most dealers attributed tuesdays dollar rally to internal 
market influences that were being exaggerated by the thinness of 
the market on the first trading day of the new year 
however they said the dollar would have closed even higher had 
it not been for at least four separate episodes of dollar selling 
by the fed for yen 
the yen remained under pressure because of japans relatively 
low interest rates and amid market concern about the future of that

once considered a miracle fiber asbestos is now 
recognized as a serious health threat and will be taken off the 
us market in a series of bans beginning this year but for 
utility workers like kevin quinn who says he was exposed to 
asbestos on the job the damage may already have been done 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
kevin quinns father began working for 
consolidated edison in the 1940s when asbestos was still 
considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its use 
william quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos 
his son was hired by the same utility in 1979 in the years 
since his father first came in contact with asbestos numerous laws 
had been passed to protect workers from what was now acknowledged 
as a prime health risk 
but in 1987 quinn says he was working at a plant when 
asbestoscovered doors were removed from boilers and dropped to the 
floor the doors remained for weeks while workers went about their 
duties without protective gear amid clouds of asbestos dust he 
says 
i used to walk past that area every day he says they 
told us it was safe and it turns out it wasnt 
now quinn has joined 180 coworkers and the environmental 
protection agency in suing con ed charging that he was exposed to 
the same material that killed his father 
eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating 
asbestos thousands of workers at utilities like con ed and in 
other industries where asbestos was used as an insulator still 
face its effects 
we are talking to people who are extremely surprised that 
asbestos is still a problem said heather maurer executive 
director of asbestos victims of america but the incidence of 
asbestos disease is on the increase instead of the decrease 
despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of 
asbestos safer 
a recent unionsponsored screening of 538 con edison workers 
found that 20 percent had either scarred lungs or mesothelioma an 
asbestoscaused cancer of the lining of the abdomen or the lungs 
since 1987 con ed has been cited by the occupational safety and 
health administration for more than a halfdozen alleged violations 
mostly failure to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air 
at the indian point nuclear plant in buchanan a plant in 
astoria queens and at quinns 74th street plant in manhattan 
some allegations are still under investigation some have been 
contested and dropped by osha and con ed settled others by paying 
a fine 
prior to 1973 we didnt know what the asbestos risks were 
said con ed spokeswoman rosalie zuckerman were not denying that 
prior to that time there was exposure but now that were aware of 
it whenever we do any asbestos work we follow all the 
regulations 
she added that since 1973 the company has had two medical vans 
visiting con ed plants carrying xray machines to test for 
asbestos scarring 
she would not comment on kevin quinns suit but quinn says the 
company was negligent in 1987 when he was exposed the workers he 
says were kept in the dark 
we didnt realize we were working around asbestos til a shop 
steward took an air sample to the white lung association he said 
because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop 
workers like quinn who believe they have been exposed recently may 
not become sick until the year 2020 and people who were exposed to 
asbestos in the 1950s 60s and 70s are just now getting sick 
a study by dr irving selikoff perhaps the worlds most noted 
asbestos researcher and his colleagues at the mount sinai school 
of medicine projects that asbestos cancer rates wont peak until 
1992 and wont drop off significantly until after the year 2000 
smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestosrelated lung cancer 
which is incurable in 70 to 95 percent of cases said dr stephen 
levin who works with selikoff mesothelioma is always fatal 
asbestos exposure also increases the risk of colon cancer which 
has an 80 percent cure rate if caught early 
the study predicts that 9739 deaths from asbestos exposure will 
be recorded in 1992 in just 11 industries including utilities 
construction car and railroad engine repair shipbuilding and 
asbestos manufacturing 
many con ed workers fear they might surface among those 
statistics 
gene duffy 46 has worked for con edison for 25 years his 
chest xrays show lung scarring he often has trouble breathing 
duffy said he cant even cut his lawn without taking a rest halfway 
through to catch his breath 
artie sagevick 58 a 31year veteran he gave up smoking 25 
years ago but he has coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple 
of times a day 
says steven amato a 21year employee if you had to do a 
strenuous job go up and down stairs i could not do it in the 
wintertime i throw the phlegm all day long im 51 years old 
and i feel like an old man 
all three want compensation from con ed more help from their 
union and along with many of their coworkers they are suing 
asbestos manufacturers 
lawyer chris placitella is handling similar suits by 130 con ed 
workers his firm represents 3300 additional workers from other 
utility companies who are involved in similar suits and the number 
of plaintiffs rises daily 
con edison has other asbestosrelated worries city officials 
have raised concerns about public exposure to asbestos from con ed 
accidents in several recent incidents asbestos insulation wrapped 
around underground con ed steam pipes has blown off when the pipes 
or nearby water mains burst 
one explosion killed three people and contaminated manhattans 
entire gramercy park neighborhood with asbestos forcing hundreds 
of people to relocate 
con ed was faulted for failing to report the presence of 
asbestos for several days which delayed the cleanup and increased 
health risks other accidents contaminated streets and subways 
the city department of environmental protection has called on 
federal officials to come up with new techniques to deal with these 
outdoor and underground emergencies since the usual procedures 
have not always applied 
most asbestos products will be taken off the us market under a 
threestage epa ban that begins in 1990 and ends in 1997 advocates 
for asbestos victims applaud the ban but wish more were being done 
asbestos manufacturers have filed a lawsuit challenging the ban 
claiming todays products are safe because the fiber is encased in 
hard materials like cement and wont deteriorate

markets reflects fundamental supply and demand factors

tightness in supplies would come at the peak usage time for heating

close at 281015 surpassing its previous closing high of 
279141 reached last oct 9

last halfhour of trading alone boosted by computerized buying 
programs

nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
1257 stocks rising 412 falling and 333 unchanged

tuesdays rally

national association of purchasing managements monthly survey of 
its members but after the association reported there was 
continuing weakness in the manufacturing economy last month prices 
moved broadly higher 
the purchasing managers index gained in december rising to 48 
percent from novembers 466 percent but it was the eighth 
straight month that the purchasing managers have reported weakness 
in the industrial sector a reading below 50 percent generally 
indicates a slowing of the economy and it was this fact that 
motivated investors 
traders believed the continuing weakness would make the federal 
reserve more likely to nudge interest rates lower 
analysts said gains in the dollar also supported the rally on 
wall street a stronger dollar gives the fed more leeway with 
interest rates and it also makes us stocks more attractive to 
foreign investors

orange juice futures prices rose sharply tuesday after florida 
and brazilian juice processors announced cash price increases of 
more than 20 percent in reaction to frost damage to the florida 
orange crop 
on other commodity markets energy futures prices climbed 
precious metals dipped grains and soybean were lower and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
in trading on the new york cotton exchange futures prices for 
frozen concentrated orange juice soared the expanded daily limit of 
8 cents a pound for all contracts except the spot january contract 
which rose 46 cents to 170 per pound 
the increase brought the contracts gain since dec 15 to nearly 
35 percent 
the buying followed announcements late friday and early tuesday 
that most florida orange juice processors had raised their 
effective cash discount price for bulk juice to about 168 from 
133 per pound brazilian processors followed suit increasing 
their rate to about 163 from 134 a pound 
a cash price increase was expected in the wake of a christmas 
weekend freeze in the florida citrus belt that some analysts 
believe destroyed as much as 30 percent of the states orange crop 
florida officials have not estimated the damage 
the damage is expected to lead to an increase in us imports of 
brazilian juice which accounted for about 21 percent of us 
consumption in the year ended dec 2 1989 
ernie thomas an orange juice specialist in winter haven fla 
with merrill lynch consumer markets said he was surprised by the 
magnitude of the price increases but he said the futures market 
overreacted 
there are a lot of shorts in there desperately trying to get 
out at any price he said 
the term shorts refers to traders who sold borrowed contracts 
earlier hoping the price would decline before they would have to 
buy contracts to complete their deals 
energy futures prices rose sharply in brisk trading on the new 
york mercantile exchange amid buying on speculation about tight 
supplies 
the gasoline market took the lead and heating oil followed 
reflecting forecasts for warmer weather in the northeast and 
concerns about problems at several oil refineries in pennsylvania 
and along the gulf coast 
these are no big deals in and of themselves but when you get a 
lot of news floating around that tends to spark a little buying 
said jim ritterbusch vice president of trading and research with 
carson petroleum co a chicagoarea oil distributor 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 58 cent to 107 cents 
higher with february at 2289 a barrel heating oil was 142 cents 
to 214 cents higher with february at 7739 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 105 cents to 394 cents higher with february 
at 6569 cents a gallon 
precious metals futures slid lower led by platinum in reaction 
to weaker foreign currency values but gold for february delivery 
halted its slide at 40020 an ounce just above 400 level that 
some analysts consider an indicator of the markets strength 
gold futures settled 310 to 390 lower with february at 
40210 a troy ounce silver was 2 cents to 25 cents lower with 
march at 5253 a troy ounce 
soybean futures prices fell sharply on the chicago board of 
trade largely in reaction to reports of rain in the south american 
soybean belt most grain futures also closed lower 
soybean futures settled 4 cents to 8 cents lower with january 
at 561 a bushel wheat was cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
march at 408 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with

miniscribe corp the computer disk maker 
hurt by allegations of mismanagement and fraud has filed for 
bankruptcy protection and called the step the only practical 
strategy to solve its legal problems 
the company said it sought protection in a chapter 11 filing 
monday with the us bankruptcy court in denver it listed 
liabilities that exceed assets by 151 million but those figures 
dont include a potentially unlimited liability from lawsuits filed 
by angry shareholders and debtholders 
the chapter 11 filing which gives the company a reprieve from 
creditors while reorganizing had been expected because of the 
lawsuits which allege miniscribe grossly misrepresented past 
financial results 
an internal investigation prompted by the lawsuits concluded 
former managers perpetrated a massive fraud by fabricating 
financial statements and sometimes shipping bricks and scrap parts 
disguised as disk drives to confuse auditors 
this fraud was all the more alarming in that it required the 
active participation of many company personnel and was apparently 
common knowledge among a great many other employees said the 
internal report given to the enforcement division of the 
securities and exchange commission 
in a prepared statement tuesday miniscribe president richard p 
rifenburgh said attracting the new infusion of equity capital 
that the company needs to take advantage of its new 7000 series 
family of oneinch high 3inch disk drives is impossible in the 
face of 13 class action and individual lawsuits brought by 
stockholders and debenture holders which together hold the 
potential of enormous liability for the company 
we believe that this is the only practical step the company 
can take to solve its many legal problems he said 
the company previously announced it was phasing out usbuilt 
products and by the end of the first quarter of 1990 will have only 
a pilot production line sales and marketing research and 
development at its headquarters in longmont 
most of the companys production already is done through far 
east subsidiaries worldwide miniscribe employs 5927 including 
849 in the united states 
shearson lehman hutton inc analyst doug van dorsten who 
follows miniscribe said the chapter 11 filing could force owners 
of its stock and debt securities to unite and perhaps try to 
negotiate with the company 
i think more than anything else miniscribe would like to get 
those different parties together and move toward a settlement he 
said miniscribe needs to settle that if the company is to move 
forward 
miniscribes new 7000 series of disk drives has received high 
reviews in the computer industry and its 1989 sales were strong 
but the companys future has been clouded by the legal problems 
the company said it had retained merrill lynch amp co to 
formulate a chapter 11 recapitalization and reorganization plan 
the company also filed a longdelayed form 10k financial 
statement with the sec showing totals assets of 200 million and 
total liabilities of 351 million excluding liabilities that could 
be established by the lawsuits

a prospective key witness in the governments 
defense of its seizing of lincoln savings and loan association is 
refusing to testify attorneys said tuesday 
arizona real estate developer ec garcia has told the 
government through attorneys he will invoke his fifth amendment 
protection against selfincrimination if called as a witness in a 
suit challenging the federal takeover of the irvine calif 
thrift said paul guterman an attorney for the government 
government attorneys had told us district court judge stanley 
sporkin in december that they expected garcia to be their top 
witness testifying about what they say was the siphoning by 
lincolns owner phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr of 
millions of dollars in federally insured deposits from the 
nowcollapsed institution 
garcia was the principal participant in two transactions one 
involving a stockjunk bond deal and the other a sale of 1000 
acres of land outside phoenix which the government contends 
resulted in the taking of more than 16 million from lincoln 
despite gutermans comments sporkin said he still wanted garcia 
to take the stand in the case 
attorneys for lincoln and its parent company american 
continental corp of phoenix said they intend to subpoena garcia 
as a witness if the government drops its demand that he appear 
james murphy another attorney for the government in the case 
said he expected to call keating and his son charles h keating 
iii as witnesses on thursday or friday 
murphy said he will call one of keatings soninlaws robert m 
wurzelbacher jr as a witness wednesday wurzelbacher as a senior 
vice president for american continental was the key participant in 
one land transaction that the government is citing as an example of 
phony land sales by lincoln 
the government contends that through a series of bogus land 
transactions lincoln recorded unwarranted profits in order to 
funnel depositors savings to american continental 
the elder keating who is now the target of a federal grand jury 
investigation in los angeles invoked his constitutional protection 
against selfincrimination in refusing two months ago to answer 
questions in a subpoenaed appearance before the house banking 
committee 
meanwhile the governments chief regulator in the case 
acknowledged in testimony tuesday that the savings and loan had 
told federal regulators in early 1986 about a tax arrangement the 
government now says was used to siphon 94 million in federally 
insured deposits out of the thrift 
kevin oconnell the regulator who recommended the governments 
seizure of lincoln last april at a cost of up to 2 billion 
potentially the heaviest loss to taxpayers among some 600 thrift 
failures admitted officials began questioning the taxsharing 
arrangement only last year 
oconnell deputy director of the treasury departments office 
of thrift supervision had testified last month that the 
arrangement between lincoln and american continental corp was 
illegal on its face 
under crossexamination today by attorneys for keating 
oconnell acknowledged that lincoln had provided details of the 
accord to his agency all along and that the agreement had been 
approved by regulators in california 
the arrangement under which american continental collected 
taxes allegedly owed by lincoln but never paid to the internal 
revenue service is a centerpiece of the governments claim that 
lincoln was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner in 
violation of the law 
washington took no action on the taxsharing agreement that 
you say was illegal on its face robert huffman an attorney for 
lincoln asked oconnell 
thats correct oconnell answered 
the testimony came in the third day of hearings into a suit by 
keating seeking to regain control of lincoln keating has charged 
in the suit that the governments decision to seize control of the 
thrift was capricious and arbitrary 
earlier tuesday a tucson real estate agent testified that he 
was a straw man for garcias purchase of a 1000acre parcel 
near phoenix from lincoln in march 1987 for 14 million 
fernando r acosta said he never put up one penny of his own 
cash in the transaction and that he allowed the property to be put 
on his companys books as a favor to garcia 
it wasnt until a year later when lincoln tried to collect the 
first payment on a 105 million loan for the parcels purchase 
that he learned that lincoln also was the seller of the land 
acosta said 
after acosta answered more than a dozen questions with i dont 
know the judge said he was reminded of a television 
advertisement for nike athletic shoes featuring rhythm and blues 
singer bo diddley 
sporkin said of acosta he gets into a cab goes to a strange 
place and leaves owning 14 million in property its like that 
diddley commercial he doesnt know diddley 
in addition to being the subject of the federal grand jury probe 
in los angeles keating is the target of a 11 billion federal 
fraud and racketeering suit 
until last week the 11 defendants in that suit also included 
keatings brother william j keating a former twoterm republican 
congressman who is chief executive officer of the detroit newspaper 
agency and chairman of the board of directors of the associated 
press on friday federal attorneys dismissed charges against 
william keating who had been accused of negligence and breach of 
fiduciary duty

csx corp said tuesday that cuts in 
railroad expenses helped boost its fourthquarter earnings by 2 
percent 
earnings for the three months ended dec 31 were 125 million 
or 125 a share up from 122 million or 101 a share for the 
same quarter last year revenue totaled 2034 billion down 
slightly from 2048 billion in 1988s fourth quarter 
earnings for all of 1989 more tripled from 147 million or 93 
cents a share in 1988 to 452 million or 434 a share however 
a work force reduction program in 1988 resulted in a pretax 
special charge that reduced earnings that year by 492 million 
revenue for 1989 totaled 775 billion down from 759 billion 
in 1988 
john w snow president of the richmondbased transportation 
company said the fourthquarter results show that efforts to 
reduce operating expenses on the railroad are clearly taking effect 
and helped overcome challenges presented by service suspensions due 
to severe december weather lower traffic volumes and substantially 
higher fuel costs 
fourthquarter rail revenue declined by 56 million or 4 
percent largely because of a 22 percent drop in new automobile 
shipments the company reported 
csx blamed the harsh weather for a decrease in coal traffic from 
464 million tons a year ago to 439 million tons for the fourth 
quarter of 1989 coal traffic for the year was 1753 million tons 
an increase of 1 million tons over 1988 
given the low stockpiles the apparent resolution of the 
pittston strike and heavy demands on utilities due to severe winter 
weather we expect strong coal loadings in the first quarter of 
1990 snow said 
the csx report was issued a day after federal mediators and 
officials of the united mine workers union and the pittston co 
announced a tentative settlement of a 9monthold strike that had 
idled 1700 miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky

officials predicted little environmental 
damage after 10000 gallons of gasoline leaked into the monongahela 
river from a runaway barge and a second loose barge was recovered 
tuesday with its cargo intact 
the two vessels were among at least 55 barges that were ripped 
from their moorings along a 58mile stretch of river on new years 
day by chunks of ice rushing through the rain and snowswollen 
waters thirty sank some of which were empty and the others loaded 
with coal 
we were very fortunate more barges werent loaded with fuel 
said senior chief ronald bogdan of the coast guards marine safety 
office in pittsburgh 
we believe there will be minimal environmental damage said 
chuck duritsa regional director of the pennsylvania department of 
environmental resources 
unlike two years ago when 750000 gallons of diesel oil gushed 
from a ruptured ashland oil inc tank into the monongahela the 
gasoline that leaked monday was lighter and more volatile and thus 
able to evaporate more easily duritsa said 
the jan 2 1988 spill fouled drinking water for residents in 
three states and killed about 11000 fish and 2000 waterfowl 
mondays spill did not affect drinking water said betsy 
mallison a spokeswoman for the environmental resources agency 
a water plant at east liverpool ohio about 50 miles down the 
ohio river from pittsburgh detected a trace of the gasoline 
tuesday but it did not represent a health threat and could be 
removed by the plants carbon filtering system said jeanne ison 
spokeswoman for the ohio river valley water sanitation commission 
the coast guard and state agencies prepared to round up the 
loose barges including seven jammed against the maxwell dam 61 
miles upstream from pittsburgh 
a 20mile stretch of the river remained closed to traffic 
because of the sunken barges the army corps of engineers planned 
to begin searching for those barges with sonar later this week 
our biggest concern was getting these petroleum barges out 
which was taken care of bogdan said 
the two oil product barges and an empty barge were knocked from 
their moorings early monday at speers about 30 miles south of 
pittsburgh 
one barge containing 420000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel 
was pried tuesday from a lock and dam at charleroi about two miles 
downstream and pulled to shore for inspection 
the other two barges went over the lock and dam at charleroi 
the loaded barge which was carrying 336000 gallons of unleaded 
gasoline hit a bridge before coming to rest at new eagle about 14 
miles further downstream the barge likely ruptured when it went 
over the dam but it was not known when the gasoline started 
leaking bogdan said 
police and fire officials in river communities were notified of 
the spill 
we dont want anybody throwing matches in there and lighting 
the thing up thats all we needed was a 20mile flame bogdan 
said 
the leaking barge was contained monday morning cleanup crews 
pumped the remaining 326000 gallons of gasoline into an ashland 
oil barge late monday and early tuesday the salvaged fuel was 
taken to ashlands floreffe terminal 27 miles upstream from 
pittsburgh the site of the 1988 spill 
thirtyseven barges broke loose monday from moorings in 
brownsville near the maxwell dam 
another 15 barges owned by ltv steel co broke loose on the 
monongahela three miles upstream from pittsburgh early monday and 
floated as far as six miles down the ohio river three became stuck 
beneath the smithfield street bridge in downtown pittsburgh 
forcing officials to close the span temporarily those barges were 
removed tuesday 
in new jersey a ruptured underwater pipeline spilled 5000 
gallons of heating oil into the arthur kill causing an 11mile 
slick on the heavily traveled channel separating new jersey and the 
new york city borough of staten island 
cleanup of the spill ranked as small by the coast guard was 
expected to take about one week said petty officer jeff crawley at 
the guard station at governors island ny much of the fuel is 
expected to evaporate 
the 12inch pipe connects exxons bayway refinery and chemical 
plant in linden and its refinery in bayonne the joint facility is 
exxons largest refinery on the east coast
