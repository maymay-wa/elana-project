the floods of japanese tourists 
have ebbed sales are off by a third at some of the priciest stores 
in the universe 
longtime merchants lament that only cartier can afford the rent 
indeed some storefronts sit empty at the height of the shopping 
season 
but can the word recession ever apply on rodeo drive 
after all this is where they just opened a 200 million 
minimall with 100000 handset cobblestones this is where 8000 
bustiers still sll at giorgio armani hostesses drop 3000 on 
pillboxes for party favors and some sales clerks have sixfigure 
incomes 
retails slow right now so you just have to work harder 
said amen wardy of the store of the same name who began markdowns 
at thanksgiving to move merchandise 
sweaters originally priced at 2050 could be had for a mere 
525 on one recent day the price of leather jackets had shrunk 
from 3360 to 800 
still wardy continues to do a bustling business in nonsale 
musthaves like sparkling judith leiber handbags costing up to 
5000 
some of the gleaming clutches are designed like slices of 
watermelon or orange bags custommade to resemble your dog are 
tagged at 2400 
the other evening we sold 12 to one person said saleswoman 
bette donnell or someone will come in and take 12 of the 
pillboxes as favors for a dinner party 
the pillboxes rhinestoneencrusted baubles shaped like little 
partridges and turbans cost 180 to 305 each 
signals are similarly mixed up and down rodeo this 
recessionstruck holiday season 
rodeo is slower than ive ever seen it said avi amiel 
associate director at the hanson art galleries who has worked on 
the street for six years he said sales are off up to 30 percent 
this time of year the street is usually so crowded you can 
hardly walk out there now you can roller skate without hitting 
anyone amiel said 
next door at giorgio though salesman johnny zavala said 
signature items such as the perfume 1000 cashmere sweat 
suits and 300 sweat shirts beaded with austrian lead crystal 
continue to sell to tourists from around the world 
and at chanel where a standard womans suit runs 3000 and 
some cost 18000 regular customers continue to buy five or six a 
year said trini abellan who has sold clothing at the boutique for 
nearly six years 
she says she has heard that some shops on rodeo are hurting but 
chanel remains a classic for instance last year i sold a 
certain amount of millions this year i sold more 
rodeo drive has always been expensive but over the past decade 
its become less of a village center for locals and more a 
playground for the wealthiest jetsetters on every continent and a 
huge attraction for tourists of every social strata 
alan austin has run his womens clothing store just off rodeo 
for 26 years he complains that foreign tourists care only about 
labels and only the top retail names in the world can afford to 
rent space in places like two rodeo drive 
thats the brandnew 200 million development designed to look 
like shops on a street in europe it increases the retail space on 
rodeo by 60 percent christian dior valentino and cartier have 
moved in the platinum gold and diamond earrings in tiffany amp 
cos window cost 123000 
like wardy austin began putting items on sale at thanksgiving 
because his inventory was so high with the dollar weak prices 
have gone through the roof on his italian and french clothing that 
has caused even wealthy locals to cut back on spending unlike 
during the last recession he said

the deceptively alertlooking eyesopen 
unconciousness that envelops nancy cruzan and perhaps 10000 
other americans is difficult for families of the patients to 
accept 
in the condition called persistent vegetative state the eyes 
move about and sometimes react to sound patients may grimace 
smack their lips and seem to smile they sleep and wake up 
but these are simply reflexes the patients have permanent brain 
damage that prevents consciousness 
theyre just as unconscious as patients in a coma in which 
eyes are closed and the patient cannot be aroused said dr ron 
cranford an expert on persistent vegetative states 
it looks like theyre perfectly normal so its very hard 
on the family and health care providers to accept the fact that 
theyre not there 
it takes months or years for a family to come to terms with that 
and the lack of hope for recovery said cranford a neurologist at 
the hennepin county medical center in minneapolis 
a vegetative state is called persistent if there is no hope of 
recovery a person may still recover fully after six months to a 
year in a vegetative state if it was caused by a head injury 
especially in children cranford said 
but if the patient suffered loss of blood or oxygen to the 
brain as cruzan did recovery can be ruled out after one to three 
months he said 
cruzans condition has persisted since a 1983 auto accident 
last friday her feeding tube was removed after a lengthy court 
battle doctors said she would die from dehydration within a week 
or two of the tubes removal 
shes not in pain shes not suffering in any way because 
the brain centers that would let her perceive pain and suffering 
are destroyed said cranford who has examined her 
in her last two to three days she will go into a coma and then 
shell die a quiet peaceful death he said 
if death is inevitable in such cases why not give a lethal 
injection and get it over with sparing the family a long death 
watch 
that is homicide notes robert veatch director of the kennedy 
institute of ethics at georgetown university the question of 
legalization will draw much more serious debate in the coming 
decade he said 
one argument against legalization suggests that if it is allowed 
for a clearcut case it will then be allowed later for more shaky 
cases so that all sorts of people are getting killed that 
shouldnt be he said 
that fear is at least worth worrying about veatch said 
another argument is the idea that its simply wrong to kill in 
these situations even if it is ethically acceptable to let 
somebody die he said 
many people may have a gut feeling that there is a difference 
he said but it is not clear whether that reaction occurs because 
there really is a difference or because people have been taught 
all their lives that there is one he said 
that question will be debated in upcoming years but for now 
i think the difference is worthy of very serious consideration 
veatch said 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota said he sees no ethical reason to 
hasten cruzans death for the sake of others 
no one said that death is supposed to be easy on other 
people he said

bud stanleys front yard is decorated like 
a desert this holiday season the saudi arabian desert to be 
exact 
while neighbors put santa claus on the roof and a nativity scene 
or menorah in the front yard stanley created a desert shield 
christmas to honor the men and women stationed in saudi arabia 
stanleys yard is in tulare about 50 miles south of fresno in 
central california it has holiday lights reindeer and other 
traditional decorations but theyre scattered among sand dunes 
palm trees a camouflaged jeep and military pup tents even 
fatigues hanging on a line 
and of course a jet 
an actual a4 jet loaned by nearby lemoore naval air station is 
the finishing touch on stanleys holiday tribute to the soldiers 
involved in desert shield stanley has even created a 
realisticlooking runway complete with blinking blue running 
lights 
it turned out pretty good said the 20yearold who has 
created extravagant displays every christmas since 1986 but i 
didnt expect it to go this far frankly 
stanley who lives with his parents helps run the familys 
chain of convenience stores he said he did the display to honor 
soldiers taking part in desert shield especially his friend corey 
kuykendall on active duty with a tank division in saudi arabia 
its to show the men and women out there that we love them 
he said we want them to have a good christmas 
stanley began working on the display the day after thanksgiving 
and put in over 150 hours before it was complete 
once the idea of a display in honor of the troops in saudi 
arabia was decided upon the display took off stanley said in a 
telephone interview the chief of police told him about a sergeant 
who wanted to loan him pup tents and other military regalia 
he asked me if i wanted an a4 fighter and i said no way 
stanley recalled it really blew my mind 
navy officials loaned a strippeddown fighter jet frequently 
used for parade floats 
i think it was a good thing to do said lemoore spokesman 
dennis mcgrath we thought about desert shield and it being 
christmas season we decided what the heck lets do it 
mcgrath said the jets engine and hydraulic system were pulled 
and the only real concern was security police officers in this san 
joaquin valley community 150 miles north of los angeles agreed to 
keep a constant watch over the jet 
by the end of the season the display will cost stanley between 
1000 and 1500 in electricity bills alone however all the 
equipment and displays are on loan even the full team of reindeer 
was donated by an archery club 
out of the roughly 1000 people who visit the display ever 
night several stop to thank him 
we have had some ladies and men drop by to tell us that they 
have a husband or wife over there and they thank us he said 
but this is all to thank them

could something as simple as books and pamphlets 
about the lifestyles of ordinary japanese help solve japans image 
problem in the united states 
japanese officials say they sure hope so and theyre putting 
money on it 
the government at the urging of former foreign minister 
shintaro abe is setting up a 370 million fund for public 
relations and joint usjapanese research on common problems 
foreign ministry officials say the effort is necessary given 
polls showing that americans view japan as a serious economic 
threat 
abe a senior legislator of the governing liberal democratic 
party proposed the japanus global partnership fund in june 
during a visit to washington the idea was later endorsed by prime 
minister toshiki kaifu 
american people feel the japanese are always very efficient 
that they band together among themselves and their only goal is to 
make profits said a foreign ministry official on condition of 
anonymity 
but we share many problems in common such as educating our 
kids and the aging of our societies if there are many 
opportunities for americans to get acquainted japanese will look 
more human he said 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said the fund was set 
up in response to apprehension about deterioration of trust 
because of a lack of communication efforts 
its a slightly more pragmatic approach to an old problem first 
dealt with in 1972 when the government set up the japan 
foundation 
that semigovernmental institution has supported worldwide 
teaching and student exchanges as well as research on japan but 
has done little to educate the nonacademic community in the united 
states the foreign ministry official said 
the relations between our two countries have outgrown the 
realm of scholarship these days even americans who dont study 
japan have to know about it because of the size of our economy 
he said 
in a supplementary national budget approved monday the global 
partnership fund received 300 million directly from the government 
and another 746 million from the japan foundation its 
expenditures will be limited to interest earned on the capital or 
about 25 million to 30 million a year 
that money will be used to provide us universities and public 
libraries with publications aimed at explaining the japanese 
people it also will fund think tanks for joint research on common 
problems including environmental issues and aging in both 
societies the official said 
the fund is the latest in a series of moves indicating growing 
dissatisfaction among japanese officials with their image overseas 
last week two other influential liberal democrats flew to the 
united states seeking to calm anger among black leaders over a 
comment by justice minister seiroku kajiyama comparing american 
blacks to prostitutes in japan who ruin the atmosphere of 
neighborhoods they move into 
in recent years the foreign ministry also has tried to improve 
japans relations with other asian and third world countries 
through more cultural exchanges and educational programs 
but japanese propaganda efforts overseas frequently are met with 
skepticism 
americans are tired of hearing that the real problem is they 
dont have a deep understanding of japan says robert m orr jr 
director of the stanford japan center in kyoto western japan 
the japanese idea is that if you disagree with them then you 
dont understand them

hippie icon wavy gravy was right when he 
predicted recently that the 1990s will be like the 1960s turned 
upside down and inside out a survey of stanford university 
students suggests 
two stanford anthropologists who have surveyed student attitudes 
for 38 years predict that the 1990s may resemble the vietnam war 
era with a rise in extremism on both ends of the political 
spectrum 
i wouldnt be surprised if there was a fairly substantial form 
of radicalism said george spindler who along with his wife 
louise has queried stanford students each year since harry truman 
was president 
an upsurge in extreme rightwing views will occur because the 
middleclass feels increasingly threatened by societal 
uncertainties and minorities the spindlers say 
leftist extremism could rise from the threat of war in the 
middle east and the specter of recession they said 
the survey indicated increased tension among young adults and 
middleaged people the survey with 24 openended statements was 
given to students aged 17 to 45 
from several hundred to 4000 people have responded each year 
since 1952 
different eras show marked changes in attitudes in the 1950s a 
majority of respondents completed the statement the future 
is with rosy or a similar positive word the spindlers 
said 
today most said the future is dismal or something to 
worry about they said 
but black chicano and asian respondents didnt seem as insecure 
about the future as their white counterparts 
george spindler conceded the survey of of elite college students 
may not fully reflect the views of average americans 
but university populations set the trend he said then it 
filters down and causes changes in other populations

in this country where only one percent of the 
population is christian christmas is celebrated lavishly with 
fancy dinners hotel floor shows and most importantly the 
exchanging of extravagant gifts 
christmas is a fullfledged festival here largely because the 
japanese delight in exchanging gifts and are drawn to things 
western 
as the holiday approaches christmas trees poinsettias and 
holly brighten shop windows kids eagerly await presents and the 
strains of familiar carols mingle with the chorus of salvation army 
volunteers outside department stores 
but for those of courting age noel means romance spending 
christmas eve alone is the ultimate embarrassment and efforts to 
make the right impression can top 1000 
do you know who youre spending christmas eve with the 
popular magazine hot dog asks its young male readers before 
providing detailed pointers on the right clothes restaurant hotel 
and seduction techniques for the holiday 
although dec 24 is no different from any other of the 365 
days of the year its even more important than your birthday 
the magazine says youve got to do very careful research into 
what shes hoping for on christmastheres a mountain of things 
to do 
japanese begin making restaurant and hotel reservations for the 
big night as early as april dinner shows with tabs starting at 
225 a person popular hotels and tours to such places as hawaii 
guam and southeast asia fill up as soon as reservations open 
then there are the gifts 
department stores ring up 25 percent of their total annual sales 
in december because of christmas and the tradition of offering 
yearend presents to express appreciation for favors 
annual sales of christmas gifts total about 115 billion about 
half for toys 
another substantial chunk of christmas sales are to denimclad 
college men many of whom crowd beside ladies swathed in mink at 
tiffanys and other posh stores looking for a coveted pendant or 
ring for their sweethearts 
a fashionable christmas eve a gift worth at least 200 a day 
at tokyos disneyland and dinner and a room at a nearby luxury 
hotel can cost about 1000 
young bachelors typically moonlight scrimp and sometimes go 
into debt to pay for one evenings extravagance 
christmas eve costs at the very least about 530 and the man 
has to pay for all of it its really hard said one 23yearold 
photographer 
the celebration mystifies some japanese 
the obsession of a christmas for two the weekly magazine 
asahi journal called the phenomenon in a headline 
since when did christmas become such a festival radio 
announcer shoko yoshida said in a commentary in the newspaper 
sankei shimbun recently its not the money that counts has 
changed to money is everything 
an accompanying cartoon shows three santa clauses around a sales 
chart i dont want to go to japan says one santa japans 
disgusting says another 
the ostentatious christmas eve is a relatively new phenomenon in 
japan where the holiday has long been a family affair 
since the end of world war ii japanese families have celebrated 
the holiday with a gift or two for each child and a dinner of 
roast chicken and an ornately decorated christmas cake 
when i was a kid christmas usually meant dad would come home 
drunk because it was bonus season says one young father now 
we celebrate it as a family even though we arent at all 
christian 
the government estimates this nation of 122 million people has 
slightly more than a million christians most other japanese 99 
percent practice both buddhism and the indigenous shinto religion 
japans first noel was about 400 years ago when christianity 
arrived with western missionaries and merchants the religion was 
unwelcome for almost three centuries forcing believers to worship 
in secret 
today japanese worship freely and growing numbers of young 
nonchristians are attending christmas eve services drawn by the 
universal theme of peace and goodwill

about 200 american soldiers have 
sought advice on how to avoid service in the persian gulf and at 
least 30 are applying for conscientious objector status an 
american counseling network says 
but the us military says the problem of soldiers not wanting 
to face possible combat is minuscule considering the number of 
those who are willing to go 
the american group which calls itself the military counseling 
network has begun operating throughout germany to advise us 
soldiers on their rights 
they make contact with the gis by handing out leaflets at the 
us bases in germany that the soldiers are being deployed from 
said andre stoner a member of the group 
stoner 28 of harrisonburg va and his wife cathy 23 of 
lancaster pa advise the soldiers and their families from their 
home in krastel in the hunsrueck region of germany about 90 miles 
west of frankfurt 
janice hill 32 of philadelphia does the same from her home in 
rottenburg about 36 miles south of stuttgart and a roman catholic 
priest the rev mike baxter counsels soldiers in the northern 
port city of bremen 
we are a counseling group and advise the soldiers on how they 
can legally apply for conscientious objector status stoner said 
we dont tell them to desert or to do anything illegal 
he said the network which is supported by church and peace 
groups in the united states had received about 200 telephone calls 
from interested soldiers so far and at least 30 of them are in 
the process of applying for conscientious objector status 
while some of the soldiers fit the traditional description of a 
conscientious objector who has an abhorrence for war of any kind 
others do not stoner said 
he said some of the soldiers were selective conscientious 
objectors meaning they would ordinarily be willing to fight to 
protect freedom in the united states 
but they say i dont think this is a just war and im not 
willing to fight to protect some oil sheik and george bushs 
political career stoner said 
he said response had been so great that additional network 
members were called in from the united states to help advise 
soldiers baxter was among them 
baxter 35 a priest with the holy cross order in albany ny 
said he has been in bremen just one week 
ive been in contact over the phone with about 15 or 20 gis 
ive really advised concretely seven or eight and they are in 
the process of applying for conscientious objector status baxter 
said 
baxter who describes himself as a christian pacifist said the 
military was now requiring most soldiers being sent to saudi arabia 
to wait until they reach the gulf before applying for conscientious 
objector status 
were trying to submit the application here in germany and 
fix an agreement with the military that these people do not have to 
handle weapons baxter said 
ms hill said she was also getting dozens of calls from soldiers 
and their wives she said some of the soldiers had already gone 
awol which is something we never advise anyone to do because 
its a lousy life 
an army spokesman in heidelberg capt dee jepson said the army 
does not consider conscientious objection to be a big problem 
the problemis minuscule he said

a set of rules for bell ringers issued in 1694 
warned all you that do intend to ring you undertake a dangerous 
thing 
three centuries later the british medical journal has 
documented the truth of these words in an article that is a litany 
of bell ringers bruises and broken bones 
dr ac lamont a pediatric radiologist and dr njm london 
of the leicester royal infirmary surveyed injuries among church 
bell ringers there are about 40000 in england and they ring 
bells from 3000 towers each sunday at easter and on christmas 
for the article appearing saturday the doctors reviewed the 
last six years of ringing world magazine looking for articles 
on injuries and accidents they advertised in the trade magazine 
for ringers who had suffered mishaps and sent questionnaires to 20 
active bell towers bringing a response from 221 ringers 
the injuries identified included torn fingernails fractures 
bruises corneal abrasions rope burns extracted teeth 
lacerations accidental near hangings pulled muscles ruptured 
ligaments and heads caught in rope loops 
five deaths were counted 
the doctors survey indicated that about 724 injuries befall 
ringers in the british isles each year half of which require first 
aid or other medical attention 
many ringers who returned the questionnaires insisted that 
ringing is very safe but our results show that this view is rather 
optimistic the doctors wrote in the journals christmas issue 
they added that pride may have prevented some bell ringers from 
reporting injuries 
learning to control a bell takes time and practice the article 
notes pupils of pealing must develop coordination to strike the 
bell in its proper place at varying speeds and intervals while 
avoiding bodily damage it said 
novices commonly fall prey to the most notorious hazard of bell 
ringing the high speed lift this occurs the doctors wrote 
when the bells stay breaks the bell goes out of balance and the 
ringer who forgets to release the rope is whisked towards the 
ceiling at a speed approaching 55 mph 
one letter to the doctors described the harrowing moments after 
a bell weighing about 1000 pounds went over balance and the bell 
ringer went with it 
i could hear voices telling me to let go let go and all i 
could think was i am not going to drop that far onto the cement 
floor so i kept going right to the top until my right hand hit the 
hole and my head hit the ceiling the ringer wrote 
i had no choice but to let go ending up with a bruised 
elbow black and blue hip and a little finger that blew up like a 
balloon 
two children surveyed by the doctors had teeth knocked out by 
wayward ropes an 80yearold ringer had a rope fall over his head 
tighten over his eyebrows and on the upward swing lacerated his 
forehead and scalp only a quick twist of the head prevented a 
fullscale scalping

pan am and twa two of the oldest and weakest 
airlines neared agreement on a business marriage that would end 
their longtime rivalry and change the cast of characters in a 
deeply troubled industry 
but pan am may have to seek bankruptcy protection anyway 
carl c icahn chairman of trans world airways had proposed a 
buyout of pan am corp last weekend in a deal worth about 375 
million pan am chairman thomas g plaskett responded with a letter 
friday saying the deal could be advantageous to our shareholders 
employees and other constituencies 
but in a frank admission of pan ams critical money shortage 
plaskett said pan am would need an infusion of cash before the 
purchase could be completed 
under the circumstances it would be futile to enter into a 
transaction without any provision for bridge financing especially 
if twa were not to commit to close the transaction regardless of 
our financial situation plaskett said 
icahn sent a letter to twas employees saying he had been 
considering the possibility of providing pan am with 
debtorinpossession financing this is a type of financing which 
might be possible if pan am decides to file a petition for 
reorganization in bankruptcy 
in an interview published in todays new york times icahn said 
of a bridge loan even though its going to be tough im going 
to make every effort i can 
combining twa and pan am would mark the end of independence for 
pan am which pioneered overseas air travel but has lost staggering 
amounts of money over the past decade it has survived by selling 
itself in pieces 
earlier this year it agreed to sell london routes and some other 
assets to united airlines for 400 million 
icahn had written to plaskett a letter dated sunday that offered 
to buy pan ams 150 million outstanding shares for 150 a share in 
cash and 1 a share in either preferred stock or notes 
in these extremely complicated and troubled times for the 
airline industry a combination of twa and pan am might offer both 
of us the opportunity to compete with the three major us 
airlines icahn wrote 
the industrys three dominant players are american united 
airlines and delta air lines 
friday was the deadline for pan am to accept 
in his responding letter plaskett asked icahn to send us 
promptly a detailed term sheet indicating among other things the 
basis on which you would be willing to provide bridge financing 
precisely what you envision as conditions of closing and the 
specific terms of the securities you are proposing to offer 
pan ams letter which didnt say how much cash was needed was 
released shortly after standard amp poors issued a statement raising 
the possibility that pan am would have to seek bankruptcy court 
refuge if it couldnt raise cash 
the airline industry is approaching record losses because of 
fuel inflation incited by the persian gulf crisis and slackening 
demand for air travel weak airlines such as pan am and twa are 
under the biggest strain 
icahns offer for pan am came at the same time he announced 
plans to sell all of twas london routes and some other assets to a 
healthier rival american airlines in a package worth 625 
million

for more than 25 years ed duncan has been 
hearing bells from tiny silver melody bells to the biggest a 
thunderous 22pounder he loves them all 
even the answering machine at duncans home has a message 
telling callers theyve reached the wesley bell ringers the 
nations largest handbell choir 
it all began in 1963 when duncans pastor at the christ united 
methodist church asked him to establish a group to give the 
congregations teenagers something to do 
one day i was idly thumbing through a catalog of church 
supplies and my eyes lit on this set of 25 bells you could buy 
said duncan who plays organ and piano and teaches high school 
physics 
i thought it seemed like something the kids could do right off 
the bat he said 
over the years the group has had as few as nine players to its 
current 30 the numbers changing because duncan never turns away a 
potential player 
that may be the thing im the most proud of anybody can play 
that wants to they dont have to be musicians he said 
duncan arranges nearly all of the music for the group and said 
its like scoring for three keyboard instruments and a percussion 
ensemble there are several octaves of bells and at least three 
sets are playing all the time 
each kid in the section has the same music then we assign 
them a certain number of bells and teach them where the notes are 
located on the staff he said 
whitegloved the bellringers perform in a complicated 
choreography that produces a rich sound sometimes reminiscent of a 
pipe organ 
spectacular one listener was heard to say at a recent 
performance 
the group has played in every state of the union including 
performances at the us capitol disneyland and disney world 
christmas programs are devoted mostly to carols but the choirs 
repertoire includes popular sacred and classical music 
last year the bell ringers were guests of the mormon tabernacle 
choir for a christmas performance and recently were chosen to 
perform at a convention of bell choir directors 
i really cant say with certainty but as nearly as i know 
its the biggest choir in sheer volume of bells and largest number 
of people so i keep saying its the biggest duncan said and 
the bell manufacturers say its true 
for the players the group has come to represent an important 
bond with other members of their faith 
because of the mormon churchs predominance in utah the groups 
teenagers someties are the only methodists in their school and 
the choir offers a comforting sense of community 
its nice knowing youre not the only methodist in town 
said may thomas 19 who has played with the group for two years 
every summer the group tours for five weeks fundraisers and 
proceeds from sales of their recordings help finance the trip 
linda gross a parent volunteer who handles publicity said the 
church has a fund set aside to pay duncan and help with the summer 
tours but he never takes the money 
he pays his assistant a little and uses the rest is used for 
scholarships to get everyone on tour she said 
jerry moore 18 a fouryear veteran said the ties run so deep 
between the players that he likens them to a big family 
this definitely brings friends closer he said you become 
lifelong friends

people in the neighborhood where five children 
were wounded by rivals in a driveby shooting shrugged off the new 
level of mayhem in the nations capital with shakes of the head and 
a whatcanyoudo look in their eyes 
thats the atmosphere around here said a 28yearold man 
who moved to suburban maryland five years ago but returned friday 
to visit his parents in the shaw neighborhood 
even the classmates of four of the victims the fifth was a 
6yearold girl seemed to take the thursday afternoon shootings 
in stride said a teacher at the imposing cinderblock shaw junior 
high school 
they look at it like its just the neighborhood said the 
teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity its another day at 
the office no big deal 
there was no rush of counselors into classrooms to calm the 
fears of students who must walk the same tough streets said the 
teacher who seemed surprised when asked how the school was 
reacting 
in fact he said the students generally did not even mention 
the shootings and no special effort was made to draw them out 
on friday three youths one age 16 and two age 14 were 
charged in the shootings and police said they were looking for two 
more 14yearold suspects meanwhile two of the victims including 
the 6yearold girl were released from childrens hospital the 
three others remained hospitalized 
some of those contacted in the neighborhood friday seemed as if 
they were beyond shock over violence in this city of 625000 
police say the city has had a record 471 homicides this year 30 of 
them juveniles in addition 1163 people have been wounded by 
gunfire 204 of them juveniles 
a 30yearold man who lives near the neighborhood said im 
very paranoid i think thats what keeps me alive 
yet he wouldnt think of moving to safer environs 
i love it too much he said its intriguing a constant 
mystery to be here and survive here its a challenge 
shaw less than two miles from the white house is one of the 
citys poorest neighborhoods but an economic upturn is expected 
next year when a subway station opens in the area 
today the area where the shootings occurred is a mixture of 
singlefamily row houses some with small but carefully manicured 
yards and christmas decorations houses subdivided into apartments 
and boardedup buildings a baseball field and a playground are 
nearby 
thursdays shootings resulted not from a random act of violence 
but from an altercation a week or so ago between two loosely 
organized groups of young people police chief isaac fulwood said 
i dont know whether it was drugrelated or not but i doubt 
it fulwood said angrily dont make everything drugrelated 
it cheapens the violence 
in the old days he said the dispute could have been settled 
with a simple fist fight he blamed the escalation on easy access 
to guns pervasive violence on television and a breakdown in 
parental inculcation of values in children 
the chief said he has spoken to young people about shootings and 
has found they show no remorse not the first tear theres no 
sense that theres anything wrong 
the attack about 3 pm thursday involved multiple gunshots by 
assailants in a car passing by the victims none of the weapons was 
immediately recovered fulwood said 
the names of those arrested were not released because of their 
ages and fulwood said no decision had been made on whether to try 
any as adults three were arraigned friday in juvenile court 
xaziver paul 6 and troy gray 15 were discharged from 
childrens hospital on friday spokeswoman barbara cire said brian 
lewis 12 was listed in good condition john olden 13 and 
clarence richmond 14 were upgraded from serious to fair 
condition

angered by slow progress in an investigation 
of the death of an american innkeeper the state department is 
suspending its 28 million military aid program to guatemala 
the action announced friday stemmed from the death june 8 of 
michael devine 49 originally of belleville ill who lived in 
guatemala for almost 20 years at the time of his death he was 
operating a hotelrestaurant in the northern part of the country 
devines body was found at the side of a road his head partly 
severed and his hands tied behind his back a private investigator 
reportedly has uncovered evidence pointing to involvement by a 
local guatemalan army unit 
we have concluded that it would not be appropriate to continue 
a normal military assistance relationship with guatemala at this 
time a state department statement said 
it noted that the guatemalan government rarely takes action to 
thoroughly investigate violators of human rights 
it also expressed deep disappointment with the lack of 
commitment of the government of guatemala to protect human 
rights 
as an example it cited the killing on dec 2 of 14 civilians in 
atitlan province and the wounding of 19 others two servicemen were 
arrested and are still in custody 
officials in guatemala city had little immediate comment on the 
announcement 
president vinicio cerezo told reporters only that the 
government will make known its position at the appropriate time 
guatemala refused us military aid in 1977 rather than accept 
the human rights conditions that were attached the assistance 
gradually resumed in the mid1980s 
as for the devine case state department officials said us 
diplomats pressed the guatemalan government over a period of months 
to complete the investigation before cerezo turns power over to an 
elected successor next month but they said the investigation is at 
a standstill 
the officials who requested anonymity said guatemalan 
authorities have not acted on two outstanding arrest warrants 
the authorities also have refused despite us requests to 
question the former zone commander at the military base near the 
area where devine was killed as well as the former head of 
intelligence at the base 
the us officials said they are not certain as to the motives 
for devines killing cerezo has acknowledged that the security 
forces could have been responsible for devines death

an extensive western review of the soviet 
economy maps a bold strategy for a break with 70 years of 
government control but whether mikhail gorbachev can carry out the 
reforms is very much an open question 
the study commissioned by the leaders of the united states and 
six other western powers called for soviet citizens already 
suffering from shortages of food and other basic goods to accept 
even more economic pain in the short term 
it prescribed such bitter economic medicine as the removal of 
price controls on basic commodities while at the same time imposing 
wage controls on workers 
the study prepared by the international monetary fund and three 
other western economic organizations conceded that unemployment 
would rise in the short term and economic output which is already 
plummeting would fall further as inefficient industries are phased 
out 
however it said only a coldturkey approach to reform similar 
to the methods being used in poland would work in the soviet 
union 
the imperative is to make sufficient progress at the beginning 
so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with the past and 
the process gains an unstoppable momentum the study said 
but western experts noted that even the warsaw government has 
had trouble selling its austerity program with poles expressing 
their unhappiness in recent national elections and gorbachev does 
not start with the same base of popular support that the solidarity 
movement had in poland 
indeed the soviet president is having to battle with 15 restive 
republics who are tired of the central government botching the 
countrys economy and want more freedom to try their own formulas 
still us analysts were optimistic the soviets eventually will 
be able to embark on the radical reform proposed by the study 
which was begun last july at the direction of president bush and 
the leaders of japan germany britain france italy and canada 
ed hewett a soviet specialist at the brookings institution a 
washingtonbased research organization said that while the odds 
were low that the proposed reforms could be implemented 
immediately he would not rule out the chances that such changes 
could take hold within the next year 
hewett suggested it may take a true coalition government 
spanning the political spectrum with strong representation from the 
republics to push such a measure through 
while it may seem difficult to see how such a program could be 
implemented now politics in the soviet union is moving very fast 
and six months is a long time in soviet politics he said 
the 50page report supported bushs contention that large 
amounts of direct western aid should not be provided to the soviets 
until they begin implementing more fundamental reforms of their 
economy 
in the short term the report said western countries should 
emphasize providing technical assistance to the soviets in such 
areas as banking law and transportation 
it also said that targeted aid to help the soviets with 
environmental problems and the modernization of their energy 
production system would be useful 
the general recommendations of the report are recommendations 
that the united states will support and subscribe to secretary 
of state james a baker said his comment indicated that the 
document is likely to form the blueprint for western assistance to 
the soviets in the next year 
the study was ordered at the houston summit in an effort to 
break a deadlock between french and german leaders who were pushing 
for an immediate 15 billion aid package and the reluctance of bush 
and others to go along with that proposal 
the study said that without the implementation of a major and 
farreaching reform program direct western aid would be of 
little or no lasting value but it held out the promise that once 
the reforms were implemented such aid would be forthcoming 
the report was prepared by the 154nation international monetary 
fund and its sister organization the world bank the organization 
for economic cooperation and development and the european bank for 
reconstruction and development

here in brief are the principal economic 
recommendations made friday by the international monetary fund and 
three other organizations in a report on reforming the soviet 
economy 
prices controls on prices must be removed quickly on many 
products in an effort to end shortages for certain key 
commodities the movement to market prices may need to be phased in 
over three years 
wages in order to insure that the initial spurt of prices does 
not trigger inflationary wage demands wages should be controlled 
in the early stages of price decontrol however the wage 
policy should provide a floor as well as a ceiling on employee 
wages 
money interest rates should be raised controls on bank credits 
to enterprises must be enforced and banks should have to hold a 
fraction of deposits as reserves on deposit with the central bank 
private ownership small firms should be privatized quickly 
through outright sales to infividuals cooperatives and others 
larger stateowned companies should have commercially oriented 
management with slower privatization perhaps through conversion of 
enterprises into joint stock companies owned by one of several 
state holding companies or owned through mutual funds 
social safety net policies are needed to deal with the rising 
unemployment that will occur as inefficient businesses are phased 
out and also provide protection for lowincome earners to 
compensate for the rising inflation once prices are decontrolled

an unannounced testfiring of an israeli 
missile sent american forces in the persian gulf area briefly 
scrambling into a heightened state of alert pentagon sources say 
the us action friday was a precaution against the possibility 
that israel might have been launching a preemptive strike against 
iraq said one source who like others spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
israel has been known to do preemptive strikes before the 
source said referring to israels 1981 bombing of an iraqi nuclear 
plant 
the 280000 us troops in the gulf area were put on heightened 
alert after us intelligence sources detected the israeli missile 
being fired and before it was clear the weapon was heading into the 
mediterranean the sources said the alert lasted only a short 
time they said 
israel feels threatened by iraqs increasingly sophisticated 
ballistic missile capability hich raises the possibility of a 
chemical weapons attack on israel especially if the usled 
multinational force in the gulf attacks iraq

safety experts are projecting between 380 and 480 
traffic deaths during the fourday christmas holiday 
the national safety council each year estimates the number of 
holiday traffic fatalities for the heavily traveled holiday period 
which began at 6 pm friday and ends 1159 pm tuesday 
last year 372 people died during the threeday christmas 
holiday 
this years projection is higher because christmas falls on a 
tuesday extending the holiday period another day council 
statistician terry miller said 
safety officials say the death toll could be lower than in 
previous fourday christmas periods because high gasoline prices 
may deter people from making long car trips or hopping from social 
event to event 
people may just decide to limit their driving to necessary 
errands going to the store and other things of that nature 
miller said but its hard to predict peoples behavior in such 
situations 
the council makes its projections by comparing the average 
number of traffic deaths each day this year with historical figures 
on traffic fatalities during past holiday seasons 
the council also projects that between 350 and 450 people will 
die during the fourday new year holiday period

nancy cruzans father and 
antieuthanasia demonstrators exchanged sympathetic words on the 
steps of a hospital where the braininjured woman lies dying 
meanwhile a federal judge friday criticized activists who want 
state health officials to restore a feeding tube removed from nancy 
cruzan last week 
the action was the latest in a series of petitions denied since 
food and water were withdrawn dec 14 from ms cruzan who has been 
in a persistent vegetative state for nearly eight years 
joe and joyce cruzan obtained court permission to have the tube 
removed after providing testimony that their daughter would not 
want to live in her present condition 
i guess im very concerned about you people being out here 
particularly the young people cruzan told about a dozen people 
bundled in parkas caps and mittens in 15degree weather the 
demonstrators have been holding a roundtheclock vigil 
cruzan came bearing a peace offering he gave a coffee maker to 
david hall of fort worth texas director of a righttolife group 
our prayers are with you hall said friday fighting back 
tears its a very tough time but we dont begin to think we 
could understand or go through what you have gone through were 
standing out here praying and doing all that we can do in a way 
that we feel god would have us do 
and we are doing the same said cruzan a 55yearold 
construction worker we are doing what we feel god has directed 
us to do and that is to carry out what we believe we believe we 
are in the best position to know what would be nancys wishes 
ms cruzan 33 has been in a vegetative state since a car crash 
nearly eight years ago doctors are convinced she will not recover 
she was expected to die within two weeks of the tube removal and 
was in deteriorating condition today 
demonstrators have pitched two tents on the lawn of the missouri 
rehabilitation center drawing power from the building for their 
heaters and coffee pots they planned to sleep there and in nearby 
cars despite a prediction of up to 5 inches of snow and minus30 
wind chill overnight 
nineteen people were arrested tuesday after they burst into the 
hospital and tried to reach ms cruzans room to reconnect her 
feeding tube five of the arrested demonstrators have been released 
on bond the others vow to remain in custody until she is fed or 
dies 
in the ruling issued friday in kansas city us district judge 
dean whipple criticized protesters for going from court to court 
seeking an order to restore the feeding tube 
this court is mindful of the fact that this is the fifth 
petition of its kind filed this week in various missouri courts 
the previous four petitions having been dismissed the ruling 
said 
in light of the history of this case this court finds that 
any further action would be frivolous at best and an abuse of the 
legal process the ruling said 
the judge had set a hearing friday on the petition filed by 
members of operation rescue a nationwide antiabortion group but 
whipple canceled the hearing and issued the written ruling instead 
court employees said the judge had been besieged by more than 
2000 phone calls by people asking him to intervene 
on friday morning the missouri supreme court denied a second 
request that it order ms cruzans feeding tube restored the high 
court and a missouri appeals court on thursday turned down similar 
requests

the governor acted after the ohio supreme court and the 
legislature established the syndrome as a defense against murder or 
other crimes that defense was not available at the time to the 
women celeste plans to free 
celeste who leaves office jan 14 included a stipulation that 
the released inmates must perform 200 hours of community service in 
domestic violence programs paperwork and other red tape probably 
will mean that the women will not be released until after 
christmas he said 
most of the inmates were convicted of serious crimes including 
murder manslaughter and assault 
in four of the 25 cases the women have served less than two 
years for the crimes they committed celeste stipulated that they 
must serve at least two years before their release 
celeste told a news conference that of the cases he reviewed 32 
were sent back to the state parole board for further review and 48 
were rejected 
he said about 15 other cases remained under review and that he 
would announce his decisions in those cases in january 
celeste said ohio became the last state to recognize the plight 
of battered women when the ohio supreme court in march ruled that 
evidence of battered woman syndrome is permissible at trials 
in those situations he said women face physical or 
psychological abuse frequently repeated and intensified 
resulting in feelings of guilt a sense of isolation and 
finally must submit to violence 
after the ohio supreme court ruling the state legislature 
enacted a law allowing evidence of battered woman syndrome to be 
used as a defense 
some of celestes decisions ran counter to recommendations of 
the parole board but he said he read each case at least twice and 
consulted with court and other officials before becoming convinced 
that they were victims 
celeste said the parole board does not cite what criteria it 
uses in its decisions

germanys state governors have decided not to 
limit immigration by jewish refugees from the soviet union who have 
been streaming into the old capital of the third reich in search of 
a home 
we are moved by the trust that the soviet jews are showing 
toward germany where horrible things happened to jews in the 
past gerhard schroeder the governor of lower saxony said after 
the decision in munich friday 
about 1000 soviet jewish refugees have arrived this month in 
berlin the first major german city along the rail lines from the 
east as many as 4000 soviet jews are believed to have arrived in 
germany this year 
officials reported a surge in the emigration of jews toward 
germany this week because of worries that th 16 governors meeting 
in munich might set a quota on the number of jews who could settle 
in germany 
another factor in the soviet emigration is fear that growing 
political tensions and economic hardships will lead to pogroms as 
has occurred in russias past vocal antisemitism is on the rise 
in the soviet union 
the governors decided not to establish any limits on jewish 
immigration under the current rules a soviet visa is practically 
all that jews need to move to germany 
bavaria spokesman wolfdieter remmele said the governors 
expressed their basic willingness to accept the soviet jews 
without any specific numbers being named 
by all means we will care for them schroeder said at a 
news conference in munich 
jewish leaders in germany have been urging a liberal acceptance 
policy citing the nations historical responsibility because of 
the nazi murder of 6 million jews 
under the current practice soviet jews arriving in berlin are 
guided to a counseling center where authorities after making sure 
they are jewish give them an orientation and house them at 
emergency shelters 
after temporary stays in berlin the jews are resettled in other 
parts of the country

for the first time in eight years arab 
nations let the general assembly recess its autumn session without 
making their annual effort to kick israel out of the un body 
the arabs apparently decided that challenging israeli membership 
would have complicated the delicate diplomatic arrangements related 
to the persian gulf crisis un officials said friday speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
at washingtons urging israel has refrained from direct 
involvement in the crisis while the united states accommodated its 
arab allies in the antiiraq alliance by supporting three security 
council resolutions critical of israel 
on thursday the un security council unanimously approved a 
referendum urging israel to halt deportation of palestinians from 
the occupied west bank and gaza it also calls on the united 
nations to monitor the safety of palestinians there 
the vote was sharply denounced by israeli officials and jewish 
organizations in the united states iraq and the palestine 
liberation organization said the resolution did not go far enough 
but it won the approval of egypt and syria two arab states that 
have troops in the usled multinational alliance pitted against 
iraq 
since 1982 arab nations have made an annual attempt to oust 
israel by challenging its right to sit in the general assembly 
among other peaceloving states 
this year the arabs had planned to introduce a motion that 
israels un credentials be accepted so long as the jewish state 
does not represent palestinian and other arab territories 
occupied by israel since 1967 
those areas according to the amendment include jerusalem the 
west bank the gaza strip and the golan heights 
but none of the arab delegations introduced the measure before 
the assembly recessed for the holiday un spokesman fred eckhard 
said 
israel captured arab east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 
arabisraeli war and has annexed it israel claims jerusalem as 
its capital and says it will never give the city up it has also 
occupied the west bank and gaza strip since 1967 
most countries reject israels claim on jerusalem pointing to a 
1948 general assembly plan that would have made jerusalem an 
international city and established two countries israel and 
palestine

lint hair and even part of a peanut 
were found clogging an air filter designed to help cool two 
computers that failed on the shuttle columbias last mission 
the clogged debris caused the two monitors to overheat forcing 
the space agency to control the shuttles 15 million astro space 
observatory primarily from the ground nasa spokeswoman patricia 
phillips said friday 
the debris appeared to be only partially responsible however 
phillips said engineers from kennedy and marshall space flight 
centers determined that some components in an electrical circuit 
had failed also 
within hours after the dec 2 launch astronauts smelled 
something hot and shut down the first computer and switched to a 
backup days later the telltale odor reappeared and the crew shut 
down the second computer 
the electronics are 7 to 9 years old and have a history of 
trouble phillips said marshall scientists had begun to redesign 
them even before their failure during the columbia mission

in a decision that may help unravel the 
mystery of hollywood studio financing a judge has ruled paramount 
pictures used an unconscionable formula to deny art buchwald 
royalties for the blockbuster film coming to america 
superior court judge harvey schneider said friday that buchwald 
a pulitzer prizewinning humor columnist and author and his 
producing partner deserve a fair share of the net profits from the 
eddie murphy film the judge ruled that the studio used an 
unconscionable formula for computing the net 
the judge had ruled earlier that buchwalds 1982 script 
treatment king for a day submitted to paramount formed the 
basis for coming to america 
paramount and murphy had denied there was any similarity and the 
studio refused to honor its agreement with buchwald and producer 
alain bernheim 
buchwald hailed the ruling against accounting practices by 
paramount as a christmas gift to hollywoods creative community 
while the studio denounced it as a blow to the free market system 
the studio also maintained the movie which grossed some 360 
million never produced any net profits 
the court concludes that the provisions of paramounts net 
profit formula are unconscionable schneider said in the 36page 
written decision 
he ordered a third phase of the trial to be held next year to 
determine the exact amount of damages due to buchwald and bernheim 
from paramount 
attorney pierce odonnell who represents buchwald and bernheim 
said he expects a multimillion dollar award in court papers 
buchwald and bernheim said they were entitled to royalties of up to 
146 million 
this may be the dawn of a new era of leveling the playing 
field in hollywood odonnell said 
an excited buchwald said from his washington dc home that he 
felt the judges decision would spur change 
they havent been challenged for a long time on how they keep 
their books buchwald said now theyre going to get a lot of 
lawsuits 
paramount lawyer charles diamond suggested the decision would 
have no impact on studio accounting and that the studio would 
prevail on appeal which has not yet been filed 
paramount issued a statement denouncing schneiders decision 
saying the decision is a threat to the free market system 
among paramounts financial practices singled out as unfair were 
excessive overhead and interest fees charged to film costs 
paramounts charge of a flat 15 percent for overhead yields 
huge profits even though the overhead charges do not even remotely 
correspond to the actual costs incurred by paramount the judge 
said 
diamond said schneider was trying to rewrite paramounts widely 
accepted policy it calls for the studio to recoup its costs for a 
movie plus another 75 percent of that figure before it begins 
sharing net profits with participants such as buchwald and 
bernheim 
under their contract buchwald and bernheim were entitled to up 
to 40 percent of the films net profits after a lengthy period of 
developing buchwalds idea into a script paramount abandoned the 
project in 1985 coming to america came out the following year 
buchwalds 1982 synopsis involved a young member of royalty from 
a mythical african kingdom who comes to the united states and is 
deposed in his absence he winds up in a washington ghetto working 
in a fast food restaurant where he meets and marries a young black 
woman 
in the murphy movie a prince from a mythical african kingdom 
comes to new york in search of a bride winds up in a ghetto 
working in a fast food restaurant meets a young black woman and 
marries her

the white house wants to cut an additional 
187 billion from medicare over the next five fiscal years 
according to documents obtained friday that included 27 
billion from the program in the next fiscal year in addition to the 
nearly 6 billion agreed to in the deficit reduction package in 
october 
the extra cuts would come from payments to physicians and 
hospitals in fiscal years 1992 through 1996 
the 500 billion deficitreduction package covered five fiscal 
years including the current one that began oct 1 and called for 
trimming 42 billion from medicare over the period 
medicare is spending about 110 billion this year to provide 
health insurance to 33 million elderly and disabled americans 
the proposal is outlined in documents drawn up by the white 
house office of management and budget in response to the department 
of health and human services fiscal 1992 budget request the 
associated press obtained a copy of the documents 
in february president bush will present his budget proposals to 
congress for the year that begins oct 1 1991 
teaching hospitals would take the largest hit in ombs 
passback plan in the next fiscal year payments to these 
hospitals would be cut 15 billion and over five years the toll 
would be 93 billion 
reimbursements to physicians would be trimmed by 250 million 
next fiscal year with congress choosing from among a list of 
options 
omb also said it wants 5 million to establish a clearing 
house that would keep track of employmentbased or other private 
health insurance this would help hhs enforce a law requiring that 
for a worker over 65 who is covered by health insurance through his 
or her employer the private insurance must be asked first to pay 
the claim 
in these cases medicare is the secondary payer but often 
patients dont disclose their private insurance and then medicare 
pays when it shouldnt 
under ombs proposal a line would be added to w2 forms 
requiring disclosure of health insurance coverage these forms are 
provided for every worker by their employer to the internal revenue 
service

president bush says house democrats are trying 
to renege on the budget agreement adopted last fall and he will 
veto any bill passed under a new house rule proposed by thedemocrats 
if provisions of the agreement are rescinded how can we 
expect the agreement to be taken seriously bush asked in a 
letter friday to house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
the issue is who estimates the dollar amount of certain 
spending and tax proposals the office of management and budget 
an arm of the white house or the congressional budget office a 
part of congress 
the budget agreement provided that omb would make the estimates 
but earlier this month the house democratic caucus voted 
overwhelmingly to back a house rule under which lawmakers would 
rely on estimates made by the congressional budget office 
the estimates must be made for proposed changes in socalled 
entitlement spending such as medicare or for tax changes 
entitlement spending amounts to roughly half the budget 
under the agreement anyone proposing a change in one of those 
areas must propose an offset either reduced spending in some 
other entitlement program or a tax increase 
the rule is to be considered on the first day of the new 
congressional session jan 3 
in order to preserve the integrity of the budget agreement i 
urge you to prevent the adoption of any rule that would violate our 
agreement bush wrote foley 
and in order to preserve confidence in that agreement i must 
advise you that i will veto any bill that contains language such as 
that specified in the rule approved by the democratic caucus he 
said

some peoples idea of yuletide fun is to watch 
the waiter bite the head off a live viper and pluck out the 
stillsquirming serpents bladder the slippery green organ is then 
eaten raw 
sure not everyone will cotton to that bitter flavor but they 
say snake enhances sexual prowess so whats not to like 
for one thing snakes may be threatened with extinction hong 
kongs government has declared 
on friday the government adopted a law that requires snake 
dealers to apply for import and export licences for king cobras 
asiatic cobras and oriental rat snakes failure to comply could 
bring fines of up to 3200 and up to six months in jail 
chan pingkwong spokesman for the agriculture and fisheries 
department said the government would collect data on snake imports 
to make sure the reptiles arent in danger of extinction 
more than 100000 snakes are imported by hong kong each year 
mostly from china chan said 
serpent eating is a feature of social life in the british 
colony especially during winter when the vipers are reportedly 
tastiest having gorged themselves to prepare for hibernation 
snake soup is a staple of business banquets this time of year 
and trade unions are organizing yearend snake feasts to kick off 
an election campaign for the legislature and other local offices 
next year 
the most common snake dish is a soup cooked with mushrooms 
bamboo shoots and dried orange peels the potion is reputed to 
speed the metabolism and improve male sexual performance 
another favorite snakes skin soaked in malt wine is believed 
to have calming effects similar to that of tranquilizers 
perhaps the most spectacular way of eating snake is swallowing 
raw bladders the dark green organ is extremely slippery and has an 
intensely bitter taste 
to show how fresh their product is hong kong vendors bite the 
snakes head off in front of customers who get to watch the body 
of the reptile wriggle through the vendors fingers as he searches 
for the organ 
the conservation organization world wide fund for nature said it 
supported the governments licensing decision 
if unrestricted trade continues snakes will one day become 
endangered said amy lau the funds conservation officer in hong 
kong 
snake trader tam sun who runs a small shop in downtown hong 
kong that sells snake soup said he has no choice but to pass on 
the cost of the new import license to his customers who now pay 2 
for a bowl 
our profit margin is already pretty narrow tam said after 
biting off the head of a green snake prices of snake soup will 
go up 30 percent

a federal judge dismissed weaponssmuggling 
charges against two europeans accused of trying to ship thousands 
of antitank missiles and other weapons to iraq iran and libya 
us district judge patricia fawsetts ruling friday after 
three weeks of government testimony closed a highprofile case 
that began in the wake of the iraqi invasion of kuwait in early 
august 
she agreed with defense attorneys that there was not enough 
evidence to prove intent or a conspiracy to smuggle the weapons 
prosecutors connected with the case were involved in 
grandstanding from the very beginning said defense attorney don 
lykkebak noting the arrests and indictment were ballyhooed in a 
washington news conference featuring tow missile props the 
problem was there was never any case 
claus fuhler 33 a germanborn ophthalmologist living in 
barcelona spain and juan martin pechekoesters 36 a madrid 
businessman were arrested aug 15 nearly two weeks after the 
iraqi invasion 
they were accused of trying to buy such items as 10000 tow 
missiles 20000 artillery shells artilleryequipped jeeps 
rifles grenades and mortars as well as nuclear waste and chemical 
garbage 
the two men were charged with violating the arms export control 
act which bans arms sales to the three countries 
us attorney robert genzman issued a statement saying that 
despite the dismissal of charges his office would not be deterred 
from prosecuting arms smugglers 
we accept the courts decision but we also want to stress the 
importance of pursuing arms traffickers who jeopardize our national 
security interests he said 
customs agents said the arrests culminated a yearlong sting 
codenamed operation dragon in which a us manufacturer of 
the tow missiles tipped authorities that fuhler and pechekoesters 
allegedly were seeking 10000 missiles for 160 million 
at the time of the arrests an undercover agent posing as an 
arms dealer said the men were trying to buy 200 tow missiles for 
shipment through spain to libya us customs service commissioner 
carol hallett had said the case was clearly linked to iraqs 
action in kuwait

a rented boat capsized in rough 
mediterranean waters early saturday while ferrying about 100 us 
sailors back from shore leave to the aircraft carrier uss saratoga 
police said 19 bodies were recovered 
before the latest police report an american official confirmed 
11 deaths and said nine men were still missing 
haifa police spokesman chaim avinoam said a total of 19 bodies 
were found after divers began searching the hull of the sunken 
ferry boat for victims 
police and american officials said saratoga commanders had begun 
a head count of the entire saratoga crew and that final fatality 
figures would not be available for several hours 
at least 33 sailors were taken to israeli hospitals for 
treatment an israeli doctor said police gunboats helicopters and 
rescue vessels which plucked 42 other seamen from the water and 
took them on to the saratoga continued scouring haifa bay before 
dawn 
the saratoga part of the us sixth fleet based in italy is 
stationed in the eastern mediterranean as a battle group included 
in the multinational force opposing iraq the carrier has a crew of 
about 6200 
according to sailors at the scene and a us official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity the boat was a privately rented israeli 
launch 
it was overloaded at the rear and because of the high seas 
water started coming over the stern said one young sailor who 
spoke on condition he not be identified once it started coming 
over it capsized very quickly 
kip burke commander sixth fleet staff based in gaeta italy 
said about 100 sailors were aboard the boat he said an 
investigation had begun into the accident but he was uncertain how 
far off shore the boat was when the 130 am incident occurred 
there is a lot of confusion burke said the biggest 
problem is counting heads 
an estimated 1650 american servicemen from the saratoga and at 
least three escort ships disembarked at haifa on friday for 
christmas leave a us spokesman said all the sailors aboard the 
capsized boat were from the saratoga officials said 
after the capsizing the port of haifa was declared a closed 
military zone and flares were seen illuminating the entire bay

in blue plastic bags some still were shivering hours after the 
accident drinking hot soup from plastic bowls 
benyishai said he knew of at least 10 other sailors taken to 
hospitals elsewhere in haifa a port frequented by us vessels in 
the region and about 75 miles northwest of jerusalem 
in washington lt col quentin banks a pentagon spokesman 
said identities of the dead sailors were not immediately released 
the saratoga is normally based at mayport naval air station in

aaaah chestnuts roasting in volcanic fires 48 
million years ago 
christmas didnt start in this part of the world but there is 
geologic evidence that many of its trappings existed in the pacific 
northwest during the eocene epoch 
chestnuts and forerunners of the traditional fir yule log were 
roasting in volcanic fires 48 million years ago in northcentral 
washington before there were noses for jack frost to nip 
we have the oldest fossil records of christmas trees the fir 
lineage the oldest records of mistletoe of holly and of castanea 
edible chestnut and the oldest fossil records of gooseberry 
wild currant apple blackberry and pear said wes wehr 
paleobotany curator at the university of washingtons burke museum 
and oh yes also the oldest fossil record of cranberry he 
said i guess what i need to do is find the fossil turkey and 
then were ready for dinner 
evidence of the precursors to some of todays plants including 
those used to celebrate christmas were found the past several 
years at fossil sites 100 miles apart in republic wash and 
princeton british columbia 
besides plants the republic site has been rich in insect finds 
wehr said friday 
besides other things were getting the only records of the 
north american eocene earwigs and we have the earliest fossil 
record of the cutter bee wehr said 
the plants and insects along with early fishes were preserved 
when a heavy layer of volcanic ash suddenly fell on a shallow lake 
that covered what is now republic a town of 1000 people 
the fossils have been gathered by wehr and other scientists from 
around the country at a shale cliff on the north side of republic 
he started digging at the shale rocks in 1977 after there had been 
occasional fossil finds the site with a small museum has gained 
status in paleontology circles 
its one of the great places in north america to see fish 
insects and plants all associated wehr said its been 
interesting to begin collecting a few specimens on what was a 
corner lot and have it become a place where scientists come from 
around the country 
some of the leading paleontologists from around the united 
states and from other nations are expected to attend a workshop 
at republic in june 
visitors including tourists are also given a tour of the 
stonerose interpretational center then encouraged to start 
breaking rocks 
many important scientific finds have been made by people who 
cant even spell paleontology wehr said 
often you will have a 9 or 10yearold student break open a 
rock and they have found a distinct new species wehr said it 
makes it all much more real

the accolades and selfcongratulation over the 
accomplishments of italys sixmonth presidency of the european 
community have faded to whispers 
now its back to business as usual for the italian government 
trying to avoid collapse many are predicting that premier guilio 
andreottis fiveparty coalition may survive only a few more weeks 
with the uneasy alliance between the dominant christian 
democrats and socialists nearing the breaking point the parties 
have scheduled a series of meetings for january to decide whether 
italys 49th postwar government can be salvaged 
the country is also embroiled in a furor over president 
francesco cossiga the head of state who is supposed to be above 
the daily trench warfare between political parties some 
politicians are demanding he resign for having defended a secret 
cold war guerrilla force 
there had been a tacit accord among italys fractious political 
parties to refrain from provoking a government crisis during the 
countrys highprofile term at the helm of the ec from july 
through december 
only two months ago italys leadership had been the target of 
scorn and ridicule in some ec circles especially in britain the 
economist magazine compared the italian presidency to a bus trip 
with the marx brothers in the drivers seat 
but the italians claim to have gotten the last laugh 
first at an ec summit in rome in october they pushed through 
plans for monetary union that isolated british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and led to her downfall 
last week italy steered the community through a landmark summit 
that approved emergency aid for the soviet union and formally 
launched the 12nation trading bloc on an ambitious path toward 
political and economic federation 
andreotti has sent the bus driven by the marx brothers back to 
westminster turins la stampa newspaper headlined monday 
with the ec leadership about to be passed to luxembourg 
andreotti may find it harder to keep his own government partners on 
course he has been in office since july 1989 a feat of longevity 
in a country where governments often last only a few months 
the 71yearold christian democrat and sixtime premier has 
skillfully managed to avoid a complete rupture in the fragile 
alliance with socialists social democrats republicans and 
liberals 
but the strains have grown in recent days as usual the 
squabbling is part of a power struggle in which the christian 
democrats socialists and opposition communists play the major 
roles 
the socialists led by former premier bettino craxi are italys 
third largest party and represent the christian democrats key ally 
in keeping the communists out of the government 
the socialists are demanding that referendums be held to revamp 
the countrys electoral system and allow direct election of the 
president 
the eventual aim of the socialists analysts say is a strong 
presidency on the lines of the us or french models with craxi as 
a candidate for the job the presidency is now mainly a ceremonial 
post 
the christian democrats prefer to strengthen the role of 
parliament where they can more easily maintain their dominance 
francesco donofrio a christian democrat parliamentarian says 
there is an 80 percent chance the government will collapse in 
january and a good likelihood of general elections in the spring a 
year ahead of schedule 
but the government might feel compelled to stay together if war 
breaks out in the persian gulf donofrio said italy has sent 
warships and fighter planes to the multinational force opposing 
iraq 
another element of the political crisis is the controversy over 
operation gladio a clandestine force created in the 1950s to wage 
guerrilla war in the event of a warsaw pact invasion gladios 
existence was disclosed in october by andreotti with other nato 
countries later confirming they had similar networks 
cossiga a christian democrat has vigorously defended gladio as 
a legitimate force necessary to counter communist threats to 
western europe during the cold war 
his statements raised the ire of some politicians mainly the 
communists who say gladio was linked with rightwing terrorism and 
targeted italian communists

the past year was the safest on record for the 
army and navy military officials said 
private vehicle accidents remained the biggest killer of 
soldiers and sailors 
accidents claimed the lives of 353 soldiers during the budget 
year ended sept 30 the army said the figure includes mishaps 
that occurred offbase and offduty 
the time period included the first rush of troops to the persian 
gulf 
more than twothirds of the deaths were from private automobile 
accidents in the comparable period a year earlier the army had 
369 accidental deaths 
there were 732000 army personnel on active duty at the end of 
accounting period 
total army accidents were down by 1348 from the previous year 
to 8647 and deaths from aviation accidents fell from 35 to 33 
col steven raho deputy director of army safety attributed the 
safety improvement to a variety of factors including increased 
effort by the army to design safety features into new equipment 
rather than adding the features after production 
the navy which had 579000 personnel on active duty at the end 
of the budget year said it recorded 255 total deaths from 
accidents including 206 not related to navy operations that was 
down from 339 total navy deaths the year before of which 47 
occurred in the april 19 1989 explosion aboard the battleship uss 
iowa 
twothirds of total navy accidental deaths were from private 
vehicle wrecks 
the navy had 39 deaths from aviation accidents including those 
involving marine corps aircraft the navy total of 30 deaths from 
aviation was the lowest on record as was the marine corps total of 
nine 
the marines do not publish lists of accidents from ground 
activities and the air force said it was not yet prepared to 
release its statistics on fiscal 1990 accidents and deaths

americans could get their first chance to see 
television coverage of federal judges at work next year 
the experiment will likely begin in appeals courts in new york 
or san francisco or a trial court in one of six states court 
officials said friday 
the courts have been selected now its a matter of the news 
media requesting coverage in particular cases said david 
sellers a spokesman for the policymaking us judicial conference 
the conference composed of 27 federal judges and headed by 
chief justice william h rehnquist approved the threeyear 
experiment last september individual courts then were invited to 
volunteer 
those selected are federal appellate courts based in san 
francisco and new york city and us district courts in indiana 
massachusetts michigan new york pennsylvania and washington 
a final report submitted friday to the judicial conference by a 
special committee said the selection of large courts would bring 
more judges into the program and their location in metropolitan 
news markets would likely generate greater media activity 
beginning in july broadcast and photographic access will be 
allowed in civil cases in the selected courts judges will have 
broad discretion to reject requests for coverage 
cameras and radio equipment have been banned from federal courts 
since 1937 but 45 states allow some form of broadcast or 
photographic coverage of proceedings in their courts

what started as a battle over dress and 
hair length has turned into a fullscale student rebellion 
in the past month thousands of high school students have taken 
to the streets in protest occupied schools and won support from 
university students who have begun their own demonstrations 
the uprising is hampering the 8monthold conservative 
administrations ability to govern greece and represents the new 
democracy partys first serious challenge prime minister 
constantine mitsotakis and his cabinet held more than four 
emergency meetings in a week on the problem 
greece is not alone in france this fall thousands of high 
school students also held demonstrations demanding improved schools 
and safety 
more than 50000 high school and university students marched 
through the capital dec 18 calling for the resignation of 
education minister vasillis kontoyannopoulos 
they also demand the scrapping of a newly proposed educational 
reform package which include provisions for punishment for sloppy 
appearance or improper behavior 
high school students say the legislation is vague about 
discipline and does not explain the grading system they also want 
more government money for education 
the demonstrators chanted our dreams will become your 
nightmares and the law will never be passed as they waved 
clenched fists at parliament in central constitution square 
the continuation of these mobilizations is not only harmful 
but dangerous the government has proven it is understanding but 
these actions just make things worse kontoyannopoulos said 
high school students have taken over more than 2000 schools 
around greece or 67 percent of the total since late november 
university students began sympathy strikes at their own campuses in 
middecember 
the high school students were protesting a series of 
presidential decrees this year that allow teachers to give penalty 
points to rule breakers the rules included a phrase that said 
students must maintain a tidy and smart appearance 
enough points could lead to lower grades or transfer to another 
school students complained the decrees did not define proper dress 
and behavior but left the decision to teachers 
the decrees were introduced as a stopgap measure until the 
government could introduce its reform package in presenting the 
package the government withdrew the decrees and control system 
but retained other proposals that angered the students 
the university protest is aimed at a proposal that would allow 
the establishment of private universities currently banned by the 
constitution 
it degrades our education and degrees if students want to 
attend private universities they should go abroad said a 
student who requested anonymity 
the government has already taken tough stands to quench protests 
against economic austerity measures a law labor restricting 
strikes and an antiterrorism law that exercises prior restraint on 
press coverage of terrorist attacks 
it is the philosophy of no concessions they are trying to 
preserve their image of being decisive and uncompromising said 
former socialist education minister george papandreou son of 
former prime minister andreas papandreou 
his fathers panhellenic socialist movement or pasok ruled 
greece from 1981 until andreas papandreou was voted out of office 
in june 1989 coalition governments ran greece until the 
conservatives were elected last april 
students are also upset that the government allowed riot police 
to use clubs and tear gas to disperse a previous demonstration 
we began taking over our schools because we have various 
problems with the laws they are trying to force on us said 
michalis a 17yearold student who attends athens public high 
school no 1 the oldest in greece and the alma matter of many 
politicians and academics 
the neoclassical building nestled near the base of the ancient 
acropolis has been closed since dec 10 nervous students talk to 
visitors through a broken window the front door is chained shut 
kontoyannopoulos stated aim has to bring the school system in 
line with the ethics and goals of orthodox christian greek society 
more than 97 percent of greeces population is baptized into the 
church 
he said the socialists allowed the educational system to become 
undisciplined and politically biased

political philosopher michael oakeshott whose 
stress on personal responsibility and freedom was said by some to 
have laid the foundations for margaret thatchers social policies 
died at age 89 his family said today 
oakeshott died tuesday at his home at acton in southwest 
england no cause of death was given 
the son of a prominent socialist oakeshott was educated at 
cambridge universitys gonville and caius college 
in 1951 when he became university professor of political 
science at london universitys london school of economics his 
conservative ideas were a sharp contrast with socialist harold 
laski whom he replaced 
oakeshott held the post until 1969 when he was made professor 
emeritus at the university of london 
oakeshott was credited with turning conservative opinion away 
from social planning and back to personal responsibility and 
freedom 
the times of london wrote in an obituary notice today more 
than anybody else michael oakeshott articulated the real 
philosophical foundations of mrs thatchers policies yet he had 
no direct influence on her and she was disposed to consider him 
irrelevant for her purposes because unlike hayek he made no 
practical recommendations 
mrs thatcher claimed that her philosophy of individual 
selfreliance was influenced by the austrian economist friedrich 
hayek and his 1944 book the road to serfdom a critical study 
of socialistic trends in britain 
oakeshott once said in an interview i am a member of no 
political party i vote if i have to vote for the party which is 
likely to do the least harm to that extent i am a tory 
he always insisted political theory offered no guidance in 
political practice and that his work was intended only as a 
contribution to scholarship 
oakeshotts books included experience and its modes 
published in 1933 social and political doctrines of contemporary 
europe hobbess leviathan rationalism in politics and 
other essays on human conduct and the voice of liberal 
learning which came out just last year 
a guide to the classics which oakeshott wrote with a 
colleague in 1936 dealt not with famous books but with picking 
winners at the racetracks which he frequented 
oakeshott is survived by his wife and a son by a previous 
marriage

a judge has refused to assist 
prosecutors seeking to extradite marlon brandos daughter from 
tahiti to testify at her halfbrothers murder trial 
superior court judge joel rudof said friday he declined to get

there is insufficient information to permit this court to 
further endanger what appears to be a fragile mental condition and 
attempt to have miss brando returned rudof wrote

will be reevaluating the case without her testimony said sandi

witness 20yearold cheyenne has helped slow proceedings she

federal prosecutors defended seizing 
pictures from a prominent photographer saying they were 
undoubtedly within the definition of child pornography and 
included one of him having sex with a minor 
the government filed papers friday opposing jock sturges 
request for a court order requiring return of thousands of 
photographs and other property that officers seized from his san 
francisco home last april 
the papers said the seizures were justified by evidence from a 
photo lab that child pornography would be found at the home 
prosecutors also said officers acted properly in entering the home 
without a warrant because of concern that sturges might destroy 
evidence or harm himself 
much of the material already has been returned but some 
photographs will not be returned because they plainly are 
lascivious and are therefore contraband said assistant us 
attorney floy dawson in the court papers 
dawson told a reporter however that his office is not yet 
ready to file criminal charges against sturges 
sturges whose nude portraits many of them of children are 
displayed in major galleries across the nation said police seized 
100000 photo negatives along with personal files and equipment 
during the raid his lawyer said the search was illegal and the 
property must be returned a hearing is scheduled jan 4 
the governments papers friday included statements by a police 
inspector and an fbi agent declaring the photos at a san francisco 
laboratory and sturges home included pictures that prominently 
displayed the genitals of underage girls 
dawson appeared to acknowledge sturges claim that the fbi had 
been calling families he had photographed around the world and 
telling them he was accused of being a child pornographer and a 
pedophile 
this can hardly be surprising in light of the evidence 
dawson wrote mr sturges had in his possession hundreds of 
photographs of prepubescent girls that vividly focus on the 
genitals correspondence indicating his own sexual relationships 
with minor girls and photographs of himself engaged in sexual 
contact with a 15yearold girl

a former ballerina who lost the use of her legs 
in a car crash seven years ago thanked jurors for their 143 
million damage award but said no amount of money could make up for 
what she has gone through 
a state supreme court jury set the award friday for shenikwa 
dawn nowlin 31 who was paralyzed from the waist down when a car 
she was riding in went out of control on new york citys west side 
highway in august 1983 and crashed into a wall 
former new york yankee infielder andre robertson who was 
driving testified that a warning sign was placed too close to a 
sharp curve and he didnt have time to slow down 
nobody can be compensated for the kinds of injuries i 
received nowlin said outside the courtroom after thanking 
jurors if i had it to do over again id be walking and not 
sitting here no money can pay for what has happened to me 
nowlin who is now a lawyer was the dance theatre of harlems 
youngest member when she was 14 
jurors ruled that new york city was 67 percent liable for 
nowlins injuries because the sign didnt provide sufficient 
warning they ruled robertson was 33 percent liable for exceeding 
the highways 40 mph speed limit 
nowlin and robertson testified the car was traveling 60 to 65 
mph when the crash occurred but a witness said it appeared to be 
going 80 mph 
the jury did not find nowlin negligent for not wearing a seat 
belt 
robertsons attorney daniel mcnamara said his clients 
insurance would cover about 25000 of the award but because 
robertson is not wealthy the city would have to pay most of the 
award he said city officials could try to recover some of the 
money from robertson later 
it was not immediately known if robertson or the city would 
appeal 
robertson 33 retired from baseball last year and now works at 
a steam generating plant in texas

a widebodied passenger jet landed on the wrong 
runway at logan airport in july but the federal aviation 
administration had no record of the mistake a newspaper reported 
today 
faa officials have records of only seven of 20 runway 
incursions at logan reported to the national aeronautics and 
space administration during the first eight months of the year 
according to the boston globe 
barry bermingham faa special projects manager for the new 
england region said an exhaustive search is under way to 
determine why the agency was not aware of the july incident 
he said it was possible the controller who handled the flight 
decided the landing error did not create a safety hazard so no 
report was filed 
the incident was reported by the flight crew of the unidentified 
commercial airliner to nasas aviation safety reporting system 
nasa gives those who file reports anonymity and immunity from 
penalties for possible wrongdoing 
the system is designed to create a large data base of potential 
safety problems so aviation officials can correct problems 
the report states the plane was cleared to land at logan in 
cloudy weather with visibility of 15 miles 
the pilot was using computers and an automatic pilot to approach 
the designated runway but he landed the plane manually because the 
computer did not capture the glide slope which is needed for an 
instrument landing 
the pilot said he had no idea he had landed on the wrong runway 
until afterward no one was injured

lech walesa the electrician who led a 
workers movement that deposed communist rulers to begin sweeping 
changes in eastern europe was sworn in today as polands first 
popularly elected president 
the 47yearold labor activist elected earlier this month by a 
landslide assumed the countrys highest office at an inauguration 
ceremony before both houses of parliament 
he took power 10 years after he led the shipyard strike that 
created solidarity the east blocs first independent trade union 
one year ago he put together polands first noncommunist 
government and democratic revolutions against other 
sovietinfluenced communist regimes swept across eastern europe in 
the weeks afterward 
i solemnly swear to the polish people that i will be faithful 
to constitutional decisions i will protect the dignity of the 
nation the sovereignty and security of the state i swear so 
help me god walesa said in a firm clear voice his wife danuta 
stood at his side as the oath was administered by parliament 
speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz 
the evil era when the authorities of our country were 
appointed under pressure of foreigners or as the result of forced 
compromises is ending walesa told the parliament immediately 
after his oath 
he pledged poland would become an element of the peaceful 
order in europe but said poles would have to believe in 
themselves to revitalize economic life 
passivity and apathy these are the biggest obstacles on the 
road toward the wellbeing of poles he said 
walesa elected dec 9 had refused to accept the post from the 
incumbent president communist gen wojciech jaruzelski who was 
this nations last communist leader jaruzelski was not invited to 
the ceremony 
jaruzelski jailed walesa and other solidarity leaders during the 
martial law crackdown in 1981 
legitimacy was to be conferred later in the day by ryszard 
kaczorowski president of the anticommunist governmentinexile in 
london that descends directly from the warsaw government forced to 
flee from the nazis in 1939 during the postwar decades of 
communist rule the governmentinexile nourished hopes of 
returning home 
kaczorowski returning for the first time was to give walesa an 
insignia of office and other prewar symbols of power in the 
ceremony at the royal castle where polands first democratic 
constitution was written in 1791 
walesa was also to accept the blessing of the roman catholic 
church with a mass to be celebrated in honor of his presidency by 
the cardinal jozef glemp polands roman catholic leader 
in statements since his election walesa declared his presidency 
would mark the culmination of the struggle to throw off foreign 
domination 
honoring the dozens of baltic coast workers gunned down 20 years 
ago during antigovernment strikes over bread and meat prices 
walesa said sunday that as president he would strive to realize 
the last will of those who died 
free poland has existed more in literature and song than in 
reality for the past two centuries 
since 1795 poland has enjoyed only 21 years of independence 
from rule by foreign powers principally germany and russia even 
that interlude between the world wars was darkened by a coup and 
strongman rule 
walesas critics fear he will be another strongman in the 
tradition of marshal jozef pilsudski who after a 1926 military 
takeover allowed the trappings of democracy but pulled the strings 
as military commander 
walesa must assemble a government that maintains dramatic 
marketoriented economic reform that won the confidence of the 
west while responding to discontent voters showed by 
overwhelmingly rejecting prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis 
presidential bid 
walesa has pledged to complete the radical freemarket reform of 
the economy but the program has already boosted unemployment and 
sent prices soaring 
walesa won his office with 75 percent of the vote after fending 
off a dark horse challenge by unknown emigre businessman stanislaw 
tyminski branded by walesa as a frontman for a 
counterrevolution by former communists 
the bitter election campaign also split the solidarity movement 
leaving walesa alienated from mazowiecki and most of his other 
former intellectual advisers 
as president walesas first task will be to nominate a prime 
minister to run the government on a daytoday basis while 
preparing for elections that would replace the parliament elected 
under a 1989 bargain that guaranteed 65 percent of seats for 
communists or their allies 
walesa announced thursday that he was unable to name a prime 
minister until after the christmas and new year holidays he said 
he is wavering between two options 
one would be to keep a modified version of mazowieckis current 
caretaker cabinet for about three months until fully democratic 
parliament elections in the spring the other would create an all 
new cabinet that would be given a year to work before elections

cambodias vietnamesebacked government and three 
guerrilla factions were under increased pressure to accept a un 
peace plan as talks resumed today 
cambodian prime minister hun sen who fell ill during the first 
day of talks friday was expected to rejoin the meeting of the 
12member supreme national council the talks were to conclude 
later today 
french foreign minister roland dumas addressing fridays 
opening session warned that time was running out to reach a 
settlement and urged acceptance of the plan that would give the 
united nations a strong role in an interim government 
the world has changed other priorities can and will require 
our attention dumas said the international community cannot 
indefinitely work out the fate of cambodia if cambodians themselves 
do not have the political will to do so 
he told a news conference that fridays talks had been 
constructive saying the factions asked questions but did not 
reject the plan outright 
britain one of the authors of the plan also has pressed for 
acceptance it sent an envoy to paris to discuss normalizing 
relations with the phnom penh government on condition it accepts 
the peace process 
david colvin director of the british foreign offices southeast 
asian department said he told hun sens delegation that accepting 
the plan could lead to normalizing relations with the west but 
rejecting it would mean further isolation 
all factions agreed to a version of the plan in september but 
phnom penh has since balked saying the proposal exceeds the 
authority of the un charter 
the plan calls for the united nations to administer cambodia 
during an interim period leading to free elections it also calls 
for a ceasefire and disarming of all four parties 
phnom penh is concerned about the extent to which its government 
could be dismantled by the plan and about the extent of 
disarmament said a senior western official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
hun sen said on his arrival here that serious measures must be 
taken to suppress the foundations of the chinesebacked khmer 
rouge the strongest member of the threeparty resistance 
coalition 
their threeyear reign of terror which ended in 1979 with a 
vietnamese invasion left hundreds of thousands of cambodians dead 
the council meeting for the second time since its creation 
three months ago is made up of six representatives of hun sens 
vietnamesebacked government and two from each of the three 
resistance factions 
dumas said the peace plan agreed to nov 26 by the five 
permanent members of the un security council was a compromise 
text that could be improved but not put into question the 
permanent members are the united states the soviet union britain 
france and china 
the international conference on peace in cambodia adjourned in 
september 1989 after a monthlong effort failed to reach a 
settlement

the kgb chief warned today that the soviet union 
must be ready to accept bloodshed in exchange for order and accused 
the cia and other foreign elements of stirring up trouble in the 
soviet union 
later today parliament ended debate on constitutional 
amendments enhancing the powers of president mikhail s gorbachev 
and the official news agency tass reported that most lawmakers 
would support the proposals 
in his 25minute speech to the congress of peoples deputies 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov said outside forces are trying to 
exert overt and covert pressure on the soviet union and to impose 
doubtful ideas and plans to pull the country out of its difficult 
situation 
the cia is gathering information on workers movements in the 
soviet union for its purposeful masterminding and funding 
antisoviet formations like radio stations that attack the 
soviet union he said 
kryuchkov did not say what kind of ideas he thought foreigners 
were trying to impose on the soviets he asked the 2250member 
parliament to give his agency more power to fight corruption and 
nationalist uprisings 
we will not avoid more serious consequences if we dont start 
immediately to fight destruction of our forces kryuchkov said 
we should be ready to accept bloodshed if we want to speak about 
bringing order to the country 
the speech similar to one kryuchkov gave earlier this month 
came as president mikhail s gorbachev struggles to maintain 
control over independenceminded republics simmering ethnic 
conflicts and a collapsing economy food shortages have hit moscow 
leningrad and other large cities prompting western countries to 
send emergency food 
fears of political turmoil were heightened with the surprise 
resignation thursday of foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
shevardnadze blamed reactionaries for moving the soviet union 
toward dictatorship and urged reformers to unite to preserve 
democratic changes 
the proposed constitutional amendments debated by the lawmakers 
would transform the soviet system of executive power into a 
presidential form of administration gorbachev wants more power to 
hold the country together and fight corruption while he carries out 
economic reform 
most legislators support the idea of strengthening 
presidential powers tass said 
opposition legislators belonging to the interregional group 
however said gorbachevs powers should be dependent on the 
approval of the supreme soviet legislature 
anatoly lukyanov chairman of the supreme soviet told the 
congress in a 20minute speech that the deputies should approve the 
amendments without reservation if parliament trusts the 
president it should untie his hands and not hold him on a rope of 
parliamentary debate lukyanov said 
he said preliminary voting on the amendments will begin monday 
kryuchkov said the kgb needs more authority to combat economic 
sabotage and nationalist militancy in the republics 
nationalists have assembled 26000 armed fighters in the soviet 
republics of estonia latvia armenia and georgia he said 
all 15 soviet republics have declared sovereignty in some form 
from the kremlin georgia lithuania estonia and lativa have 
declared outright independence 
in saying the country should be prepared for bloodshed 
kryuchkov referred to ethnic violence in some republics and asked 
isnt there bloodshed already 
boris yeltsin the reformist president of the russian 
federation dismissed kryuchkovs speech as old news 
yes there is sabotage yes there is corruption he said 
we have heard all this before 
a representative of the lithuanian government attending but not 
participating in the congress accused kryuchkov of using scare 
tactics that have failed before 
if he is speaking about bloodshed then it will be him who 
causes it said algis cekoulis 
hardline communists have urged gorbachev to impose a state of 
emergency in republics ridden by ethnic conflict and separatist 
movements gorbachev has said he might do that if the congress 
allows him to strengthen his hand in dealing with trouble spots 
kryuchkov also said he opposed private property laws that would 
let land fall into the hands of the black market and shady 
enterprises 
shevardnadzes unexpected resignation thursday pleased 
hardliners who opposed his role in negotiating the unification of 
germany and soviets role in the antiiraq coalition 
reformers have used his speech as a rallying cry a parade of 
speakers at the congress on friday echoed the 62yearold 
diplomats warning that hardliners were pushing the country toward 
a dictatorship 
gorbachev met friday for two hours with shevardnadze reportedly 
to discuss some way of keeping his longtime ally in the government 
it wasnt clear whether gorbachev intended to ask shevardnadze 
to continue as foreign minister or to take another post a 
shevardnadze aide said on thursday that the resignation was 
irreversible

defense secretary dick cheney told 
desertweary marines today he did not expect president bush to wait 
long past jan 15 to send them to war against iraq if saddam 
hussein leaves his army in kuwait 
cheney did not say how long he meant by soon but said he and 
bush were against forgetting the un deadline and instead giving 
economic sanctions more time to exact a toll on baghdad 
the president is deadly serious when he says the whole crisis 
cannot be resolved until saddam hussein goes back to baghdad and 
withdraws his forces from kuwait cheney told members of the 1st 
battalion 7th marines most of whom have been in saudi arabia 
since midaugust 
i would think that soon after jan 15th if he has not 
withdrawn his forces from kuwait well be in a position to take 
military action in conjunction with our allies cheney said while 
standing atop an m60a1 tank in the desert some 50 miles from the 
kuwaiti border the marines might be asked to cross 
cheney in response to a marines question praised other arab 
nations for their support of the military effort particularly 
egypt where he is to stop sunday to meet with president hosni 
mubarak before returning to washington 
cheney brought christmas greetings to the troops from bush and 
the american people but added a somber note telling them they 
might soon find themselves at war or treating its casualties 
as the secretary visited marines in the desert and then flew by 
helicopter to a navy hospital ship and aegis cruiser in the persian 
gulf gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was 
making a separate round of troop visits as well 
just how soon american troops will be ready to fight is a 
question that became controversial this week when the deputy 
commander of operation desert shield said ground forces might not 
be combat ready until well into february 
those comments were widely interpreted as weakening the bush 
administrations effort to link the threat of attack to the un 
deadline 
cheney today refused to comment on the remarks made wednesday 
by army lt gen calvin ah waller but his tough talk the past 
two days appeared to be part of an effort to convince saddam 
ignoring the deadline carried a heavy risk 
bush who was meeting with british prime minister john major at 
the presidential retreat at camp david md rejected suggestions 
that troops in the persian gulf are not battle ready 
if there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now the 
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously bush said when 
asked today about wallers comments 
bush reiterated his determination to soon expel iraq from kuwait 
in a magazine interview released friday 
it cant drag on with indecision and it cant stop short of 
the un mandate bush told us news amp world report see that 
argues very forcefully against some of these scenarios that call 
for somebody to compromise well give him something for this give 
him something so he saves face that is not in the books 
national security adviser brent scowcroft meantime told 
reporters for the associated press and other news agencies that 
jan 15 was purely an authorization date and not an attack 
day at all 
the un resolution doesnt say saddam is going to be 
attacked this date or that date or whatever the national 
security adviser said adding one of the important points were 
trying to get across to him is that we havent blinked so far 
were not blinking now and we will not blink 
cheney and powell during earlier visits on friday drew applause 
from the troops when they promised if war erupts to wage a 
violent and destructive campaign 
the only acceptable outcome if hostilities begin is 
absolute total victory cheney declared 
powell said he hoped no bloodshed would occur but if war comes 
he said when we launch it we will launch it violently we will 
launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get it over 
as quickly as possible and theres no question who won 
it was the second straight day of tough talk from pentagon 
leaders who appeared to be trying mightily to offset speculation 
that the us troops will not be in position to fight on jan 15 
cheney in his pep talk to the troops appeared to be trying to 
dispel the notion that wallers comments removed any military 
threat from the deadline 
asked by an airman how long the united states would wait to 
attack if the deadline passed without an iraqi withdrawal cheney 
said 
while i cant tell you a specific date for obvious reasons 
when that would happen i can say that we are eager to get this 
wrapped up as quickly as possible we do not think that waiting 
indefinitely is going to solve the problem and im confident well 
move as soon as we can to wrap it up 
he also promised that washington would not interfere with 
strategic decisions of field commanders 
there will be the freedom and flexibility to run a firstclass 
military operation all the way cheney said to applause they 
wont have their hands tied behind their backs there wont be 
sanctuaries where the enemy can take cover

a ferry capsized and sank in rough 
mediterranean waters early today while taking about 100 american 
sailors from christmas shore leave back to the aircraft carrier uss 
saratoga at least 19 drowned 
american and israeli rescue teams searched throughout the night 
for others feared missing after the israeli ferry tuvia went under 
shortly after midnight in windy choppy seas about 200 yards from 
the saratoga the us ship was about a mile off the coast 
fortyseven sailors were hospitalized and 38 rescued unharmed 
from the choppy seas according to stateowned israel radio it 
said four were in serious condition and most of the others had been 
released later in the morning 
it was the deadliest accident involving american servicemen 
taking part in the usled multinational force arrayed against 
iraq and raised the number of americans killed in operation desert 
shield to at least 73 
the sailors were among hundreds who spent their holiday liberty 
friday in haifa some with wives and girlfriends who had flown from 
home to meet them 
the saratoga has a crew of about 4500 
a haifa police spokesman chaim avinoam said 19 bodies had been 
recovered by midmorning army spokesman ranaan gissen said six of 
the bodies were found trapped in the twodeck 57foot ferry about 
80 feet below the surface of the mediterranean 
officials said at midafternoon that two other sailors still 
could be missing saratoga commanders recalled all 1920 men from 
shore leave 
there was no official report on the cause of the sinking 
witnesses said they believed there were too many people in the back 
of the ferry 
shaul raziel director of the israel port authority said a 
combination of events probably caused the accident the seating 
or movement in one direction a sudden wave and the disaster 
happened he said on army radio 
survivors said from beds at haifas rambam hospital that the 
navychartered ferry had taken on water in high seas then suddenly 
overturned as it was hit by two large waves 
it felt like we were going against the waves so we would go 
up and come down and everytime we would come back down water 
would come in said seaman michael benjamin 19 of san antonio 
we were going on the waves and i just noticed one that was 
bigger than normal and then we noticed another one that was bigger 
than normal the next thing i know all i saw coming in was water 
i was tilted forward i heard a lot of yelling shes going 
down 
benjamin suffered a neck injury when he was hit in the water by 
one of the rescue boats 
in the next bed chief petty officer lance vickery 33 of 
mayport fla said the tuvia sank almost instantly 
all of a sudden i saw water just come flying in it was maybe 
two seconds and the boat rolled right over said vickery who 
suffered bleeding lungs from inhaling water 
the port of haifa was declared a closed military zone after the 
accident and flares illuminated the bay dotted with search ships 
helicopters and us and israeli frogmen searching the sunken 
ferry 
there was confusion over the number of casualties because some 
sailors aboard a nearby ferryboat the carmelite jumped into the 
water to help rescue their colleagues said us embassy spokesman 
don cofman 
some of the carmelite passengers later were pulled from the 
water by rescuers leading to uncertainty as to how many of the 
about 100 sailors aboard the illfated tuvia were accounted for 
the captain of the sunken boat who gave his name only as yossi 
told reporters he believed the ferry sank because too many people 
were gathered in the stern 
there were squalls all day and the waves were three to four 
feet tom abbott of the us embassys naval attaches office 
said at a news conference 
abbott said he talked to one person aboard the other ferry who 
said the tuvia went down almost instantly he turned his back 
turned around again and the ferry was gone it went down very 
fast said abbott 
cofman said it was believed all those aboard the sunken ferry 
were from the saratoga but a few could have been from the escort 
vessels 
the saratoga is part of a task force has been anchored outside 
the breakwater off the northern port of haifa since thursday night 
the saratoga is accompanied by the destroyer sampson cruiser 
south carolina and combat stores ship sirius said cofman 
officials said the naval task force carries 6200 men 
the saratoga is normally based at mayport naval air station in 
jacksonville fla but has been in the mideast since the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
one american sailor told israel army radio he thought the ferry 
tuvia was swamped because it had too many people for too small a 
boat it couldnt hold the weight and it just sank 
but a crewman reached by telephone at the haogen boat company 
offices said the boat was licensed to carry 131 people and had 102 
aboard 
he said the haogen company had worked with the navy ferrying 
sailors ashore since haifa first began being used as a liberty port 
about 20 years ago

soviet troops goosestepped away from a memorial 
to victims of world war ii for the last tme saturday as they 
handed over control of an enclave in western berlin to civilians 
several hundred people watched a soviet honor guard escort the 
final twoman watch away from the large memorial in tiergarten the 
sprawling park just west of the brandenburg gate which used to 
mark the division of east and west berlin 
soviet officers and berlin legislators laid wreaths before the 
memorial and bands played the national anthems of the soviet union 
and germany 
the mayor of the tiergarten borough wolfgang naujokat said 
civilian police would guard the monument and it would be kept as it 
is including the two old soviet tanks and two artillery pieces 
that were part of the red armys advance into berlin in 1945 as 
nazi germany fell to the allies 
after the berlin wall was built in 1961 the monument became an 
odd soviet enclave 500 yards inside west berlin where the guards 
had to be relieved by convoy 
the end of the soviet guardpost at the memorial was a provision 
of the sovietgerman treaty of friendship and cooperation signed

defense secretary dick cheney hopped 
atop a tank saturday to tell desertweary but eager marines war 
likely would come soon after jan 15 if saddam hussein ignores an 
ultimatum to withdraw from kuwait 
cheney did not say whether he meant days a week or longer but 
he said he and president bush would not forget that united nations 
deadline in favor of giving sanctions against iraq more time to 
work 
with the press here i cant get too specific about dates but 
obviously we want to get it over with as soon as possible cheney 
said while standing on an m60a1 tank in the saudi desert about 50 
miles south of kuwait 
still cheney on his second day of prechristmas visits with 
some of the nearly 300000 american troops in the region did 
escalate the predeadline rhetorical war by saying 
the president is deadly serious when he says the whole crisis 
cannot be resolved until saddam hussein goes back to baghdad and 
withdraws his forces from kuwait i would think that soon after 
jan 15th if he has not withdrawn his forces from kuwait then we 
will be in a position to take military action in conjunction with 
our allies 
as cheney was visiting the marines in the desert and then navy 
personnel aboard a hospital ship and aegis missile crusier in the 
persian gulf chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin 
powell was making separate visits to troops as well 
cheney and powell have been in saudi arabia since wednesday 
meeting with senior and field commanders to assess the readiness of 
the american forces less than a month from the un deadline 
the trip was thrown into controversy the first day when the 
deputy commander of operation desert shield lt gen calvin ah 
waller told reporters us ground forces might not be combat ready 
until midfebruary it was his opinion that bush should put any 
attack plans on the shelf until the entire deployment still 
awaiting the arrival of more than 100000 army ground forces was 
ready 
cheney and powell refused throughout the week to comment on 
wallers remarks but their hawkish pep talks to troops appeared 
designed to convince saddam in case waller made him think 
otherwise that the deadline still carried a military threat 
we will be ready whenever the president says go to do 
whatever has to be done cheney told sailors aboard the uss 
bunker hill after seeing a demonstration of its guns and firing a 
dozen rounds into the gulf himself were ready today if we have 
to do something obviously 
bush meanwhile said that us forces are battle ready 
if there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now the 
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously bush said from 
camp david md 
cheney told the marines who have been in the desert since 
august when the american deployment was just beginning that they 
now had plenty of help 
weve got enormous forces deployed here in saudi arabia and 
were prepared to use them cheney said 
cheney appeared to have the remarks of the armys waller in mind 
when a marine asked him about the readiness dispute and said many 
homesick marines prefer to go to war and get it over with 
said cheney we always knew the marines were going to be ready 
before the army was 
and again later when a navy sailor asked about reports american 
forces were not ready to fight cheney said the army may be a 
little slow but we know the navys ready 
but one of the marine units senior officers brig gen tom 
draude said he concurred with wallers assessment 
i dont think you should initiate something as serious as 
combat until you have got everything you possibly can draude 
said 
cheney watched the marines practice tankkilling by light 
infantry donning chemical protective suits and decontaminating 
tanks and other armored vehicles 
he promised them that if saddam used chemical weapons our 
response will be absolutely overwhelming 
after a helicopter trip over the gulf and past several vital 
saudi oil installations being defended by american forces cheney 
toured the usns mercy one of two hospital ships send to the 
mideast before finishing his day with a stop on the bunker hill

army lt gen calvin ah waller plopped himself into the center 
of a major controversy last week when he said american ground 
troops in saudi arabia probably wont be combat ready until 
midfebruary 
thats a month after the un deadline for saddam hussein to 
pull his army from kuwait and wallers message ran counter to the 
toughtalking approach the bush administration was taking in trying 
to convince saddam hed best meet the un ultimatum 
wallers comments might make him appear a dove trying to find 
an excuse to avoid combat he wanted to make sure reporters knew 
otherwise so he ended his candid interview session by passing 
around a copy of a favorite passage 
from john stuart mill it reads 
war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the 
decayed and degraded state which thinks nothing is worth war is 
much worse a man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight 
nothing he cares more about than his personal safety is a 
miserable creature who has no chance of being free

first came questions about whether the united states was ready 
to attack iraq then another about the depth of arab support for 
the antiiraq coalition 
the next marine to ask defense secretary dick cheney a question 
had something else in mind 
who do you think is going to be in the super bowl this year 
sir the lance corporal asked 
cheney quickly entered his home team the washington redskins 
his second choice was the san francisco 49ers but cheney 
quickly realized he couldnt stick with it both the redskins and 
the 49ers are in the national football conference so only one could 
make the super bowl 
so he threw the question to the crowd 
buffalo was the first shout cheney nodded in approval 
houston came from the back of crowd 
ever the politician cheney decided to stay out of the debate 
shrugging his shoulders and moving on to the next question

iraq called off the second half of a civil 
defense drill on saturday and local newspapers said officials 
planned an exercise to evacuate the entire capital at a later date 
officials had planned to evacuate the citys western half which 
has 2 million residents in a drill similar to one held on friday 
no explanation for the delay was given 
however friday is the moslem holiday so government offices and 
schools were closed anyway a drill on saturday would have meant a 
shutdown 
interior minister samir mouhamad abdulwahab said the results of 
fridays exercise were encouraging 
in that drill hundreds of thousands of residents from east of 
the tigris river were transported by private automobiles and buses 
to locations north east and south of the city for several hours 
we are proud of the results of the drill and we are confident 
that more drills will be held the army daily alqaddissiya 
quoted abdulwahab as saying 
the interior minister who is also head of the main civil 
defense committee said blackout drills would be held in baghdad 
and other cities no dates for those or for the evacuation of the 
entire capital were given 
the civil defense commitee was set up a few weeks ago to prepare 
the poulation for a possible war 
the un security council has authorized the use of all 
necessary means to dislodge iraq from kuwait if it does not 
withdraw from the emirate by jan 15

president bush contradicting a top 
military commander said saturday allied forces in the persian gulf 
are prepared to deal vigorously with any iraqi provocation on a 
moments notice 
bush sought to put to rest comments by lt gen calvin ah 
waller the deputy commander of allied forces in the gulf that the 
troops will not be battle ready by the jan 15 un deadline for 
the withdrawal of iraq from kuwait 
if there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now the 
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously bush said 
bush spoke to reporters at his windwhipped fogshrouded 
mountaintop retreat where british prime minister john major was his 
overnight guest 
bushs statement was backed up in saudi arabia where defense 
secretary dick cheney told marines they can expect to go to war 
soon after jan 15 if iraqi president saddam hussein refuses to 
leave kuwait 
i would think that soon after jan 15th if he has not 
withdrawn his forces from kuwait well be in a position to take 
military action in conjunction with our allies cheney said while 
standing atop an m60a1 tank in the desert some 50 miles from the 
kuwaiti border 
major who accompanied bush to the news conference left the 
clear impression that british policy is no less aligned with the 
us stand in the gulf than it was under former prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
if there is going to be a conflict in kuwait thats really a 
matter for saddam hussein major said he knows what the 
security council resolutions say they couldnt be clearer 
whats hes done is unforgivable 
speaking later to reporters at andrews air force base before his 
departure major said he and bush were entirely of one mind on 
the gulf crisis if saddam refuses to withdraw we are ready to 
use force to free kuwait and restore the legitimate government 
as further evidence that all is well in the britishamerican 
connection in the postthatcher era bush and major began 
addressing each other as john and george shortly after 
their talks got under way on friday 
bush said the american and british positions are totally 
together under questioning bush also said the soviet union has 
given every indication that its support for us policies in 
the gulf will continue notwithstanding the resignation of foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
major agreed adding our clear hope is that the expressed 
direction of soviet foreign policy and internal political and 
economic reform will continue unchanged 
shortly after waller made his remarks about the lack of military 
preparedness in the gulf the administration began looking for ways 
to soften their impact 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said waller really meant 
that the forces were not as ready as they would like to be for 
all contingencies 
secretary of state james a baker iii suggested wallers remarks 
were aimed at keeping the iraqis guessing 
when i was in the marine corps one of the important 
principles of warfare that i learned was that it was critical to 
preserve the element of surprise baker said 
bush seemed mystified that saddam has yet to budge despite the 
massive array of firepower deployed near his borders 
i am convinced that saddam hussein hasnt gotten the message 
yet for some odd reason a message that all of us are determined 
to fulfill to the letter all of the united nations resolutions 
bush said 
he added that he expected to hear more about the preparedness 
levels of the allied forces on monday from cheney and chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff colin powell upon their return from a 
tour of us forces in saudi arabia 
besides the gulf bush and major discussed the impact of the 
shevardnadzes resignation the nato alliance in the postcold war 
era and efforts to revive the global trade talks which collapsed 
two weeks ago 
major said they discussed the remarkable changes going on in 
south africa i told the president and secretary baker about the 
european communitys decision to lift its investment ban and 
expressed the hope that the united states will soon feel able to 
lift some of the restrictive measures that they have in place

the us education department last week placed 
new limits on minority college scholarships invoking civil rights 
law the department ruled that aid financed from a colleges own 
funds must be colorblind 
yet two months earlier in a far more liberal reading of those 
same statutes a regional office of the education department could 
find nothing wrong with harvard universitys giving admissions 
preference to offspring of alumni 
both rulings by the same federal agency expose an old truth 
about college admissions and scholarships laws and lofty 
principles may be invoked one day to support a desired social end 
only to be abandoned to suit another occasion 
confusion reigned last week over guidelines on racebased 
college scholarships colleges and civil rights groups generally 
reacted angrily to the bush administrations new rules forbidding 
the spending of institutional scholarship money to redress racial 
imbalances on campuses 
the ruling issued by the departments assistant secretary of 
civil rights michael l williams gave colleges and universities 
four years to comply with the new guidelines on minority 
scholarships 
nearly everyone including bush predicted a long struggle ahead 
in congress and the courts 
but over the years colleges and civil rights advocates have 
proven no more consistent in their principles than the government 
when it comes to promoting campus diversity or creating a level 
playing field in granting admissions and financial aid 
until the early 1960s colleges commonly used racial and ethnic 
quotas and perverted the financial aid process to limit the numbers 
of blacks jews and other minorities 
yale university bushs alma mater was among the most zealous 
of the ivy league institutions in using quotas and aid denials to 
keep their campus white christian and wealthy according to a 1985 
study joining the club by dan a oren 
last week many of the very colleges that had long used quotas 
and scholarships to exclude minority students were now invoking 
their right to establish goals for increasing the campus 
presence of blacks and others and to use racebased scholarships 
toward that end 
according to the college board 696 colleges and universities 
offered grants and scholarships based entirely on a students 
minority status in the 199091 school year 
the longsimmering dispute over the fairness of the scholastic 
aptitude test to minority students displays similar ephemeral 
patterns 
the sat was first used in 1926 when exclusionary quotas were 
the rule the idea was to create an objective measure to test the 
academic mettle of the collegebound to move at last toward an 
admissions process that was blind to all but a students merit 
yet civil rights and womens groups call the exam biased they 
claim that this test originally devised to open campus doors to 
the underprivileged is slamming them shut 
and those same civil rights groups that once yearned for a level 
playing field for minority applicants now can be heard demanding 
special advantages 
college admissions and scholarship policies have always been 
full of inconsistencies biases and illogic most admissions 
officials agree thats unavoidable after all students are being 
evaluated not machines 
and the admissions process aims to achieve many goals at once 
an academically capable student body yes but also a diverse one 
that includes blacks whites hispanics some superbrains some 
athletes perhaps a cellist or two 
the goal of ethnic and racial diversity doesnt always mesh 
perfectly with fairness in the awarding of scholarships and 
thats where disputes like last weeks arise 
the latest debate began because an assistant education secretary 
ingenuously tried to lend an element of consistency to the awarding 
of scholarships by applying a strict constructionist interpretation 
of civil rights law 
but history suggests that such efforts to tidy up this 
inherently sloppy business of scholarships arent necessarily 
welcomed or needed 
equals

every child wants christmas to come more than 
once a year in the holy land it does 
more than 40 denominations are represented in israel and they 
will mark christmas on three dates dec 25 jan 7 and jan 19 
with rituals that include bonfires processions and chanting in 
aramaic and coptic 
such diversity also brings discord rival christian groups 
jealously guard their rights to the church of the nativity in 
bethlehem built in the 4th century over the grotto where tradition 
says jesus was born 
the rivalry led to pitched battles and injuries in past 
centuriesand in past decades to fist fights between priests the 
latest argument among clerics concerns which sect has the right to 
repair the churchs leaky roof 
daniel rossing an israeli expert on christian affairs said the 
squabbling should be seen in the context of christians fading to a 
minority in the holy land over the centuries 
when youve lost so much in terms of numbers and power you 
become very protective of what you have left he said 
what we have here is a microcosm of the christian world it 
may look divided but we must not forget the vast richness of the 
many faces of christian tradition here 
at no time is the richness more visible than during the 
christmas season marked in the holy land more by religious fervor 
than by the shopping fever of the west 
western rite churches will celebrate christs birth dec 25 and 
most eastern rite sects on jan 7 in jerusalem the eastern or 
orthodox churches stick to the julian calendar accounting for the 
13day difference from the western christmas on the gregorian 
calendar 
armenian orthodox also use julian calendar but will celebrate 
christs birth on the epiphany or 12th day of christmas jan 19 
the diversity of christianity is revealed in the many 
denominations represented in the holy land 
there are chaldeans a catholic sect with origins in the persian 
gulf the copts from ancient egypt and the maronites an eastern 
sect based in lebanon with a patriarch recognized by the pope 
others include greek orthodox syrian orthodox roman catholic 
armenian franciscan lutheran baptist anglican presbyterian 
pentecostal mormon and ethiopian orthodox 
each sect has its own christmas customs 
syrian catholics pray and sing around a bonfire outside their 
st josephs church in bethlehem on dec 24 
it reminds us of the shepherds who huddled around a fire on 
this night and it also symbolizes the light of christ said 
monsignor buttros abdel ahad the vicargeneral 
anglicans sing carols in shepherds field at beit sahour near 
bethlehem on dec 24 before midnight services at christmas dinner 
of lamb and apple pie the next day a family leaves an empty seat 
at the table for a wandering stranger 
at st johns church in jerusalem the franciscan midnight mass 
on dec 24 centers on a reproduction of a manger built every year 
by brother claudio barrato complete with moving figures and 
lights 
sometimes things go wrong and i have to crawl inside and 
adjust it the 70yearold monk said with a smile the real 
thing is the mass the devotion the manger is just something to 
help the heart 
on jan 18 the armenian christmas eve the armenian patriarch 
enters bethlehem in a black limousine led by four policemen on 
horseback an honor guard given all patriarchs since ottoman 
turkish rule 
various sects used to hold elaborate candlelight processions 
with bagpipes and boy scout troops but the pomp was dropped after 
the palestinian uprising began in december 1987 
most christians in bethlehem are palestinians and bethlehem is 
in the occupied west bank many say they cannot celebrate 
elaborately while fellow palestinians are being killed or wounded 
in confrontations with israeli troops 
they still hold masses on christmas eve however 
the roman catholic ceremony is most widely known in the west 
because its traditional choir concert often is shown on television 
abroad 
on jan 6 there is another kind of concert the greek orthodox 
syrian orthodox and copts all hold services simultaneously in 
various parts of the church of the nativity their chants in greek 
aramaic coptic and arabic competing vigorously in volume 
a 19th century code spells out each sects rights in the church 
but frequent fights have broken out among the greeks armenians and 
franciscans the sects that act as custodians of the church 
confrontations often occur on the traditional church cleaning 
day betweem the western and eastern christmases since rights to 
clean parts of the shrine can imply ownership 
in one case some priests entitled to clean the upper part of a 
church wall had to use 12footlong brooms because of an argument 
over leaning a ladder against the lower part washed by another 
group 
some past disputes were more involved 
in 1847 a silver star disappeared from the church grotto where 
it marked the site of christs birth five years of negotiations 
involving french diplomats and the turks who then ruled palestine 
were needed to reach an agreement on replacing it

dont ask macys dont ask hasbro dont even 
ask santa claus and dont make any promises to the children go 
go my walking pup is sold out 
without the furor that accompanied the great cabbage patch kid 
shortage the 40 walking dog has became the hot impossibletoget 
toy of the christmas season 
it is a product that is impossible to find theres not enough 
of them said thomas r kully a toy industry analyst for william 
blair amp co of chicago 
nobody knows that better than hasbro industries the pawtucket 
ri company that markets the 18inch batteryoperated white 
maltese on a leash 
go go has run out if there are a handful across the country 
id be surprised said wayne charness a company spokesman 
he said about 300 people a day call the headquarters in search 
of the dog 
they are told that it will be january or february before the 
company has more go gos which are made in china 
its very flattering when a product of yours takes off but on 
the other hand its frustrating because we cant meet the need 
charness said 
he would not say how many of the dogs were sold but kully 
estimated sales at between 15 million and 20 million compared 
with the 500 million in sales that teenage mutant ninja turtle 
figures should do 
in most parts of the country it has been difficult to find the 
dog since november lines formed early outside a lionel kiddie city 
toys store in new york when a late shipment of the dogs arrived 
about a week ago they were sold out as quickly as the purchases 
could be rung up on the cash register 
we had lines in other stores in 16 other states said joel 
h weiner a spokesman for lionel leisure inc the parent company 
of lionel kiddie city toys and lionel playworld 
still he said go go has not caused the kind of stir that the 
cabbage patch kids made in 1983 
the dolls which are now also marketed by hasbro received a 
rush of media attention early in their first holiday shopping 
season when they became hard to find the go go dog shortage has 
gone relatively unnoticed except by parents trying to find the 
toy 
a spot check of about 20 stores in the new york and northern new 
jersey area found that none had the dog and all knew about the 
shortage 
karen kraus a saleswoman in macys toy department said the 
store gets dozens of calls a day asking about the pup 
of all the new toy products the hottest is go go i guess 
because it does something it walks she said its cute 
stores placed orders in june for the dog which sells for about 
40 it reached the shelves by august and a commercial featuring a 
young girl walking the dog made it high on the list of toys wanted 
by girls 
hasbro pulled the advertising two weeks before christmas 
its unusual charness said you dont see products that 
are as incredibly hot as this one is the toy industry is a fashion 
industry i dont think you can ever really predict what is going 
to be the hot product going in 
he suggested parents stuff their childrens stockings with ious 
there will be plenty of go gos next year he promised

president bush rejecting suggestions 
that the allied forces in the persian gulf are still not battle 
ready said today any provocation by the iraqis would trigger a 
vigorous response at a moments notice 
at the same time bush expressed confidence that the soviet 
union will continue to be aligned with us policy in the gulf 
despite the resignation of foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
with british prime minister john major at his side bush spoke 
to reporters on the helipad at his windwhipped fogshrouded 
mountaintop retreat here 
bush was asked about the comments wednesday of lt gen calvin 
ah waller who said in saudi arabia his troops will not be ready 
for combat by the jan 15 united nations deadline for iraq to 
withdraw its forces fom kuwait 
if there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now the 
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously bush said 
when asked about the impact of shevardnadzes resignation bush 
said there is every indication there will be no change in 
soviet policy toward the gulf 
major reaffirmed his strong support for us policy in the gulf 
much as he did on friday in private talks here with bush and in a 
series of television interviews 
speaking to reporters at andrews air force base shortly before 
departing for home major said he and bush were entirely of one 
mind on the gulf crisis if saddam refuses to withdraw we are 
ready to use force to free kuwait and restore the legitimate 
government 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that bush 
and the recently installed major are in full agreement on almost 
every point on the gulf situation he did not say where the two 
disagree 
they agree on the need to implement the united nations 
resolutions on the gulf and that partial solutions are 
unacceptable fitzwater said 
he added that the leaders also expect that soviet support for 
the us position on the gulf will continue notwithstanding the 
resignation of foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on thursday 
they had a very friendly trip they are on a firstname 
basis fitzwater said 
besides the gulf they discussed the impact of the 
shevardnadzes resignation the nato alliance in the postcold war 
era and efforts to revive the global trade talks which collapsed 
two weeks ago 
the bush administration was distressed when former prime 
minister margaret thatcher stepped down three weeks ago but major 
has moved quickly to ensure a policy of continuity particularly on 
the gulf question 
consistent with the us view on the gulf major on friday 
rejected the notion that efforts should be made to lure iraqs 
saddam hussein out of kuwait through the offer of concessions 
there is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about major said 
saddam has to go he said 
secretary of state james a baker iii echoed that sentiment 
after meeting with major at the state department 
nobody that i know of is willing to negotiate backwards from 
the un security council resolutions baker said we simply 
cannot appease aggression if we really believe that theres an 
opportunity for a new world order we cant start out by appeasing 
aggression

with top kremlin officials speaking last week of 
the dangers of dictatorship and bloodshed world leaders wondered 
whether the soviets would stumble on their way out of the cold war 
era 
the stunning resignation of foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on thursday was the strongest signal yet that the 
reforms that he and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev began 
nearly six years ago have run off the rails 
dictatorship is coming shevardnadze warned from the 
congress podium as gorbachev and nearly 1900 parliamentarians 
listened in shock 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov warned it would be necessary to 
accept bloodshed if we want to speak about bringing order to the 
country 
the streets of moscow were calm the sky crisp and blue the 
temperature well below freezing snow lay on the ground and 
families prepared as best they could to welcome the new years 
holiday 
but tempers were flaring in the long lines that formed outside 
nearly empty stores some spoke darkly of fleeing the country until 
the approaching storm blows over 
military patrols were checking citizens documents in the port 
city of klaipeda in the secessionist republic of lithuania in the 
north in the southern republic of georgia shevardnadzes native 
land the newly elected noncommunist government announced plans to 
form its own militia under the republics interior ministry 
violence here revolutionary or repressive is almost impossible 
to control once unleashed as it has been so many times in the 
soviet union in this century and so often in russia and its 
empire over the past millennium 
the soviet union has lost an estimated 40 million people to war 
famine and terror since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 they know 
suffering and fear it as much as they fear a return to the past 
shevardnadzes emotional speech thrust those fears firmly into 
the center of soviet political debate 
he criticized neither gorbachev nor the soviet leaders 
proposals to further strengthen the powers of the presidency a 
step that other reformers have warned could lead to a return to 
dictatorship 
but gorbachev was angered by the speech which he said caught 
him by surprise he said he had planned to appoint shevardnadze to 
the post of vice president to be created under his proposal to 
forge a fully empowered presidency 
gorbachevs public acknowledgement that he was planning to 
remove shevardnadze from the foreign ministry confirmed fears 
expressed by some reformers that foreign policy would fall into 
the hands of yevgeny primakov 
primakov despite his apparent loyalty to gorbachev does not 
carry shevardnadzes mantle as architect of the end of the cold 
war 
since the iraqi occupation of kuwait last august gorbachev has 
dispatched primakov on diplomatic shuttle missions that were 
designed to avoid the use of us military force in the persian 
gulf 
primakovs meetings with iraqi leader saddam hussein were viewed 
by some soviet and western observers an effort to balance 
shevardnadzes clear alliance with the us administration on gulf 
policy 
that alliance offended many soviet conservatives who objected 
to abandoning a longtime antiimperialist ally iraq and to 
any use of soviet armed force in the persian gulf particularly in 
league with washington 
the military conservatives are led at least in public by two 
colonels who are members of the congress viktor alksnis and 
nikolai petrushenko shevarnadze alluded to them in his resignation 
speech 
the colonels practically crowed with delight as shevardnadze 
resigned 
but the reformist newspaper komsomolskaya pravda lamented that 
now the american versions of alksnis and petrushenko have 
received evidence that they were right in warning that the 
kremlin could not divorce the past so easily 
the maneuvering over foreign policy vital to the outside world 
paled in comparison to the titanic struggles being waged over the 
future of soviet domestic policy the very structure and shape of 
the nation 
although shevardnadze did not criticize gorbachev or his efforts 
to strengthen the presidency he clearly intended his speech as a 
rallying cry to what he called the scattered forces of reform 
other reformers took up where shevardnadze left off 
reactionaries centralists and imperialists have united and 
are on the attack ukrainian delegate vladimir chernyak told the 
congress friday 
at the head of the coup stands gorbachev its possible he 
himself doesnt know it said chernyak by demanding for 
himself more and more powers he is creating the legal basis for a 
dictatorship maybe not for himself personally

tens of thousands of national guardsmen called to duty in the 
persian gulf are being temporarily replaced in some states by 
volunteers whose duties include watching over vacant armories and 
assisting in natural disasters 
usually called the state guard or the state defense force 
groups totaling nearly 10000 such volunteers mostly retired 
soldiers and sailors exist in 24 states and puerto rico 
were sort of a hasbeen force until were needed said tom 
anderson president of the national association of state defense 
forces 
most have been relatively inactive in recent years but persian 
gulf callups have expanded the role of these purely stateoperated 
organizations said anderson commander of the new mexico state 
defense force 
we have people from all walks of life i would say that our 
membership is pretty much split between veterans as well as young 
people having no military service whatsoever said commander 
robert haas of the 750member ohio military reserve 
none of the organizations has federal status although the 
national guard bureau in washington dc assists the states in 
coordinating their activities 
the governors can call up the state units to help with disasters 
and other activities usually handled by activated guard units 
size duties and history of the units vary widely 
texas has a 1300member state guard and units in tennessee and 
georgia number about 1000 rhode islands state defense force 
created in 1987 numbers just three and vermonts 8yearold state 
guard consists of 12 retired military officers 
the 400member indiana guard reserve last summer provided relief 
and assisted in the cleanup of southern indiana hit by devastating 
storms 
last year the virginia defense force helped with crowd control 
at 17 events around the state it has done search and rescue 
missions and is helping a small town develop a plan to handle toxic 
chemical spills 
some of the units such as alaskas were formed at statehood 
others were authorized by state constitutions and some formed 
during world war i in mississippi the state guard operated under 
an attorney generals opinion until the legislature put it into the 
law in 1989 
many units have deep roots in us history new mexicos militia 
traces its beginnings to an organization know as los vecinos 
the neighbors dating back to 1606 when the spanish explored the 
rio grande valley georgias state defense force traces its 
heritage to a colonial militia organized in the massachusetts bay 
colony in 1636 
in michigan the recruitment of military retirees begins in 
earnest next month the michigan emergency volunteers is 
reemerging after having florished during the two world wars 
before being disbanded in 1946 
weve had it before said retired brig gen warren 
lawrence who will oversee the organization its something that 
really should be in place at least in skeletal fashion to activate 
on a needs basis 
much of the state guards work right now is voluntary none has 
been called to duty by executive orders of governors in few 
states if activated by the governor state units would get the 
same pay as national guardsmen 
right now were watching over about 55 national guard 
armories across the state said maj gen roy h swayer jr with 
the mississippi state guard our volunteers have gone into these 
armories as custodians to keep up with what is going on 
members of the tennessee defense force are repairing doors 
helping with finances and generally cheering spouses of mobilized 
national guard troops 
weve gotten an enormous amount of volunteer work going on 
with people assisting units that have mobilized lawyers helping 
draw up wills helping with family support groups things like 
that said brig gen frank pointer 
tom hegele a member of the north carolina state defense 
militia said the groups are volunteers in every sense of the word 
at a time like this there are people out there who wish there 
was something they could do to help said hegele who works for a 
state agency 
this might not be much but for some people it is a way they 
can contribute he said were telling people who might have 
aged out of active service or the guard to look us over and see if 
theyre interested

merrie merrie englande is once again planning its 
traditional christmas dinners largely unaware that the long shadow 
of 17th century killjoy oliver cromwell hangs over the festivities 
the staunch puritan who ran the country between 1642 and 1660 
banned hearty christmas feasting and no one can say for sure that 
the law has been revoked 
so it may still be illegal in terms of the 1644 act to bake and 
eat mince pies and christmas pudding on christmas day cromwell 
ruled that these were abominable and idolatrous confections to be 
avoided by christians 
and woe betide anyone who manages a christmas dinner of more 
than three courses simple gluttony to cromwells puritan way of 
thinking 
geoffrey humphrys who has spent hours among the statute books 
in his local library says he believes cromwells law is probably 
still in force 
some people argue that the cromwell era was simply a kind of 
interim period between the dissolution of the monarchy and its 
restoration and that his laws are not to be taken seriously he 
said in an interview from his home in north walsham norfolk 
but some are still on the statute book ive seen them 
fortunately the puritans more drastic antichristmas measures 
did get the chop according to jm golby and aw purdue authors 
of the making of the modern christmas 
for a dozen years the traditional christmas festivities were 
prohibited parliament sat on christmas day its soldiers attempted 
to ensure shops were open and the churches remained closed while 
evergreen decorations were prohibited they said 
finally the good and aggrieved men of kent marched in support 
of christmas jolliness ten thousand signed a resolution that if 
they could not have their christmas day they would have the king 
back on his throne 
with the restoration of the monarchy after cromwell most 
christmas customs were legalized once again 
according to golby and purdue the puritans objected to 
christmas celebrations because the holiday was rooted in pagan 
worship 
ancient britons celebrated dec 25 as the birthday of the 
unconquered sun marking the death of the old year and the 
beginning of the new 
but cromwell wasnt the only spoilsport in english history who 
tampered with christmas humphrys has discovered 
the holy days and fasting days act of 1551 never revoked 
according to humphrys research makes it illegal to skip church on 
christmas day and there are penalties for those who have no 
lawful or reasonable excuse to be absent 
this law he says also obliges worshipers to walk to church and 
back other exercise is largely forbidden the only sports allowed 
by the lawful games act of 1541 are archery leaping and vaulting 
according to humphrys 
an act of 1625 decrees that footballers may kick a ball around 
but only in their own back yards as there shall be no meetings 
assemblings or concourses of people out of their owne parishes for 
any sporte or pastime whatsoever that law is still rigorously 
enforced 
there is also no chance of going out and shooting the extra 
pheasant if unexpected guests arrive a law enacted in 1831 says 
the only legal use of a weapon on christmas day is in defense of 
the realm or in self defense says humphrys 
the office of the lord chancellor chief legal officer of 
england and wales was tickled by humphrys christmas thesis 
we dont really have an expert on this subject said a 
spokesman cloaked as always in anonymity obviously its a bit 
obscure 
however he said it was quite likely humphrys was correct if 
something is in the statutes in force book it is still the law no 
matter how old it is 
however legislation of 1831 stipulates nobody can be arrested 
for anything but serious crime or breach of the peace on dec 25 
humphrys said 
and anyway he adds policemen should not be on the beat on 
christmas day 
a law promulgated under king charles ii in 1677 state that 
noe servant artificer workeman labourer or other person 
whatsoever shall do or exercise any worldly labours business or 
worke of their ordinary callings on that day

six robed ku klux klan members gathered in a 
downtown plaza today and were met by 1500 people who shouted down 
their speeches and threw objects at them police said seven people 
were arrested 
police sprayed mace to stop protesters who charged them as they 
escorted the klansmen to a nearby building after the 45minute 
rally in fountain square 
a demonstrator who threw something at one of the klanmans cars 
as they drove off was among those arrested on charges of disorderly 
conduct at least one fist fight broke out in the crowd 
it was getting ugly real quick said assistant police chief 
edward ammann 
he said police recovered 40 to 50 objects the protesters threw 
during the rally including rocks ball bearings pieces of 
machinery and a twopound can of sliced pineapple 
its one of the more serious demonstrations that weve had 
police chief lawrence whalen said 
one fire captain was injured when he was struck in the arm by a 
thrown object whalen said no other injuries were reported 
the klansmen barred by a city council directive from concealing 
their faces behind hoods erected a 10foot wooden cross in the 
square which is decorated with christmas trees as protesters 
shouted death to the klan 
city officials cited safety concerns in denying the klan 
permission to set fire to the cross 
a klansman began the rally by holding up a bible and yelling 
life life through jesus but when the speaker grabbed a 
bullhorn jeers and taunts drowned out the rest of his address 
america loves ignorant idiots one heckler yelled 
its a damn shame the city is protecting them shouted 
another 
police had said they did not expect a large turnout of klan 
members the history of these things is if you have two dozen 
klansmen there youll have a lot ammann said 
the us knights of the ku klux klan based in hamilton had 
planned to have several speakers at the rally ron lee the groups 
imperial vice president had said he wanted no violence 
as ordered by the city the klansmen removed the cross after the 
rally because the city opposes leaving religious symbols on the 
square city lawyers have said cincinnati wants to avoid legal 
debates about government entanglement with religion 
the klan obtained the rally permit after a federal judge allowed 
a jewish congregation to put a menorah on the square for the full 
eight days of hanukkah 
city council members on wednesday enacted a ban on wearing hoods 
or masks on public property saying they were concerned about the 
possibility of violence violation of the ordinance is punishable 
by up to of 30 days in jail and a 250 fine 
councilman nick vehr who proposed the ordinance said police 
need it to identify lawbreakers vehr modeled the ban on a 
39yearold georgia law which was upheld by that states supreme 
court this year 
lee had said that after going ahead with its rally the klan 
would file a lawsuit in federal court challenging the new ordinance 
as a violation of members civil rights

instead of getting married 
over the christmas holidays navy lt dan turner will be practicing 
combat tactics in his a7 light attack aircraft 
petty officer 2nd class joseph roberts desperately wants to 
spend christmas with the 3monthold son hes never seen but hell 
be repairing jet engines 
trying to cope with his first christmas away from his family 
fireman apprentice deval sanders will spend the day helping to run 
the generators on the aircraft carrier uss john f kennedy a 
prospect he finds very depressing 
eight christmas trees have been flown to the carrier in the 
northern red sea the catapult shuttle that hurls the attack jets 
and fighters into flight has been painted with the words merry 
xmas the american public has overwhelmed the ship with christmas 
cards and goodies 
but even with the trimmings much of the traditional holiday 
spirit will be missing for the 5200 sailors and fliers on the 
kennedy who know they could be at war with iraq within weeks 
capt john p gay a decorated vietnam war combat pilot who took 
command of the 82000ton carrier earlier this month has decided 
that christmas is going to be a regular working day 
that means most of the 70odd strike aircraft on the carrier 
will be flying which will leave few sailors much time to dwell on 
war peace or family celebrations back home 
capt jim oconnor the carriers chief chaplain said it would 
be a lowkey christmas 
you dont want to overdo it because guys are trying to work 
through being away from their families he said if you overdo 
it you simply deepen the pain shall we say its going to turn 
them off 
since the kennedy is in international waters christmas services 
can be held openly unlike in saudi arabia where only moslem 
religious observances are legal the us military said religious 
services for troops in the desert will be held privately 
there will be a christmas eve candlelight service for 
protestants on the kennedy midnight mass for catholics a 
christmas day service and a band of roaming troubadors singing 
carols from table to table in the mess halls 
theres a certain intensity at this time because of the 
possibility of war and theres that matter of separation said 
oconnor a 51yearold lutheran minister from new port richey 
fla 
i myself think this is a time to take christmas seriously 
and ask jesus to be the prince of peace he said 
from the boiler room in the bowels of the huge carrier to the 
bridge overlooking the flight deck there is a sense of unease 
nobody knows when theyre going home everybodys life is on hold 
for lt turner a 29yearold pilot from jacksonville fla 
christmas was supposed to be spent with his parents in san diego 
and four days later he was to walk down the aisle with his fiance 
jodee 
were trying for march 23 but i dont know if were even 
going to make that he said 
instead of prewedding festivities turner will take a break 
from flying and join fellow pilots to open stockings sent by the 
wives club of va72 squadron their ready room is adorned with 
a christmas tree decorations and a huge card on the wall with 
photos of wives girlfriends children and pet dogs peeping out of 
christmas ornaments 
for roberts a 31yearold aviation maintenance technician from 
boston christmas is going to be lousy because he still hasnt 
seen his son ryan thomas 
ive seen pictures of him he said 
sanders a 22yearold damage control apprentice from michigan 
city ind said he knows hes going to be a little homesick on 
christmas 
ive got to block it out he said 
other members of the crew are trying to cope in different ways 
petty officer 3rd class janofsky herrion 21 of essex mo a 
mechanic said hes glad christmas wont be a holiday here 
if we werent flying wed just be sitting around wondering 
what our families are doing wishing that we could be there our 
reality is were out here and weve got a job to do he said 
its going to be a special christmas for me just because of 
all the support weve gotten from back home said lt cmdr val 
diers 33 of norman okla the maintenance officer for an a7 
squadron 
speaking of the gift packages he said im convinced by the

resourceful iraqi bakers may have found one 
answer to shortages of sugar caused by the un sanctions imposed 
against iraq after its invasion of kuwait 
dates are the iraqis favorite winter fruit but they have 
rarely tried to turn them into desserts 
now though confectionaries are now making datebased sweets 
instead of the traditional richer sweets that require plenty of 
sugar flour and fat to make 
the younger generations have heard about a delicacy called 
madgoga from their grandmothers but a few have tasted the sweet 
madgoga is cheap and easy to make i wonder why we had 
forgotten it and have only remembered our best traditional sweets 
in this hour of crisis said abdul hussein jawad whose family is 
a wellknown baghdad sweetmaker 
jawad said he makes madgoga by adding sesame paste to ground 
dates sometimes he adds nuts and coconuts to make it tastier and 
more nourishing 
dates and milk constituted the staple diet of bedouin tribes in 
the desert mainly because the fruit is rich in vitamins and milk 
prevents dehydration 
madgoga was rediscovered after sweets shops were forced to close 
in the wake of international sanctions that followed the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the embargo has forced the government to ration food items 
including cooking oil flour milk and sugar these items have 
disappeared from the markets but families receive limited 
quantities from government centers 
iraq claims that more than 2000 children under age 5 have died 
because of shortages in medicines and baby food that followed the 
un embargo diplomats say there are no serious shortages of basic 
medicines 
iraq the worlds leading producer of dates used to provide 
international markets with more than 80 percent of its supplies 
under the un trade embargo iraq was expected to lose about 50 
million in date exports this year 
the country produces 300 kinds of dates but exports about 20 
varieties keeping the rest for domestic consumption

chief petty officer lance vickery recalls 
waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to 
the uss saratoga and joking whoa looks like were flooding 
only minutes later his words came true turning a simple ride 
back from christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive 
the israeli ferry tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on 
saturday throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of haifa 
bay at least 19 sailors drowned and scores were injured the 
sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against iraq 
vickery 33 was among four american sailors interviewed at 
haifas rambam hospital he is from jacksonville fla is not far 
from mayport the saragotas home port 
three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over 
the stern in heavy seas then capsized when it was hit by a big 
wave 
vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had 
cracked his joke 
all of a sudden i saw water just come flying in he said 
and it was maybe two seconds and the boat rolled right over 
the 13year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferrys 
cabin frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank 
i started breathing in water and almost died vickery said 
if i had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds i 
wouldnt be lying here right now id be in one of those body bags 
out there 
when he made his way to the surface he found guys floating 
everywhere screaming and yelling like chaos 
despite his own predicament he grabbed a struggling fellow 
sailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating plastic 
foam life ring one rescue boat already overloaded passed by and 
threw life preservers 
in what seemed like an hour another boat came also full 
so they just dragged us through the water back to the 
saratoga and i was a real happy person to see those guys snatching 
me up he said 
as vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water 
inhalation his hospital roommate seaman michael benjamin 19 of 
san antonio texas was recovering from a neck injury suffered when 
a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water 
both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and when they walked to 
the visiting rooms balcony could see the saratoga anchored outside 
the haifa harbor 
benjamin who has been in the navy for just a year said the 
ferry had been jostled in heavy seas 
as we were going on the waves i just noticed one that was 
bigger than normal and then another one that was bigger than 
normal he said the next thing i know all i saw coming in was 
water he said 
benjamin said he dove from the ferry then had to swim 
frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat 
clinging to a foam plastic float he was passed by one rescue 
boat and hit by a second 
i looked around and i see this big hull coming at me and we 
were all yelling but i guess the ship didnt see us he said 
i was trying to get out of the way but i got hit by the ship 
dazed benjamin stripped off his jacket shirt and shoes and 
kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling 
to 
i was scared he admitted i was having a hard time 
staying up in the water 
a rescue ship picked him up he estimated about a half hour to 
45 minutes later 
two other men interviewed at rambam hospital identified 
themselves as technician john richards 31 of twin lake mich 
and airman lamont jones 20 of claremont va 
both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks 
richards recalled seeing a large wave and feeling the ship 
heeling to one side 
all i can remember thinking is oh my god its sinking and 
then i was scrambling for my life he said faintly

throughout the persian gulf region 
airline tickets are selling out and moving companies are busy 
packing as foreigners rush to leave before the jan 15 deadline for 
iraq to leave kuwait or face possible force 
britain ireland sweden and new zealand are among countries 
that have recently advised dependents of nationals working in 
bahrain neighboring qatar and parts of saudi arabia to leave the 
region before the deadline expires 
travel agencies are being flooded with calls as thousands try to 
purchase air tickets either because theyre leaving soon or as a 
precaution in case they have to leave later 
the phones are ringing all the time said bill horsley 
sales manager at bahrains kanoo travel agency one of the largest 
in the region 
horsley said companies were booking seats in blocks on some 
flights to europe and other points to make sure that their people 
are protected 
airlines and travel agents surveyed in bahrain said flights to 
britain the philippines india and egypt were fully booked from 
about jan 4 through jan 15 with long waiting lists in some 
cases the lists are so long theyve been closed off 
i wouldnt say theres panic but concern is spreading 
horsley said 
he added that many of those who have reserved seats may not use 
them after all citing the period immediately following the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait when about half the passengers who bought 
tickets out of the region later sent them back for refunds 
the british community in bahrain is down from around 9000 
before the invasion to 4500 and numbers are still falling 
following the british governments advice that all dependents 
should leave by jan 15 
there about 750 us nationals in bahrain the us government 
has not advised citizens to leave and embassy officials say there 
is no immediate sign of an american exodus 
the officials have assured americans that they will be protected 
in case of war and evacuated if necessary 
about half of this island nations 500000 inhabitants are 
expatriates 
so far india pakistan the philippines and other third world 
nations that provide the bulk of the expatriate work force in 
bahrain have not advised their citizens to leave 
the foreign exodus from bahrain does not appear to be as 
pronounced as in eastern saudi arabia there the great majority of 
westerners are reported to be leaving except for those in 
essential jobs 
the us community mainly oil workers and their families has 
shrunk from 12000 people to 8000 in recent weeks and the exodus 
is expected to accelerate before jan15 
among those britons planning to stay in bahrain with his family 
is richard warnes a senior engineer at the staterun electricity 
company who has been in the country for 12 years 
when the shooting starts the first thing that will happen is 
bahrain airport will be closed and well be stuck here said 
warnes 43 
weve decided well stay here and sit it out were expecting 
a shooting war its going to be pretty nasty a lot of troops are 
going to suffer 
but warnes expressed confidence in the defensive shield laid 
around bahrain by the usled multinational force including 
antimissile and antiaircraft defenses 
he acknowledged there is a risk that iraqi missiles with 
chemical warheads might get through and hit bahrain but he was 
confident that 99 percent would miss their targets or be shot down 
our main worry is what will happen with the schools said 
warnes father of a 6yearold girl and 7yearold boy 
as civilians leave the island schools have been losing teachers 
and some are shutting down 
moving companies report a heavy workload as expatriate families 
ship their household belongings out of the region 
were seeing more people moving for good rather than just 
sending some of their stuff away said louise foster of scotpac 
international removals 
ms foster said the company was shipping out dozens of 
households a week and only two households have shipped their 
belongings into bahrain through her company so far this month

boats and a building caught fire at a marina pier 
on the lake washington ship canal early saturday and three people 
jumped into the water to escape the flames officials said 
firefighters had to fight the blaze in belowfreezing 
temperatures and cramped space at the end of a deadend street the 
national weather service said the temperature was in the teens and 
the windchill factor near zero 
the fire was at the leco marine pier east of ballard bridge on 
the south side of the canal that links lake union with puget sound 
the blaze was fueled by creosotetreated wood on the pier and by 
barrels of flammable liquids after spreading to a twostory 
building used by leclair marine construction 
firefighters and witnesses said the fire apparently started in a 
wood stove aboard a 30foot pleasure boat moored at the pier 
however fire department spokesman albert smalls said he could not 
confirm that was the cause 
when the flames spread to the pier one couple tried 
unsuccessfully to start their boat motor to flee the crew of a 
police boat told them to jump in the water 
they said bail out and then they threw their dog in the 
water said kent ferris who watched from shore about 30 
seconds later the boat went up 
smalls said a third person also jumped 
there were about 30 boats along the shore and some burned with 
flames leaping from boat to boat smalls said at least three boats 
were destroyed he said damage would be significant but had no 
dollar estimate 
three people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation

while crude oil prices have plunged since 
october the sign at fletchers amoco last week still read 137 a 
gallon for unleaded gasoline only a couple of pennies less than 
when oil prices peaked nearly two months ago 
and fletchers isnt alone in being slow to drop prices its 
pump price reflects the national average according to the american 
automobile association 
many factors may be helping to keep prices up but a major 
reason is that dealers are trying to recoup losses they incurred in 
august when their profit margin was severely squeezed 
we would like to keep the prices coming down said bobby 
fletcher owner of the station along a busy commuter corridor 
outside washington 
but in an interview last week fletcher said he couldnt make 
sharp cuts and still keep a reasonable margin considering what he 
pays for gasoline and a recent federal gas tax hike 
the exxon station across the street showed the same price and a 
crown gasandgo down the road was just a penny cheaper 
industry officials say retail prices are in fact coming down 
and in recent days some dealers have dropped unleaded regular a few 
pennies a gallon some of that decline however has been masked by 
the 5cent increase in the federal gasoline tax last dec 1 
the slow price decline has left many motorists perplexed as they 
recall the lightning price increases that took place at gasoline 
pumps in the days after the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait when 
the price of crude oil soared 
although crude oil prices have fallen from a peak of 4040 a 
barrel in early october to about 27 a barrel last week the price 
of retail gasoline has remained almost steady during most of that 
period 
in its prechristmas survey of 5000 service stations the 
american automobile association reported friday the average price 
for unleaded regular gasoline was 137 a gallon only 14 cents 
lower than in the week before thanksgiving or about 30 cents a 
gallon higher than beore the persian gulf crisis began 
wholesale gasoline spot prices on the new york exchange closed 
last thursday a penny lower than preiraqi invasion levels and 
crude prices were only 17 cents a gallon higher 
we think its outrageous said joan claybrook president of 
public citizen a washington consumer advocacy group she said that 
with the current rollercoaster price situation for oil and refined 
products there was too much opportunity to maneuver all along 
the line from oil production to retail sales 
theyre trying to recoup some of the costs that they claim was 
never passed along but the motorist is at the end of the chain and 
has not had the relief says richard hebert a spokesman for 
the aaa 
but those in the oil industry from producers to refiners to 
gasoline dealers vigorously deny any price gouging their prices 
are dictated primarily by supply and demand they argue 
were returning to our normal margins said charles dibona 
president of the american petroleum institute the oil company 
trade group the price of crude went way up the price of 
gasoline went up half as much the price of crude is falling back 
somewhat and youre back to a normal relationship 
phillip chisholm executive vice president of the petroleum 
marketers association said dealers and middlemen were severely 
squeezed in august and september between rising costs and pressure 
to keep prices down a lot of them are trying to recover the 
margins that they lost he said 
gasoline prices never increased as much as crude oil partly 
because oil companies heeded the pleas from president bush in late 
august and september to curb prices refiners and retail dealers 
took the hit 
according to figures compiled by the american petroleum 
institute spot crude prices increased 46 cents a gallon in the two 
months after iraq invaded kuwait refiners on average passed only 
33 of those cents onto dealers who in turn passed only 25 cents 
to their customers 
as a result their margin the difference between what the gas 
costs them and what they sell it for virtually disappeared for a 
time some dealers reported selling gasoline for what they paid for 
it and absorbing overhead costs 
a few days after the price of crude hit 4040 a barrel in early 
october wholesale gasoline prices peaked at nearly 1 a gallon at 
the pump service station owners added on taxes 30 to 35 cents 
depending on the locality and transportation costs plus a 
margin 
according to industry experts dealers typically want to 
maintain a 6 cent to 7 cent margin which includes their overhead 
costs and a profit 
retail prices jumped to about 138 cents a gallon on average 
nationwide in early october according to the aaa surveys 
as tensions eased somewhat in the mideast the price of crude 
began to drop through november and december and oil companies 
began to lower wholesale prices as well 
average wholesale prices at the refineries before taxes and 
transportation were 97 cents a gallon in late october those 
prices dropped to 77 cents by middecember only about a dime 
higher than preiraqi invasion levels according to api figures 
our average wholesale gasoline price in the 30 states we 
market is down about 20 cents a gallon from middle october said 
neal geary a spokesman for amoco in chicago mobil reported that 
prices to its dealers have dropped about 8 cents a gallon this 
month 
those wholesale price reductions in general appear not to have 
been matched by dealers at fletchers amoco the price hit a peak 
of 144 on dec 1 after the nickelagallon federal tax went into 
effect it has since droppe to 137 fletcher wouldnt reveal his 
wholesale price referring such questions to amoco 
to some extent youre trying to recoup from the lost margins 
as crude oil prices soared fletcher said 
but customers are price sensitive and he anticipated further 
declines soon

the food and drug administration says army 
doctors in the persian gulf need not obtain patient consent before 
using experimental drugs on the battlefield particularly in the 
event of chemical or biological warfare 
the new rule signed friday by health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan and deputy fda commissioner james s 
benson grants defense department requests to waive patient consent 
in using investigational new drugs in certain battlefield or 
combatrelated situations 
combatrelated might mean only the threat of combat the 
regulation said 
armed forces doctors like civilian physicians normally must 
get informed consent before using such drugs but the pentagon in 
an oct 30 letter to the fda requesting the waiver said military 
combat is different 
if a soldiers life will be endangered by nerve gas for 
example it is not acceptable from a military standpoint to defer 
to whatever might be the soldiers personal preference concerning a 
preventive or therapeutic treatment that might save his life avoid 
endangerment of the other personnel in his unit and accomplish the 
combat mission the letter said 
based on unalterable requirements of the military field 
commander it is not an option to excuse a nonconsenting soldier 
from the military mission nor would it be defensible militarily 
or ethically to send the soldier unprotected into danger 
investigational new drugs are those that have emerged from 
formal clinical trials and are being used by physicians who promise 
to report results but have not yet been granted full approval by 
the fda 
the pentagon and fda did not reveal what drugs were involved 
but the pentagon stressed that these are not exotic new drugs 
but dr sidney m wolfe director of the public citizen health 
research group said saturday the new regulation was an outrage 
because it told soldiers in the field they are going to become 
guinea pigs for drugs not proven to be safe and effective 
wolfe said there was still more than three weeks before the jan 
15 un deadline authorizing the use of force if iraq does not 
leave kuwait there is plenty of time to have soldiers sign consent 
sheets concerning use of experimental drugs he said 
it is immoral and unethical to force people to go into battle 
having them subjected to unknown risks of unknown drugs wolfe 
said 
the pentagon letter which was published friday in the federal 
register said among drugs being considered were a common 
intramuscular injector in a different packaging and a vaccine long 
recognized as effective against a specific disease but not used 
enough to accumulate data needed for a regular drug license 
another is a drug in common use at a particular dosage level 
but to preserve alertness of the soldiers we prefer a lower dosage 
tablet that the fda has not approved the pentagon letter said

here is the text of the philadelphia 
inquirers editorial in sundays editions headlined an 
apology and subtitled the editorial on norplant and poverty 
was misguided and wrongheaded 
 
its rare that we regret publishing an editorial from almost the 
moment it appears in print and its rarer still that we feel the 
need to apologize to our readers for a misguided and wrongheaded 
editorial opinion but such is the case with the editorial that 
appeared in this space on dec 12 entitled norplant and 
poverty great pain anger and controversy have resulted from 
that editorial and we deeply regret our decision to print it 
among the people who were incensed by the editorial were many of 
the inquirers own reporters editors and members of the editorial 
board in the days since it appeared we have been doing a lot of 
listening and soulsearching 
we realize now that we hastily and foolishly juxtaposed two news 
items that appeared in the inquirer the previous day federal 
approval of the longterm contraceptive norplant and the release of 
a research groups report that said nearly half of black children 
are living in poverty and that the situation is getting worse with 
time the editorial posed the question of whether encouraging women 
who are on welfare to use norplant could help reverse this bleak 
trend 
where did we go wrong lets begin with the headline which 
asked whether contraception could reduce the underclass and 
thus aroused peoples fears of something far worse than promoting 
birth control later we used the word eugenics as a way of 
explaining what we didnt mean but it only inflamed matters more 
most fundamentally in linking the issues of race and 
contraception we left too many people with the impression that our 
cure for poverty was to reduce the number of black people although 
that certainly was not what we meant to suggest the fact that so 
many people interpreted it that way is a clear indication that the 
editorial was fatally flawed therefore we failed in our effort to 
provoke thoughtful discussion on the issue of birth control and 
poverty 
its true that many single young women lessen their chances of 
escaping poverty by having children too early in life but its 
also true that the very hopelessness of their circumstances often 
underlies the decision not to postpone childbearing creating hope 
where none now exists must be the main tenet of any effective war 
on poverty 
in the previous editorial we said that women on welfare should 
be encouraged but not compelled to use norplant we suggested 
incentives such as an additional benefit of some kind our critics 
countered that to dangle cash or some other benefit in front of a 
desperately poor woman is tantamount to coercion theyre right 
we still believe that this new form of reliable birth control 
which is likely to have wide appeal to middleclass women should 
be equally available to poor women who want to use it but we also 
realize and should have been even clearer about it that this 
has to be a matter of personal choice we dont seek to limit the 
options of poor women but to empower them 
we remain committed to a whole host of strategies for reducing 
poverty from better schools to job training to radical welfare 
reform we think education about birth control is important and if 
norplant lives up to its advance billing it could be helpful to 
many women 
and we wish we had said it that way to begin with the earlier 
norplant editorial undercut our credibility and our efforts to be a 
thoughtful responsible and compassionate voice on the complex 
issues of poverty we apologize to those we hurt and offended

lech walesa who led solidaritys 10year 
struggle to depose communist rule took the oath saturday as his 
nations first popularly elected president and declared poland 
finally free of foreign domination 
the 47yearold labor activist a peasants son who was educated 
to repair machinery pointedly excluded his communist predecessor 
from the swearingin ceremony before parliament 
he pledged that poland would become a stable element in a 
peaceful europe seek friendly relations with its neighbors and 
continue the dramatic market reforms started by the government of 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who walesa defeated in the 
elections 
walesas swearingin came a decade after he led the shipyard 
strike that created the east blocs first independent trade union 
and one year since he put together its first noncommunist 
government 
i solemnly swear to the polish people that i will be faithful 
to constitutional decisions i will protect the dignity of the 
nation the sovereignty and security of the state said walesa in 
a clear voice holding up his right hand 
his wife danuta stood solemnly at his side 
walesa did not invite president wojciech jaruzelski the 
longtime communist leader who imposed martial law to crush 
solidarity in 1981 and imprisoned walesa for nearly a year 
present instead of jaruzelski was ryszard kaczorowski president 
of the anticommunist governmentinexile in london the 
governmentinexile was set up after the prewar warsaw government 
was forced to flee the nazis in 1939 
kaczorowski 71 was received as a head of state as he returned 
to his homeland for the first time on a specially dispatched 
government plane 
handing over the presidential insignia seals handwritten 
constitution and other symbols of prewar authority in the gilded 
royal castle kaczorowski said the governmentinexile had 
fulfilled its mission and could now cease to exist 
walesa also accepted the blessing of the church a mass was 
scheduled in his honor by the roman catholic primate cardinal 
jozef glemp 
hundreds of people chanting our president our president 
lined the narrow cobblestone lanes of the old town when walesa 
walked the short distance from the castle to st johns athedral 
he raised his hand in his familiar vforvictory sign made 
famous during solidaritys struggle 
in his inaugural speech walesa said the evil era when the 
authorities of our country were appointed under pressure of 
foreigners or as the result of forced compromises is ending 
poland has known only 21 years of full independence since it was 
partitioned in 1795 it was reconstituted as the second republic in 
1918 only to fall under german and then sovietimposed communist 
rule for 50 years until solidarity took over the government in 
1989 jaruzelski remained as president under a negotiated deal he 
stepped down early to make way for new elections 
walesa pledged poland now would become an element of the 
peaceful order in europe he said it seeks good relations with 
germany and its neighbors to the east lithuania ukraine 
byelorussia and russia he did not mention the soviet union 
he told poles that saturday was the beginning of the third 
polish republic but that they must believe in themselves 
passivity and apathy these are the biggest obstacles on the 
road toward the wellbeing of poles the president said when 
we start to work with confidence the most developed countries will 
show more interest in us as well 
he promised to stick to the shock economic reform program named 
for finance minister leszek balcerowicz which he said was a sign 
to the world of polands determination and ability to make 
sacrifices 
after taking his oath the beaming walesa was rewarded with 
cheers of sto lat may you live 100 years by 
parliamentarians and invited guests 
later he visited the presidential palace belweder palace 
where he received a traditional slavic welcome in the form of bread 
and salt the former army corporal also received a pledge of 
loyalty from polands generals and admirals in an outdoor military 
ceremony 
walesas critics citing his dominating personality and reliance 
on national symbols have voiced fear he might become a strongman 
he won a landslide victory dec 9 over businessman stanislaw 
tyminski but the bitter election campaign shattered solidaritys 
unity leaving walesa alienated from his rival mazowiecki and 
most of his former intellectual advisers 
as president walesa is chief of state and commander of the 
military his first task will be to nominate a prime minister to 
run the government on a daytoday basis 
he must also prepare for elections that will replace the 
parliament elected under the 1989 bargain with the communists that 
guaranteed 65 percent of seats to the nowdissolved party and its 
allies 
walesa said thursday that he will not name a prime minister 
until after the holidays

it was billed as a big idea with big 
results converting an abandoned factory into the worlds largest 
museum of contemporary art 
but five years later the project that piqued interest in art 
circles and set hope alight in this struggling mill city has run 
into a serious setback state planning officials refused to grant 
full certification to the plans 
inspector general joseph r barresi a vocal critic said that 
as a practical matter that decision will close the book on the 
museum 
but proponents stoutly deny the projects dead 
weve pulled this out of the fire before said north adams 
mayor john barrett iii whos also chairman of the cultural 
development commission that oversaw a 17 million feasibility 
study 
ive been in the game too long to just fold said david 
ross director of the institute of contemporary art in boston and 
another commission member 
the plan to turn the old 28building sprague electronics co 
factory into the home of huge minimalist works and other 
contemporary art was hailed at its inception as a way to bring 
benefits of the states then strong economy to a forgotten corner 
of the berkshires 
but then the states fortunes dropped and questions arose 
we cant deny essential services to mentally retarded and 
elderly people while we buy millions of dollars of modern art to be 
placed out in the berkshires said state rep greg sullivan 
a statement released last week from govelect william welds 
office said only that he would take a very good hard look at it 
but he feels as though its going to have to compete with other 
projects given existing resources 
among the questions raised by critics of the project are its 
attendance projections proponents project that the museum would 
bring 130000 people or more a year to the site at least 2 hours 
by car from boston critics note that that would be more than the 
number of people who visit the nearby clark art institute which 
has traditional works of art and has free admission 
thomas krens who devised the idea while he was director of the 
williams college art museum said hes optimistic about the 
project but he added 
over the course of the last year the rules have subtly 
shifted in the middle of the game 
krens now director of the solomon r guggenheim museum in new 
york resigned from the cultural development commission at a 
meeting this month after members voted to send out a request for 
operating proposals from established institutions including the 
guggenheim 
at that meeting its first in more than a year the commission 
approved a revision of the original plan study sending it on to 
the division of capital planning and operations 
it excluded hotel and other commercial space and carried a price 
tag of about 45 million for the first phase compared with earlier 
estimates of 77 million a key change was the decision to request 
proposals for an operator a decision proponents likened to looking 
for an anchor store for a shopping mall 
but then the division of capital planning and operations deputy 
commissioner john i carlson jr said he could certify only two 
of the five key items the physical plans and cost estimate 
carlson said he could not certify as feasible parts of the plan 
dealing with a required 30 percent nonstate share of the 
financing management and operations plans and the availability of 
art and money for its installation 
carlsons decision was released monday by barresi not carlson 
himself carlson followed that release with a terse statement 
leaving the door open for a revised plan from the museum proponents 
that could possibly meet his objections 
in his decision carlson urged the drafting of a new grant 
agreement it should include such specific conditions as securing a 
museum operator and presenting a business plan and fiveyear 
operating budget projection

he left no footprints on the national scene and 
was considered dull as dishwater at home but gov joe frank harris 
quietly put his mark on georgia through education reform and the 
historic appointment of a black to the states highest bench 
harris retires next month after eight years in office to be 
succeeded by lt gov zell miller 
the criminal justice system was one of the last bastions of 
old south racism and his breakthrough there was important said 
joseph lowery president of the southern christian leadership 
conference 
lowery said he gives harris an a1 grade for appointing 
black lawyer robert benham first to the court of appeals and later 
to the supreme court 
harris also sent the national guard to racially troubled forsyth 
county in 1987 to protect civil rights demonstrators staging a 
march against segregation that drew national attention 
jimmy carters progress on civil rights in his 19711974 term 
helped him jump from the governors mansion to the white house but 
national attention wasnt in the cards for nonsmoking 
nondrinking nocussing harris 
i havent been flamboyant harris conceded in a recent 
interview explaining that the lack of razzledazzle in personal 
style stemmed from a bit of fatherly advice years ago 
something my dad used to tell me is that people can spot a 
phony three miles away and that you need to be what you are and 
thats what ive always tried to do to be joe frank harris 
day in day out i just want to be what i am 
education reform was the issue that dominated his 
administration but he also doubled the size of the states prison 
system and directed the passage of legislation to bring order to 
the states haphazard growth 
he kept a lid on taxes for his first term making good on a 
campaign promise that helped put him into office but he didnt 
renew the notax pledge to win reelection in 1986 and three years 
later presided over the largest tax increase in state history 
now the state is teetering on the edge of a recessioninduced 
financial slide 
environmental issues were particularly troublesome for harris 
his attempt to build a hazardous waste disposal facility 
rekindled an environmental movement in the state as angry opponents 
of the project banded together the facility still has not been 
built 
harris a state legislator for 18 years was elected to office 
in 1982 with the backing of the conservative church vote a boost 
from his nonewtaxes pledge and the support of his political 
mentor powerful house speaker tom murphy 
education reform was the persistent dream of the harris 
administrtion shortly after taking office he appointed an 
education review commission the result was a legislative act that 
restructured the way georgia schools were funded organized and 
taught 
the reform boosted state and local spending for education by 75 
percent over five years and early indicators show student scores 
are up but the state still is troubled by a high dropout rate and 
teachers and administrators still complain of low salaries and too 
much paperwork 
on the social front his administration reacted to publicity 
about the chaotic state of procedures for investigating suspected 
child abuse by supporting legislation designed to improve the 
system 
there were modest increases in welfare benefits during his 
administration and tentative steps toward helping the homeless 
but critics give him his lowest marks for social concerns 
i feel like joe frank never did listen to the cries of the 
poor the sick the helpless or the children said frances 
pauley an 85yearold human rights activist 
i dont think he set us back said lowery of the sclc i 
just think he didnt drag us forward

the syrianbacked popular front for the 
liberation of palestine reopened its office in baghdad saturday 11 
years after it was closed by the iraqi government following a split 
with damascus 
abdulrahim malouh a member of the groups politburo said 
reopening the office was meant to express solidarity with iraq in 
its standoff against the united states in the persian gulf crisis 
malouh said the damascusbased group would fight alongside iraq 
if war erupted but he did not elaborate 
the pflp formed by george habash in 1967 is a marxist radical 
faction of the palestine liberation organization it has one seat 
on the plos executive committee and is the secondlargest group in 
the plo next to yasser arafats fatah 
iraq closed down the groups offices in 1979 shortly after 
baghdad and damascus ruled by rival wings of the arab baath 
socialist party broke relations 
malouh said the group will maintain its main offices in 
damascus although he acknowledged that the syrian government might 
not be happy about the groups having an office in iraq 
the reopening of our office at this time has a very 
significant meaning it means we support iraq fully and completely 
in its struggle against the united states he said 
malouh said the group did not consult the syrian government 
before opening the office in baghdad but damascus has not objected 
to it 
syria has committed 20000 troops to the usled military 
buildup in the persian gulf region 
habash visited iraq after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait and said 
the pflp would support president saddam hussein in his effort to 
link the palestinian issue with resolution of the gulf crisis 
saddam has tried to link an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait with an 
israeli withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the palestine liberation front headed by abul abbas has 
offices in iraq 
another radical faction the democratic front for the liberation 
of palestine is expected to open its offices here soon that group 
is headed by nayef hawatmeh who split with habash in 1969 after a 
dispute over ideology and direction

like farmers all over china this 
year ma ziwen reaped one of his best wheat crops ever but the 
bumper harvest has brought disappointment for ma and problems for 
the government 
the official media for months have been filled with reports of a 
bountiful grain harvest from the high plateaus of tibet where 
barley is grown to the fertile rice paddies of the southeast 
the crops were so plentiful that free market prices tumbled 
that meant ma a young farmer in northern chinas ningxia hui 
autonomous region lost the profits he expected from farming 10 
extra acres this year hed hoped to earn enough to buy a bicycle 
for the government the harvest is like a goodnews badnews 
joke it had mounted a major campaign this year to increase grain 
production and organized peasant brigades to irrigate more 
farmland 
but it found it lacked money to buy the harvest and facilities 
to store it 
the situation is not as severe as in the soviet union where 
distribution problems are expected to lead to widespread hunger 
this winter despite a record grain harvest but china does stand to 
lose much of the extra grain to spoilage 
one official estimate is that 42 million tons are lost every 
year because of poor storage facilities this year the loss likely 
will be higher because 33 million to 44 million tons of the 462 
million ton harvest are being stored outdoors 
china last year reaped 448 million tons equaling a 1984 record 
most of chinas grain is sold to the state under contracts that 
farmers sign individually each spring they are free to sell 
anything they produce over contract on chinas small free market 
but this years big supply caused free market prices to fall ma 
said he had hoped to get 1300 yuan or 250 for the 2200 pounds 
of grain he had left after fulfilling his contract instead free 
market buyers offered 820 yuan 160 
meanwhile the grain keeps flooding in 
in late november more than a month after the harvest farmers 
still were bringing loads to ningxias hexi township granary even 
though it had long since been filled granary workers said 
the nearby tongxin county granary stopped buying after it filled 
its warehouse in late october said granary director yang hanyu 
thats exactly what beijing wants to avoid it has ordered local 
grain bureaus to buy all grain if farmers do not want to sell their 
extra crops on the free market the government promised loans from 
the central bank to pay the bills but the money has been slow in 
coming 
the government fears social unrest in the countryside if farmers 
take heavy financial losses it also fears farmers will refuse en 
masse to plant as much grain next year and instead choose 
highprofit crops such as tobacco 
with the population at 113 billion and growing 15 percent 
annually the government says china must produce at least 500 
million tons by the year 2000 just to keep pace 
china imported 14 million tons of grain this year much of it 
from the united states but hopes to become selfsufficient 
increasing the harvest is not as easy as this years bumper crop 
made it look although the state increased spending on agriculture 
by 496 million or nearly 8 percent officials acknowledge a key 
reason for the good harvest was unusually good weather 
in order to make significant longterm gains the state would 
have to reorganize its agricultural system something that could 
be politically as well as economically difficult 
it would mean replacing the millions of tiny family farm plots 
with farms large enough to use heavy machinery and wellmanaged 
enough to use advanced technology it would also mean raising 
returns to farmers

to suggest that the cia was involved in the nations savings and 
loan scandal the chairman of the house intelligence committee 
says

announcing that the committee has decided not to proceed with a 
formal investigation of ties between cia operatives and failed 
sampls 
the committee conducted a ninemonth preliminary inquiry 
following reports in the houston post that 26 failed sampls were 
either controlled by or lent money to cia operatives or organized 
crime associates with connections to the agency

uncovered no evidence that they used their associations to 
facilitate fraudulent activities at financial institutions 
beilenson said in a letter to rep frank annunzio dill who

were used by the cia for financial services 
but the staff said it could not find any evidence that funds had 
been used to support unauthorized cia activities 
the post quoted the committees chief counsel michael sheehy 
as saying the panels staff had not attempted to track any sampl 
money obtained by cia operatives to determine if it had been used 
for illegal ciarelated purposes 
beilenson said that in some cases individuals claimed to know 
sources with information about cia involvement in savings and loan 
failures but he said they either refused to identify the source 
or the source refused to be interviewed

soviet lawmakers still reeling from last weeks 
sudden resignation of their foreign minister on saturday put off a 
controversial vote on granting more power to president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov meanwhile warned the country to 
brace for potential bloodshed in ethnic and separatist conflicts 
he told lawmakers the kgb needs more authority to combat economic 
sabotage and militant nationalism 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes parting warning that 
hardline lawmakers were pushing gorbachev to create a 
dictatorship apparently struck a chord forcing deputies to 
think carefully about giving gorbachev emergency presidential 
powers 
the 2250member congress of peoples deputies decided to begin 
preliminary voting on the issue on monday anatoly lukyanov 
chairman of the commission that drafted the amendment on 
presidential powers said lawmakers disagreed on some provisions 
and wanted more time to make changes 
the official tass news agency quoted lukyanov as saying some 
deputies wanted to build anew the whole structure of state 
power 
gorbachev is seeking direct control over a reorganized executive 
branch of government to deal with a worsening economy and 
fragmenting union 
if parliament trusts the president it should untie his hands 
and not hold him on a rope of parliamentary debate said 
lukyanov who is also a deputy in the congress 
lawmakers did give preliminary approval to a law setting down 
rules for holding nationwide referendums the law would require the 
signatures of 2 million citizens before holding votes on any 
subject except changing national or republic borders 
gorbachev has said he wants referendums held this winter on 
whether to allow private property and on whether the 15 republics 
should remain in a union all 15 of the republics have declared 
some form of sovereignty or independence 
the kgb chief warned that the restiveness could lead to 
violence 
today if we undertake decisive actions to restore order we 
have to accept the fact that there could be bloodshed he told 
lawmakers 
we will not avoid more serious consequences if we dont start 
immediately to fight destructive forces kryuchkov said 
he also said outside forces are trying to exert overt and 
covert pressure on the soviet union and to impose doubtful ideas 
and plans to pull the country out of its difficult situation 
the kgb chief accused us intelligence of gathering information 
on workers movements in the soviet union for its purposeful 
masterminding and of funding antisoviet formations such as 
radio stations that attack the soviet union 
kryuchkov did not say what kind of ideas he thought foreigners 
were trying to impose on the soviets 
he said some suppliers of humanitarian food aid were 
contributing to problems faced by the country saying that 40 
percent of a recent grain shipment contained spoiled or inferior 
quality seeds 
reformist lawmakers played down kryuchkovs speech 
russian federation president boris n yeltsin told reporters in 
the lobby yes there is sabotage yes there is corruption we 
have heard all this before 
algimantas cekuolis spokesman of the selfdeclared independent 
lithuanian government accused kryuchkov of using scare tactics 
that have failed before 
if he is speaking about bloodshed then it will be him who 
causes it said cekuolis who was attending the congress as an 
observer 
many congress members remained perturbed by shevardnadzes 
resignation 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov whose own resignation has 
long been demanded by liberals called shevardnadzes method of 
quitting during the congress unusual 
there is a definite resignation procedure and he should have 
taken advantage of it if i paid attention to criticism i could 
have hanged myself long ago he said according to tass 
shevardnadze had said he was tired of defending the governments 
policies 
yeltsin dismissed rumors of a conspiracy by rightwing lawmakers 
to remove reformists from gorbachevs government 
this is an invention aimed at aggravating the situation as to 
make strong presidential power a necessity this is the only thing 
the kremlin can do to set things in order he said according 
to tass 
gorbachev met with shevardnadze for two hours on friday 
reportedly to discuss some way of keeping his longtime ally in the 
government 
it was not known whether gorbachev intended to ask shevardnadze 
a respected diplomat and longtime ally in reform to continue as 
foreign minister or to take another post 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said shevardnadzes 
decision to quit was irreversible 
officials had no further information saturday about a possible 
replacement for shevardnadze presidential spokesman vitaly 
ignatenko said shevardnadze and gorbachev did not speak on 
saturday

thousands of albanians on saturday held 
the first legal opposition rally in decades cheering demands for 
the release of political prisoners and for more reform in the 
communist nation 
also saturday the countrys trade union declared independence 
from the communist party promising to fight for higher pay and 
better conditions for workers a union official said 
chants of freedom and democracy echoed from about 
12000 people gathered at the peaceful onehour rally in tirana 
the capital it was called by the democratic party of albania an 
opposition party legalized last week 
the boisterous crowd some waving albanias red flag with a 
oubleheaded eagle roared approval when opposition leaders 
demanded the release of political prisoners leaders also demanded 
freedom of worship 
the tiny balkan nation is the last in europe to be ruled by a 
stalinist regime on friday however communist leaders began 
dismantling the cult of stalinism ordering all statues and symbols 
bearing the soviet dictators name removed 
the communists promised a government change earlier this month 
but it is not clear how far albanian leaders are willing to go 
toward creating a true democracy 
albanias new opposition has encountered numerous obstacles 
opposition leaders say local communist officials still hinder 
activists traveling to provincial cities 
journalist lazar stani said after the rally that the communists 
had agreed to permit the appearance of an opposition newspaper 
twice a week a major opposition demand stani said the paper 
democratic renaissance would would be published this week there 
was no government confirmation that permission had been granted 
student protests over conditions in slumlike dormitories 
swelled two weeks ago into demands for democracy and helped force 
the ruling communists to permit other parties 
on saturday police sealed off side streets near the site of the 
rally but reporters saw no arrests or clashes between police and 
demonstrators 
three trucks with helmeted riot police swiftly appeared when 
chanting crowds leaving the rally site got to central skanderbeg 
square about a mile away but the demonstrators moved on when 
ordered to do so by police 
another police cordon guarded the giant statue of albanias 
stalinist founder enver hoxha which dominates the square 
opposition party leaders urged the cheering crowd at the rally 
to work peacefully for democracy 
violence and vengeance have scarred the history of europes most 
isolated and backward nation and the new opposition wants both to 
contain popular discontent and to avoid provoking a backlash from 
the communists 
the main message from the new party was that albanians who 
have known only feudalism or stalinist repression have nothing to 
fear from freedom 
economist gramoz pashko a founder of the opposition party 
assured albanians that they would not suffer in a gradual 
transition to market economy but would get the chance to own land 
and make money 
heart surgeon sali berisha another founder demanded the 
postponement of parliamentary elections from feb 10 to at least 
april the february date leaves the opposition little time to 
organize against the powerful communists 
state television briefly showed the rally on its evening news 
but gave a vague account of opposition demands 
also saturday the 850000member official trade union declared 
it would no longer act as the lever of the party said genc 
resuli head of the unions international department the break 
with the communists was approved by the unions 201member central 
committee he said 
the union also pledged to work for higher pay and better 
conditions including a cut in the working week from six to five 
days resuli said many albanians say rising food prices mean they 
are struggling to manage on wages averaging 50 a month 
in a development apparently related to efforts to improve the 
economy the state ata news agency reported the reshuffling of some 
posts including the ministries of transport and finance and the 
appointment of a new head of the albanian state bank

sleigh dashing through the snow but prince charles churned through 
the desert dust on a tank saturday bringing christmas cheer to 
british troops and us marines 
a herd of camels wandering along a nearby oil pipeline provided 
a biblical touch but there were no christmas trees in sight only 
clumps of scrub grass in the undulating sand 
for members of britains famed desert rats and half a dozen us 
marines however it was charles himself that made the christmas 
season special not the trappings 
it was thrilling said capt michael castagnero 34 of 
pitcairn pa who spent hours with his soldiers reading a people 
magazine article on protocol and practicing bowing their heads in 
preparation for the visit 
we have a lot in common because he was married the same month 
i was you watch how his marriage is unfolding the same as mine 
so its been kind of interesting he said 
but castagnero said that bowing didnt come easily for the 
marines who are coordinating us air and sea fire support for the 
british regiment 
its usually chest high head up he said with a laugh 
british lance cpl steve layland of liverpool who was a bit 
nervous about meeting royalty for the first time said the princes

ride through the desert on a challenger tank named churchill in 
honor of britains world war ii prime minister who fought with the 
irish hussars in the late 1890s 
the 42yearold heir to the british throne who only recently 
recovered from a serious double break in his right arm suffered in 
a polo accident jumped off the tank with ease and saluted denaro 
an old opponent on the polo field 
at least i climbed on without breaking the other arm charles 
joked about his tank ride i didnt drive it 
i can salute which is a great thing he added 
the prince then shook hands and chatted with several british 
tank crews and the marines asking about their nonalocholic 
christmas and the angloamerican language barrier 
denaro who laughingly noted that his army polo team had 
defeated charles on several occasions had a serious message for 
the prince 
were ready to go he said weve got some brigades fully 
up and running and a full brigade with a division coming in and 
theyll be ready too

improved transportation arrangements that allow jews to fly out of

drug traffickers saturday said the 
united states has no right to judge colombias government for 
allegedly taking a softer stance in its war on the cocaine trade 
the medellin cocaine cartel using its pseudonym the 
extraditables made its statements in a letter addressed to the 
us ambassador in colombia thomas mcnamara a copy of the letter 
was sent by fascimile mail to news organizations 
president carlos gavirias new strategy entails ending 
extraditions to the united states and giving reduced sentences to 
cocaine traffickers who surrender and confess on tuesday reputed 
medellin leader fabio ochoa surrendered to authorities 
us officials have expressed concern the new policy may hurt 
regional antidrug efforts and the traffickers letter was 
apparently in response to the us reaction 
the traffickers statement said the us officials are the 
only ones in the world who negotiate with drug traffickers the 
traffickers said while colombian drug offenders are given the 
harshest treatment in us jails some american smugglers serve no 
time 
the letter mentioned barry seal a us trafficker turned 
government informant as an example of an american criminal who 
never knew the jails of the united states 
after helping the drug enforcement administration indict several 
major cocaine traffickers seal was assassinated by the colombian 
drug mafia in 1986 
among those accused of having ordered his murder is ochoa 
drug bosses have said as many as 300 cocaine smugglers are 
willing to surrender in return for more legal guarantees 
thousands of colombians have died since august 1989 in 
drugrelated violence ranging from gunfights to bombings to 
political assassinations the killing that august of antidrug 
crusader luis galan a leading presidential contender prompted the 
governments war on drug traffickers 
the extraditables also criticized gavirias new drug strategy as 
part of a policy of repression against drug trafficking because 
it requires smugglers to confess crimes 
the drug barons say requiring citizens to incriminate themselves 
in court is unconstitutional 
gaviria in comments published saturday said his drug policy 
was not a deal with traffickers but an attempt to solve the drug 
problem within the framework of colombian justice 
we are as committed as we ever were to the fight against drug 
trafficking the washington post quoted gaviria as saying

about 1500 people jeered and threw things at 
six robed ku klux klan members who staged a rally downtown 
saturday resulting in one injury and seven arrests 
hecklers at fountain square shouted obscenities waved smash 
the klan signs and hurled bottles that shattered on the squares 
stage as helmeted police formed a barrier to hold back the crowd 
its a damn shame the citys protecting them one protester 
said 
police chief lawrence whalen said at least one fistfight broke 
out among people in the angry crowd that had gathered in the plaza 
where two months ago thousands had gathered to honor the world 
series champion cincinnati reds 
one fire captain was slightly injured by an object hurled from 
the crowd whalen said no other injuries were reported 
i think youve seen an exhibition here of one of the most 
difficult jobs that public safety has of maintaining strict 
neutrality between two or three or four factions that have some 
very significant points of view he said 
its one of the more serious demonstrations that weve had 
the klansmen wearing white purple and black robes erected a 
10foot cross in the square which was decorated with christmas 
trees one klan member held up a bible and yelled life life 
through jesus but when he grabbed a bullhorn to make a speech 
jeers and taunts drowned out his words 
one heckler in the crowd screamed your mama should see you 
she aint never bought you no clothes like that 
the jeering intensified when one klan member held up a sign 
reading fight racism abolish affirmative action 
it was getting ugly real quick said edward ammann the 
assistant police chief 
those who were arrested were charged with disorderly conduct 
other protesters angry over the arrests went to the hamilton 
county justice center and chanted while the seven were booked 
ammann said police recovered 40 to 50 objects the protesters 
threw during the rally including rocks ball bearings pieces of 
machinery and a twopound can of sliced pineapples 
the klansmen members of the us knights of the ku klux klan 
based in nearby hamilton had obtained a city permit to hold a 
onehour raly but left 15 minutes early 
police escorted them to a nearby building after they ended their 
event and used chemical mace to repel some protesters who had 
charged toward the klansmen 
one protester was arrested as he threw an object and hit a 
klansmans car as it sped away 
imperial wizard ron lee said he did not want any violence during 
the rally 
the klansmen observed a resolution the city council had passed 
wednesday barring them from wearing hoods to conceal their 
identities on public property the council citing the fear of 
violence in passing it 
the klan obtained the rally permit after us district judge 
carl rubin allowed a jewish congregation to put a menorah on the 
square for the eight days of hanukkah 
the city opposes religious symbols on the square and the the 
klan removed the cross after the event city officials cited safety 
concerns in denying the klan permission to burn the cross

raise their fears maybe unnecessarily

accident but said it is common for the navy to hire ferries in 
foreign ports he said the boats are inspected and sailors are

i think the circumstances were catastrophic and extremely 
quick there is a great concern about the people on the saratoga

times

france is asking unified germany for reparations 
from world war ii that the former east germany had balked at 
paying an official said saturday 
the official confirming a newspaper report said the move was 
in line with october unification of the two germanys which gives 
the united country the burden of various debts of the former east 
germany 
in paris an authorized source speaking on condition of 
anonymity also confirmed discussions were under way but stressed 
they involved claims from private citizens not french governmental 
claims 
die welt newspaper quoted reliable sources saying french 
diplomats had spoken several times with the foreign ministry in 
bonn about the issue and the french embassy in bonn had sent two 
written notes to the ministry 
a ministry spokesman who refused to be identified by name said 
the issue was a normal occurrence after unification about which 
there must be negotiations france had previously been in contact 
with east germany about reparations he said 
the die welt report said france had put its claim in the 
currencies of 1945 376 billion french francs and 261 billion 
reichsmarks the currency of nazi germany asked how the claims 
would be converted into todays money the spokesman said it was a 
technical question for negotiators 
in the west german currency reform of 1948 10 reichsmarks were 
converted to 1 mark at that rate the german currency part of the 
french claim would be set at 261 billion marks today worth about 
17 billion 
the french currency also has been reformed since the war data 
on its conversion were not available 
according to one estimate the final claim could rise over 65 
billion 
the spokesman said there would be talks early next year about 
the issue 
when the two germanys united in october the federal government 
assumed the debts and treaty obligations of east germany which 
unlike west germany had not paid reparations to the western allies 
after the war the big four allies the united states france 
britain and the soviet union assessed reparations against germany 
to be paid in assets and capital goods 
but germany was economically prostrate and collection of 
reparations was uneven at the same time the united states was 
pouring billions into west germany and other european countries in 
the marshall plan which helped revive wardamaged economies 
the london agreement of 1953 among west germany and the four 
allies permitted the reparations question to remain open until a 
final settlement of wartime issues which has finally happened in 
the past year with the unification of germany and the paris summit 
in november of 34 countries that sought to draw the final curtain 
over world war ii 
die welt said some of the damages france was claiming had 
occurred when frenchowned property was seized in the soviet 
occupation zone which became east germany other claims were 
related to forced labor by prisoners of war restitutions for 
seized jewelry and valuable objects die welt said 
in the mid1980s west germany agreed to pay damages to some 
french people who did forced labor or were drafted into the germany 
military 
germany is paying reparations to israel and individual jews for 
the holocaust that sum so far has totaled about 80 billion marks 
about 53 billion at todays exchange rates

of an empty prison and loosening chunks from the facade of a bank 
building a 1000footwide landslide block a road west from san 
jose

near the panamanian border about 125 miles south of san jose said 
bruce presgrave a geophysicist at the us geological surveys

university volcanic service put the epicenter at 27 miles west of 
san jose near the city of santiago puriscal

points across san jose christmas shoppers rushed into the streets 
some of them crying 
five homes were considerably damaged in the city of escazu on 
the outskirts of san jose radio reports said 
president rafael calderon called on citizens to remain calm

the island of 145000 residents on friday 
gov joseph ada on saturday sent a letter to president bush 
requesting a disaster declaration to release federal funds to help 
in the recovery 
a disaster declaration from bush is unlikely for several days 
said bart stinson a civil defense spokesman there was no 
immediate estimate of total damage he said 
electricity and water service had been restored to about 20 
percent of guam by sunday morning stinson said telephone service 
however remained intact because most of the cables are buried he 
said 
stinson said damage to guam community college which is adjacent 
to guam university was extensive 
it looks more like a tornado hit it than a typhoon he said 
the wooden buildings were splintered and desks strewn around the 
campus where trees were twisted and not just blown down he said 
ada said a preliminary survey by federal emergency management 
agency teams found 341 homes destroyed 460 with major damage and 
1210 with minor damage to the point they were uninhabitable 
hospitals reported treating 88 people mostly for punctures 
cuts and scratches from windblown debris 
the fema teams were already on guam when typhoon russ hit they 
had come to coordinate recovery operations on islands in the 
federated states of micronesia that were hit by typhoon owen three

iraq asked the world health organization 
on saturday to help free medicine and equipment to combat 
hepatitis which iraq claims contributed to the deaths of some 
children since un trade sanctions began 
the official iraqi news agency said a national committee against 
hepatitis sent a telegram saying the sanctions halted imports of 
the equipment and special tools to discover the hepatitis b virus 
and also the vaccine against it 
the report monitored in nicosia did not refer to a specific 
outbreak or epidemic but said the sickness is considered a big 
health problem in iraq especially among children 
without providing figures on hepatitis cases the report said 
the committee told officials at the genevabased un agency that 
2042 children under 5 years old have died since the embargo began 
in august iraq blamed the deaths on shortages of baby food and 
medicine and claimed many of those who died suffered from 
hepatitis 
the embargo is meant to retaliate for iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
hepatitis b is one of five strains of the blood virus that can 
be prevented by vaccine serious cases of hepatitis can lead to 
liver problems 
the committee called in the telegram on the world health 
organization to interfere immediately to release the food and 
medicine seige and release imported medicine vaccine equipment 
and tools to control the hepititis virus in iraq the news agency 
said 
western diplomats in baghdad say iraq has received 120 tons of 
medicine from humanitarian groups worldwide since midoctober most 
of the shipments were in exchange for western hostages trapped by 
the persian gulf crisis president saddam hussein decided dec 6 to 
free all foreigners 
iraqs red crescent the islamic equivalent of the red cross 
announced recently it had received 22 tons of medical supplies from 
italy and another 28 tons from the un childrens fund 
but irqai officials have said acute shortages exist in some 
areas such as for polio vaccine and drugs to treat heart ailments

the united nations halted deliveries of 
humanitarian aid in angola after its leftist government blocked 
food convoys headed to rebelheld areas a portuguese report said 
the cutoff jeopardizes aid for some of the estimated two million 
people facing starvation in the southern african nation a severe 
drought this year destroyed many crops 
we suspended all activities in the country because otherwise 
there would be violation of the principles of neutrality and 
equality the lusa news agency quoted un representative in 
angola otto essian as saying its report was carried late friday 
night 
the united nations started aid shipments to angola seven weeks 
ago it aimed to distribute 130 million tons of food over six 
months to hungry angolans who have suffered during 15 years of 
civil war 
according to lusa angolas minister of planning told essian 
that food deliveries in rebelcontrolled territories must stop 
immediately 
the minister justified the decision saying military action by 
usbacked unita rebels had slowed down food convoys in areas 
under government control he said the rebels had blown up an 
important bridge that linked the towns of lubango and caconda in 
the southern province of huila 
unita the national union for the total liberation of angola 
has been fighting to force the sovietbacked government to share 
control since independence from portugal in 1975 
the two sides agreed to open peace corridors to allow 
international organizations to deliver food medicine and clothes 
to half of angolas 18 provinces but they have continued fighting 
the civil war has devastated angolas mineralrich economy and 
killed over 350000 people according to government figures 
after talks in washington dec 13 the warring sides agreed to 
set a date for free elections and then sign a ceasefire 
however the rebels accused the government saturday of 
undermining the next round of talks scheduled for early next year 
by making unreasonable demands lusa reported citing a unita 
statement monitored in lisbon

the philadelphia inquirer apologized 
publicly saturday for an editorial that had been attacked as racist 
because it linked a new contraceptive to efforts to reverse 
poverty 
the editorial appeared in the newspapers early sunday edition 
which went on sale saturday morning 
the newspaper took the unusual step in response to criticism of 
a dec 12 editorial that suggested the contraceptive norplant 
recently approved by the federal government could help solve the 
problem of poverty among blacks 
the earlier norplant editorial undercut our credibility and 
our efforts to be a thoughtful responsible and compassionate voice 
on the complex issues of poverty the newspaper said in its lead 
editorial in sunday editions we apologize to those we hurt and 
offended 
the apology noted the newspapers own reporters editors and 
editorial board members were among those incensed by the original 
editorial it was printed alongside five letters to the editor 
containing both praise and criticism 
the original editorial discussed two stories in the previous 
days newspaper one was about norplant which prevents pregnancy 
through implants of tiny rods under the skin and stays effective 
for years the other about a research finding that nearly half of 
black children live in poverty and the situation is growing worse 
as we read those two stories we asked ourselves dare we 
mention them in the same breath to do so might be considered 
deplorably insensitive perhaps raising the specter of eugenics 
but it would be worse to avoid drawing the logical conclusion that 
foolproof contraception could be invaluable in breaking the cycle 
of inner city poverty one of americas greatest challenges the 
original editorial said 
the editorial written by deputy editorial page editor donald 
kimelman acknowledged better prenatal care and better schools as 
possible solutions to the problem 
but it also said its very tough to undo the damage of being 
born into a dysfunctional family so why not make a major effort to 
reduce the number of children of any race born into such 
circumstances 
the newspaper said reliable birth control should be a matter of 
personal choice and should be as available to poor women who want 
to use it as to middleclass women 
in linking the issues of race and contraception we left too 
many people with the impression that our cure for poverty was to 
reduce the number of black people the apology said that 
conclusion certainly was not what we meant to suggest it said

a homeless rights group said saturday it has 
settled a copyright dispute with the creator of a contemporary 
nativity scene depicting a family huddled over a streetside 
steam grate 
the community for creative nonviolence which was founded by 
the late mitch snyder said us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson approved an agreement last week giving joint copyright 
interests to both ccnv and sculptor james earl reid 
the agreement gives ccnv the right to make twodimensional 
copies such as christmas cards and posters of the statue entitled 
third world america 
reid retains the right to make both two and threedimensional 
copies of the sculpture the ccnv said 
the settlement requires the baltimore sculptor to advise people 
who buy his copies that the sales will not benefit ccnv 
were pleased that this chapter of litigation has finally come 
to a conclusion and are happy with the settlement ccnv 
spokeswoman carol fennelly said in a prepared statement 
reid said he is pleased with the settlement but remains 
concerned because he wants access to his original sculpture in the 
ccnv shelter 
another case is pending in which reid is trying to remove that 
sculpture from the shelter for several months while a master mold 
is made 
the master mold would allow reid to reproduce the work and 
protect it reid said that the sculpture in the ccnv shelter is a 
synthetic cementlike substance that is brittle reid wants to 
reproduce it in bronze 
being against my having access to my work is contrary to the 
spirit of public art said reid the work is for the public 
good its not just to lay in their shelter 
the statue unveiled on the ellipse near the washington monument 
on christmas eve 1985 was commissioned by ccnv which was headed 
by snyder a nationally known advocate for the homeless who earlier 
this year committed suicide 
reid donated his time to complete the statue but the group paid 
him 15000 for expenses incurred in creating it as a result ccnv 
owned the statue itself and that was never questioned 
however reid registered the copyright for the statue under his 
name after ccnv planned a multicity tour to raise money for the 
homeless 
ccnv then filed suit claiming exclusive copyright ownership 
in march 1989 the supreme court ruled that ccnv didnt own the 
copyright and returned the case to jackson

investigators searched saturday for clues 
as to why a chartered ferry capsized in choppy seas killing at 
least 19 american sailors who were in the middle east as part of 
operation desert shield 
survivors said the israeli ferry went under almost instantly 
after it was swamped early saturday while ferrying about 100 
crewmen back to the aircraft carrier uss saratoga from shore leave 
in haifa 
all of a sudden i saw water just come flying in it was maybe 
two seconds and the boat rolled right over said chief petty 
officer lance vickery 33 of jacksonville fla 
israeli divers retrieved six bodies from the sunken craft in 65 
feet of water the others were found dead on the surface or died of 
injuries after being rescued alive officials said three dozen 
sailors were taken to hospitals but most were released 
by saturday afternoon two men were still reported unaccounted 
for but navy officials said they believed they would be located as 
crewmen reported back to their ships 
the saratoga and its three escort ships were in the red sea as 
part of the naval buildup in the persian gulf region in the wake of 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the accident was the deadliest involving us servicemen in 
operation desert shield and it raised the number of americans who 
have died to at least 73 
haifa is a frequent port of call for american sailors last 
year more than 45000 sailors attached to the sixth fleet visited 
the northern port city 
several sailors rescued from the tuvia said the craft may have 
been overloaded one of the two israeli crewmen yossi shochat 
said he believed too many sailors were crowded into the boats 
stern 
but gen micha ram the commander of israels navy said on 
israel radio that the tuvia had been licensed to carry 130 
passengers but took only about 100 because the seas were running 
high 
until the boat is retrieved and can be examined we cannot 
point to any negligence he said 
he said the craft went down in 15 or 20 seconds and added i 
have never known a vessel to sink so fast 
survivors told of harrowing moments in the water clinging to 
life jackets and debris from the 57footlong doubledeck ferry 
at least some of the injured were struck by a rescue boat 
six of the injured remained in haifas rambam hospital on 
saturday night matty ilnach head duty nurse at rambam said all 
were listed as slightly wounded and could be released sunday 
cmdr craig quigley a us navy spokesman said 36 sailors were 
admitted to haifa hospitals but that most were released immediately 
after a checkup 
col ranaan gissen the israeli armys deputy spokesman said 
more than 30 others were plucked from the waters unharmed in a 
rescue operation by both us and israeli forces 
flares lit the sky over the harbor of the northern city for much 
of the night and ambulances rushed victims to three haifaarea 
hospitals 
some sailors rescued from the capsized ferry said they had spent 
their shore leave having dinner drinking beer or visiting 
discotheques 
israel army radio reported that some of the sailors had been 
drunk and at least one of the dead victims was handcuffed 
apparently after being arrested by us military police for 
drunkenness 
however pentagon spokesman lt commander alan dooley said no 
one aboard the boat was in handcuffs 
the tuvia capsized shortly after midnight about 200 yards from 
the saratoga which was anchored outside the harbors breakwater 
about a mile offshore the waves were reported at three to four 
feet and winds at 35 mph when the craft heeled over 
quigley said i would point out that the operation of the boat 
was completely separate from navy operations there was an 
israeli master and crewman the sailors were passengers 
quigley said all 1920 sailors who began liberty friday were 
ordered to return to the carrier and three escort ships to try to 
account for all sailors 
the saratoga task force based at mayport naval air station in 
jacksonville fla includes the destroyer sampson cruiser south 
carolina and combat stores ship sirius it has 6200 men including 
about 4500 aboard the saratoga 
the saratoga naval task force arrived in haifa on thursday night 
from the red sea 
quigley said bodies of the victims would probably be flown back 
to the united states starting sunday 
gissen said police and port officials were conducting two 
separate investigations into the cause of the sinking the navy 
also ordered a probe of the accident 
seaman michael benjamin 19 of san antonio texas said he was 
standing in the ferrys aft when he saw water pouring in as the 
craft bounced over the waves 
we were going on the waves and i just noticed one that was 
bigger than normal and then we noticed another one that was bigger 
than normal the next thing i know all i saw coming in was water 
i was tilted forward i heard a lot of yelling shes going 
down 
benjamin suffered a neck injury when he was hit in the water by 
one of the rescue boats

republics two bombings were reported in other troubled areas 
ethnic tension and struggles against the kremlin have dominated 
recent events in the 15 soviet republics which have all declared 
some form of independence or autonomy 
gorbachev gave moldavia 10 days to dissolve a new national guard 
and guarantee equal rights for all ethnic groups four people were 
killed in the southern republic last month when government troops 
clashed with activists seeking independence from the soviet union 
gorbachev also asked moldavia to reconsider a law making 
moldavian the republics official language 
language is among issues cited by the two ethnic groups seeking 
their own republics 
the gagauz comprising about 150000 turkish christians 
declared a new republic in southern moldavia in eastern moldavia 
more than 300000 ethnic russians and ukrainians have joined to 
declare a new republic along the dneister river 
they all resent the moldavianlanguage law and requirements that 
people in dozens of jobs pass moldavian language tests by 1995 
moldavian spoken by about twothirds of the republics people is 
identical to romanian except for the cyrillic script 
gorbachev said the declaration of the new republics was illegal 
under the soviet and moldavian constitutions 
the moldavian legislature has clamped a twomonth state of 
emergency on the gagauz region restricting movement in and out of 
the area and banning public rallies 
in latvia a bomb exploded in a military school in the capital 
of riga late saturday breaking 200 windows and causing 80000

the christmas tree in the lobby of the city 
board of pensions and retirement had just one giftwrapped box 
under it last week 
it had an opening like a coin slot in the top and it was empty 
retired and current employees fear thats what their pension 
fund will look like if the fund loans money to aid the cashstarved 
city 
the administration of mayor w wilson goode has tried since 
august to borrow enough money to meet expenses through winter 
payless paydays for city workers are likely next month without a 
cash infusion 
a 375 million offering of shortterm notes failed in september 
the city is negotiating with banks the city pension board and the 
state public school employees retirement board over the terms of a 
150 million note issue 
the decision on the note issue was put off last week until after 
christmas or possibly the new year 
the money would allow the city to pay its workers and meet 
debtservice payment but not to pay suppliers already owed 
millions of dollars goode said friday night 150 million is 
better than zero 
potential investors and city officials reported progress on loan 
terms after five hours of closeddoor negotiations friday banks 
have demanded an array of guarantees aimed at ensuring repayment to 
investors and a cure to city deficits projected to exceed 500 
million over the next 18 months 
a bank proposal for an outside authority with lineitem veto 
power over the city budget was scuttled goode said 
but a financial control element remains in the package city 
controller jonathan a saidel said its makeup would be determined 
by the state legislature he said declining to give further 
details 
goode saidel and other democratic leaders in a fiscal recovery 
plan announced nov 9 suggested an independent control board be 
created the boardw authority would be triggered if the city 
passed an unrealistically balanced budget 
in the loan package being negotiated each of the two pension 
boards would buy up to 25 percent of the total amount or 375 
million of a 150 million deal the other 75 million would be 
purchased by the banks 
the notes are expected to pay about 105 percent taxexempt 
interest nearly twice the going rate on notes offered by 
governments with solid credit ratings philadelphias rating has 
sunk this year to junkbond level the lowest among major us 
cities 
the city pension boards investment is far from certain no vote 
will be taken until a consultant advises board members on the 
prudence of such an investment the consultants report is not 
expected until negotiations produce a final loan package possibly 
late this week 
the consultants report will be weighed against the sentiments 
of those who depend on the pension fund for retirement income 
my members both active and pension dont want us to do it 
period said john a reilly a firefighters union representative 
on the board 
but joseph herkness a whitecollar union leader on the board 
said it may be necessary to find a way thats palatable to pension 
fund members if payrolls are missed so are payments to the 
pension plan he said 
we will consider all options when were talking about a public 
bankruptcy especially when our contributions to this fund are in 
danger herkness said 
the state teachers pension board recessed a dec 14 meeting so 
it could reconvene on short notice to consider an investment

for one pair of brothersinlaw it 
isnt really christmas until one sends the other ivan the 
same greeting card they have exchanged every yule season for 42 
years 
the tradition began in 1948 when irving willis mailed the 
unsigned card to his wifes brother delbert gibson 
although the two men were living in the same house in 
washington dc i knew who it was that sent it right away 
said gibson now 83 it was his kind of humor 
so i kept the card and the next year sent it back to him 
with a russian christmas greeting said gibson a professional 
linguist who now lives in fort lauderdale 
because the guy on the cover is riding a russian sled i 
picked russian and we named the card ivan then he sent it back to 
me the following year and it soon became a tradition 
every year since the greeting has been written in a different 
language except for two years the men unwittingly wrote in 
dialects of two languages that already had been used 
when gibson received the card this year he found the greeting 
krismasi njema merry christmas in luo an african 
language 
i live in a retirement home and one of the men that works 
here is from kenya said willis 79 a retired navy captain now 
making his home in washington 
now the men are beginning to run out of languages for their 
annual holiday greeting the two used up more common languages such 
as french dutch and italian the first few years 
the card also is running out of blank space for future 
greetings 
we would have to write on the front said gibson and i 
dont think we want to do that

cambodias four warring factions said sunday they 
have agreed on most key elements of a un peace plan but they 
ended their round of talks without a final accord 
the outcome of the twoday paris talks fell short of the 
objective set by france and indonesia cochairmen of the 
conference to secure total agreement to the proposal however the 
participants said the paris peace conference would reconvene at 
an early date 
a final communique by the supreme national council made up of 
the warring groups said early sunday there was agreement on most 
of the fundamental points of the unsponsored plan but it 
added there were outstanding questions 
these questions should be discussed within the 12member council 
and by the coordinating committee of the paris conference which is 
the framework for signing an overall peace settlement to end more 
than a decade of civil war in the southeast asian country 
the un plan was agreed to nov 26 by the united states and the 
four other permanent members of the security council it calls for 
the united nations to administer cambodia during an interim period 
leading to free elections while the supreme national council acts 
as titular head it also calls for a ceasefire and disarming of 
all four parties 
the heads of all the resistance factions voiced their acceptance 
without reserve of the plan and called on the phnom penh 
government to accept it the resistance representatives were prince 
norodom ranariddh heading the delegation of rebel coalition leader 
prince norodom son sann and khieu samphan leader of the 
communist khmer rouge 
the government of prime minister hun sen was the only one of the 
four cambodian factions to object to key aspects of the un 
proposal according to informed sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
a senior western official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said phnom penh is concerned about the extent to which its 
government could be dismantled by the plan and about the extent of 
disarmament 
hun sen said on his arrival here that serious measures must be 
taken to suppress the foundations of the khmer rouge the 
strongest member of the threeparty resistance coalition 
the khmer rouges threeyear reign as cambodias government 
which ended in 1979 with a vietnamese invasion left hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians dead from executions famine and civil 
unrest

a government official said saturday that 
evidence indicates some german firms planned to ship goods to iraq 
in violation of a un trade embargo 
volker franzen spokesman for the economics ministry said the 
evidence suggests a few firms were involved but no proof has 
been found that german goods illegally landed in iraq he did not 
name the companies or give other details 
the united nations placed the embargo on iraq following the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait 
franzen said german officials have been studying a list compiled 
by us officials of 50 german firms suspected of breaking the 
embargo 
der spiegel magazine has reported two german companies may have 
helped iraq in the production of nerve gas the magazine also 
alleged interatom gave iraq sensitive nuclear training and 
equipment 
interatom and its owner the giant electronics conglomerate 
siemens denied the magazines report interatom specializes in 
atomic energy plant construction and uranium enrichment but is 
also involved in nonnuclear engineering 
franzen said the information from the us list is of varying 
quality and some firms are included which are completely above 
suspicion but he said in other cases further investigation is 
needed 
if german firms are found to have violated the embargo they 
could face charges in germany of breaking the countrys export 
laws 
der spiegel magazine said the list of alleged german 
embargobusters resulted from us monitoring of iraqi telephone 
and telefax communications 
us officials are informed of iraqs supply plans because 
american intelligence listens in on iraqs overall telephone 
traffic and intercepts telefax messages the magazine said 
without identifying its sources 
in another export scandal in 1988 us intelligence said german 
companies helped libya build a factory allegedly for making 
chemical weapons the german government at first rejected the 
allegations but later acknowledged they were true 
as a result of that scandal the head of a german chemical firm 
was convicted of breaking the countrys export laws

us oil companies have been authorized to 
import limited amounts of oil from iran and send their payments to 
an escrow fund established to pay claims won against the iranian 
government by americans 
the imports to be handled on a casebycase basis were 
authorized by president bush in early november according to state 
department officials they are covered by 1987 treasury regulations 
setting up a mechanism for commercial deals with iran 
the payments go into an escrow account overseen by the iranus 
claims tribunal an organization set up in the hague in 1981 to 
arbitrate commercial disputes between us claimants and the 
iranian government 
last month we decided to license the import of iranian oil 
into the united states on a casebycase basis where the proceeds 
of the transaction are to be deposited in the security account 
state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty confirmed saturday 
night 
if such transactions occur this will help ensure that there 
are adequate funds available to pay tribunal awards to us 
claimants to date over 2 billion has been transferred from the 
security account in satisfaction of tribunal awards to us 
claimants 
addition of oil to items that can be imported from iran on a 
casebycase basis was reported initially by platts week an oil 
industry newsletter and subsequently by the new york times 
state department officials said the main reason for allowing oil 
imports was to help keep the escrow account funded but they 
acknowledged that the move creates an additional oil supply in the 
event that a war in the middle east results in a shortage

stanford university under fire for 
claiming faculty discounts on game tickets are researchrelated 
expenses has agreed to temporarily cut its billing rate to the 
government by 2 percent 
the decrease is part of a provisional agreement drafted 
during talks last week between stanford administrators and a team 
of contract experts and administrators from the office of naval 
research one of three federal agencies investigating stanfords 
billing of research overhead costs 
the navy is looking into claims that the school may have 
overbilled the government as much as 200 million in the past 
decade 
the interim agreement permits business relationships to be put 
on an orderly basis while the investigations continue said 
stanford spokesman larry horton 
stanford was charging the government 74 percent above the cost 
of a research contract to pay for overhead costs 
overhead costs include electricity bills building depreciation 
administrative expenses and the use of campus libraries and other 
facilities by researchers under government contract the government 
allows those expenses 
but stanford also contends that fringe benefits for its faculty 
such as discounts on football and basketball tickets swimming 
pools tennis courts and gyms are ordinary costs of doing business 
and includes them in research overhead charges 
under the temporary contract the university will be reimbursed 
at 72 percent until june 1991 when the navy investigation is 
expected to be completed 
based on what the probes find the billing rate may change 
in exchange for stanfords temporary billing rate pullback the 
head of the fivemember navy team approved payment of 38 million 
in research bills that the office of naval research had refused to 
release since october 
stanford also agreed to reopen talks on memorandums of 
understanding that have guided its billing practices for 
government research during the past 30 years some government 
officials say the rates set in the documents may have unduly 
benefited stanford at the expense of taxpayers

the security council voted saturday to 
dissolve a 43yearold un trusteeship over several pacific island 
chains that were once a stage for cold war rivalries 
the end of un authority over the northern marianas marshall 
islands and federated states of micronesia in the western pacific 
leaves palau as the only remaining part of the trust territory 
palau continues under us administration 
the vote followed us assurances it would not expand military 
bases or presence in the region which had once been considered 
crucial for the star wars missile defense program 
cuba one of the 15 security council members cast the only vote 
in opposition to ending the trusteeship cuban diplomats cited 
objections by some island residents who complained about us 
administration and alleged military objectives in the region 
the soviet union had for years criticized the united states as 
the islands administering authority claiming it bullied the island 
residents and sought to establish a militarystrategic beachhead in 
the pacific 
but dramatically improved ussoviet relations appear to have 
resolved the differences 
former president reagan had said the us armys kwajalein 
missile testing range in the marshall islands was vital to our 
strategic defense initiative also known as star wars 
however us ambassador thomas r pickering said the us 
government had no intention of expanding the size or number of 
military installations on the islands 
the marshall islands and the federated states had argued that 
elimination of the un trusteeship would make it easier for them 
to establish diplomatic and economic relations with other states 
especially britain and european nations 
but the northern mariana islands governor wrote the security 
council asking that the islands remain under the trusteeship 
the northern marianas are a us commonwealth the marshalls and 
federated states of micronesia are semiindependent republics 
the trust territory of the pacific islands was established in 
1947 one of 11 trusteeships established by the united nations 
the region includes about 200000 people scattered among more 
than 2100 islands and atolls it covers nearly 3 million square 
miles of the pacific ocean slightly larger than the continental 
united states the islands represent a land area only half the size 
of rhode island
