commuters are sharing rides to work travelers are 
shortening their vacations homeowners are switching from oil to 
gas 
with the persian gulf crisis three months old and winter 
approaching northeastern consumers are trying to cut costs as fuel 
prices climb 
people are concerned said dave goodsell a marketing 
specialist with the nonprofit caravan for commuters which 
provides free information for massachusetts residents seeking to 
form van pools they are ready to make a change because they want 
to save money 
caravan had 700 phone calls a 46 percent increase to its 
information line in august the first month of the fuel crunch 
goodsell said he expects similar increases for september and 
october when those numbers are tabulated 
at the rideshare co in hartford conn inquiries from people 
seeking car pool information increased 15 percent over this time 
last year said byron l york vice president of marketing 
many travel agents report customers are shaving days off trips 
and looking even harder for bargains 
one thing weve noticed in the last 10 years is vacations are 
no longer considered a luxury said art kinsman a manager at the 
american automobile association he said he has seen many travelers 
shorten trips and choose domestic rather than international 
destinations 
and when people are at home theyre also looking to save money 
our companies are receiving double triple and in some cases 
tenfold increases in requests for information about customer 
conversions from oil to gas heat said thomas kiley president of 
the new england gas association the interest has mushroomed and 
it can be targeted right back to the events of the middle east 
the association represents 26 gas distributors in six new 
england states they serve more than 2 million customers 
michael netkovick spokesman for energy north in manchester 
nh which supplies 80 percent of the natural gas in that state 
said business has been up since august with at least 200 customers 
converting to natural gas from oil 
laurie hanson a spokeswoman for con edison in new york said 
the number of conversion requests from august to october doubled 
over the same period in 1989 
in new jersey public service electric amp gas co said about 
3600 consumers had switched from oil to gas a 12 percent increase 
over last year 
we generally do get more interest in the fall said pseampg 
spokeswoman priscilla suber but the interest were seeing now is 
spectacular 
homeowners requesting free energy audits are up 100 percent to 
200 percent in massachusetts said rachel shimshak policy director 
of the states energy office in an audit an expert surveys a home 
and offer moneysaving tips 
that tells me people are really concerned about home heating 
costs and taking steps to try to save money and energy now and 
guard themselves against future volatility shimshak said

locals at the triple r bar set aside football 
and billiards for a sport with true grit beltsander racing 
nine competitors and 50 spectators showed up at the biker bar 
sunday for the fall national tournament of the sport that turns 
ordinary power tools into lean mean racing machines winners 
received tshirts and trophies 
bored contractors need something to do said dana mad 
dog mclean explaining the appeal of the pastime popular among 
carpenters and motorcyclists 
during a race sanders zoom sidebyside down a waisthigh 
24footlong plywood track divided into two lanes with electrical 
cords draped over the tracks side walls the sanders fly to the 
finish and slam into footthick foam pads 
some of the machines have been clocked at 3 to 3 seconds said 
race organizer karl grose 
despite safety warnings by woodworking teachers and power tool 
manufacturers racers insist their sport poses little danger 
no accidents have been reported but the track is sometimes 
showered with sparks when an electrical cord becomes separated from 
its speeding sander 
beltsander racing was introduced to maine after triple r 
coowner keith murphy saw it on television about five years ago 
it was from a bar in california just a fiveminute clip and 
i thought weve got to try this some time he said 
murphy and his friends built a track and word of the sport 
spread 
evidently there are little pockets of racers all over the 
country and were starting to find out about each other grose 
said 
racers debate the merits of makita black amp decker or 
portercable much like stock car crews argue the performance of 
fords and chevys others tinker with their sanders in hopes of 
making them a fraction of a second faster 
a stock craftsman right out of the box said mclean 
pointing to his racing machine 
racers also are of two minds on the fastest sandpaper some 
prefer coarse for a firmer bite others say finer grit provides 
more surface contact 
beltsander racing rules were lax in the sports early days 
it was no holds barred cheating was encouraged you could 
reach out and cut the other guys cord grose said 
now we modified it to one rule you cant mess with the 
other guys sander otherwise he said were pretty much 
winging it

in germany ricky morrows plight is the stuff of 
passionate demonstrations and letterwriting campaigns 
but in dallas where he is awaiting the start thursday of his 
third murder trial for a killing he admits to committing most 
people dont even know his name 
morrow is being tried on capital murder charges in the january 
1982 death of a security guard he says the shooting occurred 
accidentally while he was trying to rob first texas savings and 
loan 
im not innocent of a crime im innocent of capital murder 
he says from his jail cell in dallas under texas law a killing 
during the commission of a felony can bring the death penalty 
we are trying to do everything on our side to save ricky 
says eva marie kaifenheim of munich germany who has orchestrated 
a letterwriting campaign that has resulted in more than 200 notes 
to members of the us news media officials and diplomats the 
letters accuse prosecutors of acting improperly in morrows case 
ms kaifenheim said she learned of the case through the human 
rights organization amnesty international which employs her sister 
and other family members 
last year more than 500 demonstrators marched through the 
bavarian capital bearing placards saying life for ricky 
morrow ms kaifenheim said 
there are a lot of people here in munich aware of wha is 
going on in dallas she said 
morrows initial november 1983 capital murder conviction in the 
death of mark frazier was overturned by the texas court of criminal 
appeals in march 1988 because of an improper question posed to 
prospective jurors a second trial ended in a mistrial in july 
1989 
it was a complete accident something i never intended to 
happen morrow said of the shooting i was drunk i was on 
psychiatric medication i had just been released from a hospital 
seven days before 
in my own mind i do not think that it would be any more wrong 
for me to die than it was for him he should be living today 
and would be living today had i not gone out and got drunk and 
decided to rob a bank but i did and it happened 
but he questions the zeal with which he is being prosecuted 
noting that dallas county prosecutors have never lost a capital 
case since the death penalty was reinstituted in 1976 
theres a reason they have never lost one morrow said 
they will do anything 
theyre spending millions and millions of dollars just to get 
a notch on their belt thats what capital cases in dallas county 
are all about 
chief assistant district attorney norman kinne confirms that his 
office has won all 49 capital murder cases tried since 1976 
morrow 39 of houston and ms kaifenheim contend the district 
attorneys office has resorted to perjured testimony intimidation 
of potential witnesses and other unethical acts to ensure the death 
penalty 
ms kaifenheim rattles off the names of wrongfully convicted 
inmates randall dale adams and lenell geter who were freed by the 
courts amid allegations of misconduct by dallas county prosecutors 
morrow said prosecutors refused a plea bargain that would have 
kept him behind bars without possibility for parole until the age 
of 70 
assistant district attorney dan hagood who is prosecuting 
morrow declined to respond to the allegations 
i cant talk about a pending case ethically you are not 
supposed to he said but he confirmed his office has received 
letters from the germans 
morrows attorney keith jagmin also declined to discuss the 
trial which started in july with jury selection 
ms kaifenheim said she obtained the name of morrow who then 
was on texas death row and that of another death row inmate in 
1987 from her sister antonie who works with amnesty 
international 
the human rights organization unconditionally opposes the death 
penalty said alli miller amnesty international usas director of 
programs against the death penalty 
amnesty members in one country are asked to adopt another 
country in this instance germany has adopted the united 
states and protests us death penalty cases ms miller said 
but the action undertaken by ms kaifenheim was at her own 
behest not the groups she said amnesty international does not 
become involved with capital cases until the defendant has been 
sentenced 
after obtaining morrows name and address ms kaifenheim sent 
him a letter and a fruitcake for christmas in 1987 
ricky wrote me saying he was very happy for the cake but even 
happier by the letter she said in a telephone interview from 
munich conducted in german 
she had also sent some other inmate the same thing and he 
never responded i did respond because it was something you dont 
get in prison and i was moved by it morrow said 
that initial contact sparked a correspondence that has 
intensified over the years ms kaifenheim said that during a bleak 
period a year or so ago when morrow tried to take his own life she 
wrote him daily to boost his spirits 
she plans on coming to dallas when the trial begins 
i will be in court each day she said 
morrow said ms kaifenheims concern renewed his interest in 
fighting for what he calls a fair trial 
her primary concern is the same as mine that i get a fair 
trial and thats all im asking for he said

on weekends by the red sea women in 
headtotoe black shrouds picnic discreetly beneath umbrellas 
these days however some prefer bare knees as they blast along on 
jet skis 
times are changing for saudi women but those who will speak out 
on the subject disagree sharply over how much and how fast the 
persian gulf crisis most say is accelerating a process already 
under way 
weve been spoiled with an easy life and never thought about 
independence said faiza ambah a saudi reporter for the arab 
news if war breaks out we are going to have to depend on 
ourselves 
she shares a newsroom with men but covers her hair and clothes 
with black wraps her bookshelf contains danielle steeles 
changes but she is careful to note she brought it in for a 
friend 
in saudi arabia women have equal rights but far fewer 
privileges than men they cannot drive or expose their skin to 
public view they can work but with rare exceptions not around 
men 
men and women together in cars on the street or in 
restaurants must be married dating and parties are strictly 
chaperoned and only take place behind the walls of private homes 
transgressors risk at least a rap on the arm from an islamic 
vice squad if not a term in jail 
women began school only in the early 1960s when saudi arabia 
also abolished slavery 
you can imagine the pressure said an egyptian diplomat who 
knows saudi arabia girls come home from berkeley with a drivers 
license and a degree and cower from some old man with a stick 
well before the gulf crisis major shifts were under way women 
nurses were allowed to work with men doctors in hospitals now half 
the medical students in jiddah are women 
years ago some banks opened allwomen branches now there are 
banks operated by women that lend money at a burgeoning pace to 
women who are opening shops cooperatives and small businesses 
when us troops arrived a favorite topic was all the women in 
uniform liberated professionals who slung rifles over their 
shoulders manhandled heavy trucks and barked orders at men 
but foreign troops have been kept out of sight and women 
soldiers wear modest civilian dress when they have to appear among 
saudis 
more visible are nearly 100000 kuwaiti women traditionally far 
freer and more outspoken as refugees some attempt to observe 
local customs but their attitudes are not masked by veils 
opinions vary widely over the weight of these outside forces 
anything is possible as long as it is done discreetly said 
a saudia airlines stewardess explaining how women forbidden to 
drive can frolic on jet skis in prohibited swimwear the 
religious police dont go out on the water 
a young hospital worker educated in the liberal climate of 
egypt wears eyepopping bodices under her black abaya on the rare 
occasions she gets out at night for dinner with friends 
i dont think things will change much she said clearly 
distressed at the thought the saudis are used to it and they 
like it 
but rabaa alkhateeb who teaches shakespeare at jiddahs abdul 
aziz university argued in a groundbreaking article for the arab 
news that it was time to rethink the role of saudi women 
she wrote that saudi arabia could not continue suppressing the 
talents and stifling the abilities of onehalf the society with 
or without a crisis she said saudi arabia will have to employ its 
women to develop and thrive 
later in an interview she took pains to assure that she was 
not urging fullblown womens liberation we accept that we are 
different here she said this is our way of life 
she said most saudi women believed that restrictions on their 
activities reflected a male desire to protect them rather than to 
keep them in an inferior role 
nihal alomari a westerneducated journalist works with the 
nahdha philanthropic society in riyadh which marshals women 
volunteers for health and social services 
she sees important recent strides but a long road ahead all 
the changes that have been happening lately she said all 
could go back to before 
even among the younger generation pressure for immediate change 
is cautious often muted and expectations are few 
we feel safe here taken care of said aisha one of eight 
young women mostly students who gathered at a private home to 
tell an american reporter how they looked at their future 
aisha raised in detroit by saudi parents returned only three 
years ago but settled into the lifestyle of jiddah although she 
still visits the united states she prefers saudi arabia 
she said she was comfortable with a system where fathers and 
brothers had a say in whom she married and forbid westernstyle 
dating her father has two wives and she thought that worked well 
its better than fornification she said looking around to 
see if that was the word she meant a friend corrected her 
adultery 
but leena also educated in america wanted more job openings 
for women a greater say in how she shaped her life and like most 
saudi women interviewed she wanted to drive 
the crisis will make the process quicker she said it has 
opened things up 
asked about priorities one woman said freedom of speech 
would be nice dont quote me 
after an hours debate most agreed they were content but would 
welcome change 
leena explained we want to take some of the best you have in 
the west your way of thinking but with the protection and 
stability of our way of life 
aisha said our rulers do what is right i just wish they 
would do it a bit faster

by opening the door of reform just a 
crack albanias communist leaders have stirred hopes for change 
that ultimately may bring them down 
for many albanians and foreign observers the only questions are 
when and whether the fall will be slow or sudden peaceful or 
violent 
scores of foreign reporters were in tirana for an international 
conference last month and albanians of all ages reached out to the 
visitors with a thirst for freedom and friendship 
it was the latest stage of a process that began in may when the 
government promised reform 
two months later thousands of albanians clambered into foreign 
embassies demanding and receiving the right to emigrate 
president ramiz alia and the secretive elite that runs albania 
pulled back from reform conflicting articles in the official media 
suggested a conflict between conservatives and liberals in 
intellectual party and government ranks 
just after the gathering of balkan foreign ministers albanias 
first international conference another blow fell the defection of 
ismail kadare the countrys greatest author and the spiritual 
leader of reform 
in announcing his defection in paris kadare said he had hoped 
alia would become albanias mikhail gorbachev introducing change 
alia and the others denounced as a traitor the man they had held 
up as an example of isolated albanias proud achievements 
a foreign diplomat speaking anonymously said kadare kept to 
his tirana home for weeks during the summer seeing only fellow 
members of the elite and keeping his distance from alias cautious 
reforms 
while the reporters were in albania everyone seemed to be 
talking of the defection from a 10yearold boy in ancient berat 
to professional people in tirana 
most praised kadare as a great man but some said he had 
abandoned albania in its hour of need few doubted he had dealt a 
heavy perhaps fatal blow to the leadership 
enver ramiz they are gone a worker said 
alia has edged away from the stalinist legacy of enver hoxha 
who ruled from 1944 until his death in 1985 
it seems likely that a crackdown would provoke strong response 
from the 32 million people of albania who know of the 
anticommunist revolutions in eastern europe and crave contact with 
the outside 
the official course of democratization through gradual 
reform without abandoning oneparty rule did not work for any of 
the other communist parties in eastern europe 
albanian leaders appear to bank on what officials describe as 
the countrys special legacy veneration of hoxha 
his name is emblazoned on hillsides across the land and his 
victorious world war ii partisans are commemorated on memorials as 
numerous as the hundreds of concrete bunkers he built to defend 
albania 
hoxha was the first albanian since the revered 15th century hero 
scanderbeg born george castriota to win genuine independence for 
his people 
todays increasingly young population 77 percent of albanians 
are under 40 is more inclined to take independence for granted 
the young are impatient for economic improvement and some of the 
better life they feel the outside enjoys 
europe could and ought to do more for the balkans and for 
albania especially said a student of english at tirana 
university 
what course the leadership will take should become clear at the 
communist party congress expected in about three months 
parliamentary elections are expected next spring under a new law 
that allows the people more scope for nominating candidates 
some diplomats feel those events may be too little and come too 
late 
if violence accompanies change it will be in keeping with 
albanias turbulent history 
life in the mountains that cover 70 percent of the nation has 
changed little in centuries blood feuds bond the small population 
in an intricate network of ancient hatreds 
there aresigns the leadership realizes action is needed to 
avert a crisis 
the party chiefs of tirana and the port of durres albanias two 
largest cities were replaced in an extensive shakeup that followed 
the july embassy crisis 
in august the statue of josef stalin was quietly removed from 
shkodra a northern town street signs are notably scarce along 
tiranas central stalin boulevard although the soviet dictators 
likeness still dominates a nearby park 
censorship has been denounced in the state press but has not 
disappeared a degree of private enterprise has been allowed and 
there is even talk of making the lek convertible 
they are small changes and seem tentative in contrast to the 
increasingly bold mood in the streets 
albanians gleefully invited foreign journalists to share a game 
of cards a drink a chat or dragged them hurriedly homes their 
eagerness made mockery of the slogans plastered everywhere such 
as the unity of the party and people is our strength 
officials were clearly unnerved by the prying of reporters but 
the popular reaction was typified by a tirana students comment as 
two journalists left her and several friends dining and listening 
to western rock music 
goodbye she said smiling you have brought great 
gladness to our party

the pentagon may soon be training military 
officers from the very countries it once viewed as archenemies 
the administration is considering requests from members of the 
sovietled warsaw pact poland hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria 
and romania to participate in a program known as international 
military education and training imet officials say 
while the program probably would cost just several hundred 
thousand dollars the symbolic value of such a project would be 
much higher 
who would have believed we would train officers from the very 
countries which we viewed as our enemies just last year said one 
defense department official 
the possible training project is just one of many options under 
consideration by the bush administration to help countries which 
this year discarded more than four decades of communist rule 
money will be very tight and were considering a range of 
things for eastern europe said a bush administration official 
who like the other official asked not to be named imet is one 
of the things that has been thought about 
that official said the decision on whether to include any east 
europeans in the program would not be made until december when the 
state department puts together its budget request for the fiscal 
year that begins next oct 1 
the program is funded under the foreign aid bill and 
administered jointly with the pentagon the 1990 program totaled 
472 million the size of the individual country programs ranges 
from a low of 15000 up to 338 million for turkey 
there are more than 800000 troops in the warsaw pact not 
counting the soviet union but the alliance is crumbling it lost 
one of seven members this year when east germany merged with west 
germany and hungary is preparing to leave 
pact members have planned a summit later this year to discuss 
the alliances future with plans to transform it to a political 
rather than military grouping 
meanwhile its members have begun reducing the size of their 
sovietarmed and trained military to save money for the expensive 
and painful transition from a staterun economy to a freemarket 
system 
the soviet union also is trying to save money its forces have 
begun pulling out of hungary and czechoslovakia 
there are no soviet troops stationed in romania and bulgaria 
and those in poland and the former territory of east germany 
eventually will be withdrawn now that moscow has decided to bring 
all its troops home 
the way for cooperation with the united states was paved earlier 
this year when nato leaders agreed to set up regular diplomatic 
contacts with members of the warsaw pact 
since then diplomats from eastern europe have received regular 
briefings at nato headquarters in brussels mostly about the crisis 
in the persian gulf and about the soviet union 
nato is debating how far to go in sharing information with the 
east europeans as long as they are still allied militarily with 
moscow the east europeans eager for any contact with the west as 
they restructure their economies and social systems want more 
as we move away from the warsaw pact its clear we have to 
diversify our military ties said one hungarian official he said 
groups of military historians lawyers and sharpshooters from 
hungary and the united states have paid visits to each others 
countries 
in september poland and czechoslovakia offered medical 
facilities for us troops being deployed in saudi arabia romania 
offered the troops recreation facilities on the black sea and 
bulgaria said it would send troops 
romania also has asked for us advice on setting up a military 
chaplains service something that was outlawed under the atheist 
communist regime and on revamping the military judge advocates 
office the officials said 
but the united states still has concerns about romanias human 
rights record especially after the government made up of many 
former communist officials used clubwielding factory workers to 
violently suppress antigovernment protesters last june 
romania still has to correct its image said one us 
official theyve taken some steps in the right direction

alpine villagers who wanted to 
rearrange the rocks atop mount fletschhorn to restore its original 
official height have been told to leave the peak alone newspapers 
said sunday 
until 1952 the mountain in southern switzerland had been 
formally listed at 13123 feet or 4001 meters four thousand 
meters is considered a psychologial barrier for climbers seeking a 
challenge 
the revision cut its official height to 13113 feet or 3998 
meters possibly due to erosion 
three years ago the mayor of saas grunt launched a drive to 
move a few rocks around at the top to reestablish the mountains 
former height and possibly make it more appealing to climbers 
but environmentalists and climbers groups including the swiss 
alpine club opposed the idea urging the mountain be left as it 
is 
authorities in valais canton or state agreed the valais 
surveyors office decided fletschhorn is a majestic part of the 
alps and should remain in its natural state sundays reports said 
the villages mayor german anthamatten was quoted as saying he 
may challenge the ruling 
but the newspapers said he probably faced an uphill battle they 
said in a recent measurement the mountain had lost another five 
feet of height

there hasnt been much friendly banter or 
cordial conversation at the blue and gray restaurant since a 
developer proposed turning an old strip mine into a 30 million 
landfill for outofstate garbage 
ive never in my life seen anything like this said lisa 
knotts a waitress at the popular main street diner people used 
to sit and talk discuss things 
now theyre one way or the other theyre dead set against it 
or for it 
barbour county officials expect a record 90 percent of the 
struggling coalmining countys 8776 registered voters to cast 
ballots tuesday to settle the dispute 
the vote is the first under the states new solidwaste law that 
allows residents of each of the states 55 counties to block 
landfills that would accept more than 10000 tons of trash or more 
each month 
some people in the northcentral west virginia county said 
landfill opponents hold a slim lead others said the race is too 
close to call 
its not very difficult to find people fixing to fight said 
the rev john lepp pastor of two united methodist churches in the 
county i dont know what it will take to get people to 
reconcile 
ive been told there are some people who are not coming back 
to my churches because they think i favor one side 
no blood has been shed the 56yearold lepp said but i dont 
like the subtle things like not speaking to some people or turning 
around when they come into a store or a room 
this is the biggest thing to hit philippi since the civil 
war school bus driver rex freeman said referring to the towns 
claim that it was the site of that wars first land battle 
the landfill proposed last year by energy resource management 
services inc would be at an old surface coal mine about seven 
miles west of philippi or 135 miles south of pittsburgh 
an average of 7500 tons of household waste most of it brought 
in by train from the northeast would be dumped there daily said 
john faltis the companys chief executive officer 
faltis who owns the company with a dutch investor said they 
would invest about 30 million to prepare the site an additional 
24 millio would go toward special railroad cars that could haul 
waste in and take coal out to market 
he said he expects to make 200 million profit by the time the 
landfill is filled in 25 years 
tonnage fees and other charges would inject 5 million annually 
into the countys sputtering economy and residents would get free 
trash pickup said faltis who has operated coal mines and other 
businesses in the area for nearly 20 years 
the company has said the landfill will generate more than 200 
permanent jobs paying 8 to 15 an hour eightyfive percent of 
the employees will be from barbour county under an contract signed 
by faltis and the barbour county commission last summer 
barbour countys unemployment rate in september was 91 percent 
compared to the statewide rate of 54 percent the demand for 
clean nonpolluting fuel has cut the market for the areas 
highsulphur coal and new technology means fewer miners are needed 
to produce what coal is mined 
ten years ago you would have seen 100 working coal mines here 
and thousands of miners earning close to 40000 or 50000 a 
year lepp said those days are long gone 
philippi the county seat has about 3100 residents and is home 
of the private aldersonbroaddus college 
opponents question the landfills safety and the wisdom of 
bringing in huge amounts of outofstate trash 
when you get done filling the site 25 years down the road 
youre going to have 75 million tons of garbage sitting atop the 
highest point in barbour county said businessman chuck schnautz 
wed be setting ourselves up to receive a 75millionton pile of 
garbage and the current technology cant guarantee that we wont 
have problems with it

two americans one a severely wounded 
war veteran said sunday that cambodians and vietnamese offered 
them water and rest on their 120mile friendship run between 
phnom penh and ho chi minh city 
ive been praying for 20 years to come back said clebe 
mcclary who in 1968 lost an eye and an arm as a us marine 
lieutenant in vietnam 
the run was staged to try to speed reconciliation between the 
united states and the governments of cambodia and vietnam neither 
of which washington recognizes 
if we dont get together and smile and talk well never have 
any friendship we caused a lot of destruction in vietnam and i 
think we owe them something mcclary said hey man the wars 
over 
the run began tuesday in the cambodian capital and ended 
saturday in ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
mcclary 49 and stan cottrell 47 complained of the blistering 
heat but were effusive in describing villagers offering them 
hammocks massages and water hundreds of children would follow 
them along the way they said 
unarmed vietnamese policemen escorted them for part of the way 
but there were no incidents and the two said they felt generally at 
ease even in the cambodian countryside where a guerrilla war rages 
between the government and three opposing factions 
their longest daily run was 42 miles a ceremony was held when 
they reached the cambodianvietnamese border and some vietnamese 
joined them for a small segment of the run 
mcclary from pawleys island sc was making his first trip 
back to vietnam since the war in which he lost many friends 
even during the war i loved the people and the country he 
said i was wounded seven times and had 34 operations and they 
said id never walk again he was on his feet shortly after the 
last operation in 1969 and 10 years later became an avid runner 
he said he wanted to bring other veterans back to vietnam 
perhaps on another run in the united states mcclary speaks to and 
counsels high schools church groups and businesses on leadership 
and motivation 
cottrell who lives in a suburb of atlanta is a veteran long 
distance runner in 1981 he crossed the united states at a rate of 
53 miles a day 
he also has made peace runs along chinas great wall in the 
soviet union and last july between berlin and warsaw in 1988 
cottrell completed a vietnam friendship run from the capital 
hanoi to the central coast city of da nang near which mcclary was 
wounded 
i believe that one person can make a difference that 
individuals can break down the walls that divide us he said

construction engineer by day and patrols by night 
a few miles away soviet troops did sentry duty on the rugged 
border between armenia and azerbaijan the scene of ethnic clashes 
for two years 
the sealed frontier between the two republics symbolizes the 
political violence that is rising in distant corners of the soviet 
union as the kremlins political authority falls 
last week two armenian shepherds were killed on the border and 
armenian guerrillas briefly took four soviet soldiers hostage in 
retaliation for the detention of several local residents in the 
embattled enclave of nagornokarabakh 
at least three separatists were killed friday in ethnic strife 
in the southeastern republic of moldavia 
in the caucasian republic of georgia a politician was shot in 
the arm two days before balloting on oct 28 
over the past 18 months violence also has struck along the 
border between uzbekistan and kirgizia the fergana valley of 
uzbekistan the georgian capital of tbilisi and the abkhazian 
section of georgia 
the fighting has helped keep alive rumors that the military and 
kgb security police might be plotting to crack down against the 
disorder that has accompanied the reforms of president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
one rumor depicts gorbachev as the leader of the crackdown 
another as its victim 
in armenia and georgia where passions are running high people 
accuse gorbachev of trying inflame rather than quell the violence 
the kremlin is creating another lebanon in the caucasus they 
want to create the illusion that the caucasians are fighting among 
themselves and that the russians must go in and restore order 
said zviad gamsakhurdia who is emerging as the dominant politician 
in georgia 
soviet central authorities have balked at open intervention in 
georgia since april 9 1989 when army paratroopers used sharpened 
shovels to disperse a peaceful rally in tbilisi killing 19 
the incident sent shock waves through the entire soviet union 
and shoved georgia firmly toward a declaration of independence 
that momentum was evident in balloting last week as 
gamsakhurdias round table noncommunist bloc won control of the 
georgian supreme soviet legislature on a platform of independence 
and capitalism 
the voting was peaceful the campaign at times violent two days 
before the electio gamsakhurdias rival georgi chanturia was 
shot in the arm 
chanturia accused gamsakhurdia of arranging the shooting on 
orders from the kgb gamsakhurdia retorted that chanturia either 
staged the event or was shot by central authorities seeking to 
spark civil war 
the situation is just as murky in moldavia there the 
legislature has declared sovereignty from moscow and talking of 
reunifying with neighboring romania from which it was separated in 
world war ii 
but ethnic russians and ukrainians have declared their own 
dniester republic in eastern moldavia and the gagauz a group 
of christian turks have proclaimed independence in southern 
moldavia 
on wednesday soviet interior ministry troops moved against the 
gagauz and moldavian interior ministry troops clashed with the 
russians and ukrainians on friday 
the lines are not much clearer along the armenianazerbaijani 
border 
the trouble began in late 1988 as christian armenians demanded 
control over nagornokarabakh a largely armenian enclave located 
just over the border in mostly moslem azerbaijan scores have died 
in the dispute and tens of thousands have fled their homes 
last winter the two sides clashed with armor and artillery at 
eraskh and elsewhere soviet interior ministry troops quelled the 
fighting and now the only visible armor belongs to central 
authorities 
sgt viktor rezanov who commands a 10member border checkpoint 
at eraskh keeps the machine gun of his armored personnel trained 
on armenia 
they drive by at night sometimes and shoot off their guns 
said rezanov 20 from the russian city of chelyabinsk squad 
members wear flak jackets to protect them against snipers or 
ambush 
the heavy armor keeps guerrillas in check but tension persists 
said lt vladimir pomashkin 25 
the biggest threat is from armed people who have no right to 
be carrying guns said pomashkin from the russian city of kirov 
they get a gun in their hands and they think they should use 
it

republicans are spooked by recent negative 
polls for their house candidates and hope to capitalize on the 
unpopularity of congress to avoid heavy losses on tuesday 
praise the president and bash the democrat congress said 
rep guy vander jagt summarizing his partys message for the final 
days of the campaign 
there is a ferocious anticongress hostility out there said 
vander jagt who is chairman of the house gop campaign 
organization its a prairie fire and it doesnt take too much 
to shift the feeling from against congress to against those who 
run congress 
but party strategists concede that they will have a hard time 
fully recovering from the decline republican candidates have 
suffered in recent polls 
those losses have been based largely on a perception that the 
party and president bush in particular sought to defend the 
wealthy against tax increases and then endorsed a package that 
imposes higher taxes on nearly everyone 
youve got a big challenge if you want to overcome in 10 days 
what was three years of an opposite message said vander jagt 
rmich 
bush has been on the hustings peddling the message that the 
spending cuts in his budget deal with congress are his and the new 
taxes belong solely to the democrats whether that will sell with 
voters remains to be seen 
that message that the devil made me do it just is not 
credible said larry sabato a political analyst at the 
university of virginia 
polls show that after a precipitous drop three weeks ago 
republican candidates have mostly regained their footing but there 
continues to be slippage particularly in the 29 races for seats 
where no incumbent is seeking reelection 
the open seats are where democrats have their highest hopes for 
making gains 
two are virtually certain to move to the democratic column and 
both represent comebacks for former house members in arkansas 2nd 
district ray thornton is considered a shooin and in hawaiis 1st 
district liberal neil abercrombie is expected to win 
the party is straining to hold on to previously democratic open 
seats in maine florida new jersey ohio and texas but it has a 
good shot at picking up republican seats in connecticut iowa 
idaho and rhode island 
democratic gains in the polls have been particularly strong 
among senior citizens and women leading analysts to conclude that 
the partys economic fairness message is bringing core democrats 
home 
sabato said the net pickup for democrats may well be 10 or more 
seats about twice the shift analysts in both parties had predicted 
around labor day theres a definite drift toward the 
democrats he said 
the party now holds a 258 to 175 majority in the house with two 
vacancies a 10seat shift would give democrats their largest house 
advantage in more than a decade 
but along with the republicans partial recovery have come two 
other phenomena a daytoday instability in poll numbers and a 
marked erosion of support for incumbents in both parties 
the numbers are jumping all over the place said one 
republican operative citing swings of 10 to 15 points for some 
candidates the charts look like a seismograph after an 
earthquake 
vander jagt has told republican colleagues to keep their guard 
up if they won with less than 65 percent of the vote in 1988 or if 
they have an opponent this year who has raised more than 100000 
incumbents who are used to winning handily may be in for 
squeakers and those without a cushion may lose say analysts in 
both parties 
the republicans considered most likely to lose are oregons 
denny smith tainted by the savingsandloan scandal and 
minnesotas arlan stangeland hurt by ethics charges also on the 
endangered list are charles pashayan of california and john hiler 
of indiana 
in vermont trouble for republican rep peter smith could well 
give the house its first socialist member since 1929 bernard 
sanders the former mayor of burlington who is running as an 
independent smith was trailing late last week in private polls 
democrats also have their share of lawmakers in trouble 
californias george brown ben jones of georgia roy dyson of 
maryland and bill sarpalius of texas are among the most vulnerable 
late polls also showed slippage for reps jim jontz of indiana and 
wayne owens of utah 
but the volatility that pollsters have been talking about for 
weeks remains in force 
democratic pollster geoff garin said the turmoil is the result 
of three competing political currents any one of which could 
dominate tuesdays voting the budget deal and the ailing economy 
the countrys general antiincumbent mood and the persian gulf 
crisis all have taken turns at the forefront in recent week 
i or anyone else would be foolish to predict a precise 
outcome said vander jagt this is the most volatile political 
situation any of us has ever experienced

hundreds of iranians chanting death to 
america burned the american flag at a rally sunday in front of 
the former us embassy in tehran to mark the 11th anniversary of 
its takeover by militant students 
tehran television monitored in nicosia showed a large crowd 
carrying signs proclaiming death to america death to 
israel and death to britain 
young men and women including university students converged on 
the rally site from all parts of the capital the television said 
musavi khoeniha the former prosecutor who was the mentor of the 
militant students who stormed the embassy 11 years ago read a 
halfhour message from ayatollah ali khamenei irans spiritual 
leader 
khameneis message urged the countrys feuding radical and 
socalled pragmatic factions to stop their infighting and remain 
united 
parliament speaker mehdi karrubi a hardline opponent of 
khamenei then addressed the crowd warning against the us 
presence in the persian gulf 
he said that the capture of the us nest of spies in iran 
guaranteed the future of the revolution and disrupted americas 
spying machinery 
none of irans highranking leaders showed up at the rally 
which commemorates what is considered a turning point in the 
history of the 1979 revolution 
president hashemi rafsanjani has been trying to temper the 
revolution since the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in june 
1989 
rafsanjani has been engaged in efforts to sideline khomeinis 
hardline antiwestern followers and rebuild relations with the 
west to attract investment and advanced technology 
the radicals accuse rafsanjani and khamenei his political 
ally of straying from khomeinis antiwestern legacy both leaders 
deny that this is true 
rafsanjani said in speech to students from around the country 
sunday that with the capture of the american nest of spies 
documents revealing american plots against the revolution were 
divulged 
blaming the united states for pushing iraq into the 198088 war 
against iran he added that after the failure of its plots 
america imposed the war on iran 
the iranians have condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
but they have also denounced the presence of the usdominated 
multinational force in the gulf 
karrubi said in parliament earlier sunday that iraqs invasion 
of kuwait is not the issue what should come to everyones 
attention is that america has come to the region for oil hegemony 
and more importantly to cofront the islamic revolution and the 
moslem forces of the region 
the date of the embassy takeover also coincides with the day in 
1963 that khomeini was sent into exile by iranian monarch shah 
mohammed reza pahlavi khomeini returned in february 1979 
overthrew the monarchy and established the islamic republic 
on nov 4 1979 khomeinis militant followers stormed the us 
embassy in tehran and took 52 americans hostage for 444 days

october was the cruelest month for many an 
officeseeker 
an illegitimate child a guru a longago pool party events 
long past surfaced in the late stages of campaign 90 to haunt 
candidates and in at least one case spell the end of a political 
career 
minnesota republican jon grunseth suffered a series of seismic 
shocks that forced him to withdraw from the governors race 
first two young women accused him of asking them to swim nude 
with him at a pool party in 1981 when they were teenagers then 
another woman said shed had an affair with him that lasted nearly 
a decade through both of his marriages 
no one else has been forced out of a race over a character 
issue but candidates have been lobbing that type of ammunition 
with regularity hoping something will explode 
in texas allegations suddenly surfaced that democratic 
gubernatorial candidate ann richards had been seen using cocaine 13 
years ago outside a dallas bar the charges by a former aide to the 
man richards defeated in the democratic primary were aired in a 
newspaper article and by a republican sheriff 
a consultant for clayton williams the gop candidate for 
governor said the incident came totally out of left field 
but richards insisted williams was behind it 
this stinks to high heaven she said the story and the 
actions of the republican sheriff of bexar county have taken the 
clayton williams smear campaign to new lows 
in new orleans congressional candidate marc morial is trying to 
control damage from the recent disclosure that he fathered an 
illegitimate child eight years ago while a law student 
the news broke right after the oct 6 primary a few days after 
the little girls mother filed suit seeking child support the 
woman now an attorney in africa said she had never before sought 
or received a penny from morial 
former rep toby moffett attempting to recapture a house seat 
in connecticut used his closing time in a debate to unleash an 
attack against waterbury alderman gary franks his republican 
rival 
moffett said franks a landlord had been cited 51 times for 
health fire or safety code violations including a rat bite 
franks had no time left and could not respond but after the debate 
he called moffett mr cheap shot 
and in north carolina gop sen jesse helms is accusing democrat 
harvey gantt who is black of using government for personal gain 
the specific charge getting a cheap television license as part of 
a minority controlled investment group then selling the license 
for a huge profit a few months later 
it made mr gantt a millionaire helms said no wonder he 
has a swimming pool in his back yard and a tennis court he made 
that off of a deception 
gantt who has a tennis court but not a swimming pool said the 
minority investors sold their license because operating the station 
was going to cost far more than expected he said voters should be 
contemplating education and the environment not whether or not 
i bought a television station with private money 
in oregon sen mark hatfield ignored democratic challenger 
harry lonsdale until it looked like lonsdale might unseat him then 
state republicans revived a 5yearold controversy over bhagwan 
shree rajneesh an indian guru who died in the interim 
a county judge who was poisoned by the gurus followers five 
years ago held a news conference to release copies of a newspaper 
ad signed and paid for by lonsdale 
the ad ran shortly after rajneesh pleaded guilty to immigration 
fraud charges and left the country it said americans should be 
ashamed of the harassment and abuse heaped on this gentle man 
lonsdale said last week that the gurus followers were 
persecuted because they were different he said his ad was meant to 
support religious freedom and that hatfield had written rajneesh a 
letter reflecting the same sentiments 
some campaign surprises fizzled or backfired immediately on 
impact 
in connecticut gop rep john rowland accused former sen lowell 
weicker a rival for the governors seat of violating a senate 
conflictofinterest rule and possibly engaging in insider trading 
of stocks and bonds 
weicker was ready 
the entire premise of mr rowlands smear rests on a 
nonexistent senate rule and a web of circumstance and innuendo 
he declared 
running as an independent weicker still leads the threeway 
race 
across the country in nebraska former sen john tower said hed 
heard that democratic sen jim exon was a boozer towers remark 
made during a campaign appearance for exons rival former rep hal 
daub sparked a round of speculation on exons drinking habits 
but tower may have done daub more harm than good in his quest to 
unseat exon the remark prompted a revival of rumors that daub 
abused his wife and it caused her to release a letter saying the 
allegations werent true 
cindy daub said exon implied that my husband beat me up which 
resulted in me going to socalled shelters she called that the 
most heinous personal attack possible and unbecoming of a united 
states senator 
exon is coasting to an easy win

city employees who sold thousands of 
cobblestones taken from a driveway near the historic union station 
might have made a costly mistake says a city councilman 
councilman bob evans says he and members of the landmarks 
preservation commission discovered that about 24000 cobblestones 
were sold to a contractor who gave the city 1000 in credit toward 
other work on the stationrestoration project 
in my view we gave away a very valuable resource for 
nothing said evans an architect 
city publicworks officials should have known about a design 
guideline that requires historic materials salvaged from the 
station be saved for other city projects he said last week 
no one has come up with an estimate of the stones worth said 
city engineer ben thompson 
union station is being renovated and a wing added to house 
federal courts publicworks officials say they were simply trying 
to save money with the cobblestone arrangement

at least six republican governors are in 
danger of losing their jobs in tuesdays elections as they are 
judged by voters frustrated by higher taxes and worried about 
recession 
gop control of several open seats also is in jeopardy and the 
races for five of the biggest states california texas florida 
ohio and illinois are closely contested four of the five ohio 
being the exception are in gop hands now 
republicans are hanging on by a thread in almost a dozen 
races said political analyst charles cook many more 
republican seats are closer to the edge than democratic ones 
high on the list of vulnerable gop governors is florida gov bob 
martinez who is locked in a close race with democratic challenger 
lawton chiles 
gop governors in nebraska kansas maine and rhode island also 
are trailing or in close contests in the polls 
a sixth alabama gov guy hunt is in a close race in a state 
that hadnt elected a gop governor this century until he won four 
years ago hunt faces democrat paul hubbert in what has become a 
bitter contest 
gop govs kay orr in nebraska and mike hayden in kansas started 
behind due to voter anger over local tax increases incumbents 
edward diprete in rhode island and john mckernan in maine were hurt 
by the northeasts economic downturn 
mckernan has staged a comeback in the polls against former gov 
joseph brennan but theres been no recovery for diprete polls 
show him down as much as 3to1 to democrat bruce sundlun 
republican retirements also have left democrats in strong 
positions in new mexico and oklahoma 
some democraticcontrolled governorships may fall too however 
and with a 2921 advantage in governors seats democrats have more 
to lose in the 36 gubernatorial races this year many races were 
statistical dead heats in the final days before the election 
it could be the best of times it could be the worst of 
times said mark gearan director of the democratic governors 
association we could be in a situation where all of our 
candidates win or they dont but its also clear in several of 
the open seats we have leads right now 
at least two potential democratic losses may not be gop gains 
independent candidates are leading in threeway races in alaska and 
connecticut 
both independent candidates are former republicans now running 
outside their party former nixon cabinet member wally hickel in 
alaska and former sen lowell weicker in connecticut 
among democratic incumbents minnesota gov rudy perpich is in 
danger despite republican turmoil gop nominee jon grunseth 
withdrew last week because of a sexual impropriety scandal and was 
replaced by arne carlson who was strongly opposed by antiabortion 
conservatives 
for all the republican woes polls showed carlson in a tight 
race with perpich a twoterm incumbent known for his eccentricity 
democrats are in danger of losing ohio republican george 
voinovich the former mayor of cleveland is leading democrat 
anthony celebrezze who made a celebrated switch to support for 
abortion rights democratic gov richard celeste is retiring 
seeking a third term in michigan democrat james blanchard is in 
a race that has tightened in recent days a late poll showed 
republican john engler pulling to within 4 percentage points 
but a combination of economic recession the abortion issue and 
a variety of regional distinctions appears to give democrats the 
upper hand in many of the governors races 
close to an unmitigated disaster was how conservative 
political consultant david keene summarized gop prospects the 
only hope we have is the volatility 
republican attention has focused on the biggest states where 
the party hopes to hold veto power when democratic legislatures 
draw new congressional maps to reflect results of the 1990 census 
california is the biggest prize with a potential sevenseat 
house gain democrat dianne feinstein is in a close race against 
gop sen pete wilson though some polls give wilson the edge 
california thats the ball game said norm cummings 
political director of the republican national committee 
in florida martinez has recovered from a doubledigit deficit 
in the polls but still faces high negative ratings left from a tax 
flipflop early in his term and anger over his antiabortion moves 
chiles has his own troubles too however including controversy 
over his acknowledged use of an antidepression drug the national 
abortion rights action league has been airing antimartinez 
commercials though chiles appears reluctant to push the issue much 
himself 
another headline race is in texas where republican clayton 
williams has squandered a big lead through a series of gaffes 
including his refusal to shake hands with democrat ann richards 
williams who has put some 8 million of his own money into the 
race has built a following by campaigning as a roughhewn texas 
cowboy 
his string of missteps continued into the final weekend of the 
campaign when he admitted in an offhand way that he paid no income 
taxes for 1986 polls showed the race a tossup

hindu leaders on sunday suspended a 
campaign to seize a mosque after claiming to reach an accord with 
authorities but officials said no concessions were made to end the 
dispute that has left at least 325 dead 
in new delhi meanwhile moves to oust prime minister vp singh 
grew while opponents worked for compromises to prevent new 
parliament elections 
despite the signs of calm in ayodhya about 300 miles southeast 
of new delhi violence linked to the mosque flared in neighboring 
nations at least two moslems were killed by a hindu mob in nepal 
and security around hindu temples in pakistan was increased to 
prevent moslem attacks 
the hindu militants said they reached a deal with civil 
authorities to allow them to visit the disputed holy site on 
wednesday 
ashok singhal who was at the forefront of the hindu assault on 
the mosque last week called on thousands of pilgrims in ayodhya to 
end the seige and hold a traditional hindu fire ceremony to mark 
the end of a significant event 
singhal said a prayer meeting would start monday and conclude 
wednesday with a visit to the 460yearold mosque which they claim 
was built atop the birthplace of the hindu warrior god rama 
but authorities said they had not yet decided to lift a curfew 
on ayodhya that would let the prayer meeting go ahead 
hindus seek to raze the mosque and erect a hindu temple on the 
site 
a handwritten statement from singhal leader of the world hindu 
council said a public meeting would be held nov 11 in new delhi 
to decide the future campaign for the temple project 
sources said the fundamentalists had presented four demands for 
ending the standoff 
among the requests is the lifting of a 10dayold curfew in 
ayodhya allowing hindu worshipers to visit the disputed shrine 
and the release of hindus arrested while attempting to start 
construction of the temple 
but sources indicated hindu leaders were prepared to drop a 
demand for the suspension of officers who ordered police toopen 
fire on rampaging mobs tuesday and friday at least 22 people were 
killed in the two incidents among at least 325 killed nationwide 
in the dispute 
about 4000 hindus from across the country have left ayodhya in 
the past few days ignoring pleas from their leaders to stay until 
the temple is built an estimated 10000 remain 
the dispute was touched off when the leader of a hindu 
rightwing party lal krishna advani was arrested oct 24 while 
leading a caravan to ayodhya to help build the proposed temple 
since the arrest riots have spread across india and neighboring 
nations it has also brought singhs 11monthold coalition 
government to the brink of collapse 
singh who faces a confidence vote wednesday lost his majority 
in parliament when the prohindu bharatiya janata party withdrew 
support because of the ayodhya dispute 
hindus make up 82 percent of indias 880 million people while 
moslems comprise 12 percent 
on sunday two ministers resigned from the government raising 
to five the number in the 38member cabinet who deserted singh in 
the last two weeks 
meanwhile two singh opponents in his janata dal party said they 
plan a meeting monday with other dissident party members they hope 
to dump singh as party leader and prime minister in hopes of 
preserving the government and averting parliamentary elections 
but advani who was released sunday said new elections were the 
only way out of the political impasse 
this government has forfeited both its moral and political 
right to continue even for a single day he said 
in nepal two moslems who allegedly defiled a hindu temple were 
killed saturday when hindus stormed a house where they were being 
held to await authorities five people were injured in the incident 
in harion about 50 miles south of katmandu the home ministry 
said 
moslems comprise only 3 percent of nepals 16 million people 
ninety percent are hindu 
in mainly moslem pakistan police and army troops increased 
patrols around hindu temples sunday after several attacks 
including an attempt saturday to blow up a temple in the southern 
port city of karachi newspaper reports said

hungary plans to join the council of 
europe on tuesday the first of several former communist bloc 
nations expected to gain membership in the oldest postwar body 
promoting european cooperation 
hungary will seal its membership by signing the councils human 
rights treaty at a ceremony in rome 
the 1950 treaty established the european court of human rights 
which has heard more than 15000 such cases from the 23 present 
council members 
the rights treaty is one of 130 international conventions 
ranging from computer data protection to antiterrorism measures 
that council of europe nations have signed to date 
other east european nations are expected to gain admittance next 
year as the 41yearold council expands its role with europe 
emerging from the cold war 
czechoslovakia poland the soviet union and yugoslavia have 
been given observer status as a step toward full membership 
romania and albania may become observers soon officials said 
for membership a country must be a pluralistic democracy and 
must sign the human rights convention 
the strasbourgbased council has long existed in the shadow of 
other organizations notably the more powerful european community 
a separate 12nation body based in brussels belgium 
but the council is now seeking to become the primary body 
bringing together nations from both sides of the former iron 
curtain 
the countries of eastern europe urgently need a structure 
capable of accommodating them and assisting them on the path to 
democratic reform said catherine lalumiere the councils 
secretary general 
the council of europe wants to form a 300seat assembly of 
legislators from among the 34 european and north american nations 
in the conference on security and cooperation in europe and become 
europes chief human rights watchdog 
in both cases the council would take on activities of the csce 
a loosely defined body established in 1975 as a forum for 
occasional talks between former cold war adversaries especially on 
human rights and security issues the conference includes the 
united states canada and all of europe except albania 
many european governments now believe the conference must be 
strengthened and see the council of europe as the right 
organization for the job 
it would be both logical and reasonable for the council of 
europe to be given a mandate by the csce to continue that 
conferences work by implementing the principles which it has laid 
down ms lalumiere said 
only the united states has raised objections to the plan 
but the other conference members may decide to push for a 
parliamentary assembly without immediate us participation said 
anders bjorck of sweden president of the councils parliamentary 
assembly 
the us position is causing widespread irritation to say the 
least bjorck said but we will not change our position 
a conference summit is scheduled for nov 1921 in paris the 
meeting is expected to be highlighted by the signing of a 
natowarsaw pact accord ordering deep cuts in conventional forces 
from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains

a blast from a hunters shotgun killed his 
son two years ago but when no one came forward to accept 
responsibility martin c rogan knew what had to be done 
my son was the type of kid who would have said to me find 
out who killed me and dont let this go said rogan his eyes 
filling with tears 
i felt an extreme responsibility to learn what happened he 
said 
jack c rogan was found dead in the woods a few hundred yards 
behind his rural eastern connecticut home on nov 25 1988 the 
second day of the deer hunting season a single pellet of buckshot 
had struck the 26yearold in the neck and penetrated the lower 
part of his brain an autopsy showed 
tormented by the unanswered questions about their sons death 
and embittered by the belief that a hunter knew of his deadly 
mistake but didnt want to fess up martin and betty rogan doggedly 
pursued the case 
they offered a 15000 reward hired a private investigator 
wrote to political leaders unsuccessfully sought a grand jury 
investigation and finally took a suspect to court in a civil case 
the man a neighbor of jack rogans refused to respond to more 
than 100 questions asserting his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
the rogans persistence paid off two men were arrested in 
october including the neighbor after state police detectives 
followed up a tip the rogans received in august from an anonymous 
telephone caller 
only 10 days before jack rogans death a woman in maine karen 
wood was killed by a hunter in an accident that focused national 
attention on the dangers that each hunting season brings 
the rogans became good friends with woods husband kevin wood 
and attended the manslaughter trial last month of the man who shot 
his wife the trial ended with an acquittal 
he could understand our feelings and we could understand 
his rogan said 
the dangers of hunting season was brought home in pennsylvania 
when that states smallgame season opened late last month three 
hunters were fatally shot during turkeyhunting accidents on 
opening day alone 
unfortunately the key to these accidents is that people are 
not positively identifying their targets said jim filkosky who 
is in charge of hunter education for the pennsylvania game 
commission 
in the rogan case police allege a young man hunting illegally 
shot jack rogan and fled before police arrived letting his hunting 
companion cover up for him 
michael wisniewski jr 23 was charged with firstdegree 
manslaughter police said he did not have a hunting license was 
using buckshot which is illegal in connecticut and fired the 
fatal shot after the close of the legal shooting time 
richard p gorman 41 who lives two houses down the road from 
the rogan house was arrested on a charge of hindering prosecution 
police contend that wisniewski mistook rogan for a deer and shot 
him and that gorman made up a story to protect him gorman who is 
married to wisniewskis cousin told police he was hunting alone 
just before sunset when he heard shots and discovered the body 
both wisniewski and gorman plan to plead innocent to the 
charges their lawyers said 
jack rogan the owner of his own trucking and excavation 
business was not hunting when he was shot a hammer and nails were 
found by his side his father said he wasnt sure what his son was 
doing 
we will not be satisfied until justice has come a complete 
path someone is convicted and we get all the details of what went 
on he said

the people who orchestrated the biggest protest in 
east germanys communist history marked the occasion sunday with a 
small rally against a united germanys capitalist system 
about 5000 people met on alexanderplatz berlins central 
square and the scene of a historic rally that drew an estimated 1 
million people one year earlier 
the nov 4 1989 rally helped lead to the opening of the berlin 
wall five days later sped the pace of democratic reforms and was a 
key link in the chain of events that resulted in german unity 
the demonstrators on sunday demanded better social guarantees as 
the former east german nation which joined west germany on oct 3 
struggles to adapt to a free market democracy 
unemployment and living costs have skyrocketed in the last few 
months the old socialist system which guaranteed low prices and 
full employment while denying basic freedoms of speech and travel 
is being dismantled 
one year ago alexanderplatz was a spinetingling sea of people 
who stood peacefully on the sprawling plaza and chanted we are 
the people at a shocked disoriented communist leadership on the 
brink of extinction 
the chant later evolved into we are one people as the revolt 
for freedom was supplanted by a mass movement for german unity 
on sunday protesters held up signs saying we are a stupid 
people and we were the people to protest what they say is a 
coldly pragmatic capitalist system that pays insufficient attention 
to the human costs of the nations radical economic and social 
transition 
look for a job as a minister without portfolio read one 
sign a jab at the five former east german government officials who 
now make more than 2800 monthly as ministers in the united 
government the ministers have no clearly defined duties 
baerbel bohley leader of the new forum activist group and the 
best known of the dissidents who helped lead the democratic revolt 
was among several famous people at sundays rally 
the revolution is not over and therefore we may not stand 
aside she told the crowd 
new forum an association of liberal artists and intellectuals 
was unable to establish a clearly defined political identity after 
its remarkable success with the peaceful democracy revolution 
despite acting as the voice of the people during the former 
nations most dramatic period of crisis new forum and its 
affiliated groups have been reduced to a respected but largely 
unsupported fringe political party 
several celebrities attended sundays rally including british 
actress glenda jackson american folksinger pete seeger and german 
authors christa wolf and guenter grass

former president reagan says he didnt have 
to think 30 seconds about selling missiles to iran but denies he 
tried to swap weapons for american hostages according to excerpts 
of his memoirs published sunday 
reagan also acknowleged he still doesnt know all the facts in 
the irancontra case which became the biggest scandal of his 
eightyear administration in the case weapons were sold to iran 
with the profits secretly diverted to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
while the irancontra case made him unhappy reagan said his 
greatest regret as president was sending marines to beirut lebanon 
where a suicide bomber attacked the marine barracks on oct 23 
1983 killing 241 servicemen 
reagan said he was convinced it was a good idea to deploy 
marines in wartorn lebanon as peacekeepers but american 
officials did not realize how vulnerable the servicemen were in the 
barracks on a wideopen space 
in any case sending the marines to beirut was the source of 
my greatest regret and greatest sorrow reagan wrote in the 
excerpts from an american life appearing in the this weeks 
editions of time magazine 
on the irancontra case reagan said he and other officials 
relied heavily on information from israeli officials in deciding to 
sell weapons to iran in mid1985 
at first reagan said he didnt want to do it because the 
iranians sponsored terrorism but the former president said when he 
learned through the israelis that the group seeking the weapons did 
not support terrorist activities he didnt hesitate 
once we had information that we could trust the people in 
iran i didnt have to think 30 seconds about saying yes i was 
told the few missiles would not significantly change the balance in 
irans war with iraq so i said ok one small shipment from 
israel to allow the israelis to prove they were talking with the 
highest levels of the us government 
but reagan said he insisted the iranians use their influence to 
get american hostages in lebanon freed the hostages were held by 
proiranian shiites moslems 
over a 15month period three american hostages were released 
but three more were captured six americans remain in captivity in 
lebanon terry anderson a correspondent for the associated press 
who was seized in march 1985 is the longest held american 
no problem was more frustrating for me than trying to get the 
hostages home reagan said even so he denied that the weapons 
sale was a armsforhostages deal 
to this day i still believe that the iran initiative was not 
an effort to swap arms for hostages but i know it may not look 
that way to some people he wrote 
nevertheless reagan said the cloud that descended over my 
credibility during irancontra undoubtedly affected my last two 
years in office 
even today reagan said he is in the dark about some details a 
presidential commission and an independent counsel have both 
investigated the case 
if he could relive the past reagan said he would demand that 
former national security adviser john poindexter and his thenaide 
oliver north explain irancontra they were most involved in 
setting up the diversion 
i would bring both of them into the oval office and say ok 
john and ollie level with me tell me what really happened and 
what it is that you have been hiding from me tell me 
everything reagan wrote 
if i had done that at least i wouldnt be sitting here 
writing this book still ignorant of some of the things that went 
on during the irancontra affair he wrote

ronald harmelin didnt fit the flashy drug 
kingpin image no tailored silk suit dripping gold jewelry or 
gleaming mercedesbenz for him 
still he had 672 grams of cocaine in the trunk of his 
9yearold ford when he was arrested by suburban oak park police on 
may 12 1986 under michigan law that was enough to justify his 
life sentence without parole 
the us supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments monday on 
whether michigans law requiring such a sentence is cruel and 
unusual punishment under the states law possession of 650 grams 
or more of cocaine brings a mandatory sentence of life in prison 
without parole 
harmelin probably would be out of prison by now if federal 
officials arrested him under federal law a first offender 
possessing 650 grams almost 1 pounds would face a 
fiveto40year penalty with possibility of parole 
thats the difference between being busted by the drug 
enforcement administration and oak park police its the difference 
between one year and the rest of his life said paul denenfeld a 
lawyer for the american civil liberties union it flies in the 
face of individualized sentencing 
from his cell at scott regional facility in a detroit suburb 
the 45yearold harmelin got the high courts attention with a 
petition that he was unjustly thrown into the pit of prison for 
all eternity without the hope of release 
thats the point said oakland county prosecutor richard 
thompson who will argue that harmelins sentence is 
constitutional 
michigans law is the most enlightened in the country 
thompson said it provides a deterrent and permanently removes 
the drug trafficking from the community 
detroit lawyer carla johnson appointed to represent harmelin 
said sentencing should look at prior criminal record and level of 
involvement in the drug world harmelin had no prior record 
he was not proven to be anything but a possessor of cocaine 
johnson said the people who end up doing mandatory life are not 
the kingpins the statute was aimed at these people are mostly 
firsttime offenders and to punish them like we punish murderers is 
not right 
the aclu said it was concerned other states will enact laws 
similar to michigans if it is upheld by the supreme court 
in california for instance no state laws regulate sentencing 
for drug crimes judges rely on federal guidelines to put away drug 
dealers for life without parole 
well certainly be taking a look at the michigan case said 
john gordnier an assistant attorney general in california well 
be interested in the arguments 
gordnier said the concept of life without parole is appropriate 
many of those who deal with narcotics have probably caused 
someone to receive drugs and later die as a result of the drugs 
he said the penalty is not inappropriate given the price society 
is paying 
in florida those convicted of selling purchasing or delivering 
more than 400 grams of cocaine face a mandatory 15 years in prison 
and a 250000 fine said richard doran the florida attorney 
generals director of criminal appeals 
florida doesnt have to prove the offender was a dealer 
if you have more than 400 grams in your possession the state 
assumes youre a trafficker doran said cocaine is usually sold 
by the gram 
neil fink chairman of criminal defense lawyers of michigan 
said if the high court upholds the law harmelin can again petition 
the michigan supreme court which refused in january to hear the 
case 
there are 123 inmates in michigan serving sentences like 
harmelins 
harmelin who could not be interviewed can only wait a 
decision is expected early next year johnson said harmelin remains 
hopeful 
with all this publicity hes kind of got his spirits up a 
little bit johnson said freedom is a state of mind if you 
think you can get out theres some hope and you can tolerate it

abul abbas the mastermind of the achille 
lauro ship hijacking five years ago confirmed sunday that libya 
has expelled 145 members of his radical group and closed down four 
training camps 
abul abbas said the move was a surprise to him and his wing of 
the palestine liberation front considered to be a major terrorist 
organization 
he said the ejection was unjustified and urged libyas leader 
col moammar gadhafi to reopen the camps and the groups offices 
the government in tripoli has not given an explanation for its 
action he said reports began to surface about a week ago that 
libya had expelled the palestinians 
arab diplomats in baghdad said the united states had asked king 
hassan of morroco and egyptian president hosni mubarak to press 
gadhafi to eject the group 
gadhafi is believed to want libyas removal from the us state 
departments list of countries supporting terrorism 
plo chief yasser arafat has also been pressed to dissociate 
himself from abul abbas who has one seat on the executive 
committee of the palestine liberation organization pressure to 
remove abul abbas increased after his group raided an israeli beach 
in may an action that to a break in usplo dialogue 
after the raid on the israeli beach abul abbas apologized to 
arafat saying the plo chief did not about the raid in advance he 
also said that civilians were not targets in that raid counter to 
israeli claims 
abul abbas dismissed reports the plo leadership had asked libya 
to kick out his group 
we rule out any possibility that the plo leadership has asked 
for this but some palestinian circles who oppose our militant line 
might have done so he said 
he said that most of the group had moved to lebanon and others 
to places that he delined to name 
abul abbas whose real name is mohammed abbas leads one of two 
wings of the palestine front which split from ahmed jibrils 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command in 
1977 
based in baghdad since leaving lebanon in 1982 abul abbas is 
believed to have several hundred guerrilla fighters in his 
organization in iraq lebanon and until now libya 
the other wing of the palestine front based in damascus was 
led by talaat yacoub who died two years ago 
abul abbas said two of the camps were places where plo fighters 
were trained for naval combat one was a small town east of 
tripoli and the other was west of tripoli he said he did not 
provide the others locations 
the palestinian leader said his group would continue its armed 
struggle against israel but insisted that the group will not 
attack any targets outside of the jewish state 
abul abbas said that he had no plans to attack americans or 
other westerners despite the persian gulf crisis but he said his 
group will fight alongside iraq if it is attacked by the usled 
multinational forces in the gulf 
in panarab battles we will carry out our duties alongside our 
brothers in iraq he said 
the achille lauro a mediterranean cruise ship was hijacked 
oct 7 1985 and held by terrorists for two days a 69yearold 
wheelchairbound jewishamerican passenger leon klinghoffer was 
killed during the hijacking and his body dumped into the sea 
a genoa court in 1986 convicted abbas in absentia of 
masterminding the hijacking abbas maintained had merely played a 
role in negotiating the release of the ship in exchange for freedom 
for the hijackers

troops wounded dozens of palestinians sunday 
and ordered curfews across the gaza strip government leaders 
dismissed as onesided a un call for international protection 
of arabs under israeli occupation 
israel radio said 86 palestinians were injured in widespread 
clashes following the death of a jailed palestinian while arab 
reports said 70 were hurt the army put the number at 27 and said 
it was checking the other figures 
a foreign ministry statement castigated un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar for his report thursday in which he 
suggested broadening the mandate of un institutions in israel to 
safeguard the 17 million palestinians under occupation 
the report was produced as a recommendation to the un security 
council on response to the killing oct 8 of 20 palestinians on 
jersusalems temple mount by israeli authorities 
the world communitys continued preoccupation with this 
subject can only serve those forces who are interested in creating 
a link between the arabisraeli conflict and the gulf crisis the 
statement said 
the statement assailed a proposal to convene the signatories of 
the fourth geneva convention of 1949 which sets out rules for the 
treatment of civilians in wartime 
israel is disappointed at the onesided approach exhibited in 
the report it said the recommendations in the report are 
directed only toward israel and do not see fit to call for a 
cessation of violence on the palestinian side 
israel has refused to accept a un investigation into the oct 
8 incident on temple mount a site holy to both jews and moslems 
israel says the inquiry would undermine its sovereignty in 
jerusalem 
israel had conducted its own investigation and extracted the 
necessary lessons it said 
a governmentappointed panel defended the action by police 
saying they faced a threat to their lives but it also said top 
officers failed to adequately supervise riotcontrol troops 
under the panels recommendation the cabinet set up a permanent 
sevenmember ministerial committee to oversee temple mount affairs 
police minister roni milo upgraded jerusalem to a full police 
district sunday acting on the commissions recommendations milo 
did not say if senior officers would be transferred or fired 
about 350 officers will be added to jerusalems 1000member 
force and the public will be encouraged to volunteer for the civil 
guard said police spokeswoman ruth shlezinger 
in the gaza strip extensive curfews were imposed and the area 
of 750000 residents was declared a military zone and was closed to 
reporters 
arab reports said at least 180 people were injured during the 
weekend violence started with rumors that a palestinian inmate was 
killed by israeli troops israeli authorities say the man hanged 
himself in his cell 
in some sections of gaza city streets were littered with stones 
and scorched remains of burning tires masked youths in the citys 
nasser quarter fired rocks with slingshots at soldiers checking 
identification papers on a street 
arsonists gutted the town hall of khan yunis in gaza arab 
reports said gaza police were not immediately available for 
comment 
a senior aide of palestine liberation organization chief yasser 
arafat claimed two girls schools with hundreds of pupils in the 
gaza strip were hit by gas bombs fired by israeli troops 
bassam abu sharif also said in a statement that dozens of other 
arabs were wounded when israeli troops opend fired on a khan yunis 
hospital and a number of clinics in the area run by the un relief 
and works agency 
the statement was sent to the associated press in nicosia 
cyprus from plo headquarters in tunis tunisia 
israel captured the west bank gaza strip and arab east 
jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed east

secretary of state james a baker iii 
ventured into the desert of saudi arabia on sunday to give a pep 
talk to 4200 us troops who may be ordered into combat against 
iraq if other pressure tactics do not free kuwait from saddam 
husseins grasp 
the men and women who must weather duststorms searing heat and 
boredom were mostly receptive to their distinguished visitor who 
was launching a fastpaced survey of arab european and soviet 
sentiment for war with iraq 
one soldier gave baker a chew of tobacco another a package of 
combat rations baker a texan and exmarine received both 
offerings comfortably he chewed the tobacco and said of the food 
i used to live on this stuff it was a little bit different then 
they were in cans 
but there were murmurs of discontent within the ranks as well 
most of us assume we will be going to war sooner or later 
2nd lt henry wardick 23 a west point graduate told reporters 
im from alabama a female sergeant said im tired of 
eating this dirt im tired of drinking hot water im ready to go 
home moreover she said i havent had a chance to have a 
baby 
and when baker who wore khakis and worn cowboy boots told 
another soldier that the saudi desert was not much different from 
texas the soldier politely disagreed its a little bit 
different he said 
baker arrived in bahrain the financial hub of the persian gulf 
after a 15hour flight from washington he was whisked immediately 
by helicopter across the border to eastern saudi arabia passing 
over camels running wild in the desert 
there at a location censored by bakers staff he addressed and 
mingled with the soldiers from the first cavalry division out of 
fort hood texas they are among more than 110000 defending the 
saudi oil fields and are equipped with m1 tanks bradley fighting 
vehicles a multilaunch rocket system and shoulderfired stinger 
missiles 
this is a long way from home baker told the troops but i 
think that americans are home wherever our principles are and 
thats really what this crisis is all about 
as he stepped down from the podium to mingle a soldier took the 
microphone and to the accompaniment of the division band sang lee 
greenwoods song im proud to be an american 
afterward baker told reporters traveling with him i was 
pleased to see that the morale is good they all seemed to be 
upbeat the main question is what the future holds that is 
something that cannot be answered with any specificity 
baker said as he flew here saturday he was laying the foundation 
for stronger economic and political measures against iraq or even 
military action 
unprovoked aggression should not be rewarded unprovoked 
aggression should not be permitted to succeed baker told the 
troops in what has become a familiar refrain since saddam hussein 
conquered kuwait and seized its oil fields in a blitzkrieg invasion 
aug 2 the world made a terrible mistake in the 30s when we 
were unable or refused to stand up to unprovoked aggression 
here he met with leaders of the ruling royal family of this 
wealthy ministate which has strong ties to kuwait sheik isa bin 
saman al khalifa the emir of bahrain sheik khalifa bin sulman 
and sheik mohammed bin mubarak al khalifa to go over various 
scenarios to evict iraq including use of force 
a us official briefing reporters afterward said bahrain 
would like the sanctions to get the job done but military action 
was one of the options responsible governments have to study 
there are 9000 us troops in bahrain the country also has 
sent its own small ground contingent to saudi arabia and made its 
air force available 
information minister tariq almoayed spoke in terms of resolve 
and supported strong statements being made by american officials 
there is no reason to have all these armies from around the 
world here and tie their hands he said everybody in this part 
of the world i think feels all of these armies from all the world 
are not here for a picnic 
this was the first business session undertaken by the emir since 
he was hospitalized in october with an undisclosed ailment and it 
took place at a hospital where the ruler has been recuperating 
on monday baker goes to saudi arabia the linchpin of the arab 
alliance against saddam there official kuwaiti sources told the

jesse jackson is heavily favored to win 
election as a shadow senator for the district of columbia on 
tuesday but hes likely to find the doors locked when he gets to 
congress 
jackson is one of 11 candidates vying for two shadow senator 
positions hes making his first bid for elective office other than 
two unsuccessful runs for the democratic presidential nomination 
the nonpaying shadow senators will lobby congress to grant 
statehood to the district of columbia but by precedent and custom 
only senators elected by one of the 50 states are given floor 
rights in the senate and office space in the capitol complex 
senator mitchell has asked staff to look into precedent and 
no decision has been made on whether jackson will be granted 
floor privileges said diane dewhurst a spokeswoman for senate 
majority leader george mitchell 
the district also will elect a new nonvoting delegate to 
congress with democrat eleanor holmes norton favored over 
republican harry singleton 
but while the delegates house seat is nonvoting it is 
officially recognized and the winner will get an office floor 
privileges and the right to vote in committee 
going back to the 1790s when the tennessee territory first used 
the shadow concept to lobby for statehood no one elected to 
such a post has been granted the rights of elected members of 
congress the last time a shadow legislator was used was by 
alaska which became the 49th state in 1959 
jackson brushes aside questions about the rights a shadow 
lawmaker would have 
its a matter of understanding mainly making the senate and 
the house realize that there are over 600000 people in this city 
who pay taxes go to war but dont have voting representation on 
capitol hill he said last week it is a fundamental issue of 
fairness 
district of columbia voters first approved sending a shadow 
delegation to congress in 1980 but the city council twice 
postponed scheduled elections for the positions 
this year after aggressive lobbying by jackson the 13member 
council gave the goahead but because of concerns over the citys 
100 million deficit the council killed a bill that would have 
provided 13 million for office rental and staff for the two 
shadow senators and a shadow house member

democrats on sunday accused republicans of 
racism in the north carolina senate race as a federal judge 
scheduled an electioneve hearing on whether the gops tactics are 
intimidating voters 
republican officials dismissed allegations that voter mailings 
in north carolina and texas were designed to intimidate minority or 
elderly voters 
but us district judge dickinson debevoise scheduled a hearing 
for monday in newark nj to determine whether the republican 
national committee is violating a 1982 consent decree that bars 
voter intimidation 
the hearing was requested by the democratic national committee 
what the republican party has done is absolutely disgusting 
democratic party chairman ronald brown said on cbstvs face the 
nation he accused the gop of trying to intimidate the poorest 
and most vulnerable voters 
the controversy has centered primarily on north carolina where 
republican sen jesse helms is in a neckandneck race with 
democrat harvey gantt who is black 
at issue are 150000 officiallooking postcards that the north 
carolina gop sent to predominantly minority democratic precincts 
labeled voter registration bulletin the cards read in 
part that is a federal crime to knowingly give false information 
about your name residence or period of residence to an election 
official 
we knew that in a panic jesse helms would turn to this kind of 
tactic just as republicans have done in the past brown said 
voter mailings also have been sent out in texas to predominantly 
elderly democratic voters encouraging them to forego absentee 
ballots 
charles black a spokesman for the republican national 
committee said he had not seen any of the mailings but insisted 
the gop has never broken the consent decree on voter intimidation 
the committee always plays by the rules he said but he 
added that north carolina has a long history of democrats 
stealing elections state and local leaders have a 
responsibility to take legal action to ensure the integrity of the 
ballot and thats all thats going on there he said 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo disagreed with 
the republicans 
the campaign that jesse helms is running is not a lot 
different than the campaign that david duke ran in louisiana 
gephardt said duke is a former ku klux klan leader who lost in 
louisianas open senate primary in october 
the message clearly has racial overtones it is clearly 
designed to appeal to peoples prejudice gephardt said on nbcs 
meet the press 
in the helmsgantt contest democrats also have charged helms 
with playing on racial stereotypes in television advertisements 
white house chief of staff john sununu insisted the bush 
administration and the gop oppose any use of race in elections 
i think in any campaign a racial message of one kind or the 
other is inappropriate and abhorrent sununu said this 
administration has worked awfully hard to get that kind of aspect 
out of any campaign 
sununu noted that the republican hierarchy including president 
bush had disavowed duke but he sidestepped questions about helms 
for whom bush has campaigned 
black said the democrats charges were old hat 
you can always tell when the democrats are about to have a bad 
political year because the weekend before the election they start 
acting like martyrs and screaming racism and voter intimidation 
he said 
at mondays hearings in newark the federal judge is expected to 
examine whether the rnc violated a 1982 decree issued after the 
party reportedly hired armed guards to watch over various polling 
places in new jersey

belgium called sunday for a special 
european community meeting to discuss the threat to unity posed by 
a slew of missions to baghdad to try to obtain the release of 
hostages 
iraqi president saddam hussein is creating this royal court of 
all sorts of western pilgrims who visit him to obtain the release 
of hostages belgian foreign minister mark eyskens told brt 
television 
iraq has held thousands of foreigners hostage since its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait it has moved some to strategic locations to 
serve as shields against attack and released others 
eyskens comments came after he was asked about former west 
german chancellor willy brandts scheduled trip to to iraq on 
monday 
he said sometimes visiting officials or exofficials let 
themselves be lured into political discussions with saddam such 
talks he said could jeopardize the united stand against 
iraqs takeover of kuwait 
eyskens said he hoped an ec meeting could strengthen the allies 
position on such initiatives he said the meeting requested by 
belgium and the netherlands could be held tuesday or wednesday in 
rome when the trade blocs foreign minister gather for an 
unrelated ceremony 
ec officials in rome could not confirm when or if the meeting 
would take place 
eyskens noted that the 12 community states had agreed last week 
to refrain from solitary missions to iraq in order to maintain the 
trade blocs credibility and cohesion days later brandts trip 
was announced 
we just decided on a clear position that there would be no 
government delegations directly or indirectly traveling to iraq 
to negotiate about the hostages said eyskens 
germany maintained brandts visit remained within the ec 
framework since he would would work for the release of all foreign 
hostages not just germans the bonn government defended brandts 
trip again sunday saying it wished him success 
in another such visit former japanese prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone met with saddam on sunday he said afterward it was too 
soon to tell if his efforts would help win the hostages freedom 
but the visit was potentially embarrassing for japan nakasone 
emerged from the talks saying saddam appeared to be earnest in his 
wish for peace hours later iraqs information minister told 
reporters iraq would go to war rather than give up kuwait 
iraqs official news agency also said nakasone had told saddam 
the japanese parliament was unlikely to approve the sending of 
japanese troops to the gulf nakasone did not disclose any such 
assurances but the report made it appear that japan might be 
willing to make concessions for its citizens freedom 
eyskens said even if visits like brandts and nakasones were 
technically private ones saddam was well aware of the influence 
such figures have 
when an important expolitician goes to baghdad to talk with 
saddam it inevitably has a political character he said 
increasingly more tiny cracks appear in the western front 
because of such initiatives 
eyskens also criticized former british prime minister edward 
heath for his visit to iraq last month he secured the release of 
33 britons and 14 us citizens but the belgian official said 
there was a price 
following heaths trip his views were saddam isnt all that 
bad we have to talk with him his territorial claims on kuwait 
can be partially defended that is language which is not conform 
to the western front eyskens said 
iraq last week freed more than 250 french hostages while 
praising what it said were frances goodfaith efforts to settle 
the crisis

its probably the only such football 
field in the world covered by sand with cotfilled tents running 
along one sideline but the marines on a rare day off sunday didnt 
mind the dust 
its fun a good way to let out aggressions said lance cpl 
dale tom keller 20 of prineville ore its better than 
sitting back at camp doing nothing 
rest and relaxation for the 220000 us troops confronting iraq 
in the persian gulf has become more important with operation desert 
shield in its third month and no end in sight 
saudi arabia is the first potential combat zone where some 
traditional sldiers diversions visiting area bars and dating 
the locals are banned 
in their absence sports have become an important recreation 
especially for the 30000 marines unlike their army and air force 
counterparts the marines are barred from saudi cities to keep a 
low profile 
the marines play football in a stadium at a base turned over to 
them by the saudi government every game is called the scud bowl 
apparently after scud missiles which are part of the iraqi arsenal 
dust bowl would be more like it 
even though clouds of dust partially obscured some of the play 
the 100 fans at sundays main battle between the 174th marine wing 
support squadron and the 311th marine fighter attack squadron 
yelled just like fans at home 
they cheered good passes and touchdowns booed interceptions 
and shouted at the referee for calls they didnt like 
the marines were playing flag football a variation of touch 
football in which tackles are made by grabbing strips worn by the 
opposing team highlights of the game which the 311th won 1514 
were broadcast on the armed forces radio network 
most fans sat in the stadium on one side of the field but some 
stood outside a long row of tents running the length of the other 
side just a few yards from the players 
just step right out and watch the game said lance cpl 
ellory myers 20 of casper wyo whose tent is on the 40yard 
line 
its a good bonus except when it wakes you up he said 
its kind of fun especially when people get in fights and 
stuff 
ringside seat said master sgt dan rich 38 of rochester 
new york a maintenance chief with the 311th tom cats you get to 
holler at everybody its good for relieving stress 
but not everyone cares for the tentside view though 
lance cpl wayne lewis 21 of reading penn who lives on the 
50yard line said he wasnt interested in football and was annoyed 
the marines hadnt put up the tents elsewhere 
you get a lot of dust in your house and they wake me up 
around 8 am he said 
chief warrant officer jerry l duck 36 of malden miss was 
celebrating a 160 shutout by officers over the enlisted men from 
his unit in the 311th 
for an old man i did all right he said it helps the 
morale i think the stadium is the best place in the country 
this is great said sgt john crone 23 of york penn a 
photographer for the 174th a lot of marines out here have it 
really bad off theyre out in the sand and the dirt i kind of 
feel guilty sometimes 
the stadium also has volleyball nets a softball diamond 
pingpong tables and movies 
capt cindy stock 29 a flight nurse from pope air force base 
nc was wearing shorts sunday its one of the very few places 
we can wear them which makes it doubly nice for women she said 
us soldiers have been advised to try not to offend local 
residents in saudi arabia the moslem way of life dictates that 
women not drive or expose their skin to public view 
sweating in a tshirt and shorts during a break in another game 
lance cpl darren ortiz of new york city said it was like playing 
on the beach you can run as hard as you can but you wont move 
nowhere that fast

syrian tanks and the lead elements of 
a infantry division landed sunday in saudi arabia to join the arab 
forces sent to the region in response to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
saudi prince khalid commander of all arab troops deployed in 
the sands south of iraq and kuwait saluted and warmly greeted the 
syrian troops 
we are all here to fight if its necessary said khalid 
commander of the saudi air force and nephew of king fahd 
we are all in the same line khalid said at a dockside news 
conference it is really a pleasure to have a syrian armored 
division here that makes me very happy 
the syrian troops will be under the saudi flag the prince 
said but he noted they have a direct line to their president 
hafez assad 
maj gen ali habib commander of syrian troops in saudi arabia 
refused to answer questions but a spokesman said between 2500 and 
3000 troops were aboard the cargo ship saudi qassim the remaining 
elements of the 15000member 9th armored division would arrive in 
the next few weeks saudi officials said 
the syrian vanguard consisted of sovietmade t62 tanks which 
are standard fighting armor for syria but not the topoftheline 
model sold by moscow the iraqis have 500 t72 tanks which have 
more firepower and range 
ten of the tanks were parked in formation on trailers their 
fourman tank crews and a company of 120 infantrymen carrying 
chemical masks and ak47 assault rifles snapped to attention 
two tanks roared off the cargo vessel following a stiffgaited 
color guard and members of the ships crew said 145 tanks remained 
in the belly of the ship syria has pledged to send 270 tanks 
the syrians also brought radarguided antiaircraft vehicles 
the tanks which sailed a week ago from the mediterranean port 
of tartous are the first syrian armor to be sent the armor will 
reinforce 4000 ground troops who earlier planted their battle flag 
alongside fellow arabs in the saudi sands 
the original force was made up of elite special forces who have 
fought the israelis and others in lebanon 
when asked if he thought syrian troops would fight iraqis 
khalid said lets hope they can be used to prevent war 
he called their arrival a great contribution from a brother 
country to defend the kingdom about 300000 troops mostly 
americans make up the multinational force 
khalid spoke in arabic to the syrian troops saying that iraqs 
aug 2 conquest of kuwait was wrong and would be punished by god 
there is one who sees everything khalid said according to 
an intepreter we are all sure his hand will come very soon

the 50th anniversary of the closing of 
angel island gateway into the united states for thousands of 
chinese immigrants wont be marked with the flourish that 
celebrated the restoration of ellis island 
both islands were immigration stations ellis island in new york 
harbor and angel island in san francisco bay 
but no statue of liberty greeted the 175000 chinese who 
immigrated via angel island between 1910 and 1940 
angel island is regarded by many chinese not as a gateway but as 
a prison where many were held for months before being allowed 
entrance to the united states in fact it is near alcatraz the 
island prison 
for them the closing of the station on nov 5 1940 represents 
a first step toward the healing process said paul chow whose 
father was kept on angel island for six months 
no big event was planned to commemorate mondays anniversary 
but neither does the chinese community want to forget 
i think it would be a big mistake to forget said phil choy 
a san francisco architect whose father immigrated from china 
a small celebration was planned on the mainland to remember the 
islands place in us immigration history chow said 
chow has led volunteer tours of the angel island barracks for 18 
years and has been the leader of a historical advisory committee 
that has fought to restore the site the island is maintained as a 
park and is accessible by ferry 
he invited immigration officials on a tour recently to urge them 
to include the island in a centennial celebration next year of the 
founding of the immigration and naturalization service 
having seen it wed like to do something to let people know 
more about it said connie mackey codirector of the ins 
centennial committee 
a 1980 collection of poems titled island records poetry 
the chinese carved into the walls of their wooden barracks 
and a documentary called carved in silence after the poems 
started distribution in 1988 
in the documentary lee puey you described her first encounter 
with the united states i had to take off all my clothes it was 
so embarrassing and shameful for me back in china i never had to 
take off everything but it was different here in america i found 
it very strange

african sports officials opened the door 
sunday for south africas return to the international arena once 
apartheid is ended 
they cautioned however at the close of their first direct 
meeting with south africa sports organizers that nonnegotiable 
conditions for reentry will take time to put into effect 
a communique specified that south african participants will not 
be allowed back into olympic or international sports until the 
apartheid system of racial separation is completely eradicated 
and south africas disparate and segregated sports bodies are 
merged under nonracial banners 
there can be no concessions on this jean claude ganga of 
the congo told reporters after reading the communique 
ganga presided over the harare gathering of 43 representatives 
of all major south african sports organizations and 14 officials of 
the african branch of the international olympic committee 
the association of national olympic committees of africa the 
main african olympic organization set up two steering committees 
charged with promoting and monitoring an end to apartheid in south 
african sports 
we are happy with the discussions the door has not been 
slammed shut said sam ramsamy chief of the south african 
nonracial olympic committee 
the participants agreed to establish an eightmember committee 
to coordinate reforms inside south africa in liaison with an 
african monitoring committee scheduled to hold its first meeting in 
march 
ganga said the africans were encouraged that a new era of 
dialogue with the south africans and among south african sports 
people themselves was beginning 
he said the south africans showed willingness to work toward 
their countrys return to the global sporting arena 
i am convinced this is possible it might take some time but 
it is possible ganga said 
he is president of the association of national olympic 
committees of africa he said the international olympic committee 
asked his organization to review the 20year international sports 
boycott of south africa 
south african sports organizers say political reforms introduced 
in south africa this year by president fw de klerk have improved 
their countrys image enough to allow for an easing of world sports 
bans imposed by the ioc in 1970 
continuing reforms toward dismantling apartheid should enable 
south africans to compete in the 1992 olympics the south africans 
say 
but african sports officials believe the pace of reform could 
admit south african athletes to the 1996 centenary games in atlanta 
only if legalized racial segregation is abolished completely by 
then 
de klerk head of south africas whiteled government has 
launched a program of social and political reform he is

an archaeologist will resume digging at 
a site used by some of north americas earliest human inhabitants 
under an agreement with indians concerned about what will be done 
with artifacts or human remains 
the agreement was signed friday by state officials landowner 
dr mack richey the confederated colville tribes and michael 
gramly dig director and curator of anthropology at the museum of 
science in buffalo ny 
gramly has a state permit to excavate the 11200yearold site 
which has yielded stone and bone tools made in the style attributed 
to the socalled clovis people clovis remains identified by a 
particular style of fluted spear point are named for a town in new 
mexico where they were first identified in the 1930s 
the dig scheduled to resume last month was put on hold when 
the colvilles contended that gramlys work in the orchard might 
disturb an ancestral burial ground they also expressed concern 
about what would happen to any artifacts found 
under fridays agreement gramly is to provide the colvilles 
with a list and photographs of all artifacts found at the site the 
state will pay a tribe member to be at the site while digging is 
under way for consultation about artifacts unearthed there 
gramly has said there is little possibility the site contains 
human remains and questions whether anyone now living can claim an 
ancestral link to the clovis people 
but he appeared pleased with the agreement 
a few days ago i had had it today im a little happier and 
maybe a little humbled im believing in human beings again he 
said 
but he contended that the problems that have stalled his project 
may hinder funding for future efforts in the state 
the agreement signed friday will allow removal of 17 artifacts 
uncovered in a 1988 dig and completion of an exploratory trench 
gramly said he will remove some bone artifacts as soon as they 
are dry enough to be lifted he said digging and site tours will 
continue over the next two to three weeks

candidates in tuesdays congressional and 
gubernatorial elections hurtled through a final weekend of 
campaigning sunday while party leaders posted rival predictions of 
success 
republicans were heartened by a string of public opinion polls 
trending in their favor and expressed optimism about the california 
governors race the biggest prize of the midterm campaign 
democrats remained confident of solid gains in both congress and 
the statehouses 
in california republican gubernatorial candidate pete wilson 
shuttled to a series of public rallies while democrat dianne 
feinstein visited churches in poor and minority areas of san 
francisco 
feinstein told parishioners it was wilson who broke the back 
of the 1990 civil rights bill with his senate vote sustaining 
president bushs veto of that bill two weeks ago 
wilson buoyed by recent polls giving him a slight lead in the 
race condemned feinstein for pathetic campaign tactics 
designed to divide the state on racial and class lines 
in the nations most closely watched senate race gop sen jesse 
helms passed up church services in favor of extra rest democratic 
rival harvey gantt attended services and scheduled an evening 
rally 
not surprisingly officials in both parties predicted success 
when the votes are counted and defined the term to their 
advantage 
ron brown chairman of the democratic national committee said 
his party would pick up governor seats were going to pick up in 
the senate and were going to pick up in the house 
white house chief of staff john sununu conceded democrats would 
retain control of both the house and senate in the 102nd congress 
and perhaps pad their majorities in both houses 
but he quickly added what we have set as a goal is to be 
significantly better than the average result in an offyear 
election and if we do that it will be a success historically 
the party controlling the white house loses roughly two dozen house 
seats in the election midway through the presidents first term 
a nationwide new york timescbs survey depicted an electorate 
pessimistic about the economy and unhappy with its government and 
the pundits said they were wary of making predictions 
definitely a yogi berra year which is it isnt over till its 
over democratic pollster peter hart said on cable news networks 
newsmaker sunday 
one thing was for certain it was almost over 
at stake in tuesdays balloting are 34 senate seats a new 
435member house and 36 governorships more than 6100 legislative 
races are on the ballot and voters in 43 states and the district 
of columbia will decide the fate of hundreds of ballot initiatives 
adding spice to the mix was increased interest in the state 
legislative races an estimated 19 house seats will move from 
northern and midwestern industrial states to the sun belt before 
1992 and millions have been spent to maximize each partys 
strength in the state legislatures that will redraw the house 
district boundaries 
floridas gubernatorial candidates campaigned on network 
television 
were saying no new taxes next year said republican gov 
bob martinez appearing on abcs this week with david brinkley 
and thats where lawton chiles says we need them 
countered chiles the leader in one late preelection poll 
well i think that i dont agree right now that you have to have 
new revenue 
fresh polls pointed to a republican trend in close races to pick 
governors in kansas and ohio and even massachusetts where a 
survey showed william weld in a tightening race with democrat john 
silber 
minnesota sen rudy boschwitz counted as among the gops 
endangered incumbents held an apparently widening edge over 
democrat paul wellstone according to a survey of voters in their 
state 
but a new survey in texas suggested democrat ann richards was 
gaining on republican oilman clayton williams 
bush spent the day in houston where he attended church with 
williams and arranged to speak by phone to rallies in alaska utah 
nebraska and maryland 
the election could be won or lost depending on who gets out to 
the polls bush said in a audio link with a rally for gop senate 
candidate hal daub in nebraska daub is seeking to unseat 
democratic sen james exon who leads in the polls 
i need more support from congress bush said his standard 
campaign message that if republicans could wrest control of 
congress from democrats we would control the agenda we wouldnt 
be playing on the defense 
after raising 85 million for republican candidates in tuesdays 
elections the presidents travel schedule has been curtailed in 
recent days some republicans disagree with his decision to embrace 
higher taxes as part of a deficitreduction agreement 
the politicians and the pundits made the rounds of the sundays 
network interview programs generally agreeing that democrats would 
retain control of the senate and house and emerge from tuesdays 
elections with more governorships than the republicans 
but beyond there there was little consensus 
house majority leader richard gephardt of missouri predicted on 
nbcs meet the press that democrats would pick up six or seven 
house seats and two or three in the senate 
sununu in a combative interview on the same network said the 
party could lose between four and 12 seats in the house and 
predicted the two sides would breakeven plus or minus one in 
the senate races 
sen john breaux chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee predicted no net change in the current 5545 democratic 
majority in the senate 
republican party spokesman charles black said republican losses 
would be held to a handful in the house and said he believes the 
gop could eke out a gain of seats in the senate 
the new york timescbs survey of 1445 adults reported that 
nearly four in 10 people surveyed expect things to get worse in the 
country only three in 10 expect them to improve 
twothirds of those responding believe the economy is in bad 
shape and 77 percent believe government is run by special interests 
looking out for themselves

scientists from about 100 countries said 
policymakers should take immediate action against global warming 
and that no nation has economic or technical problems that prevent 
it from contributing to the effort 
the panel of about 700 experts meeting for a un climate 
conference unanimously said that over the past decade a clear 
scientific consensus has emerged on global warming expected to 
occur in the next century 
the report is intended to be used by policymakers it set few 
targets but environmentalists said its conclusions provide another 
spur for the united states to act 
washington says more research is needed before targets can be 
agreed for cutting emissions of heattrapping greenhouse gases 
the conference report finished late saturday will be forwarded 
to a landmark meeting of ministers in geneva from monday to 
wednesday heads of government due to attend include prime 
ministers margaret thatcher of britain and michel rocard of france 
king hussein of jordan is also expected 
the ministers are due to give formal blessing to the launching 
of global negotiations on warming scheduled for february 
daniel becker of the washingtonbased sierra club said 
environmental groups welcomed the very strong statement by the 
scientists but that the draft ministerial declaration remained 
under a cloud 
officials drafting the declaration sunday remained locked in 
sharp differences of approach mainly between washington and the 
european community which urges quick action the ec wants to 
stabilize carbon dioxide output at current levels by the year 2000 
and a commitment to reductions after that 
the scientific panel included members from the united states and 
the soviet union the two biggest contributors of manmade carbon 
dioxide 
the gas much of which is released by burning fossil fuels is 
believed to account for more than half of the heattrapping 
greenhouse effect that causes global warming 
countries are urged to take immediate actions to control the 
risks of climate change with initial emphasis on actions that would 
be economically and socially beneficial for other reasons as 
well the report said 
it said technically feasible and costeffective opportunities 
exist to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in all countries 
more research is needed but remaining uncertainties should not 
delay action the report said 
the final version of the report said many industrialized 
countries can reduce their carbon dioxide output by at least 20 
percent by 2005 soviet scientists objected to an earlier draft 
that said most instead of many 
drawing on numerous published studies the experts again 
outlined the climate upheaval that global warming could cause 
these include flooding of vast coastal areas and islands as sea 
levels rise global warming is also fear as a threat to farming 
forests and fishing 
apart from carbon dioxide the report cites chlorofluorocarbons 
and methane as major greenhouse contributors 
scientists believe that if nothing is done to curb them 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heattrapping gases could 
boost global temperatures 54 degrees by the end of the next 
century the fastest rise in 10000 years

the last thing democratic voter malissia johnson 
expected sunday afternoon was a call from president bush but even 
in her surprise she says she never told him shed vote for 
republican clayton williams 
i said i would vote i didnt say who i was going to vote 
for in the texas gubernatorial race she told the associated 
press after bush called her from a getoutthevote phone bank 
as it turns out she said shes voting for williams democratic 
opponent ann richards 
that wasnt the impression the grinning president bush gave 
reporters who watched him call mrs johnson after phoning a handful 
of registered republicans to encourage them to vote for williams 
the gop gubernatorial candidate 
a reporter dared bush him to pick a name from the phone book at 
random after he went through names provided on cards by the gop 
campaign workers 
bush grabbed the book and picked out mrs johnson who said she 
makes 70 every two weeks caring for elderly people in their homes 
she and her retired husband who suffered a stroke two years ago 
support themselves on that salary and his social security she 
said 
bush was beaming when he hung up the telephone giving the 
impression that he had happened upon a williams voter although he 
didnt actually say so 
but mrs williams contacted later said she wouldnt vote for 
williams in tuesdays election because im not a republican 
asked what she thought of williams to whom bush has devoted 
considerable campaign time she said im just not going to vote 
for him thats all 
furthermore she said she did not vote for bush in 1988 but 
cast her ballot for his democratic opponent michael dukakis 
nonetheless she was excited to get the presidents call 
although at first she thought it might be a trick 
i didnt have an idea that he would call 
what does she think of bushs performance as president 
i guess hes doing all right the best he can hes ok i 
guess she said

president bush worked the telephones hard sunday 
calling british prime minister margaret thatcher five republican 
candidates around the country and a houston woman whose name he 
picked from the phone book on a dare 
you wont believe this but this is the president of the 
united states he told a woman he identified as mary johnson of 
houston im just doing a little work at the polls at the 
polling operation trying to get people out to vote 
bush told the woman he hoped she would vote for republican 
gubernatorial candidate clayton williams as well as for other 
republicans 
will you he asked in apparent albeit misplaced delight at 
her response 
the woman told reporters later that she was a registered 
democrat had voted for democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis in 1988 and planned to vote for democratic texas 
gubernatorial candidate ann richards 
i just told him i was going to vote ms johnson told the 
associated press i didnt tell him who i was going to vote 
for 
bush made the call as he spent a lowkey day pursuing both 
diplomacy and politics by telephone in his adopted hometown where 
he will vote on tuesday 
in the morning he phoned mrs thatcher for what white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said was a discussion of persian 
gulf strategy 
he also made pep talks by phone to separate rallies for two gop 
candidates in nebraska and one each in utah maryland and alaska 
but his most unusual call of the day came as he and williams 
attended a gop getoutthevote center and bush joined volunteers 
in manning a phone bank 
after calling a half dozen voters from a list of republicans 
given to him by party workers a reporter suggested that bush pick 
a number at random 
bush grabbed the book picking out a name and saying this may 
be tough this is risky 
needless to say id appreciate it if you could vote for our 
full ticket bush told the woman i hate to call you on sunday 
but i was just out here believing in participating in the 
political process i dont know if youre registered but if you 
are i hope youll go to the polls and i hope youll vote for our 
ticket he said 
he told the woman they dared me to open the book and just 
pick out a number and youre up at the top of the page and 
so thank you i hope i didnt impose on your family 
bush was less talkative when it came to reporters questions 
no questions today its sunday been to church i cant 
do it too tired today bush said when reporters persisted 
dealing with a congress completely controlled by democrats is 
not an easy assignment the president said in an audio linkup 
with a rally in plattsmouth neb for republican senate candidate 
hal daub 
earlier bush took williams to services at st martins 
episcopal church with him on sunday morning he also planned to 
campaign for williams in three texas cities on monday here tyler 
and waco richards hometown 
the president made short upbeat remarks in a succession of 
afternoon phone calls to campaign workers at rallies across the 
nation steering away from controversial issues like his support 
of a package including new tax increases 
to the hal daub for senate rally bush said this election 
could be won or lost depending who gets out to the polls 
daub a former house member is seeking to unseat democratic 
sen james exon who has been leading in recent polls 
i need more support from congress bush said delivering his 
traditional campaign message that if republicans could wrest 
control of congress from democrats we would control the agenda 
we wouldnt be playing on the defense 
bsh also telephoned a rally for nebraska republican gov kay 
orr who is in a tight race with democratic challenger ben nelson 
speaking to campaign workers in salt lake city for republican 
congressional candidate genevieve atwood bush attacked the tax 
and spend mentality of the democrats 
good luck on tuesday dont take anything for granted he 
told her 
and speaking to a rally in salisbury md for republican 
congressional challenger wayne gilcrest bush said dont let 
them tell you no one can make a difference 
bush concluded his messages including one to alaska on behalf 
of gop gubernatorial candidate arliss sturgulewski by saying 
over and out 
the president was giving his most visible support to williams in 
the hardfought texas gubernatorial race he was to campaign for 
williams on monday in waco ann richards home town as well as 
in tyler and in houston 
williams meanwhile defended himself against criticism by 
richards for not paying any income taxes in 1986 
i was fighting for my life in 1986 i didnt pay any tax 
because i didnt have any income williams told reporters after 
he went to church with bush he blamed his troubles on the economic 
downturn that affected the state from thenplunging oil prices 
i dont understand ann richards she must have been somewhere 
else in 1986 williams said 
he welcomed bushs campaign help but said the president hadnt 
given him any advice for winning in the final stretch of what has 
been a tight and acrimonious campaign 
meanwhile john sununu bushs chief of staff disputed 
contentions that bushs decline in popularity and his wavering in 
tax and budget deliberations were costing republicans support 
interviewed from houston on nbctvs meet the press program 
sununu conceded that the white house had made some mistakes in 
budget and campaign strategy but sought to minimize them saying 
we all make mistakes 
sununu predicted republicans would around breakeven plus or 
minus one in the senate and in the house would lose from four to 
12 seats 
sununu denied that the president was seeking to politicize the 
persian gulf crisis by repeatedly issuing bellicose rhetoric aimed 
at saddam on the campaign trail 
the crisis is at the top of the national agenda and the 
president needs to talk about it regardless of the forum sununu 
said

after 10 years working on cars shumway found he was appalled at 
the common practices of spilling used oil and antifreeze down the 
drain venting ozonedestroying gas from air conditioners into the 
atmosphere and dumping empty oil cans into the trash 
the singlequart oil containers would be overflowing into the 
road he said i couldnt stomach this 
last year shumway bought an auto repair shop near tysons 
corner an affluent shopping district in the washington suburbs at 
first he concentrated on building a reputation for quality car 
repair then launched the new name and new concept on jan 1 1990 
the most important difference between ecotech and the 
traditional repair shop shumway said is the way he disposes of 
waste fluids and gases 
i dont know if the public realizes that auto servicing is the 
no 1 cause of preventable cfc release shumway said 
chlorofluorocarbons found in the freon gas coolant of air 
conditioners are blamed for causing a hole in the earths layer of 
protective ozone 
a portable red box in shumways shop a robinair refrigerant 
recovery and recycling system ingests the freon and cleanses it 
so it can later be injected into another customers air 
conditioner 
theres no reason every shop shouldnt have one he said 
but theyre not cheap they cost about 3000 
most auto repair places simply vent the freon into the air 
replacing it with new canned gas one provision of this years 
clean air legislation however will require shops to begin 
recycling air conditioner coolant by 1993 
another rolling recycling machine in shumways shop processes 
antifreeze fluid used oil goes into an oilfired heater that 
replaced electrical heaters in the shop shumway buys oil in bulk 
rather than in onequart cans he recycles cans bottles paper 
cardboard and used metal parts 
all were throwing away is a little bit of plastic he said 
pete minetree of vienna va one of shumways customers said 
hes pleased to know his cars used antifreeze and oil arent 
damaging the environment 
ill tell you the truth hes more expensive than others but 
its worthwhile minetree said the effect of what hes doing 
if everybody did it would be tremendous but somebodys got to 
lead in this and hes doing it 
and those hanging spider plants partly decorative partly 
functional 
these are test plants to see how they survive in a harsh 
environment shumway said i think they serve to clean up the 
air plus they look nice 
if all goes well he said we may bring more in and turn this 
into a jungle canopy 
since the environmental transformation the shops business has 
doubled shumway reports he has four employees has just taken on 
a partner and is prospecting for a second location in maryland 
this is off and running he said i get people from 50 
miles away sometimes i think 80 percent of my new customers come 
because of these recycling machines people want to do the right 
thing

in a new outburst of belligerence iraq said sunday it was ready 
to fight a dangerous war rather than ever give up kuwait one 
european official warned that divisions over the hostage issue are 
endangering the antiiraq alliance 
iraq is not going to negotiate on kuwait iraqs information 
minister latif jassim told a news conference in baghdad he 
insisted iraqs annexation of kuwait which it overran three months 
ago would stand 
we are going to defend our 19th province on any condition 
even if we have to fight a dangerous war he said referring to 
kuwait 
iraq also said it was recalling an unspecified number of retired 
army officers to active duty 
secretary of state james a baker iii visited us troops in the 
saudi desert earlier sunday and said it was hard to say whether 
they would be called into combat the presidents of egypt and 
france expressed hopes that economic pressure rather than military 
might could force iraq out of kuwait 
meanwhile four american exhostages were on their way home a 
day after being freed and fifteen europeans arrived in jordan 
after being released by the iraqis they were among thousands of 
foreigners were trapped in iraq and kuwait when saddam husseins 
troops took over the emirate aug 2 
the first pows of the persian gulf crisis three french 
soldiers had a homecoming of their own in paris on sunday but it 
wasnt exactly a heros welcome french officials have said the 
soldiers who were captured last week might have strayed into 
iraqi territory and that they probably face punishment for their 
carelessness 
the new iraqi vow to keep kuwait at all costs came only hours 
after a former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone met with 
saddam and said the iraqi president had demonstrated great 
earnestness and seriousness about seeking peace 
nakasones visit aimed at winning the release of japanese 
hostages comes as japanese lawmakers are considering a plan to 
send troops to the gulf to join the multinational force arrayed 
against saddam 
the troopdeployment proposal has drawn strong criticism from 
those who say it would violate japans postwar peace constitution 
even though the troops would be confined to noncombat roles 
iraqs official news agency said nakasone had told saddam it was 
unlikely lawmakers would approve the proposal nakasone speaking 
to reporters made no mention of such assurances but the report 
underscored the way the hostages can be used as leverage 
belgiums foreign minister complained that efforts by individual 
nations to win their citizens freedom are eroding unity against 
iraq 
saddam is creating this royal court of all sorts of western 
pilgrims who visit him to obtain the release of hostages the 
belgian official mark eyskens said in a television interview 
sunday in brussels 
sometimes the visitors let themselves be lured into political 
discussions with saddam which could jeopardize the united 
stand against saddams invasion and annexation of kuwait he 
said 
belgium requested a special european community meeting on the 
matter on tuesday or wednesday in rome 
the european community had already tried to discourage a 
hostagefreeing bid by former west german chancellor willy brandt 
who leaves for baghdad on monday like nakasones trip brandts is 
a private mission with government backing 
three of the four americans freed by iraq on saturday flew into 
london sunday night on their way home a us embassy official in 
jordan said the fourth michael barner 49 of woodsworth la 
made other private arrangements for returning home 
former hostages dr abdul hamid kangi 50 an indianborn 
american from glencoe ill randall trinh 49 of hacienda 
heights calif and raymond gales a diplomat from the besieged 
us embassy in kuwait were met at heathrow airport by us 
officials from the london embassy 
the three were reluctant to speak to reporters 
trinh clutching his stomach said i am too sick to say 
anything now the main thing i am looking forward to when i get 
home to the us is to be with my family 
he confirmed he had been held at an unspecified installation as 
part of saddams human shield policy it was terrible he 
said but he did not elaborate 
some americans and other westerners have been held at stategic 
installations in iraq to deter any foreign air attack 
the europeans freed by iraq on sunday were 14 germans and one 
belgian all men the german embassy said they were granted exit 
visas after their work contracts ended 
baker who arrived in the region sunday to start his latest 
mideast mission said it wasnt possible to say now whether the 
gulf crisis would explode into war 
the main question is what the future holds he told 
reporters after visiting with troops in the eastern saudi desert 
that is something that cannot be answered with any specificity 
baker has said he is trying to lay the foundation for stronger 
economic and political measures against iraq including possible 
military action 
french president francois mitterrand who met sunday in egypt 
with president hosni mubarak said he hoped it would not come to 
that 
the powerful countries have to strictly enforce the embargo to 
avoid a destructive war he said referring to un sanctions 
against iraq mubarak agreed saying the sanctions were the best 
means of avoiding bloodshed 
in iraq a foreign ministry source said sunday two hostile 
aircraft had penetrated iraqi airspace from saudi arabia on 
saturday there was no immediate response from us and saudi 
officials who have denied reports of similar incursions in the 
past 
the baghdad government stressing its willingness to fight 
announced sunday it was recalling some retired army officers to 
duty it did not say how many 
iraq has an estimated 430000 troops in southern iraq and 
kuwait confronting about 300000 troops in the usdominated 
multinational force in the gulf region 
about 2500 syrian troops arrived in saudi arabia on sunday 
joining an estimated 4000 syrians aleady deployed as part of the 
multinational effort they brought with them about 150 tanks the

gubernatorial candidate dianne feinstein 
hammered sunday on pete wilsons vote against the civil rights act 
and wilson accused feinstein of trying to divide californians along 
racial and class lines 
feinstein a former san francisco mayor toured a half dozen 
churches in minority and poor san francisco bay area neighborhoods 
accompanied by democratic national committee chairman ron brown 
wilson a republican from southern california made a final swing 
through the farm country of the san joaquin valley 
feinstein told parishioners at st paul of the shipwreck roman 
catholic church in san francisco that wilson broke the back of 
the 1990 civil rights bill wilson cast his senate vote to 
sustain president bushs veto of the bill which the president said 
would lead to racial hiring quotas 
supporters said the bill was intended to overturn a series of 
us supreme court decisions that hampered affirmative action 
programs and to ban racial harassment in the workplace 
she slammed wilson and republicans in general on education 
social security and abortion rights 
she received an occasional amen from the 200 churchgoers as 
she declared that california had become the cocaine and heroin 
capital of the world during the tenure of republicans george 
deukmejian as governor and wilson as senator 
wilson condemned feinsteins campaign tactics as he visited 
local republican headquarters in bakersfield fresno and modesto to 
rally volunteers for a final getoutthevote effort 
there is something a little pathetic in a campaign that 
depends upon dividing california dividing the cities against the 
rural areas the rich against the poor and the black against the 
white wilson said 
that is i think frankly a losing tactic and deserves to 
be he said referring to a feinstein television commercial that 
claims he votes for tax breaks for millionaires but raised 
taxes on the middle class 
were not going to revert to the tired stale threadbare 
bromides of the 1930s he told about 200 volunteers at his 
campaigns bakersfield headquarters we dont seek to set one 
group of californians against another to the contrary the change 
we stand for is going to unite california

iran claimed sunday that iraq still holds 
hundreds of iranian prisoners of war despite baghdads assertion 
it has freed all its captives of the eightyear persian gulf war 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted hojatoleslam 
akbar abutorabi spiritual leader ayatollah ali khameneis 
representative for pow affairs as saying tehran has submitted a 
list of 231 iranians still held in iraq to the international 
committee of the red cross 
we have countless documents proving that many more iranian 
pows are still held in iraq he declared 
the iraniraq war was halted by a unbrokered ceasefire in 
august 1988 but the exchange of prisoners was delayed because of 
deadlocked peace negotiations 
the exchange finally began aug 17 after iraqi president saddam 
hussein made peace overtures to iran reports at the time said 
saddam was trying to woo his old enemy to bolster his position in 
the international confrontation over his aug 2 invasion of kuwait

a 29yearold man was convicted sunday of 
killing three suburban kansas city women whose bodies never were 
found after they disappeared in the summer of 1989 
a jury deliberated 12 hours over two days before convicting 
richard grissom jr a painting contractor of three counts 
firstdegree murder he was charged in the disappearances of joan 
marie butler 24 of overland park and roommates christine rusch 
and theresa brown both 22 of lenexa 
prosecutors alleged that grissom killed the women for a total of 
3600 drawn from their bank accounts they have declined to 
speculate about how they were killed or what happened to their 
bodies 
nothing can bring back their lives so there is a hollowness 
to this victory that will go on forever said dave rusch miss 
ruschs father but were thrilled that this is a complete 
victory except for one charge 
miss browns mother bobby brown said she was elated by the 
verdict 
my main concern now is to know we have richard grissom where 
he belongs im disappointed we havent had a chance to hear him 
speak she said we just have to imagine what hes thinking 
ralph butler the father of miss butler said i hate richard 
grissom 
defense attorney kevin moriarty said richard grissom 
maintains his innocence and we are very disappointed in the 
verdict another defense attorney tom erker said the conviction 
would be appealed 
grissom also was found guilty of one count of aggravated 
kidnapping four counts of robbery one count of aggravated 
burglary and two counts of theft 
grissom didnt show emotion when the verdict was read in johnson 
county district court 
he faces three possible life sentences on the murder 
convictions a hearing on posttrial motions was set for nov 20 
defense attorneys rested their case friday without presenting 
any evidence they had asked judge william gray to dismiss the 
charges saying prosecutors hadnt proved grissom committed any 
crimes or that the women were dead 
but during the 10day trial johnson county district attorney 
paul morrison said the evidence though largely circumstantial was 
enough for conviction 
evidence against grissom included master keys to the womens 
apartments blood stains in miss butlers rental car and personal 
belongings of miss rusch and miss brown found in grissoms car 
morrison also reminded jurors of statements grissom made to 
police when he was arrested at dallasfort worth international 
airport within weeks of the womens disappearances 
officers said grissom told them youll dig them up when 
questioned about the women 
moriarty argued those statements shouldnt be considered because 
there was no tape recording videotape or notes of the eighthour 
session with officers

officials hope to declare victory in a long 
and costly battle against the mediterranean fruit fly this week 
but they said sunday the war against the cropdestroying pest isnt 
over 
no flies have been found during inspections of traps meant to 
sample the population and assess the threat to the states 18 
billion a year farm industry that leads experts to believe the 
medfly is gone for now said roy cunningham chairman of the state 
medfly science advisory panel 
we know people are shipping fruit in all the time illegally 
but the infestation from the previous episode is over cunningham 
said the pest is believed to enter the state in illegally imported 
fruit and vegetables 
state and federal quarantines could be lifted by thursday or 
friday officials said but the longterm war will continue through 
stricter inspection programs and a statesponsored search for 
better traps and lures 
the quarantines were imposed on movement of fruit from infested 
areas mostly in urban and residential sections of southern 
california the big worry was that the flies could spread to 
agricultural areas in the southern part of the state or to the farm 
country in the san joaquin valley to the north 
slightly smaller than a common housefly the medfly lays its 
eggs in softskinned fruits causing the fruit to rot 
the fly has plagued california farmers since the early 1980s 
since july 1989 the state and federal governments have spent 52 
million in a program that included aerial pesticide spraying over a 
500squaremile area to battle the stubborn pest 
the states costliest campaign against the medfly began in 1980 
when 100 million was spent over 27 months in a statewide 
eradication effort quarantines that kept produce from being 
shipped out of state cost california farmers another 100 million 
in the most recent battle some communities were sprayed 
repeatedly with the pesticide malathion generating a loud public 
outcry that included lawsuits and 300 damage claims against the 
state 
the protest left officials leery of another prolonged aerial 
campaign said gera curry spokeswoman for the california 
department of food and agriculture 
this is not our preferred method this is not the best way to 
do it said curry but no one anticipated the explosive nature 
of the infestation last year 
but opponents contend officials are just trying to lull the 
public into complacency 
theyre saying victory because it will calm us down but its 
a political facade said pat reichenberger former mayor of the 
los angeles suburb of monterey park who opposed aerial spraying 
over his community i dont think its over by any means theyll 
be back 
typically infestations are attacked by a single spraying 
followed by the release of millions of sterile flies so that 
propagation declines 
the state resorted to heavy repeated sprayings last summer 
after the supply of sterile flies was exhausted and infestations 
continued to threaten californias fruit industry 
just when victory actually is declared depends on the results of 
recent trap inspections because the length of the medflys life 
cycle varies widely from three weeks to more than a month 
depending upon weather officials want to be certain the flies 
really are gone curry said 
stricter inspection measures will help prevent another massive 
aerial spraying campaign curry said 
researchers are convinced the medfly enters california from 
fruit and vegetables brought in illegally from hawaii and central 
and south america a bill recently passed by the legislature 
authorized the department to begin regular inspection of plane and 
ship cargos coming from overseas curry said 
airlines and shipping firms will pay for the program through 
user fees curry said 
another piece of legislation allocates 750000 for research to 
development alternative methods of fighting the medfly including 
the better traps and lures

a newspaper reported federal prosecutors have 
found evidence indicating that mayor david dinkins backdated a 
letter concerning his sale of cable tv stock to his son as his 
mayoral opponent alleged last year 
mayoral spokesman albert scardino denounced the story in new 
york newsday sunday as shameful and dishonest journalism based 
on unfounded allegations made during the campaign 
the letter became a campaign issue when dinkins gop opponent 
rudolph giuliani questioned whether dinkins had paid appropriate 
federal gift taxes on the transfer of stock in a cable tv company 
to his son 
in 1986 dinkins said he transferred 588 shares of inner city 
broadcasting corp stock stock to his son david dinkins jr at no 
cost 
after giulianis accusation dinkins said he had sold the stock 
to his son and thus wasnt subject to gift tax he released copies 
of the letter from his son dated oct 30 1985 as proof of the 
sale 
newsday quoting an anonymous source close to a grand jury that 
investigated the case said evidence indicates the letter may have 
been written in 1988 or 1989 though investigators were unable to 
prove it conclusively 
in the unnotarized dear dad letter written by hand on lined 
paper dinkins son promised to pay his father 58000 plus 8 
percent annual interest by january 1991 for the stock no payments 
were made as of last year 
tests suggested the letter bore the imprint of a telephone 
number written on another sheet of paper the source said the 
number was of a media company the younger dinkins was unlikely to 
have had dealings with in 1985 when he was a cbs sports producer 
the paper said 
he now is an independent television producer and would have had 
reason to dial the telephone number in 1988 or 1989 the source 
said 
the mayors son who lives in las vegas declined newsdays 
request for an interview 
the federal investigation into the stock transfer ended in july 
without criminal charges but a city probe continues 
us attorney andrew maloney in a confidential report 
summarizing his findings for a special city investigator this july 
said he found substantial evidence the letter was not written 
when dated newsday said 
maloney interviewed by the paper friday declined to comment on 
a grand jury matter 
scardino the mayors spokesman dismissed the story as a rerun 
of unfounded campaign allegations 
it was garbage when it was put out then scardino said it 
was thrown in trash can at attorney generals office but now five 
months later newsday is republishing the same piece of garbage 
dinkins attorney charles stillman called for a probe into how 
the paper obtained information on a federal investigation

nordstrom inc says its closing its remaining 
instore fur salons to put the floor space to better use but 
animal rights activists praised the apparel chains announcement as 
a victory 
the seattlebased retailer will close salons by feb 1 at its 
stores in downtown seattle and suburban bellevue at tysons 
corners and pentagon city near washington dc in san francisco 
and walnut creek calif and in anchorage alaska spokeswoman 
chris bridenbaugh said friday 
fur industry officials said the decision was another sign of 
tough times for furriers who have been hit by overproduction a 
weak economy and warm weather on the west coast 
the decision to close the fur salons is simply due to the 
declining demand we have had for furs in the stores bridenbaugh 
said 
nordstrom wants the space to put other products in that 
customers are requesting to be able to utilize the space better 
she said managers of the individual stores will decide how the 
space will be used she said 
fur salons have been closed at 12 other nordstrom stores in the 
past three years bridenbaugh said nordstrom has 60 stores in 
seven states 
the salons are owned and operated by evans furs of chicago 
which leases floor space from nordstrom 
bridenbaugh said the decision to close the salons was 
nordstroms but david meltzer chairman of evans furs said his 
company made the decision to leave he said the separation was 
amicable and evans may lease space from nordstrom in the future 
weve run their fur departments for a number of years 
meltzer said in a telephone interview weve been increasingly 
dissatisfied with the amount of volume weve been able to 
achieve 
meltzer said nordstrom has tied one hand behind our back in 
terms of advertising of furs without more aggressive 
advertising the salons havent been able to generate enough 
business he said 
nordstroms announcement was cheered by the progressive animal 
welfare society a lynnwoodbased animalrights organization that 
has long campaigned against the sale and wearing of furs 
we know that fur is dead paws spokesman mitchell fox said 
in a news release this is verification that the fur industry is 
dying too we are very pleased with nordstroms trendsetting 
decision to go in this compassionate direction 
paws held a rally saturday outside nordstroms downtown store 
to thank the chain and to kick off its antifur efforts for the 
christmas season about 60 demonstrators passed out leaflets and 
carried signs urging shoppers not to buy or wear furs 
bridenbaugh said nordstrom will continue to sell fur outside of 
the salons such as furtrimmed coats in other departments 
she said fur salons were possible in the future 
meltzer called paws position ridiculous and noted that 
nordstrom sells leather goods and other products made from animals 
their core business is shoes he said 
thomas tashjian an analyst with seidler amdec securities inc 
in los angeles said fur sales were strong in the mid1980s as 
the workingclass woman got more money in her wallet and furs 
were in fashion but he said the market has been relatively flat 
since 
tashjian said there was no way to measure what impact 
animalrights activists might have had but its an issue of 
conversation that wasnt there five years ago when the industry was 
extremely robust 
bill outlaw spokesman for the fur information council in 
washington dc downplayed the effects of animal protection 
groups but he said the shaky economy has hurt the entire retail 
industry especially luxury items such as furs and jewelry 
when you get into difficult economic times people certainly 
start looking at their expenses he said 
meltzer said economic jitters havent affected furs any more 
than other retail segments but both he and outlaw said 
overproduction by fur ranchers in the past year hurt as did the 
weather 
all outerwear sales have been slow on the west coast for the 
past couple of years because the weathers been unseasonably warm 
meltzer said 
he said evans furs decided to pull out of nordstrom stores in 
southern california last year we closed them up because the 
temperature never got below 80 it was beach day every day he 
said 
last year evans furs the nations largest fur retailer lost 
46 million from operations on 140 million in sales and wrote 
off 58 million mostly for closing stores and shrinking its 
organization meltzer said
