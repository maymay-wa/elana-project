convicted killer winford stokes was executed 
by lethal injection friday night for strangling and stabbing a 
woman to death 12 years ago 
both the us supreme court and the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals in st louis denied lastditch requests to block the 
execution friday 
stokes 39 was pronounced dead at 939 pm cdt after receiving 
separate lethal doses of sodium pentathol pavlon and sodium 
chloride at the potosi correctional center 
he lifted his head to look at the iv bag as the first chemical 
was being injected at 935 pm cdt blinked his eyes rapidly and 
lay back on the gurney 
stokes had no last words and had asked for no personal witnesses 
justice has been served this regrettable event is necessary 
to reaffirm the value the state of missouri places on innocent 
human life gov john ashcroft said in a prepared statement 
stokes was sentenced to death after being convicted of capital 
murder in the february 1978 strangling and stabbing of 33yearold 
pamela benda of university city outside st louis authorities 
said stokes who had escaped from a mental hospital killed benda 
after meeting her in a bar and going home with her to have sex 
he also has served time for the 1977 slaying of an elderly st 
louis woman and the fatal shooting of a st louis tavern owner in 
1969 
stokes wife evette met with the condemned man for most of the 
afternoon but left the prison shortly after 6 pm said dale 
riley prison spokesman 
the full 8th us circuit court of appeals had refused friday 
morning to lift the stay attorney general william webster promptly 
turned to the supreme court 
even while the stay was in effect prison officials continued to 
prepare for the execution stokes ordered another last meal his 
second in two days 
riley said stokes ordered catfish french fries cole slaw and a 
twoliter bottle of pepsi he had had his first last meal of 
sirloin steak wild rice and pepsi on thursday 
the supreme court issued its ruling lifting the stay about 715 
pm cdt and sindel promptly asked both the 8th circuit and the 
supreme court to issue a second stay based on other arguments both 
courts refused 
an opinion concurring in the decision was signed by justice 
anthony kennedy chief justice william rehnquist and justice 
antonin scalia 
justice william brennan was joined in a dissenting opinion by 
justices thurgood marshall and harry blackmun 
justice john paul stevens also dissented 
earlier friday another threejudge panel of the 8th circuit 
refused to lift the stay that order was appealed to the full 8th 
circuit 
stokes attorney richard sindel said us district judge 
george gunn jr granted the stay wednesday on the basis of 
arguments contending stokes trial court failed to differentiate 
between felony murder and capital murder in its instructions 
he was the third convict in missouri and the 125th nationally to 
be executed since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing 
states to resume use of the death penalty

sudanese rebels leaders said they captured the town of melut 
defeated its army garrison and controlled traffic on the white nile 
river between two major towns 
the capture would mark one of the sudan peoples liberation 
armys northernmost advances in more than seven years of civil war 
the sudanese government has made no mention of fighting in 
melut 350 miles south of the capital of khartoum there was no 
independent confirmation of the report 
in a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in nairobi the rebel 
movement said it overran melut on thursday in an assault that began 
the day before 
the garrison has been wiped out and remnants are being mopped 
up the broadcast said 
it said the citys capture is important to us because we now 
control river transportation between the towns of renk and 
malakal 
melut is roughly 100 miles from both malakal to the south and 
renk to the north 
the mainly christian and animist rebels launched their rebellion 
in early 1983 demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in 
the three southern provinces of bahr elghazal upper nile and 
equatoria the rebels claim discrimination by the government 
dominated by moslems from the north

a boeing 767 jet outfitted with a star wars 
sensor designed to scan large areas of space and simultaneously 
track hundreds of targets took its first test flight friday 
the modified 767 carried the worlds most sophisticated 
longwave infrared sensor on a sixhour test flight about 45000 
feet above several western states 
a crew of 17 boeing and hughes aircraft co personnel checked 
how inflight vibration and sound will affect the sensor contained 
in an 86footlong cupola over the front half of the plane 
three months of flight testing over the continental united 
states will be followed by tests using air force targets at 
kwajalein atoll in the pacific ocean 
the project called the airborne optical adjunctairborne 
surveillance testbed is to determine if longwave infrared sensors 
can provide early warning and tracking of enemy ballistic missile 
warheads by sorting them from decoys and debris 
the program is intended to test sensor technology rather than 
develop a prototype for an operational system 
it is managed by the us army strategic defense command for the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars 
the program has already cost 600 million and will reach 700 
million if it continues as planned until 1992 col gary stewart of 
the army strategic defense command in huntsville ala said 
thursday 
steward said the program is two years behind schedule and well 
above original cost estimates of 450 million to 500 million

the bush administration is resisting soviet 
offers to cut tactical nuclear weapons at sea but the navys top 
admiral says such negotiations might be useful if the soviets 
accepted certain preconditions 
the united states has long opposed arms control measures that 
would limit the number of navy ships or tactical weapons and adm 
carlisle ah trost soon to retire as chief of naval operations 
told congress on friday he saw little prospect for change 
yet trost said that under certain circumstances it might benefit 
the united states to negotiate the elimination of shortrange naval 
nuclear arms arms in this category include antiship missiles 
depth bombs and torpedoes 
yes it could be in our interests if the soviets were 
willing to also eliminate sea and landbased aircraft assigned to 
their naval fleets and if adequate measures were taken to guard 
against cheating trost told the senate armed services subcommittee 
on projection forces 
but ronald lehman director of the arms control and disarmament 
agency testified that the administration is unwilling to consider 
entering into negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons at sea he 
said it was doubtful that any such accord could include 
satisfactory verification measures 
weve come to the conclusion that now is not the time to 
address the issue he said 
the top arms adviser to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
marshal sergei akhromeyev told the same subcommittee on tuesday 
that future talks on other categories of nuclear and conventional 
weapons could be derailed by continued us resistance to naval 
arms talks 
lehman said that in current arms negotiations the soviets had 
not formally insisted on linking any agreements to future 
discussions about naval nuclear arms 
gorbachev proposed at his last meeting with president bush in 
malta last december that the superpowers undertake to negotiate 
cuts in shortrange naval nuclear arms but the administration has 
resisted 
the united states has about 2200 tactical nuclear weapons at 
sea compared with about 2700 for the soviets according to 
figures supplied by the subcommittee 
lehman said the elimination of tactical naval nuclear arms would 
undermine the united states traditional position as the 
predominant naval force in the world and it could hurt the 
security of us allies who depend on us naval power 
trost while expressing similar doubts suggested that such 
talks might be acceptable 
if we could with proper confidence in their willingness to 
abide by an agreement be sure there were no nuclear weapons that 
threatened either sides ships at sea im sure wed both be more 
comfortable that way he said 
later under questioning trost said he was referring only to 
the tactical category of naval weapons not to seabased cruise or 
ballistic missiles of longer range 
yes it could be in our interests if all the ifs i 
previously stated are included he said and you could label me 
as a lifetime pessimist on the likelihood of ever concluding such 
an agreement he added quickly 
trosts description of an acceptable formula for negotiations to 
eliminate shortrange nuclear arms at sea appeared similar to that 
offered tuesday by akhromeyev who said his government was willing 
to include related weaponry such as that carried on aircraft 
carriers submarines and landbased naval aircraft

president bushs open skies proposal to 
lessen eastwest tensions through aerial surveillance is snagged in 
negotiations and the state department is blaming the soviet union 
for the setback 
in a statement friday that confirmed reports from budapest the 
site of the treaty talks the department said several key issues 
were in dispute 
these include the territory to be overflown by unarmed aircraft 
and the number of such surveillance flights 
today was the tentative deadline for signing the treaty 
at least two other prospective eastwest accords also are in 
trouble 
treaties to curb us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles and 
to set lower troops ceilings in europe have not been completed 
negotiators are unable to settle their differences even under the 
pressure of an approaching ussoviet summit 
secretary of state james a baker iii is flying to moscow on 
sunday night to try to overcome the impasse 
richard boucher a department spokesman said the soviets had 
blocked agreement on most of the open skies issues because they 
favor a less intrusive regime 
last year when bush reworked a proposal first made more than 30 
years ago by president eisenhower open skies was promoted as a 
us contribution to ease eastwest tensions 
bush was signaling his determination to match soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in overcoming cold war suspicions 
last december in brussels the 16 north atlantic treaty 
organization allies approved bushs proposal to let unarmed warsaw 
pact aircraft fly over their territory in search of military 
activity 
then in february nato and warsaw pact countries meeting in 
ottawa canada agreed to set annual quotas for overflights and to 
invite neutral nations to participate details were to be settled 
in time for a treaty signing today 
but the negotiations did not as we had hoped they would 
reach agreement on an open skies treaty boucher said 
despite some progress key issues remain to be decided he 
said 
among them were what sort of sensors would be permitted on the 
overflying aircraft and the territory to be covered 
the soviets wanted to include nonparticipating countries in the 
surveillance plan there also was disagreement over how much 
information would be shared between the two sides 
the delay in concluding an open skies treaty is part of a 
general slowdown on the arms control front 
negotiations in vienna to reduce troops tanks and other 
nonnuclear weapons in europe have stalled over aircraft 
helicopters and a system to verify compliance 
meanwhile the united states and the soviet union are having 
problems in geneva trying to complete a treaty to reduce their 
longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
baker hopes to reach an agreement in principle next week with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze for bush and 
gorbachev to sign during their may 30june 3 washington summit 
most observers rate his chances as poor 
the talks scheduled for wednesday through friday in moscow 
have already been extended to saturday a sign of the workload 
facing baker and shevardnadze 
however ronald lehman director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency told a senate armed services subcommittee 
friday we see no reason why we shouldnt be able to get an 
agreement at the talks 
the nato allies saw an open skies treaty as a way to ensure 
compliance with a troopreduction accord each participating 
country would have to permit at least one surveillance flight every 
three months 
the united states the soviet union canada and the european 
nations would participate

conservation groups say interior secretary 
manuel lujans call for reexamining protection of endangered 
species is outrageous and recalls the reagan administrations 
prodevelopment policies toward the environment 
lujan sparked the criticism friday after he was quoted as saying 
that congress should look at the federal law protecting endangered 
species with an eye toward increasing its flexibility 
lujan cited as one example of how the endangered species act 
causes problems the controversy in arizona over construction of a 
200 million telescope on a mountain inhabited by rare and 
endangered red squirrels 
do we have to save every subspecies lujan suggested in an 
interview thursday with the denver post the red squirrel is the 
best example nobodys told me the difference between a red 
squirrel a black one or a brown one 
he said federal law protecting endangered species was just too 
tough and added weve got to change it 
in interviews with two other colorado newspapers lujan vowed to 
find a way to build the animaslaplata water project in the state 
although its construction has been threatened by the endangered 
squawfish he said one option might be to move the fish elsewhere 
as word of lujans comments circulated friday conservationists 
reacted angrily 
michael francis of the wilderness society said the remarks 
showed mr lujans incredible lack of understanding of biology 
and public policy 
id have to say hes getting pretty close to another jim watt 
mr lujan certainly is trying to better his mark said 
francis referring to the reagan administration interior secretary 
who was widely criticized by environmentalists for his 
prodevelopment views 
jay hair president of the national wildlife federation said he 
was incensed that the very cabinet official whose job it is to be 
the countrys frontline protector of endangered wildlife would 
make such outrageous statements 
hair said the mount graham red squirrel the focus of attention 
in the arizona telescope dispute case is in the 11th hour of 
existence on the planet fewer than 200 of the squirrels are left 
lujans press secretary steve goldstein did not dispute the 
quotes as reported he said his boss had sought only to point out 
some frustrations he has had with enforcing the endangered 
species act 
goldstein said lujan wants congress to reexamine when 
subspecies should be protected under the federal law and what 
protection should be afford when the same species exist in multiple 
locations he said lujan does not believe those issues will weaken 
the law 
conservationists and some members of congress however 
interpreted lujans comments as a clear attempt to weaken the law 
congress will strongly resist any attempt to weaken the 
endangered species act sen john chafee rri said in a 
statement 
while lujan a former republican congressman from new mexico 
has said he is concerned about aspects of the federal law he 
promised to continue to enforce its provisions

pope john paul ii concerned by the 
growth of usbased evangelical protestant churches in mexico 
pleaded with converts to return to the roman catholic faith that 
shaped this countrys modern history 
the church awaits you with open arms to bring you back 
together with christ john paul said friday speaking to a 
joyful flagwaving crowd that topped 200000 he spoke from an 
altar atop a pyramid that resembled a mayan temple 
the pontiff was on the sixth day of an eightday visit to 
mexico today he visits the provincial city of zacatecas before 
returning to mexico city to address a gathering of intellectuals 
the popes homilies here and in tuxtla gutierrez 90 miles to 
the south were directed to mexicos indians and reflected growing 
alarm in the vatican over the success of noncatholic churches in 
latin america particularly in mexico 
protestant evangelical activity has been strongest in the 
southeastern states of tabasco chiapas and oaxaca as well as 
across the border in guatemala protestants have translated the 
bible into indian tongues for the first time and found a receptive 
audience among landless peasants and poor forced to migrate to 
cities 
villahermosa is the capital of tabasco where an estimated 20 
percent of the states 14 million residents are noncatholic 
twice the national average 
i think again about those people who have distanced themselves 
from the catholic church i would like to meet with each one of 
you to say return to the breast of the church your mother the 
pope cried in his homily 
in tuxtla gutierrez the pope urged mexicos downtrodden indians 
to fight to improve their lives 
dont be seduced by vices like alcohol abuse which causes so 
many ravages and dont cooperate with drug trafficking which 
causes destruction to so many people in the world the pope told 
a crowd of more than 150000 in a field below chiapas misty green 
mountains 
the pope encouraged indians not to lose hope in the face of 
poverty or the continuous assalt on your cultural traditions he 
praised the traditional indian emphasis on the paradise of the 
afterlife but you also have the obligation to improve your own 
human situation 
john paul also expressed concern for refugees fleeing political 
persecution and death squads in guatemala which borders chiapas 
and tabasco 
the southeastern trips main aim however was shoring up the 
local catholic church in the face of competition the churches 
growing fastest in mexico include baptists jehovahs witnesses 
pentecostalists assembly of god and mormons 
those who convert are often disenchanted with a political and 
economic system that is destroying native culture and spreading 
poverty and discrimination despite reform laws many have lost 
their communal lands to private farmers 
the pontiff wearing gold and red robes said some people may 
have turned to the evangelical churches because they felt more 
welcome in a small group among familiar people who help each 
other 
others he said may have left the catholic church because of 
material worries an apparent reference to usbased churches 
that distribute aid among the mexican poor although most 
proselytizing is now carried out by mexican converts 
in tuxtla gutierrez john paul addressed the crowd briefly in 
two indian tongues tzotzil and zoque drawing laughter when he 
joked about his pronunciation in villahermosa the pontiff tried 
out chontal and cholco 
over six million of mexicos 85 million citizens do not 
understand spanish speaking only mayan dialects or other indian 
tongues 
before the service in tuxtla gutierrez john paul prayed at the 
cathedral and comforted the families of 28 pilgrims who died 
thursday in a plane crash while flying in to see the pope 
death is not the last word because for those who have faith 
life does not end it transforms itself the pope said he kissed 
a cross on the coffin of luis miguel canton marin the bishop of 
tapachula who had worked closely with indian groups

economic boom has bolstered the picture of a strong industrious 
nation 
yet the south korean governments popularity is at an alltime 
low and its exportfueled economy has sagged inflation is running 
in double digits and the volatile stock market hit a twoyear low 
foreign investors have besieged consultants embassies trade 
offices and government ministries seeking assurances of the 
nations stability 
the latest wave of unrest has been sparked by workers who are 
demanding more rights and more say in management and radical 
students who blame the government for a variety of troubles 
in timehonored korean fashion complaints are registered with 
protests which often turn violent 
though the latest demonstrations have been far smaller than 
those three years ago that forced electoral reforms the government 
is cracking down hard to save itself as well as its international 
image 
on wednesday about 100000 students hurling firebombs and rocks 
fought police in 17 cities the largest antigovernment protests 
since 1987 
two weeks ago tens of thousands of workers walked off their 
jobs in sympathy after riot police charged into the nations 
largest shipyard and the staterun television network to end 
strikes 
so far this year students and workers have not joined together 
but history suggests that an alliance of the two groups can have 
grave results for governments 
in 1987 protests by students and workers combined to force the 
government to accept reforms that eventually led to popular 
elections for the presidency and the victory of roh taewoo 
in putting down this years worker unrest rohs government 
gambled that the labor turmoil would not become a wider political 
issue wages have risen 50 to 60 percent in the last two years and 
labor rights not economics were the workers concern 
most workers returned to their jobs this week but the 
governments heavyhandedness in dealing with the workers angered 
radical students who have been accusing the roh government for 
months of being antireform and dictatorial 
students dissidents and opposition politicians are also upset 
about the merging of the ruling party with two opposition parties 
earlier this year which gave the government overwhelming control 
of the national assembly 
roh said the merger was needed for political and economic 
stability because parliamentary deadlocks had bogged down affairs 
of state 
kim daejung leader of the opposition party for peace and 
democracy said this week it was time for roh to completely 
revamp his thinking about everything in this country 
kim said roh should disband the new party call new elections 
and realize that labor and business problems cannot be solved with 
a naked fist 
rohs problems are reflected in a poll taken by his ruling 
democratic liberal party that indicated 88 percent of the voters 
dont like the way things are going rohs popularity is at 12 
percent his lowest ever the party said 
but roh said this week that things arent so bad 
the real problem is that a pervasive sense of anxiety is 
making the situation more troublesome than it actually is roh 
told a nationwide television audience 
he acknowledged the economy was in trouble but said it was 
recovering he admitted prices were up but said inflation would 
level off 
several cabinet ministers held an unusual nationwide television 
news conference aimed at showing government resolve to deal firmly 
with violent protests 
prosecutors said student leaders and dissidents who incited 
violence would be rounded up 
the nations newspapers for their part suggest that its time 
for both the demonstrators and the government to shape up 
the performance of the roh administration has not been very 
satisfactory said the donga ilbo newspaper to the protesters 
it advised we must achieve solid democratic reforms only through 
legal methods even if this may be rather timeconsuming

senate leaders will meet next week to explore 
chances of reaching a compromise on widely contrasting bills that 
would overhaul the way political campaigns are financed 
competing republican and democratic versions were brought friday 
to the senate floor where members of both parties spent most of 
the day proclaiming that the others version would only heighten 
public cynicism about politics 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine accused republicans of 
trying to open the floodgates to wealthy individuals financing 
federal elections with almost unlimited money 
democrats said the republican bill would raise the amount that 
wealthy individuals can now contribute openly to candidates and 
their parties from 25000 currently to more than 340000 annually 
gop senators countered that democraticproposed spending 
ceilings and partial public financing would preclude challengers 
from raising funds needed to overcome incumbent lawmakers name 
recognition and freeze private business out of politics 
you can bet the house that the american people are not 
interested in the taxpayer financing of politicians said 
republican leader bob dole of kansas 
mitchell expressed a faint hope that a package agreeable to both 
parties and president bush could be drafted by the end of next week 
after he and other senate leaders meet dole suggested it will take 
longer 
no one should expect any miracles dole said its going 
to take a lot of give and take on both sides we are not close to 
anything yet 
the biggest stumbling block will be the proposed ceilings on how 
much candidates can spend while expressing a willingness to 
negotiate competing proposals on virtually every other issue 
democrats insist that any compromise will have to include a 
spending lid 
a diet is no good without a limit on calories likewise 
campaign reform is not real without a limit on cash said sen 
robert c byrd dwva only spending limits will get the money 
chase under control 
the proposed spending ceilings in the democratic bill range from 
18 million in small states such as wyoming and alaska up to 96 
million for the largest state california but democrats are not 
wedded to the specific amounts 
but the notion of any ceiling is abhorrent to at least a 
majority of the senates 45 republicans they rejected a bipartisan 
task forces suggestion for a flexible ceiling with limits on 
outofstate contributions but no lid on how much a candidate could 
raise in small amounts from instate residents 
the recommendations of the task force which was appointed by 
mitchell and dole also were a little too flexible for democrats 
who still want a lid on instate contributions 
the republicans top objectives are to abolish or at least 
greatly limit the role of specialinterest political action 
committees in campaigns and the estimated 45 million in unreported 
expenditures by unions in getoutthevote drives aimed primarily 
at benefiting democrats 
democrats sensing a vulnerability on the pac issue have 
revised their proposal to include a ban on direct pac contributions 
to candidates but they would still allow the national parties to 
raise 35 million a year and their senatorial election committees 
an additional 38 million from pacs 
what we have here in effect is a big moneylaundering 
scheme dole said apparently one that wont be around too 
long 
sen david boren dokla has acknowledged that democrats are 
willing to yield more on the pac issue but in getting their 
colleagues to agree to give up contributions from pacs to their 
individual campaigns party leaders had to revive a partial public 
financing mechanism to make up for the losses 
and senators up for reelection in 1992 who have already 
received pac contributions would get to keep them their 
challengers would be allowed to raise matching amounts from pacs 
but republicans complain that the prospects they could are limited 
since 80 percent of all pac donations go to incumbents

director nils gaup made his first film 
based on a 1000yearold legend he heard from his grandfather in 
the hopes it would be a hit among his native lapp people 
it was then the film called pathfinder was nominated for 
an oscar as best foreign film and won rave reviews in london and 
at numerous film festivals on friday it opened in new york 
the film is in lapp a language spoken by less than 40000 
traditional reindeer herders in the northern fringes of scandianvia 
and the soviet union 
i made it for a lapp audience so when it was successful 
elsewhere it was a big surprise to me said gaup 35 back in 
oslo after a trip to new york to help promote the film 
pathfinder is based on the legend of a lapp boy who saved 
his people from a band of barbarians that had killed his family 
it was filmed on the tundra in northern norway near gaups home 
village of kautokeino in keeping with the legend it was filmed in 
the depths of artic winter with temperatures plummeting to minus 
40 
professional and amateur lapp actors from norway sweden and 
finland took part in the eightweek filming it took at least as 
long to make the reindeerskin clothing and the tents the film 
cost 23 million part of which came from a norwegian government 
grant 
sitting at a sidewalk cafe in oslo gaup said he was not 
concerned about how new york critics would react to the film 
what they say doesnt really mean anything to me because the 
film has already done so much more than i ever hoped for he said 
he said he intends to write and direct other lapp films to help 
preserve his culture 
he recalled his boyhood in arctic norway when lapps swapped 
tales and used reindeer for transportation 
the intrusion of television and other modern conveniences has 
begun to change that now snowmobiles are as common as sleds and 
people have stopped sitting around telling legends he said 
thats why it is so important to tell these stories the lapp 
culture is one of the last left with direct ties to ancient ways of 
thinking

the rumor mill has new york and cleveland as 
the finalists for the 1992 democratic national convention but 
party officials insist nothing is set 
people are hypothetically guessing thats what browns going 
to do party spokesman michael mccurry said friday of democratic 
chairman ronald h brown but its not true 
cleveland new orleans new york and houston are still in the 
running for the convention the partys site selection committee is 
scheduled to meet may 30 to narrow the field to two and brown will 
make the final choice in midjune 
of the four houston is considered the longest shot 
but party sources are quick to point out that no city is perfect 
for the convention expected to attract 35000 people and worldwide 
television coverage from july 1316 1992 
the partys last convention was in atlanta although the hall 
was too small and democrats had other complaints atlanta is 
estimated to have reaped nearly 70 million in economic benefits 
here is how the four finalists stack up according to the party 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
some members of the site selection committee called clevelands 
presentation in march the best ever made by any city in any year 
but the high praise didnt move hotel rooms any closer to the 
prospective site the ix center in suburban brook park ohio the 
citys own estimate is that more than 5000 of the needed rooms 
would be at least an hour away 
james ruvolo chairman of the ohio democratic party said 
its a decision by ron brown between message and comfort 
ruvolo defined the message as middle america 
its the areas we need to be carrying no presidents ever won 
the white house without carrying ohio its cleveland a town 
thats made a comeback on its own 
new orleans was host to the 1988 republican convention the food 
was great and the hotels were close to the downtown superdome 
which offered ample room for a convention 
but new orleans is having trouble coming up with the 15 million 
in upfront money required by the democrats in addition louisiana 
is regarded as a stronghold of the antiabortion movement which 
puts it out of step with the mood of most democrats 
money is no problem for new york which has offered 22 million 
the most of any city and the city has hotels galore but madison 
square garden would again confront the democrats with a hall 
smaller than they would like 
the last contender on the list houston is unwilling to give 
the democrats access to the astrodome for the long period the party 
says it would need to set up for the convention the stadium is 
home to the citys baseball team the houston astros 
as an alternative the city has offered the george r brown 
center which the party considers too small

czechoslovakias alexander dubcek hero of the 
prague spring reform movement crushed by red army tanks a 
generation ago is voicing strong support for change in the soviet 
union 
it is our greatest hope that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will stay in power and succeed in his reforms sen 
alan cranston dcalif quoted dubcek as saying during a gathering 
in the us capitol on friday 
dubcek on his first visit to the united states echoed the 
message voiced here three months ago by czechoslovak president 
vaclav havel havel said in a speech to congress that the more 
quickly and peacefully the soviet union moves toward genuine 
political and economic reform the better it will be for the 
whole world 
dubcek began his first day in washington meeting with secretary 
of state james a baker iii for nearly an hour 
the state department said baker and dubcek agreed that regional 
initiatives such as havels meeting a month ago with leaders of 
austria italy hungary poland and yugoslavia were a useful part 
of the integration process for europe 
while supporting western proposals on german unification 
postcommunist czechoslovakia has been promoting gradual 
replacement of the warsaw pact and nato alliances with an 
alleuropean security organization and seeking to reestablish 
itself as a crossroads of europe 
havels meeting in bratislava was unique in having 
representation from both alliances and nonaligned countries 
cranston said that asked how america could most help 
czechoslovakia dubcek replied that it should grant trade 
concessions czechoslovakia recently concluded a trade agreement 
with the united states and is expected to gain coveted 
mostfavorednation treatment in early summer after passage of 
legislation 
cranston said he couldnt ascertain if dubcek who headed the 
czechoslovak communist party at the time of the 1968 soviet 
invasion of czechoslovakia was still a communist but hes 
certainly a reformed communist 
we made an attempt 21 years ago to break the stalinist 
system dubcek recalled in a brief talk ttealing confiscated drugs

a bill allowing more leeway in job 
discrimination complaints sends a signal that the nation wants 
more protection than allowed by us supreme court decisions last 
year the bills author said 
the bill that became law in minnesota earlier this month takes 
aim at three high court decisions last june the decisions placed 
the burden of proof on employees and interpreted a racial 
discrimination law as applying to discrimination in hiring not 
discrimination on the job 
the sponsor of the bill democratic rep howard orenstein said 
he hoped congress would approve legislation similar to his 
it sends a signal to washington that the states will not stand 
by while federal civil rights protections are cut back orenstein 
said 
the high courts three rulings have been deplored by civil 
rights advocates who say they make it tougher for discrimination 
lawsuits to be pressed under federal law 
the three rulings were among five decisions issued by the court 
last summer all three were handed down by a 5to4 margin 
the minnesota measure would allow discrimination suits in hiring 
decisions as well as any time after the person was hired 
subcontractors could make similar discrimination claims against a 
contractor 
the law requires employers to prove that a job requirement that 
has the effect of screening out minority members or women is 
justified as a business necessity 
a provision also would give plaintiffs more time to file a suit 
alleging that an employers seniority system was discriminatory 
congress is considering legislation proposed by democratic sen 
edward m kennedy of massachusetts on tuesday the bill passed the 
house education and labor committee on a 2310 vote president bush 
has said he would veto the measure which is opposed by business 
interests 
julius chambers directorcounsel of the naacp legal defense and 
educational fund told the new york times that minnesota is the 
first state to confront the supreme court decisions so broadly he 
said massachusetts has passed a much narrower bill 
the minnesota action closes a big gap chambers told the 
newspaper it has important lessons for people in washington and 
other states

as children sent roses and phoned home 
this mothers day weekend iris phillips nervously waited in prison 
for her 10yearold son to show up with his violin 
she had never heard him play a year ago he disliked music 
im missing a lot said mrs phillips whos serving a 
14year manslaughter sentence for killing her husband with a 
shotgun 
its not just the big things its the daytoday things hes 
got a new girlfriend and i dont know her hes got new pets hes 
growing up and im missing him she said friday 
sociologists who study crime say a mother going to prison is 
much harder on families than a father going to prison often 
children end up living with relatives or foster families often 
siblings are separated 
the problems can be compounded by prison systems designed to 
better meet the needs of men who make up the vast majority of the 
inmate population about 5 percent of the 645000 people who were 
in prison nationwide by mid1989 were women and 70 percent to 80 
percent of them were mothers of dependent children 
a researcher at the university of southern maine is looking for 
ways to help all parents behind bars become better mothers and 
fathers 
karen tilbor a research associate at the universitys human 
services development institute said the program at the maine 
correctional center where mrs phillips is housed in nearby 
windham is similar to a handful of prison parenting programs 
around the united states 
the maine program includes eightweek training sessions for 
parents and monthly meetings where children can visit in a room 
designed to look something like a daycare center children can 
play games and make artwork or crafts 
one saturday a month a child will come in and do something 
special with their parent not something in the regular visitation 
room which is stark tilbor said 
the program is financed mostly with a threeyear federal grant 
it gives them some quality time together said the prison 
superintendent james r clemons 
mrs phillips recently joined the voluntary program her son 
scott visits about three times a month and she hopes to develop 
better interpersonal skills to make the visits more rewarding for 
both of them 
it teaches you new ways of parenting mrs phillips said 
it tries to help you communicate with your children one segment 
is how to listen you talk for three minutes then you listen to 
another person talk for three minutes 
the mother was anxious as she waited for her boy to visit today 
their first visit alone 
are we going to be able to find enough to do she wondered 
is he going to be bored i dont want him to sit here twiddling 
his thumbs and wishing he wasnt here im nervous i want him to 
want to come back for the next visit 
seeing her sons life progress in bits and pieces shows mrs 
phillips how much she is missing but most difficult about being 
separated from her child is trying to help him with his troubles 
without being fully informed mrs phillips said 
your child has a problem and you dont have the whole story 
she said my sons not the kind of person wholl say ma i 
dont like the teacher because of this and this 
creasie finney hairston professor of social work at indiana 
university at indianapolis said little has been done in the past 
to help prison mothers but the nation now has about a dozen 
programs similar to the one in maine 
i think it is a very positive approach she said the 
limited data thats available shows they have a positive impact on 
the child and on the mother

the armed services are proposing to cut two 
aircraft carriers and three new ballistic missile submarines and to 
defer plans for mobile landbased intercontinental missiles 
according to published reports 
the proposals were contained in classified memoranda submitted 
to defense secretary dick cheney in response to his instructions to 
identify further cuts in the 1990s that will be submitted to a 
major review this summer according to stories in todays editions 
of the new york times and the washington post 
the program memoranda cover the 1992 through 1997 fiscal 
years and often incorporate known decisions such as cheneys plan 
for only 75 b2 stealth bombers instead of the original 132 
another is the armys determination that by 1997 it should have 
580000 troops down from the current 781000 
even though the navys memo calls for 12 deployed carriers the 
service still wants 14 according to the post 
navy secretary lawrence garrett iii was quoted as writing cheney 
that the forces best suited to perform reliably our enduring 
missions in the coming decade is centered on 14 aircraft 
carrier battle groups 
the navy calls for 488 warships the first time it has settled 
on a number according to both newspapers there are 549 today 
among other reported plans was one to commission only 18 
submarines to carry the trident missile instead of 21 
the air force calls for phasing out multiplewarhead missiles a 
decision fitting the arms control strategy advocated by many on 
capitol hill 
deployment of the mobile missile programs can be deferred with 
acceptable risk said the air force secretary donald b rices 
memo quoted in the post 
the times said the service proposed to develop the midgetman 
missile long conceived of as based on special trucks for silos 
the post said some minuteman missiles would be reduced from three 
warheads to one 
the air force was said to propose 28 ground attack wings 
compared with 36 now and 30 previously planned

taiwan may deny docking rights to the 
goddess of democracy thwarting plans for the ship to beam 
prodemocracy broadcasts to china organizers say 
officials at the northern port of keelung on friday granted the 
ship docking rights to take on provisions before heading for 
international waters where it will is to begin broadcasts the 
vessel is expected to arrive sunday 
but communications minister chang chienpang said that the ship 
would not be allowed back if it makes unauthorized broadcasts 
china has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the 
planned broadcasts and has warned that any help taiwan gives the 
ship would be considered an open provocation 
taiwans military reported friday that it had sighted a 
submarine near the radio ship wednesday and restated earlier 
pledges to protect the vessel if it is attacked near taiwan 
the official military news agency said the submarine suspected 
of belonging to the communist chinese disappeared when a 
nationalist fighter tried to spot it 
the ship is sponsored by a coalition of press organizations 
headed by the french news magazine actuel with funds from several 
overseas chinese communities 
it is named after the statue erected in beijings tiananmen 
square last year during prodemocracy protests the protests were 
crushed in june by the military and hundreds and possibly 
thousands of people were killed 
pascal dupont a reporter with actuel said changs announcement 
came as a big surprise and could force organizers to drop the 
project 
we came with a peaceful purpose dupont said we are legal 
and moral 
he said organizers do not agree with the taiwan governments 
position but we respect it we will try to convince the government 
of our peaceful purpose and make it soften the position 
dupont said the ship would have to take on provisions after a 
planned threeweek broadcast mission in international waters there 
do not appear to be any other viable ports in the region because 
the nearby british colony of hong kong already has refused to allow 
the vessel to dock 
although the nationalist chinese government of taiwan is the 
sworn enemy of the communists in beijing relations have warmed in 
recent months with increased business and civilian ties 
taiwanese fishermen planned to organize a flotilla of about 20 
fishing boats to escort the democracy ship although authorities 
warned them that their boats should not be used for purposes other 
than fishing 
the nationalists once governed china but retreated across the 
taiwan straits to this island in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
communist forces

an associate us attorney from new york will 
oversee the investigation of package bombs that killed a federal 
judge in alabama and a city official in georgia the justice 
department says 
louis freeh a former fbi agent is being put in charge of the 
investigation the department said in a statement friday 
judge robert vance of the 11th us circuit court of appeals was 
killed dec 16 in his home in suburban birmingham ala when a 
package delivered to his house blew up when he opened it 
two days later a similar device killed robert robinson a civil 
rights lawyer and a savannah ga city councilman 
package bombs also were found at the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta and the naacp office in jacksonville fla 
authorities have said those bombs were defused 
the fbi and other federal agencies investigating the killings 
have considered offering a 500000 reward for information leading

federal health officials are recommending that 
physicians use a recently approved drug as standard treatment for 
recurrences of a lifethreatening infection in aids patients 
the drug fluconazole has proven so successful that a 
governmentsponsored comparative study has been stopped and the 
drug offered to all participants officials at the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases said friday 
in the study fluconazole was compared with amphotericin b 
which has been the standard treatment for the infection as well as 
for recurrences 
the infection cryptococcal meningitis affects the brain and 
nervous system about 10 percent of aids victims get the disease 
and after treatment for the initial infection they need lifetime 
maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence 
the study was stopped april 30 and preliminary results were 
distributed to physicians who treat patients with aids officials 
said 
patients in the study had been treated successfully with 
amphotericin b when they first got the infection of the 106 
patients who received fluconazole to prevent recurrence two had 
relapses of the 77 who received amphotericin b 13 got the 
infection again niaid said 
fluconazole made by pfizer inc has fewer side effects than 
amphotericin b also fluconazole can be given by mouth while 
amphotericin b must be given intravenously 
amphotericin b causes nausea fever and can impair kidney and 
bone marrow function fluconazole has few side effects but in some 
patients it can cause abdominal discomfort nausea skin rash and 
sometimes liver damage

wally etseksons half acre of waterview 
property looks pretty good on paper but hell need scuba gear to 
get a real feel for the place 
etsekson an investor from the seattle suburb of bellevue was 
the lone bidder for the surplus piece of state property he bought 
the parcel sight unseen and says he was quite surprised to 
learn it is almost completely submerged in the columbia river 
it looked like a good location on a map etsekson said 
the parcel for which the state sought a minimum of 31500 was 
one of seven surplus properties it offered wednesday etsekson paid 
33150 
im surprised somebody bought it said roy heikkala 
director of property and development for the port of vancouver 
after looking at the land officials had concluded the state 
would probably be stuck with it he said 
the vancouver property is mostly level and covered with 
grass gravel and asphalt the sale announcement noted 
but a map showing its location near the interstate 5 bridge and 
a motel offered one clue to the parcels fatal flaw one boundary 
is labeled outer harbor limit 
why doesnt the announcement note that the parcel is mostly 
submerged 
im not sure said paul lovgren a department of 
transportation property manager in the states capital olympia 
evidently it was obvious from walking out there and looking at 
it as a rule of thumb you dont buy a piece of property without 
looking at it

where does an 800pound sea lion go when he 
visits san francisco 
anywhere he wants 
months after invading dozens of expensive berths at posh pier 39 
marina the huge barking sea lions with bad breath continue to 
swagger around their selfdeclared spa on san francisco bay 
oh theyre having a wonderful time posing for the cameras 
said marina spokeswoman alicia vargas its the longest bachelor 
party weve ever had here its costing us up to 5000 a month in 
dock space 
since january sea lions have lived on runs of herring and 
anchovy at the marina they are now thought to be feasting on squid 
and various fish 
vargas said management is searching for a way for the animals 
and marina humans to coexist with each other i wish we could 
negotiate 
one thing the marina may not do is try to actively chase the 
animals away they are protected under federal law and may not be 
harassed hunted captured or killed 
i dont think you can even glare at them said sheila 
chandor a manager of the restaurantshopsamusement complex on the 
edge of the bay 
friday morning there were 50 to 60 of the aggressive creatures 
on the docks quarreling wrestling and jumping up and down 
the invasion has produced a touch of drama around a large bull 
that has been named flea collar the animal when younger and 
smaller dived for fish one day and came up with some kind of ring 
of plastic or some other material around his neck apparently from 
some discarded trash 
a group of animal lovers noticed that as the sea lion grew the 
neckpiece tightened and was cutting into the animals blubber 
three people tried to approach flea collar from three 
different directions to cut the ring away but they couldnt do 
it said vargas he went into the water 
she expects that flea collar will be strangled on the piece of 
trash one of these days 
in february at the height of the assault about 400 pushy 
argumentative sea lions some as hefty as 800 pounds swamped the 
docks around 20 slips in the west marina and scared boaters away 
they growled at boats going by and forced the marina to move boats 
to other slips 
the crowd of critters put the docks including electrical 
connections under water the sea lions have charged and snapped at 
people and seem to take a dim view of boats that pass too close to 
their enclave 
with the exception of a few female juveniles the animals still 
at the marina are all males said james lecky chief of the 
protective species environment branch of the national marine 
fisheries service 
the breedingage males over five years of age will probably 
leave soon for the usual sea lion mating areas in the channel 
islands off santa barbara he said but some of the juveniles might 
hang around all summer 
they come and go said vargas who would not estimate damage 
from the animals since workers cant get close enough for an 
examination of dock operations 
sea lions also are getting the last laugh in seattle 
several of the creatures were trucked to the channel islands to 
stop their feast on a run of wild steelhead trout at locks in the 
city but four of them have been spotted recently near seattle 
after a 1000mile swim back that took them about a month state 
wildlife officials say

a homeless woman seized her 12yearold daughter 
from a hospital where she was being treated for heart disease 
because the woman believes blood transfusions would damage the 
childs soul authorities said 
state officials issued public pleas friday to caroline winfield 
35 asking her to return her daughter kimberly so the child can 
receive the medical attention she needs 
the mother who lost custody of her three children last month 
because she was homeless opposes heart surgery because she is a 
jehovahs witness and feels a blood transfusion would endanger her 
daughters soul said dave schneidman a spokesman for the illinois 
department of children and family services 
he said the child needed openheart surgery to survive the 
prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live 
without the surgery he said 
the woman contacted her family about returning the child who 
left childrens memorial hospital about 1 am thursday but was 
afraid to do so her estranged husband larry said friday 
she wanted to return the child but she wanted to do it without 
getting in trouble schneidman said were not real interested 
in catching the mother if she doesnt want to be caught but we do 
want the child back so we can save the childs life 
the estranged husband said she contacted him by telephone and 
had visited his mother mary winfield a short time after the 
alleged abduction in an unsuccessful attempt to get her two younger 
sons who are in the motherinlaws custody 
police obtained an arrest warrant for caroline winfield on a 
charge of child abduction because kimberly is a ward of the state 
said chicago police lt edmund beazley 
a hospital spokeswoman said kimberly who was admitted may 9 
was not critically ill 
she was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her 
heart problem said spokeswoman jean benzies her doctor does 
not believe her life is in immediate danger 
however it is clinically advisable that she be located and 
treated within a month 
kimberly was diagnosed as having an enlarged heart and possible 
heart valve damage after a case of rheumatic fever and had been 
taking heart medication family members said 
they said they did not know if the girl had been receiving the 
medication after the family returned to chicago from little rock 
ark earlier this year 
jehovahs witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against 
the teachings of the bible citing the section of leviticus that 
reads whatsoever man eats any manner of blood i will cut 
him off from among his people 
you cant do surgery without a transfusion of blood 
schneidman said 
the family services department waited about 34 hours after the 
disappearance to notify the press so the police could check leads 
on mrs winfields whereabouts schneidman said 
those leads had been exhausted he said 
the state was named temporary custodian of kimberly and the two 
brothers ages 2 and 8 because mrs winfield was unable to care 
for them schneidman said 
they were living on the streets without proper housing or any 
evident means of support schneidman said 
the boys names were not released

the government threatened to fire 
about 60000 public employees who held sitin strikes to demand 
that their wages be doubled and that a law protecting labor rights 
be restored 
also friday president violeta barrios de chamorro ordered a 
sweeping review of property seizures during 10 years of sandinista 
rule 
about 2000 public workers shouting power to the people 
broke through a cordon of 100 policemen late friday and took over a 
plaza outside the presidential offices 
workers on strike should retun to their jobs said labor 
minister francisco rosales otherwise we will declare the strike 
illegal and apply the labor law and those who do not show up will 
be fired 
government officials refused to meet with union representatives 
the workers then asked for a meeting monday and vowed to continue 
the strike 
rosales speaking at a news conference with mrs chamorro said 
the government would negotiate wage increases but not under 
pressure 
government employees rejected a 60 percent pay increase mrs 
chamorro had ordered earlier this week saying it did not keep up 
with the steep price increases 
in the latest round of price hikes the government this week 
doubled water rates tripled electricity rates and raised the rates 
of telephone services by 1300 percent the public transportation 
subsidy was removed 
the cordoba nicaraguas currency was devalued for the fourth 
time in less than a month the devaluations make imports more 
expensive and encourage exports by making them cheaper the moves 
have sent consumer prices soaring 
prices of clothes have shot up barbarously said clarissa 
gutierrez 50 a janitor at the education ministry 
mrs gutierrez complained that a pound of sugar now costs 50 
cents rice 40 cents beans 55 cents and a quart of cooking oil 3 
but roberto martinez 40 who has a stall at managuas sprawling 
eastern market hoped for better times things will change the 
new government is just getting started we suffered more under the 
sandinistas 
the civil service law suspended thursday by mrs chamorro 
protects employees from firing and grants them the right to strike 
and bargain collectively rosales has said it ties the hands of 
the new government 
the union called the general confederation of public 
admnistration workers maintains that the president does not have 
the authority to change laws while the national assembly is in 
session 
the strike is the only instrument the workers have to preserve 
their rights said jose angel bermudez secretary general of the 
federation 
mrs chamorro told the news conference friday we have 
inherited a country that was virtually sacked and in complete 
bankruptcy and it is our responsibility to get it going again 
she announced her government would review all laws passed by the 
leftist sandinistas in their last two months in office mrs 
chamorro took power on april 25 
at the time the sandinistas had control of the national 
assembly but mrs chamorros 14party united national opposition 
took a majority in the parliament with its victory in the feb 25 
elections 
mrs chamorro said all property seizures implemented by the 
sandinistas during their 10 years in power will be reviewed during 
their rule the sandinistas confiscated some private businesses and 
turned them into state enterprises 
the preisdent said spring planting would start this month and 
she ordered that all agricultural and pasture land be opened 
provisionally to rental to revive farm production 
gustavo tabaldo director of the agrarian reform institute said 
that was a temporary measure to allow land to be worked while 
property rights are clarified 
food production dropped so sharply under the sandinistas and 
during the usimposed economic embargo that nicaragua was 
forced to import crops it used to export and shortages occurred of 
such staples as rice and beans the bush administration lifted the 
embargo on the day mrs chamorro was inaugurated 
another law being reviewed allowed senior sandinistas to 
confiscate homes of the wealthy

they were americas space pioneers 
the mercury seven who rode rockets into the final frontier three 
decades later they hope pieces of their past will encourage a 
bright future for the space program 
evidence of the mercury sevens exploits fills the united states 
astronaut hall of fame dedicated friday by five of the surviving 
six mercury astronauts 
the hall of fame represents what we can do collectively to 
encourage youngsters to be involved in space and engineering 
said houston businessman alan shepard 66 who was the first 
american in space 
after all many of them are going to be astronauts in the 
future he said 
none of the mercury astronauts need an exhibit or memorial said 
ohio us sen john glenn 68 who made americas first manned 
orbital mission 
but if this can help inspire someone to better education and 
to inspire some of our young people to do some research then 
this will all be worthwhile he said 
the hall of fame 13 miles from where the mercury seven rocketed 
into history three decades ago honors those first brave flyers 
who journeyed into space the ones who have since followed and 
those who will follow in the future 
a large blue sign with those words was unveiled at the 
dedication ceremony the hall of fame actually opened in march 
included in displays is an umbilical plug from the freedom 7 
spacecraft that carried shepard on a 15minute suborbital flight in 
1961 making him the first american in space there is a chunk of 
the atlas rocket that propelled glenn into space in 1962 americas 
first manned orbital mission 
there is walter schirras mercury spacecraft the late virgil 
gus grissoms spacesuit l gordon coopers spacecraft heat 
shield malcolm scott carpenters camera with which he photographed 
earth and donald deke slaytons food tubes from the 1975 
apollosoyuz mission 
there are more personal items too salvaged from attics and 
garages medals patches flight helmets goggles gloves jackets 
by and large the spaceman image has been a good one for 
youngsters and this will help it remain a good image said 
carpenter 65 who is an aerospace and oceanography consultant in 
palmer lake colo 
all of the surviving seven but schirra were on hand for the 
ceremony grissom died in 1967 aboard apollo in a launchpad fire 
his widow betty attended in his place 
the hall of fame shares the glass and gray metal structure just 
outside kennedy space center with us space camp florida a space 
education program for fourth through seventhgraders it is a 
joint venture between the mercury seven foundation and us space 
camp foundation nonprofit organizations that raise scholarship 
money 
in addition to showcasing the mercury seven the hall of fame 
lists the crew members of 64 us manned space flights the last 
two flights have yet to be posted the more noteworthy astronauts 
eventually will be enshrined in the hall of fame alongside the 
mercury seven the subject of a book by tom wolfe called the 
right stuff

fidel castro met with manuel noriegas defense 
lawyers in march and castro said the information he provided will 
clear the ousted panamanian leader of drug charges 
castro discussed certain sensitive issues with the lawyers 
and provided them with documentation noriega attorney frank rubino 
said friday he gave no details on where the meeting was held 
a brazilian television reporter quoted castro as saying i 
have all the proof which proves the falsehoods of the accusations 
the cuban leader did not say what kind of evidence he gave the 
lawyers but claimed to have all the cards in my hands to 
irrefutably prove the lies 
according to a february 1988 indictment the cuban leader 
mediated a dispute in 1984 between noriega and colombias medellin 
drug cartel over a raid on a drug lab the panamanian leader had 
supposedly been paid to protect 
meanwhile assistant us attorney michael sullivan submitted a 
list friday of noriegas 27 frozen bank accounts around the world 
but immediately asked the judge to seal it from both the defense 
and the public 
defense attorneys have filed a motion to withdraw from the case 
saying they cant continue without some of the frozen 20 million 
to pay fees and expenses 
sullivan said many of noriegas assets including 58 million 
in cash confiscated in his quarters during the december us 
invasion along with his home cars and other personal items have 
simply been handed over to panamas new government 
us district judge william hoeveler said he was disturbed that 
no hearing had been held before the government surrendered the 
money 
although its not common to have 5 million or 6 million in 
ones bedroom it appears the money was his the judge said 
that raises an interesting question about what right the 
government had to give it away 
the defense has subpoenaed records of the cia the drug 
enforcement administration and other agencies seeking to show 
noriega received about 11 million in payoffs from the united 
states government as well as up to 7 million more from foreign 
governments 
the defense claims that money should not be frozen 
hoeveler questioned the defense contention that noriega had no 
information of his own about where his assets were the judge said 
he wanted the general to tell him by the next hearing whether he 
has additional accounts 
defense attorney jon may said noriega had not told them about 
any additional money and added that his clients had no records 
with him in jail 
we are not talking about accounts as you or i might have 
may said these were handled by intermediaries and certain 
people who handled a lot of these matters are under indictment 
that comment apparently referred to officials of the bank of credit 
commerce international who are now on trial for money laundering 
in tampa 
noriega was indicted on february 1988 on charges of taking money 
from colombias medellin drug cartel to make panama a save haven 
for cocaine smuggling he is being held at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center outside of miami

religious leaders vowed at a memorial 
service to seek justice for the 11 people killed in the move 
firebombing five years ago but the federal deadline to file 
charges expires tonight 
the justice department said it expected no civil rights charges 
against police or the city before the statute of limitations runs 
out in the firebombing at the headquarters of the radical group 
two dozen people attended a memorial service friday night for 
five children and six adult move members killed when philadelphia 
police bombed the groups rowhouse destroying 61 other homes and 
leaving 270 people homeless in the process by letting the fire rage 
we cannot rest at peace simply because it was not our houses 
that burned that it was not our children who were killed rev 
robert longenecker said at the service we must rise up and see 
that justice is done 
longenecker and other religious leaders vowed to continue 
seeking charges but justice department officials said friday they 
had no plans to push for civil rights violations against the city 
or police 
the statute of limitations on federal civil rights charges runs 
for five years sunday is the fifth anniversary of the fiery 
confrontation which means charges would have to be brought before 
midnight tonight 
we have been saying all week that we didnt expect anything to 
be done david runkel of the justice department said you never 
say never but it looks extremely unlikely 
on may 13 1985 police dropped a firebomb on the move rowhouse 
in an otherwise quiet philadelphia neighborhood to dislodge a 
bunker atop the building after hours of gunfire they aimed to 
evict the group for harassing neighbors with foulmouthed 
revolutionary rhetoric blared through a bullhorn at all hours 
the bomb started a fire that swept through the block 
while many people disagreed with the politics of move no one 
condoned the firebombing the rev paul m washington said at the 
memorial service held in a west philadelphia church 
those poor children all those people who lost their homes 
and their belongings that shouldnt have happened to them he 
said 
the citys decision to let the fire rage shocked several members 
of a special commission mayor w wilson goode appointed to 
investigate the case 
the justice department after an 18month investigation 
declined to present the case to a federal grand jury 
washington who was a member of the mayors commission met with 
justice department officials earlier this week 
we raised questions of the amount of firepower used the types 
of military weapons used the shrapnel in the bodies the letting 
the building burn we thought that was the best evidence of 
evil intent he said friday 
but all they said was that they deplore what happened but they 
cant prove evil intent 
another commission member clarence bullock said of the justice 
department they said there was no evidence lives were lost 
that should be enough evidence that something bad happened 
ramona africa the only adult to survive the blaze remains in 
prison where she refuses to renounce the group even though doing 
so would mean freedom

seven months into its sixyear 135 
billion journey to jupiter the galileo spacecraft ignited its 
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near earth in december 
nasa said 
the tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a twoday 
maneuver that ends late today said jim wilson a spokesman at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
we are changing both the speed and the aim point for our earth 
flyby its a very gradual change mission director neal ausman 
said friday 
on dec 8 galileo will swoop past earth in a gravity slingshot 
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecrafts orbit around the 
sun and hurl it toward its 1995 rendezvous with jupiter the solar 
systems largest planet 
the spacecraft will study earth during the flyby and again 
during another slingshot maneuver in december 1992 galileo used 
venus as a gravity slingshot feb 9 
when the maneuver started at 1110 am pdt friday galileo was 
96 million miles from earth but had traveled a looping path of 365 
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle atlantis 
last oct 18 wilson said 
its trip to jupiter the fifth planet from the sun will total 
24 billion miles 
the 135 billion mission will take galileo past one asteroid in 
1991 and perhaps another in 1993 in july 1995 the spacecraft 
separates into a 4890pound orbiter and a 760pound probe they 
are scheduled to reach jupiter on dec 7 1995 
the probe will plunge into the planets atmosphere relaying 
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense 
atmospheric pressure the orbiter will spend at least two years 
studying and taking snapshots of jupiter and its major moons io 
europa ganymede and callisto 
one or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get galileo 
to swoop about 1000 miles from earth in december ausman said 
without the maneuvers the spacecraft would miss earth by 15 
million miles

the presidents of the three baltic 
republics met today in the estonian capital to forge a united front 
against moscow in their drive to reestablish independence 
president arnold ruutel of estonia invited leaders of the two 
neighboring baltic states vytautas landsbergis of lithuania and 
anatoly gorbunov of latvia to a pinkandwhite 18th century 
palace for talks expected to revive a 50yearold cooperation 
agreement 
we must give a hand to one another these little nations of 
estonia lithuania and latvia because in history during a 
difficult period we always helped one another ruutel told 
reporters before the meeting thats the way it is today 
in brief opening remarks to reporters delivered in their native 
languages the three presidents spoke of their common fate 
they smiled for a horde of photographers before the closed meeting 
at the toompea palace overlooking tallinns old town 
ruutel said he and his counterparts would sign four documents 
one on political cooperation a letter to soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev a letter to president bush and a joint statement 
gorbachev is scheduled to meet bush in washington at the end of 
may the baltic republics drive for independence is expected to be 
a topic at that summit as well at a meeting between us secretary 
of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in moscow next week 
the agreement will revive the council of baltic states the 
presidents and senior ministers of the three republics the council 
will make nonbinding recommendations on the governments estonian 
officials said 
baltic state representatives set up the council in september 
1934 in geneva under an agreement of unity and cooperation a 
1971 soviet history book called the alliance a hotbed of 
antisoviet agitation 
the baltic republics were part of the russian empire but gained 
their independence amid the turmoil of world war i and the 
bolshevik revolution they were absorbed into the soviet union by 
josef stalin in 1940 
lithuania declared outright on march 11 that it was 
reestablishing independence and latvia and estonia followed with 
declarations that they would resume independence after unspecified 
transition periods 
gorbachev has opposed those moves and demanded that the 
republics observe soviet law a new law requires a referendum and a 
waiting period of up to five years before secession 
the kremlin has slapped a tough economic embargo on lithuania 
and signs of trouble continue to mount for the three republics 
landsbergis was quoted today by vilnius radio as saying up to 
300000 people soon will be unemployed if moscow continues its 
economic blockade against lithuania a republic of 38 million 
also today the information bureau of the lithuanian supreme 
council legislature reported that a column of more than 100 soviet 
military vehicles rumbled through vilnius the capital in the 
early morning hours 
it quoted witnesses as saying the convoy included 59 armored 
personnel carriers 
the move was reminiscent of military maneuvers conducted in the 
weeks just after lithuanias declaration of independence in an 
apparent effort to unnerve residents 
the kremlin was reported friday to have taken its first steps 
against latvia and estonia stopping transfers of hard currency to 
those two republics as well as lithuania 
soviet authorities stopped supplying the baltic republics with 
hard currency april 28 but confirmed it only friday the newspaper 
sovietskaya estonia said 
that means baltic residents will not be able to exchange rubles 
for foreign currencies to be used on trips abroad many estonians 
have been traveling to finland and sweden 
panic buying in latvia forced authorities to begin rationing 
flour pasta salt matches and cereal as of june 1 said the 
baltia news agency a joint news operation of the three republics 
estonian sources said agreements among the three presidents also 
would likely include joint efforts to control the draft of baltic 
residents into the soviet armed forces 
the agreement calls for the baltic states to be included in 
conference on security and cooperation in europe that produced the 
helsinki accords in 1975 said raul malk a spokesmand for 
estonias parliament the baltic leaders want to be invited to a 
followup helsinki meeting proposed for paris this year 
estonias prime minister edgar savisaar met friday with soviet 
defense minister dmitri yazov to discuss the spring military draft 
yazov reportedly rejected a new estonian law that allows youths to 
perform alternative service in their home republic 
savisaar also met with populist soviet politician boris yeltsin 
about possible political and economic cooperation between estonia 
and the russian republic

killing animals he neglects his cast crew and production while he 
searches the bush for an elephant to kill 
this is not a picture about the making of a movie eastwood

africa in the movie viertel called verrill is the writer who 
hates killing wild animals

away from him said viertel he felt he had to prove 
something 
the film shows huston not only as an egomaniac but also as a 
champion of minorities he fights with his glamorous girlfriend who 
makes slurs against jews and with a hotel owner in africa who 
insults his black employees

a plan by finnish health officials to 
give school children chewing gum that prevents tooth decay is 
causing a sticky dilemma 
wheres all that gum going to end up imagine 500 kids coming 
out of the school cafeteria chewing gum said pirkko luoto of the 
helsinki school board 
luoto in charge of planning 42000 school meals in helsinki 
said friday that giving kids chewing gum with meals is technically 
feasible but he added that the results would most likely end up 
under the desks and all over the place 
finnish swedish and norwegian dentists associations have 
recommended that people chew xylitol gum after meals test indicate 
that gum containing xylitol a natural sweetener prevents tooth 
decay 
our research showed that regular use of xylitol reduced 
cavities by as much as 90 percent said arje scheinin of the 
turku university institute of dentistry 
xylitol is found in the tissues of such plants as maple and 
birch trees corn cobs and straw it has been used commercially as 
a sweetener since 1975 
mirja savola in charge of school nutrition in turku displayed 
little enthusiasm for the proposal i have read and heard a lot 
about this research but its far too early to say if we would 
include it on school menus she said 
sales of chewing gum here have almost doubled in the past five 
years as xylitols popularity has grown finns now chew more 
sugarless gum than anyone else in the world its producers say

the us coast guard overseer of exxon 
corps oil spill cleanup has formally approved the companys last 
and final work plan including use of chemical fertilizers 
rear adm david ciancaglini approved the plan friday specifying 
that exxon notify landowners and federal and state agencies two 
weeks before using the fertilizers 
exxon also must develop a program to protect cultural 
resources such as archaeological artifacts in areas affected by 
the march 1989 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil 
ciancaglini said 
i must take into account a host of considerations including 
eagle nesting sensitivities spawning of a variety of species of 
fish wildlife considerations land manager rules and restrictions 
weather and much more ciancaglini said in a statement 
i believe that exxons plan modified by me addresses these 
concerns as well as the inputs of the various agencies and 
communities affected 
exxon spokesman joe tucker said the company was pleased with 
ciancaglinis approval 
while we have only just reviewed his letter the conditions 
accompanying his approval all appear to be appropriate for the 1990 
program tucker said 
use of the fertilizers to speed the growth of oileating 
bacteria has been opposed by some land managers including the 
national park service who say not enough is known about the 
possible toxicity of the fertilizers 
exxon already is working on plans to protect 
culturalarchaeological resources tucker said 
the admiral just wanted it in writing said coast guard 
spokeswoman gail williams were talking the same program but we 
just want to make sure its done

other animals 
the tankers skipper joseph hazelwood was convicted in march 
of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil into state

donald trump plans to sell stock in his 
casino empire in order to raise cash without taking on new debt or 
giving up control according to a newspaper report today 
trump would offer nonvoting stock to raise cash as part of a 
complex deal that includes swapping trump castle hotel amp casino for 
the extremely profitable flamingo hilton in las vegas the 
philadelphia inquirer reported 
the newspaper said several signs point in the direction of an 
impending deal between trump and the hilton hotels corp including 
remarks made on thursday by chairman barron hilton after the 
companys annual meeting 
hilton said he was looking into buying the trump castle 
which he built for 320 million trump bought it after the new 
jersey casino control commission worried about hiltons ties to a 
reputed mob lawyer denied him a gaming license in 1985 
also on thursday the inquirer reported trump executive mike 
rumbolz told a las vegas television station that trump would soon 
make an investment in a las vegas casino

trump to sell stock because profits would not depend on a single 
gaming market the recently renovated flamingo hilton the nations 
largest hotel with 3530 rooms is across the strip from two of las 
vegas top properties caesars palace and the mirage 
merrill lynch the brokerage that sold 675 million of bonds to

chief 
tracy said no final decision has been made to offer stock and 
that trump continues to examine all options for restructuring his 
real estate and casino empire 
trump has said he wants to raise cash by selling assets and 
refinancing properties recent published reports have suggested 
that trump is squeezed for cash he denies it saying he wants to 
have more cash on hand to acquire additional properties 
forbes magazine estimated that trumps interest costs are 381 
million per year greater than the cash his businesses generate 
business week pegged the annual shortfall caused by interest

a major party may withdraw from east 
germanys coalition government in a dispute over unification talks 
with west germany a party official was quoted as saying today 
leaders of the social democrats were debating whether to 
withdraw from the nations first democratic government said the 
partys executive manager stephen hilsberg 
there are several leading members of the spd faction who 
advocate leaving the coalition he said in an interview to be 
published sunday in the west german newspaper bild am sonntag the 
interview was released today to other news media 
hilsbergs comments were the latest and strongest sign of 
widening cracks in the government of prime minister lothar de 
maiziere 
social democrats hold several key ministries a decision to 
leave the coalition would force the prime minister to forge a new 
alliance with some of the smaller political factions in parliament 
de maizieres conservative alliance finished first in east 
germanys first free elections on march 18 and the leftleaning 
social democrats finished second 
despite differences on the speed of german unification the 
parties agreed to form a coalition government to present a united 
front to west germany at the bargaining table 
de maiziere also wanted the broadest coalition possible to 
ensure the twothirds majority in parliament needed to enact 
constitutional changes necessary for unification 
de maizieres party dominated the national elections by 
promising voters prosperty through unification and a quick shift to 
a freemarket economy 
there have been growing signs of worker unrest since then 
because of predictions that east germany will face wide 
unemployment when many outmoded east german factories now 
supported by the state are forced to compete 
hilsberg said the strikes are a sign that east german officials 
must press for a better financial deal 
experts from both germanys continued talks in bonn the west 
german capital today on a state treaty to go into effect on july 
2 when the germanys expect to merge their economies and social 
institutions 
de maiziere is a freemarket conservative who like west german 
chancellor helmut kohl believes a market economy will create jobs 
and raise living standards for east germans after unification 
the social democrats want more social guarantees and limits on 
price increases to ease the transition from a socialist system 
where food employment and housing are heavily subsidized 
they also want protection from foreign imports 
de maiziere already has persuaded west germany to agree to 
convert salaries and pensions earned by east germans to west german 
marks at an equal 11 conversion rate 
west germany also has said it will convert at a 11 rate 
personal savings of up to 3500 for people over age 60 and 2300 
for other adults higher amounts would be converted at a 21 rate 
hilsberg said the social democrats want a 5800 limit for older 
people 
influencing the negotiations is the west german elections in 
early december west german politicians want to avoid alienating 
west germans who fear they may have less buying power and pay 
higher taxes as the cost of bailing out the ailing east german 
economy 
the west german social democrats kohls main threat in the 
elections told the government today not to forget west germans in 
the unification talks 
ingrid matthaeusmaier a lawmaker and the partys financial 
expert warned of joblessness and social problems in west germany 
after unification

a federal ruling has struck down a 
longstanding north carolina law that exempted bibles from state 
sales tax 
the north carolina civil liberties union argued the 1939 law was 
a violation of the first amendment the amendment says the 
government cannot favor one religion over another 
in an unanimous decision the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
in richmond va issued the ruling on thursday overturning a 
ruling by us district judge james c fox of north carolina fox 
had dismissed the case in january 1989 on technical grounds 
the court said that exempting the bible but not other 
literature forces the state to discriminate on the basis of the 
contents of a book text or other published work which is 
intolerable under the first amendment 
one of the plaintiffs in the case a retired baptist minister 
said the ruling was victory for religious freedom 
i think this is a victory for religious liberty and for the 
equality of all faiths in our country said the rev ww 
finlator pastor emeritus of raleighs pullen memorial baptist 
church 
finlator and four other people from the hindu jewish and hare 
krisna faiths joined the civil liberties union in filing the case 
in january 1989 
the state attorney generals office defended the practice 
saying the exemption also applied to sacred books from other 
religions but the plaintiffs argued that bookstores gave tax 
breaks only to people buying bibles 
an employee at waldenbooks in raleigh confirmed that practice 
friday when asked if sacred books of other religions receive the 
tax exemption 
only bibles said the employee who declined to give her 
name this is the bible belt baby 
north carolina has exempted the bible along with a number of 
other items such as false teeth prescription eyeglasses and 
livestock feed from sales tax since 1939 
donald laton the assistant state attorney general who handled 
the case said he did not want to comment until he had read the 
appeals courts ruling

moslem guerrillas in his homeland to stop fighting the marxist 
regime and instead seek power through elections 
zaher shahs call came a few days after moslem rebels said they 
would reject any ussoviet deal to end their 11yearold fight to 
oust kabuls government 
he issued his appeal in a written statement issued in rome 
where he has lived in exile since 1973 when his cousin mohammad 
doaud staged a coup with the help of afghanistans communists 
discussions about how to end the afghan civil war are expected 
to be high on the agenda when president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev meet in washington later this month the 
united states sends arms and financial aid to the rebels as moscow 
does for the afghan government 
western diplomats and observers in pakistan say one possible 
peace agreement could involve free elections run by the united 
nations and the organization of islamic conference or by a neutral 
body chosen by both organizations 
zaher shah said the guerrillas should not now lay claim to 
political leadership without preparing the opportunity of referring 
it to the vote of the afghan people 
afghanistans loose coalition of rebel groups is deeply divided 
adding to the political difficulties is afghan president 
najibullahs refusal to step down before any elections a 
condition set by even the most moderate guerrilla groups 
moderates have pushed for the restoration of the 75yearold 
king as the only way to avoid a bloody struggle among rival 
guerrilla groups 
but some radicals have accused the united states of plotting to 
return zaher shah to afghanistan to prevent the formation of an 
islamic government 
the former monarch said today he has no personal consideration 
or claim to any special privilege whatsoever my sole objective is 
the attainment of national unity and cohesion among the various 
sides of afghan society and the establishment of peace in the 
country 
in the past zaher shah has said he is ready to offer any 
service in the search for a peaceful political settlement in his 
homeland following the withdrawal of soviet troops in early 1989 
for nine years more than 103000 soviet soldiers fought 
alongside afghan communist troops trying to crush the rebels the 
soviet troops were withdrawn in accordance with a unbrokered 
agreement

a 5yearold girl allegedly abducted by her baby 
sitter thought their 39day trip to florida was a vacation her 
parents say 
nicole ravesi was found safe in a florida panhandle fishing 
village thursday night and 24yearold kenneth m cole ii was 
arrested on a federal kidnapping charge 
the girls parents debra and frank ravesi spoke to reporters 
friday at bostons logan airport on their return from florida with 
their daughter 
ravesi said the family had learned from the ordeal not to let 
anyone get as close to our family as we did before 
authorities said cole became obsessed with nicole after 
babysitting for her and kidnapped her april 3 after mrs ravesi 
informed him he could no longer see the girl 
during the time on the road cole had nicole call him dad 
and had asked her to dress up as a little boy mrs ravesi said 
the girls hair had been trimmed during her disappearance 
mrs ravesi said nicole did not understand what had happened to 
her 
she thinks she was on vacation with a friend mrs ravesi 
said 
medical examinations showed nicole had not been abused in any 
way her mother said 
cole could face life imprisonment if convicted on a federal 
kidnapping charge prosecutors said he would also be charged in 
massachusetts and could face charges in any other state that he and 
the girl traveled through 
cole could be flown back to massachusetts over the weekend with 
a possible court appearance monday said susan spurlock a 
spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in boston 
the girl and her accused abductor had been living in a travel 
trailer in east port fla since late last month after spending 
time at the pine ridge lodge in panama city beach fla 
authorities said 
cole a former coworker of mrs ravesis had lost his job as a 
bus driver and frequently babysat for the family in the months 
before the abduction the ravesis said 
when nicole was hospitalized last year for a hip infection the 
hospital staff reported cole to the department of social services 
because they saw him kissing her on the lips 
social workers told the family in february that coles 
attachment to nicole seemed to be obsessive the ravesis obtained a 
restraining order against cole to prevent him from seeing or 
speaking to nicole 
the couple says they allowed cole to see the child twice after 
the fiveday restraining order expired because they thought he was 
harmless 
the ravesis arrived in tallahassee fla on a private jet 
provided by the fox network television program americas most 
wanted 
the case was featured on the show three times last month said 
james cagnassola jr the fbi agent in charge for north florida 
tips from the program and other television broadcasts led to coles 
arrest

a top iranian official called for the 
release of western hostages in lebanon and said washington could 
show good will by releasing billions of dollars in iranian assets 
a newspaper reported today 
the tehran times quoted hussein musavian directorgeneral of 
irans foreign ministry as saying the recent release of two 
americans held in lebanon was due to his countrys efforts 
we believe that all countries especially those that have 
influence in lebanon should exert their maximum efforts for the 
release of the hostages he said 
the criteria for these efforts should be to release all 
hostages regardless of their nationality solely for humanitarian 
causes and without an preconditions or deals 
it was the latest in a series of conflicting statements by 
iranian officials on the 16 western hostages in lebanon most of 
whom are held by proiranian shiite moslem groups 
the government of president hashemi rafsanjani has pressed for 
freedom for the captives as a way to improve relations with the 
west to thereby get help rebuilding irans economy 
but radicals argue that holding the hostages is a means of 
confronting the west which they view as evil and working against 
the interests of iran 
after the april release of americans robert polhill 55 and 
frank reed 57 iran and the hostageholders demanded a goodwill 
gesture from the united states before further releases 
president bush has thanked iran and syria for their efforts in 
securing the releases but has refused to negotiate for hostages 
musavian said that as long as the united states continues its 
hostile and negative attitude toward iran relations between 
the countries will not improve 
their hands are free for taking positive practical steps such 
as the release of iranian assets frozen by them for years he was 
quoted as saying in an interview in vienna with austrian 
journalists 
the united states and iran agreed wednesday on settling about 
3200 claims together worth about 50 million filed against the 
iranian government by us citizens who were in iran during the 
islamic revolution in 1979 
most of the claims involve loss of personal property and their 
settlement was believed to be a step toward settling a 
multibilliondollar dispute that began in 1979 after washington 
froze iranian assets 
iran says the assets amount to 11 billion but the united 
states says the figure is exaggerated 
the western hostages in lebanon include six americans four 
britons two germans two swiss an italian and an irishman 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

an explosion rocked a panamanian tanker drydocked 
in the houston ship channel setting the ship ablaze and injuring 
at least three crew members before the fire was extinguished this 
morning authorities said 
authorities closed the channel after the fire aboard the seta 
was reported about 6 pm friday to keep flames from spreading to 
other ships but the blaze was extinguished about 12 hours later 
and ship channel officials allowed oneway traffic around the 
drydocked tanker 
all the significant fires are out on the tanker but we are 
posting a reflash watch where firefighters make sure there are no 
hot spots that might catch fire again said coast guard lt mary 
landry 
houston firefighters working from fireboats in the channel had 
battled the threealarm blaze through the night at least three 
firefighters who entered the burning ship were treated for heat 
exhaustion 
no deaths were reported aboard the 374foot tanker and 
authorities believed most of its 20 to 25 crew members were 
accounted for but firefighters had been unable by early today to 
enter the lowest compartments of the ship to determine whether all 
had escaped 
the flames apparently were confined to the ships crew quarters 
and had not spread to the cargo hold which contained residues of 
four explosive chemicals methane acetone kerosene and hexane 
said fire department spokesman joe phillips 
none of the tanks are on fire coast guard lt robert said 
late friday but thats a concern of ours theres some very 
flammable gas in those tanks it is possible there could be 
explosions so were spraying a lot of water on them to keep them 
cool 
the injured crew members suffered burns said dr paul pepe 
head of houstons emergency medical services two were in good 
condition and one in fair condition early today 
the coast guard was investigating a report that combustible 
acetone spilled into the channel from the seta or another ship and 
ignited triggering the explosion 
we had just finished eating dinner when we heard an explosion 
i just jumped off into the water i dont know where it came 
from said mandic dusko a yugoslavian electrician on the seta 
i was sitting here in my camper eating supper and it sounded 
like when a big heavy slab of steel drops like a crane falling 
said alabama brown 43 a houston ship repair co welder working 
nearby i looked out and saw yellow flames about as high as that 
yellow crane over there it just kind of shook the place 
the seta was in drydock to be cleaned officials said

east german authorities have 
decided not to prosecute former hardline communist leader erich 
honecker citing his failing health a topranking official said in 
an interview published today 
we had 40 years of injustice east german interior minister 
petermichael diestel told the hamburg newspaper welt am sonntag 
we dont want to build up democracy with yet another injustice 
honecker now 77 years old ruled east germany with an iron fist 
for 18 years before his ouster by a prodemocracy revolution in 
october 1989 
since then he has become the focal point of public resentment 
against the hardline communists who controlled every facet of 
life 
late last year caretaker communist authorities announced that 
they would charge honecker with high treason a charge that carries 
a life sentence they said other officials from honeckers regime 
could also be prosecuted 
authorities later reduced the planned charges to corruption and 
abuse of office he was accused of embezzling state funds to build 
vacation homes and buy luxuries 
honecker was arrested in january after undergoing surgery for 
kidney cancer and was freed the next day

floodwaters that wreaked havoc in texas arkansas 
and oklahoma swelled into louisiana today and forecasters said 
residents in lowlying areas were not out of danger 
intermittent rains fell friday in the region and were forecast 
for the next few days 
the crest of the trinity river which soaked north texas after 
heavy rains a week ago headed for the gulf coast and authorities 
warned residents northeast of houston to expect more flooding by 
next week 
about 7000 lowland residents downstream of lake livingston dam 
60 miles northeast of houston were told to evacuate their 
subdivisions three subdivisions in liberty county remained cut off 
from main roads by rising water said jim mitchum the countys 
emergency management coordinator 
however many homes in the area sit on ninefoot stilts and 
most people are riding it out he said 
among the dangers of staying put are butane and propane tanks 
floating downstream and smashing into homes and fire ants by the 
pound floating on debris into homes along with racoons and 
snakes he said 
snakes and fire ants like to ride out the floods too 
mitchum said and theres nothing like seeing fire ants piled a 
foot high coming right at you 
the army corps of engineers said the volume of water expected to 
move through northwestern louisiana as the red river drains along 
the texasoklahoma border and through arkansas would exceed the 
record floods of 1927 and 1957 but that levees and other flood 
control systems built since then would prevent a flood disaster 
however about 20 people evacuated from a trailer park friday as 
the red attacked levees near shreveports downtown airport 
in natchitoches parish la contractors were building a ring 
levee on bayou poisson five miles east of natchitoches to keep 
the red from backing up into the cane river and flooding parts of 
the city 
elsewhere in the parish in the vick community about 50 
farmers using bulldozers tractors and plows worked to build up 
an earthen levee to keep the water from flooding all their fields 
the corps of engineers said the makeshift levee was three to 
five miles long friday thats a major undertaking to build 
something that long that fast said michael logue chief of 
public relations for the corps vicksburg miss district 
along the oklahoma border nearly 200 national guardsmen 
continued working around the clock to reinforce levees in the 
texarkana area where 40 homes were completely submerged 
twentyfive texas counties have been designated as federal 
disaster areas due to flooding which has killed a dozen people in 
texas and one in oklahoma 
white house action on oklahoma gov henry bellmons request for 
federal aid for 36 of the states 77 counties was expected next 
week bellmon asked president bush on friday for the disaster 
assistance 
for days mike cox and his family labored to build an earthen 
wall to keep the rising red river out of their convenience store in 
fulton ark on friday the river won 
their dike crumbled covering the familys main source of income 
with water 
its very disheartening said cox who also lost some nearby 
farmland to floodwater 
texas gov bill clements flew over the trinity and the red 
rivers friday to view for himself the worst flooding in his state 
since the early 1900s 
clements met with the president in kingsville where bush 
addressed the graduating class of texas aampi university clements 
said bush promised to do his best to aid flood victims 
the governor aboard a twinengine airplane watched national 
guardsmen and volunteers shore up levees near texarkana evacuees 
leaving lowlying areas along the trinity livestock being moved to 
higher dryer ground and a texas national guard helicopter dropping 
bales of hay to stranded cattle in northcentral texas 
clements also authorized use this weekend of a texas guard 
helicopter and crew to drop hay to floodmarooned livestock along 
the red river in arkansas the arkansas national guard doesnt own 
a helicopter clements office said 
hes done everything he can from austin said clements 
press secretary rossanna salazar and out of concern for the 
situation he wanted to see it firsthand 
the trinity river authority which normally releases less than 
15000 cubic feet per second of water at lake livingston on friday 
released 39300 cubic feet per second it warned of record releases 
as high as 85000 cubic feet for five days next week 
maj jack sherer of the us army corps of engineers warned that 
banks along the red river are soft from so much water and pose a 
threat 
you could easily slide right into the river and theres not 
much chance of surviving he said

canadas constitutional crisis simmering on the 
back burner for the past eight years has come to a boil with the 
approach of the june 23 deadline for bringing feisty 
frenchspeaking quebec province into the fold 
the 6 million quebecois who have struggled for two centuries to 
preserve the difference between their province and the rest of 
canada want that linguistic and cultural distinction acknowledged 
in the constitution 
some englishspeaking canadians find the idea repugnant the 
disagreement over a constitutional amendment to address quebecs 
concerns has led to renewed fears that the province might opt for 
independence and go it alone 
canadas new constitution was approved in 1982 over quebecs 
objections it applies in the province but the lack of unanimity 
left what mcgill university law professor jeremy webber calls a 
rankling sore 
to remedy the problem prime minister brian mulroney and the 
premiers of all 10 provinces met in april 1987 at a government 
retreat called meech lake near ottawa they agreed on a 
constitutional amendment that addressed quebecs five main concerns 
a threeyear deadline was set for ratification by provincial 
legislatures and all gave their approval except manitoba and new 
brunswick newfoundlands legislature ratified the meech lake 
accord but withdrew the approval after a change of government 
its all off unless unanimous ratification is achieved by june 
23 
what we are doing now is completing what was done in 1981 and 
1982 said gil remillard quebecs minister for intergovernmental 
affairs 
despite frequently heated debate and constant press coverage 
few people seem to have read the meech lake agreement or know what 
it contains the only part virtually everyone is familiar with and 
where the major controversy lies is the section that calls quebec 
a distinct society 
that would oblige the supreme court to take quebecs 
distinctiveness into account when considering specific laws whose 
constitutionality was being challenged it is an enormously 
significant symbol to frenchspeaking quebecois 
mulroney has said recognizing quebec as a distinct society 
simply confirms the obvious quebec is different and that 
difference is very much worth conserving in the interest of all 
canadians 
opposition is of two basic kinds antifrench feeling that is 
difficult to measure and the belief that canada is one country and 
the rules should be the same for all 
the concept of a single canada is a strong argument said 
webber the mcgill professor that kind of position has a lot of 
real gut appeal even among those who are very favorable to the 
french fact in canada 
premier frank mckenna of new brunswick trying to break the 
impasse proposed a companion resolution to meech lake that now 
is the subject of parliamentary committee hearings 
it mainly involves the four other points in the agreement the 
role of the provinces on immigration allowing provinces to opt out 
of federal sharedcost programs requiring annual conferences of 
the prime minister and provincial premiers and the formula for 
amending the constitution 
quebec says it will not accept changes in the accord or discuss 
related issues until it is approved 
if meech lake doesnt pass that means our five points have 
been rejected remillard said adding that quebecs governing 
liberal party was studying what action to take in that event 
there are people who will feel profoundly affected if it 
doesnt pass he said there will be consequences 
the widespread sentiment in quebec and elsewhere is that a deal 
will be made before june 23 perhaps to accept the accord as is and 
convene a constitutional conference to devise companion measures 
remillard said a meeting of the prime minister and premiers 
probably would be held this month 
polls indicate nationalist sentiment in quebec is growing 
quebecois feel they were humiliated in 1982 and that they 
cannot submit to a second humiliation but nobody has an interest 
in separation except maybe the parti quebecois said vincent 
lemieux a political scientist and analyst at laval university in 
quebec 
businessmen in quebec always strongly federalists support the 
meech lake accord but guy boulanger vice president of the quebec 
chamber of commerce said they were ready to take the separatist 
road if the agreement was rejected 
the businessmen of quebec want to do business he said we 
have talked enough the time has come we dont want a breakup of 
canada thats the last thing we want but we are ready to live 
with it 
little passion is evident in the nationalist sentiment 
interviews with a range of quebecois indicated few really wanted 
separation from canada and that it would be calm if it occurred 
neither the provincial nor national government wants separation 
as mulroney put it what is at stake is enormous and what is in 
dispute is modest

do television viewers need another program 
showcasing the video gimmickry of video camera owners nbc seems to 
think so 
the network will broadcast the premiere of doityourself tv 
sunday night a slightly different but unmistakable hybrid of 
abctvs toprated americas funniest home videos 
dick clark who is producing and serving as cohost of the new 
show says he thinks people love to watch the latest rave no 
matter how many times its duplicated 
he should know when he did tvs bloopers amp practical jokes 
for nbc six years ago it started its own copycat bonanza abc 
quickly announced it was doing a celebrity show called foulups 
bleeps amp blunders 
how many video shows can the market stand 
they asked the same question when bloopers came to the 
fore clark said thursday in a phone interview from new york 
and there were three on at the time 
bloopers had some home video segments but we werent 
smart enough to think of home video bloopers clark said 
people in our office were somewhat exercised by the success 
of abcs home video show which premiered as a series in january 
four years after bloopers was canceled clark said 
if youre not smart enough to think of a new angle you cant 
feel bad about it he said 
when nbc approached clark about doityourself tv a new 
angle was exactly what the network wanted 
cbs had virtually owned sunday evenings beginning with the 7 
pm broadcast of its venerable 60 minutes but abc with a 
program that showed americas warts and stumbles was now no 1 in 
the time spot 
for doityourself tv we came back with the idea of 
sending these amateur videographers out on assignment clark 
said theres nothing socially redeeming about these assignments 
theyre just crazy 
like having six fully uniformed motorcycle cops singing 
feelings and stop in the name of love taping how silly 
people look and sound when they sing along to earphones on their 
heads and a pizzeria where the customers are invited to throw a 
little dough 
youre not going to learn anything youre not going to retain 
any of it clark said its like junk food its entertainment 
and im not ashamed of that

like all savvy politicians sen james sasser 
has his mind riveted on two different spots on the eve of next 
weeks budget summit his adversaries and peoria ill 
the senate budget committee chairman is among 21 lawmakers who 
begin bargaining with president bush on tuesday on how to slash the 
federal deficit going in sasser and the 10 other democratic 
negotiators have two major worries 
why spend weeks haggling over tax increases spending cuts and 
other politically perilous moves if the public is not demanding 
action to shrink the budget gap they ask 
as far as the lady in peoria is concerned she doesnt see the 
problem sasser dtenn said last week 
democrats want bush to publicly explain how bad the deficit 
situation is so an unconcerned public doesnt blame democrats for 
whatever painful measures emerge from the talks 
they also see this as a way to spur congress into approving any 
deficitreduction plan that is negotiated 
unless we do a better job convincing the american public this 
is a serious problem it will be difficult to get a package that 
can be adopted by either house said house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif 
also troubling democrats is the question of why the 
administration is so eager to talk now about the deficit problem 
some of them think they scent a whiff of politics in the air 
democrats agree with the white houses concern that an economic 
slowdown could be on the way unemployment ticked upward last 
month and there is unease over whether interest rates may be 
heading upward 
democrats also accept administration budget chief richard 
darmans new projections that theres a need to find 60 billion to 
100 billion in savings for next year that is the amount of cuts 
necessary to reduce the 1991 deficit to 64 billion the target set 
by the grammrudman law 
even in a 12 trillion budget 60 billion to 100 billion is 
an enormous sum its also double the 37 billion in savings bush 
said would be necessary when he unveiled his 1991 budget last 
january 
this makes democrats suspicious because the only thing new about 
darmans deficit forecast is that darman is making it others have 
been expecting the shortfall to be that high for months 
since january democrats have been complaining that the 
administration was underestimating the size of the shortfall they 
argued that bush was counting on a strong performance by the 
economy that was unlikely 
the same month bush proposed his budget the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office estimated that 74 billion in budget 
cuts would be needed next year the private publication blue chip 
financial forecast surveyed 50 economists and found a consensus 
that 54 billion in savings would be necessary not including the 
tens of billions needed to bail out the savings and loan industry 
many democrats believe the administration simply wants to 
administer whatever tough medicine the economy needs now rather 
than wait and risk a downturn close to bushs 1992 reelection 
campaign 
there is some sense the economy is in trouble sasser said 
last week even if it staggers through this year and the first of 
next year you might have a recession by the time the president is 
getting his election campaign geared up 
other theories abound among democrats 
some think republicans want to trap democrats into backing an 
electionyear tax increase others think bush was frightened by the 
recent passage by the senate budget committee and the full house of 
democraticwritten budgets that slashed the presidents defense 
program 
whats clear is if bush and congress do not agree to reduce the 
deficit the grammrudman law will do it automatically 
without a budget deal the law will slash defense and domestic 
spending on oct 1 the start of fiscal 1991 by whatever amount 
is needed to shrink the deficit to 64 billion most in washington 
agree that such cuts would be unbearable for the millions of 
americans who rely on the government for aid and for business 
the president thinks this is a good opportunity to get going 
that times a wasting said rep bill frenzel of minnesota 
ranking republican on the house budget committee we dont have a 
lot of time to work this out

womens groups are in a quandary over which 
us senate candidate to back in illinois where the choice is 
between sending a woman to the senate and reelecting a longtime 
ally who happens to be male 
there has been no rush by womens groups to endorse fiveterm 
republican rep lynn martin in her bid to oust liberal democratic 
sen paul simon 
the national organization for women whose goals include 
electing more women to the senate doesnt know whom to choose 
the national womens political caucus also is undecided and the 
womens campaign fund which has backed martin in the past plans 
to stay on the sidelines 
the race is one of the most closely watched senate contests in 
the country this year with simon 61 leading in public opinion 
polls thus far 
paul simon has been there for us on a lot of occasions said 
patricia ireland vice president of now its a very tough thing 
im sitting here with big question marks over my head 
martin 50 is trying to convince voters that simon a 
democratic presidential nominee in 1988 is a taxloving liberal 
who is too concerned with issues outside the state like her 
opponent martin supports abortion rights 
ireland said the simonmartin matchup creates a difficult choice 
for now because the group is interested in the feminization of 
power but also values simons stalwart support 
theres a large part of our organization that feels very 
strongly that women ought to be given the benefit of the doubt in 
every case ireland said a number of our people are very 
interested in lynn martins campaign for that reason and also to 
strengthen the prochoice republican part of the party 
affection for simon aside now is concerned about martins 
conservative record on economic issues she has received high marks 
from the probusiness us chamber of commerce and low marks from 
labor 
there are people who look at lynn martins various votes and 
question whether shes going to be more probusiness in ways that 
will mean shes not going to be able to support employee benefits 
that were looking for ireland said 
martin softened that image thursday when she was one of only 39 
republicans to vote for a house bill that would grant unpaid leaves 
to workers who have family emergencies legislation pushed by 
womens groups 
martin says the only way to elect more women to the senate is 
for groups like now to give challengers a chance currently there 
are two women in the 100member senate democrat barbara mikulski 
of maryland and republican nancy kassebaum of kansas 
if part of your constitution says we need more women in 
office then they need to look at opportunities and say hey 
weve got a chance for one martin said 
if you say well this incumbent has been good to us it 
means youll never be supporting women because women are always 
the challengers 
several groups with female constituencies have decided to back 
simon or stay out of the race some like the national womens 
political caucus are simply waiting for martin to show some 
interest 
we sent her a questionnaire and it has not been returned 
said beth bourland who heads the groups illinois chapter 
she has not solicited the caucus endorsement bourland 
said i would think she would want to garner all the strength she 
could get 
martin said her campaign was trying to contact all groups her 
campaign spokeswoman kathy lydon said martin had no endorsements 
to report but suggested it was too early 
well be reaching out to as many as possible especially 
womens business groups lydon said 
the womens campaign fund which helped martin during her house 
elections is remaining neutral in the illinois senate race but in 
rhode island it is backing republican rep claudine schneiders bid 
to oust democratic sen claiborne pell 
lynn martin is solidly prochoice no question about it 
said the funds jane danowitz but weve traditionally had a 
policy of not supporting women who challenge incumbents solid on 
our issues 
the national abortion rights action league credits simon for 
having consistently shown leadership and has contributed at 
least 5000 to his campaign said naral spokeswoman loretta ucelli

battling a proliferation of racial and ethnic 
tensions mayor david dinkins called on new yorkers to fight 
prejudice where they live and promised to do whatever is necessary 
to quell public disturbances 
dinkins who had been criticized for not acting forcefully 
enough against a rash of racerelated incidents gave a halfhour 
speech friday night carried live by several local television and 
radio stations 
new yorks first black mayor said the nations largest city has 
many problems including expensive housing crack and aids 
epidemics and a faltering economy 
unfortunately some smallminded people prey upon these 
pressures spreading a message not of unity but of division i 
challenge all of the people of this city to reject these calls to 
bigotry he said 
all of us want to live our lives in peace and dignity free 
to walk any street and shop in any store at any time in any 
neighborhood without fear of force or violence 
a few hours before he spoke scores of demonstrators jostled a 
defense attorney outside a brooklyn courtroom where juries are 
weighing evidence against two white men charged in the august 
shooting of a black teenager 
some have warned that violence is possible if the juries do not 
return murder verdicts for keith mondello and joseph fama in the 
death of 16yearold yusuf hawkins the two juries one for each 
defendant resumed work this morning 
a banner hung between two trees outside the court read civil 
rights or civil war 
dinkins said violence was unwarranted despite frustrations and 
said he would do whatever is necessary to maintain security and 
public order 
he offered to personally negotiate an end to a 4monthold 
boycott against two korean stores in the brooklyn borough 
the boycott began over a tussle between a black customer and a 
storeowner but picketing protesters have appealed to underlying 
resentment against immigrants with ethnic slurs and calls for the 
koreans to go home 
dinkins said this is bigger than just one boycott in 
brooklyn 
a brawl erupted last week at a brooklyn college during a speech 
by a professor who believes in white superiority a columbia 
university sports banquet was disrupted by a soccer players verbal 
attack on homosexuals and jews 
in a muchpublicized case pulitzer prizewinning columnist 
jimmy breslin was suspended for two weeks by new york newsday after 
slurring an asianamerican coworker 
michael kang executive director of the korean produce 
association called dinkins speech diplomatic a cosmetic 
treatment nothing more nothing less of dinkins offer to 
mediate the conflict surrounding the korean markets kang said 
we want it to stop immediately no more talking 
the rev al sharpton who earlier this week said violence could 
erupt if the hawkins defendants is not found guilty said the 
mayors speech was long overdue 
i think its three months too late said sharpton the 
fact that the mayor goes on television to say were not in a 
tinderbox situation shows that were in a tinderbox situation 
dinkins called bigotry an old story a cycle of immigration 
and discrimination thats as old as this city itself 
blacks jews and immigrants from ireland italy and other 
countries have all faced violence he said 
new times bring new americans who become new targets he 
said 
dinkins outlined a plan to help heal divisions around the city 
including the formation of a law enforcement group to battle gang 
activities and develop a new law against mob violence 
he also called for the city to study discrimination in 
banklending practices and create a new bias strike force

in recent months the soviet union has 
seen many hostile confrontations between crowds representing 
opposite points of view and in the southern republics such 
confrontations have turned violent 
in latvia a recent standoff turned into a singoff 
in the tense hours before the may 4 vote on independence a 
crowd of proponents and opponents of the measure stood toetotoe 
outside the supreme soviet parliament but instead of fisticuffs or 
insults they ended up trying to drown each other out with their 
rendition of soviet and latvian songs 
after independence was passed and thousands converged on the 
daugava rivers bank for a celebration it was time to sing some 
more not just one song but a whole concert from on the shores 
of the daugava to not through laziness and waste a song 
touting the virtues of diligence 
we always sing this much a latvian said between refrains 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was two days after latvias declaration of independence and 
the soviet army was trying to put on its best face at riga military 
stadium for the annual world war ii victory day show 
there were parachutists prancing horses motorcycle daredevils 
and race cars competing for applause under the hot may sun 
but if the exhibition this year could also be interpreted as a 
show of force aimed at secessionminded latvians then the real 
clincher was yet to come 
a young soldier set up a pile of bricks topped them with some 
tiles poured gasoline on them and set them ablaze the soldier 
suddenly squatted and demolished the flaming foothigh pile with 
his head 
</TEXT>

in the stands col general fyodor kuzmin commander of the 
baltic military district steadfastly ignored two western reporters 
throughout the event 
he also refused to be interviewed when the show was over 
but maybe he just didnt want to stand up as he stalked away 
the seat of his dress uniform revealed white stains from the new 
whitewash on the stadiums benches

the signs usually seen at political protests in soviet republics 
condemn moscow as an imperialist occupying power 
but some of the diehard russians picketing outside latvias 
parliament building had slogans asking for mercy for the soviet 
union 
one sign depicted ravenous dogs tearing off chunks of the soviet 
map another said there have been worse times but none lower 
implying a betrayal of moscow 
theyre pulling the country apart like dogs svetlana 
marushchenko said when things are bad in the country you 
mustnt do things like this

the smithsonian institution is drawing heavy 
crowds and stirring some controversy with a huge new exhibit 
that traces the information revolution from samuel fb morses 
first primitive telegraph to an arcade of bleeping computer screens 
criticism of the information age show which opened 
wednesday for a permanent engagement at the national museum of 
american history stems partly from the decision to let corporate 
sponsors pick up the 10 million tab for the largest and perhaps 
the most expensive exhibition in smithsonian history 
the washington post raised the issue of corporate sponsorship in 
a lengthy critique of the exhibition and a reporter questioned 
museum director roger kennedy on the subject at a briefing last 
week 
kennedy insisted that the shows content was not influenced in 
any way by ibm atampt unysis xerox and other industry giants who 
completely bankrolled the exhibit 
he said the smithsonian was forced to rely on private support 
because congressional budget cuts had left his museum without any 
federal funds to mount major exhibitions 
he dismissed the suggestions of corporate pressure saying it 
was like being pelted with beer cans from the bleachers 
his boss secretary of the smithsonian robert mcc adams hinted 
at some personal misgivings over another aspect of the exhibition 
which climaxes with a daunting display of hightech wizardry 
im not satisfied we have the public well enough 
represented adams said 
adams said we need to do better in dealing with the impact 
of computer technology on human beings such as the potential for 
invasion of privacy the hacker problem and the boredom of sitting 
all day at a word processor 
for all that the exhibition is a undeniably a dazzler 
five years in the making it boasts 700 artifacts and as many 
graphics in 14000 square feet of gallery space on the museums 
ground floor which has been wired with more than 10 miles of extra 
cable 
the show includes 78 computers capable of handling a billion 
instructions every second and storing the equivalent of a million 
typewritten pages of information there are 43 video monitors 52 
laser videodisc players 20 touch screen displays and 24 
barcode scanners enough to equip checkout counters at a couple 
of supermarkets 
visitors begin with a view of morses original telegraph 
transmitter conceived in 1832 and exit through a stateoftheart 
chamber of wonders where the sound of billy taylors jazz piano can 
be transformed into a cathedral choir at the touch of a button 
in between the exhibit includes a working 2ton robot once 
used to weld automobile bodies at a general motors plant in 
delaware the r2d2 and c3po robots of star wars fame and the 
first public display of the longsecret mechanical computers or 
bombes that enabled the allies to decipher the germans vaunted 
enigma radio code in world war ii 
along the way there is a 1930s radio studio a newsreel 
theater early phonograph records and the television camera used to 
broadcast the historic kennedynixon presidential debate in 1960 
plus the univac i computer that predicted dwight d eisenhowers 
victory on election night of 1952 
smithsonian officials predicted that the information age 
will serve as a future model for other museums because of its 
unprecedented opportunities for handson visitor participation at 
computerized displays 
viewers can tap out the international distress signal at a 
recreation of the titanics radio room talk over the same 
telephone wire used by alexander graham bell punch in their 
demographic profiles to retrieve 1890 census data and analyze 
their fingerprints using the fbis early national crime 
identification center computer 
sitting at separate computer terminals visitors can simulate 
producing a tv news show handling a 911 emergency call or trading 
on the international currency market after a few minutes of 
frantic buying and selling based on news flashes on the screen 
the computer informed one visitor that hed just lost 28312 
this is the most ambitious the most wideranging and most 
prodigious show we have ever done and it will stay here adams 
said museum officials said the exhibit will be updated constantly 
to reflect technological advances and suggestions from visitors 
the movement processing and storage of huge and rapidly 
growing amounts of information is not something impersonal out 
there adams said the information age is probably the driving 
force in what has already differentiated us sharply from our 
grandparents

denis d gray traveled along nearly 300 miles of 
the thaiburmese border and into two areas of burma controlled by 
guerrillas this is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
companions said soe win a villager 
kidnapped by burmese troops collapsed on a forced border trek his 
strength sapped by lung disease and the huge load of rice and 
mortar shells on his back 
because he was no longer useful as a porter they said a 
soldier of the 66th infantry division smashed soe wins head 
against a rock half a dozen times and kicked his lifeless body down 
the mountainside two other porters said they witnessed the death 
and were able to escape 
many stories like theirs are heard along the frontier between 
thailand and burma a decadesold war between burmas repressive 
government and ethnic minorities seeking autonomy has turned the 
frontier into region of brutality deceit and despoiled 
environment and a growing tide of refugees is beginning to alarm 
foreign aid agencies 
the war initially attracted little attention because it was 
remote and burma kept foreigners out of the area but the scale and 
violence have grown dramatically in recent years 
after brutally crushing a prodemocracy uprising in september 
1988 the military rulers in rangoon turned their attention to the 
thai border 
burma was bankrupt but ethnic rebels were making millions of 
dollars smuggling consumer goods jade antiques timber and 
sometimes narcotics across a porous frontier 1350 miles long 
most of the world has shunned the rangoon generals who found 
allies in powerful thai military and business circles 
deals were made the thais got access to one of the worlds last 
great teak forests in exchange for hard currency part of which 
financed an army campaign to clear the border so the deals could be 
carried out 
conservation groups and the us congress have criticized the 
destruction of the forest 
the scale of the logging is mindboggling a western 
official said on condition of anonymity the thais are hacking it 
out as fast as they can they know the honeymoon wont last 
forever 
by most accounts the burmese armys border campaign has been 
ruthless 
refugees aid workers escaped porters and guerrillas along the 
frontier and in rebelcontrolled areas of burma told of villages 
razed and rice stocks burned 
they spoke of civilians tortured and shot including children 
of whole village populations taken from their homes and herded into 
areas controlled by the military 
two groups of porters totaling 50 men and boys ranging in age 
from a 57yearold farmer to a 14yearold cowherd described 
grueling marches starvation diets and walking ahead of the 
soldiers as human mine detectors 
others were shot down while trying to escape they said several 
of the survivors who included ethnic minorities and majority 
burmese had scars they said resulted from beatings 
wallace yay coordinator of aid to refugees from the karen 
minority in thailand said the burmese military has shown a 
willingness to shoot down its own but in minority areas it just 
lets loose 
i dont think genocide is too strong a term to describe what 
the burmese military is doing said court robinson of the us 
committee for refugees a private group it is clear they are 
trying to eliminate the ethnics as a political and cultural 
entity 
burma has denied such allegations including those amnesty 
international made in two detailed reports issued in 1988 
amnesty international a human rights group based in london 
cited a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights 
against the karen kachin mon karenni and shan minorities 
it and other organizations also have noted the use of terrorist 
tactics by guerrilla groups but no evidence has emerged that the 
scale or intensity of such acts approaches that of the army 
the border campaign has spurred flight into thailand increasing 
the number of refugees in the frontier area to at least 40000 
most are from ethnic minorities but they also include burmese 
students and other dissidents several thousand of whom joined the 
rebels during the 1988 repression 
robinson and other aid officials believe tens of thousands more 
may flee 
refugees say word that the burmese are coming is enough to send 
everyone in a village fleeing to the jungle 
thailands government does not grant refugee status to people 
who have fled burma little aid has been forthcoming from foreign 
agencies in contrast to the enormous international effort made for 
those from vietnam cambodia and laos who have sought refuge in 
thailand 
over the years the socalled forgotten refugees have 
received modest help from the private french agency doctors without 
borders and a consortium of more than a dozen christian groups 
now the needs are greater 
we cannot live on rice salt and fish paste for long said 
mya thein leader of 4000 karen civilians who crossed the border 
early in february he said some of the children had cholera 
about 150 burmese students and other dissidents live in a 
section of what is called mawke camp they ask why the world pays 
so much attention to those who fled military repression in china 
and so little to them in their crude huts and malarial jungle 
i think we will be here a long time said mya thein a high 
school principal who lost his left leg to a burmese mortar in 1987 
in the past the burmese would take an area hold it for a while 
and then retreat when the rains came now i think they will stay 
because of the logs 
rebel officers claim burmese troops have been allowed to use 
thai territory to surround karen positions and have been taken 
inside the teak forest in trucks owned by thai logging companies 
burmese students say thailands actions will not be forgotten if 
democracy comes to their country

meet his timetable 
its time to open up the final frontier he said in his 
address thirty years ago nasa was founded and the space race 
began and 30 years from now i believe man will stand on another 
planet

americas corporate leaders are 
tempering their belief in moderate growth for the us economy with 
concern about sluggishness in banking finance real estate and 
construction 
none of the 100 leaders of the nations top corporations at the 
semiannual meeting this weekend of the business council were heard 
to forecast a robust economy 
some however sprinkled their conversations with optimism about 
their individual business sectors aircraft automobiles heavy 
electric machinery pharmaceuticals and supermarket goods 
the corporate leaders heard their economists forecast a 
gradually accelerating us economy during 1990 and 1991 erasing 
fears of a recession projected at their last meeting at this 
mountain resort in october 
overall council economists said economic activity would grow 2 
percent this year and 26 percent in 1991 this included a 19 
percent expansion in the first half of this year and a 23 percent 
gain in the second half 
roger b smith council chairman and chairman of general motors 
corp indicated his belief the automobile industry was reviving 
from the economic doldrums of the past year 
although sales incentives may hurt earnings it does portend 
to be a pretty good year he said 
automobiles and other durable goods expensive items expected 
to last more than three years have been hurt in the last year by 
the federal reserves highinterest policies consumers generally 
must borrow to pay for those items 
the councils economists in a report friday raised the growth 
forecast for industrial production this year to 21 percent from an 
earlier estimate of 19 percent and production growth is 
expected to quicken to 28 percent during 1991 they said 
john f welch jr chairman of general electric co also said 
the aircraft industry which has huge backlogs of orders and the 
heavy electric machinery sector were very strong 
welch noted particularly an enormous worldwide need for power 
generation equipment he said the shortcycle sector 
lighting appliances plastic products was in moderate shape 
john g smale chairman of the procter amp gamble co said the 
consumer products business was strong both in the united states and 
abroad 
and edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer inc described the 
health care industry as being in another golden era 
there has been an explosion of new products in both 
pharmaceuticals and medical devices he said 
but both pratt and welch deplored the rising costs of health 
care saying they would prefer in welchs words a tradeoff a 
little weaker medical business in return for lower medical costs 
on the other hand several corporate leaders told of continuing 
weakness gripping their industries 
the banking business in the united states is going to be 
difficult tough said john s reed chairman of citicorp the 
huge new york bank 
part of the problem is a diminishing real estate market which 
he said continues to weaken corporate banking business also is 
not particularly strong he added 
reed said that while credit card use continues to be strong the 
banking industry is seeing some consumers taking longer to pay 
their debts 
another banking executive willard c butcher chairman of chase 
manhattan bank said the weakness in the corporate finance sector 
is a sign of the collapse of the junk bond market 
sd bechtel jr chairman of the giant engineering and 
construction company bearing his name said domestic construction 
spending is down although improvement is forecast for next year 
internationally there generally is more construction activity 
now than a year ago and we think its going to pick up bechtel

messages from soldiers stationed overseas 
are flooding the armys military radio system here with love best 
wishes and hugs for their stateside moms 
happy mothers day the money is on the way an army private 
in west germany said in his radiogram beamed from europe to his 
mother in las vegas love ya always one great big mommy hug 
the message was sent over the armys military affiliate radio 
system a network of 100 military stations and 4000 amateur radio 
operators who send and receive radio messages for soldiers 
worldwide 
its faster than the mail and cheaper than the telephone 
mothers day is the busiest day for mars which has a more 
important role of providing radio training for soldiers and 
emergency communications for military civil or disaster officials 
on fathers day you see a few but everybody i guess feels 
obligated to send to mom said tom moore who directs mars 
traffic in the eastern third of the united states from fort detrick 
in frederick 
happy mothers day mom you are the greatest wishing you to 
keep strong an army captain stationed in west germany said in 
his marsgram to his mom in utica ny 
the 400 messages a day received by fort detrick mars operators 
around mothers day exceed the number that soldiers send to their 
sweethearts on valentines day normally the fort detrick station 
receives about 100 messages a day 
soldiers can send messages free of charge from about 100 mars 
stations in a dozen countries the marsgrams then are bounced via 
radio waves to the nearest gateway or access station moore 
said 
the eastern area station at fort detrick is the busiest of six 
gateway stations in the army mars network which handles an 
estimated 650000 marsgrams each year 
the other domestic gateways are in bases near san antonio 
seattle and honolulu the foreign gateways are in seoul korea 
and lohnsfeld west germany 
the gateway station sends each message to a regional mars 
station which relays it to the appropriate state affiliate 
operator he said 
from that point the messages are handled by ham radio operators 
who volunteer a minimum 12 hours every three months to keep the 
mars network complete 
the operators who are licensed by the federal communications 
commission and trained in military communications relay the 
message among themselves until it is as close as possible to its 
destination the last radio operator picks up a telephone and calls 
the appropriate party with the soldiers message 
if its a toll call the operator is authorized to put it in 
the mail and the department of the army covers the cost of the 
postage moore said 
a earl vivino a 75yearold retired cardiologist from 
walkersville has been handling marsgrams for nearly 60 years 
as a doctor i know that the most important thing in life is 
helping people when youre sending a message youre helping 
people said vivino who handles about 100 messages a month 
theyre so happy to have someone give them a message from 
overseas 
there are some limits to the contents it cant be commercial 
and it cant be vulgar but just about anything else goes said 
moore he said the most risque message probably would be rated 
pg13 you cant do business you cant tell your broker to sell 
30 shares of this and buy 40 of that 
the mars network also allows soldiers stationed abroad to talk 
with relatives or friends in the united states for a fraction of 
the cost of an overseas call army mars handles about 6500 phone 
patches a year 
a soldier in west germany for example could get a radio 
connection with a mars operator in frederick that operator could 
call the soldiers family in west virginia and connect the phone to 
the radio hookup so the two parties could talk moore said 
the soldier or family would be billed for a longdistance call 
from frederick to west virginia rather than one from west germany 
to west virginia 
everything gets through moore said an incorrect address 
or phone number on the senders part is the only thing that screws 
it up

the senate is ready to vote on a nonbinding 
resolution that calls on president bush to do something about the 
persecution of an iranian religious sect 
despite some improvement in the way tehran treats members of the 
bahai religious faith many are still denied basic freedoms their 
representatives and lawmakers say 
the senate resolution which could be considered as early as 
tuesday expresses concern that the bahai community as a whole 
remains an oppressed minority which is denied legal recognition 
which would permit bahais to organize hold property operate 
religious schools 
the measure asks that the united states work with other 
governments to help the bahais and provide humanitarian assistance 
for those fleeing iran 
the house passed a similiar resolution on a 4040 vote in 
february house majority leader thomas foley dwash championed 
the measure 
although the senate resolution is nonbinding it comes at a 
time when the bush administration wants to see iran use its 
influence to help gain the release of american and other western 
hostages being held by proiranian groups in lebanon two americans 
have been released in recent weeks 
administration officials say there have been no deals to free 
the hostages and have called for the unconditional release of the 
seven americans who remain in captivity 
nontheless president bush has said that in his dealings with 
iran goodwill begets goodwill 
the resolutions principal sponsor sen christopher dodd 
dconn said the administration has not taken a position on the 
measure 
i havent heard from them dodd said last week 
but the 1989 state departments human rights report cited iran 
as a major violator of human rights treatment of the bahais 
was a big concern the report said 
resolutions such as the one criticizing iran have no legal 
muscle but they can have a broad impact on foreign affairs 
turkey for instance was so angry about a senate resolution on 
alleged armenian genocide that it threatened to close us military 
bases the measure pushed by senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan was defeated 
two months ago a group of lawmakers including dodd and sens 
john heinz rpa and rep lee hamilton dind chairman of a 
house middle east subcommittee wrote a letter to the un 
commission on human rights asking the group to act on behalf of 
bahais 
while conditions for individual bahas in iran have improved 
somewhat in recent months the community as a whole remains an 
oppressed minority they said 
we understand that iranian representatives have lobbied 
vigorously for the past decade against any un consideration of 
their countrys human rights practices and have opposed in 
particular any references to the bahais the letter said 
the united states and iran have no formal diplomatic relations 
they communicate through third parties and have facetoface 
contact at the iranunited states claims tribunal at the hague 
last week negotiators announced the united states and iran had 
arrived at a tentative 105 million settlement of more than 2000 
us small claims pending since the 1979 islamic revolution 
experts familiar with iran say that countrys leaders are eager 
for better relations with the united states and the west in general 
as they try to rebuild a country devastated by the eightyearold 
war with iran 
meantime jeffrey huffines a spokesman for the bahais in the 
united states said the congressional resolution and un concern 
have focused attention on the bahais and resulted in some 
improvement in their condition 
for instance he said only eight bahais remain imprisoned in 
iran in april food ration cards are available and some bahais 
have retrieved their confiscated property 
bahai children are also allowed in secondary schools but have 
not been able to enroll in universities he said there have been 
no executions of bahais since december 1988 
the bahai faith is a worldwide religion that originated in iran 
in the 1840s their faith is in conflict with islam which teaches 
there can be no revelations after mohammed some 1200 years before 
the bahais were organized

sandra schultzs worst nightmare came true 
last week when the man convicted of killing her 19yearold son and 
his fiance walked out of jail 
now her greatest dream is to see dale johnston behind bars 
again but prosecutors who dropped the case after a key piece of 
evidence was thrown out say they would reopen it only if new 
evidence surfaced 
johnston 56 was released from prison friday one day after an 
appeals court ruled inadmissible his statements to police linking 
him to the 1982 mutilation deaths of 18yearold annette cooper 
johnston who was johnstons stepdaughter and her fiance todd 
schultz 
the release shocked residents of this scenic southeastern ohio 
city of 6000 where the couples dismembered bodies were found in 
october 1982 10 days after they disappeared 
mrs schultz said friday that she was angered by the ruling that 
prompted prosecutors to drop the case against johnston prosecutors 
said they would reopen the investigation only if new convincing 
evidence is uncovered 
im still in shock she said im afraid to leave the 
house not because of him but because im afraid ill run into 
somebody who thinks hes innocent i just dont think i could take 
that 
she is convinced johnston shot the couple on his farm on oct 4 
1982 dismembered the bodies threw their torsos into the hocking 
river and buried other body parts in a nearby cornfield 
i saw him on tv last night and he kept saying that he wants 
out so he can find the real murderer she said i guess they 
dont allow mirrors in prison 
she said johnston hated her son because he was a rival for miss 
johnston prosecutors claimed at trial that johnston had sexually 
molested his stepdaughter 
johnston has repeatedly maintained his innocence at a news 
conference friday johnston said finding the killer was the one 
goal i have left he had served more than seven years in prison 
in the slayings and at one time was on death row 
his exwife sarah johnston mother of the slain woman voiced 
relief at the news conference that johnston was free 
its not going to bring her back its not going to ease the 
pain of having lost a daughter a future soninlaw 
grandchildren she said but its a great day 
johnstons first conviction was thrown out by the ohio supreme 
court in 1988 which ruled that a witness whose memory had been 
refreshed by hypnosis had been improperly allowed to testify he 
remained in custody without bond pending the second trial 
but that trial was put on hold last july after judge william 
gillie ruled that johnstons rights were violated when police 
questioned him for 8 hours without a lawyer present gillie also 
ruled that boots taken from johnston during the interrogation could 
not be used as evidence 
some residents were reluctant to talk about the case friday one 
woman who refused to give her name told a reporter to get out of 
town why wont you people leave us alone go home just leave it 
lie she said 
but jerry brown sitting on a downtown park bench was quick to 
respond 
i dont think the mans guilty he said im glad hes 
getting out a lot of people around here think hes innocent but 
they just arent brave enough to say so 
seated next to brown kenneth huffine shook his head i dont 
know who did it but i think dale johnston knows who did it he 
said 
shopkeeper marian sinsel said she was surprised at johnstons 
release 
well probably never know if hes guilty or not but i do know 
that i wouldnt open my home to him she said 
mrs schultz finds no fault with the authorities but hopes new 
evidence is found that will send johnston back to jail for good 
i know todd would tell me just let it go forget it mom 
im happy now theres nothing more you can do can i live with 
that i dont want to but i guess i have to 
my daughter still dreams about todd she always has the same 
dream that shes with some friends by a creek and suddenly the 
water starts to rise 
she and her friends try to run away but she trips over a boy 
that has fallen when she turns the boy over its todd she asks 
him what hes doing there and he tells her im allowed to come 
back every once in a while and tell you im ok 
thats what keeps me going that hes ok and nothing else bad 
will ever happen to him

the roh government which they said has lost public confidence 
we have no hope for this government which favors only the 
rich dissident leader paek kiwan shouted

vehemently criticized the roh government the spectators also 
shouted support for appeals by the speakers for the disbanding of 
the new governing party created by the merger of three political 
parties early this year the speakers said the merger which gave 
roh a parliamentary majority would lead to a dictatorship 
it was not immediately clear why the rally was allowed to take 
place

economic failures that have caused inflation and pushed up land and 
housing prices

far rightwing white leaders on 
saturday warned that south africa is heading for a holy war and 
their uniformed followers mounted their first display of military 
training 
eugene terreblanche head of the afrikaner resistance movement 
said whites would have to defend themsleves against the african 
national congress the main black nationalist group he said anc 
leader nelson mandela was trying to impose communist rule on south 
africa 
we are sure were heading for a black revolution and we will 
meet it terreblanche said it will be a holy war 
we are preparing ourselves to meet the revolution that mr 
mandelas killers will start he said 
terreblanche claims his movement known by its afrikaans 
initials as awb is forming military units or commandos around 
south africa to oppose any black government officers from 
units across south africa would receive training saturday he said 
about 300 awb members most dressed in nazistyle uniforms put 
on a show of military training at a farm outside ventersdorp it 
was the first time the awb had displayed its military capabilities 
in such a way 
men marched in squads to the bark of drill instructors and 
women in khaki uniforms practiced with pistols and shotguns at a 
firing range the men also formed riot squads practicing 
dispersing opponents with truncheons 
many families attended the meeting with mothers holding babies 
young children some dressed in awb uniforms imitated the adults 
the awbs red white and black flags bearing swastikalike 
symbols adorned the area 
if there are not enough soldiers and police to defend us we 
will defend ourselves we will become the policemen and soldiers 
and no force on earth can stop us defending ourselves 
terreblanche told his cheering supporters 
but terreblanche declined to say how many members the awb has or 
estimate its military strength 
the awb members were heavily armed but most removed their guns 
before journalists arrived 
the government and anc have expressed concern about the awb and 
other extremist groups that have been arming themselves some 
government ministers have demanded action against the groups 
asked about this terreblanche said no one can stop me when 
im preparing to defend myself the government started it 
president fw de klerk legalized the anc in february to clear 
the way for talks on ending whiteminority rule and sharing 
political power with the 28million black majority 
terreblanche and other leaders denounced de klerk as a traitor 
claiming he was selling out the 5 million whites to the anc they 
demanded an election claiming white voters would oust de klerk 
jaap marais another extremist leader told the meeting i say 
to the government that if you are going to sell out the whites to 
the blacks in this unjust way we are going to fight for what is 
rightfully ours he said 
the awb is thought to have a few thousand members at most but 
because it is armed some government officials are concerned it and 
similar groups could pose a threat to political stability 
terreblanche said the awb seeks a separate state for boers 
whites of mostly dutch ancestry he denied he was a racist saying 
blacks should live in their own separate states 
he repeatedly asserted that mandela and the anc were communists 
seeking to confiscate white property and impose black rule they 
are a bunch of communist murderers he said 
afrikaners are about 3 million of the countrys whites and are 
generally more conservative than south african whites of british 
descent 
also saturday police reported that a black youth and woman were 
burned to death a black policeman was stoned and two other black 
youths were shot in township political violence across the country 
they gave few details about the incidents which occurred friday

more than 500 wouldbe lawyers who took 
the grueling state bar examination feb 28 and march 1 will have to 
go through a few more weeks of nailbiting 
the good news is an error made in grading was caught before 
inaccurate grades were released the bad news is that 527 very 
anxious people who were expecting to find out their scores may 18 
will have to wait until june 8 
were not very happy about it believe me said r david 
stamm director of the state bar examining committee 
delay in releasing the grades will delay the bar associations 
swearingin ceremonies usually scheduled about three weeks after 
the grades are posted it also could affect some jobs in cases in 
which law firms dont want to wait three more weeks to fill slots 
requiring membership in the bar 
the grading error was made by one of 24 graders who used a 
different system in converting points it resulted in 259 
examinations each receiving one extra point and that had a domino 
effect in determining average scores and hence the grading of all 
the exams stamm said

east german authorities have spared former 
hardline communist leader erich honecker from prosecution on 
corruption charges because of his rapidly failing health a top 
official said in an interview saturday 
we had 40 years of injustice in the gdr interior minister 
petermichael diestel told the west german newspaper welt am 
sonntag we dont want to build up democracy with yet another 
injustice 
also saturday the hamburgbased newsmagazine der spiegel said 
the soviet union was preparing a peace treaty it wants signed by 
germany and its former world war ii enemies including the allied 
powers 
honecker 77 ruled east germany with absolute power for 18 
years before he was ousted in the peaceful revolution in october 
he since has become a main target of public resentment of the 
hardline communists who controlled every facet of life 
late last year the caretaker communist government that ruled 
until elections in march announced it would indict honecker on 
charges of high treason which carries a life sentence authorities 
later reduced the planned charges to corruption and abuse of office 
honecker was arrested jan 29 freed the following day and sent 
to live with a lutheran pastor and his wife in the town of lobetal 
he is suffering from kidney cancer and is staying in a soviet 
military hospital in the town of beelitz 
i simply have to acknowledge that a seriously ill 
77yearold physically fragile man cannot be prosecuted welt am 
sonntag quoted interior minister diestel as saying such a thing 
is not possible in the federal republic west germany and we 
cant have it either 
this is for us an unfortunate legal situation which we will 
somehow have to accept he said 
the east german official also was quoted as saying there is a 
good chance that corruption charges against former secret police 
chief erich mielke also will be dropped mielke now 82 headed the 
oncedreaded stasi 
diestel who also is the countrys deputy prime minister said 
he would not consider prosecuting mielke simply as a means of 
appeasing the peoples anger 
after the fall of the hardliners the selfprofessed reform 
communists fanned public outrage with nonstop revelations of 
alleged corruption by honecker and his cronies 
they included allegations that the ousted leaders stashed tens 
of millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts and lived 
luxuriously 
however the leaders elected in march in east germanys first 
free balloting have been less interested in feeding public 
resentment about the past than in preparing for unification with 
the west 
members of the east german government are divided over how 
unification should be accomplished and the west german newspaper 
bild am sonntag reported that the social democrats might withdraw 
from the coalition government 
it quoted the partys executive manager stephen hilsberg in an 
interview that was to appear in sundays editions 
they are dissatisfied with the negotiations with the west and 
want more social guarantees and limits on price increases to ease 
the transition from a socialist system where food employment and 
housing are heavily subsidized 
more than 5000 leftists in the west german city of frankfurt 
staged a noisy march to protest german unification saying bonns 
plans would amount to annexation of the east officials 
reported several scuffles with police and said at least six 
demonstrators were taken into custody 
a peace treaty between germany and its former enemies would be a 
major step on the path to a united fully sovereign germany and is 
especially important for the future of berlin 
the allied powers france britain the united states and the 
soviet union will have final say on what happens to berlin which 
after the war was divided into sectors overseen by the victors a 
peace treaty would abolish what in effect is an occupation nearly a 
half century after the end of the fighting 
citing soviet sources der spiegel magazine said a peace treaty 
would be signed by germany and anywhere from 12 to 16 of its 
onetime enemies 
the spiegel report is to appear in editions of the magazine that 
go on sale on monday it was sent in advance to other news 
organizations

foresters say it will be decades before 
more than 6000 acres of charred northern michigan woodland looks 
whole again after a fire that destroyed half the habitat of an 
endangered species of song bird 
someones brush fire ignited the northern woods of michigans 
lower peninsula on tuesday the forest was tinder dry after two 
years of drought and not yet green despite the early spring 
a hot afternoon wind whipped the fire into a wall of flames that 
advanced so fast leaping roads fire breaks and even the au sable 
river that the crawford county sheriff evacuated the town of 
lovells more than 15 miles away 
in six hours the fire was halfway to lovells 
during the night the rain did what every available firefighter 
in northern michigan couldnt do and put out the flames but by 
then the fire had destroyed 86 homes 130 other buildings and 12 
square miles of woodland 
it also consumed half of the nesting ground left for the worlds 
last 400 kirtlands warblers 
it will be half a century before the pine forests are whole 
again said bill mahalak the department of natural resources area 
forest manager 
this week the dnr will set out plans to cut down most of the 
firekilled timber so it doesnt incubate a plague of blight or 
bark beetles then the state will begin replanting 
jack pines are already reseeding themselves within hours after 
the fire cones triggered by the heat began dropping their seeds to 
the ashen ground 
it is the only way a jack pine tree germinates and it is the 
only way the tiny yellowbreasted kirtlands warbler survives 
since it will nest only on the ground beneath young jack pine trees 
if the birds can survive another decade this fire will have 
opened a vast new nesting range for them 
but mahalak was uneasy about such things 
i dont consider this fire in any way a positive thing he 
said generally theres nothing positive to anything that comes 
at such a high cost 
the fire will even affect some trout fishermen 
flames lapped right to the waters edge for a mile along the au 
sable river and trout unlimited will put up signs asking canoeists 
and fishermen not to tread on the injured ground 
some homes survived in chance islands of green 
bruce murrays mobile home still stood and along with it 
survived three evergreen bushes one nylon windsock one red 
rooster and one singed cat 
the fire took everything else 
his apple trees were black stubs his raspberry bushes were 
turned to ash his wifes 100 rabbits were cremated in their cages 
its all dusted murray said friday in disgust wading 
through an ash pile that used to be his barn kicking cinder chunks 
out of his way it makes you so sick you want to leave 
this is like a war zone 
at the end of murrays driveway hung a sign bunnies for 
sale 
beneath it he wrote extra crispy 
well you got to keep a sense of humor some way he said

the foreign minister saturday urged the united 
states to veto a united nations resolution being drafted that would 
oppose the settlement of soviet jews in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
the minister moshe arens said israel was disappointed that 
us officials appear to be cooperating with arab nations in 
drafting the resolution 
in another development saturday palestinians and israelis 
joined hands near the closed gates of a university campus in 
bethlehem to protest the closing of arab universities in the 
occupied territories 
for several weeks the 15member un security council has been 
negotiating the draft resolution which also endorses the right of 
palestinian exiles to return to their homeland and calls israels 
settlements in the occupied territories illegal and a threat to 
regional peace and security 
the united states views such settlements as an obstacle to 
middle east peace but reportedly wants to water down the 
resolution 
about 50000 soviet jews have arrived in israel so far this 
year and the government expects up to 150000 by the end of the 
year israel says it has no policy on settling the immigrants in 
the occupied territories and so far only about 200 have settled 
there according to immigration officials 
the arab nations fear that israel will encourage the immigrants 
to settle in the occupied lands to give the government a stronger 
hold on the areas 
arab sources close to resolution negotiations said friday that 
arab states are seeking us agreement on a new draft that focuses 
only on settlements and sets aside larger political issues 
arens said the american stand on the resolution is a source of 
disappointment for us he said he hopes the united states rejects 
the draft opposing the settlement of soviet jews in the occupied 
territories or vetoes the resolution during the planned un 
security council vote 
we were surprised and disappointed to see that the american 
delegate at the un security council had been working together 
with none other than the delegate of the democratic peoples 
republic of yemen the country which i believe until recently was 
on the state departments list of countries engaged in terrorism 
arens said their delegate had been working together with the 
american delegate in putting together the draft he said on 
israel radio 
in addition to the handholding protest in bethlehem 100 people 
conducted a symbolic class near the campus of bethlehem university 
listening to lectures by israeli and palestinian academics 
we came here to engage in a symbolic act of teaching that 
cannot go on in this building and many other educational 
institutions in the west bank said avi temkin a tel aviv 
university political science lecturer as a jew im ashamed of 
the fact that we are preventing young people from studying 
we want to tell the israeli public and the academic community 
in particular that time has come to break the silence said 
temkin who is also a senior official within the leftist citizens 
rights movement 
participants in the rally included members of temkins group and 
other israeli leftwing organizations as well as palestinian 
teachers and activists 
israeli authorities shut all six palestinian universities for 
security reasons shortly after the revolt against israeli 
occupation began in the west bank and the gaza strip 29 months ago 
the army views these universities as centers of unrest

touched by a childless woman who thought her life 
was worthless after she heard a mothers day sermon a minister 
will devote this years sermon to women without children 
my attitudes have changed towards the traditional mothers day 
sermon that talks about how wonderful it is for every woman to have 
children its depressing for those that cant said minister 
gerald krick pastor of the first unitarian church in suburban 
newton 
krick said women who do not bear children often feel like 
outsiders and their assumed inadequacy stands out like a missing 
leg 
it is common for womens parents and friends to expect them to 
give birth said krick a clergyman for 30 years 
i think they should also have the right to choose and yet 
tremendous pressure is brought upon women to bear children he 
said 
krick saw firsthand how women can feel burdened by this 
pressure several years ago a woman went to kricks office after 
his mothers day service 
she was in tears she and her husband were very upset about 
not having children krick recounted they were an older couple 
and were not able to adopt either 
she said that she often thought about whether her life was 
worth living without being able to have children 
krick announced last week that he would deliver a nonmothers 
day sermon and received a positive response from his congregation 
of more than 450 members 
many women feel that they would not be good mothers he 
said the result is unwanted children and mistreated children 
that leads to delinquents and a worse society 
most members of the unitarian church are concerned with 
environmental issues and see overpopulation as a world threat 
krick said 
krick 56 is married and has two daughters ages 7 and 22 
he said his wife had some misgivings about the nonmothers day 
service but she began to realize what i was trying to accomplish 
that motherhood is great but it ought to be a choice 
krick said he thinks the recognition and acceptance of 
nonmothers day may gain popularity 
theres an awful lot of childless women and men who support 
them he said

officials said the storm was stronger than a 1977 cyclone that 
left 10000 people dead but the death toll was kept relatively low 
by an early satellite warning and fast evacuation of 150000 people

the nations military leaders open 
negotiations this week with defense secretary dick cheney on 
pareddown spending proposals that by 1997 would cut six divisions 
from the army slash dozens of warships and defer missile programs 
pentagon sources said saturday 
the spending plans which were drafted by the civilian and 
military chiefs for the army navy and air force were formally 
submitted to cheneys office on may 1 
there are no surprises here said one source who noted that 
the proposals which cover the years 199297 are far from being 
finalized its a submission the final decisions are up to 
cheney up to the president 
all of the officials who spoke of the plans did so on condition 
of anonymity given that the plans are considered classified the 
washington post and the new york times first disclosed details of 
the documents in their saturday editions 
the chiefs suggestions came as capitol hill is putting great 
pressure on cheney to clarify the pentagons longrange spending 
goals in this time of reduced superpower tensions and reduced 
chance of a major land war in europe 
lawmakers complain they cant debate president bushs 303 
billion budget submission for fiscal 1991 without this guidance 
some want to slash 15 billion to 20 billion from the singleyear 
spending plan while senate armed services committee chairman sam 
nunn dga has set his limit at 298 billion a number that makes 
sharply reduced pentagon spending a near certainty 
following a formal presentation on strategy monday by gen colin 
powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff each of the 
services will present their arguments about their recommendations 
to cheney over a period of several days another source said 
the secretary must make the final decisions about the proposals 
sometime this summer as part of the pentagons complex budget 
process bush will submit his 1992 budget to congress next january 
cheney has ordered the service chiefs to cut spending by 2 
percent below the rate of inflation in each year from 1992 to 1997 
and in that light the plans are supposed to be the first thorough 
review of the militarys longterm needs 
they are now in the secretarys hands and now the real debate 
begins said one pentagon source 
many of the proposals have been reported in recent weeks as the 
service chiefs debated their options the pentagon sources said the 
major points include 
reducing active duty army forces by six divisions which would 
cut the active duty force to 580000 from 764000 
paring the armys reserve force from the current 776000 to 
645000 
slashing the navys ship strength from 542 to 488 
cutting carrier battle groups from 14 to 12 while seeking a 
new aircraft carrier in 1996 
stopping trident submarine production with the 18th ship but 
with an option to build more in the future 
vice adm daniel l cooper the services top submarine officer 
told congress in march the navy initially wanted 24 submarines to 
be built one a year at a cost of about 12 billion each the navy 
also has considered stretching out production to boat every other 
year which would result in 21 ships built 
paring 50000 activeduty navy slots and around 40000 air 
force active duty personnel 
slashing nearly in half the air forces b2 stealth bomber 
program from 132 to 75 
putting off deployment of the mx rail garrison and the 
development of the midgetman singlewarhead missile 
retiring the 200 minuteman ii intercontinental ballistic 
missiles 
even though the chiefs have been forced to suggest the cuts 
that doesnt mean they are happy with them or want to see them 
finalized several sources said 
despite the suggestion that the navys carrier fleet could be 
reduced navy secretary lawrence garrett iii still intends to argue 
for 14 carrier battle groups one source said 
cooper wants at least 21 trident submarines garrett wants 
14 carriers the source said 
the official said the navy wants an option to readjust its 
program so that it could switch funds around and buy back ships 
in the future if world events sour the source said

pope john paul ii sure of his direction 
strong in his faith has thrust the church into moral and political 
controversy in countries as diverse as the united states and 
nicaragua 
he could do no different on his eightday tour of mexico roman 
catholicisms largest spanishspeaking nation 
for starters the visit outlined in flashing neon one of 
mexicos most delicious contradictions a country 90 percent 
catholic a constitution that forbids the church to own property 
educate children or peep about politics 
the pope violated the constitution just by appearing in public 
in clerical garb not to mention saying mass for 500000 people 
dressed in a golden chasuble on national television 
the church was quick to say the vast crowds served as a virtual 
plebiscite on the binding element the notorious article 130 
only albania has a constitution like that said javier 
navarro in charge of the vatican office for latin america and 
spain 
but the dance between church and state in mexico is more 
complicated than the lambada the church bet on conservatives in 
the mexican revolution of 1910 when liberals won they took 
revenge on their reactionary foe 
although its public role was circumscribed the church retained 
much of its strength the motto of the papal visit is mexico 
always faithful 
breaches of the constitution have been winked at for decades 
politicians send their children to catholicrun schools even 
universities because they are better than public schools 
the popes visit proves that the problem with article 130 of 
the constitution is not how to change it but how impossible it is 
to enforce columnist gaston garcia cantu wrote in excelsior an 
influential newspaper 
president carlos salinas de gortari has been winking hard he 
took office on dec 1 1988 with the weakest mandate an 
institutional revolutionary party president ever had his party was 
accused of fraud there was violence in the streets on inauguration 
day 
but salinas surprised his opponents by locating a new 
constituency he invited roman catholic prelates to his 
inauguration and hinted that the relationship between church and 
state should be brought in line with reality 
he sent a personal envoy to the vatican establishing diplomatic 
relations of a kind for the first time since 1926 salinas greeted 
john paul when he arrived and had the pope to morning coffee the 
presidents office provided security and press arrangements for the 
visit including an extra plane 
the church sniffing the carrot of increased recognition has 
been grateful i pray every day for president salinas said 
monsignor genaro alamilla spokesman for the mexican church 
salinas opponents know it doesnt pay to attack the pope and 
the government has ruled out real constitutional change so they 
pick around the edges the pope is talking politics they say the 
government of a poor nation is spending too much on showtime for 
the pope 
we welcome this distinguished visitor the spiritual guide to 
millions of mexicans said cuauhtemoc cardenas runnerup to 
salinas in 1988 but the government made it into politics 
but if the pope allowed himself to be used politically he got 
plenty back again and again he addressed controversial issues 
always pleading the churchs cause 
he demanded the freedom to provide education to the faithful a 
role that would expand greatly if it were free of restrictions 
he attacked contraception in a country with a rising population 
of 85 million that suffers all the third world problems of poverty 
and malnutrition and where family planning is government policy 
he attacked materialism and greed before mexicos richest 
businessmen but in monterrey found himself giving a homily flanked 
by enormous carta blanca beer signs 
he linked capitalist culture with contraception and abortion 
saying material lust makes people want to limit their families 
he visited the indian communities of southeastern mexico in an 
effort to fend off protestant evangelicals who are learning the 
native languages and converting the poor the homeless and those 
who lost their native culture to encroaching progress 
i think his visit could help revitalize the faith here said 
benjamin cruz a 51yearold psychiatrist among a throng of 200000 
at villahermosa catholics here are disoriented its sad to 
see 
it was almost forgotten amid the political wavelets but to most 
in the crowd the popes role was to focus shared faith hundreds 
of thousands gathered to sing to listen to catch a glimpse 
when he leaped off an isolated podium and charged through a 
fence to mix with murderers and drug traffickers in a prison yard 
a prison chorus broke into beethovens ode to joy 
municipal officials engaged in a game of oneupmanship over who 
gave the best reception some mexico city authorities claimed a 
questionable 8 million to 10 million people lined the ninemile 
parade to the basilica of guadalupe there were more like 250000 
in aguascalientes the city fathers were told the pope would 
stop at the airport but wouldnt come into town so they built 
giant replicas of their finest buildings on the tarmac they 
claimed a crowd of 700000 more mathematical minds calculated 
50000 tops 
but whatever the crowd the pope gave something back in a 
thousand ways john paul provided an experience people will recount 
for years 
in tuxtla gutierrez he sparkled with jokes about his trouble 
pronouncing indian languages 
in durango squads of bicyclists chased a waving bemused figure 
in the popemobile for miles 
in mexico city 1500 people outside his bedroom fell suddenly 
silent when he told them he loved their singing but wanted to sleep 
for us it is the ultimate to come here said aurora hinojosa 
casillas who rode 225 miles by bus from ciudad juarez to 
chihuahua since i was born ive been a catholic and its 
important he is closer to god

move still stands for fear on philadelphias 
osage avenue a street of row houses sprayed with bullets five 
years ago and then destroyed by fire as police tried to rid the 
neighborhood of the radical group 
the city has rebuilt the 61 homes that burned down by a fire 
that started when police dropped a bomb on a house occupied by 
heavily armed move members on may 13 1985 an adult and a child 
escaped the house eleven others including five children and 
founder john africa died 
but residents are afraid move will resurface 
police detective edward tenuto said saturday that police dont 
know how many move members there are in the city fifteen are in 
jail one is the adult survivor of the bombing and the rest were 
convicted on unrelated charges 
along with fear the residents are puzzled that no city or 
police officials were charged in the incident sen arlen specter 
tried unsuccessfully last week to get a federal grand jury to 
reopen the case before the statute of limitations on civil rights 
violations expired at midnight saturday 
a memorial service was held friday night for the victims and 
panel discussions and workshops on public policy and human 
relations were running all day saturday 
gerald renfrow who lives across the street from where the move 
house once stood serves as spokesman for his neighbors on osage 
avenue who are afraid to talk to reporters 
im the block captain here ill answer your questions said 
renfrow 
although some considered leaving this workingclass neighborhood 
after the fire destroyed their homes the majority of the estimated 
270 displaced residents eventually moved into the 130000plus 
homes rebuilt by the city 
but nobody has moved into the new home built where the move 
house once stood it is empty guarded by police around the clock 
steel bars protecting its windows and doors 
louise james a move sympathizer who owned the original house 
has fought the city for the new dwelling 
the city gave her 2280 in 1987 saying that was what the 
property was worth when it was condemned in 1988 she sued the 
city claiming title to the new house and 375000 in damages but 
a federal judge dismissed it saying the statute of limitations for 
such a suit had expired 
on several occasions ms james the sister of move founder john 
africa and sympathizers have paraded through the neighborhood 
decrying the citys action against the group 
we are at the mercy of louise james and the city renfrow 
said we urge the city to settle with her 
tourists and reporters are also upsetting renfrow said they 
come on buses limousines taxis even helicopters fly low over 
this area we get a lot of crackpots shouting at us 
the 61 new red brick row houses clash with the older uniform 
colonialrevival row houses they too have brought troubles 
the new houses are smaller inside have less yard space and no 
enclosed porches the first winter 37 leaking roofs had to be 
repaired renfrow also cited problems with wood siding splitting 
and nails buckling 
residents had to fight off an effort by the city to triple the 
real estate taxes from about 400 to 1200 
we hear all the time from people you got a new house you 
ought to be happy and satisfied you should just shut up 
renfrow said the general public doesnt know what were going 
through 
what outsiders also fail to understand renfrow said is that 
osage residents problems didnt start with the fire they have 
been under duress since before 1982 when they first met with city 
officials to complain about the garbage and excrement surrounding 
the move house and about the nightly barrage of insults and even 
death threats the move members broadcast through bullhorns 
move whose initials dont stand for anything began in the 70s 
protesting peacefully against abuse of animals the elderly and the 
environment its surviving members say but followers became more 
militant and began having scrapes with the law and in 1978 a 
police officer was slain while attempting to evict move from a 
house 
in the osage avenue confrontation the city tried negotiation 
before force 
may 13 began with a demand from police to evacuate the move 
house a barrage of bullets followed firefighters tried 
unsuccessfully to clear a fortified bunker on the roof with water 
canons the bitterly disputed decision was made to drop a bomb 
we asked that they be evicted we did not ask for them to be 
killed said renfrow 
a county grand jury was convened and brought no charges against 
mayor w wilson goode but found him grossly negligent in 
handling the situation 
the mayor has said less each year about the move disaster and 
this year declined to be interviewed by the associated press 
im still very much troubled by what happened goode told 
the philadelphia inquirer in an interview in sundays editions i 
continue to grieve for those who lost their lives and those who 
lost their homes

beiruts neighborhoods of ashrafiyeh and baabda in villages in the 
highlands of kesrouan and pinewoods of the metn mountains 
northeast of the capital 
radio stations broadcast urgent appeals for civil defense 
workers to put out the fires and evacuate the wounded to hospitals

estonia latvia and lithuania on 
saturday forged a united front they hope will crack moscows 
resistance to their attempts to break away from the soviet union 
at a baltic summit the presidents of the three republics 
revived a 1934 political alliance and said they intend to hold 
negotiations on independence with the kremlin they also asked 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush to put 
their cause on the agenda of the superpower meeting in washington 
later this month 
the appeal by all three republics for independence negotiations 
represented a new tactic to bring the kremlin to the bargaining 
table soviet leaders have refused separate talks 
presidents vytautas landsbergis of lithuania arnold ruutel of 
estonia and anatoly gorbunov of latvia also asked for their 
republics to have full membership in the united nations and to join 
the helsinki peace process 
now we are creating a united front against the kremlins 
economic and military pressure which threatens not only lithuania 
but all three baltic countries said landsbergis whose republic 
has suffered under an embargo of oil natural gas and other 
resources for its proindependence laws 
the presidents signed four documents one on political 
cooperation a letter to gorbachev a letter to bush and a joint 
statement 
speaking at a news conference in the estonian supreme soviet 
chambers after the summit landsbergis cited a lithuanian proverb 
that one drop of water cannot break a stone but many drops can 
this joint drop of water is really important he said 
ruutel disclosed that he received a telegram saturday from 
gorbachev that said the federation council a group of advisers to 
the soviet leader proposed to give all the soviet republics 
greater autonomy 
ruutel said he has had similar offers from gorbachev before and 
this does not meet the aspiration of the estonian nation 
gorbunov said gorbachev still has not responded to latvias 
declaration of independence adopted may 4 
in the letter to gorbachev the presidents asked him to restore 
their independence 
realization of universally recognized norms of international 
rights including in relation to the three baltic governments 
former full members of the league of nations would create good 
preconditions for strengthening peace disarmament and development 
of cooperation in all of europe a draft version of the document 
says 
ruutel told reporters the presidents would like to meet jointly 
with gorbachev but that each republic has its own problems and 
could also negotiate separately with moscow such an approach 
could break the deadlock on the baltic issue ruutel said 
before the 4hour summit meeting ruutel stressed the need for 
cooperation among the baltic republics which together have a 
population of only 8 million people 
we must give a hand to one another these little nations of 
estonia lithuania and latvia because in history during a 
difficult period we always helped one another ruutel told 
reporters gathered in toompea palace an 18th century 
pinkandwhite building on a hill overlooking old tallinn 
estonias seaside capital 
gorbachev will travel to the washington at the end of this month 
for a summit with bush the baltic republics drive for 
independence is expected to be a topic there as well at a meeting 
between us secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in moscow this week 
the baltic presidents signed a document titled the declaration 
on unity and cooperation of the lithuanian republic latvian 
republic and estonian republic which reestablishes the council 
of baltic states the councils purpose will be to work toward 
the full restoration of governmental independence of the three 
republics 
the declaration also said the presidents and other top officials 
of the republics will meet regularly as part of the council and 
will make nonbinding recommendations on the governments 
the document was printed in five languages estonian latvian 
lithuanian russian and english 
the leaders of the republics want to have seats in the united 
nations and be included in the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe that produced the helsinki accords in 1975 
they also want to be invited to a followup helsinki meeting 
proposed for paris this year 
baltic state representatives set up the council of baltic states 
in september 1934 in geneva under an agreement of unity and 
cooperation a 1971 soviet history book said the alliance became 
a hotbed of antisoviet agitation 
the republics were part of the russian empire but gained their 
independence amid the turmoil of world war i and the bolshevik 
revolution they were absorbed by josef stalin in 1940 as 
confrontation between the soviet union and nazi germany loomed at 
the start of world war ii 
lithuania declared outright on march 11 that it was 
reestablishing that independence and latvia and estonia followed 
with declarations that they would resume independence after 
unspecified transition periods 
gorbachev has demanded the republics observe soviet law 
however and one requires a referendum and a waiting period of up 
to five years before secession 
landsbergis was quoted saturday as saying that up to 300000 
people soon will be unemployed if moscow continues its economic 
blockade against the republic of 38 million people

teenagers who admitted punching marchers in 
last weeks march of dimes fundraising walkathon say they were 
holding a contest to see who could land the best punch on a 
participant police said 
the winner was supposedly to have received a cardboard replica 
of a prizefighters championship belt police said friday 
members of the group of seven to 10 teenagers have been linked 
to attacks on at least 11 walkers at the may 6 charity event the 
police said 
the only person charged so far is an 18yearold man accused of 
knocking out the front teeth of a 15yearold marcher police said 
at least two teenagers admitted participating in the attacks and 
implicated others in the gang of 16 to 19yearolds 
the problem is trying to match the victims with the 
assailants said police sgt richard w barger originally we 
only had three assaults reported to us now we have 11 and possibly 
several more since they struck and ran it is difficult to 
determine who did what 
the assaults apparently began about 1 pm and continued for 
much of the afternoon police questioned some suspects and were 
told that the gang had staged a contest to see who could hit a 
walker the hardest 
barger said the group claimed to have been holding the contest 
during the march of dimes walkathon for two or three years and that 
the attacks came to the attention of the police this time only 
because of the increase in severity and frequency 
omar sharrif burrell who was arrested thursday on an assault 
charge was being held saturday in lieu of 1000 bail 
the 20th annual walkathon raised more than 11 million in 
pledges organizers said they plan to alter the 22mile route next 
year to avoid the northeast baltimore neighborhood where the

former university of arkansas 
basketball star sidney moncrief reveals in his new book that he was 
occasionally offered money by an alumnus or fan during his years as 
a razorback in the 1970s 
but the former college allamerican and nba allstar with the 
milwaukee bucks said he was not implying that the arkansas athletic 
program is tainted 
arkansas runs a straight program he said in an interview 
i cant say that during my time at arkansas i wasnt offered 
anything extra moncrief wrote the book moncrief my journey 
to the nba was written with myra mclarey he retired from the 
nba last year

didnt walk up to me after a game and put a hundreddollar bill in 
my hand when he shook it he wrote 
he does not say whether he took the money

there were problems in the ua athletic program

kerry and kyle beaver are identical 
twins but this is getting ridiculous 
they earned identical grade point averages 396 out of a 
possible 40 at penn state in fact their only b came in the 
same english class 
because of their top grades the 22yearold students from 
bloomsburg won the right to lead their fellow industrial 
engineering graduates as student marshals at commencement 
ceremonies saturday 
the similarities between them are nothing new to family friends 
and teachers some pals call both of them beav to avoid getting 
them mixed up 
there were early attempts to channel the twins along separate 
paths so they could develop their own interests said their mother 
jackie starr 
we tried in a way they even recommended that in elementary 
school but they just came together whatever we did she said 
theyd end up with the same grades on the test or the same 
answers wrong 
as penn state freshmen they were ordered to sit apart after an 
economics teacher suspected them of cheating when they both missed 
the same question on the first test winding up with identical 
scores of 96 they then both got 100s on the next two tests they 
said 
the two say their close relationship helps them academically 
because engineering classes require group projects and they work 
well together 
studying together helps a lot because if one of us cant 
figure it out the other can kyle said 
the only class at penn state they didnt take together was 
speech because each gets butterflies when the other gets up to 
give a speech 
despite their similarities they also have differences kyle is 
righthanded kerry is lefthanded kyle likes vanilla kerry likes 
chocolate kyle describes himself as lazier than kerry he needs 
his brother for competition to keep his grades high he said

thousands of chinese nationwide bent their heads 
over a 30page examination booklet saturday for a test many hoped 
would be the first step toward going abroad to study 
about 15000 people took the test opened at 47 test centers from 
coastal shanghai to kunming in western china from northern harbin 
to southern canton 
the test of english as a foreign language is required of 
foreign students applying to us universities some schools in 
canada and europe also ask for the test scores to measure a foreign 
students proficiency in english 
students say that since last years military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement most are studying english in the hopes of 
going overseas 
but apparently not all are confident enough to take the test 
yet chinese officials say the number of testtakers has not 
increased noticeably 
about 400 students took the exam saturday at the beijing foreign 
languages institute 
im so testedout im dizzy said one 20yearold man as he 
left the exam room 
the 2hour exam tests writing ability reading and listening 
comprehension and grammar out of a possible 800 points most 
american universities want a 575point minimum for admission and a 
higher score for a scholarship 
the exam was first administered in china in 1981 to just 600 
people at three test sites it now is given four times a year last 
year about 40000 chinese took the test 
students pay the equivalent of a months salary to take the exam 
and of those who can pay not everyone can take the exam last 
year china began requiring a letter of approval from each persons 
work unit or univeristy communist party secretary before 
registering for the test 
students at some test centers have complained of rampant 
cheating ignored by proctors who sympathize with the students 
desire to leave china and want to help them out 
but both the educational testing service in princeton nj 
which administers the exam and the china international 
examinations coordination bureau which supervises the test in 
china say cheating is not a problem 
the us embassy in beijing says last year it granted 6301 
study visas 
china has said it will send 3000 students abroad in 1990 but 
has placed new restrictions on studying at foreign universities 
they include requiring students without scholarships to work five 
years before going overseas 
the measures were apparently prompted by fears students would 
not return especially after the june 1989 military crackdown on 
student protesters in which hundreds perhaps thousands died 
authorities are clearly concerned about students being exposed 
abroad to ideas and lifestyles that might make them rebellious or 
inclined not to return 
in the past 12 years china has sent between 60000 and 80000 
students to foreign countries but nearly half have failed to 
return more than 20000 chinese students have gone overseas on 
their own and many stayed abroad

cities

death on sunday during which shop owners will lower their 
shutters and drivers will stop their vehicles said mayor

the sandinista daily newspaper on 
saturday accused president violeta barrios de chamorro of violating 
the constitution by reviewing laws passed during the sandinistas 
last two months in office 
mrs chamorro who ended a decade of leftist sandinista rule 
when she took office april 25 announced the review friday as about 
60000 government workers staged sitin strikes demanding 200 
percent pay raises from the new government 
there were no major rallies or marches saturday in managua 
among the laws being reviewed are an amnesty law that protects 
former sandinista government officials from prosecution for acts 
committed while they were in the government and another that 
restricts ownership of broadcast media 
another allowed senior sandinistas to confiscate homes of the 
wealthy 
the presidents move is a violation of the constitution as 
serious as a coup the sandinista daily newspaper barricada said 
it called the review of the property laws unconstitutional 
contrary to agrarian reform and repressive 
the present constitution drawn up during the sandinista years 
gives the executive branch significant powers to issue decrees in 
fiscal and administrative matters 
on friday 2000 striking workers broke through a police 
barricade and took over a plaza outside the presidential office 
the government refused to meet with the strikers and threatened to 
fire them 
government employees have rejected a 60 percent pay increase 
ordered by mrs chamorro who said her government cannot afford to 
meet the employees demands for bigger raises 
labor minister francisco rosales charged that the strike is 
being waged not for financial reasons but simply to provoke 
chaos 
on thursday mrs chamorro suspended a civil service law that 
protects employees from firing and grants them the right to strike 
and bargain collectively 
on saturday 85 employees of the information and press 
department of the presidents office returned to work said jairo 
blandon a spokesman for the workers 
workers are demanding cost of living raises to keep up with

this week doubled water rates tripled electricity rates and raised 
the rates of telephone services by 1300 percent the public 
transportation subsidy has also been removed 
the cordoba nicaraguas currency has been devalued for the 
fourth time in less than a month 
the government also has promised that a commission studying 
charges of illegal land seizures will make decisions within seven 
days only land confiscated after july 29 1979 will be considered 
for review and all claims must be made within 180 days the 
government said 
in tegucigalpa the honduran foreign ministry said saturday that 
us military helicopters will be used this week to move about 
1800 nicaraguan contra rebels and their families from the 
nicaraguan border to a unrun camp in southeast honduras 
it cited humanitarian reasons for the approval by the government 
and the united nations for the transfer to the las vegas refugee 
camp 50 miles southeast of tegucigalpa the honduran capital 
the camp already has some 10000 nicaraguan refugees and the 
government statement said the refugees will stay there until they 
return to nicaragua or go to a third country

last month for security zones within nicaragua pending their 
disarmament and demobilization which is to be completed by june 10

consequences of four decades of communist rule proposed a 
citizens democracy corps saturday to help eastern europe 
rebuild its political and legal systems

the foundations of free society in eastern europe 
the corps mandate will be to deal with requests for help in 
areas such as law business health and the environment 
it would be started with federal funds after that it would be 
expected to provide its own funding through private contributions 
the president announced the program in a commencement address at 
the university of south carolina 
before returning to the white house bush also was the 
graduation speaker at liberty university founded in lynchburg 
va by the rev jerry falwell to emphasize bible study and 
evangelism 
departing from his prepared text bush underscored his support 
for a constitutional amendment permitting school prayer in public 
schools he did not mention his advocacy of another amendment to 
ban abortion but falwell introduced bush as a politician who 
thinks adoption is a better idea than abortion 
emphasizing the need for volunteerism bush said the united 
states must use its own generosity to combat such global problems 
as hunger and health care illiteracy and homelessness 
each of you can reject membership in a me generation 
proving that yours is the we generation bush said winning 
applause from the audience 
in this more peaceful time when our armies can become 
smaller we must mold a world where the armies of people helping 
others can become biggerbush said 
with a series of five commencement addresses this month bush is 
laying the foundation for summit talks with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev beginning may 30 in washington 
in large measure the speeches have focused on changes in 
eastern europe with the collapse of communism 
poland czechoslovakia and hungary stand now in the spring of 
1990 as america stood in the summer of 1787 bush told the south 
carolina audience 
who will be their franklins their washingtons their 
hamiltons their madisons their men and women of towering genius 
the nationbuilders who will set in place the firm foundations of 
selfgovernment 
he said we can help them build political systems based on 
respect for individual freedoms for the right to speak our mind 
to live as we wish and to worship as our conscience tells us we 
must 
a statement released by the white house said the citizens 
democracy corps would mobilize and coordinate american private 
sector initiatives for eastern europe 
in particular the agency will deal with requests in the areas 
of constitutional law and parliamentary procedures 
englishlanguage training journalism public health and medical 
support banking financial services and market economics business 
law commercial practices and agriculture and environmental 
protection 
bush also announced he was authorizing the us exportimport 
bank to provide mediumterm loan guarantees and credit insurance 
for poland to purchase american machinery technology and supplies 
the new arrangement does not provide new money from washington 
but lengthens the terms for credit deals currently poland is 
eligible only for shortterm coverage over a years span the new 
mediumterm policy will provide guarantees for up to seven years 
the president said eastern europe under communism was governed 
by not the rule of law but the perversion of law rules made not 
to serve the will of the people but the whim of the party 
he said the result was a landscape of moral destruction the 
tragic consequence of four decades of communist rule a breakdown 
of trust 
fortunately the moral destruction in eastern europe was not 
complete the president said individuals somehow managed to 
maintain their inner strength their moral compass 
he said the new leaders in eastern europe have begun to build 
on the ruins of communist rule democratic systems based on trust 
the president said americans can show eastern europe the 
building blocks of a free society such as trade unions 
professional groups and political parties 
weve got to help the emerging democracies build legal systems 
that secure the procedural rights that preserve freedom and above 
all a system that supports a strict equality of rights

premier nikolai i ryzhkov went on national 
television saturday night and sought to assure workers they will be 
protected from high prices and unemployment as the soviet union 
moves toward a market economy 
the government will do everything it can including indexing 
wages to prices to ensure that there will be as mild a transition 
to a market economy as possible ryzhkov said in an interview with 
a soviet television journalist 
he stressed several times that price reform would never be 
introduced without discussing it with the people 
for these radical measures one would introduce them only with 
the peoples agreement he said adding that was the only way to 
avoid a political and social crisis 
soviet leaders have been grappling with how to introduce the 
radical reforms scheduled to go into effect this summer without 
causing public opposition and social upheaval 
officials have sought in recent weeks to emphasize that a 
polishstyle shock therapy approach to economic reform 
including a sudden freeing of prices devaluation of the currency 
and a rapid rise in unemployment was not planned ryzhkovs 
appearance on television appeared aimed at underscoring that 
the economic plan is being drafted by the presidential council 
president mikhail s gorbachevs advisory body and ryzhkov said 
it would be published in the press and debated in the supreme 
soviet legislature after may 20 
ryzhkov said steps would be taken to protect the public from a 
spurt in inflation he said the government was working on an 
indexing system to link salaries to price increases but he gave no 
specifics 
a senior gorbachev adviser alexander yakovlev said earlier 
this month that prices must rise enough to sop up an estimated 500 
billion rubles 825 billion at the official exchange rate that 
soviet citizens have stashed away because there are so few consumer 
goods to buy 
ryzhkov said the government disagrees with those who believe 
unemployment will help the process of economic development he 
emphasized that the soviet constitution guarantees the right to 
work 
ryzkhovs remarks came one day after gorbachev told workers that 
it lags behind the west in terms of productivity 
in our country two to three people are doing what in the 
west only one person is doing gorbachev told workers friday at 
the bolshevik confectionary factory

texans who live along the 550mile trinity river 
came out on the losing side of an annual gamble this year 
reservoirs were kept full of water for the hot dry summer not 
lowered for a chance of spring floods 
hundreds of angry landowners criticized the trinity river 
authority for failing to provide a safety margin in the level of 
lake livingston as water flowed downstream from record flooding in 
northern texas 
about 300 people who attended an authority meeting two weeks ago 
claim the agency could have prevented emergency heavy releases that 
will add to flooding below the dam 
i am fearful that push will come to shove on this thing 
people all up and down the river are adamant about it theyre mad 
and highly upset said liberty county judge dempsie henley 
theyre making all kinds of threats including wanting to file 
lawsuits 
but tra spokesman john jadrosich said the flooding cannot be 
controlled 
to build a lake to provide proper flood control to the lower 
trinity would be of almost unimaginable size it is doubtful you 
could do it he said 
this is a flood plain jadrosich said it will flood again 
next year it has done so since time immemorial and theres 
absolutely nothing the trinity river authority can do to provide 
relief to these poor beleaguered people downstream we are doing 
everything we can do at this point 
the discharge of water over the spillway at the lake livingston 
dam normally about 20000 cubic feet of water per second 
increased saturday as the leading edge of the flood arrived to 
48200 cubic feet per second said jim mitchum liberty county 
emergency management coordinator 
but later saturday tra officials increased that estimate to 
90000 to 100000 cfs because of rain friday night upstream and 
said a flow above 75000 cfs would be sustained for up to nine 
days jadrosich said the previous record flow over the dam built 
in 1969 was 75000 cfs in june 1973 niagara falls has a mean 
annual flow of at about 212200 cfs 
henley said a flow of 40000 cfs is enough to cover an acre of 
land one foot deep in one second 
tuesday through friday we will have the crest come in here 
and we will have a major dangerous flood the highest in the 
history of the county since the lake built henley said 
henley issued an evacuation warning urging 7000 people to 
evacuate lowlying areas below the dam 
mitchum said most people felt that although the dam is not 
intended for flood control water should have been released after 
the heavy rain in the dallasfort worth area so the reservoir would 
have had more capacity when the flood water arrived 
but jadrosich said that because lake livingston is so large 
with a surface of 90000 acres it would have taken several weeks 
to make a dent in the lake level 
and he added considering the size of the trinitys flood if 
lake livingston was completely dry like it was in 1969 it would 
fill completely up and would still produce a flood downstream 
state rep mark stiles who organized the tra meeting two weeks 
ago for his constituents said he has not been pleased with the 
authoritys attitude and compalined that tra executive director 
danny vance went on vacation at the time of the flooding 
its not his fault that it rained but i think we need to be 
devising plans to give people relief stiles said 
theres a lot of folk in the legislature that dont like the 
trinity river authority he said were going to talk about the 
way theyre operating it 
eight of the 23 artificial lakes along the trinity river 
watershed are managed by the army corps of engineers the area 
drained by the river is nearly 18000 square miles or 6 percent of 
the states total area 
ron ruffennach public affairs officer for the corps fort worth 
district said theres a tradeoff that texans must accept 
if it werent for the lakes we wouldnt have drinking 
water he said 
and he added the flood control projects that are built to 
protect people downstream can only do so much if people keep 
building in the flood plains

arms control advocates said saturday a newly 
tested missile tracking device could violate the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty if deployed as part of the star wars 
defense system 
the test does not have all the capabilities would need but it 
is clearly intended to lead to a component which could be in 
violation of the treaty said spurgeon m keeny president of the 
washingtonbased arms control association 
keeny said the sixhour test flight friday of the airborne 
optical adjunctairborne surveillance testbed stopped short of 
being a violation of the abm treaty but keeny added that the 
issue is whether the test is leading to a component which if 
successful would be in violation 
the infrared tracking device was mounted on a boeing 767 that 
took off from boeing field in seattle it is designed to track 
hundreds of targets sorting missiles from debris and decoys 
three months of flight testing over the continental united 
states will be followed by tests using air force targets at 
kwajalein atoll in the pacific 
the abm treaty bans spacebased systems designed to substitute 
for radar in an ordinary system the pact was approved on the 
theory that anytime one side in the cold war built an 
antiballistic missile system the other would find a way around it 
causing the arms race to spiral 
john pike of the washingtonbased federation of american 
scientists issued a statement saying that the airborne optical 
system performs a role similar to that of the perimiter acquisition 
radar par in the sentinelsafeguard system and that radars 
such as the par were clearly considered to be abm components and 
subjected to strict limitations in the treaty 
thus while a0a may not be able to perform all of the functions 
that an abm radar might be required to perform it nonetheless is 
capable of substituting for an abm radar and since it is airbased 
it is banned under article v of the treaty pike said 
pentagon spokesman william oconnell said however that the 
system has undergone a treaty compliance review and does not 
violate the treaty in any respect he said that it cannot scan wide 
areas of space but must be told where to look and therefore cannot 
be considered a substitute for radar 
fridays test he said was primarily to determine the effects 
of vibration on new technology that has come into being since the 
system was developed 
the device tested friday was described in seattle as the worlds 
most sophisticated longwave infrared sensor it was contained in 
an 86foot cupola mounted atop the aircraft 
keeny is a former deputy director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency the arms control association is a private 
washingtonbased group many of whose members have been arms 
control officials including former secretary of defense robert s 
mcnamara and disarmament agency director paul c warnke

the president of the southern christian 
leadership conference led a courtordered race relations seminar 
saturday for four former ku klux klansmen and said the response 
was better than hed expected 
i didnt anticipate the tremendous experience we had the 
rev joseph lowery of atlanta said after he and other sclc 
representatives met for two hours with the exklansmen in a hotel 
however one of the exklansmen roger handley of steele called 
the session a wasted two hours 
he didnt change my feelings said handley i told lowery 
he ought to take his message of brotherly love into the projects 
where there are drugs rapes and murders 
another former klansman terry tucker of cullman called the 
session a learning experience 
weve got a lot more common ground than people would think 
he said i never have hated blacks and i dont think they hate 
us 
the session was ordered last year by us district judge eb 
haltom jr as part of a settlement of a lawsuit stemming from klan 
violence against black marchers in decatur on may 26 1979 in 
which gunfire wounded two whites and two blacks 
black marchers were protesting the conviction of tommy lee 
hines a retarded black man found guilty of raping a white woman 
klansmen attacked the marchers and shots were fired wounding four 
people 
as part of the court settlement the men were ordered to leave 
the klan perform community service and pay varying fines 
lowery said he talked to the four about the oneness of the 
human family selfrespect the economics of race how all poor 
people are taken advantage of about the futility of violence and 
violent resistance to racial progress how darkness cant hold back 
the dawn 
crossburnings have been a dreaded symbol of the kkk over the 
years but lowery said he told them the cross is a symbol of our 
faith and we hope it would be used for that 
tucker finished serving a twomonth prison sentence for the 
violence in march 1989 and said hes had no contact with the klan 
since 
i feel there are different ways of going about things he 
said as for his role in the decatur melee tucker said i 
probably was just a young person sowing bad oats thats all 
another of the four attending the seminar doug berryhill of 
huntsville said it was a productive meeting and i learned quite 
a bit 
herbert campbell of tuscumbia using a newspaper to shield his 
face from news cameras was asked if he learned anything i 
learned to keep a newspaper with me he said 
handley said he would have no reservations about rejoining the 
klan 
a fifth klansman derane godfrey of wylam was ordered to attend 
the session but didnt show up elizabeth johnson a lawyer from 
the montgomerybased southern poverty law center which brought the 
lawsuit against the klan said she wasnt sure what would be done 
about godfreys absence 
lowery said that at the end of the twohour course all but one 
of those present held hands while prayers were offered he declined 
to say which one 
among the blacks at the session were lowery and his wife 
evelyn an sclc aide ralph worrell of atlanta the rev john 
nettles of gadsden alabama sclc president and the rev abraham 
woods president of the birmingham sclc chapter

a measure that would impose stiff fines or jail 
sentences for insulting or slandering the soviet president was 
approved saturday by one chamber of the soviet legislature but 
failed in the other chamber tass said the bill will now go to a 
committee to be reworked and introduced at another session the 
official soviet news agency reported 
the measure was introduced after an angry red square protest may 
1 in which thousands of people shouted or displayed slogans 
demanding the leadership resign some called president mikhail s 
gorbachev a dictator 
alexander n yakovlev a close adviser to gorbachev said the 
demonstrators had insulted kremlin leaders who left their 
reviewing stand atop lenins mausoleum after enduring about 20 
minutes of the protest 
the legislation appeared to have been brought up for debate 
hastily but it was not immediately clear whether it was directly 
connected to the protest 
there previously had been no reports that such a draft measure 
existed and as late as thursday legislative officials made no 
mention of it on the agenda 
tass said the bill to protect the honor and dignity of the 
soviet president was approved by the council of the union one 
chamber of the legislature but it failed in the other house the 
council of the nationalities 
speakers who favored the law said statements discrediting or 
insulting the head of state can help destabilize society the news 
agency said other deputies insisted that the bill contain a 
clearcut definition of what constitutes an insult 
yevgeny sorokin a spokesman for the supreme soviet or 
legislature said the bill would impose a fine of up to 5000 two 
years in a labor camp or three years in jail for slandering or 
insulting the president 
tass quoted yuri kalmykov chairman of the parliamentary 
legislation committee as saying the measure was necessary because 
the head of state needed special protection 
the bill would cover all public pronouncements containing 
critical remarks concerning the activity of the soviet president or 
a policy pursued under his leadership tass said 
under the measure an offense conducted with the help of the 
news media could be punishable by a jail term of up to six years 
tass said it said a newspaper radio or tv station carrying such 
material could be fined up to 41600 and be suspended from 
broadcasting or publishing 
the soviet parliament elected gorbachev to a new powerful 
executive presidency on march 15 
gorbachev has said he wants to use the presidency to unite the 
country but criticism of his policies and pressure from some 
republics for autonomy or outright secession have become more acute 
since gorbachev took the new post 
yakovlev said may 4 that the soviet leadership was insulted by 
the protesters in the unofficial may day protest 
i saw stalin portraits nicholas ii portraits he said 
slogans were heard that ceausescus destiny is in store for some 
people referring to romanian leader nicolae ceausescu executed 
after a summary trial dec 25 
that was really unfortunate yakovlev said anybody would 
treat these slogans as an insult

mexicos congress on saturday approved a 
constitutional amendment to allow complete private ownership of 
banks eight years after they were nationalized 
the measure now needs the approval of the senate and 31 state 
legislatures 
the 33954 vote came eight hours after the chamber of deputies 
convened early saturday to take up the issue there were 12 
abstentions

action party threw its support behind the amendment

salinas de gortari and supported by his institutional revolutionary 
party

block the reform which needed a twothirds vote to pass the 
governing party and the conservatives together have 364 of the 500 
congressional seats

has an overwhelming majority a simple majority also is needed in 
31 state legislatures

portillo following an economic downturn attributed to a fall in 
price for oil mexicos leading export 
lopez portillos successor miguel de la madrid amended the 
legislation to allow up to 34 percent private investment in banks 
under the proposal passed saturday commerical banks could be 
100 percent privately owned but some specialized development banks 
would remain in government hands

president bush on saturday signed a 
proclamation calling on china to respond positively to the 
freedom aspirations of demonstrators beijing violently suppressed a 
year ago 
bush signed a congressional proclamation naming sunday may 13 
a national day in support of human rights the proclamation asked 
americans to observe the day in the spirit of commemorating those 
who died in beijings tiananmen square at the hands of the 
chinese government 
it said people should observe the day drawing inspiration 
from the courage of those who held fast to their ideals in the face 
of violent suppression and urging the chinese government to 
respond positively to the fundamental aspirations for freedom 
expressed in last years demonstrations 
these are the same fundamental aspirations as profoundly 
expressed by people around the world during the momentous events we 
are still witnessing events that are daily advancing the cause of 
freedom and human rights 
congress passed the proclamation on friday and sent it to the 
president bush the us diplomatic representative to beijing in 
the mid1970s has been criticized for failing to take stricter 
economic and political measures to show displeasure with chinas 
repressive and violent tactics 
while bush in the past has decried chinas violence against its 
prodemocracy demonstrators he has also taken steps to renew 
normal relations with beijing following an initial cut off of all 
highlevel government contact 
he secretly sent national security adviser brent scowcroft to 
meet with the chinese two times in the summer following the 
tiananmen square massacre of demonstrators 
the proclamation notes the june 34 violent attacks on thousands 
of chinese protesters by tanks and armed forces 
this action far beyond the legitimate requirements of law and 
order resulted in the deaths of hundreds of unarmed citizens 
bushs statement said in the months that followed thousands 
more were detained and otherwise punished for their peaceful 
expression of political views 
however he stated steps have been taken in recent months 
that have resulted in some improvement 
china lifted martial law in beijing and the tibetan capital of 
lhasa announced release of hundreds of political prisoners and 
stated it would receive officially sponsored us scholars and 
peace corps volunteers the statement said 
the united states hopes that these steps will be followed by 
others that will demonstrate chinas return to the path of 
reformbush said 
in the face of criticism that he has been too soft on china the 
president maintains that china has too much geopolitical importance 
in the world to be isolated by the united states he has stated he 
is disappointed that beijing has not fully reversed its destructive 
policies but maintains it is better to continue talking to the 
chinese about these matters than to shun the worlds most populous 
nation

gov l douglas wilder urged all state 
agencies and institutions saturday to divest themselves of 
companies with interests in south africa 
wilder speaking at commencement ceremonies at norfolk state 
university said the freedom sought by blacks in south africa is 
no different from the freedom sought in east germany poland and 
lithuania our support can be no less 
wilder the nations first elected black governor chose 
predominantly black norfolk state to make the divestiture 
announcement it followed reports earlier in the week that his 
administration was quietly urging university of virginia officials 
to sell the schools holdings in companies with south african 
interests 
in addition to the university the virginia supplemental 
retirement system has 400 million to 700 million in investments 
in companies operating in south africa according to system 
officials overall the retirement system has almost 9 billion in 
assets 
wilder does not have the power to order the university or the 
retirement system to divest but the governor makes appointments to 
the trustee boards of both 
recent progress in south africa against apartheid the policy of 
keeping whites and blacks separated is a result of international 
indignation and sanctions the governor said 
if we are to participate in the extension to all people 
freedoms and liberties which we hold dear we must take concrete 
actions which reflect our support he said 
the university of virginia where students have staged protests 
in recent weeks to push for divestiture has reduced the south

prime minister margaret thatcher 
fighting to regain lost popularity pledged saturday to remain 
leader of the conservative party and predicted victory in the next 
election 
theres a lot more to do a womans work is never done she 
told flagwaving members of the scottish conservative party 
radical policies have helped us to win three general 
elections and they will win us a fourth she said 
the next election must be held by mid1992 
conservative popularity has been hit by high interest rates 
rising inflation and an unpopular new local government tax paid by 
all adults which replaces property taxes paid only by homeowners 
but mrs thatcher signaled her belief that the tide of public 
opinion which had seen the conservatives trailing the opposition 
labor party by more than 20 points was turning 
in the latest opinion polls labors lead was cut to between 11 
and 15 percent although the conservatives lost in this months 
local elections the results were not as disastrous as forecast 
if we play as a team and keep our eye on the ball we can make 
it a conservative grand slam mrs thatcher said 
the prime ministers reiteration of her plans to lead the party 
into the next election came two days after former defense secretary 
michael heseltine regarded as her main rival for the leadership 
criticized the new tax dubbed the poll tax 
he said most britons regarded the poll tax as too high unfair 
or both and it has created a lingering sense of injustice 
the prime minister never mentioned heseltine launching instead 
into an attack on the socialist labor party at the end she was 
cheered

israel television reported saturday that the 
cia condoned a plan by an israeli reserve colonel to set up a 
training camp for panamanian rebels in antigua and equip it with 
israeli weapons 
the cia declined to comment on the report which came as 
antiguan investigators were in israel to inquire about the weapons 
shipment 
the camp project was never completed and antiguan investigators 
say the israeli arms later were diverted to a colombian drug 
chieftain 
cia representatives stationed on the caribbean island did not 
oppose the training camp project the report said 
we always decline to comment on reports of this nature said 
cia spokesman peter earnest 
the fourmember antiguan investigative team was assisted by us 
experts the report said it said the team completed its inquiry 
saturday and is to report back to the antiguan government 
on tuesday the israeli foreign ministry gave the investigators 
a file of documents one signed by antiguas top defense offical 
vere bird jr it assured israel the arms would not be sent to a 
third country and would be used exclusively by the antiguan 
military 
the investigators also questioned reserve col yair klein who 
had wanted to set up the camp the report said 
the affair began when klein who runs a private security company 
called hod hahanit or spearhead approached the antiguan 
government with plans to create a military training camp according 
to the tv report 
a senior antiguan military official who was not identified 
told cia representatives on the island of the plan and they did not 
oppose it the report said 
klein told israel television the school was supposed to train 
500 fighters opposed to panamas gen manuel noriega who were 
supposed to use the weapons coming from israel but plans for 
the camp fell through the weapons were returned to the elements 
who bought them in panama he said 
noriega was toppled in the december us invasion of panama and 
was brought to the united states to face drug charges 
klein offered no explanation as to how the weapons reached 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha a drug boss killed in a raid by colombian 
police in december 
after rodriguez gachas death about 200 israelimade galil 
assault rifles were found on his ranch 
the new york times named klein and maurice sarfati an israeli 
owner of a produce business in antigua as responsible for the arms 
diversion 
colombian officials say klein is wanted for organizing training 
and equipping paramilitary groups he has been declared a fugitive 
from justice and may be tried in absentia 
klein says he provided selfdefense training to colombian 
farmers at the time of the antiguan camp project but the 
television report quoted him as saying the projects were not linked 
colombia on friday suspended a 28yearold agreement allowing 
israelis to enter the country without visas in protest over the 
smuggling of israeli weapons to cocaine traffickers

a panamanianflag vessel about 630 am saturday but two pumper 
boats a ladder truck and a firefighting team remained at the scene 
to guard against hot spots flaring up 
the fire was expected to continue smoldering for several days 
because of insulation aboard the vessel said coast guard lt

indian leaders from five south american 
nations returned to their rain forest homelands saturday after 
forming an alliance with international environmentalists to 
cooperate to save the amazon jungle 
thirteen leaders of 12 million indians living in the amazon 
river basin in colombia ecuador peru bolivia and brazil signed 
a pact late friday night with representatives of 14 international 
conservationist groups 
the agreement came after three days of meetings in this isolated 
amazon river port 715 miles northeast of lima 
the indians convened the gathering to demand a voice in 
environmentists efforts to preserve the vast amazon jungle from 
destruction 
many times conservationists see only the pretty birds the 
pretty rivers the pretty green trees evaristo nugkuag an 
aguaruna indian leader from peru said in the closing ceremony 
you forget that indians live in this jungle that we are its true 
caretakers its true protectors 
nugkuag is president of the coordinating body for indigenous 
peoples organizations of the amazon basin 
the agreement was signed by representatives of such 
organizations as greenpeace and the world wildlife fund it said 
the group recognized the importance of the indians own proposals 
for conservation of the amazon 
an estimated 50 to 100 acres of tropical rain forest is being 
cleared in the amazon every minute according to ecologists for the 
smithsonian institution 
the indians are battling to save their homelands from migrant 
farmers ranchers loggers gold prospectors oil companies and 
other groups seeking economic gain from the jungle 
lately they have also become concerned about the hundreds of 
thousands of acres of forest being destroyed to grow coca leaves 
the raw material for cocaine 
in their first meeting with environmentalists in washington in 
october they expressed growing doubts about the debtfornature 
swaps in which some of the foreign debt crippling south american 
countries is traded for a commitment to set aside rain forest lands 
as wilderness preserves 
without consulting us you have traded our land for a debt we 
did not incur nugkuag told the washington gathering 
in such arrangements conservation groups assume a portion of a 
countrys debt to foreign banks in exchange for the countrys 
setting aside land for protection 
since 1987 in latin america there have been debtfornature 
swaps in bolivia ecuador and costa rica 
the indians complain that the swaps have shown disregard for 
their rights they propose that indian tribes be given stewardship 
of their ancestral territories as part of the swaps 
no accord was reached in iquitos on the debtswap issue but the 
indian leaders and conservationists agreed to meet again in 
washington in september to pursue joint actions 
barbara bramble the head of the national wildlife federations 
international program said the environmentalists realized the 
indians are important allies in the fight to save the amazon 
were an organization dedicated to the wise use of 
resources she said the people who are doing that best are 
tribal people not north americans

interim president ion iliescu said 
saturday he expected a central square blocked for three weeks by 
antigovernment protesters would be cleaned out this week 
chances of compromise appeared to run out saturday when 
representatives of the antiiliescu rally spurned an invitation 
from iliescu to talk protesters want iliescu to resign and all 
former communists out of politics 
the demonstration in university square entered its 21st day and 
about 2000 demonstrators had gathered by nightfall they shouted 
slogans and sang songs against iliescu and his national salvation 
front 
the front is the dominant force in the interim government and is 
heavily favored to win may 20 elections when voters will choose a 
president and the first freely elected government in five decades 
a december revolution toppled and executed hardline communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu but the opposition says the front with 
many former communists including iliescu seeks to reestablish a 
totalitarian system 
on saturday iliescu repeatedly set thursday as the last day 
political rallies could be held and indicated he viewed the 
university square demonstration as such a rally 
i expect that by thursday the square should be cleaned out 
iliescu said when asked if he would order the police to clear the 
square he replied we shall see 
iliescu rejected charges the opposition was harassed during the 
campaign 
compared to what happens in other democratic countries in 
similar situations i would say it has been pretty mild he said 
i understand in italy theyve had six deaths weve only had 
threats 
in london the british foreign office said it told romania it 
was concerned about reports of violence against opposition 
candidates britain however did not follow the united states in 
withdrawing its ambassador 
on thursday the united states recalled ambassador alan green 
over concerns the election will not be free and fair he is 
expected to return before the elections 
iliescu said that if the front wins an absolute majority in the 
voting it will still be open to forming a coalition with other 
political forces 
iliescu and other members of the provisional parliament which 
held its last session friday waited for about an hour saturday for 
a delegation representing the university square demonstrators 
afterward iliescu spokesman paul financu issued a statement 
saying the government was still open to dialogue 
on tueday the first meeting between protesters and the 
government broke down minutes after it began when iliescu refused a 
demand to videotape the discussions and broadcast them live on 
television 
constantin dumitrescu spokesman for a main protest group 
appeared to rule out another attempt at talks saying that since 
the provisional parliament no longer planned to meet there no 
longer exists the institutional framework for resolving our 
demands 
iliescu and other members of the front are former communists who 
served under ceausescu all now profess democratic convictions and 
several iliescu among them turned against ceausescu long before 
he fell

jurors in the murder trial of a man accused in 
the bensonhurst racial slaying told the judge saturday that theyd 
reached verdicts on some charges but couldnt agree on others 
judge thadeus owens instructed jurors in the trial of keith 
mondello 19 to retire for the evening telling them to get a good 
nights sleep and give it your best shot tomorrow 
another jury considering murder and other charges against a 
second defendant 19yearold joseph fama ended another day of 
deliberations without reaching a verdict in the slaying of yusuf 
hawkins 
hawkins a black 16yearold was shot to death aug 23 in the 
mostly white bensonhurst section of brooklyn 
more than 200 demonstrators rallied in hawkins memory saturday 
afternoon outside the brooklyn courthouse where both juries were 
deliberating 
the mondello jury began deliberating monday evening and the fama 
panel late tuesday 
at 650 pm saturday jurors in the mondello case sent owens a 
note saying we the jury are unable to reach a unanimous 
decision 
owens asked jury forewoman mimi snowden whether the jury was 
deadlocked on all the counts she responded no some of the 
things 
mondellos attorney stephen murphy asked owens to accept the 
verdicts that had been reached but the judge denied the request 
the jurors did not specify their verdicts or the charges 
there seems to be a very hard deadlock there murphy said 
jurors had been instructed to start with the most serious of the 
charges murder murphy said he believed the jurys note indicated 
it had found mondello innocent of murder charges and was deadlocked 
on lesser charges 
if they had already convicted him of the murder charges then 
thered be no sense deliberating any further on any of the 
others he said 
both juries reheard testimony from trial witnesses saturday 
afternoon 
prosecutors say mondello organized a mob of batwielding whites 
that surrounded hawkins and three black companions when they came 
into bensonhurst to look at a used car 
fama allegedly stepped from the mob and fatally shot hawkins in 
the chest with a 32caliber automatic 
shortly after 6 pm saturday the fama jury asked to have 
sunday off so they could sleep late then go bowling and see a movie 
we understand this would be at our own expense theres a 
bowling alley near the motel the jury said in a note to the 
judge 
the judge said he would allow them to sleep late sunday but 
said they would have to resume their deliberations 
both juries are sequestered 
saturdays demonstration began with a march by about 500 people 
from the intersection where hawkins died 
local residents shouted not guilty not guilty as the 
marchers went by justice for yusuf countered the marchers 
the atmosphere was tense but the march was orderly and without 
major incident more than 200 police in riot gear walked with the 
demonstrators 
later about half the marchers took buses to the courthouse 
where they stood outside and chanted what do we want justice 
when do we want it now 
the rev al sharpton a community activist who organized the 
march calmed the crowd as members surged against police 
barricades declaring through a bullhorn this is a dignified 
nonviolent march 
sharpton then accompanied hawkins parents moses stewart and 
diane hawkins to a fourthfloor courtroom to await the verdicts

coast guard approval of exxon corps 
final plan for cleaning up the valdez oil spill includes a 
requirement that the company protect sites that may have been 
inhabited 7000 years ago 
the work plan for exxons final cleanup was approved friday by 
coast guard rear adm david ciancaglini 
the approval requires that exxon develop a program to protect 
cultural resources such as archaeological artifacts in areas 
affected by the march 1989 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil in prince william sound 
exxon already had been working on plans to protect cultural and 
archaeological resources before ciancaglini made it a provision of 
his approval said company spokesman joe tucker 
the admiral just wanted it in writing agreed coast guard 
spokeswoman gail williams were talking the same program but we 
just want to make sure its done 
three teams of archaeologists in helicopters have been surveying 
prince william sound and the gulf of alaska charles mobley an 
anchorage archaeologist overseeing those aspects of the cleanup for 
exxon said saturday 
mobley said the best way to protect the areas cultural 
resources would be to stay clear of it altogether even after the 
spill 
second best would be stationing archaeologists to watch over 
exxon crews cleaning up beaches as was done last year he said 
exxon federal and state land managers and representatives of 
alaska native corporations are working to reach agreement on how 
best to preserve the archeologically important sites to satisfy the 
coast guard 
the entire oil spill area has archaeology in it mobley said 
he said the area reaching west from prince william sound and 
south to the alaska peninsula represents 7000 years of habitation 
by natives 
authorities say lack of research funds has left the region 
largely unexplored 
but mobley said one spinoff of the attempt to protect 
archaeological artifacts has been an increase in archeological 
knowledge 
before the oil spill archaeology program there were maybe 300 
known sites of archeological importance in the region mobley 
said weve more than doubled that now including sites of 
historic interest 
the tanker exxon valdez wrecked on a chartered reef on march 24 
1989 spewing north slope crude in the nations largest oil spill 
the spill coated hundreds of miles of shoreline and killed hundreds 
of otters and thousands of birds and other animals 
the tankers skipper joseph hazelwood was convicted in march 
of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil into state 
waters but was acquitted of more serious charges 
exxon and its exxon shipping co are charged with two federal 
felonies and two misdemeanors in the spill the trial in anchorage 
on charges that include allowing an incompetent crew to operate the 
exxon valdez was postponed indefinitely last sunday

and a us associate in washington 
the agreement in principle came friday in a meeting between 
chilean and us officials in washington said acting interior 
minister belisario velasco 
he gave few details on the agreement 
velasco said the payments would go to the families of orlando 
letelier a former chilean foreign minister who fled to the united 
states following a 1973 rightwing military coup and ronni 
moffitt an aide to letelier who also was killed when their car was 
bombed in washington 
in the next few days a complete announcement with details 
will be made said velasco in an interview he said the matter 
must now be taken to president patricio aylwin a civilian who 
replaced gen augusto pinochet in march 
pinochet led the 1973 overthrow of elected civilian president 
salvador allende and his military government had blocked efforts 
by us courts and the government to seek compensation in the 
killings 
velasco said the meeting in washington was between deputy 
foreign minister edmundo vargas chiles ambassador to the united

secretary of state bernard aronson abraham sofaer the state

united states against former officials of pinochets secret police 
indicted in the killings 
aylwin who defeated a pinochetbacked candidate in elections to 
replace the military government has promised full cooperation with 
us officials in the case 
in chile the issue is seen as a key battle between aylwin and 
pinochet who remains as army commander and has promised to block 
human rights investigations of the military 
letelier served as chiles ambassador to washington and was 
foreign minister during the allende government in exile following 
the 1973 coup he became a severe critic of pinochets rule

awardwinning novelist walker percy was 
remembered saturday as a man whose books were full of his faith and 
charm 
walker has helped us show that the word is in the words we 
speak and write archbishop francis schulte told hundreds of 
people who gathered at st josephs abbey in this southeast 
louisiana city for percys funeral mass 
percy whose books dealt with modern malaise in the new south 
and the tenuous often comic search for human connection died 
thursday of cancer he was 73 
the dozen priests who celebrated the mass together included 
former new orleans archbishop phillip n hannan and the rev 
patrick samway who presented the catholic book clubs prestigious 
campion award to percy in 1986 and is working on percys biography 
walker percy was a writer he was of course many other 
things father grandfather catholic conversationalist saints 
fan golfer the rev tom clancy former president of wwltv in 
new orleans said in his eulogy 
but most of his energy was devoted to writing clancy said 
in many ways his writings remind us of parables sometimes it was 
hard to get his point but for all their subtlety his stories were 
powerful and moving like jesus walker loved humor and irony 
clancy remembered the author of the 1962 national book 
awardwinner the moviegoer as well as the thanatos 
syndrome love in the ruins and other works as a man who was 
both stubborn and charming 
he has probably already charmed his way into heaven said 
clancy he was a hard man to say no to 
percy who converted to catholicism in early adulthood always 
played down the role of the church in his work but clancy said 
percys books are deeply christian 
percy was buried in a small cemetery set aside for the abbeys 
benedictine monks and for members of their confraternity a lay 
group which works closely with the abbey 
archbishop hannan recalled percy as someone who was gracious 
even when it was hard for him for instance when hannan persuaded 
pope john paul ii to name him as the only american on the 
pontifical council for culture 
accepting the nomination meant that percy had to go to rome 
dress formally and give a speech all things he disliked hannan 
recalled 
although he never met percy steve kanaga flew from san diego 
for the funeral im just a fan said kanaga he said he had 
written once to percy and gotten a letter back 
he said percys books affected him deeply theyre so true 
he said 
it was like percy to have an open funeral said harry 
middleton a senior editor with timelife magazines who got to know 
percy when he reviewed books for the new orleans weekly figaro 
walker used to hang out there we were a bunch of nobodies 
and he loved us said middleton who now lives in birmingham ala 
he said percy helped him move up and had encouraged him to write 
books i didnt think i could write books but he assured me i 
could now im on my third one he said

a former police officer who carried the only 
child survivor from the burning headquarters of the radical group 
move five years ago said saturday that memories of the day still 
haunt him 
i did not want to kill anybody i did not want to get killed 
i can look everyone in the face eyetoeye and say i did my 
best out there i regret what happened said james berghaier 
berghaier a 17year member of the city police force spoke at a 
forum on public policy and human relations relating to the violent 
may 13 1985 confrontation between move and police 
after move refused to leave a fortified rowhouse police sprayed 
the home with bullets then dropped a bomb on the roof 
the ensuing fire rapidly spread through the neighborhood 
destroying 61 homes displacing an estimated 270 residents and 
killing six move adults and five children 
berghaier said he thinks some people believe the police officers 
on duty during the daylong confrontation do not feel remorse for 
those dead or for the residents whose homes were destroyed 
thats not true he said 
the former officer said he suffered bouts of depression after 
the incident and decided recently to talk about it publicly to 
insure the situation does not occur again 
berghaier carried 13yearold michael moses ward then known as 
birdie africa to waiting rescue crews after the child and the only 
adult survivor ramona africa fled to an alley behind the 
flameengulfed move compound 
ramona africa was convicted of riot and conspiracy charges in 
the incident she is serving a 16month to sevenyear prison term 
ward 18 lives with his father in a philadelphia suburb the 
boys mother was a move member who died in the confrontation 
berghaier who works for a janitorial service said he would 
like his 15yearold son to meet michael ward 
the day of the move confrontation was his sons birthday 
berghaier said 
when i saw michael that day i saw my own son he said 
there have been no charges in the incident except those against 
ramona africa an 11thhour attempt by sen arlen specter rpa 
to get a federal grand jury to reopen the case before the statute 
of limitations on civil rights violations expired at midnight 
saturday has failed 
move spokeswoman alberta africa who also spoke during the 
forum said the group never believed anything would come of 
spectors efforts 
these are the same people involved in the same government that 
was involved may 13 she said we are not naive to think they 
would do anything 
she said move continues to seek the release of members serving 
prison terms in a 1978 move clash with police which was at the 
root of the may 13 conflict 
nine move members were convicted of thirddegree murder 
attempted murder and assault charges stemming from the 1978 
gunfight which left one police officer dead and seven others 
injured

reports of drug trafficking by usbacked 
afghan guerillas including the mujaheddin have been ignored by 
american officials for several years according to a published 
report 
the washington post said in its sunday editions that unnamed 
us officials have received repeated firsthand accounts of heroin 
smuggling by guerrillas under the command of gulbuddin hekmatyar 
but decided against further investigation 
i have absolutely no comment on that said state department 
spokesman mark dillen when asked about the report saturday night 
these are stories that we will have to more formally respond 
to later dillen added 
hekmatyar is an afghan guerrilla commander with close ties to 
pakistans interservices intelligence or military intelligence 
agency the isi has funneled tens of millions of us weapons to 
hekmatyar according to the report 
afghan sources told us officials the isi cooperates with 
heroin production and commanders led by hekmatyar run heroin and 
morphine production laboratories in southwestern pakistan the post 
reported 
the heroin is then smuggled from pakistan through iran to 
turkey the balkans and europe the afghans told the newspaper 
the bush administration has acknowledged that individual 
mujaheddin commmanders may have condoned heroin opium production 
but has refused comment on invovlement by hekmatyar who served in 
the afghan interim government or the pakistani military 
the sources told the post us concerns about the soviet 
presence in the region and maintaining good relations with pakistan 
took precedence over drugfighting efforts there 
there has been very little debate on the issue one source 
told the newspaper 
it has been terribly frustrating for the drug enfocement 
administration and others to weave narcotics matters more closely 
into general policy in afghanistan said a senior us diplomat

a 24yearold woman has been 
hospitalized after years of living under a plastic sheet and eating 
only canned food out of fear of radiation from the chernobyl 
nuclear accident police said saturday 
the woman spent at least two years wrapped in the sheet and left 
her couch in the family home only to go to the bathroom according 
to national police spokesman arie van turnhout 
the dutch woman was hospitalized last month with an inflamed 
bladder after her parents contacted a doctor said van turhout he 
said police began an investigation into the case only last week 
after hearing of the case on the village grapevine 
the woman who was not identified suffered from severe 
malnutrition and cramped joints van turnhout said 
an investigation found out the woman hadnt washed and had 
refused to eat anything but canned goods since the april 30 1986 
explosion of the soviet nuclear power plant van turnhout told the 
associated press 
her parents had been told to humor their daughter until her fear 
of being contaminated subsided he said but did not disclose who 
gave the advice 
its just a miserable psychosocial case he said adding the 
entire family from this southwestern dutch village would be 
undergoing therapy 
shortly after the chernobyl accident the dutch government 
briefly banned the sale of spinach and ordered the stabling of all 
dutch cattle as the cloud of radioactive fallout swept west from 
the soviet ukraine

countries 
according to official soviet figures 31 people were killed in 
the explosion and fire although a soviet newspaper has speculated 
the death toll could be as high as 250

pope john paul ii declared saturday 
that the mexican government should not consider the roman catholic 
church a constitutional enemy but rather an ally in the fight for 
a more moral society 
in a state of law the full and effective recognition of 
religious freedom should be the fruit and guarantee of civil 
liberties john paul told mexicos bishops in his strongest call 
yet for legal recognition of the church 
despite being overwhelmingly catholic mexico has harsh 
restrictions on church activity that date to 1859 
the church was for many years considered a reactionary force by 
the governing institutional revolutionary party but the rules 
which include bans on a church role in education and participation 
in political life have been winked at in recent years 
a theme that certainly concerns us as pastors of the church 
in mexico is the present civil legislation about religious 
material the pope said 
the church in mexico wants to be considered and treated not as 
something strange nor as an enemy that must be confronted and 
fought but as an ally of all that is good noble and beautiful 
john paul said 
he made his remarks in an address dedicating a new headquarters 
for the roman catholic episcopal conference of mexico in this 
industrial suburb 15 miles north of mexico city 
the pope said the church could help the mexican government by 
strengthening family life and giving young people the majority of 
the population deeper moral values 
john paul also expressed profound satisfaction for the climate 
of greater understanding with the government illustrated by 
president carlos salinas de gortaris recent naming of a personal 
envoy to the vatican 
the move was seen as a step toward reestablishing diplomatic 
relations broken in 1926 
john paul also reviewed for the bishops many of the themes that 
he had already touched on during his stay in mexico he said the 
bankruptcy of communism showed the futility of building a society 
without god but he also criticized capitalism for its materialism 
he said family life should be strengthened with faith attacked 
artificial birth control and praised the bishops work in dealing 
with workers who migrate to el norte the united states 
full of illusions about making progress that corresponds to their 
own expectations 
later the polishborn pope attacked the mixing of marxism and 
catholicism in socalled liberation theology before both the 
bishops and in a later address to an audience of 10000 priests 
nuns seminarians and students at christopher columbus college a 
catholic instituion in mexico city 
referring to the collapse of communism in eastern europe he 
said it was incomprehensible that some sons of the church in 
these lands mexico persist in presenting as viable models whose 
disaster is obvious in other parts of the world 
in a final address to a gathering of 1500 members of mexicos 
intellectual and cultural community at the national library the 
pontiff took up the theme again saying that while communism had 
been discredited the culture of materialism in the west has not 
yet assured a civilization that dignifies man 
earlier in the day during a visit to the central mexican 
farming region of zacatecas the pope expressed sympathy for the 
hundreds of thousands of workers who migrate to the united states 
each year 
i want to remember also those who for different 
circumstances have had to emigrate from this land obliged to seek 
their living elsewhere the pontiff told a flagwaving crowd of 
over 200000 spread across a rocky redclay mountainside 
the lord also suffered the injustice of having to abandon his 
land 
john paul spoke in a region of northcentral mexico once known 
for silver mines but now dominated by farms and grinding poverty 
in recent years the state of zacatecas has become one of the 
centers of illegal migration to the united states 
the pope told hundreds of thousands of people gathered for a 
mass on a rocky redclay mountainside outside zacatecas that 
manual work had dignity 
he denounced exploitation and said workers needed adequate 
forms of association to defend your rights referring to unions 
the pope was scheduled to leave mexico sunday morning stopping 
briefly on the caribbean island of curacao before reaching rome on 
monday 
it was john pauls 47th trip outside italy since becoming pope 
and his 10th pilgrimage to latin america
