university officials are investigating 
allegations that an 11yearold boy who became the youngest person 
to graduate from college was allowed to take a staggering course 
load that one authority called unconscionable 
in some of his classes at the university of california at santa 
cruz adragon de mello was struggling to just pass according to a 
report published sunday the boy received a degree in computational 
mathematics last year 
adragons advisers should have been concerned by the pressures 
on him his often mediocre work and the high number of waivers and 
grade changes he received said uc santa cruz vicechancellor 
isebill gruhn 
the college advising system apparently let him down she 
said in sundays editions of the santa cruz sentinel which 
obtained copies of adragons transcripts evaluations and other 
university documents 
after viewing the documents last week gruhn called the boys 
course load unconscionable 
uc santa cruz chancellor robert stevens said friday that his 
office will investigate the handling of the boys academic career 
adragon made national headlines and became an entry in the 
guinness book of world records when he graduated last june 
his father agustin de mello defended his sons academic record 
any negative evaluations of his sons work were written by 
people who were prejudiced against the boy said de mello the 
father had drawn up plans for raising a boy genius including 
advanced degrees and a nobel prize by age 16 even before adragon 
was conceived 
it was the university de mello said that placed all the 
pressure on his son to take so many classes that was because the 
family could not get the kind of financial aid to support two years 
of study instead of one he said 
according to university records cited by the paper adragon took 
a double load of classes and often used petitions and waivers to 
win exceptions from ucs usual requirements 
and while adragon did well in some mathematics and computer 
classes he struggled in others his performance in one astronomy 
course was the poorest of anyones in the class and was far below 
the passfail cutoff the instructor wrote in an evaluation 
the source of this stress was probably the fact that 
according to what he told me he was taking six courses this 
quarter wrote the professor merle walker if it is true i 
question why the relevant authorities within the university 
permitted him to do this 
the usual load at the santa cruz campus which issues pass 
or fail grades is three courses per quarter gruhn said it was 
a serious matter for any student to take even four 
adragon on three occasions also did not complete his course work 
by the end of the term and petitioned to have the grades changed to 
pass after completing makeup work

thousands of people from budapest hungary to wichita kansas 
marked the 20th annual earth day on saturday with protests against 
the exxon tanker spill ozonedestroying chemicals and other 
environmental concerns 
but demonstrations fizzled in sweden and india for lack of 
interest and a rally in west germany attracted less than 100 
people officials said 
in new york city about 1000 demonstrators rallied at exxons 
midtown headquarters then marched to the united nations 
organizers estimated the crowd swelled to more than 5000 people by 
the end of the march but police put the number at 2500 
the exxon tanker exxon valdez ran aground near valdez alaska 
on march 24 spilling 101 million gallons of crude oil into 
wildliferich prince william sound in the worst such spill in 
american history 
in a speech to demonstrators activist jeremy rifkin said 
environmental politics had changed dramatically since the first 
earth day in 1970 
all of our previous environmental crises have been regional in 
nature now we are experiencing for the first time a global 
environmental crisis rifkin said the greenhouse effect 
global warming ozone depletion acid rain and species extinction 
now threaten the entire planet and all the inhabitants that live in 
it 
this is the first international earth day he said claiming 
it was the first time demonstrations were coordinated around the 
world 
in rome about 1000 people and 40 environmentalists cheered as 
20 protesters dressed in cardboard costumes resembling aerosol cans 
and refrigerators ran up the spanish steps and smashed through a 
paper hoop symbolizing the earths ozone layer 
the demonstration was intended to reenact the creation of holes 
in the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons which are chemicals used 
in aerosol propellants and refrigerators 
ozone occurs naturally in the earths stratosphere and screens 
out harmful ultraviolet light from the sun studies have shown that 
chlorofluorocarbons are breaking down the protective barrier

out for a demonstration sponsored by the radical party 
demonstrators included ilona cicciolina staller a 
hungarianborn porn actress and a radical party member of italys 
parliament and nobel prizewinning biophysicist maurice h f 
wilkins of britain 
near wichita kan about 750 people gathered outside chemical 
plants owned by racon inc and vulcan chemicals to demand they stop 
using chlorofluorocarbons within a year 
according to environmentalists racon is one of five us 
companies that produce the chemicals and vulcan is major supplier 
to those businesses 
spokesmen for the two companies said a ban on 
chlorofluorocarbons is not realistic because reliable alternatives 
have not been found and that the chemical industry is spending 
billions of dollars trying to find other substances 
in frankfurt west germany only about 60 people turned out for 
a demonstration at the hoechst chemical company police said 
the weather was pretty rainy and that might have had 
something to do with it said police spokesman wolfgang nebelung 
about 500 people rallied at a park in san jose calif and 
marched to an ibm plant where they tied green and white ribbons on 
a gate to protest the use of chlorofluorocarbons in the electronics 
industry 
in this beautiful setting we are dealing with a problem that 
in 20 years could be deadly in 20 years it may not be safe for 
people to lie in the sun consumer advocate ralph nader said at 
the rally 
more than 1000 people learned how to make nontoxic household 
cleaners and received other environmental tips at an exposition at 
michigan state university in east lansing 
about 200 people gathered in chicago for an earth day observance 
that resembled a picnic more than a protest 
speakers however criticized exxon for its part in the oil 
spill this would not be a safe place for a person from exxon 
said bob rudner of greenpeace 
bill harding showed up in a bathrobe made of common lawn grass 
and hawked growyourown starter kits for 25 each 
it makes me feel closer to the earth harding said its 
like you have your own portable environment

1949 except for the decade of the cultural revolution which ended 
in 1976 
over the past year however authorities have acknowledged 
growing social unrest including increased crime and strikes much 
of the unrest has been attributed to economic problems including 
high inflation shortages of goods panic buying and profiteering

hundreds of antiracism 
demonstrators marched for seven miles along a highway saturday to 
protest a gathering of skinheads and neonazis nearby 
after dark the leader of the white supremacists was heard 
leading a crossburning ceremony and a glow was visible to 
reporters a halfmile away 
police worked throughout the day to head off any confrontations 
between the two groups 
the 500 mostly young demonstrators on the walk for racial 
equality carried banners that proclaimed celebrate diversity 
and no aryan homeland in our home 
were trying to show the rest of the country that idaho is not 
just potatoes and nazis said russ gee a 26yearold who was 
among a contingent of people from the university of idaho 
a phalanx of idaho state police and kootenai county sheriffs 
patrol cars screened the marchers as they walked down a paved 
bicycle path alongside the northern idaho highway a police 
helicopter hovered overhead 
the potential for violence and an unwillingness to give 
publicity to the white supremacists led some human rights groups to 
boycott the march which ended two miles from the aryan nations 
compound where a threeday conference of neonazis and skinheads is 
being held 
up to 2000 antiracism marchers had been expected but 
organizers said the opposition by some groups and cloudy 47degree 
weather may have kept the numbers down 
the marchers came from throughout the pacific northwest and 
represented such groups as gay and lesbian activists the 
washington state rainbow coalition and people opposed to south 
african apartheid 
meanwhile about two dozen participants in the white supremacist 
gathering goosestepped down the 200foot road leading to their 
compound to meet with reporters earlier they canceled a march of 
their own saying skinheads did not want to be exposed to the 
demonstrators 
kim a badynski the northwest organizer for the ku klux klan 
said a cross would be burned there saturday night 
reporters were kept a halfmile away from the gathering at the 
30acre ranch of richard butler whose aryan nations group wants to 
turn the northwest into a whites only homeland but butler 
could be heard leading a crossburning ceremony after dark and a 
glow was seen coming from the ranch 
sheriffs deputies had set up checkpoints on roads leading to 
the aryan nations camp near hayden lake to check the ids of people 
entering the area 
weve established what we feel to be tactics that are going to 
ensure the safety of all the parties involved said sheriffs 
capt tom dickson 
lisa anderson organizer of citizens for nonviolent action 
against racism the coeur dalene group sponsoring the march said 
she expected few problems 
thirty to 40 neonazi youths were staying at butlers ranch 
butler said white supremacist leaders including ku klux klansmen 
would hold workshops on the white supremacist movement 
the antiracism march was endorsed by jesse jacksons rainbow 
coalition and washington gov booth gardner but groups such as the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith stayed away 
marvin stern regional adl director in seattle said his group 
views with great concern the events surrounding this weekends 
planned conference but decided not to march because of the burden 
on law enforcement and potential for violence 
gov cecil andrus also refused to endorse the march echoing 
fears that it could promote violence and give white supremacists 
more publicity 
the adl estimates there are 2500 to 3000 neonazi skinheads in 
30 states an increase in both numbers and geography since a 1988 
report stern said 
many skinhead organizations do not espouse neonazi beliefs but 
the conference demonstrates rightwing leaders attempts to recruit 
them he said

king hussein returned home sunday to 
confront the aftermath of rioting over governmentimposed price 
increases 
an official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the king 
and his entourage arrived in the capital after dawn following a 
trip to the united states 
no rioting was reported on saturday or sunday following four 
days of unrest in which at least eight people were killed and 83 
injured in more than a dozen towns and villages 
but security forces kept up heavy patrols in salt maan kerak 
mazar and other cities where rioters attacked government buildings 
and battled police last week 
the only significant demonstration on saturday was at the 
university of jordan in amman where about 300 students peacefully 
marched to express solidarity with rioters 
students chanted down with zaid rifai the prime minister 
who is blamed for the austerity measures witnesses said they also 
chanted long live king hussein 
rioters throughout jordan have expressed support for hussein 
while demanding rifais resignation 
on friday several hundred rioters in nearby salt smashed bank 
fronts looted a finance company demolished police cars and pelted 
officers with rocks according to residents and security officials 
the situation now knock on wood is calm crown prince 
hassan told reporters at the royal palace on saturday 
hussei canceled a trip to britain to speed his return home 
the king interviewed on cable news network by syndicated 
columnists rowland evans and robert novak on saturday blamed the 
unrest on economic problems caused by the failure of other arab 
nations to come through with promised aid to jordan 
the underlying causes are the reality of foreign debt incurred 
and equivalent to commitments made by certain arab states he 
said citing libya algeria saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
nations 
hussein said the austerity that resulted is not easy for 
jordanians but that his countrymen are certainly determined to 
stand in the future stand on our own feet 
the price rises were mandated by an international monetary fund 
agreement under which jordan is rescheduling its 6 billion foreign 
debt they came after more than a year of economic problems caused 
by declining foreign income 
in jerusalem an israeli government official said saturday that 
authorities there were concerned about the disturbances in 
neighboring jordan 
i dont think there is an immediate danger to israel but we 
have a general interest that jordan should be stable he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
king hussein is a plausible partner for peace he added 
its safer to keep what we have and what we know instable 
regimes in this region have more of a tendency toward 
belligerency 
but israeli rightwing politicians have argued that the 
replacement of hussein by a palestinian leader would benefit 
israel palestinians constitute about half of jordans population 
they have said jordan could then become a true palestinian state 
and thus solve the issue of palestinian selfdetermination without 
israel having to make territorial concessions 
west bank palestinians meanwhile called on their brethren in 
jordan to avoid the disturbances 
we are concerned that any problems in jordan might divert 
attention from the main issues of the palestinian conflict said 
said kanaan a prominent plo supporter and businessman from nablus 
the riots mark the worst civil unrest since the jordanian army 
crushed palestinian guerrillas in 197071 at the time israeli 
troops were deployed along the border prepared to intervene in the 
fighting if necessary

ethnic minority groups within the burma 
communist party insurgency have rebelled against the party 
leadership and seized control of its national headquarters a 
stateowned newspaper said sunday 
the working peoples daily said forces made up of persons from 
national racial groups could not bear the domination of the 
party in their political military and economic affairs and the 
conflict between them grew 
it said the rebellious members captured the party headquarters 
in pangsang about 415 miles northeast of rangoon and the 
northcentral branch office in mongkoe about 125 miles north of 
pangsang both are in shan state 
the newspaper did not say when the rebellion took place 
with 1500020000 fighters the burma communist party is the 
strongest of a dozen guerrilla groups fighting the authoritarian 
government the groups leadership has been dominated by members of 
the ethnic majority the burmese but most of the fighters are from 
minority groups 
government officials said earlier that the wa and the kokang 
ethnic groups recently revolted against the communist leadership 
and this was confirmed sunday by independent sources who traveled 
to the area of fighting 
a source who demanded anonymity said there were reports the 
ethnic groups arrested some communist leaders 
the communists recruited the minorities after taking over their 
areas along the chinese border they have paid them small amounts 
of money to fight mainly in major operations 
the communist insurgency to overthrow the government began 
shortly after burma was granted independence from great britain in 
1948 the party says it stands for democracy but much of its 
financing comes from opium trafficking 
the insurgency has weakened because china has reduced and 
possibly cut off its once significant aid to the communists in 
order to improve relations with the burmese government 
the turmoil within the party comes as the government has 
inflicted major defeats on the karen national union another major 
insurgent group based along the eastern border with thailand 
on tuesday government forces seized the karens maela camp 135 
miles northeast of rangoon after a 2monthlong offensive a 
government spokesman claimed that more than 600 guerrillas were 
killed in the battle 
another major karen stronghold maw poh kay fell three weeks

official china daily said sunday 
the government is now taking measures to cut foreign borrowing 
which has been growing at an annual rate of 38 percent during the 
past four years the newspaper said 
in recent weeks the government has limited the number of 
financial institutions and government offices allowed to borrow 
abroad 
under new regulations only 10 financial institutions are 
authorized to obtain foreign loans and only the central bank the 
peoples bank of china can borrow from the international monetary 
fund

chinas prudency in handling foreign debt and said china would not 
become a problem debtor nation 
but he said chinas debt grew too rapidly last year and warned

alternative lists often farleft views on key matters

students collected money on beijing street 
corners sunday so they could start a newspaper to present what they 
say will be an accurate account of a week of unrest 
at least one staterun daily meanwhile broke an apparent news 
blackout in the official press on the student demands for 
democratic reform 
the science and technology daily a newspaper for intellectuals 
came out sunday afternoon with a sympathetic but carefully worded 
account of the gathering saturday of 150000 student demonstrators 
on tiananmen square 
a chinese journalist said reporters from the paper threatened to 
quit during a stormy allnight debate that delayed publication of 
the paper which usually comes out in the morning 
further complications arose when the postal service refused to 
deliver the paper and reporters wound up delivering the edition 
students said 
several students sought donations on beijing street corners so 
they could form their own paper 
our movement is not to raise our salaries or get better jobs 
after graduation said one qinghua university student in a speech 
to a crowd of about 200 its for democracy and freedom its for 
the country 
another student said they had collected more than 500 yuan 
about 135 in two hours 
one person asked why he donated 5 yuan said i believe in the 
truth i believe people need to know what really happened at 
tiananmen square 
in china the press is run by the government which censors news 
in its attempt to control the flow of information the government 
views the press as a tool of the communist party 
in an apparent effort to discredit the demonstrators only the 
most violent aspects of the recent protests breaking out in several 
parts of china have previously been reported 
last week newspapers reported in some detail protesters 
attempts to break into the communist party headquarters in beijing 
they did not say that police beat and kicked students 
on sunday the official xinhua news agency and the staterun 
radio reported a violent clash in xian provincial capital of 
shaanxi during which mobs of lawless elements torched vehicles 
and buildings 
the radio of hunan province also reported that rioters in the 
provincial capital changsha broke windows and beat up police 
during a demonstration there 
both violent protests also were reported on the nationally 
televised nightly news 
the science and technology daily made no mention of violence 
along with several photos of the students marching peacefully 
it carried two articles on the beijing demonstrations 
university students expressed a common feeling that day 
continue the spirit of hu yaobang carry forward the flags of 
democracy and science and push forward the reforms it wrote 
hu yaobang is the former communist party chief whose april 15 
death sparked the demonstrations hu was admired by intellectuals 
for his reformist views and won sympathy when he was ousted from 
power in 1987 for failing to stop prodemocracy student protests

the words the witness put in oliver norths 
mouth were dramatic startling in their directness i dont care 
if i have to go to jail i dont care if i have to lie to 
congress 
thats what fundraiser carl spitz channell testified he 
heard north tell texas billionaire nelson bunker hunt 
the testimony in norths irancontra trial which went to the 
jury last thursday galvanized norths lawyers 
defense attorney brendan sullivan interrogated channell trying 
to demolish his credibility 
why was channells story coming up now for the first time was 
he making it up wasnt it true he still faced sentencing on a tax 
charge in the irancontra affair wasnt it true the government 
could tell the sentencing judge channell had been a very helpful 
witness 
channells testimony last month went to one of the central 
questions the jury must consider as it deliberates norths fate 
whether he obstructed and made false statements to congress in 1985 
with criminal intent 
the jury debated the case all day friday and then again on 
saturday morning before quitting for the weekend deliberations 
will resume monday morning 
at the time north spoke with the texas billionaire national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane was signing off on letters to 
congress denying that north was assisting the contras north is 
accused of preparing drafts of the letters 
norths fate hangs to a great degree on the question of intent 
to obtain a conviction the government must prove general intent 
on norths part in connection with four charges that he made false 
statements to congress and the attorney general about his role in 
the irancontra affair that is he must have acted knowingly and 
voluntarily in making false statements 
north said he wanted thenpresident reagan to invoke executive 
privilege with mcfarlane refusing to answer the congressional 
inquiries north said he was overruled by his superiors 
the burden on the government regarding intent is heavier on the 
other eight criminal charges against north there the government 
must prove specific intent that is that north acted with a bad 
purpose 
there is no doubt that north accepted a 13800 home security 
system paid for by irancontra codefendant richard secord 
north said he accepted the system because he was trying to 
protect his family after terrorist abu nidal placed him on a hit 
list and after he had made unsuccessful efforts to get the 
government to provide protection 
theres no doubt north accepted 4300 in travelers checks from 
adolfo calero as part of a 300000 cash fund north ran out of his 
office safe north accused of illegally converting the 4300 to 
his own use acknowledged that he destroyed the ledger which showed 
how the money was spent the reason he destroyed it says north is 
that he was trying to protect the names of contra leaders whose 
lives might be jeopardized if they were exposed 
the prosecution has been stung by testimony concerning intent 
one of norths colleagues at the national security council 
vincent cannistraro testified that he recognized norths proposed 
responses to congressional inquiries as false in 1985 and gestured 
to signify that norths nose was growing like pinocchios 
but added cannistraro north told him he was having a dispute 
with mcfarlane over how to respond 
north indicated he was not an entirely free agent in composing 
his answers cannistraro said he indicated a process by which 
his answers were modified or changed 
cannistraro gave the testimony about pinocchio to a grand jury 
in 1987 but prosecutor john keker asked why hadnt he said a word 
then about north telling him he was having a dispute with mcfarlane 
over the false answers 
even the judge jumped in on the questioning asking when the 
testimony about the dispute had come to mind 
i thought of it yesterday after meeting with norths 
lawyers cannistraro answered

while most of america enjoys a respite from 
presidential campaigning the countrys teachers are engaged in one 
of the hottest leadership contests in the history of the national 
education association 
the candidates are a personable vice president with years of 
innercircle experience and a passionate champion of underdogs 
prone to taking reasonable risks come july one of them will 
be president of the 19millionmember union the nations largest 
with hats buttons banners and floor demonstrations the scene 
at the washington convention center july 25 promises in many ways 
to resemble last summers political conventions 
but there will be at least a couple of major differences at 
8000 delegates the nea convention will be bigger than the 
democratic and gop parleys combined and instead of serving as a 
forum to anoint a preselected candidate this gathering will be 
marked by ferocious lastminute campaigning and delegatehunting by 
the two men who hope to succeed mary futrell 
observers agree futrell highly popular with teachers and sought 
after by the media will be a tough act to follow during her 
unprecedented sixyear tenure she has raised both the unions 
profile and its credibility on education issues 
futrell also helped the nea weather withering attacks by former 
education secretary william bennett and shed its obstructionist 
image during a period of increasing dissatisfaction with public 
schools and calls for changes in teaching curriculum and school 
management 
teachers who dont want to rock the boat are lining up for keith 
geiger a conscientious team player during his last six years as 
nea vice president those seeking a more impassioned leadership 
style are leaning toward john wilson an executive committee member 
and special education teacher from raleigh nc 
geiger points with pride to his negotiating ability and 
political activism honed in long years of collective bargaining 
and democratic politics in michigan wilson touts his current 
status as a parttime classroom teacher and an actionoriented 
leadership style he says is lacking in geiger 
were both establishment candidates but one of us is an 
activist the question is do you want an active or a passive 
president asserts wilson 
wilsons campaign slogan a better leader for tomorrow because 
he teaches today cuts to the heart of his argument that geiger 
is too much the bureaucrat too long gone from the classroom 
thats a phony issue mary futrell has been out of the 
classroom for nine years and i dont think anybody is saying shes 
not a good president geiger shoots back he depicts wilson as a 
hardliner who would lead the nea back into its obstructionist past 
the difference is whether were going to hold onto our 
longstanding oldtime traditional unionist hat that we have to 
oppose everything that comes down the line unless we promote it or 
were going to work for the kinds of education reform that will 
help move the organization along geiger said 
ed foglia a wilson partisan and president of the california 
education association called wilson a reasonable risktaker 
keith is a very personable individual but he is not about to take 
on the hard fight that john wilson would he is much more of a 
compromiser 
geiger and his supporters see that as an advantage its very 
easy to get on the stump when you havent had the opportunity to 
work with power brokers and a whole set of people with vastly 
different ideas you have to be a negotiator said kathy bell 
president of the nea affiliate in florida 
nowhere are the candidates differences more apparent than the 
way their campaign literature treats the controversial 
toppriority issue of teacher pay 
wilson says the union should expose the misuse of evaluation 
systems for teacher pay and stand firm in our opposition to 
merit pay and career ladder programs geiger says the nea should 
work for dramatic pay raises in a few key states that would serve 
as models for other states and try to get more federal money for 
education though he opposes merit pay it is never mentioned in 
his statement 
to geiger wilsons adamance recalls the unions inflexible 
past to wilson geigers avoidance of issues smacks of selling out 
to public opinion i dont really believe in a goalong to 
getalong attitude wilson says i will not compromise the 
needs of our members for a good editorial

the littleknown husbands of some of 
washingtons most powerful women are rallying behind the banner of 
their spiritual hero denis thatcher the retiring spouse of 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and patron saint of the 
obscure 
members of a tongueincheek support group called the denis 
thatcher society are men whose wives are deservedly more 
prominent and influential than they are says founder charles e 
horner 
the society is designed to help these men maintain the 
obscurity they have worked so hard to earn he says 
horner knew his wife had beaten him at the washington power game 
a few years ago when he received a letter addressed to mr and 
mrs constance horner 
although horner has a respectable job as associate director of 
the us information agency his wife oversees 22 million federal 
employes as director of the office of personnel management and has 
been nominated to become undersecretary of the department of health 
and human services 
the criterion for membership is that your spouse had to be 
appointed to a job you wish you had says lawyer r james 
woolsey who was navy undersecretary under president carter 
woolsey says he was known only as sue woolseys husband in 
white house receiving lines when his wife was associate director 
of the office of management and budget for human resources 
as undersecretary i was trying to obtain some very limited 
money for the navy woolsey recalled my wife on the other 
hand had control of 51 percent of the federal budget and was 
moving billions of dollars around my envy knew no bounds 
woolsey summed up the virtues of a bona fide society member when 
he toasted thenrep dick cheney rwyo at a banquet honoring his 
wife lynne cheney chairman of the national endowment for the 
humanities 
he praised cheney as a spouse who dresses nicely entertains 
well and works productively outside the home 
cheney has lost any potential eligibility for society membership 
by becoming president bushs defense secretary horner says 
although he might form an alumni chapter to tell us how it is on 
the outside running the pentagon and chastising generals 
the society has no membership list no initiation rites no 
secret password or handshake not even an annual dinner where 
members can commiserate over brandy and cigars 
ive been thinking lately that we should meet for lunch at 
some refined place equivalent to schraffts in new york perhaps 
the tea room at garfinckels department store in spring valley 
mused horner 
we might have cold consomme a tomato surprise chicken salad 
some petit fours and weak tea we couldnt wear white gloves but 
bow ties might be de rigueur 
horner said his colleagues would like to entertain thatcher 
whom theyve never met the next time the wealthy british business 
executive comes to washington 
and theyre eagerly awaiting the official visit next june of 
pakistans prime minister benazir bhutto in the hope that her 
poloplaying husband asif ali zardari will tag along 
he may not want anything to do with us and who can blame 
him said horner 
eligible males dont seek society membership and arent invited 
to join says thomas harvey a former veterans administration 
official whose wife cathie black is publisher of usa today you 
belong only in your own heart harvey says 
bernard norwood a private economic consultant says hes 
contented to bask in the glory of his wife janet who is 
commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics while mrs norwood 
presides over the annual convention of the american statistical 
association here this summer he says his assignment will be 
overseeing the wives tea 
boston stockbroker john heckler recalls that when he was married 
to former rep margaret heckler rmass later to become health 
and human services secretary and still later ambassador to 
ireland he was shocked to receive an invitation to become 
president of the congressional wives club but turned the offer 
down i cant be he replied for gods sake im a man 
but most members have learned to accept their lowly status with 
good cheer and even a measure of manly pride 
as secondincome earners we try to be very busy and 
productive lest people think we have jobs only as political 
spouses horner said 
while his wife works late or gives speeches on the banquet 
circuit horner says he spends his leisure hours reading the 
classics in search of greater wisdom 
said horner what unites us is that we believe this is a very 
enviable position its wonderful one of the best things that can 
happen to any man 
our central ideological principle is that the womens movement 
is the best thing that ever happened to men and our only hope is 
that women dont come to their senses anytime soon

there is evidence that the pilots involved in a 
deadly 1987 airliner crash blamed in part on a warning system 
failure intentionally disconnected a similar alarm on another jet 
two days earlier the planes maker says 
in a petition filed with the national transportation safety 
board douglas aircraft co a division of mcdonnell douglas corp 
said the pilots pulled a warning system circuit breaker on the 
first plane interrupting power to the system and silencing an 
unwanted warning the detroit news reported sunday 
the same pilots john maus and david dodds were in control of 
northwest flight 255 a mcdonnell douglas md80 when it crashed on 
takeoff at detroit metropolitan airport on aug 16 1987 
the pilots died along with 154 other people including two 
people on the ground the only survivor from the plane was a 
4yearold girl it was the second worst aircraft accident in us 
history behind the 1979 crash of an american airlines jet near 
chicago that killed 275 people 
the ntsb concluded last may that the warning system on the md80 
failed to alert the pilots that they hadnt set the wing flaps and 
slats which provide added lift for takeoff 
the board faulted the pilots for not setting the flaps and slats 
and failing to complete a routine preflight checklist the board 
also said power to the warning system was interrupted but couldnt 
determine why 
douglas petition obtained by the newspaper cited a note 
written by northwest pilot merrill hodges in september 1987 hodges 
said he found an alarm system circuit breaker pulled on another 
md80 jet flown by maus and dodds 
flight records show maus and dodds landed that plane in santa 
ana calif on aug 14 1987 and the plane stayed on the ground 
until hodges entered the cockpit the next day douglas petition 
said 
the unavoidable conclusion is that the absence of power to the 
takeoff warning system was the flight crews intentional 
disablement of the takeoff warning the petition said 
northwest lawyer carroll dubuc said douglas petition doesnt 
raise anything new and promised to file a response that will rebut 
douglas claim 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified official of the air line 
pilots association as saying the claim is false the official said 
the union also is preparing a response 
douglas petition filed feb 17 asked for a modification of 
the probable cause finding on the crash adopted by the ntsb 
last may douglas proposal would blame the crash solely on the 
crew and exonerate the warning system 
more than 100 lawsuits have been filed by relatives of 
passengers killed in the crash douglas could try to use a change 
in the ntsb ruling to reduce its liability 
elayne bendel a representative of douglas acknowledged the 
petition contains no hard evidence to indicate when or where maus 
and dodds pulled the circuit breakers 
however she said we feel the highest probability is that the 
crew disarmed the system 
the ntsb said it was possible the crew pulled the circuit 
breaker but could find no evidence of it nor could the board 
substantiate northwest and the pilot associations claims that the 
circuit breaker was faulty

state attorney general robert t stephan 
uses courts to fight crime but a former employee has mired him for 
6 years in a court fight that cost him a shot at higher office 
contributed to the breakup of a marriage and sent him into 
bankruptcy court 
stephan a republican serving his third fouryear term says he 
may retire from public life although his popularity remains high 
and his personal problems do not appear to have hurt his 
effectiveness 
im going to persevere but ive had about as much pain as 
anyone in public office ever has stephan 56 said in a recent 
interview god knows that those who inflicted that pain were not 
justified in doing so 
if there is a hell hes suffered it on earth said rep dan 
glickman a democrat who is a friend of stephans 
the case started in december 1982 when marcia tomson stingley 
who had been fired from a clerks job in his office filed a 
lawsuit accusing stephan of sexual harassment she accused him of 
making lewd advances crude remarks and suggestions of sexual 
activity 
stephan denies her allegations but agreed in march 1985 to 
settle the lawsuit for 24000 and other considerations including 
finding someone to buy her house and helping her get a job in 
california 
the settlement required that the terms be kept secret but later 
in that year while stephan considered a 1986 bid for governor 
rumors arose that ms stingley had received state money he 
divulged that friends had raised the 24000 from private sources 
and said he regretted having settled an unfounded and 
ridiculous lawsuit 
ms stingleys attorney charged breach of contract for revealing 
the settlement and threatened another suit unless stephan paid her 
265000 stephan refused and the second suit was filed knocking 
him out of the governors race although he was reelected attorney 
general 
the second case went to trial and a federal court jury last 
november awarded 200000 to ms stingley who is now 53 
stephan has appealed but couldnt afford to post the bond 
required to block garnishment of his wages for the judgment on 
march 31 he filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors which prevented the withholding a fourth of his 
3200amonth takehome pay 
don krueger one of ms stingleys attorneys criticized stephan 
for avoiding the payment by the bankruptcy filing and said he 
should resign 
but glickman defended stephans action sayinghe has a 
perfectly justifiable right to use the bankruptcy court like any 
other citizen does 
ms stingleys daughter deborah dempsey of san diego said her 
mother will not comment on the case while the judgment is under 
appeal 
during the trial last fall ms stingley testified that stephan 
pushed her against a wall and asked her to have an affair with him 
she said she did nothing to encourage him 
i told him i did not want this to occur it was offensive to 
me it was demeaning she said stephan made sexual advances 
numerous times she said 
stephan whose second wife divorced him during the litigation 
has married again and recently purchased a new home he said his 
financial problems might force him to look for other work in 1990 
that would pay more than his state salary of 62832 
politicians from both parties agree that stephan would probably 
have little trouble winning a fourth term if he seeks it 
he has won praise for pushing legislation to guarantee certain 
rights to crime victims and has been a leading voice advocating 
solution of the states prison overcrowding 
bill hoch a kansas city political consultant who managed the 
campaign of stephans democratic opponent in 1986 said stephan 
remains virtually unscathed by the stingley case 
ive been absolutely fascinated with the mans rapport with 
people he said it goes to the fact that when bob stephan says 
he cares about people they believe him

quoth the raven out help come 
on lets go and let me out but never nevermore 
the twopound bird with a 2foot wingspan arrived thursday at 
the point defiance zoo and aquarium from san jose calif 
out cried the raven when bird trainer barbara osborn 
released it from a traveling kennel into a large cage 
the bird was turned over to the humane society last september by 
a woman who reportedly adopted it illegally as a nestling or an 
unhatched egg then found it more than she could handle 
the bird was uncomfortable except in human company and even 
scared of crows so society officials contacted the nonreleasable 
animal placement program in texas which advertised the birds 
needs in its newsletter officials at point defiance who had been 
hoping to add a raven to the zoos population responded 
the raven has been dubbed poe or poette depending on its sex 
which zoo biologists have yet to determine unlike the raven in the 
famous poem by edgar allan poe however this bird never says

on the air again 
wnviam in north vernon a town of 6000 people has adopted the 
call letters of the fictional radio station in the 1970s television 
comedy wkrp in cincinnati 
everybodys heard of wkrp said station manager shawn lynch 
however only listeners in and around jennings county will be able 
to hear the 1000watt station 
wnvi management jumped at the chance to capitalize on the name 
recognition when the last wkrp in dallas ga decided to change 
its name federal communications commission regulations allow just 
one station at a time to have the call letters 
the station ushered in its new name april 1 by duplicating a 
wkrp in cincinnati episode that featured a turkey drop from an 
airplane 
instead of live turkeys we dropped a heliumfilled 
turkeyshaped balloon over the high school where they were playing

follow the money is good advice to anyone 
trying to sort out the complexities of a political fight but 
following the debate on the savings and loan crisis almost requires 
an accounting degree 
at the heart of the contentious battle is the bush 
administrations attempt to impose and the industrys struggle to 
resist tougher capital standards 
capital what it is how its counted and why its important 
is not always immediately apparent to people who dont own or 
manage a business 
but members of congress have been warring on the question since 
president bush announced his plan on feb 6 and it remains at 
center stage as the house banking committee takes up its sampl bill 
this week 
legislators sponsoring both the house and senate bills are 
lauding themselves for adopting a gettough stance but consumer 
groups focusing on capital as the key pocketbook question say the 
bills amount to paper tigers with soft teeth 
unless standards are stricter they argue the sampl crisis could 
repeat and next time the cost could be even higher than the 
current pricetag of 157 billion over 10 years or 600 for every 
man woman and child in the united states 
the basic concept of capital is simple enough the owners of an 
sampl put up some money say 5 million and raise 95 million from 
depositors the institution capitalized at 5 percent then makes 
loans totaling 100 million 
thus capital is the difference between an institutions 
liabilities what it owes to depositors and its assets what 
borrowers owe it 
the owners can lose their money but the depositors accounts 
are insured by the federal government and ultimately the taxpayer 
many conservative institutions believe its a sound practice to 
keep a substantial capital cushion but that comes at a price if a 
100 million institution with 10 million in capital earns 1 
million in a year that amounts to a return of 10 percent for the 
owners drop the capital to 5 million and the owners return 
doubles to 20 percent 
however if loans go sour and the institution starts to lose 
money what at first seems like a concern only to sampl owners 
suddenly becomes crucial to taxpayers who absorb any losses in 
excess of capital 
so it would seem to be an easy matter to figure out whether an 
institution is solid 5 percent capital is good 10 percent is 
better 2 percent is lousy 
enter the accountants and the definitions two percent real 
money capital can be better than 10 percent in phony capital 
keeping in mind that capital represents assets minus liabilities 
the key question is whats an asset 
good loans are an asset so are government bonds and an sampls 
building and the pens in its lobby but theres also something 
called goodwill an intangible asset representing the value of 
items like customer loyalty and name recognition 
for a thriving institution goodwill does have a real value for 
which purchasers are willing to pay extra however if an 
institution is sick and has to be shut down the goodwill 
evaporates 
say an institution has 100 million in assets 90 million in 
good loans 1 million in buildings and 9 million in goodwill on 
the other side of the balance sheet it owes depositors 95 million 
and has a seemingly healthy 5 million in capital 
if the institution closed tomorrow sold its 91 million in 
loans and buildings the owners would lose their 5 million in 
capital and still be 4 million short of paying off depositors 
leaving the bill to taxpayers 
thats why the administration calls goodwill phantom capital 
and sen howard m metzenbaum dohio calls it doodlydoo 
congress struggle to define capital and its importance likely 
will stretch into june when competing versions of sampl legislation 
will be reconciled in a housesenate conference 
according to consumers union and consumer federation of america 
goodwill provisions in both bills open wide gaps weakening what 
are ostensibly more severe standards 
the bills boost the minimum capital level for sampls from about 3 
percent to the stricter level imposed on national banks now 6 
percent the senate however would permit institutions to phase 
out goodwill over 25 years while the house would allow as much as 
40 years in some cases 
thats a big loophole goodwill amounts to 21 billion slightly 
more than a third of the sampl industrys capital more than half of 
the nations 2700 solvent thrifts have some goodwill on their 
books 
as a partial plug to the loophole both the house and senate 
would require institutions to maintain at least a 15 percent level 
of tangible or real money capital the consumer groups say 
thats too low and are pushing to double that to 3 percent 
unless congress installs unshakable foundation under the 
thrift industry it has done nothing but throw away hundreds of 
billions of dollars said jane uebelhoer of the association for 
community organizations for reform now

television talk show host morton downey jr 
said in an interview that his verbal assaults on gays were caused 
by a homosexual approach by a doctor when he was 12 years old 
in a television interview to be aired thursday downey also 
backed away from the verbal gaybashing that in part led to local 
cancellation of the morton downey jr show 
i wont make a blanket indictment of any group ever again in 
my life said downey who offered to tape television spots 
decrying violence toward gays 
downey interviewed by kpixtv via satellite from new york said 
he began counseling seven months ago and has learned to be more 
understanding of people with differing lifestyles 
he said he has at least 20 gay friends with aids who i will 
bury including his own brother 
of the homosexual advance toward him downey said i probably 
subconsciously held that dislike deep inside of my system 
his hourlong syndicated series was canceled in san francisco 
after 13 weeks last summer in response to protests by local gay 
rights organizations another station is picking up the show 
beginning monday 
pressure groups in this country have every right to respond 
they have every right to demand that a morton downey jr show be 
taken off the air if it doesnt meet their sensibilities downey 
said in the interview 
downey recently said that the show will tone down the the 
confrontations that first brought it widespread notice he admitted 
friday that changes in his show are designed to temper criticism 
and extend its life

the abrupt decision of tamil rebels to 
come to the negotiating table after six years of waging jungle 
warfare and massacring civilians could herald a breakthrough for 
sri lankas new president 
however it might also be a shrewd pragmatic maneuver by the 
tamil tigers to consign rival tamil groups to the political 
wilderness and then pick up the fight for a separate homeland some 
analysts say 
preparations for peace talks between the rebels and the 
government are likely to start in earnest this week with the 
arrival of the leader of the rebel delegation anton balasingham 
he is a sri lankan native who holds british citizenship and lives 
in london 
the government has blamed the tigers for the deaths of about 
9000 people mostly sinhalese civilians however no major attacks 
have been reported since april 15 when the tigers sent president 
ranasinghe premadasa a letter saying they would accept his offer 
for peace talks 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratna who also serves as deputy 
defense minister said the tigers sudden change of heart may have 
surprised the world but not sri lanka 
after what we have been through nothing surprises us 
anymore he said 
premadasa took office in january replacing junius r 
jayewardene who had governed since 1977 
early this month premadasa declared he was ready to go anywhere 
in the country to meet the tigers he also offered them amnesty 
jobs measures to ensure better treatment of their ethnic minority 
and seats in parliament if they gave up their insurrection 
premadasa belongs to the sinhalese majority which has dominated 
sri lanka since independence from britain in 1949 sinhalese who 
are mostly buddhists comprise 75 percent of the 16 million people 
on this island off indias southern coast 
the tamils who account for 18 percent are mostly hindus and 
say they suffer discrimination under the sinhalese 
tamil sources say the tigers will ask premadasa to dissolve a 
newly created joint administrative council for northern and eastern 
provinces and order new elections with tiger participation 
the government put in motion a plan for greater tamil autonomy 
after an accord with india in 1987 india which has millions of 
its own tamils sent in peacekeeping troops under the pact 
when the tigers refused to participate in the provincial 
elections rival tamil groups that once fought beside the tigers 
swept the balloting the tigers began to attack troops from india 
once viewed as their protector 
the autonomy plan also generated a backlash by militant 
sinhalese who mounted attacks in an effort to force the government 
into tougher treatment of the tamils 
an independent tamil and veteran of the political scene 
suggested the tigers sudden willingness to talk peace may stem 
from a desire to dislodge their former allies from the political 
front afterward the tigers might resume their fight for a 
separate homeland in the northeast he said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the tigers are also expected to demand withdrawal of the indian 
forces the president has also called for a pullout 
the tamil source however questioned whether india would give 
premadasa a free hand to negotiate with the rebels 
an indian government spokeswoman said her government would 
welcome such talks 
indias whole purpose of signing the 1987 accord was to 
bring peace to this country said the spokeswoman for the indian 
embassy who commented on condition of anonymity 
many of the guerrillas are teenagers who have known no work but 
war and killing and some analysts wonder if such fighters will 
accept a political solution 
one tamil soldier who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
was certain the boys in the jungle would lay down their weapons 
if commanders told them to do so 
he said they wear lethal cyanide capsules around their necks and 
sometimes bite them under orders to avoid capture

the professionals who monitor public opinion 
say environmental issues have gained surprising political clout in 
the last 20 years leaving them unsurprised that president bush 
declares himself an environmentalist 
a new study of public opinion polls assembled by three leading 
environmental organizations traces a dramatic shift in american 
attitudes toward the environment since the early 1970s and 
pollsters suggest todays politicians are wise to listen 
the issue of the environment has by now become an explosive 
and decisive cutting edge in mainstream politics writes pollster 
louis harris in a contributing essay to the study 
one need go no further than the march 24 oil spill in alaska and 
the publics perception of inept and confusing attempts by 
government and industry to deal with it to show the interest that 
americans have in the environment suggest the studys authors 
in the aftermath of the spill bushs positive rating on 
environmental issues as reflected by a pair of louis harris amp 
associates polls tumbled 21 points from 60 percent to 39 percent 
republican pollster w lance tarrance jr suggests the alaska 
spill may shape the 1990 election debate by mobilizing voters 
to feel more intensely about the need to act quickly and 
decisively to protect the planets resources 
protection of the environment has become a valence issue 
a basic american value maintains celinda c lake a consultant 
to democratic candidates 
she predicted that bushs response in dealing with environmental 
problems whether his actions are perceived as substantive or just 
cosmetic will have an increasing strategic importance for 
democrats in national elections and in new congressional 
districts 
the views of harris tarrance and ms lake were included as part 
of an analysis of polling trends assembled by americans for the 
environment the sierra club and the national wildlife federation 
since 1970 the year of the first earth day and the dawn of the 
modern environmental movement public attitudes about environmental 
protection have changed dramatically as shown by the result of 
opinion polls cited in the analysis 
here are a few examples 
concern about water and air pollution in 1970 according to a 
gallup poll only 48 percent of those interviewed expressed concern 
about polluted water last year in answer to the same question 84 
percent said they had such worries people who were seriously 
concerned about air pollution increased from 46 percent in 1970 to 
73 percent in 1988 
support for tougher environmental laws and regulations in a 
1977 survey by the roper organization only 27 percent of the 
respondents believed environmental laws and regulations were 
inadequate by 1983 when roper asked the same question 48 percent 
felt that way and last year 53 percent of those interviewed by 
cambridge reports said tougher environmental laws were needed 
spending money on the environment last year 65 percent of the 
respondents to a national opinion research center poll said more 
money should be spent on the environment compared to 48 percent 
who held that view in 1977 a series of roper polls over roughly 
the same time period reflected a somewhat smaller but also 
significant increase 
protecting wilderness in answer to a cambridge reports poll in 
1978 only 19 percent of the respondents chose preserving public 
wilderness areas over opening them for energy development a choice 
of 65 percent in answer to the same question last year 47 percent 
favored preservation compared to 42 percent for development 
greenhouse effect problem surveys by cambridge reports show a 
growing number of people consider global warming as a very 
serious problem in 1982 only 12 percent believed so 24 percent 
in 1986 and 39 percent last year 
a variety of other polls cited by the study also reflect an 
unmistakable shift to a more proenviromental stance says 
david baker chairman of americans for the environment a research 
organization for a variety of environmental and conservation groups 
the message maintains baker is that people are mad as 
hell about the way we treat our environment and they dont want to 
take it anymore

as weary workers in oilspattered rain 
slickers used highpressure fire hoses to blast north slope crude 
from a naked island beach a state observer hovered nearby 
were here to help set some sort of standard on how clean the 
beach should be when they finish said rg reid of the alaska 
department of environmental conservation 
with exxons ambitious shoreline cleanup program for prince 
william sound just gathering momentum the question of how clean 
is clean must be answered officials say at some point cleaning 
could go too far environmentally speaking 
there are no standards said robert pavia a national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration oceanographer you have to 
decide at what point the cleanup becomes more destructive than the 
oil 
the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 dumping 101 
million gallons of thick crude oil into the fertile sound 
the oil has spread in ribbons and rafts for more than 300 miles 
taking the nightmare to several gulf of alaska communities 
dependent on the sea for their fishing or tourism industries 
after prodding from coast guard adm paul yost exxon promised 
to field 4000 workers scores of boats and whatever equipment is 
needed to clean up about 350 miles of oiled shoreline by sept 15 
critics including state dec commissioner dennis kelso say the 
plan is a start but it must be expanded to include more coastline 
in and out of the sound 
there may be hundreds and hundreds of miles of oiled beachs to 
be added to the list said larry dietrich a kelso deputy 
its going to be tough time is critical they either get more 
people out there more equipment out there or they wont meet 
their deadline said colleen burgh a conservation department 
science team leader 
she said in some places oil had soaked to a depth of 20 
centimeters about 8 inches 
youre not going to get it all she said adding that some 
cleaned beaches likely will give off an oily sheen perhaps for 
years 
the plan calls for a peak work force early in june four exxon 
cleanup crews worked at naked island last week 
the question of how clean shorelines must be before exxon crews 
can move on to other beaches may play a significant role in the 
project 
the immediate approach is to hit the most sensitive heavily 
oiled beaches first pavia said when you get done theres 
still going to be oil on the beach 
there is no fast objective method to determine a standard of 
cleanliness for beaches said pete mcgee onsite coordinator for 
the state environmental agency 
theres no time to take samples and send them to the lab and 
do the normal kinds of analysis that you would he said it has 
to be a visual onthespot determination were working on trying 
to figure out how to do that 
were trying to come up with a method where you could visually 
observe the beach and say this is as clean as you can reasonably 
expect it to be and move on to beaches with a higher priority 
he said 
those priorities could include whether a piece of shoreline was 
being used by mating wildlife or was heavily oiled and threatening 
to reoil other beaches 
burgh said decisions will be made on a casebycase basis 
theres no magic formula on when we will sign off on a beach 
alan maki exxons senior environmental scientist said state 
and federal agencies involved will have to set the standards for 
maximum allowable pollution 
id like to be able to tell you sit right down and say 
heres the number pull it off the shelf as i can with metals or 
other organics heres the epa standard heres what it says 
we got to do it just doesnt exist

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
sunday he hopes congress and president bush can reach a compromise 
on raising the minimum wage 
not every threatened veto becomes a veto in fact mitchell 
said on cbs face the nation 
asked whether he believes a compromise is possible the senator 
replied we hope so and were going to work toward one 
bush has repeatedly said the only minimum wage bill he will 
accept is his own an offer to raise the minimum wage from its 
current level of 335 an hour to 425 by january 1992 provided 
employers can pay all new workers a subminimum for up to six months 
measures pending in both the senate and house would raise the 
hourly minimum to 455 by october 1991 and allow a subminimum to 
be paid to some newly hired workers for up to two months 
mitchell noted that there hasnt been an increase in the law 
affecting the minimum wage since 1977 12 years and the last 
increase pursuant to that law took effect in 1981 
no other segment of american society has experienced such a 
period with no increase he said and during that time theres 
been a tremendous and a dangerous polarization of our society 
mitchell contended that those at the very top receive a share 
of income and own a share of wealth that is greater than ever 
before those at the bottom of the economic scale receive a share 
of income and own a share of wealth that is smaller than ever 
before 
we have to do something to redress that wrong and the 
presidents policies are exactly the opposite of fairness and 
equity he said 
on another issue mitchell said he does not favor officially 
reopening the congressional irancontra investigation in light of 
documents released at the oliver north trial which pointed to more 
substantial involvement by president reagan and bush then vice 
president 
i dont believe theres sufficient basis now to call for a 
reopening of the investigation he said 
mitchell added that having asked the president to provide a 
report from the executive branch i will ask the senate 
intelligence committee to conduct an inquiry to determine first 
if documents were in fact not provided to the congressional 
irancontra committee and secondly if so why that occurred

by imposing harsh austerity measures 
romania says it accomplished a feat this month that has eluded 
scores of other nations it paid off a huge foreign debt 
the price however was steep and there is no indication it will 
mean a better life for romanias 23 million citizens who have made 
do with rationed food gasoline electricity and other essentials 
for nearly a decade 
president nicolai ceausescu who has ruled romania since 1965 
borrowed heavily from the west to industrialize and by 1981 the 
foreign debt had grown to 11 billion 
he drove equally hard to repay the debt and reduced it to 66 
billion in the mid1980s in a surprise announcement at a party 
meeting last week he said romania had paid in full 
this proves the might of the romanian socialist economy and 
opens wonderful prospects for romanias advanc to communism 
ceausescu said 
although romania accumulated the debt by industrializing paying 
back the money kept the country from buying foreign equipment 
needed to make the industry run effectively foreign analysts now 
say that buying such equipment may take priority over easing 
austerity measures 
romanias debt stemmed partly from ceausescus choice of 
energyintensive industries such as petrochemicals and steel 
the countrys domestic oil reserves began to dwindle however 
and romania had to rely increasingly on imports to feed huge oil 
refining complexes built in the 1960s and early 1970s when oil was 
cheap after 1981 ceausescu ordered strict measures to save raw 
materials and energy 
food rationing and prison terms of up to five years for hoarding 
have been enforced since 1982 at the same time food exports 
including farm products such as meat ham and wheat increased 
since 1984 the government has periodically cut off heat and 
light and banned driving cars for four months at a time to save 
gasoline which romania has sold in recent years to the united 
states and other countries to raise convertible currency 
gasoline is in such short supply that even the monthly ration of 
five to eight gallons per car could not be supplied recently 
analysts predict that romania will continue to export food and 
other products to the west to earn hard currency for its industry 
and to the soviet bloc in return for raw materials 
such a policy would do little in the short term to raise 
romanias standard of living one of the lowest in europe 
these days romanians must line up for hours to buy eggs cheese 
and butter crowds gather for tacimuri small bags of chicken 
wings and necks 
the food shortages have created a language of misery and 
romanians have coined idioms to describe the substandard food 
available 
patriots for example are pigs feet which being virtually 
unexportable never abandon their homeland 
travelers from romania have reported recent shortages of goods 
such as cosmetics soap shampoo building materials shoes and 
lingerie 
ceausescu the object of a personality cult unrivaled in the 
soviet bloc has not explained publicly why he wanted to repay the 
debt so fast 
the government constantly tells romanians that the ceausescu era 
is an epoch of glory and grandeur and romanias golden age 
despite the consumer shortages jokes abound 
how can romanians pay off their debt more easily by 
auctioning off the golden age goes a recent one

when federal investigators open a hearing tuesday 
into the reasons a forward cargo door was torn off a united 
airlines 747 jetliner some of the best evidence will remain under 
nearly 17000 feet of water near hawaii 
but there may be efforts to raise the ninefootsquare door from 
its watery grave 85 miles southwest of honolulu 
nine people disappeared feb 24 when the door and part of the 
aircraft fuselage along with seats and luggage were swept away as 
flight 811 climbed toward 23000 feet at 300 mph 
though two engines conked out pilot david cronin managed to fly 
the sydneybound plane back to honolulu with no further loss of 
life 
coast guard cutters managed to recover some debris including 
part of the fuselage but a big piece of metal believed to be the 
800pound door was seen on radar as it sank 
lee dickinson a member of the national transportation safety 
board said he may be able to announce before the hearing starts 
tuesday morning whether there will be an effort to retrieve the 
door the hearing is expected to last three days 
even without the door he said investigators hope to learn much 
more about the design and certification of the door on the 747100 
which was one of the first jumbo jets built by the seattlebased 
boeing co 
those among the 13 testifying will also discuss maintenance 
inspection procedures and practices human factors and details of a 
1987 incident in which the cargo door on a pan am 747 opened 
slightly on a flight out of london he said 
next week we will try to get a better understanding of the 
what how everything pieced together as the sequence of 
events occurred in a flash over the ocean 
however he said pinpointing why the accident occurred would 
take several more months of investigation 
boeing would be interested in having that cargo door back 
said jack gamble boeing spokesman a lot of questions could be 
answered by looking at it 
recovery of airplane parts from under thousands of feet of water 
is not unprecedented huge sections of an air india 747 blown by a 
bomb into the sea near ireland in 1985 were recovered and the 
flight recorder of a south african airways plane was recovered from 
the indian ocean in 1987 
there is precedence for the deepwater type of retrieval 
work said gamble but it is expensive and it does take time 
besides said rob doughty spokesman for united there may be 
enough data without the door but thats the ntsbs call 
much of the investigations focus has been on the cargo door 
which may have broken free in an explosive decompression when the 
latching mechanism failed 
united records indicated there had been problems with the door 
before the accident including a faulty seal and electrical 
problems requiring the door to be closed manually rather than 
electrically on several occasions however doughty said it was 
apparently not major repair work and it was proper to close the 
door manually as well as electrically 
the faa on march 3 issued an emergency order requiring all us 
airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight 
aluminum latch mechanisms with steel so the doors would be less 
vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing

an american expert in rebuilding cities 
after earthquakes said sunday he has agreed to draft a master plan 
for leninakan one of the soviet armenian cities leveled by a quake 
in december 
eduardo lozano a former professor of urban planning at harvard 
university who has helped rebuild devastated cities in peru and 
nicaragua said he worked out the agreement last week with 
officials in moscow and armenia a soviet republic 
i wasnt sure it said exactly what it was supposed to say 
because its in russian he said but as soon as i got back i 
took it over to be translated and it turned out to be exactly what 
i thought 
lozano 52 said money for the planning and much of the 
reconstruction are being raised by armenian relief agencies in the 
west 
he said his cambridgebased architecture firm lozano white amp 
associates inc expects to spend about a year on the project 
beginning in june with an aerial survey of leninakan 
the city which had 220000 residents before two enormous quakes 
and several smaller ones toppled most of its buildings on dec 7 
is now a maze of army tents shoddy temporary shelters and 
halfdestroyed buildings 
the most haunting sight ill never forget it was an old 
byzantine church cut open right in half as if with a saw 
lozano said 
because the quake struck in the middle of the day many children 
were at school and hundreds were left orphans he said 
a lot of the population was housed in precast concrete 
apartment buildings that crumbled like matchsticks he said i 
knew they were bad but until you see them you dont know how bad 
they were instant concrete graves 
soviet officials have estimated that the quake killed 40000 to 
55000 people in the cities of leninakan spitak and kirovakan and 
in up to 100 villages 
lozano said he plans to bring soviet architects to cambridge in 
late summer for training in urban planning computeraided design 
and methods of making buildings resistant to earthquakes 
he said his master plan will call for reconstructing the 75 to 
150yearold stone buildings in the citys center which withstood 
the quake much better than the newer apartment blocks on the 
outskirts 
he would like to see a new city hub built north of the city 
with athletic facilities schools and shops 
instead of large orphanages lozano said he will call for dozens 
of small group homes linked to schools 
those kids should not be in an institution and they should 
not be torn from their roots and sent to other cities he said 
a native of argentina lozano came to the united states in 1962 
to study architecture and urban design after receiving a doctorate 
from harvard he taught at harvard and princeton universities and 
then founded his firm in 1974 
lozano said he was contacted by soviet officials a few days 
after the quake when a delegation from yerevan the armenian 
capital visited cambridge its american sister city 
although his firms payment depends on the success of 
independent fundraising efforts lozano said he is not concerned 
about the fees 
im committed to do it no matter what he said this is 
what i live for i dont have a yacht i dont ski i love what i 
do which is to plan cities

me said phyllis coehlo the wife of rep tony coehlo dcalif 
the house majority whip 
mrs wright an adoptive texan who came to washington as a 
secretary in wrights congressional office 24 years ago has tried 
to avoid the limelight since the house ethics committee concluded 
last week that her husband violated 69 rules some of the 
allegations stem from her employment by wrights friends 
in an interview with the washington post mrs wright staunchly 
defended the couples conduct calling her husband the most 
honest man i know 
neither jim nor i ever intended to evade the law in any way 
shape or form she said my god hes been there for 30 years 
why all of a sudden would he do a shady thing like that

mrs wright failed to do any work for a company called mallightco 
jointly owned by wright and george mallick a developer in fort 
worth texas the city wright represents mallightco paid mrs

consumers called for a boycott of some 
food products to protest soaring prices and many merchants 
retaliated by closing their shops in the latest tensions over 
algerias crumbling economy 
protests against rising prices have spread in recent weeks 
triggering occasional violence several dozen people were injured 
april 16 and many shops were looted in a riot at the market in the 
southwestern village of aflou 
authorities said two policemen were among the injured and that 
about 50 people were arrested 
the commerce ministry has promised to enforce price controls 
more strictly and the staterun press has blamed the increases on 
speculators and those who starve the people 
in algiers and oran the biggest cities in this north african 
arab country posters have gone up calling on consumers to boycott 
meat and other products whose prices shot up almost overnight 
in reply many merchants went on strike saturday and threatened 
to keep their stores closed if the boycott calls continued 
i dont have to boycott meat i cant afford to buy it at 
these prices salah laribi a 47yearold father of six said in 
an unusually deserted algiers market sunday 
beef has jumped in price to about 1135 a pound almost double 
the going rate a few weeks ago tomatoes have doubled in price to 
150 per pound and onions have quadrupled in cost 
the algerian dinar officially is worth 167 cents but black 
market traders offer at least five times the official rate for 
dollars and other hard currencies 
it is not entirely clear why prices have shot up so suddenly 
although the algerian economy has been crippled in recent years by 
tumbling oil prices oil and gas account for more than 95 percent 
of the countrys export earnings 
frequent strikes by government employees and workers for 
publicsector companies have caused still more problems in the past 
six months especially a strike that has paralyzed major ports at 
skikda and arsez 
violent demonstrations that claimed hundreds of lives in october 
began as protests of high prices but turned into an attack on state 
control of the economy and the authoritarian socialist government 
the violence prompted president chadli bendjedid to institute a 
series of constitutional reforms that are to pave the way for a 
multiparty system 
in recent months about 30 new political parties have been 
formed but they have been discreet in their activities while 
awaiting government action to legalize them

public housing tenants caught in a crossfire 
of gangs and dope peddlers see a tough new eviction policy as a 
step toward a safer neighborhood despite opposition from defenders 
of civil rights 
omaha housing authority director robert armstrong calls his 
agencys eviction policy the toughest in the nation and us 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp has praised it as 
an example others should follow to help rid housing projects of 
drugs and gangs 
the omaha agency adopted the policy last week arming itself 
with the power to evict tenants who themselves or whose children or 
other household members including guests are suspected of 
certain crimes 
kemp last week announced hud actions aimed at easing the 
eviction process for local agencies that operate federally 
subsidized housing projects among other things hud is making drug 
offenses a specific violation of leases 
last month alexandria va mayor james p moran secured a 
waiver from hud rules that allow a tenant to appeal eviction to an 
administrative panel or court the mayor asked for the waiver to 
speed evictions of suspected drug dealers hud agreed after being 
satisfied that tenants rights including the right to take their 
complaints to court were adequately protected under state law 
in omaha tenants leases have been amended to explain they may 
be evicted if drug or violent criminal activity is suspected inside 
or outside the project without regard to whether or not any 
person whose conduct is at issue has been arrested charged or 
convicted 
armstrong said he will review each case and evictions will not 
be automatic he said residents will be allowed to appeal in court 
and can avoid eviction by arranging for counseling or other 
rehabilitation 
however critics say the leases violate tenants rights because 
evictions are allowed based on activity off the grounds and without 
regard for whether anyone has been charged 
they are basically evicting people because they have criminal 
characters said gary fischer senior attorney for housing for 
the omaha legal aid society 
armstrong and other community leaders said most public housing 
residents back the tough policy 
i havent heard anyone who lives there say they are against 
it said jesse sharpe director of community services for family 
service a united way agency 
residents of omahas logan fontenelle housing project which is 
so violent it has been nicknamed vietnam say the sound of 
gunfire often punctuates the night and drugs are dealt openly 
police have stepped up foot patrols 
i cant let my kids play outside said tina jones who lives 
near crack corner in the project my little boy hes been in 
the middle of two shootings my daughter picked up a needle on the 
way to school 
francis smith an oha board member who has lived in public 
housing for 22 years said she supports the policy as a last resort 
i didnt like the idea at first because of the idea of 
evicting the whole family because one member of the family got 
caught with drugs away from home ms smith said 
kemp said last week that authorities will have to consider the 
role parents played in drug activity by their children before 
evicting entire families 
most youths in the projects live with a single mother or with 
grandparents who may not always know what the child is doing said 
avoca mason chairman of the black ministers commission 
fischer said the oha should have no authority to regulate 
activity off the project grounds the housing authority is saying 
by this policy that we are requiring the parent to be omniscient 
the lawyer said 
oha attorney steven riekes said the policy was prompted by the 
1988 federal antidrug abuse act which allows evictions based on 
criminal activity but does not define such activity 
if the tenant was selling cocaine from his unit and for some 
reason he is not arrested for it nevertheless the housing 
authority has proof and a preponderance of evidence if it can 
prove in a civil eviction suit that the person is using cocaine 
then that is all that is necessary riekes said

marching about a mile to the georgian cultural center 
there they raised clenched fists and observed a minute of 
silence for the 19 people killed april 9 in the georgian capital of 
tbilisi soldiers have been accused of using shovels to beat 
protesters who were demanding independence for georgia the 
official press has said an irritating chemical agent was used on 
the protesters

procession for 16yearold natia barhsaleishvili who died april 17 
of injuries sustained in the clash said sergei dandurov dandurov 
speaking from tbilisi said police did not interfere 
in moscow protesters pushed past police barricades spilling

black muslim minister louis farrakhan brought 
a fiery close to african american summit 89 on sunday accusing 
government leaders of formulating secret policies to perpetuate 
poverty and drug abuse among blacks 
citing statistics showing declines in white births farrakhan 
said powerful whites want to destroy the black community to keep 
from losing power in the next century 
i firmly believe that the national security council of the 
united states and the president as well as former presidents 
have had this question under serious consideration and have quietly 
formulated a policy to deal with this problem farrakhan told an 
enthusiastic crowd of about 1000 gathered in the new orleans 
convention center 
farrakhan called poverty a subtle form of genocide and said 
highly addictive crack cocaine may have been introduced in low 
income areas by people who wanted black youths to sell death to 
each other 
it was the final speech at the african american summit billed 
by its organizers as a meeting to develop a political and social 
agenda for the 1990s 
the decision to invite farrakhan to attend the conference had 
drawn criticism he had not indicated in advance that he planned to 
attend and his speech was not listed on the advance schedule 
the invitations to controversial activists like farrakhan 
prompted black republican leader fred brown of new york to boycott 
the summit which drew only half the 2000 people organizers had 
predicted a week before it began 
farrakhan drew a storm of criticism in 1984 for calling judaism 
a gutter religion and making other remarks about jews that his 
supporters said wre taken out of context in his campaign to foster 
black pride 
in his remarks sunday he acknowledged that his views are 
controversial but said anyone who avoided the summit because he 
was invited perpetuated a slave mentality afraid of losing 
political support or contributions from powerful political masters 
summit chairman richard hatcher former gary ind mayor who 
organized a similar gathering in his home city in 1972 defended 
the invitation to farrakhan and delegate sheldon king of chicago 
said conservatives or moderates who avoided the summit lost a 
chance to voice their opinions 
how can you not be here said king 
the summit ended with the presentation of a sevenpage agenda 
that hatcher and policy director ron walters said will be expanded 
upon in coming weeks 
the preliminary document calls for among other things 
increased government spending for education creation of minority 
jointventures aimed at building capital in black communities 
development of strategies to increase black political power and 
more involvement by blacks in efforts to end apartheid in south 
africa and ease oppression of blacks throughout the world

four colorful balloons rose into the 
desert sky at dawn sunday for a belated start of the gordon bennett 
distance race in hopes highaltitude wind currents would carry them 
into the midwest 
about 3000 people watched as the first helium balloon the 
bright yellow rosie ogrady floated from ruth hardy park at 645 
am about 10 hours after gusty winds forced officials to scrub 
saturday nights scheduled departure 
the other three balloons took off over the next hour 
competitors dumped sand ballast to reach the 12000foot level and 
catch easterly winds of 30 mph to 40 mph 
the race is decided by the balloon that travels the farthest 
regardless of where it lands 
race officials said they regretted delaying the launch to 
morning because balloonists were forced to blow out precious helium 
that expanded in the warmer daytime air a nighttime launch 
preserves the cool contracted gas 
if we would have launched last night we would have gotten more 
distance said race director tom heinsheimer 
but he said the gusts of 25 mph saturday night left him no 
choice but to decide on the postponement 
despite the daytime launch the winning balloon still could 
travel some 1000 miles with clear sailing the whole trip landing 
sometime monday night as far away as kansas or nebraska said 
meteorologist carl garczynski of the national weather service 
the record in the modern era of the race was 1346 miles set in 
1981 by pilots ben abruzzo and rocky aoki 
on sunday threetime race winner joe kittenger flying the 
rosie ogrady with copilot sherry reed used the most aggressive 
launch strategy dumping large amounts of sand ballast to quickly 
reach the strong winds at 12000 feet 
other competitors lifted off more slowly to preserve ballast 
the race named for the late new york herald publisher gordon 
bennett was inaugurated in 1906 when bennett offered a prize to 
the balloonist who could float the greatest distance from a given 
point 
in the early years the event was held at various points in the 
united states and europe it was suspended at the outbreak of world 
war ii and revived in 1979 the race has originated in palm 
springs since 1984

thousands of christians trying to flee 
their besieged enclave north of beirut were left stranded sunday 
after a cypriot ship heading to lebanon to rescue them turned back 
under syrian artillery fire 
the 4000ton baroness m had been scheduled to anchor off the 
port of jounieh the christians only sea link with the outside 
world after darkness fell to pick up some of more than 3000 
christians waiting there 
but port sources in jounieh speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the ferry turned back before it reached the port and was 
sailing for larnaca on the south coast of cyprus 130 miles 
northeast of lebanon 
port officials in cyprus said the baroness m was carrying only 
its crew and a handful of passengers who had sought to get into the 
christian enclave 
despite the barrage around jounieh port officials in cyprus 
reported earlier that another ferry the larnaca rose arrived in 
larnaca sunday with 650 christians after it ran a gauntlet of 
syrian fire saturday night 
syrian troops and their moslem druse allies fired more than 100 
shells and rockets into the christian enclave north of beirut 
sunday seeking to sever the christians escape route 
police said about 100 shells and rockets exploded around 
jounieh where more than 3000 people are waiting to be picked up 
and a coastal strip running north to the ancient port of byblos 
they said the shellfire caused no casualties and did little 
damage 
the firing was minor compared to the fierce barrages that 
hammered the 310squaremile enclave for the last six weeks in some 
of the most ferocious barrages of the 14yearold civil war 
by police count at least 270 people have been killed and nearly 
1000 wounded since the battles erupted march 8 
the artillery and rocket duels between mainly christian army 
units led by army commander gen michel aoun and an alliance of 
syrians and their militia allies died down wednesday 
aoun 53 also heads the countrys christian government which 
is vying for legitimacy with a rival moslem government he has 
declared a war of liberation against the syrians who have 
40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league mandate to keep the 
peace in lebanons 14year civil war 
despite the lull the syrians have continued to target jounieh 
12 miles north of beirut they aim to prevent supplies getting to 
aouns forces and halt the ferry service to cyprus 
the two ferries have evacuated more than 13000 christians and 
foreigners since march 8 
they no longer risk docking in jounieh instead they anchor 
offshore and passengers are shuttled out in small boats under cover 
of darkness 
beirut residents traumatized by the weeks of almost nonstop 
bombardment have been living without electricity or water and 
suffering from acute food bread and fuel shortages 
the french navy tanker penhors loaded with 6000 tons of fuel 
oil sent by paris to aid the lebanese docked sunday at the zahrani 
oil terminal in south lebanon to unload onethird of its cargo for 
a drusecontrolled power plant in nearby jiye 
police said the penhors will sail to the christian harbor of 
zouk later sunday to unload the rest of its cargo at the main power 
plant for beirut 
a chartered transport plane carrying 80 tons of medical and food 
supplies from italy landed at larnaca sunday the supplies will be 
shipped to lebanon later 
a second plane also carrying 80 tons of italian relief aid was 
scheduled to arrive in larnaca monday 
french foreign minister roland dumas said in paris sunday that 
at frances request the permament members of the un security 
council the united states the soviet union china france and 
britain have agreed to give secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar a mandate to work with the arab league to seek peace in

peace talks without progress and they will be asked to reconvene 
possibly in june un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said

cuellar said of the fourth round of talks we have clarified 
positions again but what i call progress has not been obtained 
but the process is still alive

problem was iraqs rejection of a fourpoint plan involving troop 
withdrawals repatriation of prisoners freedom of navigation and 
clearing of the shattalarab waterway between the two countries

period for troop withdrawals but said iraq refused all proposals

the house ethics committee investigation of 
speaker jim wright moves to san antonio this week where panel 
members will interview the texas businessmen involved in an oil 
well investment that netted large profits for the blind trust held 
for the embattled democratic lawmaker 
two committee members and panel investigators reportedly will 
spend three days in texas beginning monday to interview san 
antonio financier morris jaffe his business associate and son 
md doug jaffee jr and two others involved in the oil well 
deal 
at the same time wrights lawyer in washington william c 
oldaker is expected to continue negotiations with the ethics 
committees special outside counsel richard j phelan over a 
timetable for the speakers personal appearance before the panel 
the ethics panel officially the committee on standards of 
official conduct charged wright with 69 instances of violating 
house rules in his dealings with fort worth developer george 
mallick and evading limits on outside income through bulk sales of 
a book authored by the speaker 
wright denies any wrongdoing and says he will fight the 
allegations 
the first phase of its investigation finished the panel now 
turns to considering whether there is clear and convincing proof of 
violations and if so deciding whether to recommend disciplinary 
action to the house 
a spokesman for wright mark johnson said no resolution of the 
washington negotiations is expected until later in the week 
the wright case continues to dominate interest on capitol hill 
particularly on a week with little else on the agenda 
the senate remains out of session all week on an extended 
passover break and the house does not return until wednesday when 
action is scheduled on a supplemental appropriation bill for the 
current fiscal year and the house banking panel continues work on 
its version of a measure to shore up the sampl industry 
the ethics committee said last monday in its report on wright 
that it was still investigating how a wrightmallick company bought 
a 4 percent interest in an oil and gas well for 99000 putting 
up only 9120 in cash and sold it the same day for 440000 
phelan said the committee needed to determine whether wright had 
knowledge of the deal which involved the jaffes a west 
germanowned firm and the blind trust established for wright in 
1987 
the wright spokesman johnson has repeatedly said the speaker 
was unaware of the transaction 
a key issue in the overall wright case is whether he accepted 
gifts from people with a direct interest in legislation before 
congress house rules prevent members from accepting gifts totaling 
more than 100 in a calendar year in such situations 
one of the many companies controlled by jaffe has sought to 
share in an air force program under study by congress for 
developing the nations next jet pilot training aircraft according 
to numerous news accounts last week 
jim dement a san antonio real estate developer and a friend of 
morris jaffe said jaffe is eager to explain the oil deal at a news 
conference but only after he has been interviewed by ethics 
committee questioners 
he morris jaffe didnt know wright had an interest in the 
deal until afterwards dement said 
the jaffes hometown newspaper the san antonio light said the 
two businessmen are longtime democratic party contributors and 
that wright has visited them often 
according to the ethics committee report the deal involving the 
north sabine lake prospect in orange county texas unfolded this 
way 
mallightco a company owned by wright his business partner 
mallick and their wives acquired a 4 percent interest in the well 
from jaffe energy corp on may 10 1988 for 9120 cash the deal 
was arranged by michael mallick georges son 
the same day mallick cut a deal with union rheinische petroleum 
inc a subsidiary of a west german firm which advanced mallightco 
440000 of that figure 90000 was to pay mallicks share of the 
drilling costs 
the deal was structured so that mallightco received 350000 in 
cash while owing jaffe no money for drilling expenses 
on june 9 1988 mallightco bought wrights shares of mallightco 
held by his blind trust for the same amount made in the oil 
deal 350000 
the transaction raised questions because of previous problems 
with the well itself according to the committee report 
while tests on april 23 1988 showed promise of hitting oil and 
gas there were alarming declines in the prospects several days 
later the committee said the well clearly had tapped into a 
reservoir containing some oil and gas but because the well 
pressure readings steadily declined during all tests it was also 
clear that the well was not a gusher 
by may 4 less than a week before mallightco made its huge 
profit the well had declined to a point that it was uneconomical 
to test the negligible quantities of gas and no oil 
because of the problems mallicks interest was worth a 
fraction of the 440000 paid by the union rheinische firm 
according to the report 
that assessment is disputed by morris jaffes friend dement 
who said geologists were still reporting the well had potential at 
that time 
the well was shut june 9 the day wrights interest in 
mallightco was purchased by mallick the site later was abandoned 
a vice president of union rheinisches parent firm told the wall 
street journal last week that he had been unaware of wrights 
interest in the sale to his firm 
he also said that doug jaffe manages the firms us 
investments and the company made the investment in sabine lake 
after conferring with jaffe 
meanwhile the fort worth startelegram reported that a fort 
worth developer who testified before the house ethics committee 
about buying copies of wrights book has filed an affidavit 
contending his testimony was distorted 
the ethics committees report had said that s gene payte 
contributed 6000 toward revising and distributing the book 
reflections of a public man but received only 300 to 500 
copies 
however payte said in the affidavit that he actually had 
testified that he received 1000 copies although he had 
acknowledged he wasnt sure of the number payte told the newspaper 
he has rechecked his records and is now certain he got the full 
1000 books he paid for 
payte had bought the books after wright had declined to accept a 
5000 contribution

their own homes and have no plans to sell or move elsewhere 
according to local aging experts 
persons 85plus are now the fastestgrowing age group in the 
county said the report between 1985 and 2020 this age group 
will almost triple 
the report predicted that almost one out of three marin 
residents will be 60 or older by the year 2020 the median age is 
expected to rise from 336 in 1980 to 426 in 2000 and 477 in 2020 
almost 10 years older than the projected statewide median of 381 
and one out of every four elderly people interviewed for the 
report complained of financial problems with 45 percent living on 
annual incomes of less than 10000 
to try to head off trouble in this paradise and elsewhere the 
buck center for research in aging has hired dr jacob brody a 
leading expert on the cause and control of disease to help study 
marins aging population 
this is a good group to study because we know theyre not 
going to retire to florida joked brody theyre still going to 
be there to study when theyre even older 
the countys eldery provide a very stable intelligent 
welleducated group on whom basic research can be done to make 
it better to be old for all of us brody said 
brody dean of public health at the university of illinois and 
william satariano an epidemiologist and associate professor of 
public health at the university of california will try to 
distinguish between the aging process and the disease process 
we want to divert thinking away from cancer heart attacks and 
strokes and toward common ailments whose alleviation will make 
elderly life more fun and less burdensome brody said 
we want to know how basic science can postpone these 
conditions that we just assume are part of getting old brody 
said we want to arrest the downside of being old 
the buck study will look at 2000 volunteers with 500 people in 
each the age groups 5564 6574 7584 and 85 and older

his policies

prominent jordanians submitted a petition decrying the spread of

the communistled national democratic 
front urged major political parties sunday to form an alliance with 
rebel forces to press for the removal of us military bases 
the front whose 12 underground organizations include the 
communist party of the philippines and the new peoples army made 
the proposal in a statement delivered to news organizations on its 
16th anniversary 
we are building the solid foundation of the sovereign peoples 
democratic mgovernment which can be reasonably expected to emerge 
within the next decade said the statement issued by satur 
ocampo a negotiator in failed peace talks with president corazon 
aquinos government 
ocampo said groups opposed to us intervention in the 
country are welcome to the front and could form part of a 
consultative body that would determine the rebel governments basic 
elements 
major traditional political parties and independent groups 
could form an alliance with the national democratic forces for the 
immediate dismantling of the us military bases and total 
opposition to us intervention in the nations affairs ocampo 
said 
the offer came a day after new peoples army rebels claimed 
responsibility for the killing of us army col james rowe who 
was ambushed friday on his way to work in suburban manila 
the rebels said rowe was slain because he was a direct 
participant in the governments counterinsurgency program the 
51yearold colonel served as chief of the ground forces of the 
joint usmilitary advisory group which provides training and 
logistical support for the philippine armed forces 
the united states maintains six military installations in the 
philippines including clark air base and subic bay naval base two 
of its largest facilities overseas about 40000 soldiers and 
dependents occupy the bases while another 100000 americans reside 
in the country 
last week the front offered to declare a unilateral ceasefire 
and enter peace talks if mrs aquino promised to close the bases by 
1991 when their lease expires the front added that it was 
determined to make us imperialism pay dearly for the continuing 
stay of its bases 
mrs aquino who refuses to say if she will support the bases 
extension brushed aside the rebel proposal and said there must be 
no conditions for renewing negotiations the first attempt for a 
peaceful settlement of the 20yearold rebellion collapsed two 
years ago over differences between the government and rebel agendas 
government troops tightened security around us installations 
and at manilas international airport following fridays attack 
which came two weeks after rebels bombed a us communications 
station in the northern province of benguet there were no injuries 
in the bombing

anfield stadium closed its gates 
sunday evening bringing to an end the weeklong procession of 
soccer fans paying respects to the 95 people killed in britains 
worst sports disaster 
the tragedy occurred april 15 at the hillsborough stadium in 
sheffield 60 miles east of liverpool during the opening minutes 
of a game between liverpool and nottingham forest teams 
in sheffield archbishop of york john habgood told the 
congregation at a memorial service not to lash out in anger until 
more is known about what caused the deadly crush at a section of 
the stadium packed by fans from liverpool 
during the past week an estimated 1 million people made their 
way through anfield stadium the home of the liverpool team about 
half of the field was covered with flowers and scarves of soccer 
teams from throughout the country 
after a brief religious observance at the stadium sunday the 
last mourners left and police closed the gates 
sheffields 1000seat cathedral of st peter and st paul was 
filled to overflowing for the memorial service that was carried by 
louspeakers to people gathered oustide 
they heard the anglican archbishop advise against trying to find 
a scapegoat for the deaths 
he said disasters are brought about by mistakes misjudgments 
and mischances coming together in a deadly combination there are 
times when it is right to be angry but anger which is allowed to 
spill over before the true facts are known anger based on 
speculation anger directed at those who cannot answer back is 
merely destructive 
anger now when so much is uncertain can only make the 
task of learning from this disaster that much harder the 
archbishop said 
within hours after the disaster there were accusations against 
police and also some fans a government investigation is under way 
a memorial service also was held in nottingham

people all over alaska silenced their 
anger and anguish for five minutes sunday to remember how things 
were before a tanker spilled 101 million gallons of oil in an area 
rich in beauty and wildlife 
some hung their heads while others stared straight ahead as if 
lost in thought in cordova a small fishing community 
beforehand a folk singer played on the emotions of the 200 
people at cordova high schools gymnasium when he sang i betcha 
if this had happened off of kennebunkport itd have been cleaned 
up the very same day 
kennebunkport is the maine community where president bush keeps 
a seaside home some here have accused the bush administration of 
being unresponsive to the alaska spill the worst in the nations 
history 
schoolchildren presented a mural of how prince william sound 
looked before the spill and a book on how they would remove it 
one child wrote she would ask her dad to clean it up another 
said he would let tanker captains drink only water a reference to 
the sobriety test that captain joseph hazelwood failed after his 
vessel rammed a reef causing the spill 
the period of silence was requested by gov steve cowper to mark 
the 30day anniversary of the spill 
this disaster has almost turned us into people who arent 
human weve been running on adrenalin just to get things 
accomplished said belle mickelson who teaches commercial 
fishing at cordova high school 
we need a quiet time to reflect on why were here doing this 
and to get set for the long haul a bandaid isnt going to fix 
this she said 
meanwhile a storm threatening wind up to 30 mph and 9foot seas 
pushed oil to unstained shores over the weekend and forced a 
cleanup crew to take shelter 
we expect to have some pretty severe weather for a few days 
said bill lamoreaux an alaska department of environmental 
conservation supervisor it will definitely have an impact on 
skimming operations 
the crude oil from alaskas north slope poured from the exxon 
valdez on march 24 after the tanker hit a reef in prince william 
sound an important fishing area at the southern end of the alaskan 
pipeline 
inadequate equipment and a slow response complicated recovery of 
the oil which has been driven by currents to kodiak island the 
nations no 1 fishing port 
thousands of birds and marine mammals have been killed by the 
oil and biologists fear many more will die 
fishermen frustrated by the pace of the cleanup have taken to 
sea in a makeshift flotilla using scoops and buckets to gather the 
oil that threatens their livelihood 
angry letters to the editor occupied five pages of sundays 
anchorage daily news comments included a suggestion that exxon 
executives be tossed into pools of oil and a proposal that 
residents donate to the recovery effort the dividend checks of 
several hundred dollars that they get annually from oil profits 
we thought we could have our cake and eat it too said 
mickelson were going to have to look within ourselves and ask 
how much oil are we using 
skimmers including the 425foot vaidogubsky pledged to the 
cleanup effort by the soviet government have run into mechanical 
problems trying to gather the heavy windwhipped crude 
the soviet crew on sunday adjusted its equipment and hoped to 
resume sucking up oil gathered at gore point a spectacular rock 
outcropping in the gulf of alaska 
department of environmental conservation commissioner dennis 
kelso said his agency believes oil still may be leaking from the 
exxon valdez which is being repaired in prince william sound 
exxon and the coast guard said no oil is leaking 
kelsos agency has asked the coast guard for permission to 
anchor a vessel next to the tanker to test the water and determine 
the source of an oily sheen

amid the boutiques and trendy eateries of 20th 
century lower manhattan george washington stepped off a barge 
sunday to commence a week of events marking the 200th anniversary 
of his inauguration 
the washington lookalike was really philadelphia actor william 
sommerfield who was greeted at south street seaport by cannon fire 
and a crowd of more than 3000 as a marching band played everything 
from irving berlin to michael jackson 
he looks just like him said kris visconti 14 
mayor edward i koch was there too he welcomed george 
washington reincarnated back to new york city and presented him 
with a framed proclamation 
sommerfield spoke briefly to the crowd through one of those 
newfangled microphones that did not exist the first time around 
i cannot conceal the painful emotion i feel at being called upon 
to serve as president of the united states he told them 
he had crossed the choppy harbor from elizabeth new jersey in 
a small wooden barge a replica of a 17thcentury vessel which was 
covered with a red canopy and decorated with garlands of evergreen 
in new jersey earlier in the day sommerfield greeted 200 newly 
naturalized citizens and encountered a bit of civil unrest from 
modern residents of the colonial city of elizabethtown 
nearly 1500 people a third of them protesting recent municipal 
layoffs lined a main elizabeth intersection in windy 40degree 
weather to catch a glimpse of the mock revolutionary war hero 
the new citizens many of them asian and hispanic were sworn in 
outside the union county courthouse which was draped in red white 
and blue bunting and colonial american flags 
two hundred years ago to this date the presidentelect of our 
nation arrived in elizabethtown new jersey said superior court 
judge edward w beglin jr there is a bridge from those events to 
today that will by symbolized in these proceedings by the 
acceptation of 200 citizens into citizenship 
across the street from the reenactment about 500 policemen 
firefighters and their families demonstrated their anger over 
recent layoffs in the financially ailing city 
mayor thomas dunn who was absent from sundays festivities on 
april 14 laid off 144 police officers firefighters and emergency 
medical technicians and 81 other municipal employees dunn said the 
layoffs were necessary to close a 26 million deficit caused by a 
lack of state aid 
sommerfield began his reenactment of the inaugural voyage in 
mount vernon va last sunday the carriage the actor was riding 
in broke down less than 100 feet into the 250mile trek to new york 
city however and he had to continue on by van 
his barge sunday was pulled by a coast guard boat most of the 
way but for photo opportunities in front of the statue of liberty 
and battery park it was propelled by 10 oarsmen 
four oldstyle schooners a replica of the 18thcentury british 
gunboat the hms rose and numerous police and pleasure crafts 
accompanied the barge 
when it arrived at the port washington strode down the dock and 
acknowledged the cheers of the crowd before climbing a platform 
filled with city officials 
twohundred years ago washington actually landed at murrays 
wharf at wall street not south street seaport a few blocks north 
eschewing a fancy coach the real washington strolled up narrow 
wall street bowing and tipping his hat to cheering admirers

guerrillas battled government forces 
in four provinces sunday and fired rockets into the capital the 
government said nearly 280 people were reported killed in the 
fighting including 12 in kabul 
pakistani officials denied a report that their government 
ordered afghan guerrillas to attack the afghan city of jalalabad in 
march 
but diplomatic sources in kabul said there were deep divisions 
within pakistans military and government on whether the moslem 
guerrillas should have attacked the city which government troops 
have successfully defended 
president najib has repeatedly accused pakistan of violating the 
geneva accords that paved the way for the final feb 15 withdrawal 
of soviet forces from afghanistan ending nine years of military 
involvement 
defense minister shahanway tanai in remarks made friday but not 
released by the government until sunday night said the 
governments patience is not endless the pakistani side should 
keep in mind that its soil will come to lie under afghanistans 
rocket strikes 
he said that although pakistan claimed it was not involved in 
the war the direct participation of the pakistani militarists 
organizing the antiafghan aggression is a clearcut reality now 
therefore we reserve ourselves the right to show a similar 
reaction toward the attack of a foreign state 
he said kabul could seek soviet help 
the diplomatic sources said up to 8000 guerrillas have died in 
the battle for jalalabad compared to 2000 government soldiers 
they said the guerrillas who are supported by pakistan and the 
united states were severely outmanned 
an afghan foreign ministry spokesman said at least 265 people 
were killed and 123 injured sunday in jalalabad and three other 
cities 
in addition at least 12 people died and 21 were wounded sunday 
when three rockets slammed into northern kabul official radio 
kabul reported 
the claims could not be independently verified 
the ministry spokesman who refused to be identified further 
said four civilians were killed and 10 people including two 
government soldiers were wounded sunday in jalalabad he said 79 
guerrillas were killed and 51 injured 
guerrillas attacked the southern town of khost injuring two 
civilians sunday he said government forces returned fire killing 
161 insurgents and injuring 10 according to the spokesman 
fourteen more guerrillas died in kandahar and 40 guerrillas and 
four soldiers were injured the spokesman said 
insurgents also fired rockets into herat killing four civilians 
and wounding six he said three guerrillas were killed he added 
in islamabad a pakistan foreign ministry official denied a 
report in the new york times on sunday that pakistan ordered afghan 
guerrillas to attack jalalabad 
the newspaper said islamabad ordered the attack following a 
march 5 meeting that included us ambassador robert oakley 
the attack on jalalabad began march 6 
there is no truth in the report said a senior diplomat in 
the pakistan foreign ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity 
afghans including the guerrillas are very independent 
people they do not take orders from anyone regarding their own 
affairs much less about the conduct of fighting in their 
country the official said 
queries to oakleys office were referred to the office of kent 
obee chief of the us information service in islamabad obee 
refused comment 
prime minister benazir bhutto on a visit to peshawar pakistan 
where the largest rebel groups are headquartered did not repond 
directly to the report but told reporters we want a political 
solution to the afghan issue but we do not want to thrust our will 
on others it is our considered opinion that being an issue of the 
people of afghanistan they should settle it themselves 
afghan guerrilla sources said they were unaware of any such 
meeting march 5 and scoffed at the idea pakistan was in a position 
to issue orders 
diplomats in kabul speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there were disagreements within the military and government in 
pakistan over whether the jalalabad assault was a good idea 
shortly after soviet forces completed their withdrawal from 
afghanistan on feb 15 several rebel commanders said jalalabad 42 
miles from the pakistan border would be their first objective 
but the battle has stalemated 
one diplomat termed the raid a suicide mission he said 
there were 12000 guerrillas around the city compared with 20000 
government soldiers he said insurgents need a 3to1 advantage to 
take the city 
pakistan the united states china and several moslem countries 
back the guerrillas but deny direct involvement in the war

than 1 million making it one of the most powerful in mexico the 
national coordinate claims it represents about half of the unions 
members 
previous administrations tried to ignore the dissidents but the 
salinas administration reacted to the strike by arranging talks 
between the union and coordinate and offered a pay raise of 10 
percent teachers make an average of about 142 per month 
it was not clear what jonguituds resignation meant to the 
strike talks which had been set to resume monday after a weekend 
recess the talks have concentrated on the internal union reforms 
such as free and open local elections 
dissidents say jonguitud who has controlled the union since 
1972 maintained his power on the organization through fraud and 
intimidation and enriched himself while doing virtually nothing to 
improve the lot of teachers 
jonguitud has denied the charges and said he is not a rich man 
jonguitud is closely allied with the governing institutional 
revolutionary party he has been rewarded by the party by being 
elected governor of san luis potosi state and later to the senate 
from a district dominated by the party 
in the union he headed a private cadre called the revolionary 
vanguard and was a permanent adviser to the unions national 
advisory council the presidential statement said he was stepping 
down from both of those posts

leaders of greece and bulgaria on 
sunday signed a 10year economic cooperation agreement and a 
declaration calling for the removal of nuclear and chemical weapons 
from the balkans 
the pacts were signed by president todor zhivkov and greek 
premier andreas papandreou following a onehour meeting in the 
bulgarian border city of khaskovo 
papandreou said the talks centered on the establishment of a 
nuclearfree zone in the balkans and the joint declaration could 
lead to the abolition of all nuclear and chemical weapons in the 
area 
their declaration called on other regional countries including 
turkey romania yugooslavia and albania to sign the agreement 
greece is a member of the north atlantic treaty organization and 
bulgaria belongs to the warsaw pact alliance 
papandreous plane was escorted by four mig23 jet fighters as 
it crossed into bulgarian airspace and then landed at a military 
airport outside khaskovo 
papandreou and zhivkov were greeted by several thousand people 
in khaskovos main square 
the economic agreement calls for increasing the number of joint 
ventures in the two countries and the transfer of technology 
papandreou said a recent decision by bulgaria to begin 
restructuring its economy to allow local companies to negotiate 
directly with foreign businesses instead of through the state 
machinery would facilitate the establishment of joint ventures 
the two countries have set up 10 joint ventures under an 
agreement signed in 1982

the rev evan e mcdonald spoke of gods love and forgiveness in 
his last sermon at golden grove missionary baptist church before 
about 25 parishioners 
he said he had shown those qualities in hiring former neshoba 
county sheriff lawrence rainey as a guard in his security service 
in march 1986 
rainey was charged with civil rights violations in the 1964 
murders which were portrayed in fictional form in the movie 
rainey was acquitted in 1967 of violating their civil rights 
some of the people real close to me said as long as that man 
was working for me there would be no peace in that church i told 
them id leave for peaces sake mcdonald said prior to the 
sermon 
mcdonald a preacher for 17 years at the church in meehan 
outside meridian in eastern mississippi said he had received 
threatening telephone calls his security business is not 
flourishing because potential clients are avoiding it he said 
we teach love we teach forgiveness here are people who 
profess to be christians and they behave like heathens said 
mcdonald who planned to preach twice a month at a church in nearby 
alabama 
hervy spinks of meridian chairman of golden groves deacons 
wouldnt comment on mcdonalds resignation 
thats between him and god he said 
mcdonald said the movie released in january had stirred up 
racial hostilities with some of them directed toward him and his 
mcdonalds security service

rainey 
he was associated with something thats a smear on 
mississippi a scar on the pages of history said the rev 
wardell tanksley

article jan 9 that made note of raineys employment at mcdonalds 
firm 
rainey in february sued orion pictures for 8 million claiming 
his reputation was harmed by the portrayal of the sheriff in the 
moviesheriff stucky the film character is a narrowminded racist 
who helps protect the murderers 
some critics have praised the film directed by briton alan 
parker but activists claim it belittles the role played by blacks 
in the civil rights movement 
rainey said mcdonald had refused his offers to quit the company 
i really hate it for him rainey said i think it will 
finally blow over if they ever quit playing this movie in 
meridian

a piedmont airlines flight preparing 
for takeoff was evacuated sunday when the crew noticed smoke inside 
the plane and at least two passengers were injured officials said 
the two whose injuries were described as minor may have been 
hurt when emergency evacuation chutes did not inflate properly 
officials said other passengers were treated at the scene for 
smoke inhalation 
the pilot had backed up from the jetway at fayetteville regional 
airport readying for a takeoff on a flight to pittsburgh when i 
noticed he made a real abrupt stop said fayetteville city 
attorney robert cogswell a passenger 
the pilot then advised the passengers to evacuate and boy 
everybody just jumped off the plane in a hurry cogswell said 
the boeing 727 had 76 people on board 
a crew member informed the pilot of smoke in the passenger 
compartment said dave shipley spokesman for usair group inc 
which owns piedmont 
the smoke intensified enough that he felt it was prudent to 
stop the airplane and disembark the passengers down the evacuation 
chute he said 
two passengers were taken to cape fear valley hospital for 
observation and treatment of minor back injuries said bob hart a 
supervisor at the cumberland county ambulance service 
shipley said one inflatable chute was punctured by a sharp 
object carried by one of the passengers he said he did not know 
whether a second chute had inflated 
we dont know as yet the exact cause of the smoke there was 
apparently no fire just smoke from something or another shipley

a memorial service marked the second 
anniversary of the collapse of the lambiance plaza on sunday the 
deadline for claims in the accident that left 28 men dead and 
injured 16 others 
survivors and relatives signed a 43 million settlement in 
december with the 40 companies involved in the project the 
apartment building collapsed while under construction on april 23 
1987 
six other workers have filed separate personalinjury claims 
since the settlement said federal judge robert c zampano he 
would not reveal the nature of the new claims but he said the 
deadline for claims expired sunday 
the agreement did not resolve the question of blame although 
investigators said they determined that the method of liftslab 
construction in which precast concrete floors are hoisted into 
place caused the collapse 
the occupational safety and health administration in october 
1987 ordered liftslab companies to make sure their lifting systems 
could bear at least 2 times the expected load 
union officials say the agencys new regulations are 
insufficient 
officials of texstar inc the major liftslab subcontractor at 
lambiance plaza still deny the liftslab system caused the 
accident 
theres no question weve gotten a raw deal and full 
investigation was not done said christopher geckler president 
of the san antonio texas firm 
texstar contributed 3 million to the fund for survivors and 
families of the victims but since has hired a team of engineers 
who geckler says determined the collapse may have been due to a 
faulty foundation 
federal investigators say texstar has no evidence to back its 
claim 
two connecticut congressmen rep christopher shays a 
republican and democratic sen christopher j dodd are working to 
develop safety legislation for the construction industry 
texstar might be bitter but there were 28 men who lost their 
lives and the bottom line is it shouldnt have happened and it 
might not have happened if osha had been more involved shays 
said 
union officials have called for a federal agency to monitor the 
construction industry and criminal prosecution of contractors or 
project owners involved in fatal accidents 
relatives of the victims attended a memorial service sunday at 
st augustine cathedral not far from the site of the accident 
under the settlement the children of the men who died will 
receive a weekly income until they are 30 years old and money for 
college if they choose to go widows get income from annuities 
until they are 62 to 65 years old when they will be eligible for 
social security

a group of black students at wayne state 
university ended their 1weeklong occupation of a campus building 
sunday after administrators promised to beef up the black studies 
program and minority recruitment 
the agreement calls for the university to more than double 
funding of a newly created department of africana studies increase 
the number of black faculty members and offer at least 10 
scholarships to black students 
the protesters who have occupied the helen newberry joy student 
services center since april 12 began leaving the building sunday 
morning university officials also agreed not to arrest any of the 
students or seek any academic reprisals against them 
the last round of negotiations ended about 1230 am sunday 
and the agreement was signed 45 minutes later said university 
spokesman vern foss who declined any further comment 
im happy but i also know that what was done here is not 
necessarily the end of what must be done to correct injustices to 
members of my race said walter boykin one of the protesters and 
a sophomore from detroit he said he planned to relax briefly 
before studying for upcoming final exams 
as many as 100 students originally occupied the building but 
only 40 to 50 were there saturday night and most had left early 
sunday said a campus police officer who declined to be identified 
the building houses offices that handle services including 
financial aid registration and student records it was closed 
during the occupation but was expected to reopen monday morning 
the final settlement covered 13 of the students original 17 
demands foss said the four that were dropped during negotiations 
included a demand that only africans or africanamericans teach 
courses on africana he said 
the college agreed to create 10 fulltime scholarships for black 
students while increasing the number of black faculty members from 
the current 99 to 113 within three years 
the increase would raise the percentage of black wayne state 
faculty members to 87 percent which university officials said was 
three times the national average 
wayne state is an urban campus with about 30000 students 27 
percent of whom are black 
the university also agreed to budget 452500 for the department 
of africana studies in the 198990 school year the center for 
black studies from which the department will be created received 
163000 in the 198889 budget

tanker trucks hauled the last of the 
oiltainted waste water from a leaking barge sunday and workers 
completed the cleanup of the spill in the grand river 
the environmental damage appears to be minimal said roger 
davis of gsx chemical service 
the spill occurred friday when a barge carrying 900000 gallons 
of waste water from an exxon plant in houston buckled in the middle 
while workers were unloading it 
officials said about 10000 gallons of the nonhazardous 
material spilled into the river about 35 miles southwest of baton 
rouge 
gsx land treatment a division of the same firm as gsx chemical 
was being paid to dispose of the waste said to be 90 percent 
water 7 percent alcohol and 3 percent oil 
the barge was to be towed up river to baton rouge where any 
fumes in the compartments would be removed so it can be inspected 
davis said 
he said the simultaneous unloading of tanks on either end of the 
barge apparently had caused it to collapse in the middle rupturing 
the remaining tank 
the spill which occurred on the edge of a large marshland 
called the atchafalaya basin killed some fish but authorities 
said it was quickly contained

neonazi skinheads ended a weekend 
rally sunday without confronting antiracist marchers nearby who 
outnumbered them by more than 10 to 1 
thirty to 40 skinheads gathered at the 20acre rural compound of 
white supremacist richard butler for most of the threeday meeting 
which included a crossburning and lectures by ku klux klansmen 
the only arrest came sunday after two skinheads spun their car 
out of the compound and swerved into a ditch officers handcuffed 
the driver identified as wyatt j brook 19 and charged him with 
driving with a suspended license 
kootenai county sheriffs captain tom dickson said officers 
found a 30caliber carbine rifle and a 12gauge shotgun in the 
cars trunk dickson said officials didnt know whether the 
firearms were legally owned 
on saturday night from a police command post set up in a field 
a halfmile from the compound the lights of torches could be seen 
bobbing through the trees during the crossburning 
shouts of hail victory and the strains of german martial 
music floated through the night air 
about 500 antiracist demonstrators from around the pacific 
northwest marched seven miles down a highway near the compound on 
saturday 
they rallied in a field two miles from butlers compound 
carrying banners proclaiming friends come in all colors and 
northwest nazi homeland never 
they are not just going to go away if we ignore them said 
spencer hamm a black man from spokane wash who found an 8foot 
cross burning in his yard last august we have to march we have 
to oppose them at every turn 
attendance at both the conference and counterdemonstration was 
much lower than predicted 
at one point officials were bracing for up to 250 skinheads and 
up to 2000 marchers 
the small band of stubbleheaded blackjacketed youths who 
showed up is evidence of butlers inability to attract recruits 
local civil rights activists said 
butler 71 has said he envisions the pacific northwest as an 
allwhite homeland but his aryan nations church has been weakened 
by arrests of followers and opposition from activists 
though skinhead links to established hate groups appear to be on 
the rise the level of organization still seems low said tony 
stewart president of the northwest coalition against malicious 
harassment 
this weekend is a good sign that other hate groups have not 
been able to organize and rally the skinheads stewart said 
the coalition was one of several civil rights groups to boycott 
the antiracist march saying it would give the racist groups 
publicity 
idaho state police and kootenai county sheriffs patrol cars 
screened the marchers as they walked down a paved bicycle path 
alongside the northern idaho highway a police helicopter hovered 
overhead 
the marchers represented such groups as gay and lesbian 
activists the washington state rainbow coalition and people 
opposed to south african apartheid 
during the march saturday about two dozen participants in the 
white supremacist gathering goosestepped down the 200foot road 
leading to their compound to meet with reporters earlier they 
canceled a march of their own saying skinheads did not want to 
catch aids from the demonstrators 
a shavenheaded youth who identified himself only as white 
man said the skinhead gathering though small should not be 
taken lightly 
there are hundreds of thousands of racists out there he 
said were the spark that will start the flame 
there are an estimated 2500 to 3000 neonazi skinheads in 30 
states an increase in both numbers and geography since a 1988 
report said marvin stern regional director in seattle for the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
many skinhead organizations do not espouse neonazi beliefs but 
the conference demonstrates rightwing leaders attempts to recruit 
them he said

festive third birthday party monday as she recovered from a slashed 
throat allegedly inflicted by her father 
authorities at petaluma valley hospital planned the celebration 
for carmina salcido and for surviving relatives and hospital staff 
who have cared for her since she was discovered in pajamas 
bleeding and crying for her mother in a sonoma county dump april 15 
her sisters sofia 4 and theresa 1 were found dead nearby on 
the garbage heap their throats slit 
a newspaper reported sunday that contrary to initial accounts 
investigators believe the three girls were the first of salcidos 
victims during the april 14 rampage 
the santa rosa press democrat citing unnamed law enforcement 
sources said salcido slashed his daughters throats about 6 am 
then drove to cotati to kill his motherinlaw and her two 
daughters he returned to his home in nearby boyes hot springs to 
slay his wife and went to grand cru to fatally shoot his coworker 
tracy toovey 
the killing spree ended a few minutes later when salcido shot 
and wounded another worker kenneth butti and tried to shoot 
buttis wife terri the newspaper reported 
it said salcido gave investigators details of the spree while he 
was en route back to sonoma county last thursday 
salcidos daughters werent found until saturday afternoon more 
than 30 hours after he left them at the dump according to the 
newspapers account he was arrested wednesday in mexico and 
deported to the united states 
salcido has said the murderous rampage was triggered by his 
belief that his wife and toovey were having an affair 
he is scheduled to enter a plea to the seven murder charges on 
may 5 
while her father read louis lamour novels under 24hour suicide 
watch at the sonoma county jail carmina was pronounced in good 
condition sunday by hospital spokeswoman fran adams

birthday cards and more than 500 toys from throughout the country

hearts on them and a pink stuffed bear frost said 
surgeons on friday inspected her wound for infection a feeding 
tube inserted in a tracheotomy remains and doctors have not said 
when she will be able to speak 
carmina is expected to remain hospitalized for another four or 
five weeks her grandfather and a few other family members have 
been her only visitors so far 
at funeral services last week her grandfather bob richards 
and three uncles from new york indicated they want the child to 
live with family members when she is released from the hospital 
jail officials meanwhile said a large metal plate has been put 
up to keep other inmates from looking into salcidos cell 
weatherstripping has been applied around the cell door to prevent 
anyone from slipping things inside 
when salcido is moved from his cell for showers exercise or 
court dates the other 50 inmates on the floor are locked down 
until the move is over salcido is always escorted by at least 
three guards the officials said 
jail official todd hart said salcidos only requests as of late 
saturday had been for a toothbrush cigarettes his next court date 
and something to read 
hes been real quiet hart said 
at grand cru winery business resumed saturday for the first 
time since the slayings 
tasting room manager alan wastell said he was uncomfortable with 
accounts that portrayed salcido as a homicidal maniac prior to 
the spree 
they want to believe that he looked and acted like a monster 
at all times wastell said as disturbing as the thought may 
be he was not a raving lunatic

a sheriff is relying on two psychics to 
lead him to the site where serial killer ted bundy allegedly buried 
a victim following fruitless searches for her remains and those of 
two other teenaged girls 
its a long shot but really thats all weve got left said 
wayne county sheriff kerry ekker im not prepared to rule them 
out because once in a while they have success stories 
in his eleventhhour confession before execution in floridas 
electric chair jan 24 bundy said he had buried nancy wilcox near 
capital reef national park some 200 miles south of salt lake city 
in wayne county 
bones and bits of clothing were recovered in march just outside 
the boundaries of capitol reef national park about 200 miles south 
of salt lake city but they turned out to be animal bones ekker 
said bundy also said he buried debi kent and sue curtis in 
isolated areas about 150 miles south of salt lake city 
frustrated in their searches for the bodies of the three girls 
ekker and officials in two other southern utah counties are 
beginning to wonder if bundy was getting in a last morbid laugh 
ms wilcox and ms kent disappeared from the salt lake city area 
in 1974 both were 17 at the time ms curtis was 15 when she 
disappeared in 1975 from a conference at brigham young university 
in provo 
weve dug up all kinds of animal bones but we havent found 
anything human said acting carbon county sheriff jim robertson 
who is searching for ms curtis remains 
bundy executed for the 1978 murder of 12yearold kimberly 
leach confessed to dozens of killings in several western states 
including eight in utah he identified only three of the utah 
victims 
in colorado investigators are searching for the body of julie 
cunningham a ski instructor who disappeared in 1975 and whom bundy 
claims he killed 
robertson questioned the credibility of bundys lastminute 
burial confessions 
it just seems to me his history is the kind that he left a lot 
of people dangling even as he went to the chair said 
robertson bundy may have been getting the last laugh he said 
in sanpete county sheriff wallace buchanan said officials were 
ready to look for the body of ms kent in an area that previously 
had been covered in snow 
buchanan said his office also had received many calls regarding 
bundy trees carved with bundys name or initials some may have 
been carved by joking hikers buchanan said 
the fbi held a weeklong conference in quantico va in 
february about 20 law enforcement officers from around the country 
analyzed bundys confession and tried to help each other determine 
which victims could be tied to the serial killer

the scarred battleship uss iowa made a 
somber return sunday to its home port where about 3000 family 
members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an 
explosion that killed 47 sailors 
sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the 
huge vessel docked at the norfolk naval bases pier 5 at 541 pm 
just one minute later than navy officials had estimated twenty 
minutes later families started filing aboard the ship exchanging 
tearful embraces with the returning sailors 
they wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get 
home said capt steven karalekas 
the explosion wednesday flashed through the iowas no 2 gun 
turret which extends six decks down into the ship there were 11 
survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck loading powder 
from the ships magazines the navy said 
two of the surviving crewmen of no 2 turret stood on top of the 
fireblackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier with full 
crews on the ships two other turrets the navy said 
the no 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion 
occurred facing right with the left and right guns elevated the 
center gun where the blast occurred was depressed 
when the 887foot vessel first appeared there were scattered 
cheers by those on the dock but all remained silent as the ship 
pulled into the pier the somber mood was heightened by the lack of 
bands and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked 
adm powell carter commander in chief of the atlantic fleet 
was on the dock to greet the vessel as it docked three marines 
raised a flag to halfmast at the stern of the ship 
the navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families 
and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the 
crewmen 
the violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an 
amateur videotape released by the navy on sunday the tape was made 
by an officer on the bridge of the iowa who wanted to record the 
firing of the big guns 
the detonation which appears to blast away the gasketlike 
rubber bloomers that seal the turrets gun slits is followed 
by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of 
the gunhouse 
the videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters 
spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret 
throughout the norfolk area churches dedicated prayers sunday 
morning to the families of iowa crewmen 
we have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way said cmdr 
john l fitzgerald a chaplain in a service at the norfolk naval 
air station our faith helps us to handle what science cannot 
answer the mystery of death 
a red rose a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book 
containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar 
fitzgerald said the iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost 
soviet submarine put political differences aside and unite the 
human family as one 
on monday morning president bush will lead a memorial service 
in a base hangar that can accommodate 3000 people 
the families of the victims were invited but navy officials 
said they did not know how many would attend none of the victims 
listed the norfolk area as their hometown 
the explosion occurred during exercises off puerto rico the 
pentagon said it happened before the middle 16inch gun of the 
threegun turret had been fired the guns the largest on any ship 
at sea use six 110pound bags of black powder to fire a 
2700pound projectile up to 23 miles 
the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion 
which damaged only the inside of the turret 
but navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the 
blast found the no 2 guns breech open and undamaged with the 
practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there the 
new york times reported sunday 
this indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were 
still being loaded into the gun the times said citing 
unidentified sources 
navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the 
bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the 
newspaper said they said flame and hot gases from the blast went 
down the hoist to the lowest deck if the transfer of powder to the 
guns had been complete the hoist would have been sealed off 
the iowa and its sister ships the battleships missouri new 
jersey and wisconsin were commissioned during world war ii and 
mothballed after the korean war they were recommissioned by the 
reagan administration in the 1980s 
defense secretary dick cheney said sunday that the 
administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet 
despite the explosion 
they are effective they were relatively cheap to bring back 
into the service compared to new ships they are good cruise 
missile platforms so i think they do have a role to play cheney 
said on nbcs meet the press 
critics have charged that the battleships 16inch guns are 
antiquated and dangerous gunners say they are among the most 
accurate available

a jumbo jet approaching john f kennedy airport 
missed a commuter plane by 100 feet sunday while in another 
incident a commercial jet reported coming within 400 yards of a 
private plane near a suburban airport 
in the first near miss a twa 747 jumbo jet on a flight from 
london came within 100 feet of a turboprop commuter plane said 
kathleen bergen a spokeswoman for the federal aviation 
administration 
both planes were being monitored by air traffic controllers and 
preparing to land at kennedy she said 
about 45 minutes later a pan american jet en route from 
laguardia airport to boston experienced a near miss with a small 
cessna plane near the westchester country airport she said 
no injuries were reported in either incident and bergen said 
they were totally unrelated and happened miles and miles apart 
she said investigators did not know yet how the planes drew so 
close to each other 
westchester county airport is about 35 miles north of kennedy 
airport 
in the earlier incident twa flight 701 from londons heathrow 
airport was flying at 1900 feet about five miles southeast of 
kennedy when the captain reported that pocono flight 7636 passed 
him about 100 feet above and to the right bergen said 
a nearby air france jet also was preparing to land at the same 
time bergen said the pocono craft was instructed to land after 
the twa plane which was scheduled behind air france she said the 
air france jet had just landed when the pocono plane flew by the 
twa jet bergen said 
she declined comment when asked if the pocono pilot may have 
confused the twa and the air france jets 
the commuter craft was a merlin sw4 a turboprop that carries 
about 16 passengers she said bergen did not know where the pocono 
flight originated and there was no answer at the airlines queens 
office 
bergen said the twa pilot did not take any evasive action the 
pocono flight was ordered to abort its landing so the twa flight 
could land first 
this is very unusual for the new york area said bergen 
the second incident occurred about 10 miles southeast of 
westchester county airport at an elevation of 10500 feet bergen 
said it involved pan am shuttle flight 542 a 727 and a small 
cessna 414 bound for bedford pa that was not under the direction 
of traffic controllers she said 
the 727 had been cleared by air controllers to climb to 17000 
feet and had just passed 10000 feet when the pan am captain took 
evasive action to avoid the cessna which can seat between four to 
six people bergen said 
the pan am captain reported that the cessna was 400 yards 
away and had a vertical separation of 200 feet said bergen 
adding that the captain did not say if the cessna was approaching 
below or above the commercial jet 
the pan am captain turned and climbed in the opposite 
direction to avoid the cessna bergen said 
she said the captains reports will be studied along with audio 
tapes and other materials to determine who erred

university students throughout beijing marched on 
campuses monday to begin an indefinite class boycott one of a 
series of protests to press for democratic reform 
virtually all of beijing universitys 15000 students appeared 
to be taking part students at at least four other universities 
also participated 
at beijing normal university students waving their department 
flags marched around campus chanting boycott class 
leaders said they believed there was total participation in the 
boycott at beijing university a few dozen students were sitting 
in one classroom but said they were not there to attend class 
our slogan is boycott classes but dont boycott studies 
several students said 
a student wearing a red armband identifying him as one of the 
strike organizers said all the students are taking part in the 
strike 
he said however that if any student wants to go to class the 
strikers will only use democratic methods not force to 
persuade them to boycott 
if our goal is democracy we must solve our problems 
democratically he said 
a poster in one classroom building said teachers please 
understand and support our strike i love my teachers but i love 
the truth more 
posters supporting the strike and proclaiming the student 
demands for democratic reforms covered many buildings in the center 
of campus sheets of notepad paper bearing the character strike 
were plastered over classroom windows 
one poster an appeal to the national peoples congress or 
parliament and the chinese peoples political consultative 
conference an advisory body for tolerance of the student actions 
was signed by 143 teachers

government building scores were reported hurt 
the unrest was perhaps the most violent since demonstrations 
began april 15 when the death of reformer hu yaobang stirred 
antigovernment sentiments and an organized protest campaign by 
university students 
many students also called for premier li pengs resignation and 
hung posters on campus mocking him 
the official xinhua news agency said mondays peoples daily 
newspaper contained a commentary that warned social turmoil can 
only do good to an extremely small number of people with ulterior 
motives 
about 150000 people joined saturday in one of the biggest 
protests in communist chinas 40year history holding a 15hour 
rally at beijings tiananmen square authorities allowed the 
protest but students alleged sunday that police beat several and

an opposition leader on sunday blasted 
as inadequate a new communications law that abolishes prior 
censorship and indefinite closures of the print and broadcast media 
it is abominable from every point of view erick ramirez 
president of the opposition social christian party said in a 
telephone interview it buries whatever vestige of press freedom 
exists in nicarauga 
ramirez said the new law touted as one of president daniel 
ortegas new democratic reforms fails to authorize private 
television stations something opposition groups have long sought 
instead the new law guarantees equal access to social and 
political groups on governmentrun television 
the association of independent journalists of nicaragua also 
criticized the new law saying it would prevent free expression 
the sandinistacontrolled national assembly approved the law 
friday and ortega signed it into law on saturday 
before leaving for a twoweek tour of europe on saturday ortega 
proclaimed in no other country in the region are there more 
guarantees for jouranlists than in nicargua the rest of central 
america he said has exercised terrorism against journalism 
ortega introduced the law as part of democratic reforms he 
promised to institute in his country following a meeting of the 
five central american presidents in el salvador in feburary 
he also agreed to move up presidential elections by 10 months 
to february 1990 
the presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala costa rica 
and honduras additionally agreed to come up by midmay with a plan 
for dismantling the nicarguan rebel force known as the contras 
about 11000 contra rebels along with their families live in 
honduran camps near the nicaraguan border 
the new law establishes sanctions for disseminating information 
deemed contrary to the interests of the state for altering 
government press releases communiques and other statments and for 
the transmission diffusion publication or projection of 
injurious defamatory or false information 
although it abolishes prior censorship and indefinte closure of 
newspapers and broadcast stations the new law will allow the 
interior ministry to order closures of up to four days and gives it 
the power to order an offending broadcaster or publisher to issue a 
retraction clarification or correction 
broadcasters and publishers will have the right to a hearing 
before sanctions are applied 
under previous practice the ministry had the power to order 
indefinite shutdowns without hearings 
the opposition daily la prensa said in an editorial this 
weekend ortega also did not fulfill his promise to allow private 
television broadcasts in nicaragua condemning for always the 
nicaraguan people to state television that transmit the oretegist 
image every minute 
his law which he dares to describe as the best in central 
america continues to contain grave threats to the excercise of 
liberty of expression in nicargua la prensa said

emilio g segre a nuclear physicist who 
shared the nobel prize in 1959 as codiscoverer of the antiproton 
died of a heart attack while walking near his home it was 
announced sunday he was 84 
segre died saturday near his home in lafayette about 25 miles 
east of san francisco officials at the university of california at 
berkeley said 
professor segre was a scientist of great integity dedication 
and conscience uc berkeley chancellor ira heyman said sunday 
his discoveries will forever rank among the great contributions 
in physics and his life will be a model for the best in science 
segre a faculty member at uc berkeley for almost 50 years and a 
scientist at the universitys lawrence berkeley laboratory with 
fellow berkeley physics professor owen chamberlain accepted the 
nobel prize in 1959 along with coauthors clyde wiegand and thomas 
ypsilantis 
he gained attention in the 1930s for discovering technetium 
element 43 the first artificially produced element and astatine 
element 85 
a pioneer in chemical separation of nuclear isomers segre also 
was the first to observe the zeeman effect in socalled 
forbidden spectra the zeeman effect is the splitting of a 
spectral line when a light source is put in a magnetic field and 
indicates the atoms changed energy levels 
segre became the first student to earn a doctoral degree in 
physics under professor enrico fermis sponsorship at the 
university of rome in 1928 
he was director of the physics laboratory at the university of 
palermo from 1936 to 1938 but he and his first wife were of jewish 
descent and mussolinis racial decrees made it impossible for them 
to remain in italy after 1938 
they came to the united states where segre worked with ernest 
o lawrence and others with cyclotrons that lawrence invented he 
became a group leader at the los alamos laboratory in new mexico 
became a us citizn 1944 and accepted a professorship at uc 
berkeleys physics department in 1946 
segre once recalled his research with chamberlain as they hunted 
for the antiproton that was predicted in earlier physics theory 
they designed a maze through which only antiprotons could pass and 
initially detected just 60 antiprotons 
we had to sort them out and weigh them within much less than a 
millionth of a second he said if we had wanted to have them 
for a longer time we would have had to dig a tunnel in the 
berkeley hills to run after them 
the antiproton is the opposite counterpart to the positively 
charged proton it contains a negative electrical charge and 
opposite magnetic properties to the proton but has the same mass 
although segre retired to emeritus status in 1972 he stayed 
active in research lecturing and writing friends said that in 
recent weeks he had inquired about the possible cold fusion 
discoveries in utah 
segre was a member of the us national academy of sciences was 
decorated with the great cross of merit of the republic of italy 
and was given appointment as physics professor at the university of 
rome in 1974 
he is survived by his wife rosa mines a son claudio a 
history professor at the university of texas at austin daughters 
amelia terkel of tel aviv and fausta walsby of england and five 
grandchildren
