a federal jury monday awarded suffolk county 
228 million in damages from long island lighting co finding that 
lilco and a former executive repeatedly lied to get rate hikes to 
help pay for its shoreham nuclear power plant 
the verdict following a twomonth trial of the countys civil 
racketeering lawsuit against the utility could make lilco liable 
for 18 billion if the trial judge certifies the lawsuit a class 
action on behalf of all ratepayers 
the utility through its attorney michael lesch issued a 
onesentence statement that said the verdict was insupportable 
and that lilco would seek to set it aside or reverse it on appeal 
the sevenmember jury found that lilco and a former president 
wilfred o uhl on three occassions lied to the public service 
commission about the completion schedule of shoreham in order to 
obtain rate hikes 
the jury awarded 76 million in damages to the county for what 
it overpaid on utility costs because of fraudulently obtained rate 
increases in 1978 and 1984 tripled to 228 million under the 
racketeering statue 
the county had sought up to 72 million in damages 
the jury rejected the countys charges that lilco deceived the 
psc in obtaining other rate increases in 1975 1976 1979 and 1981 
it also found no violations by three other former lilco officials 
who were defendants 
i think the jury spoke loud and clearly that lilco had been 
engaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade said kenneth 
mccallion who was the countys lead attorney during the twomonth 
trial 
last week in albany the state legislature let pass by a deadline 
for approving a plan that would keep shoreham closed and give lilco 
5 percent annual rate hikes over the next decade 
lilco has said that while the plan could be revived it would 
proceed toward licensing the plant 
suffolk county executive patrick halpin called the verdict a 
great victory for the county and suffolks ratepayers 
according to testimony at the trial the shoreham plant which is 
located 55 miles east of manhattan had originally been scheduled to 
be in operation in 1978 at a cost of 77 million construction was 
completed in 1985 but the plant was never opened because of public 
opposition 
the county alleged that lilco spent 8 billion in the 
construction of shoreham but lilco says the plant cost 53 billion 
originally the county had wanted to make the suit a class action 
on behalf of all lilco customers but us district judge jack b 
weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started 
after the verdict weinstein said he would now accept a motion 
asking him to certify the class and indicated that if he granted the 
request lilco could be liable for up to 18 billion 
this will have a significant impact on the financial health of 
lilco weinstein said 
lesch the lilco attorney answered it certainly will 
one of the jurors norma spagna of queens said the jurors had 
not believed uhl who was one of 21 witnesses who testified for 
lilco 
i think he lied on the stand said spagna 
uhl who was president of lilco from 1978 to 1984 had denied 
that he lied to state officials about when the construction of 
shoreham would be completed

when it gave birth to western civilization 
the mediterranean was the world ecologists today are calling it a 
paradise lost 
ravaged by man over the centuries the face of the mediterranean 
has been scarred lush forests felled wildlife silenced 
mineralrich soil long gone aquamarine currents fouled by oil 
slicks 
but some of the regions leading thinkers are trying to 
rediscover a mediterranean identity through the only common bond 
they can find a determination to save whats left of the 
mediterraneans environment 
its a region whose contribution is acknowledged by the world 
but whose future lies in doubt wrote serge antoine international 
relations adviser for frances environment ministry 
antoine among 60 delegates who discussed the state of the 
mediterranean at a recent international conference in cairo 
sponsored by the romebased aspen institute italia called on the 
regions 18 countries to unite their cultural and political wills to 
shape a brighter future 
the institute a branch of the aspen institute for humanistic 
studies of aspen colo brings together political economic and 
cultural leaders to discuss current issues 
a clear message emerged from the conference the only way to 
solve environmental social economic and political ills of the area 
is to find common ground uniting the diverse cultures tied by 
geography to the mediterranean sea 
theres only one issue that can join us now and thats the 
environment gianni de michelis italys deputy prime minister and 
president of the italian institute said in an interview 
despite the vast differences between industrialized countries 
that border the northern mediterranean and lessdeveloped countries 
bordering the south everybody agrees we have to do something about 
the environment its the only rallying point we have the one issue 
public opinion can use to force politicians to act 
delegates from europe north africa and the united states said 
the mediterranean region has greater potential for environmental 
progress than most because of its manageable size and historical 
links its countries share 
they agreed however that despite the work of numerous local and 
international agencies governments arent doing enough 
a major topic of the conference was the mediterranean action 
plan a survey dating from the mid1970s seeking to balance the 
areas environmental and development needs through the first quarter 
of the 21st century 
the mediterranean basin is among the most developed regions in 
the world despite its varied cultures but its population and 
industry are shifting rapidly toward its fragile coastlines tourism 
is increasing greatly throughout the region and almost half the 
millions of annual tourists remain along the coast 
the basin has 29000 miles of seacoast only 40 percent of which 
is flat usable land 
additionally population is growing unevenly declining slightly 
along the mediterraneans richer northern tier and expanding rapidly 
in the poorer south 
experts warned of threats from other sources ships dumping toxic 
or hazardous wastes deforestation on both sides of the 
mediterranean and the lack of effort to find alternatives to 
fossilbased fuels that pollute the atmosphere 
one proposal to spur mediterranean recovery suggested by atef m 
ebeid egypts minister of cabinet affairs calls for the setting up 
of a green belt along the entire mediterranean 
but us delegate peter thacher of washingtons world resources 
institute while praising the virtues of the concept cautioned that 
national politics can and often do override environmental 
considerations 
he said the only way to achieve necessary international 
cooperation for a project of the scale of the green belt 
proposal would be under the flag of the united nations 
whatever is done delegates to the conference agreed that the 
need to do something is acute

the philippine military admits that thousands of 
villages are heavily influenced by communist rebels associated 
press reporter yasmin arquiza visited one such village and here is 
her report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with its huts 
scattered along steep slopes the village looks no different from 
hundreds of others in the rugged cordillera range but here village 
elders owe their allegiance to communist rebels 
residents say they began cooperating with the new peoples army 
to fill a void created by the lack of services from the central 
government in manila about 200 miles to the south 
members of the village council granted an interview to the 
associated press on condition that the name of the settlement not be 
published to avoid military reprisal 
the village in kalingaapayo province is near the town of 
balbalan and is among 10 in the area which is virtually controlled 
by the new peoples army the military admits that up to 20 percent 
of the 40000 villages nationwide are influenced by the 
insurgents 
in this village and several others nearby rebel influence 
amounts to virtual control 
experiences of the villagers offer insights into why the 
insurgency persists despite the 1986 ouster of president ferdinand 
marcos and the rise of a democratic administration under corazon 
aquino 
the 34yearold village leader who would not give his name 
traced the origin of the rebel government to a lack of confidence in 
the marcos administration 
he said villagers whose main contact with the central government 
is an occasional military patrol remain unconvinced that the new 
administration in manila is significantly different from the old 
we had no trust in our elected officials and we could not work 
in the fields due to intense militarization said the leader we 
wanted to find out the best way to solve these problems 
communist guerrillas began operating in the cordillera mountains 
of northern luzon in the early 1970s but arrived in this village 
only in 1982 more than three years before marcos was ousted 
the rebels conducted political seminars taught villagers to read 
and write and then established camps nearby they improved living 
conditions by running off thieves and campaigning against alcohol 
and gambling all of which had flourished due to inadequate police 
protection 
those who did not want to cooperate with the rebels were warned 
to leave on nov 14 1987 the rebels de facto control was 
formalized when residents nominated and elected a rival village 
council which works with the local insurgent commander 
the rebel village council operates in tandem with the 
governments sevenmember local committee in some cases residents 
serve openly on the government council and secretly on the rebel 
panel 
the village leader said the presence of rebel sympathizers on the 
official town council enables the underground committee to control 
and monitor funds earmarked for the area by provincial and national 
governments 
the mayor is reduced to a figurehead said a local new 
peoples army leader who gave his name only as ka comrade 
dangkas 
the village leader boasted that the underground administration 
has been more successful in implementing development projects he 
recalled that in 1979 local officials of marcos new society 
movement party wasted so much money in constructing a school that 
there was not enough cash left to build a floor 
by contrast the village leader said the rebel council has 
encouraged residents to plant vegetables to reduce their economic 
dependence on coffee production 
residents say they have accepted the authority of the shadow 
government because its members were chosen freely by secret ballot 
members of the official council are largely holdovers from the 
marcos administration 
the aquino government plans to hold its first village election 
next march 
still the rebels hold on the village faces threats from the 
military and the rival cordillera peoples liberation army which 
broke with the new peoples army in 1986 and cooperates with the 
government 
a few months ago the rival rebels killed a village council 
member and another civilian in a nearby municipality because they 
were suspected of aiding the communists the village leader said 
he also said the rebels has tried to flush out communist 
supporters in his village 
everybody knows who we are the village leader said of rebel 
supporters but so far he said villagers have refused to expose 
them

when president mikhail s gorbachev meets cuban 
leader fidel castro later this week soviet experts expect him to 
try to persuade the veteran revolutionary that its past time for 
castro to draw in his horns 
we are not going to worsen our relations with cuba said one 
latin american specialist but gorbachev is a very persuasive man 
and he will try to explain his intentions 
the trip to cuba to mark the 30th anniversary of the revolution 
that brought castro to power has been in the planning stages at 
least since last june 
but it assumed a flavor more palatable to washington two weeks 
ago when gorbachev disclosed the visit would be sandwiched between 
a trip to new york to address the united nations and meet with 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush and a stop in 
britain for talks with prime minister margaret thatcher and a 
meeting with queen elizabeth ii 
the soviet expert who agreed to discuss sovietcuban relations 
on condition he not be identified said castros regime has become 
not only a financial burden at a time when the kremlin is trying to 
divert resources to its domestic needs but a foreign policy 
liability as well 
the source predicted gorbachev would use his trip to havana to 
offer encouragement to the contadora nations trying to hammer out a 
regional peace settlement in central america and he is expected to 
seek support from castro who has been openly hostile to the soviet 
leaders efforts to encourage individual initiative by enabling 
enterprises to make profits start private cooperatives 
nor has castro been sympathetic to the soviet presidents 
policies encouraging greater openness of expression and a more 
competitive system of electing party and government officials 
gorbachevs new political thinking emphasizes his recognition 
that the soviet union in order to concentrate on improving the lot 
of its own people must disengage from regional trouble spots around 
the world and try to convince the west that moscow no longer poses a 
threat to world security 
the cuban government does not accept the shift in our policy 
the analyst said they are displeased with the way we are trying 
to reconsider our history it upsets our relations with 
revolutionary countries 
and castro is among the few diehard revolutionaries still in 
power he has continued both soviets and western authorities say 
to export revolution pumping aid to the sandinista regime in 
nicaragua sending troops to aid the marxist regime in angola and 
encouraging guerrilla wars elsewhere in the third world 
a fundamental shift in communist ideology as interpreted by 
moscow has left castro out on a limb 
we are now saying human values take precedence over class 
values the soviet expert said we are no longer supporting 
class wars or socialist revolutions in latin america we are not 
against class struggle but we are saying it should not dominate 
international relations we are not going to get involved 
asked if revolutionaries trying to seize power in latin america 
and elsewhere wouldnt feel betrayed by such a policy the source 
said were not betraying their interests theres just no way for 
them to succeed 
latin america is being integrated into the capitalist system 
communists may take part in the democratic process but they should 
not try to fight for power 
the source acknowledged gorbachev was not likely to be that 
specific while in cuba as castros guest 
but the message is that we are standing on the firm ground of 
new political thinking and we are not going to get involved in 
latin america he said beneath the rhetoric will lie the 
thought that if cuba tries to do otherwise it does so alone

no one told richard green it would be easy when 
he took over in march as chancellor of the nations biggest school 
system 
in rapid succession greens school system with nearly 1 million 
students has had to contend with allegations of drug use political 
and sexual payoffs theft of school property and other abuses by 
educators and administrators 
a principal was charged with buying crack on a harlem street 
school officials are alleged to have used cocaine at meetings a 
high school student brought a semiautomatic weapon to class a 
school board member was alleged to have kept a baby grand piano 
belonging to the school in his home and a school aide claimed she 
was transferred against her will after she rejected a board members 
offer to go skinnydipping and make beautiful music together 
those allegations come on top of the systems entrenched 
problems uncooperative legislators high dropout rates drug use 
crumbling buildings disgruntled employees and abandonment of the 
schools by middleclass white students 
then there are such horror stories as elementary classes forced 
to meet in bathrooms because of a lack of classroom space and high 
school students relying on 30yearold textbooks 
here on the toughest turf in american education green 52 has 
responded much as he did during his seven years as school 
superintendent in minneapolis with an approach that is lowkey and 
methodical and a style that is blunt and acerbic 
green has resisted easy answers to difficult problems has 
reacted sharply to those who have criticized him for not moving fast 
enough and has resolutely refused to blow his own horn 
but he did step in and suspend the board of one district in the 
bronx after an investigation turned up evidence of patronage 
extortion and misuse of public money 
during a tv interview broadcast sunday green said he would not 
hesitate to suspend other boards if a report due monday from the 
central board of educations inspector general indicated widespread 
corruption in a district 
asked in august what he considered his greatest accomplishments 
he replied none i havent accomplished anything ive come to 
set the stage for making education work 
while critics have wondered when the play would begin green has 
been busy behind the scenes tinkering with the bureaucracy moving 
to tighten discipline in the schools and negotiating with the 
legislature for greater power over principals and the community 
school boards that runs the citys elementary and middle schools 
green who is paid 150000 a year became the first black 
chancellor of new york citys school system after a bitter selection 
process that pitted him the favorite of the teachers union 
green was the favorite of mayor edward koch and school board 
president robert f wagner jr at greens swearingin koch promised 
green that the mayor and other local officials would be nothing more 
than soldiers in your army 
but koch is nobodys soldier as became clear recently when green 
urged compassion instead of condemnation of the principal charged 
with buying crack 
koch and wagner angrily said green should have made an example of 
the principal green ultimately reversed his stand 
speaking of koch and wagner he said i certainly do 
acknowledge that their perceptions on how to market issues in the 
city may be more advanced than mine 
in fact green has shown an unwillingness to market issues in 
the nations mass media capital and has kept a low profile for most 
of his tenure 
critics say he has missed an opportunity to capture the publics 
interest and focus attention on the schools 
anybody with any brains will know youre not going to turn the 
schools around in a day said school board member edward sadowsky 
but the public requires and has a right to require some signs that 
something is happening 
lately things have been happening but they havent been good 
prosecutors are said to be investigating the shooting death of a 
harlem school board employee the man died in april reportedly just 
before he was to testify before a grand jury investigating 
allegations of corruption against the board 
bronx district attorney paul gentile said his investigators were 
looking into charges that bronx school board members demanded sex in 
exchange for jobs or promotions 
green said in a recent tv interview that those who would write 
his political obituary now are very premature 
i believe even those that have judged me will someday find 
things that we are doing that they can be proud of he said and 
i dont ask them to have patience i ask them to simply keep your 
eye on the prize and thats the children of the city and expect 
the chancellor will be the no 1 cheerleader for them

a twoweekold strike by city employees of 
palermo has left the morgue full newborns unable to leave the 
hospital and traffic more hopeless than ever 
agony of palermo here its forbidden to be born or to die 
read the headline on the frontpage sunday of la repubblica a 
nationwide daily 
among the striking city employees were gravediggers traffic 
police school janitors and clerks in the office that gives out 
birth certificates 
italian news accounts said bodies in coffins were being stacked 
in the morgue during the strike 
the palermo correspondent of il giornale a milan newspaper 
reported that one day last week police had to be called to break up 
an angry crowd of fathers who wanted to register the births of their 
new sons and daughters but who found the office barred because the 
clerks were striking 
the birth certificate problem is more than one for the records 
because italian law forbids the discharge of a newborn from a 
hospital without one la repubblica noted 
with garbage piling up and bathrooms uncleaned schools have been 
forced to close 
the strike centered over how to distribute back pay tied to 
seniority which must be awarded according to a recently made 
contract a court ruled the payments should come in installments 
over a 24month period but employees want it paid over a 12month 
period 
to protest the stalemate six union officials chained themselves 
to each other and were refusing to budge from two sofas in the 
waiting room just outside mayor leoluca orlandos office in city 
hall 
the unionists on friday began a liquidonly fast and vowed to 
stick it out until the workers get their way 
the mayor has pointed out that it might take some time for a 
settlement the city council on saturday night approved the 
12installment plan but orlando was quoted as saying the scheme 
needs the approval of a provincial control commission that is not 
scheduled to meet for several weeks

a case of chicken pox made mick jones cancel this 
falls big audio dynamite tour but jones vows to come back 
tighten up vol 88 is the bands latest album and just play 
music the first single is receiving radio play in the united 
states 
with the group planning to resume touring after the new year 
jones is anxious to regain its previous momentum 
i think its a growing thing a matter of getting people to 
listen changing the way they think i just want to communicate and 
play music said the 33yearold guitarist and songwriter who 
recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown 
manhattan 
i was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable 
he said before canceling the tour 
we were ravaged by the critics but the music wasnt for them 
it was for more it was music with a reason with something to say 
you can put us on page 13 of your paper but you cant ignore us 
because the other stuff is going to whither and die 
that touch of drama should be no surprise coming from jones who 
help lead the british punk movement with the clash a decade ago 
jones was born in london in 1955 a fan of such groups as the 
animals and the kinks he considered rock n roll the most 
exciting thing around but in the 1970s he and many other fans 
grew disillusioned with the direction of rock punk groups began to 
appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of 
mainstream rock and society in general 
like the sex pistols the clash were crude loud angry and 
threatening in short everything they thought rock n roll should 
be it needed to happen said jones we needed it at that 
time 
punk wasnt simply a kind of music it was an attitude jones 
like many who grew up in england in the 60s and 70s felt that the 
more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans 
the musics just as much about the fans he said theyre 
very important they dont want go to the show and just have their 
wallet emptied theyve got tshirts but theyre not anywhere you 
need to take it to the next place 
jones and bassist paul simonon were in the punk group london ss 
before forming the clash in 1976 with singerguitarist joe strummer 
previously a member of the 101ers 
at the time i was just expressing myself the only way i 
could jones said we looked at it as if we had a foot in the 
door and we were going to go in that door there has never been 
anything like it since 
their selftitled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some 
of the most ferocious music ever recorded as one reviewer noted it 
was music that never stops snarling its always threatening to 
blow up in your face 
jones who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected 
letter bombs readily agreed with that assessment 
it was quite a rush he said it sounded beautiful to us 
music should explode it shouldnt be contained and well behaved and 
do what its told 
although the clash went on to record classic albums such as 
give em enough rope and london calling the members of the 
band started feuding and by 1984 the group had broken up 
in the end we ended up writing our own things and sort of 
handing them over it wasnt as much fun 
so jones decided to start fresh he wasnt interested in forming 
a mick jones project he wanted prospective bandmates to think 
of themselves as equals 
ideas was the main word i wanted to have people with good 
ideas and fresh ideas he said i was a good enough musician by 
that time i looked for people who had personality i didnt want it 
to just be me 
but jones couldnt deny who would emerge as the bands leader 
its a dictatorship he said smiling but a benevolent 
dictatorahip i wanted to make it a more democratic thing i try and 
listen to the others 
jones pieced together a new group starting with his friend and 
exclash video director don letts credited with fx and vocals 
he added bassist leo ezee kill williams drummer greg roberts 
was hired through a newspaper ad and jones then brought in 
keyboardist dan donovan who originally came to photograph the band 
the group was named big audio dynamite bad and drew on a 
variety of musical styles notably reggae the first record this 
is big audio dynamite was released in 1985 and eventually went 
gold in britain 
strummer briefly reunited with jones to cowrite and coproduce 
bads next record no 10 upping street with its hit single 
badrock city

a new poll indicates that support among 
west germans for military readiness has sunk to its lowest level in 
26 years with three out of four discounting the soviet bloc as a 
serious security threat 
the survey published sunday in the conservative hamburg weekly 
welt am sonntag also indicated that west germans tend to believe 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev when he talks about reducing 
eastwest tension 
the paper said officials in the defense ministry which it said 
commissioned the survey were shocked by the findings west germany 
located at the front lines of the eastwest struggle traditionally 
has been one of natos strongest supporters 
the poll results reflect a growing sense among west germans 
especially younger people that the government should be focusing 
more on domestic problems such as unemployment 
west germans have become increasingly critical in recent months 
about the presence of allied troops tanks and lowflying aircraft 
in their densely populated country there are 400000 foreign troops 
stationed here 
the bonn government last week announced it plans to cut its own 
training maneuvers by 50 percent beginning in 1990 
welt am sonntag did not explain how it obtained the results of 
the survey the newspaper known to have good connections with the 
government did not say how many people were questioned how the 
survey was conducted how the firm chose respondents nor did it 
give a margin for error 
it said the poll was conducted by the emnid market opinion and 
social research firm based in the northern city of bielefeld the 
associated press telephoned the polling firm but there was no 
answer sunday 
on the question of whether the east bloc poses a military threat 
to the west 75 percent of those questioned chose the response that 
this is not to be taken seriously welt am sonntag reported 
in a 1984 emnid survey just 47 percent said they saw no serious 
threat from their communist european neighbors 
about 51 percent of those questioned this time said the 
government spends too much on defense the newspaper said 
given a list of 17 social concerns to rank by order of 
importance the defense of the federal republic from external 
threats was designated last 
the newspaper said that response indicated the lowest level of 
defensereadiness concern among west germans in the 26 years the 
firm has been conducting such polls 
ranked first in importance for the government was the protection 
and creation of jobs and better protection of the environment was 
the second most important issue according to the poll respondents 
a summer poll indicated 71 percent of west germans have a 
favorable opinion of gorbachev compared with a favorable rating 
of only 41 percent for president reagan 
according to the poll results made public sunday 82 percent said 
they considered the soviet union to be serious about a policy of 
reducing tensions

george bush has taken a somewhat cautious 
approach toward the soviet union that lacks the visceral distaste 
that ronald reagan had for the evil empire at the outset of his 
presidency 
together the incoming and outgoing us presidents will sit down 
for lunch with the soviet leader in new york on wednesday and 
solicit a commitment from him to maintain a fourpart agenda for 
superpower dialogue that gives high priority to human rights and 
arms control 
still bush said recently that he would not try to put his own 
spin on the session in terms of specificity in terms of my 
committing a brand new administration to specifics in arms control 
or anything else im not going to do that he said 
his general approach to moscow and the innovative gorbachev is 
one of caution 
remember the cold war is not over bush told a san francisco 
audience last july 
the leadership of the soviet union is changing but old 
ambitions die hard he said in october systems die hard 
the leaves may be falling but the trees are fundamentally the same 
as much as we welcome the change in the soviet union now is not the 
time to abandon realism about what makes the soviet union move 
bush was on the campaign trail then presidents have a habit of 
changing their rhetoric as well as their policies once in office 
bush who prides himself on his foreign policy experience has 
traveled to 72 countries and been us ambassador to the united 
nations and to china and director of the central intelligence 
agency those jobs and the vice presidency give bush some 
insights into how the soviets operate 
how much a role he played in the reagan administrations gradual 
shift from hostility toward reconciliation remains an open question 
his own record and statements indicate a generally 
middleoftheroad stance 
at least one point seems clear bush like reagan is heartily in 
favor of a further us military buildup those who want to 
abandon the policy of peace through strength in the hopes of 
selfinduced soviet restraint are dead wrong he said in october 
the question is whether bush will have to give ground while 
trying to cope with the us deficit and other economic problems 
former sen john tower considered the frontrunner for defense 
secretary in the bush administration championed reagans defense 
buildup in congress brent scowcroft bushs choice for national 
security adviser has suggested cuts of at least 300 billion from 
the reagan administrations military spending plan for 19901994 
how bush will deal with the deficit and military buildup still is 
uncertain 
scowcroft who was national security adviser to president ford 
is an experienced strategist who is inclined to move slowly in 
working out arms control agreements with moscow 
on the other hand bushs choice for secretary of state james a 
baker iii has little experience in foreign policy and has never 
been to the soviet union like bush he has a reputation for being a 
conservative but not particularly ideological 
still on the negotiating table as bush prepares to take office is 
a prospective treaty to reduce the two powers armories of 
globegirdling missiles bombers and submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
also on bushs agenda chemical and conventional weapons 
bush voted twice in 1983 to break senate ties on bills 
authorizing development of new chemical weapons in the campaign 
however he called for a ban and claimed that it was my issue 
since he took a draft treaty banning such weapons to the geneva 
disarmament conference in 1984 
on the campaign trail bush also advocated cuts in nonnuclear 
forces in europe the north atlantic treaty organization and the 
sovietled warsaw pact are poised to begin negotiations provided 
washington can resolve its differences with france over the role of 
neutral nations and with moscow over human rights 
on reagans prized strategic defense initiative popularly known 
as star wars bush pledged to research and deploy a missile 
defense system as soon as its practical 
the hooker is practical many of the programs critics doubt 
it will ever be sufficiently airtight to justify the enormous cost 
of going ahead

the memories of the soviet surprise at 
reykjavik iceland two years ago are still fresh in the minds of 
us officials as they prepare for wednesdays meeting between 
president reagan george bush and kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
us officials by playing down expectations for the meeting and 
claiming it is not a summit in the traditional sense echo 
similar assertions made two years ago prior to the socalled 
minisummit held in reykjavik 
everyone agrees that the most important reason for this meeting 
is to review where the relationship between the two countries is to 
reflect on the historical strides that we have made in our 
relationship white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said after 
the new york meeting was announced 
but lt gen colin powell reagans national security adviser 
said friday that the us side will be ready if gorbachev springs 
anything 
i think we would be prepared to deal with any surprise that 
they might come up with take it under advisement without feeling 
that were under any pressure during a 2hour lunch period to 
necessarily respond in a substantive way to something that has not 
been anticipated he said 
the icelandic summit was touted as a brief session with the goal 
of making advances in the arms control arena that would pave the way 
for a fullfledged summit later in the year on us soil 
true no noses were bloodied but reagan and gorbachev parted 
company at the windswept hofdi house amid bitter looks and even 
harsher language having wrestled with the earthshaking question of 
ridding the world of the superpower nuclear arsenals 
gorbachev caught the us side off guard by proposing a global 
ban on intercontinental ballistic missiles and the socalled 
nonsummit disintegrated when reagan refused to budge over proposed 
curbs on his star wars missile defense system 
in reykjaviks wake charges flew that reagan and his us team 
had been woefully unprepared to deal with the stunning arms control 
proposals hurled about by gorbachev the white house scurried to 
recoup with thenchief of staff donald t regan rejecting the idea 
that the parley had been a disappointment claiming instead that it 
gave the two leaders a deeper understanding of one another and 
narrowed differences over offensive arms 
yet it took months for the superpower relationship to get back on 
a more productive track leading to the extensive summits in 
washington and moscow and the firstever treaty banning an entire 
class of nuclear weapons 
even though the new york session has been as hastily arranged as 
reykjavik and even though it is also being held with the intent of 
making sure the ussoviet relationship remains stable few 
independent soviet and arms control analysts expect a replay of the 
surprises that sprouted in iceland 
it will not be reykjavik predicted lt gen william odom 
who has recently retired as the head of the national security 
agency i expect it to be a fairly lowkey transitional summit 
with both parties seeking to maintain the present level of 
relations 
odom now a director of national security issues for the 
indianapolisbased hudson institute said neither side wants a 
jolt in relations as a new administration takes over and as 
gorbachev struggles with economic and political turmoil at home 
an evenkeel relationship will be very useful for mr bush and 
even more useful for gorbachev odom said 
alice young coordinator of the soviet studies program at the 
center for strategic and international studies in washington said 
she did not expect gorbachev to spring any surprises on bush and 
reagan because the soviet leader has his own agenda 
hes seeking to solidify the ussoviet relationship he has 
shown himself to be a very impressive leader bush has met him 
before and bush can hold his own against gorbachev she said 
ms young did not entirely discount the chance that gorbachev 
might renew his reykjavik attempts at oneupmanship 
just because hes done it once doesnt mean he wont do it 
again she said although she added that since gorbachev has made 
his mark as a worldclass leader there is little reason now to 
use the session to bully bush the relative new kid on the block 
gorbachev might seek to use the meeting to emphasize his desire 
that the united states and the soviet union move forward on the 
start strategic arms reduction talks and also make a pitch for the 
major steps hes taken in afghanistan said raymond garthoff a 
senior fellow at the brookings institute in washington 
garthoff who specializes in us soviet relations and was a 
onetime delegate to the salt talks said the session appears 
designed not to conclude and not to even conduct much business 
its to touch base and to give both sides a symbolic boost as 
well as add some momentum to the process he said 
both odom and garthoff noted that since gorbachev has other 
events planned for his new york stay he appears interested in 
making an impression beyond the few hours hes spending on 
governors island with reagan and bush leading to even less of a 
chance of a reykjavik confrontation 
with his visit to the metropolitan and his speech at the un 
he wants to show a soviet leader who is interested in american 
culture a leader interested in building a more stable world 
order garthoff said 
i dont know of a case where a soviet leader shows up on 
american soil to punch an american president in the nose it would 
be unprecedented odom said

the ashes of union legend joe hill whats 
left of them 73 years after he was executed by a utah firing squad 
are back in the hands of the heirs to his legacy who are looking 
for a fitting way to dispose of them 
ive got them right here in the safe said brian myers of the 
industrial workers of the world 
the union got the ashes in november from the national archives 
which had held them as part of a file handed over by federal agents 
who had seized them at a post office in chicago 
hill was cremated in chicago after he died before a utah firing 
squad for killing a salt lake city grocery store owner 
his final wish was to have his body taken out of utah and 
cremated with his ashes to be scattered in every state but the one 
that killed him 
the union whose members were known as the wobblies now is 
considered something of a curiosity but it once was regarded as a 
serious threat to the established order during its heyday in the 
first two decades of this century its membership now is about 
onetenth of the 100000 it had around world war i 
after hills death portions of his ashes were mailed throughout 
the country in accordance with his wishes 
one of those envelopes carrying the unions imprint and a 
picture of hill was snagged by a machine in the post office in 1917 
and the contents began to spill out the ashes were considered 
seditious and were seized by federal agents under a world war i 
espionage law 
the archivists who dealt with these records knew they were 
there said jill brett a spokeswoman for the national archives 
they came to us in 1944 so we knew that we had them 
virtually nobody else knew the ashes were there until mention of 
them popped up in a united auto workers union magazine feature on 
strange items kept by the archives myers said from the iwws 
chicago headquarters 
the union asked for them back and after some deliberation the 
archives which is more in the habit of keeping things than giving 
them away decided to part with hills ashes but decided to keep 
the envelope they were found in 
we could certainly turn over the ashes because they werent 
records ms brett said 
the ashes were handed over with little fanfare and were taken 
back to chicago myers said having the ashes in the safe is not as 
spooky as the portrait of hill that hangs above his desk 
the union has formed a committee to decide how to dispose of 
hills ashes and myers says there have been plenty of suggestions 
ranging from silly requests such as they should be injected in 
michael dukakis arm to very heartening requests 
while no decision has been made some ceremony probably will be 
held next may day he said

more uncertainty shrouds the policy that 
presidentelect george bush will pursue in central america than 
perhaps any other foreign policy issue facing the new 
administration according to experts in and out of government 
bush has been sending mixed signals about his intentions telling 
an interviewer in october he absolutely would support a renewal 
of military aid to the nicaraguan contras under certain conditions 
but leaving a different impression in more recent comments 
no less a foe of contra aid than house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said after a postelection meeting with bush that he is 
encouraged to believe that there is a search for a policy that 
will be acceptable both to bush and the congress 
as an example of bushs seeming ambiguity on the issue he said 
in late november that he has worked long and hard for contra aid 
but is now perfectly willing to encourage the peace process if 
it will lead to democracy in nicaragua he left unclear his position 
on military aid to the rebels 
the uncertainty about bushs future course is compounded by the 
absence of hard information on whom bush will select to replace 
president reagans top aide for central america elliott abrams 
there is no shortage of names being mentioned by official and 
unofficial sources one list on capitol hill has 22 candidates on 
it but it is not clear whether any of the names are under serious 
consideration 
beyond that no one on the bush team has been selected to focus 
exclusively on central american issues veteran contra leader adolfo 
calero says he has no idea what the new administration will do 
secretary of statedesignate james baker has been keeping a low 
profile since his appointment nov 9 not wishing to leave the 
impression that he is encroaching on the prerogatives of the 
outgoing administration 
since last march the bulk of the contras have fled nicaragua and 
are living at austere camps on the honduran side of the border 
receiving food clothing and other necessities under a us relief 
program 
no military aid has been sent to the contras since february and 
wright believes that issue is now dead 
but abrams who has been more identified with the contra cause 
than perhaps anyone else in the us government continues to argue 
that contra military pressure on the sandinista government is the 
only path to democracy in nicaragua 
you cant get there without the resistance abrams said 
recently 
a new position paper by the heritage foundation a conservative 
think tank basically endorses abrams view 
written by former sen richard stone dfla a onetime adviser 
on central america to the state department the report urges that 
bush seek military aid for the contras if the sandinista government 
does not dismantle its marxistleninist structure within three 
months after the january inauguration 
but sol linowitz a former ambassador to the organization of 
american states writes in the current issue of foreign affairs 
magazine that the new administration should confine any aid to the 
contras to humanitarian items 
linowitz recommends renewed emphasis on the central american 
peace plan which was signed by the five central american presidents 
in august 1987 
the plan basically calls for nonaggression among the governments 
of central america an end to external support for the contras and 
other insurgencies in the region and respect for political freedoms 
it is considered highly unlikely that bush will ask for contra 
military aid as a first step in dealing with nicaragua the lack of 
congressional support for such a step is apparent 
rep david bonior dmich the chief deputy majority whip says 
the american people have overwhelmingly opposed this policy so 
eventually you would expect this policy to end 
but stone says the contra cause might be revived if the 
sandinistas fail to move toward democracy after being given a 
threemonth trial period by the new administration 
on the other hand paul reichler a washington lawyer who has 
represented the sandinista government for nine years says a 
resumption of contra aid will set fire to the negotiating table 
he maintains that a display of good will by washington would 
underscore sandinista willingness to abide by all the points of the 
central america peace plan including fair elections and respect for 
the sovereignty of neighboring countries 
if we renew the war the sandinistas will simply fight harder 
to defeat the contras reichler says they will obtain more 
weapons from the soviet bloc and will further postpone the 
implementation of full democracy until they win the war

us economic growth will slow dramatically 
next year reflecting weaker consumer spending and rising 
inflationary pressures economists for the countrys major 
corporations predicted today 
members of the national association of business economists said 
presidentelect george bush should make reducing the budget deficit 
his no 1 priority but their gloomy assessment of the economy if it 
comes true would make that job much more difficult 
two out of five of the economists surveyed said the country 
probably will be in a recession by this time next year and an 
overwhelming 88 percent predicted that the next downturn will arrive 
before the end of 1990 
our membership has been fairly consistent over the past year in 
holding to the belief that there will be a recession sometime in the 
1989 or 1990 period said jay woodworth senior economist at 
bankers trust co of new york and president of the association 
the nabe economic outlook based on responses from 200 of the 
groups members was far more pessimistic on economic growth 
interest rates and inflation than the assumptions the reagan 
administration is using to prepare its final budget request to 
congress 
among the groups forecasts 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
will grow an anemic 22 percent next year this compares to the 
administrations forecast of 35 percent gnp growth next year 
through the first nine months of 1988 the economy has been 
expanding at an annual rate of 3 percent 
consumer prices which have been rising at a 46 percent annual 
rate so far this year will climb by 5 percent next year the 
administration is looking for inflation to increase just 37 percent 
in 1989 
interest rates which have been rising will probably peak in 
the first half of 1989 responding to further credit tightening on 
the part of the federal reserve as the central bank moves to dampen 
inflationary pressures thirtyyear bonds will average 95 percent 
next year up from 9 percent this year by contrast the 
administration is looking for interest rates to drop by onehalf 
percentage point 
the assumptions on the economy play a major role in determining 
the size of the federal budget deficit growth and inflation 
estimates affect the size of revenue predictions and interest rate 
forecasts suggest how much the government will have to spend to 
finance the 26 trillion national debt 
the reagan administration using its far more optimistic 
assumptions is projecting a federal deficit of 135 billion in the 
fiscal year that begins next october that means the administration 
is likely to propose just 35 billion in deficit cuts in the budget 
it sends congress on jan 9 to meet the deficit target of 100 
billion called for in the grammrudman balanced budget law 
however woodworth said the business economists believe the 
federal deficit will be much nearer the 1551 billion run up in the 
current fiscal year meaning that the task facing bush to reduce the 
deficit without resorting to higher taxes will be more difficult 
in a survey on policy questions the economists ranked cutting 
the budget deficit through a combination of lower spending and 
higher taxes as the most urgent policy action the bush 
administration should take 
bush has continued to reject calls for higher taxes saying the 
deficit can be reduced through a flexible freeze by which overall 
government growth would be held to the rate of inflation 
while the flexible freeze received support among some economists 
it was also dismissed by a large number of analysts with 46 percent 
ranking it as their lowest priority 
another pressing problem the economists said the bush 
administration must quickly deal with will be how to handle bankrupt 
savings and loan institutions estimated costs of a government 
bailout range from 50 billion to 100 billion 
every month that the insolvent institutions are allowed to 
remain open generates another 15 billion in net losses that sooner 
or later will have to be funded by washington woodworth said 
on other economic questions the business economists predicted 
that consumer spending will grow by just 2 percent next year after 
adjusting for inflation the slowest increase since the current 
recovery began in late 1982 
business investment which shot up by an estimated 101 percent 
this year will slow considerably next year as well to around 43 
percent they said 
the us trade deficit which is expected to narrow to 135 
billion this year after hitting a record 1701 billion last year 
will improve by another 20 billion in 1989 the economists forecast 
the unemployment rate which edged up to 54 percent in november 
could creep up a bit further next year because of the expected 
sluggish growth the economists forecast a jobless rate averaging 
56 percent in 1989

most midwestern and southern farmers believe 
economic times on the farm have grown worse in recent years and 
dont want the government to cut spending for farm programs a view 
that seems certain to run headon into harsh budget realities 
a survey released last week by rural voice a nonprofit policy 
group created by senate agriculture committee chairman patrick 
leahy dvt found that three out of four farmers believe the 
government is spending the right amount or too little on farm 
subsidies 
at the same time outgoing agriculture secretary richard lyng 
predicted that as much as 3 billion of the current 13 billion farm 
program cost will have to be cut next year as part of the 30 
billion or so in cuts needed to help the government reach its 
deficitreduction target 
farm programs and defense spending are the most frequently cited 
targets for cuts when congress returns next month 
the survey of 270 farmers conducted in august and released at a 
capitol hill news conference last week found that while they 
believe government spending on farm programs should not be cut 
nearly three out of five believe the government makes poor use of 
the money it does spend on farmers 
about one in three said the current farm law passed in 1985 is 
effective thirtynine percent said the law either has been not very 
effective or has made matters worse and 25 percent said they did 
not know what its effect has been 
leahy said the survey results indicate we have a clear 
challenge before us farmers are telling us they are not interested 
in bigger programs they want more effective programs which help 
them compete in the world market 
added sen tom daschle dsd a member of the organizations 
board of directors these farmers are saying give us the 
incentive to do better to continue to be the most productive and 
efficient farmers in the world but help us get through these tough 
times 
agriculture department economists speaking at the departments 
annual outlook conference last week projected better times ahead for 
farmers commodity prices will continue to be strong they said 
with recordtying sales of 148 billion to 152 billion forecast 
farmers will be less dependent on direct government subsidies 
the economists said direct federal payments are forecast at 9 
billion to 11 billion reflecting in part the tightening of some 
commodity supplies by this years drought 
the rural voice survey found farmers themselves divided over 
specific policy alternatives as congress begins to consider 
directions for new farm legislation 
half of those surveyed said the government should put more effort 
into nonagricultural industries and jobs in rural areas strong 
majorities favored targeting farm program benefits to small and 
mediumsized family farms 72 percent strengthening regulations on 
pesticide use 74 percent and expanding the conservation reserve to 
reduce use of pesticides 68 percent 
fiftysix percent favored higher pricesupport levels for crops 
and 59 percent said they approve of the use of export subsidies to 
protect us world market share 
a majority 62 percent said they support the gradual elimination 
of all farm subsidies worldwide over a 10year period if all 
countries participate but they narrowly opposed 50 to 42 percent 
unilateral action to end subsidies

defense secretary frank c carlucci 
visited the aircraft carrier uss nimitz and praised its crew for 
keeping last weeks fire on the flight deck from turning into a 
major disaster officials said 
carlucci on the second of a fourday swing through the persian 
gulf region flew by helicopter sunday from oman to the 
nuclearpowered carrier off the coast in the arabian sea 
earlier in the day he visited two omani military installations 
during several hours aboard the 90944ton carrier carlucci was 
shown the location of wednesdays predawn fire that killed two 
sailors and damaged seven aircraft us officials said 
in a videotaped message broadcast on the ships closedcircuit 
system he praised the entire ships efforts in dealing with an 
emergency that could have been much worse one official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity quoted 
carlucci as saying safety drills and intensive training for 
emergencies enabled firefighters to contain the blaze within 20 
minutes on a flight deck where many other aircraft were parked 
investigators are still trying to determine why a 20mm gun on an 
a7e corsair fighterbomber accidentally fired a burst during an 
overhaul igniting a parked a6d tanker plane 
one sailor was killed in the fire and a second died of burns on 
friday in a us military hospital in west germany 
carluccis gulf itinerary also includes stops in bahrain saudi

over the past 18 months conducted its biggest naval operation since 
vietnam

usflagged shipping and help protect gulf sea lanes after the 
iraqiran war escalated in the waterway in mid1987 
the pentagon says the us force still 25 ships will be scaled

the president of the only predominantly black 
medical school founded in the united states this century has emerged 
as a candidate to head the department of health and human services 
in presidentelect george bushs administration 
although there is no indication bush is prepared to move quickly 
on the hhs post the selection of dr louis w sullivan of the 
morehouse school of medicine would be in line with bushs stated 
desire to find qualified blacks for his cabinet 
bushs wife barbara serves on the morehouse board of trustees 
and the vice president himself stood beside sullivan in 1982 when 
the new medical school moved into its first permanent home 
mrs bush delivered congratulations from president reagan at 
ceremonies in 1985 when the atlanta school graduated its first 
fullfledged class of medical students 
another hhs secretary candidate also said to be under active 
consideration is dr monroe trout a doctor and lawyer who serves on 
the morehouse board with mrs bush and was active in republican 
politics in connecticut before moving to california to head a chain 
of nonprofit hospitals 
trout who is white has declined to talk to reporters but has 
acknowledged to friends that he is interested in the job and was in 
washington recently to discuss the possibility with individuals and 
groups with a keen interest in the hhs post although not 
necessarily directly with bush operatives 
for his part sullivan said last week that he has had no contact 
with bush or his transition staff about any job but added that he 
was aware a number of republicans have recommended to bush that he 
be named to the top job at hhs 
the same sources who said sullivan and trout are under active 
consideration said rep willis gradison of ohio ranking republican 
on the ways and means health subcommittee that oversees medicare and 
many other hhs programs remains on the short list 
gradison has declined to discuss his prospects with reporters 
but sources familiar with the congressmans thinking said he is not 
pushing for the job even though he was frequently mentioned for it 
long before bushs election 
gradison was in bushs graduating class at yale but the two were 
not particularly close at the time gradison entered the school when 
he was 16 years old the same year bush enrolled after returning 
from service in world war ii 
while gradison has more detailed knowledge of the workings of 
hhs a huge agency with more than 100000 employees and a budget 
larger than the pentagon there is widespread speculation that bush 
might want to follow the precedent set by reagan with the 
appointment of dr otis r bowen and name another physician to 
succeed him 
bowen a former twotime republican governor of indiana with 
close ties to bush has made clear he wants to return home to tend 
his garden in retirement 
however bush is known to value the country doctors counsel and 
sent his personnel chief to confer privately with bowen last week 
about the same time sources learned that sullivans name had been 
put in play 
another new name that surfaced last week was that of retired navy 
adm james watkins who enhanced his national reputation as chairman 
of the white house aids commission 
watkins was the major force in pushing the commission to 
recommend adoption of federal legislation to ban discrimination 
against people infected with the aids virus a position bush made a 
point of embracing during his campaign even though reagan had 
stopped short of that stance in referring the antidiscrimination 
question to the justice department for study 
social security commissioner dorcas hardy has made no secret of 
her desire for a promotion in a bush administration and has long 
been considered a serious candidate because of her gender and 
familiarity with the department of which the social security 
administration is a part 
however she is more closely identified with reagans 
conservative policies than other oftenmentioned candidates and may 
have been damaged further by recent news stories regarding social 
security activities 
one concerned a lowlevel draft proposal to change the appeals 
process for people denied social security benefits the proposal 
became public before reaching either hardy or her chief deputies for 
review and hardy subsequently disavowed it

presidentelect george bush should substitute 
vouchers for lowincome housing programs when he takes office next 
month according to a report made public today by a conservative 
thinktank with close ties to republican administrations 
housing vouchers are the best general method of assisting 
lowincome americans to obtain housing says the report from the 
heritage foundation since a voucher provides a family with a 
certificate of a given value which can be supplemented as desired 
by family income it gives lowincome americans the freedom to 
choose how much they wish to spend on housing and encourages tenants 
to shop around for the best available unit 
under the voucher program the poor would receive government 
certificates redeemable for rent anywhere they want to live such a 
system the report says would help more than twice as many 
lowincome families using the same amount of government resources 
the report a chapter of a forthcoming book was written by peter 
j ferrara a george mason university law professor and former 
official at the department of housing and urban development it said 
the bush administration should propose funding in fiscal 1990 for 
100000 additional housing vouchers to replace lowincome housing 
policies which subsidize the construction and operation of public 
and private housing projects 
ferrara said the administration should restrict future housing 
construction for the elderly the handicapped and indians on 
reservations 
the recommendations are contained in the 953page book mandate 
for leadership iii policy strategies for the 1990s the first 
such volume was released shortly after the 1980 election and became 
a blueprint for the reagan administration the second was published 
after the 1984 election 
the new book examining hundreds of government policies and 
programs is the most ambitious involving some 400 foundation 
scholars legislative experts from capitol hill and former 
government officials 
in his chapter ferrara said bush also should push for sweeping 
changes in housing laws to enable hundreds of thousands of 
lowincome families to become homeowners 
he said the presidents objective should be to transfer 20 
percent of all public housing units to tenant ownership or 
management by the end of his first term 
currently more than 1 million us families live in public 
housing and the federal government spends some 154 billion a year 
on lowincome housing projects according to ferrara 
turning residents into managers and owners gives them a strong 
personal stake in the properties and the incentive to improve 
maintenance and living conditions he wrote 
ferrara also said the voucher system would help alleviate the 
problem of homelessness by enabling lowincome homeless families to 
obtain housing at a fraction of what it costs the government to 
maintain welfare hotels 
single men and women who are homeless because of mental illness 
alcoholism or drug addiction should be given shelter in community 
mental health centers and treatment clinics for substance abuse he 
said 
in general ferrara said public housing locks poor families 
into generally poor neighborhoods where they and their children 
easily become victims of deterioration violence crime drug 
dealers and other social pathologies

the nuclear regulatory commission is imposing 
new regulations to strengthen protection against possible terrorist 
attacks at facilities handling weaponsgrade nuclear material 
a leading congressional critic however calls the security 
precautions totally inadequate because they apply to only a 
handful of fuel facilities and not to the nations 110 nuclear power 
plants 
in a rule set to take effect dec 12 the nrc said it is amending 
its regulations to strengthen security requirements designed to 
prevent the theft of nuclear material from certain nuclear fuel 
facilities 
the new requirements include 
bolstered security measures to guard against possible use of 
vehicles to break into facilities or cause damage with car or truck 
bombs 
tactical response team exercises to evaluate performance of 
security systems 
night firing practice for guards using all assigned weapons 
thorough searches of personnel and packages entering the 
facilities 
posting of armed guards at nuclear material access control 
points 
an additional physical personnel barrier around a protected 
area 
the requirements initially will affect four nrclicensed 
facilities operated by ga technologies at la jolla calif nuclear 
fuel systems at erwin tenn babcock amp wilcox at lynchburg va 
and united nuclear corp at uncasville conn 
one or two additional facilities may also be affected in the near 
future the nrc said 
an nrc news release said the decision to require enhanced 
protective measures at the fuel facilities is based on a recent 
study that compared nrcs security requirements for strategic 
special nuclear material with the department of energys recently 
upgraded security system for comparable facilities 
the changes are also supported by reviews of safeguards event 
reports regulatory effectiveness reviews licensing actions and 
inspection reports it said 
the nrc plan was sharply criticized by rep sam gejdenson 
dconn chairman of the house interior oversight and investigations 
subcommittee which has held hearings on the threat of sabotage and 
terrorism to commercial nuclear power plants 
its totally inadequate he said while it increases the 
precautions taken at a select few nuclear facilities regulated by 
the nrc it leaves the bulk of our 110 nuclear power plants with a 
standard for protection against terrorist attacks which is totally 
unrealistic 
after two years and more of reviewing the security at nuclear 
facilities i think the nrc frankly hasnt fulfilled its 
responsibilities to the american people and to the nuclear 
community 
gejdenson added we plan to continue an effort to try to get 
the nrc to strengthen the protections for these power facilities if 
not well move with legislation 
alan kuperman issues director for the nuclear control institute 
a washingtonbased public interest group also was critical of the 
nrc move because it doesnt apply to nuclear power plants 
this is certainly a step in the right direction he said 
it could well be adequate as far as theft goes but perhaps the 
greater danger is the threat of radiological sabotage from an attack 
on a reactor 
pointing to the type of massive truck bomb that was used against 
us marines in lebanon kuperman noted that reactor containments 
are built to keep gases in the event of an accident from breaking 
the containment from the inside but theyre not built to withstand 
that much pressure from the outside 
so a large blast even from the perimeter barrier could 
according to a sandia national laboratory study result in 
unacceptable damage to the reactor he said

governors island is an apt setting for a meeting 
between the leaders of the worlds nuclear rivals it bristles with 
fortifications never tested 
two years ago the island was the epicenter of the spectacular 
liberty weekend celebration and on wednesday it will be the scene 
of a meeting between mikhail gorbachev ronald reagan and george 
bush 
having survived the statue of liberty rededication governors 
island is one of the few places on the planet that can regard the 
prospect of a superpower meeting with equanimity 
with its latenight construction and rehearsals its parking 
shortages and its general confusion the statue of liberty 
celebration was a pain heidi balsamo an island resident said 
last week at least this cant be that bad 
harry apicos principal of ps 26 on the island hoped not a 
lot of people here dont want anything like that again 
my own school was adversely affected he added the white 
house press corps was here 
located just off manhattans southern tip in new york harbor the 
173acre island is one of the nations oldest military installations 
and has been a coast guard base since 1966 
over three centuries governors island also has served as a 
quarantine station and a recruiting depot a summer resort and a 
prison an air field and a race track a pheasant preserve and a 
sheep farm until the coast guard arrived it was an army base 
purchased from indians by the dutch in 1634 the islands name 
stems from an act of the new york assembly in 1698 which set it 
aside for the benefit and accommodation of his majestys 
governors 
the 1708 brick manor house where the colonial governors lived is 
the oldest building on the island one of five on the national 
register of historic places 
by the beginning of this century harbor tides had washed away 
about 100 of the islands 170 acres sand dredged from the harbors 
channels and rock excavated from subway construction were used to 
restore the island to roughly its original size 
historic buildings include fort jay a starshaped fortress built 
in 1798 castle williams which along with a similar fort on 
manhattans battery controlled the approach to the east river and 
discouraged a british attack on new york in the war of 1812 and the 
admirals house an imposing brick home with front and rear columned 
porticos which housed the likes of gens winfield scott john j 
pershing and omar bradley 
the island has had less successful residents including hundreds 
of confederate prisoners during the civil war 
today governors island is the coast guards largest 
installation a base from which it conducts operations halfway 
across the atlantic 
despite its location in the midst of the nations busiest harbor 
a sevenminute ferry ride from wall street governors island is also 
a sleepy service town of 4000 residents some of whom dont bother 
to lock their doors 
the island is open to the public for visits only two days a year 
so coast guard personnel and their families have it all to 
themselves the school the bank and the only golf course with a 
manhattan zip code 
the community center is the 16lane bowling alley which has its 
own burger king the only one in new york that serves beer 
you cant have a bowling alley without beer a base official 
once explained thats unamerican 
a taperecorded rendition of the star spangled banner is 
piped across the island each morning to mark the raising of the 
colors and each evening retreat is sounded as the flag is 
lowered 
despite the martial atmosphere the island has never seen combat 
and each spring flowers sprout from the ground at the base of fort 
jays cannons

shorts young couples with children in tow and the elderly in their 
sunday best sought shade or strolled around the giant plaza facing

president roh taewoo named a new 
cabinet today in atonement for the harsh rule of his predecessor 
but the opposition rejected the shakeup and charged that some new 
ministers had supported dictatorship 
by naming kang younghoon prime minister and installing 19 new 
ministers roh was attempting to defuse nationwide furor over the 
government of former president chun doohwan and show his commitment 
to democratic reform 
but the new 23member cabinet consists mainly of appointees from 
the governing democratic justice party there were no dramatic 
changes and key law intelligence and military posts went to 
officials who served under chun 
a government statement said the changes were to put the mind of 
the public at rest following the anxiety created by problems of the 
past era and that the new cabinet would ensure further 
democratic reforms 
roh had promised a shakeup after appealing nov 26 to the nation 
for mercy for chun 
opposition parties said today that roh had not fulfilled promises 
to end ties with chuns authoritarian government and opposition 
leaders voiced doubt about rohs willingness to repudiate chun 
we are surprised that the new cabinet includes persons who 
actively supported dictatorship said lee sangsoo spokesman of 
the main opposition party for peace and democracy 
the reunification democratic party the other main opposition 
party also criticized rohs shuffle we are skeptical about the 
governments intention to liquidate the chun government said 
party spokesman suh chongwon 
opposition leaders said they would oppose the appointment of the 
new prime minister because roh had violated the constitution by 
failing to first consult the national assembly on the choice 
dissident groups which have organized a series of violent 
protests in recent weeks to demand chuns arrest and rohs 
overthrow dismissed the cabinet changes as a deception to continue 
militarybacked rule 
it seemed unlikely the changes would have a major impact on 
public opinion or diminish widespread demands for strong action 
against chun south korean cabinets traditionally have little 
authority and most of the ministers dismissed today were relatively 
unknown 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 and stepped down as president in february went into internal 
exile last month after apologizing to the nation for corruption and 
human rights abuses 
roh also an exgeneral and former chun ally has attempted to 
defuse the crisis over demands for retribution against chun by 
shaking up the government releasing political prisoners and 
compensating victims of chuns rule 
roh who won presidential elections last december against a 
divided opposition is opposed to punishing chun but he must settle 
the crisis without damaging the credibility of his government which 
is still closely identified with chun 
among major appointments lee handong who ran the governing 
under chun was named home minister with control of the police huh 
hyongkoo a former prosecutorgeneral under chun was named justice 
minister and career diplomat choi hojoong was named foreign 
minister 
three ministers from the old cabinet were retained 
despite earlier government hints that a civilian would be named 
to head the key defense ministry former general lee sanghoon was 
picked lee filled top military posts under chun 
roh named olympic games organizer park sehjik to head the 
nations main intelligence agency the agency for national security 
planning park is a former general and was deputy chief of the 
agency under chun 
prime minister kang a relatively unknown lawmaker has served as 
ambassador to britain and the holy see he was forced out of the 
military in 1961 after opposing a military coup headed by former 
president park chunghee 
kang then obtained a doctorate in political science at southern 
california university 
chun who went into exile at a remote buddhist monastery after 
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule has denied any 
personal corruption some of his relatives and associates have been 
covicted of or charged with embezzlement and other crimes 
the main opposition parties have said there can be no question of 
a pardon for chun until after he has cooperated with a major 
national assembly probe into widespread abuses under his 
administration

no more picking mushrooms for lorenzo 
avalos hes got his papers and hes found that the law extending 
amnesty to illegal aliens can mean better pay 
after applying for amnesty and obtaining legal work papers 
avalos quit his 450anhour job picking mushrooms to work at a 
meat packing company where he earns 650 an hour his new job also 
provides him with health benefits for the first time 
they treat me better they pay me better theres more 
opportunity avalos said recently through an interpreter at his 
apartment here 
but for many farmers the competition from other industries and 
the likely need to pay higher wages to former illegal aliens is 
worrisome they also face fines of up to 10000 per worker if they 
continue to employ illegal aliens 
it could be very serious for us very serious said daniel 
boyer president of the pennsylvania state horticultural association 
and owner of amick orchards in johnstown about 70 miles east of 
pittsburgh 
a little more than 17000 migrants go to pennsylvania each year 
for farm work and about 32000 others living in the state do 
seasonal labor in the fields according to art read general counsel 
for friends of farmworkers a nonprofit legal services organization 
most of those farm workers were illegal aliens and have been paid 
at or slightly above the minimum wage of 335 an hour read said 
the immigration act of 1986 allowed illegal alien farm workers to 
apply for amnesty and work permits if they could prove they 
harvested perishable crops for at least 90 days between may 1 1985 
and may 1 1986 
up to 12 million workers nationwide applied by last wednesdays 
deadline including 5000 to 6000 in pennsylvania according to 
jesse peterson chief legalization officer at the immigration and 
naturalization service office in nearby lima 
aliens could have applied for amnesty in other states also in a 
separate phase of the amnesty program that ended in may the ins 
granted temporary residency to about 17 million illegals who said 
they could prove continuous residency in the united states since 
1982 
farmers have relied on illegal aliens to pick apples and peaches 
in southcentral pennsylvania tomatoes and other vegetables in the 
northeast and grapes in the northwest they also pick mushrooms 
yearround in chester and berks counties west and northwest of 
philadelphia 
but with valid work papers many aliens may seek other work with 
improved pay and conditions 
most people are looking for a way to get out of mushroooms 
said avalos who came to the united states from mexico five years 
ago he said he wouldnt have been able to switch jobs without a 
work permit 
in order to keep these people from going into other kinds of 
farm jobs or industry jobs the growers will probably have to pay 
more money to the mushroom workers said charlie r harris 
executive director of the american mushroom institute 
harris said higher mushroom prices recently would give growers a 
cushion to absorb a rise in wages he also said he didnt expect a 
labor shortage 
higher labor costs could put more of a squeeze on financially 
hardpressed orchard owners boyer said 
he said he and other growers will watch what happens with the 
florida orange harvest in the spring and with the tobacco and peach 
crops elsewhere in the south many of those workers migrate north to 
pick apples and peaches in the fall he said 
joseph distefano coordinator for a farmworkers advocacy group 
in kennett square in the states southeast corner said conditions 
for farmworkers would improve only if the new immigration law were 
enforced 
under the law the ins can levy fines on employers from 100 for 
every worker with inadequate paperwork to 10000 per worker if a 
pattern of illegal hiring can be established 
if the law is not enforced the grower will try and get the 
workers who will work the cheapest and in the worst conditions 
well be back to square one distefano said

manufacturers of nightvision goggles 
and pilots who used them contend military officials knew the goggles 
were unsafe for flight according to a published report 
the goggles designed for ground troops and not for flight were 
used by 62 military pilots whose helicopters crashed during the last 
decade killing 134 servicemen the orange county register reported 
sunday 
one instructor said he quit partly because of the goggles 
recent crashes blamed on alleged goggle inadequacies prompted 
calls for a congressional investigation of nightvision goggle 
safety by rep frank mccloskey dind of the house armed services 
committee 
the nightvision goggles electronically amplify moonlight and 
starlight displaying images on two tiny video screens 
military records show that qualified air force marine and army 
pilots blindly flew into mountains power lines trees and other 
aircraft while using the goggles usually on highspeed lowlevel 
flights the newspaper reported 
the goggles are heavy become overpowered by sudden bright 
lights fail to warn pilots of looming clouds that render them 
useless and severely limit peripheral vision the newspaper said 
scotch tape the tube from an empty toilet paper roll on each 
eye and youll know what flying with goggles is like said george 
small an instructor pilot for the army at fort campbell ky who 
retired in november after 20 years of flying in the military 
pentagon officials defended use of the goggles for helicopter 
flights telling the newspaper that combat night missions are 
essential and that use of the devices is often the only way to get 
the job done 
while they have limitations they give us more capabilities 
than we had without them said lt gen charles h pitman deputy 
chief of staff for marine aviation we believe we have to keep 
doing this so we can be ready when the time comes 
pitman said investigators were justified in blaming the 62 
nightvisionrelated crashes that resulted in the 134 deaths on 
pilot error 
if they pilots had followed procedures with each of the 
accidents weve had and used common sense the accidents 
wouldnt have occurred he said 
officials at itt electrooptical products in roanoke va varian 
image tube division in palo alto and other manufacturers of the 
goggles said they have never considered the infantry models suitable 
for flight 
itts position is that we dont endorse generation ii infantry 
goggles for flight applications said jim eder an itt 
nightvision program manager 
i kept saying use these for the mission they were designed for 
driving said former army engineer edward firth who headed 
development of the infantry goggles before retiring in 1978 they 
just dont give you enough to fly at high speeds it was an army 
decision to put them in helicopters they are aware of the risks 
the goggles maximum safe speed limit is 35 mph firth said 
goggle flying was one hairy experience after another said 
clyde emery a retired pilot who taught instructors at fort rucker 
ala and quit in 1981 its one of the reasons i retired we were 
killing people and i wanted to live another 20 or 30 years 
emery said pilots frequently deceived superiors by secretly 
flying wthout goggles during night missions 
night flying gives the united states an enormous edge in combat 
said maj tim mckeever spokesman for the army training and doctrine 
command at fort monroe va 
the russians do not have a very strong nightfighting 
capability either on the ground or in aviation he said they 
are deeply concerned about our nightfighting capability

the migration of two californiabased street gangs 
to denver has caused crack sales to soar and led to five slayings 
this year say authorities who fear the problems will grow 
dont wait another day these kids are recruiting getting 
stronger and more organized warned los angeles gang counselor 
kenneth wheeler 
he told a meeting of denver residents that just two days here 
reminded him of several years ago when los angeles gang woes were 
in their nascent stages 
bernard c parks los angeles deputy police chief said his 
department has the names of 26000 gang members on file more than 
double the number in the 1970s 
denver police point to the arrival of the californiabased gangs 
the crips and the bloods as the main cause of the growing gang 
problem here 
they came here to make money selling crack the byproduct was 
street gangs said police sgt dave dawkins who is specializing 
in denvers gang problem 
about 700 gang members are in denver and they are recruiting two 
or three more daily police said 
the crips and bloods lured by the prospect of untapped markets 
for crack have been moving into other parts of the country the 
gangs depicted in the movie colors have been reported as far 
north as anchorage alaska and as far east as denver 
dawkins estimated that gangrelated crimes are at least 
doubling each year and that 25 percent of the denver gang members 
are from southern california originally 
la gang members said we were easy kind of hicks because we 
werent as hard on them and our methods were a little different 
said dawkins 
the most recent victim of gang slayings here was cameron smith 
18 who was gunned down nov 3 on a sidewalk police said he was 
shot because he was wearing a red cap the color of the bloods 
smith however wasnt a gang member 
had he been just another gang member it might have been 
different said the rev acen phillips who organized a rally 
after smiths death the fact is he was a christian young man and 
he gave his life 
mayor federico pena was outraged by the death blamed on a crips 
member upset over the shooting a day earlier of another crip their 
color is blue 
i am not going to tolerate a situation in which citizens have 
to worry about what color clothing they are wearing for fear of 
being shot pena said 
nearly 100 police officers are assigned to the gang situation 
intensified efforts include coordinating information and efforts 
with other lawenforcement agencies 
pena called for zerotolerance 
that means if theyre caught jaywalking theyre arrested he 
said 
but dawkins said that alone will not deter gang members 
they are kids looking for some kind of recognition they dont 
get at home they gravitate to other kids who have the same 
problem he said 
to help attack the problems roots the salvation army is 
targeting those who might enter gangs and gang members who want 
out said anthony sandoval director of the missionary 
organizations red shield community center 
he said jobs programs and intensely recreational educational 
and spiritual events at the center itself are part of the plan 
by keeping these young people involved we hope to keep them out 
of the streets he said 
one way of killing gangs is by cutting off recruitment said 
the rev leon kelly of the red shield center 
residents also are helping with these programs after smiths 
death church leaders in denver attracted 1500 people to a rally 
phillips with support from 50 churches asked men to become big 
brothers for gang members and women to become prayer leaders 
gang members themselves see only further escalation 
we aint gonna get along said one young gang member who 
refused to give his name ill die a crip ill die straight up

planes loaded with food for hundreds of 
thousands of starving sudanese began shuttling to rebel and 
governmentcontrolled towns as part of a red cross effort to feed 
the hungry 
the first two flights sunday from khartoum to wau 625 miles 
southwest of the capital carried four to five tons of food said 
pierre pont the red cross official in charge of the airlift 
the food was carried in two usmade hercules c130 transport 
planes 
another two c130s carried food from lokichokio kenya to the 
border town of nimule and some other rebelheld towns in south sudan 
the 2 million project financed by the swissbased international 
committee of the red cross is scheduled to last two weeks it will 
involve 28 trips from khartoum to wau 
pont said the airlift is very costly but that most roads are 
mined so planes are the safest way to transport the food 
he said its possible the project will be extended beyond the 
twoweek schedule according to the need of the people and the 
situation there adding that a ceasefire agreement made him 
optimistic the operation would be a success 
c130s will be used to airlift food to wau but light cessna 
aircraft will be used in areas where there are no airstrips pont 
said 
pont said he had assurances from the government and the rebels 
that the operation would go smoothly 
rebels of the predominately christian and animist sudan peoples 
liberation army have been fighting the moslem government for nearly 
six years last month the governing coalition agreed to a 
ceasefire with the rebels 
pont said this agreement had helped in the airlift 
i have the feeling that both sides have now understood relief 
should go to the people whatever be the differences between them we 
have the best conditions ever for a successful operation he said

carlos andres perez the son of a 
coffee grower who grew up to be president is closely identified 
with his countrys best economic times 
but the venezuela he will preside over now is facing far more 
serious economic problems than the nation he headed in 19741979 
when the arab oil embargo propelled this oilproducing nation to 
growth and prosperity 
the charismatic perez triumphed over a conservative rival on 
sunday by mixing populist rhetoric with tireless campaigning 
scheduling eight daily campaign stops during the last seven months 
whether hes a fulltime politician as he calls himself or 
a political animal as others have the balding 6foot1 statesman 
seems to lose half of his 66 years whenever hes in a crowd 
perez is the son of a coffee grower and the 11th of 12 children 
at age 15 he joined the clandestine national democratic party 
which later became democratic action party of romulo betancourt 
perez studied law while working as betancourts personal 
secretary when the democratic action and other democratic parties 
overthrew a military government in 1945 betancourt headed the 
revolutionary junta 
but before he finished law school perez was jailed and then 
exiled with many militants when the new democracy was crushed by a 
1948 military coup led by col marcos perez jimenez 
from exile in colombia cuba and costa rica where he worked at 
the newspaper la republica in san jose perez and other party 
leaders plotted to remove perez jimenez they succeeded in 1958 
when betancourt was elected president a year later perez was 
elected congressman he returned to betancourts side when the 
president selected his protege as interior minister in 1962 at a 
time of increasing domestic guerrilla insurgency 
perez earned a reputation as a tough lawandorder man in 
crushing the movement with force although it was not fully 
eliminated until president rafael caldera who served from 1968 to 
1973 sponsored a successful amnesty program 
by that time perez had become the democratic action partys 
secretarygeneral its candidate for president and in the 1973 
election its fourth democratically elected president 
during the next five years venezuelas income nearly tripled as 
oil prices went through the roof following the arab oil embargo of 
197374 
in 1976 perez made history when he nationalized the foreign oil 
companies operating in venezuela 
perez is credited with having invested many of the incoming 
billions of dollars in developing basic industries such as aluminum 
steel and hydroelectricity 
but he was nearly impeached for his alleged involvement in 
receiving kickbacks of tens of thousands of dollars in the public 
purchase of a refrigerator ship the sierra nevada and left office 
in disgrace despite his acquittal 
the sierra nevada case is still remembered by voters and perez 
main challenger eduardo fernandez used it as an early campaign 
weapon 
but during these times of economic difficulty many voters in 
particular the poor and working classes remember more the 
prosperity full employment and rising living standards of perezs 
first government

the star prosecution witness testimony about 
being beaten by her former livein lover may lead jurors to conclude 
that he also beat the 6yearold illegally adopted girl he is 
accused of killing his lawyer said 
but judge harold rothwax told the jurors in the murder trial of 
disbarred attorney joel steinberg that they were hearing testimony 
from hedda nussbaum solely to gain insight into her state of mind 
when lisa steinberg was fatally injured nov 2 1987 
prosecutors said jurors need to know ms nussbaums state of mind 
at the time so they will understand why she could not have hurt lisa 
herself and why she took no action to help the child 
ms nussbaum was scheduled to resume her testimony today in state 
criminal court where steinberg 47 stands accused of beating lisa 
to death 
defense attorney ira london said he believed the judge was right 
to tell the jurors they could not use ms nussbaums testimony to 
decide steinbergs guilt 
but london said he thought the instruction was futile 
if hedda nussbaum is permitted to testify as to instances of 
physical abuse by joel london said the jury may just conclude 
that if he beat hedda he beat lisa 
she testified last week that steinberg beat starved and 
humiliated her 
in slow cadences punctuated by sighs gulps and sobs ms 
nussbaum said steinberg fed her cocaine cut her off from her 
family brainwashed her into believing she was a cultist who 
hypnotized people and got her fired from her job as a childrens 
book editor at random house 
she also testified that she worshipped steinberg believed he 
had godlike powers and was a healer this she said was in part 
why she did nothing to help lisa as the child lay unconscious on the 
bathroom floor for hours 
ms nussbaum initially was charged in lisas death but the 
charges were dropped after prosecutors said they found she was 
incapable physically and emotionally of hurting or protecting the 
child 
a copy of a letter purportedly written by ms nussbaum about 10 
years ago and obtained by newsweek magazine sheds light on her 
childhood and trouble she had asserting herself 
the letter said that her mother when pregnant with her had 
wanted an abortion the magazine reported this week 
my mother insisted on doing everything for me putting on my 
socks at age 6 for example she said my father on the other 
hand was always saying listen to me im older i know better 
the combination made me feel like i couldnt do anything for myself 
and didnt know anything 
lisa illegally obtained by steinberg the day after she was born 
to an unwed teenager was removed bruised and unconscious from 
steinbergs apartment she died of head injuries nov 5 1987 
ms nussbaum has testified that steinberg admitted to her he 
knocked lisa down and she didnt want to get up about the time 
the prosecution says the fatal blow was struck

carlos andres perez who led a wealthy 
venezuela during the oil boom of the 1970s was reelected president 
after 10 years out of office on a promise to return his debtridden 
country to prosperity 
voters on sunday remembered the good times rather than the 
scandal that almost had perez impeached in his first administration 
the latest returns showed perez of the leftofcenter democratic 
action party with 514 percent of the vote and eduardo fernandez of 
the social christian party with 386 percent the rest of the vote 
was shared by 20 minor party candidates 
the results did not represent all the votes cast but the 
electoral council declared perez the winner after early returns 
perez campaigned with almost messianic fervor on his ability to 
revive the economy of this oilproducing nation despite a volatile 
oil market a charismatic figure popular with the working class 
perez favors tighter state control over the economy fernandez 
favors a freer market 
this is the point of departure for building a bigger venezuela 
the next government must take advantage of our situation to form the 
bases for future growth the presidentelect said on national 
television 
fernandez 48 conceded defeat minutes after the first returns 
were announced 
perez 66 succeeds jaime lusinchi also of the democratic action 
party as venezuelas leader for the next five years 
the constitution limits presidents to a single fiveyear term 
after which they must wait a decade before seeking reelection 
no official tallies were given on the outcome of voting for the 
allnew national congress of 182 deputies and 44 senators but 
private television networks projected the governing party would win 
486 percent and the social christians 263 percent in both houses 
perez first took office in 1974 the year after the arab oil 
embargo sent oil prices soaring and nationalized the countrys oil 
industry 
imports were cheap venezuelans spent millions of dollars 
traveling abroad and employment figures increased as the government 
invested in steel aluminum and hydroelectric projects 
but perez was nearly impeached for his alleged involvement in 
receiving kickbacks in the public purchase of a refrigerator ship 
the sierra nevada and left office in disgrace despite his acquittal 
perez admitted that this time around he faces hard times and 
possibly dissapointing a population that believes in his power to 
reap prosperity 
venezuela depends on oil for 90 percent of its export earnings 
and has seen those earnings slump dramatically in the last few years 
with the fall in oil prices 
perez set as his first task renegotiating with reluctant foreign 
banks mostly us the nations 33 billion debt the 
fourthlargest in latin america after brazil mexico and argentina 
perez believes he is the man to lead a latin american drive to 
set new terms on the regional debt crisis and he promised to meet 
other leaders on the continent to work out negotiations 
some of perezs aides say the presidentelect wants to double 
venezuelas repayment schedule from 14 to 30 years at a fixed 
interest rate 
in addition his aides say he will look for new loans to paper 
over a balance of payments deficit estimated this year at more than 
3 billion 
venezuela paid out more than 60 percent of its foreign earnings 
for its debt this year perez said repayment of the debt under 
present circumstances is obscene 
getting new terms from creditors is crucial to perezs plans to 
deal with poverty levels that have soared in the wake of the fall of 
oil prices at the beginning of the decade 
half of venezuelan workers earn less than 5000 bolivars a 
little more than 300 a month according to the the venezuelan 
workers confederation one of perezs political strongholds the 
confederation says a family of five needs at least 6000 bolivars 
monthly for food alone 
almost half the population lives in substandard housing mostly 
neighborhoods of cardboard and plywood shacks ringing major cities 
officially unemployment stands at 7 percent although along with 
the underemployed the figure rises to about 50 percent according 
to the workers confederation 
voting is mandatory in venezuela but private projections 
estimated that 15 percent of the 9 million eligible voters did not 
cast ballots a high abstention rate was widely predicted because of 
general voter dissatisfaction with both major candidates

two women are seeking to block the 
adoption of their dead sisters six children by a polygamist couple 
despite a state social workers finding that the polygamists are 
highly qualified to be parents 
attorneys were to begin presenting arguments today in the custody 
case hinging on whether people who practice polygamy in violation of 
utah law can be considered proper candidates for adoption 
the state department of social services has an informal policy 
that polygamy is a matter of religion rather than morals and is not 
to be considered when social workers make recommendations in 
adoption cases officials say 
we are dealing with children raised in a fundamentalist home 
being adopted into a fundamentalist home said terry twitchell a 
spokeswoman for the department its no different than a jewish 
child going to a jewish home or a mormon child going to a mormon 
home 
but the attorney for the women trying to block the adoption 
contends the state policy endorses illegal behavior rather than 
tolerating it 
were not talking about enforcement of bigamy statutes said 
the lawyer tim anderson were not talking about the state 
sitting on the fence in this case the state is an accomplice in 
creating an illegal polygamist family relationship 
vaughn and sharane fischer of the polygamous southwestern utah 
community of hildale want to adopt the six children of brenda 
thornton a member of the community who died of cancer in august 
1987 
thorntons children who range from ages 5 to 19 have lived with 
the fischers the past 1 years and are said to want to be adopted by 
them thornton had left a previous polygamous marriage and became 
fischers third wife two months before her death 
thornton signed a document surrendering her children to the 
fischers and the childrens biological father joseph phil 
thornton consented 
but two of brenda thorntons sisters pat and janet johanson 
contend the state cannot award custody to parents who openly 
practice polygamy and intend to teach those beliefs to their 
children 
polygamy was sanctioned by the early mormon church but was banned 
before utah was admitted to statehood however some fundamentalist 
offshoots of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints still 
believe in the practice 
a home study by a state social worker recommends approval of the 
adoptions calling the fischers highly qualified to take care of 
these children and a good family for adoption 
the report mentions that vaughn fischer has another wife katrina 
stubbs in addition to sharane fischer but it does not evaluate the 
relationship and makes no finding of their moral fitness to 
adopt as required by law 
anderson criticized that approach when you or i go to adopt 
it moral fitness is dealt with in depth the larger issue here is 
why does the state have a policy that treats the claims of religious 
fundamentalists differently than you or i or anyone else 
jean nielsen director of the division of family services said 
the overriding factor is the best interests of the children 
that is why an alternative lifestyle does not rule out someone 
from being an adoptive parent she said 
but if that lifestyle is illegal then its probably not in the 
best interests of the child she said 
polygamy is a crime said steven snow an attorney 
representing the fischers but so is adultery and fornication and 
those laws are not enforced either there are matters far more 
important in this case than religious lifestyle

gov roy romer said storage sites for radioactive 
wastes at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant are secure but he 
renewed his threat to close the plant if the federal government 
fails to find other storage sites 
im saying to the federal government get off your duff 
lets go lets get a solution the colorado governor said sunday 
after touring the plant 
waste has been collecting in boxcars and in enclosed facilities 
at the plant since october when idaho gov cecil andrus barred them 
from entering his state for disposal 
romer said he did not want to have to carry out his threat to 
force the closure of the plant which uses plutonium to make 
triggers for nuclear bombs when it reaches storage capacity in 
march or april the plant about 16 miles northwest of denver 
employs about 6000 people 
a permanent federal disposal site is under construction near 
carlsbad nm but is not expected to be ready until june at the 
earliest 
romer and other western governors are to meet with department of 
energy officials dec 16 to discuss the waste storage problem 
romer said one temporary solution he will suggest then is that 
the storage boxcars be placed in nonpopulated areas such as 
military bases under guard he said he might suggest that 
everybody take three cars and keep them three months to give the 
federal government a little more leeway 
romer said the workers he spoke with at the plant feel 
comfortable with their safety measures but he said the storage 
sites could threaten groundwater supplies for neighboring 
municipalities 
the 385acre plant is surrounded by a 6500acre federally owned 
buffer zone but studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium 
contamination have led to promises of an expensive cleanup 
romer said rocky flats officials assured him that 20 million 
would be spent cleaning up the most contaminated storage sites at 
the plant in the next fiscal year 
waste disposal is one of many problems that have beset the energy 
departments nuclear weapons facilities across the country four 
have been partly closed virtually halting atomic arms production

the dollar was lower in early european trading 
today and currency dealers said they expect little movement during a 
week in which no economic indicators are scheduled to be released 
gold prices rose as much as 645 an ounce 
traders said volume has already fallen to its traditional slim 
yearend levels 
the general market view is bearish but if you talk to people 
in the dealing rooms you can hear many different opinions said 
one dealer at a west german bank in frankfurt 
the situation is fairly confused and since we dont expect any

fifty years after it first arrived on broadway 
thornton wilders our town remains an unexpectedly vibrant 
often surprising piece of theater 
thats pretty amazing considering how wellknown the play is 
there probably isnt a drama club high school college playhouse or 
community theater where the story of life in grovers corners nh 
hasnt been told 
that sense of vibrancy permeates a sterling new production of 
our town its the work of the lincoln center theater company 
which opened the play sunday at broadways lyceum theater the 
darkly burnished revival directed by the companys artistic guru 
gregory mosher is straightforward and unsentimental but it doesnt 
sacrifice honest emotion 
our town is a meditation on life quite serious and even 
somber particularly in its third act when it deals with life after 
death but thats not what most people remember about the play 
usually its bathed in nostalgia for the past an uncomplicated 
turnofthe century america where people didnt lock their doors at 
night where the milkman still delivered milk to your doorstep and 
where young lovers could get engaged over a strawberry phosphate at 
the local drug store 
those details are in this production but thats just what they 
are only details in the larger story of life in our town we 
like to know the facts about everybody says the stage manager 
the nameless narrator who tells the story of grovers corners and 
the people who live there its these facts pleasant and 
unpleasant that make the picture whole 
wilder divides his play into three acts the first called 
daily life introduces the characters of our town 
particularly the gibbs and webb families its their children 
george gibbs and emily webb who marry and whose story becomes the 
second act love and marriage 
theres no title for act iii i reckon you can guess what 
thats about says the stage manager it deals with death 
specifically emilys death in childbirth the scenes are played 
simply yet the sparseness of the emotion makes it all the more 
affecting 
mosher has been fastidious in his casting of the large company 
nearly 30 actors in all the narrator is playe here by spalding 
gray gray best known as the author and star of his own monologues 
including swimming to cambodia is a sardonic storyteller 
theres an edge to his performance that slices the sweetness of some 
of the events happening on stage 
penelope ann miller and eric stoltz turn the sometimes cloying 
young lovers into believable human beings miss miller in 
particular handles the transition from innocence to experience with 
a touching directness 
frances conroy james rebhorn roberta maxwell and peter maloney 
are fine as the quartet of parents offering individual portraits in 
roles that are often considered no more than supporting miss conroy 
is eerily effective as the other worldly mrs gibbs who loses all 
interest in what was her life after she has passed on 
mosher also gets strong support from an excellent production 
team jane greenwoods costumes are stylish yet subdued 
monochromatic outfits that dont call attention to themselves yet 
seem exactly right equally commendable is kevin rigdons sensitive 
lighting and douglas steins few chairs and tables strewn across a 
bare playing area 
theres a magical almost mystical quality to this production of 
our town maybe thats because its performed on the large empty 
stage of a broadway theater intricate patterns of pipes cover the 
back brick wall of the lyceum and an enormous system of lights seems 
to climb to the sky 
its a haunting environment for a haunting production told with 
a style and simplicity that reconfirms our towns reputation as 
an american classic 
in other reviews the new york times frank rich pointed to one 
major casting miscalculation spalding grays flip stage manager 
that constantly disrupts the fragile text the firm staging and the 
otherwise wellchosen cast the attempt through mr gray to 
turn the playwright into something hes not derails mr moshers 
our town 
while it would no doubt be sickening to see a stage manager 
resembling the lovable old codgers in winecooler commercials mr 
gray swings too far the other way presenting the narrator as if he 
were a narcissistic newwave raconteur exactly matching the 
storyteller in his own autobiographical performance pieces 
clive barnes of the new york post wrote gray is altogether too 
contemporary and too removed from the middle america of the first 
decades of the century what makes the version glow and what 
will forever be remembered about it are the two young people 
these two lit up the stage with truth honesty and unexpected 
tragedy as a village romeo and juliet 
and howard kissel wrote in the daily news the tone of gregory 
moshers production though full of lively ideas often seems too 
casual it misses the gravity of turnofthecentury life when 
grownups felt compelled to act as such but the play is 
actorproof even nonactorproof since spalding gray as the stage 
manager confirms my feeling that avantegarde performers are not 
really actors

talks to sign a protocol on 
peace for angola and southwest africa could resume this week 
despite south africas sudden exit from peace talks foreign 
minister pik botha was quoted as saying 
cuban angolan and congolese officials were reported angry 
disillusioned and embarrassed by the departure saturday night of 
botha and the south african delegation following four days of talks 
in congo 
the session produced no signed agreement on a procedure for 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola and implementation of 
an independence plan for southwest africa which is ruled by south 
africa 
but botha sounded optimistic sunday in interviews reported by the 
independent south african press association and the governmentrun 
radio south africa 
the process is irreversible he said we continue to 
progress stepbystep the radio quoted him as saying the talks 
could be resumed within a few days and a protocol signing is 
still a possibility 
sapa reported that the south african decision to leave was made 
by president pw botha who had been sent a copy of a draft 
protocol but apparently wanted further discussions 
sapa quoted the foreign minister who is not related to the 
president as saying the talks in brazzaville resulted in some 
progress but the cabinet needed time to assess the situation 
cubas viceminister for foreign affairs ricardo de quesada 
said if the south africans were truly for peace in angola and 
independence in namibia they would not have employed this 
diplomatic ruse namibia is another name for southwest africa 
de quesada said in brazzaville that the diplomats had been so 
close to agreement the text had already been typed and he said the 
south africans insulted everyone 
the major stumbling block for the south africans is the method 
for verifying that the cuban troops which have been supporting the 
marxist government in angola since 1976 withdraw according to an 
agreed schedule 
their departure from southern africa is a necessity as far as 
south africa is concerned because of fears that their presence 
might favor a takeover in southwest africa by the southwest 
african peoples organization 
that group has been fighting more than two decades against south 
african control of southwest africa

the case of the yugoslavian consul general 
who faces money laundering charges may hinge on a judges ruling 
about diplomatic immunity 
defense attorneys said they plan to raise the issue at a pretrial 
hearing but prosecutors maintained sunday that bahrudin bijedic 
lacks the broad immunity protecting diplomats 
bijedic has no diplomatic immunity from these charges because he 
is a consul assistant us attorney paul sarmousakis said he said 
diplomats are covered by a treaty that gives them broader immunity 
but consuls who are named by a country to foster the interests of 
its citizens and businesses in a foreign city can be prosecuted for 
offenses that occur outside their official duties 
bijedic the consul general to chicago was indicted thursday 
with four other men he pleaded innocent sunday before a federal 
magistrate and was released to the yugoslavian acting ambassador on 
150000 bail lbs bank of new york inc the us branch of a 
yugoslavian bank was also indicted 
i expect an apology from the us mass media bijedic said to 
reporters shortly after his arraignment i never violated any 
american law 
bijedic was arrested as the result of a us customs service 
sting operation that tracked at least eight alleged transactions 
totaling nearly 15 million 
the defendants are accused of taking cash given to them by 
undercover agents out of the country depositing it in foreign 
accounts and wiring the money back to us banks under the names of 
phony corporations to hide the moneys origin 
in one instance bijedic provided the others with diplomatic 
stickers that barred us officials from opening the packages of 
money according to the 21count indictment 
vladimir matic yugoslavian charge daffaires at the embassy in 
washington accepted responsibility for bijedic and assured the 
court he will appear for future proceedings matic was acting as 
ambassador because the chief yugoslavian representative was not in 
the country us officials said 
us magistrate tullio leomporra said if bijedic fled 
prosecution matic would be imprisoned and forced to pay the bail 
matic accepted the terms 
michael goode bijedics attorney from chicago said it is too 
soon to predict what kind of defense will be used but he said he 
would raise the issue of diplomatic immunity 
bijedic was released by a federal judge to customs agents and 
brought to philadelphia for the hearing friday 
during the proceedings goode said he and bijedic returned to his 
hotel room from breakfast early sunday to find customs agents 
rifling the mans belongings looking for documents 
several of the documents were placed in a sealed envelope but 
goode argued the search was a violation of bijedics fourth 
amendment rights 
the documents will remain in the sealed envelope in the 
possession of prosecutors until the challenge can be made at future 
hearing before the trial judge assigned to the case leomporra said 
all five men named in the indictment were charged with violating 
currency reporting laws the arms export and control act and 
conspiracy customs officials said 
indicted along with bijedic 52 were vjekoslov spanjol 31 a 
naturalized us citizen from texas vinko mir 54 chairman of lbs 
bank hubert francis cole 44 of carrollton texas and larry card

windows on the upper floors and some were crushed underfoot in the

the predawn earthquake that jarred 
slumbering southern californians involved a fault that caused a 
deadly aftershock a year ago but was of a different type than the 
previous temblor 
saturdays quake which measured 50 on the richter scale was 
centered 10 miles beneath city hall where the raymond hill fault 
intersects an unnamed fault discovered after it caused a 
53magnitude aftershock of the whittier narrows quake last year 
said kate hutton a seismologist at the california institute of 
technology 
because it is an intersection of two faults its been 
difficult to tell which one caused the earthquake she said 
the latest temblor was a strikeslip quake in which two 
plates grind against each other to move the ground horizontally ms 
hutton said 
it contrasted with the vertical motion of the surge quakes 
that marked the 59magnitude whittier temblor on oct 1 1987 that 
quake and its aftershock caused eight deaths and an estimated 358 
million in damage in metropolitan los angeles 
saturdays 338 am quake rattled windows knocked items off 
store shelves and caused at least 32 minor injuries mostly bumps 
and bruises suffered when people tripped or ducked for cover 
authorities said 
a 36yearold burbank man shot himself in the foot when he 
mistook rattling windows for an intruder and an 80yearold atwater 
woman fell and broke her hip nursing supervisors said 
authorities found no damage to city hall or the 66yearold 
100000seat rose bowl said fire capt duncan baird the most 
damage appeared to be at the 200yearold san gabriel mission which 
lost a few bricks police in san gabriel said

on the twa jet testified that hamadi dragged him to the firstclass 
section of the hijacked airliner to question him

if i was a marine 
i said i was a sailor bowen said he said we kill 
marines

face and he had the pistol pointed at my face saying you marine we 
kill marine 
he hamadi indicated that if i didnt cooperate he would 
shoot me bowen said 
bowen told the court he was a member of a team of us navy 
divers traveling aboard the athenstorome flight when it was 
hijacked in june 1985 he said he had been a close friend of robert 
stethem the navy diver who was shot and killed by one of the

myrna loy the saucy nora charles of the thin 
man movies walked into the east room with the aid of a cane 
george burns whose wisecracks have delighted audiences from the 
30s to the 80s walked with a white house aide holding each arm 
they may not be as spry as they were in what president reagan 
called the glory days of hollywood but ms loy 83 and burns 
92 were the toast of washington sunday night 
along with violinist alexander schneider 80 producer roger 
stevens 78 and choreographer alvin ailey 57 they were honored as 
the 1988 recipients of kennedy center honors in the performing arts 
as a performer the lovely and mysterious myrna loy always 
conveyed a sense of great ease and comfort as though she were 
possessed of answers to questions you never even knew you had 
asked reagan said 
the 77yearold president matched wisecracks with burns saying 
one thing i cant figure out is how george manages to appear with 
johnny carson so often im always in bed when hes on 
from the white house the celebration moved to the john f kennedy 
center for the performing arts where presidentelect george bush 
joined those on the stage and in the audience in singing auld lang 
syne in honor of reagan 
the kennedy center honorees join 52 others who have received 
similar recognition since the awards were instituted in 1978

a soldier has a clear feeling that when he raises his weapon the 
activity he faces disperses immediately

even kill if fired from a short distance has provoked international 
criticism israel defends the bullets as an efficient means of riot

the government claimed victory in 
a fourday military revolt but armed renegade troops today remained 
inside an army post a second rebel garrison surrendered to 
government troops early today the official news agency reported 
four people were reported killed in the rebellion the most 
serious threat to president raul alfonsins civilian government 
since it replaced a disgraced military dictatorship five years ago 
the private news agency noticias argentinas said gen isidro 
caceres planned to go to the rebel garrison on the outskirts of the 
capital to disarm troops loyal to col mohamed ali seineldin 
seineldin surrendered at the garrison in villa martelli on 
sunday ending the military crisis 
it was not immediately known how many troops remained inside the 
garrison 
the revolt began thursday when 53 members of an elite coast guard 
unit rebelled they joined an estimated 500 rebels who took over 
part of the suburban campo de mayo base friday the rebels moved to 
villa martelli a day later 
troops at a second rebel garrison the 6th mechanized infantry 
regiment in mercedes 60 miles east of the capital laid down their 
arms early today the official news agency telam said 
telam said the commander of the mercedes group maj hugo 
reinaldo abete told his troops to lay down their arms following 
seineldins surrender 
despite the arrest of their leader the rebels refused to concede 
defeat late sunday 
we dont use the word surrender we use the term 
negotiation one of seineldins followers maj luis alberto 
brun was quoted as saying in an interview with the independent news 
agency noticias argentinas 
brun said they were being allowed to return to their regiments 
president raul alfonsin said sunday that no concessions were made 
to obtain seineldins surrender 
this has been a really important success he told reporters 
there were no concessions of any kind 
it was the third such insurrection in 18 months 
more than 40 civilians and police were hospitalized with wounds 
from rubber and real bullets fired by rebels at villa martelli when 
rock and bottlethrowing demonstrators surged forward 
rebels fired from inside the arsenal and from two cars that sped 
from the scene the government news agency telam reported 
three civilians and a policeman were killed in sundays clash 
radio rivadavia reported 
the army announced later that seineldin had given himself up for 
arrest and that his followers agreed to put down their weapons and 
explosives 
the rebels had demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for 
human rights abuses during the military dictatorships from 1976 to 
1983 amnesty for officers already convicted and better military 
pay and equipment 
one government military officer gen adolfo patricio etcheun 
said he and his men agreed with seineldins demands that loyalist 
troops not take up arms against the rebels 
the reason for the surrender was unclear 
seineldin gave himself up after meeting with army chief lt gen 
jose dante caridi and the noticias argentinas and diarios y 
noticias news agencies said caridi had agreed to a rebel demand that 
he resign 
alfonsin denied this 
on friday four soldiers and a 19yearold woman walking near a 
rebel stronghold were wounded in exchanges of gunfire between loyal 
troops and rebels 
the rebels demands spurred similar military uprisings in april 
1987 and january 1988 
etcheun commander of the 4th infantry paratroop brigade in 
cordoba said the demands are like mine and most of the army 
most argentines were happy that what they perceived to be a 
threat to their 5yearold democracy had been overcome 
democracy triumphed said a message flashed across the screen 
by the five tv stations that had been broadcasting simultaneous news 
of the revolt for nearly 24 hours 
tens of thousands of people had gathered in plazas throughout the 
country to repudiate what they viewed as a threat to the 5yearold 
democracy the military which took power in 1976 returned to the 
barracks in 1983 after its defeat by britain in the falklands war 
and an economic collapse 
rebels demanded a stop to trials of military officers implicated 
in a wave of officially sanctioned terror during military rule a 
government commission said nearly 9000 argentines were arrested by 
security forces and presumed killed 
in december 1985 two former military presidents jorge videla 
and roberto viola were convicted of human rights abuses

sources said the guerrillas had softened their objections to an 
international peace conference on afghanistan 
sources close to the afghan delegation speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the guerrillas agreed to study the proposal for a 
conference but were demanding that islamic nations such as pakistan 
and saudi arabia be allowed to participate 
pakistan is one of the main supporters of the guerrillas in their 
nineyear war with the sovietbacked government in afghanistan the 
guerrillas have their headquarters in pakistan 
the guerrilla delegation was led by burhanuddin rabbani the 
soviet delegation in the saudi arabian mountain resort of taif was 
led by deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov

diplomatic relations with moscow to an end to the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan 
officially saudi arabia maintained a distance from the talks it 
organized in the town 600 miles southwest of the capital riyadh 
prince turki the chief of intelligence set up the talks 
the sources expressed satisfaction at the marked progress 
achieved at the three informal sessions 
the soviets gave what was described as preliminary agreement to 
hand over maps of the minefields laid in areas their troops were 
leaving

good foundation for solving the afghan problem and bringing peace to 
afghanistan said one source

of war reparations the removal of mines and maps of mined areas now

april under which the soviets agreed to withdraw their estimated 
100000 troops from afghanistan by feb 15 they have continued 
military operations against the soviets who suspended the 
withdrawal until a ceasefire is reached half the red army force 
remains in afghanistan 
the two sides agreed that the taif meeting and its outcome does 
not annul the articles of the geneva accord said the sources 
rabbani heads a loose alliance of the seven afghan resistance 
groups based in peshawar pakistan other resistance leaders joined

a commuter train whose driver apparently missed a 
stop signal slammed into the back of another train in tokyo today 
killing two people and injuring 97 police and railway authorities 
said 
shuichiro yamanouchi vice president of east japan railways 
apologized for the crash at a news conference after the accident 
yamanouchi said 28yearold teruki hirano who was driving the 
commuter train might have missed a signal before plowing into the 
back of a train stopped at the higashinakano station said a japan 
railways official 
hirano and yoji abo 31 a resident of tokyo were killed in the 
940 am collision police said they said two of the injured were 
in critical condition 
police said the exact cause of the collision was not known 
the impact crushed parts of two cars and derailed several cars 
about 10 fire department rescue teams worked to free people from the 
cars news reports said at least 600 people were on the two trains 
passengers said there was a huge crash and they were thrown to 
the floor 
the train was lifted up quite a bit and seats were broken and 
thrown all over in the train said an unidentified man in a 
television interview 
the railway official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
traffic signals on the rail line are controlled automatically to 
signal approaching trains to stop 
he said all east japan railways trains are connected to the 
system which also sounds a buzzer to warn drivers that a train is 
blocking the line ahead 
the buzzer however can be switched off by the driver and in 
metropolitan tokyo drivers usually turn off the system for smoother 
service during rush hours the official said 
it was possible that hirano either missed the red light or had 
his buzzer system off the official said 
news reports said westbound trains were running about 10 minutes 
behind schedule when the commuter train rammed into the rear of the 
other train 
keiko uehara who runs a bookstore near higashinakano station 
said the crash made such a noise that i thought a building had 
fallen down 
tokyo police are investigating the accident and questioning the 
driver of the second train as well as the conductors on both trains 
police said 
the accident was the first involving injuries on tokyo commuter 
trains since march 1986 when about 60 people were hurt in a 
twotrain collision 
the last train accident in japan involving fatalities was in 
december 1984 when a train driver was killed and at least 120 
people were injured in a headon collision between two trains

gettingtoknowyou stage 
we can speak open now said vladimir plise a cantor at a 
moscow synagogue 
on sunday the 170 soviet delegates and 169 american delegates to 
the usussr emerging leaders summit took advantage of the 
chance to play tennis racquetball golf billiards chess and 
volleyball at cigna corps corporate center eagle lodge in 
suburban montgomery county 
plise called the facility clever very organized although 
the soviet union has similar centers he called them rest 
houses they are not as big as eagle lodge he said 
lilia vlasova a soviet lawyer said through an interpreter that 
she enjoyed seeing american recreation 
in her hometown of minsk in the republic of byelorussia she said 
she is helping plan a youth center and eagle lodge has given her 
some ideas 
bruce shaeffer a spokesman for eagle lodge said that although 
cigna has no delegates at the conference the philadelphiabased 
insurer offered the use of the 280acre center in the spirit of 
cooperation 
on saturday the group got a different look at american sports by 
attending the armynavy football game in which army defeated navy 
2015 
on sunday morning the delegates had brunch with congressional 
representatives and other government officials 
delegates to the firstever gathering of rising stars from the 
two nations were chosen to be part of 16 commissions that are 
discussing topics such as creative arts international business 
mass media the military religion education science and medicine 
during breaks sunday some of the delegates discussed the 
progress of the sevenday conference 
vlasova said the domestic and international law commission will 
discuss education of attorneys and the use of computers in teaching 
law 
nikolai devyatkin a pastor at a church in northern russia said 
the religion commission is discussing problems that churches face in 
the two countries 
he said he visited a black church in philadelphia on sunday and 
was impressed by the emotion displayed 
i have never seen that before today he said 
plise the cantor said he too feels there are differences 
between churches in the countries but has not exactly figured them 
out 
we need time to understand this process he said 
while the soviet delegates were far from their homeland the 
ethnic strife and nationalism boiling in some of the soviet 
republics was on the minds of some of them 
rein kaarepere assistant to the prime minister of estonia was 
wearing the traditional blue black and white colors of the estonian 
flag and speaks estonian he is among those who hope the once 
sovereign country can establish an economy not beholden to moscow 
only for the past year have estonians been able to wear the 
colors of their state which was free between the first and second 
world wars the republics leaders have led the charge in a recent 
quest by soviet minorities for greater autonomy 
the soviet union under mikhail gorbachevs perestroika or 
restructuring is aiming for drastic change in its economic 
structure but its another thing when this is warped to an 
absurdity said viktor mironenko a member of the supreme soviets 
presidium the countrys highest executive body and also a delegate 
to the conference 
elsewhere in the soviet union nationalism has turned violent at 
least 60 people have died since february in ethnic rioting between 
armenians and azebaijanis in the soviet caucasus region near the 
middle east 
delegates from those republics canceled their trips to the 
conference as violence flared again in recent weeks

president chaim herzog today granted prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc a threeweek extension to form 
a government and urged it to try again to bring the rival labor 
party into a coalition 
shamir so far has failed to attract labor into a broadbased 
coalition led by his rightwing party he appears close to forming a 
narrow coalition with small religious and farright parties 
shamir requested the extension after a threeweek mandate herzog 
gave him nov 14 expired israeli law allows for a threeweek 
extension 
by virtue of the power invested in me by law i have acceded to 
his request and agreed to grant him an extension of 21 days to 
form a government herzog said after meeting shamir at his residence 
the country needs a broad government we need a stable 
government to deal with the challenges and dangers we face herzog 
added his remarks were broadcast live by israel radio 
likud and labor have been uneasy governing partners since 1984 
the president also urged the new government to reform israels 
electoral system which resulted in a stalemate in nov 1 elections 
there is nothing like this system in the entire democratic 
world herzog said alluding to the complicated task facing shamir 
as he tries to bring together at least eight of 15 parties in the 
120member parliament to form a majority 
coalition bargaining since the elections has been characterized 
by acrimony within both the likud and the leftleaning labor party 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a top labor official lashed out 
at party leader shimon peres today accusing him of conducting 
secret negotiations with religious parties 
rabin denounced peres confidant yossi beilin as the poodle of 
peres for carrying out the talks without the knowledge of other 
party leaders 
beilin a member of labors rebellious young guard noted that he 
and rabin had longstanding ideological differences he told israel 
army radio that rabin in his old age is an embarrassment to the 
younger rabin i would prefer to remember him the way he was when he 
was young 
on sunday likud gained the upper hand in attempts to form a 
coalition government by signing an agreement with the ultraorthodox 
torah flag party which holds two seats in the parliament shamir 
now has the backing of 60 legislators in the 120member body 
last week the agudat israel religious party suprisingly defected 
from likud to labor apparently after being contacted by beilin 
beilin made the move a day before the labors executive bureau was 
to decide whether to approve laborlikud negotiations on forming a 
broadbased government 
the bureau eventually rejected the talks 
peres told army radio subday he accepted likuds conditions for 
labor joining a coalition but that shamir would have to make the 
first move 
however peres added at this stage i think we are closer to 
the opposition than to any other place 
shamir favors a broadbased government because it would reduce 
the pressure on likud to meet demands by its likely coalition 
partners four religious and three extreme rightwing parties 
public opinion polls held after the nov 1 balloting in which 
likud won 40 knesset seats to labors 39 showed that the majority 
of israelis supported a broadbased government 
secular israelis and us jews are worried that orthodox parties 
may succeed in passing farreaching religious legislation in 
exchange for their participation in a narrow government 
the likud made such promises to agudat israel to lure it back 
from labor a letter signed by shamir and several likud ministers 
was presented sunday night to the council of torah sages the 
spiritual advisory body of agudat israel 
the letter said likud would support legislation that gives 
orthodox rabbis sole authority over conversions to judaism 
the law is opposed by us jews because it would deny automatic 
immigration to israel by jews not converted by orthodox rabbis the 
majority of us jews are reform and conservative and they see the 
proposed change as a threat to their legitimacy

the supreme court today refused to bar police 
from conducting roadside sobriety tests by setting up checkpoints at 
unannounced locations 
the court by a 72 vote let stand a ruling from california that 
such tests for drunken driving do not violate the rights of 
motorists 
justices william j brennan and byron r white voted to hear 
arguments in the case but it takes the votes of at least four 
justices to grant such review 
police in anaheim calif arrested a juvenile identified as 
richard t in the early morning hours of new years day 1985 he was 
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol 
richard t was stopped at a police roadblock set up as part of a 
holiday season crackdown on drunken driving 
police announced in advance that the checkpoints would be set up 
around the city but did not advertise their locations 
police said they smelled alcohol on richard ts breath when they 
stopped him and they said he told them he was coming from a party 
he then was taken to a second checkpoint where he failed a sobriety 
test and was arrested 
a state appeals court ordered the test evidence suppressed the 
appeals court said police may conduct such tests only if there is an 
emergency if there is reason to believe in advance that a motorist 
is intoxicated or if the tests are carried out at fixed locations 
where motorists know they may be tested 
the california supreme court last march overturned the appeals 
court decision and ruled that the police acted lawfully 
lawyers for richard t said the checkpoints in anaheim were 
similar to roving police patrols that stop motorists for sobriety 
tests without reasonable suspicion of drunken driving the us 
supreme court barred such stops by roving patrols in a 1979 ruling 
california officials said the police conduct in anaheim did not 
violate motorists privacy rights 
given the serious safety and social problems presented by drunk 
drivers and the minimal intrusion to privacy caused by momentary 
detention at a sobriety checkpoint use of these checkpoints is 
reasonable the california attorney generals office said 
the case is richard t vs california 88318

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
70000 award to a tennessee woman who said her rights had been 
violated in a dispute with public school officials over godless 
textbooks 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by vicki frost a 
christian fundamentalist briefly arrested for refusing to leave 
school grounds during an attempt to remove her daughter from a 
reading class 
mrs frost of rogersville was among seven tennessee familes who 
objected to textbooks approved by the hawkins county board of 
education 
the supreme court last february denied an earlier appeal by the 
families essentially ending a case some had called scopes ii a 
reference to the furor surrounding the 1925 prosecution of john 
scopes in tennessee for teaching evolution 
the justices let stand a ruling that requiring children to read 
books their parents objected to does not violate the families 
constitutional rights 
the case acted on today involved a separate civil rights suit by 
mrs frost stemming from the dispute 
mrs frost a mother of three was allowed for a time in 1983 to 
remove her daughter sarah from a reading class at church hill 
elementary school 
school officials permitted mrs frost to take sarah to the 
schools library or cafeteria for a reading lesson from books mrs 
frost approved 
she objected to the schools textbooks which she said taught 
secular humanism evolution and other beliefs she considered 
godless 
school officials changed their policy in november 1983 and no 
longer permitted mrs frost to remove sarah from the classroom for 
individual instruction 
mrs frost objected to the new policy and was jailed for about 
three hours on nov 23 1983 when she refused to leave the school 
premises after being ordered to by the school principal 
a jury awarded her 70000 in a federal lawsuit charging school 
officials with false imprisonment malicious prosecution violation 
of her freespeech rights and deprivation of the custody of her 
child 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals threw out the award last 
july 
the appeals court said her claims are without merit the 
appeals court said mrs frost was aware she no longer would be able 
to remove sarah from class and had an unencumbered freedom to 
put sarah in a private school a move she made in december 1983 
but rather than transfer sarah immediately frost chose to send 
her daughter back to church hill elementary and renew her disruption 
of the schools normal routine the appeals court said 
the evidence points so strongly in favor of school officials 
that we think reasonable minds could not come to a different 
conclusion the appeals court said 
the case is frost vs hawkins county board 88604

the supreme court today barred a new hampshire 
community from removing poles bearing sirens that could alert 
townspeople about an accident at the controversial seabrook nuclear 
power plant 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that limits the 
power of cities to revoke licenses for the poles 
public service of new hampshire major owner of seabrook is 
required by the nuclear regulatory commission to develop an 
emergency evacuation plan in case of an accident at the plant 
the utility company installed sirens placed on poles in several 
seacoast communities including rye nh 
the poles are about 60 feet high with sirens weighing about 500 
pounds attached to them 
the rye board of selectmen in 1984 licensed three poles in the 
town the new hampshire department of transportation also authorized 
poles on state highways including state roads that pass through rye 
the board of selectmen then changed its mind and sought to revoke 
the licenses a state judge ordered the poles removed but the new 
hampshire supreme court overruled the judge last march 
towns may not veto nuclear evacuation plans without good reason 
such as public safety the state supreme court said 
the state court said rye selectmen lack the authority to revoke 
the licenses they granted for any reason other than a reason 
relating to the safe free and convenient use for public travel of 
the highway the state court said the selectmen offered no 
justification based on safety for removing the poles 
the 56 billion seabrook plant has been a target of protests 
since before construction began in 1976 
it was completed in 1986 but has been unable to get a federal 
operating license federal regulators have yet to approve evacuation 
plans for communities surrounding seabrook including some in 
massachusetts 
there are also serious financial problems with public service of 
new hampshire having filed for bankruptcy protection in january 
the case is rye vs public service of new hampshire 88621

the supreme court today agreed to resolve 
conflicting decisions by federal appeals courts in a tax dispute 
between the internal revenue service and the life insurance industry 
the court said it will decide whether the ceding commissions 
a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another firms 
policies may be claimed as tax deductions for the year they are paid 
the irs refused to let colonial american life insurance co a 
lousianabased corporation claim some 15 million in such 
deductions for 1975 and 1976 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the tax agencys 
refusal last april but other appeals courts have allowed such 
deductions 
colonial americans appeal to the nations highest court was 
supported by the american council of life insurance and the national 
association of life companies 
the reagan administration arguing that the 5th circuit court 
ruled correctly nevertheless urged the justices to take the 
colonial american case to resolve the conflicting lower court 
rulings 
colonial american in 1975 and 1976 agreed to partially indemnify 
transport life insurance co policies in return colonial american 
became entitled to the same percentage of future premiums received 
on the policies 
the agreements provided that transport was to pay as reinsurance 
premiums amounts equal to the reserves required to cover colonial 
americans liability on the policies 
the reinsurance premiums were 675762 for 1975 and 851398 for 
1976 
the agreements also required colonial american to pay transport 
life ceding commissions in consideration for the business acquired 
the commissions totaled 680000 in 1975 and 852000 in 1976 
colonial american then sought to deduct as business losses the 
full amount of the commissions in the years they were paid 
the irs disallowed the deductions ruling that those amounts 
represented the acquisition costs of future benefits the tax agency 
said that the ceding commissions should be capitalized and amortized 
over the period of the policies indemnification seven years 
the us tax court ruled for colonial american but the 5th 
circuit court reversed that ruling 
the case is colonial american vs commissioner of internal 
revenue 88396

a fire near yellowstone national park 
that threatened cooke city mont last summer could have been 
snuffed out in its earliest stages government officials say in new 
reports 
but another blaze which almost burned the historic old faithful 
complex at the park and threatened west yellowstone mont was 
impossible to control the reports said 
in all the 10 major fires that cut a swath of flames through 
yellowstone burned about 706000 acres the latest report friday 
indicated the fires covered much less than the 1 millionacre 
estimate given in september 
the new figures based on satellite pictures assessed last week 
indicate that about 32 percent of the 22 millionacre park burned 
by underestimating drought conditions yellowstone firefighters 
missed an early opportunity to stop the clovermist fire in the 
northeast corner of the park which threatened cooke city an 
interagency review team said instead of their own observations 
park and national forest officials relied on fire information 
gathered since the early 1970s the report said 
the clover and mist fires eventually merged and burned 309600 
acres in the park and national forests 
another team that looked at the north fork fire on the parks 
western edge which threatened the old faithful area concluded that 
no amount of resources would have stopped it 
the reports were prepared by national park service and us 
forest service fire specialists who interviewed managers and fire 
bosses 
the clover and mist fires started july 9 and july 11 
at this time the park could have suppressed both fires with 
initial action forces the report said projected spread and 
worstcase analysis underestimated the potential of these fires to 
cross the continental divide onto the shoshone national forest 
dan sholly yellowstones chief ranger said historic weather 
trends showing rains in july and august led park officials to 
underestimate fire conditions but he noted that even the countrys 
best fire experts underestimated fire conditions later in the summer 
were mortals he said 
dick hodge forest ranger on the clearwater national forest in 
potlatch and a member of the review team said that the first five 
days july 914 were the only chance park officials had to stop the 
blazes 
after that it had grown big enough that we doubted they could 
have controlled it completely hodge said in a phone interview 
the north fork fire started july 22 when a wood cutter dropped a 
cigarette in the targhee national forest it quickly spread and 
bulldozers were not allowed inside the park during the initial 
attack 
but with spot fires detected up to a half mile ahead of the fire 
the next day troy kurth the yellowstone area fire commander 
judged that bulldozer lines would not hold the fire 
there could have been a loss of equipment crews in danger and 
unnecessary damage to the environment the report said the end 
result an escaped fire would have been the same 
the review team went even further in supporting the firefighting 
effort by park and fire bosses 
using more resources in most instances would not have led to 
greater control of the main fire they said in the report 
the north fork and wolf lake fires eventually covered more than 
500000 acres in yellowstone and targhee national forest 
the review teams submitted their reports friday to the greater 
yellowstone coordinating committee in denver the committee will 
present reports to the larger interagency group that is preparing a 
final report on the fires for congress and the secretaries of the 
interior and agriculture it is due for release dec 15

investigators are trying to determine 
whether israeli counterterrorism expert amiram nir was really 
interested in avocados during a visit to this backwater town that 
ended with his death in a plane crash 
nir who died wednesday was not known as an avocado exporter he 
had advised two israeli prime ministers on terrorism and was linked 
to the irancontra deal that embarrassed the reagan administration 
avocado grower carlos garcia mendez and a police official said 
nir stayed in the best hotel discussed avocado prices and inspected 
an avocado processing plant during a threeday visit to this town 
nearly 200 miles west of mexico city 
it was his destiny to die here was the only explanation 
mendez could offer sunday in an interview 
staffers at the hotel real de uruapan said nir was traveling with 
a man who registered as a lebanese and left before nir did 
the wife of the owner of aerotaxis of uruapan marta amezcua 
said nir and adriana stanton a canadian woman who was working for 
an avocado operation chartered a small plane on wednesday 
the aerotaxis plane crashed near ciudad hidalgo killing nir and 
an airline employee and injuring ms stanton and the pilot 
amezcuas son 
a security guard stands outside the room where ms stanton is 
hospitalized in mexico city ms stanton who suffered leg arm and 
facial fractures has refused to speak to reporters since thursday 
when she said she barely knew nir 
no one can explain why nir who registered under his own name at 
the hotel apparently gave an assumed name when he chartered the 
aircraft 
israeli officials and friends of nirs in israel said he was in 
mexico on business but they refused to say what the business 
involved 
garcia mendez is a partner in eupasa a sixmonth old business 
that is trying to export avocados to europe through nucal a swiss 
firm he said his operation grows about 500 tons of avocados a year 
mexico has been looking for expanded export markets for 
agricultural products such as avocados 
garcia mendez said nir dealt mostly with pedro curchet an 
official of eupasa in charge of quality control he said ms stanton 
was in charge of shipping arrangements for eupasa 
curchet was the man who went to ciudad hidalgo and identified 
nirs body according to federal judicial police commander jose luis 
arriaga curchet said nir had planned to return to uruapan in a 
week possibly to close a deal with eupasa according to arriaga 
arriaga said he had no evidence nirs visit involved anything but 
avocados 
hotel personnel said curchet and stanton had been in uruapan 
since september which is when the avocado harvest begins 
eupasa employs about 50 people in its packing operation and 
other avocado growers in the area recently formed a competing 
organization the association of producers and exporters 
on sunday the washington post quoted nir as saying in an 
interview earlier this year that counterterrorist operations he 
supervised in 1985 and 1986 with former white house aide oliver 
north were authorized by a secret agreement between the united 
states and israel 
israel denied the report secretary of state george shultz asked 
if such an agreement ever existed said not that i know of

the supreme court today asked the justice 
department for its views on whether states may prosecute nonindians 
accused of crimes against indians on tribal reservations 
the court invited government lawyers to comment on an appeal by 
arizona officials seeking to prosecute a nonindian school teacher 
accused of sexual relations with indian boys on a navajo reservation 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will grant full 
review to the case until hearing from the government that could 
take months 
a lower court ruled that the federal government has exclusive 
authority to prosecute the man 
the teacher conrad marion flint was indicted twice by state 
grand juries on charges of oral sexual contact with minors and 
commercial sexual exploitation of minors 
flint who is not an indian taught fifth grade students at the 
kayenta school district on the navajo reservation 
he allegedly lured indian boys to his apartment leased from the 
navajos paid them to pose nude and engaged in sexual acts with them 
the state said it seized more than 2000 photographs and 
videotapes from flints apartment 
a state judge threw out the indictments on grounds only the 
federal government may prosecute nonindians for crimes against 
indians that take place on tribal reservations 
the arizona court of appeals upheld the judges ruling last 
january 
the appeals court citing a 1946 supreme court ruling said flint 
is charged with serious sexual crimes against several young indian 
males thus creating a strong tribal interest in such cases 
state officials lack authority to act the state court said 
the case is arizona vs flint 88603

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit seeking money for six injured fbi agents and for the 
families of two agents killed in a miami gun battle with two men who 
also died 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the agents 
and their families should be allowed to use a federal 
antiracketeering law to recover damages from the estates of the two 
alleged criminals 
the shootout occurred on april 11 1986 as the result of an fbi 
investigation into a series of robberies extortions and attempted 
murders in the miami area 
after a car chase the agents caught up with michael lee platt 
and william russell matix after the two men allegedly robbed the 
barnett bank in miami 
in the ensuing gun battle agents benjamin grogan and jerry dove 
were killed along with platt and matix the injured agents were john 
hanlon gordon mcneill edmundo mireles richard manauzzi gilbert 
orrantia and ronald risner 
the agents and their families sought compensation under the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
the federal law is used for criminal prosecutions and also 
authorizes civil lawsuits for recovery of triple damages for any 
person injured in his business or property by racketeering 
activities 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals last january upheld a 
federal judges ruling throwing out the suit 
in our view the ordinary meaning of the phrase injured in his 
business or property excludes personal injuries including the 
pecuniary losses therefrom the appeals court said we do not 
understand congress to have authorized recovery for these injuries 
the 11th circuit court noted that the supreme court in 1985 
permitted wide latitude for civil suits invoking rico and that the 
law was being used in increasingly imaginative ways 
but the appeals court said some limits on civil rico still 
exist 
the case is grogan vs platt 88650

president daniel ortega of nicaragua said 
today he would not go to the united nations this week because the 
united states failed to issue enough visas for his party and imposed 
unacceptable restrictions on his stay 
i cannot accept these rules because the united states cannot 
decide when how and with whom a chief of state can visit an 
international organization like the united nations ortega told a 
news conference 
he complained that the united states should not require 15 days 
notice to approve the trip of a chief of state and his party to the 
united nations 
ortega said the reagan administration refused to issue visas for 
half his party and also refused to issue visas for nicaraguan 
journalists who wished to accompany him 
he also said the united states limited his travels to four 
boroughs of new york city ortega said this would prevent him from 
visiting the home of the nicaraguan ambassador to the united 
nations who lives outside that area 
the united states has violated international norms and its 
promises to the united nations and has broken the principles of the 
united nations ortega said 
he said that at the united nations he had hoped to describe the 
extensive damage done in nicaragua by hurricane joan and plead for 
international help 
ortega said he also wanted to confer with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar about a new proposal for the united nations 
to participate in verifiying a central american peace accord 
ortega was in mexico for the inauguration of president carlos 
salinas de gortari he said he was returning today to managua the 
nicaraguan capital 
on friday us officials said visas had been approved for 
ortega his wife rosario and his son rafael on dec 5 they were 
to be accompanied by ortegas physician and 14 guards 
visa applications from 14 other nicaraguans who wished to 
accompany ortega as part of his official party were turned down 
because they were submitted too late to allow adequate time for 
processing us officials said 
us officials said ortega had planned to meet with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who will address the un general 
assembly this week and will meet with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush

parents and children say a school 
districts ban on a nonbiblical play based on the birth of jesus 
violates their first amendemnt rights but administrators say they 
are upholding the constitution 
a fifthgrade class in central michigan selected no room at the 
inn from a book of plays in the school library the play tells the 
story of a coldhearted innkeeper who refuses a room to a pregnant 
woman then is transformed after the baby is born 
superintendent john reynolds of the waverly school district said 
the play could be viewed as promotion of christianity 
school officials are just trying to be sensitive to their 
duties to abide by the law schools attorney scott szpara said 
the content appears to violate the first amendments 
establishment clause which forbids public schools from favoring or 
encouraging any religion 
but parents say they are not buying the argument they met 
saturday to press their demand for a special board of education 
meeting tuesday on the ban 
the ban violates the childrens constitutional right to free 
speech and another first amendment clause that prevents the state 
from inhibiting the free exercise of religion said david kallman 
an attorney representing the parents 
several students expressed the same view 
its just not fair said peggy huizen 10 a fifthgrader 
i can understand they dont like religious plays performed but we 
found this in our own school library in a book of traditional 
holiday plays 100 plays for children its not a religious play 
kallman said the play doesnt promote a specific religion because 
it is a fictional account 
jesus name isnt even in it kallman said

a simple domelike structure used by plains 
indians for ancient worship rites is the focus of a longrunning 
battle over religion and rehabilitation between tribal leaders and 
utah state prison officials 
six indian inmates are suing for the right to build sweat lodges 
at the states only maximum security prison 25 miles south of salt 
lake city 
its a form of worship and i think prison officials really 
ought to be more cognizant of it as a rehabilitative tool said 
travis parashonts a paiute indian who is director of the utah 
office of indian affairs its a very uplifting and spiritual 
experience 
but prison officials say the lodges represent a security risk 
and call the indians demand unreasonable 
permitting a sweat lodge would be akin to allowing a mosque and 
minaret for the moslems a shrine for the buddhists a temple for 
the latterday saints and a cathedral for the catholics said 
corrections executive director gary deland a defendant in the 
20monthold federal lawsuit that is scheduled for trial next month 
the sweat lodge is a small structure made of willow poles covered 
with blankets or dirt they are often circular resembling tepees but 
can be square hutlike structures 
inside usually about eight to 10 people sing and pray around a 
pit of heated stones in a quest for purification forgiveness and 
spiritual renewal some indians pray to a great spirit who is the 
father of all things and a life force others pray to spirits 
associated with various aspects of nature like rocks or animals 
tribal leaders have been frustrated by the prison ban on lodges 
particularly because nine other western states allow them in their 
prisons the other states include arizona and nevada which like 
utah is where the 25000squaremile navajo reservation is located 
the 180000member navajo tribe has repeatedly offered to 
construct a sweat lodge at its own cost estimated at only about 
50 and provide medicine men to conduct ceremonies 
it wouldnt cost the state anything said larry foster the 
tribes director of intergovernmental relations given the fact 
that weve been able to work with all the other states i guess in a 
sense its perplexing 
tribal officials say comparisons with structures for other 
religions are unfair because sweat lodges can be built so quickly 
and cheaply they also dismiss fears of security risks 
there is nothing there at a sweat lodge ceremony that could 
be used in a negative manner said clifford duncan director of 
the ute indian museum at fort duchesne there are about 2200 utes 
living on the 2 millionacre uintah and ouray reservation in eastern 
utah 
the lawsuit was filed in march 1987 and is scheduled for trial 
jan 9 in us district court 
plaintiffs attorney danny quintana said he hoped newly elected 
attorney general paul van dam a democrat would be more flexible 
than his predecessor republican david wilkinson and seek to settle 
the issue out of court 
he seems to have a little more common sense than his 
predecessor but i dont know i hope so quintana said 
van dam said he plans to review the case but he would not discuss 
the likelihood of a settlement its simply a matter that will 
take me a few weeks to get to but that is an important case 
he said 
foster said the navajo will watch van dams arrival with interest 
but will continue irregardless to assist those inmates in the 
practice of their religion

gov michael s dukakis today urged leaders of the 
nations cities to keep the municipal issues that were raised during 
the 1988 presidential campaign before the incoming bush 
administration 
homelessness and potential cuts in medicare and medicaid funding 
were among the issues dukakis cited in a speech to 5000 delegates 
to the 65th congress of the national league of cities which 
formally opened today 
the issues we raised in the campaign havent dissappeared 
because the election is over the former democratic presidential 
candidate said we can not retreat we can not go backwards 
dukakis blamed a lack of affordable housing on cuts in federal 
housing subsidies during the reagan administration but indicated he 
and presidentelect george bush found some common ground on the 
issue during their meeting last friday 
he called it a national disgrace and it is dukakis said 
dukakis said forging partnerships among state and local 
governments the banking industry and building trade unions is 
necessary to ease the housing crunch 
more than 8000 delegates from 1300 local governments were 
expected to attend the convention the leagus is the nations 
largest municipal organization 
earlier league officials said they will urge the bush 
administration to strengthen ties between local and federal 
government 
in the past there has not been a positive relationship between 
the state and federal levels the leagues vice president mayor 
terry goddard of phoenix said saturday 
boston mayor raymond l flynn called the convention an 
excellent opportunity to set an urban agenda for the nations 
cities 
league president pamela p plumb a portland maine city council 
member and former mayor said the nations cities and towns will 
bear the brunt of deficit reduction programs unless presidentelect 
bush deals with revenue collection in a serious way 
she said critical issues cited by delegates for discussion at the 
convention include affordable housing economic development job 
training fighting innercity drug use and improving education 
cleveland mayor george voinovich said that during the past two 
years the federal government has cut state programs by 60 percent 
a message needs to be sent to washington saying no more 
mandates regulations or intrusion in state and local fiscal 
affairs he said

the supreme court today set the stage for an 
important ruling on the constitutionality of enormous 
punitivedamage awards that have become increasingly common in a 
range of lawsuits 
the justices agreed to study the issue in an appeal by 
browningferris industries inc a waste collection business with 
headquarters in houston the company was ordered to pay 6 million 
to a burlington vt competitor that accused the texas company of 
undercutting its prices in an effort to drive it out of business 
the high court last may declined to decide the constitutionality 
of such enormous punitivedamage awards in personalinjury and 
breachofcontract cases 
in its may ruling the court cited narrow procedural reasons for 
upholding a 18 million judgment won by an injured mississippi man 
against an insurance company that wrongfully rejected his 20000 
claim 
left unresolved was the legitimacy of skyrocketing 
punitivedamage awards a development that has touched off a wave of 
legislative activity often called tort reform 
some states reacting to soaring insurance rates have imposed 
ceilings on how much punitivedamage money can be recovered 
the courts decision last may and its dismissal shortly 
thereafter of several cases that mounted similar challenges to 
punitive damages indicated the justices were willing to give state 
legislatures and state courts more time to study the issue 
but the justices announced today they now will tackle the issue 
with a decision expected by july 
the court will review a decision by the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals last april that upheld the damage award against 
browningferris 
the company with revenues in excess of 13 billion in 1986 
decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal business in burlington 
vt 
the company appointed joseph kelley to be district manager for 
its new regional office 
kelley left browningferris in 1980 to form his own company 
kelco disposal inc which soon became a direct competitor 
kelco captured more than 40 percent of the market in the 
burlington region by 1982 
there was testimony in the case that browningferris then 
instructed its new burlington manager to put kelly out of 
business do whatever it takes squish him like a bug 
browningferris then cut its prices almost in half the 
pricecutting maneuver prompted a suit by kelly accusing 
browningferris of attempting to monopolize the waste collection 
market in the region in violation of antitrust laws 
a jury awarded kelco about 100000 in compensatory damages and

a former television preacher says he told a grand 
jury he had sex with jim bakker three times and arranged the fateful 
tryst with church secretary jessica hahn at bakkers urging 
according to a magazine interview 
john wesley fletcher who appeared on the ptl club television 
program from the mid1970s to 1981 described bakker as a bisexual 
who openly lusted after the shows young male camera operators 
i was jim bakkers male prostitute he said in the interview 
for januarys penthouse magazine 
fletcher is the second man to say publicly that he had sex with 
bakker in september former ptl official jay babcock said he had 
told the grand jury of a sexual encounter with bakker 
fletcher said in the interview released sunday that he related 
the sexual encounters to the federal grand jury investigating 
charges that bakker bakkers wife tammy and ptl aide david 
taggart illegally spent contributions to the ministry on their 
lavish lifestyles 
the grand jury meeting in charlotte nc apparently began 
deliberations today after a 16month investigation 
among other things witnesses have said the jury also is 
investigating whether ministry funds were used to pay 364000 in 
hush money to ms hahn or to entice aides to grant bakker homosexual 
favors the jury has been examining allegations of wire tax and 
mail fraud 
federal prosecutors were in the panels meeting room for nearly 
two hours this morning before returning to their offices and leaving 
the grand jury alone 
bakker the ptl founder has denied in a sworn deposition that he 
ever had a homosexual relationship with anyone and has denied 
charges of financial wrongdoing 
two attorneys for bakker jim toms and ryan hovis issued this 
statement sunday in response to the penthouse report 
sadly some socalled journalists continue to exploit human 
tragedy by stories such as the one we now understand to be in 
penthouse about mr fletcher 
he has lost his ministry and finances and recently has been 
hospitalized we would not want to further add to his difficulties 
by commenting on the story and simply point to where it is being 
published 
toms has said he believes it is only a matter of time before the 
grand jury indicts bakker 
fletcher said he participated in homosexual activity with bakker 
only reluctantly 
fletcher said he related allegations about bakkers sexual 
encounters to officials of the assemblies of god before the 
pentecostal denomination defrocked bakker in may 1987 
fletcher was removed from the assemblies of god ministry in 1981 
amid accusations of homosexual activity the magazine said 
penthouse reported that fletchers psychiatrist confirmed he 
spent a month in a hospital last spring recovering from a suicide 
attempt 
fletcher blamed himself in the interview for setting off ptls 
sexandhush money scandal by introducing hahn to bakker even 
though he said he did so at bakkers request hahn has charged that 
bakker and fletcher raped her in a florida hotel room fletcher said 
in the interview that she willingly had sex 
fletcher also charged that bakker often threatened suicide to 
manipulate those around him and was cynical about fundraising 
some of the little old ladies he called grandma grunts like 
here comes another pocketbook fletcher said

south africas foremost 
novelist nadine gordimer today testified in support of 11 black 
activists at the start of a hearing to determine their sentences for 
treason and terrorism 
four of the defendants including three leaders of the countrys 
largest antiapartheid group were convicted of treason and seven of 
terrorism last month after a trial that lasted more than three years 
two visiting us democratic senators sam nunn of georgia and 
david boren of oklahoma were among those crowding in a pretoria 
courtroom for todays hearing 
ms gordimer one of several leading foes of apartheid called to 
give mitigatory evidence said she supported the goals of the anc 
and felt that its guerrilla campaign was justified 
she said her fellow whites were to blame for stifling blacks 
nonviolent protests 
the time had to come that there had to be some military wing 
of the anc said ms gordimer a writer whose novels include 
julys people and burgers daughter 
the maximum penalty for treason and terrorism is death but most 
observers expect pretoria supreme court justice kees van dijkhorst 
to impose prison sentences on the 11 black activists when the 
hearing ends possibly this week 
in his verdict van dijkhorst ruled that the united democratic 
front a multiracial coalition formed in 1983 to seek black 
political rights was a revolutionary organization he said the 
front which was banned in february conspired with the outlawed 
african national congress to incite violence in 1984 aimed at making 
south africa ungovernable 
also testifying in support of the defendants were professor jakes 
gerwel chief administrator of the predominantly mixedrace 
university of the western cape and enos mabuza president of the 
homeland of kangwane 
the three bestknown defendants all convicted of treason are 
popo molefe 36 who was the united democratic fronts national 
secretary terror lekota 40 its publicity secretary and moses 
chikane 40 secretary of its transvaal province branch 
murphy morobe who succeeded lekota as the fronts chief 
spokesman reportedly discussed the treason trial sunday with the 
us senators who are on a factfinding trip 
according to the independent south african press association 
morobe told nunn and boren that the government was repressing young 
antiapartheid leaders while it was moving to release longserving 
political prisoners possibly including anc leader nelson mandela 
we do not see the moves to release older activists as an act of 
benevolence on the part of the government but rather one which 
takes the attention of the world away from what is being done to the 
younger people who are expected to take over the reins morobe was 
quoted as saying 
morobe and two colleagues spent five weeks holed up in the us 
consulate in johannesburg after escaping from detention on sept 13 
in another trial today a white conscientious objecter charles 
bester was convicted of refusing to serve in the armed forces and 
sentenced to six years in prison bester 18 told a johannesburg 
magistrate his christian beliefs would not allow him to serve in a 
force which he felt was used to maintain apartheid 
under apartheid blacks have no vote in ntional affairs the 
white minority controls the government and has separate districts 
schools and health services

an independent safety committee will meet 
next week to discuss the prerequisites for restarting one of the 
three closed savannah river plant nuclear reactors and one member 
says it will be difficult to meet a target of spring or summer for 
the restart 
a department of energy report on the restart calls for an 
unprecedented toptobottom inspection of the reactor as well as 
comprehensive changes in written procedures training and staffing 
throughout the governmentowned nuclear weapons fuel plant at aiken 
the reactors have been closed for safety reasons 
officials from the energy department and the department of 
defense are anxious for savannah river to resume operation because 
it is the nations only producer of tritium a radioactive gas that 
is critical for nuclear warheads 
pentagon experts have said that if savannah river does not have 
all three reactors operating by next summer extraordinary steps 
might be needed including deactivating warheads and transferring 
their tritium to higherpriority weapons 
on tuesday energy secretary john s herrington said one of the 
reactors at the troubled plant would open by spring or summer 
elmer schwartz a member of an independent safety committee 
established this year by herrington said it is possible to follow 
the reports guidelines and meet the deadline but it will take a 
hell of an effort 
but some energy department officials and independent safety 
experts believe it will take far longer possibly extending into 
early 1990 the new york times and the state newspapers reported 
robert m keller a senior nuclear engineer at the energy 
department who wrote the restart plan told the times it may take 
until december 1989 to start up the first of the reactors the 
newspaper said engineers estimated that it would take until the end 
of 1990 to restart the others 
the full safety committee is scheduled to review the startup 
criteria dec 13 and 14 in washington the plan reviewed by the 
committee will be final and contain a specific target date for the 
restart 
savannah rivers three operable reactors were limited to 50 
percent power in march 1987 because of concerns about the ability of 
their emergency cooling systems to prevent melting of the 
radioactive core during an accident 
once the reactors are returned to service power levels may be 
further reduced because of safety questions the state reported 
no matter how long the overhaul of the first reactor takes 
schwartz and others believe the new procedures will enhance overall 
safety at savannah river and at 16 other energy department weapons 
production facilities over the past eight months each has come 
under increasing public and congressional scrutiny spawned by 
decades of lax safety practices 
energy department officials have proposed replacing the three 
aging savannah river reactors with a 4 billion heavywater reactor 
rep lindsay thomas dga whose congressional district lies 
across the state line from the savannah river plant said he would 
oppose funding for the new reactor because of the facilitys poor 
safety record thomas a member of the house appropriations 
committee was to testify today at an energy department 
environmental hearing in savannah on the proposed reactor

new hampshire gov john sununu says george 
bush will maintain his interest in western and environmental issues 
after he becomes president because he has had a lifelong love 
affair with the outdoors 
i think you are going to see a lot of attention paid by george 
bush to outdoor issues sununu the presidentelects choice for 
chief of staff said over the weekend during a break from skiing 
sununu who will assume his new post when bush takes office in 
january spent several days skiing at the vail and beaver creek 
resorts in the rocky mountains and visiting with friends though new 
hampshire has its share of ski areas most are not yet open for the 
season 
he said the bush administration hopes to strike a balance between 
the concerns of environmentalists and the nations need to use 
natural resources 
its a shame in this country that during the political season 
some of the constituency groups have a natural affinity for one 
party or the other he said it is difficult for republicans to 
wean environmental groups away from the democrats 
a recent meeting between bush and environmentalists was just the 
beginning of a dialogue between the two he said 
since the election theyve had a chance to look at the reality 
of bushs background and what he wants to accomplish sununu said 
sununu said he plans to make a special effort to see that bush 
gets input from regular citizens as well as washington insiders

the colorado state health department permit for destruction of 
the missile motors requires a minimum 4 mph wind from the west to 
disperse fumes from the burning rocket fuel and drive it away from 
the city of pueblo located several miles to the west 
we are waiting on the wind and are in a holding pattern once 
the wind picks up well go ahead said sgt brian lodermeier at 
the pueblo army depot 
the first burn of two missile motors had been scheduled for 10

isolation of his village he was unaware of great events he did not 
know that world war i and world war ii had happened and had no 
concept of a bomb 
but he had heard of bombay the metropolis 220 miles south

us forces were a 
key to halting the persian gulf war and taught iran terrorism on 
the high seas does not pay political dividends defense secretary 
frank c carlucci said monday 
he delivered the message at an awards ceremony aboard the la 
salle flagship of the us navy task force and repeated it during 
a brief news conference on the third day of a fourday gulf tour 
in answer to a question carlucci defended the us denial of a 
visa for palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat to 
address the un general assembly in new york the assembly session 
will move to geneva as a result 
arab gulf states joined a not surprisingly negative reaction 
to the decision by us secretary of state george shultz he said 
but added that none had raised the issue during his trip shultz 
refused the visa on grounds arafat condones terrorism 
carlucci came here from oman was to visit saudi arabia and kuwait 
before returning to washington on wednesday 
he delivered a personal message from president reagan to sheik 
isa bin salman al khalifa emir of bahrain and confered with sheik 
khalifa bin ahmed al khalifa the defense minister who met him at 
the airport 
they discussed bilateral relations and issues of common 
interest the official gulf news agency reported 
us sources said privately the bahrainis registered displeasure 
about the arafat visa controversy by what one called a 
downgrading of protocol so subtle that only the us 
government is likely to notice it 
the source said the message was conveyed mainly by the fact that 
carlucci was met by the defense minister rather than the crown 
prince sheik hamad bin isa bin salman al khalifa who had greeted 
him in january 
carlucci said events that culminated in the aug 20 truce in the 
8yearold war between iran and iraq vindicated the us decision to 
have a strong naval presence in the gulf 
results speak for themselves he told officers and crew 
assembled on the la salles flight deck 
through your actions in large measure you have helped bring 
an end to one of the bloodiest wars in history he said 
we have succeeded in convincing iran that terrorism on the high 
seas does not pay political dividends we have demonstrated that we 
can stand by our friends and we have demonstrated that we know who 
our friends are 
he said the largest us naval operation since vietnam also 
demonstrated to the world our ablity to project power to show 
determination and to defend vital principles including the principle 
of freedom of navigation 
at the news conference carlucci said those actions in turn 
contributed to a substantial degree to the ceasefire and to 
maintaining the flow of oil through the strait of hormuz 
gateway to the persian gulf 
all four gulf states on carluccis itinerary have provided some 
support to the us effort to keep commercial shipping lanes open 
and discourage iranian threats and attacks 
some european navies are pulling out of the gulf but carlucci 
indicated the united states was in no rush to reduce its forces 
which have been trimmed by two ships to 25 since the truce 
he said the pentagon was not talking about any specific 
drawdown and had set no numerical targets 
what we want to do is remain alert and ready until were 
confident that the ceasefire will take hold he said and with 
unsponsored peace talks going very slowly we think it is 
prudent for us to maintain a fairly good presence in the gulf until 
there are some further developments 
carlucci presented achievement awards to four sailors seaman

pugh of corvallis ore quartermaster 2 terry d yarbrough of

the crew of space shuttle atlantis 
successfully deployed a powerful radar satellite over the weekend 
reportedly the chief goal of the clandestine military mission 
knowledgeable sources said today 
the 500 million lacrosse satellite reportedly was designed to 
gather extremely sharp allweather images of eastern bloc military 
targets and would help american intelligence agencies monitor soviet 
compliance with arms control treaties 
the sources who requested anonymity said the satellite was 
operating well as it followed a course that carries it over 80 
percent of the soviet union 
they also reported that atlantis was expected to return to earth 
tuesday afternoon landing at edwards air force base in california 
the national aeronautics and space administration has said it would 
provide 24 hours advance notice of a landing time 
as word about the satellite was reported atlantis five 
astronauts were beginning the fourth day of their mission and nasa 
and the air force were keeping a tight lid on information about 
their activities 
before today there had been no inflight information leaked to 
news agencies as it was on two earlier defense department shuttle 
missions 
it seems the air force and nasa have learned how to plug the 
leaks said one official sunday on condition he not be named 
sources had said before fridays launch from cape canaveral that 
the flight would end today or tuesday unless the crew needed more 
time to deploy the radar satellite or to conduct other 
militaryoriented experiments 
at edwards a ground crew sunday conducted a simulated shuttle 
landing an exercise normally done a day or two before a mission 
ends but there was no announcement of a landing 
plans for the next shuttle flight set for feb 18 received a 
setback last week when part of a rocket for boosting a 
communications satellite into orbit from the shuttle was badly 
damaged 
a worker bumped into the nozzle on the rockets first stage and 
cracked it during during prelaunch checks thursday and the entire 
first stage will be replaced said nasa spokesman george diller 
testing was to have begun dec 10 on the combined first and 
second stages of the twostage booster he said the tests will be 
delayed until about dec 27 he said and technicians probably would 
have to work two shifts a day seven days a week to maintain the 
launch schedule for the discoverys mission he said 
the satellite deployed by the atlantis crew reportedly is to 
serve someday as the radar eye for the new b2 stealth bomber 
selecting potential targets that would eliminate the need for the 
aircraft to use its own radar which might disclose its location 
the astronauts also reportedly were to conduct several 
experiments aimed at defining mans role as an observer in space 
with emphasis on reconnaissance it was believed they were to test a 
new optical device that resembles binoculars 
navy cmdr robert l gibson commands the flight the other crew 
members are col richard m mullane lt col guy s gardner and lt 
col jerry l ross of the air force and navy cmdr william m 
shepherd 
the mission is the 27th in the shuttle program the third 
dedicated solely to the military and the second since the 1986 
challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and halted flights 
for 32 months

the president gave prime minister yitzhak shamir 
another three weeks to form a government urging him monday to forge 
a coalition with labor and reform a complex system that has produced 
two stalemated elections 
president chaim herzog said israels political parties are 
bargaining for position while political and economic problems 
approach crisis proportions 
his appeal for national unity came after three weeks of political 
jockeying by shamirs rightist likud bloc the rival centerleft 
labor party of foreign minister shimon peres and small 
ultraorthodox religious parties 
shamir and peres have been equal partners in a national unity 
since inconclusive 1984 elections and traded jobs two years ago in 
the nov 1 elections likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats and 
labor got 39 
speaking at the ceremony at his residence in which he gave shamir 
the extension herzog said the new government should change israels 
electoral system which resulted in parliament seats for 15 parties 
nov 1 but left no party with a majority 
there is no parallel in the democratic world for our odd and 
incomprehensible system herzog said with shamir at his side 
i believe that i speak for the great majority of israels 
people when i express a sense of frustration helplessness 
humiliation and shame as well as grave concern 
of antireligious sentiment resulting from demands by 
ultraorthodox parties for special laws and regulations in exchange 
for joining a coalition herzog said confused and dangerous 
emotions are being aroused there are attitudes that recall the 
dark days of antijewish persecution 
he recommended another likudlabor coalition although shamir has 
been edging in recent days toward a narrow government with small 
rightwing and orthodox factions religious parties won a total of 
18 seats in the knesset israels parliament 
herzog said i shall repeat what i said three weeks ago the 
state of israel needs a broad government it must have a stable 
government if it is to stand up to the perils and challenges which 
face it 
peres agreed with the president about reform after each 
election the major parties instead of arguing between them 
about the central issues compete for the support of the religious 
parties he said this is absurd we must change the system 
shamir would not speak with reporters after meeting with herzog 
he has lined up 65 of the 120 knesset seats with the support of 
small parties but his 21day mandate ran out monday and he requested 
an extension as allowed by law 
religious parties have demanded a law that would recognize only 
conversions to judaism made by orthodox rabbis which the 
conservative and reform movements oppose they also want important 
cabinet posts and strict enforcement of the jewish sabbath 
agudat israel a relgious party with five knesset seats kept the 
entire country waiting sunday night while its spiritual mentors the 
torah sages decided whether to honor an agreement signed with labor 
last week they broke it opening the way for a likud government 
the popular tabloid yediot ahronot published a list monday of 17 
promises it said likud made to agudat israel including three 
ministries the powerful position of parliament finance committee 
chairman and pledges to ban abortion and advertisements featuring 
scantily clad women 
editorial cartoonists have skewered the religious parties almost 
daily 
a cartoon in the yediot ahronot showed a tank topped by the black 
hat traditionally worn by the ultraorthodox its cannon pointed at 
peres and shamir the caption said your money and your soul

president roh taewoo called for law 
and order monday after naming a new cabinet indicating his 
government will crack down on violent protesters 
democracy means order not confusion it is the peoples wish 
that the governments just public power must be established roh 
told his new cabinet 
in the most extensive reorganization since he took office in 
february roh named a new premier and replaced 19 cabinet ministers 
monday 
but opponents said he failed to purge the government of the 
dictatorial legacy of his disgraced predecessor chun doohwan 
it seemed unlikely the muchheralded changes would have a major 
impact on public opinion or help still widespread demands for chuns 
punishment 
roh said the new cabinets first priority is to maintain law and 
order by taking a resolute stand on leftist and terrorist groups 
official shorthand for violent antigovernment forces 
he named retired general and former ambassador to britain kang 
younghoon as prime minister and replaced all but three of his 
ministers in an effort to appease raging public anger over chun and 
show his commitment to democratic reforms 
kang said his main concern is to wipe out excessive 
authoritarianism that marked the chun government 
the shuffle affected several cabinetlevel posts including the 
promotion of seoul olympic organizer park sehjik to head the main 
intelligence organization the agency for national security planning 
government officials requesting anonymity said roh is expected 
to revamp the leadership of his democratic justice party in the next 
few days and remove some chun confidants 
presidential spokesman lee soojung said the changes would 
ensure further democratic reforms and put the mind of the public 
at rest following the anxiety created by problems of the past era 
but opposition parties showed disappointment in appointments of 
what they called hardline rightists from the governing party 
they said roh has not fulfilled promises to cut ties with chuns 
authoritarian government 
we are surprised that the new cabinet includes persons who 
actively supported dictatorship said lee sangsoo spokesman for 
kim daejungs main opposition party for peace and democracy 
the democratic reunification party said we are skeptical about 
the governments intention to liquidate the chun government 
opposition leaders are especially critical of keeping in the 
cabinet administration minister kim yonggap whom they consider 
ultrarightist most dismissed ministers were littleknown 
dissident groups that have organized violent protests demanding 
chuns arrest and rohs overthrow dismissed the cabinet changes as 
a deception to continue militarybacked rule 
among major appointments 
cho sung a university economics professor and champion of 
balanced economic development was named economic planning minister 
analysts said his appointment could signal a shift to more balanced 
distribution of wealth 
former gen lee sanghoon was named defense minister despite 
previous government hints the key ministry would go to a civilian 
lee filled top military posts under chun 
legislator lee handong who ran the governing party under 
chun was made home minister with control of police 
huh hyongkoo a former prosecutorgeneral under chun was 
named justice minister

airmen posing as 
incapacitated astronauts were rescued from a mock smokefilled 
shuttle during a simulated landing for ground crews awaiting 
atlantis return from space 
our purpose is to make sure were ready for the real thing 
whenever it is said chuck spern who directed sundays exercise 
as shuttle recovery convoy commander for the national aeronautics 
and space administration 
nasa and the air force said they would give 24 hours advance 
notice before atlantis and its fivemember crew end a secret 
military mission by touching down at this mojave desert base 80 
miles north of los angeles 
there was no announcement by midday today but sources at cape 
canaveral fla where the shuttle was launched said today that 
atlantis would land tuesday afternoon four days after the mission 
began 
a list of landingrelated tasks displayed during a briefing for 
sundays simulation said the actual landing would be four to seven 
days after the launch 
sundays mock landing was conducted as atlantis astronauts 
continued the classified flight the sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said they successfully deployed what is believed to be 
a 500 million radar satellite that will spy on soviet bloc nations 
and guide the new b2 stealth bomber 
the extra security for the shuttle mission was apparent during 
the simulation the air force refused to let reporters and 
photographers accompany the recovery convoy during a briefing 
before the exercise convoy members were warned not to carry 
personal cameras and to keep radio chatter to a minimum 
about 130 members of the convoy slowly drove some two dozen 
vehicles onto the hard clay of rogers dry lake as the landing 
exercise began they were joined by 50 military police officers 
although 250 will be on hand for the real landing said col rich 
tillstrom the air forces site commander 
a mysterious defense department vehicle accompanied the usual 
convoy vehicles fire trucks vans to transport astronauts and check 
for toxic and explosive gases a trailer with a vapordispersing 
fan the shuttle tow tug and trucks to cool the shuttle and purge 
it of fumes 
spern said only that the vehicle was unique to atlantis 
classified mission lt col jerry guess an air force spokesman 
declined to identify the type of vehicle or its purpose 
about an hour after the convoy headed onto the lakebed 
simulation participants were told the shuttle made a normal landing 
a fullscale shuttle nose cone and crew module hauled atop a truck 
carried airmen portraying astronauts 
then officials controlling the simulation declared a mode six 
emergency in which there is smoke in the cabin and the crew is 
incapacitated they cant see and are having trouble breathing 
spern said 
air force teams then rushed to the mock shuttle extracted the 
fake astronauts carried them on stretchers to a triage area 500 
feet from the nose cone pretended to provide emergency medical care 
and then loaded them on two helicopters for what would be a ride to 
a hospital 
its just practice tillstrom said we go through the same 
checklist and sequence of events we do for a landing plus we take 
the opportunity to practice emergency procedures 
weather forecasts in the mojave appeared favorable for a landing 
with air force meteorologists predicting high scattered clouds 
light and variable wind clear visibility and high temperatures in 
the 60s well into the week 
atlantis which was launched friday on the second postchallenger 
disaster shuttle flight is expected to return to kennedy space 
center in florida about five days after it lands as usual it will 
ride piggyback aboard a modified boeing 747 jet

sparkling white c130s with bright red 
crosses on their sides brought supplies to starving southern 
sudanese on monday in an airlift made possible by relaxed tensions 
in the countrys long civil war 
the airlift organized by the international committee of the red 
cross marked the first time since an antigovernment rebellion 
began in early 1983 that planes flew with guarantees from both sides 
that they wouldnt be shot at 
all of southern sudan an area as large as the state of texas is 
in the grip of famine caused by the war 
during the airlift which began sunday and is openended planes 
flew from khartoum to governmentheld wau the main town of the 
southern bahr elghazal region 625 miles southwest of khartoum 
carrying sorghum butter cooking oil and medical supplies they 
also flew from a kenyan border post to towns under control of the 
sudan peoples liberation army 
simultaneously an operation sponsored by agencies of the united 
nations and the sudanese government also was under way ferrying 
relief on smaller planes to aweil a governmentheld town north of 
wau officials said it too had guarantees from both sides 
western diplomats and un and other relief officials agreed the 
airlifts resulted from a slight relaxation of tensions between the 
two sides in the bitter war 
the clearest evidence is an interim peace agreement signed 
between rebel chieftain john garang and the spiritual leader of the 
ruling coalitions junior partner the democratic unionist party 
the agreement led to a flurry of contacts between the government and 
rebels trying to convene a constitutional convention by the end of 
this month 
despite the green light given by both sides officials said crews 
of the hercules cargo planes were under orders to fly at over 14000 
feet out of the range of rebel gunners and to make circuitous 
landing approaches 
the crew was tense on the first day but everything went all 
right one relief official said monday the planes landed okay 
in wau today as well 
until now prime minister sadek elmahdis government had refused 
to approve any airlifts to rebelheld places 
similarly the sudan peoples liberation army has accused the 
government of using civilian and relief planes to transport military 
equipment they have shot down at least three civilian planes 
killing more than 73 civilians and air traffic over the south has 
been limited almost completely to military aircraft 
preliminary reports from the area indicate the populations of 
both governmentheld towns and those in rebel hands which had 
swelled immensely because of displaced people have begun to shrink 
since the rainy season ended in october 
a un relief official said movement was more difficult during 
the rainy season and the army holds more control over the 
countryside after the rains 
another unfortunate factor is that a lot of these people have 
already died the official said it is never too late but we 
are pretty late 
there are no more daily deaths but we are also about two 
months too late to see the real tragedy another relief official 
said of the town of aweil 
western relief officials estimate at least 260000 people have 
died this year alone as they sought refuge from the fighting 
in 1988 only a few drops of relief went to the south and 
thats why the death toll was so steep one official said we 
hope this breakthrough will open the door for other agencies to go 
in 
all western diplomats and relief workers interviewed refused to 
give their names because of the governments sensitivity about the 
operation and the war 
officials close to the red cross airlift said organizers plan to 
continue the relief effort assuming the security arrangements hold 
until 10000 tons of relief food warehoused in port sudan on the 
countrys red sea coast are distributed 
the kenyan part of the operation is working from lokichokio just 
south of the sudanese border sending food to several rebelheld 
towns on smaller planes 
red cross officials have not divulged the cost of the operation 
but other sources said it is about 2 million the red cross is 
expected to launch an international appeal soon to collect money to 
continue the airlift

thirteen dolphins trained for a secret navy 
program have died in the last two years rather than the four 
disclosed by trainers last month according to government records 
cited by the seattle postintelligencer 
medical reports for the navys marine mammal program during 
198688 reveal that five of the 13 dolphins died soon after being 
transported from one naval facility to another the newspaper 
reported monday 
nearly half the dolphins suffered from lack of appetite or 
stomach ulcers before their deaths the reports revealed other 
causes included hepatitis and pneumonia 
the navy has used dolphins sea lions and beluga whales in 
classified programs since the 1960s and is planning to expand the 
use of dolphins for security at the trident submarine base at 
bangor west of seattle 
the army corps of engineers granted a permit on nov 17 for the 
navy to build 16 dolphin holding pens at a pier on hood canal 
the service has come under sharp criticism since several trainers 
reported nov 2 that the animals had suffered physical abuse and 
that the program suffered from mismanagement rapid employee 
turnover and pressure to expand 
the navy released the dolphin necropsy or animal autopsy reports 
for 198688 to the postintelligencer under the federal freedom of 
information act the newspaper said each time a marine mammal in 
its custody dies the navy is required to conduct a necropsy to find 
the cause 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley said that when 
officials earlier confirmed the deaths of four dolphins they were 
not trying to cover up the deaths of others 
we responded to questions from reporters seeking confirmation 
about the four deaths quigley said 
the navy said it had no reports of dolphins being injured by 
trainers or navy operators said navy capt eg schweizer 
commander of the naval ocean systems center 
however rick trout a san diegobased dolphin trainer claimed 
that in addition to minor physical abuse and adversive training

a social security official assured congress 
today that the agency has permanently shelved a controversial 
proposal to restrict peoples rights to appeal benefit denials 
the staff proposal has been tossed said louis enoff deputy 
commissioner for programs at the social security administration it 
will not be considered or officially be brought forward in the 
social security administration 
enoff testified today at a house ways and means committee hearing 
that was scheduled before social security commissioner dorcas hardy 
killed the proposal over the weekend 
the committee chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill said the 
hearing was held anyway because the thrust of the plan had been 
contrary to congressional intent that the appeals process be 
nonadversarial and simple enough for an individual claimant to 
navigate without legal representation 
rep tom downey acting chairman of the panels public assistance 
subcommittee said the hearing on a draft proposal already withdrawn 
went forward in part because the reagan administration does not 
have a track record on social security that i feel comfortable with 
theres suspicion 
on saturday hardy rejected the proposal which would have 
required claimants to submit all evidence in advance of their appeal 
hearing 
most of the 300000 people who request hearings each year before 
administrative law judges are seeking disability benefits and most 
who appeal denials eventually win 
its great that they decided not to go forward with the 
proposal said eileen p sweeney of the national senior citizens 
law center but she called it basically a political decision and 
said it was fairly disingenuous of social security officials to 
claim that the proposal had emanated from low levels of the agency 
without the knowledge of hardy or other top officials 
hardy said in a fourpage statement released saturday that the 
draft had generated inaccurate information and caused undue alarm 
to the american public 
she said she remains convinced that the agencys hearings and 
appeals process needs reform but that the staffsuggested proposal 
would not have made the system more equitable compassionate and 
efficient 
the furor erupted last month when the new york times reported 
that the reagan administration was considering restricting the right 
of social security applicants to introduce new evidence upon appeal 
thirtyfive senators including one republican dave durenberger 
of minnesota sent a letter to presidentelect george bush last week 
urging him to repudiate the policy change 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said he was pleased with 
hardys decision and hopes to work with the commissioner on 
improving the system 
it takes an average of nearly two years to appeal a claim through 
the administrative process to the federal courts 
hardy said 80 percent of social security beneficiaries now are 
represented by lawyers at hearings before administrative law judges 
and the agency each year pays almost 100 million in fees to 
attorneys out of the past due benefits of claimants who win benefits 
on appeal 
the proposal drafted by the agencys office of hearings and 
appeals would have required claimants to submit all evidence at 
least seven days prior to a hearing before an administrative law 
judge 
the controversy hit at a time when hardy is under consideration 
for the post of secretary of health and human services in the bush 
administration 
hardy said that because confidence in our policymaking process 
has been questioned i removed the draft proposal from the routine 
process and personally reviewed it 
i believe that ssa the social security administration can do 
better and have therefore rejected it she said 
sweeney an advocate for the elderly poor and disabled said the 
158page draft proposal was described as part of social securitys 
highest priority regulatory agency for 1989 in one deputy 
commissioners memo just a month ago 
now she said they characterize it as a lowlevel 
brainstorming idea thats completely disingenuous and probably 
false 
disability benefit cutoffs caused an uproar and created hardship 
in the early years of the reagan administration which reviewed the 
cases of more than 1 million disability beneficiaries and ordered 
more than 40 percent off the rolls many of those affected had 
qualified on the basis of mental problems 
most won reinstatement and congress and the administration 
subsequently eased up on the reviews

catholic churches nationwide will take up a 
special collection this weekend to help support increasing numbers 
of retired nuns and priests church officials say 
most religious communities cannot afford the estimated 10000 
annual cost of caring for an elderly member of a religious order 
because the number of young clergy men and women who provide 
financial support is dwindling they said 
the lilly endowment inc based in indianapolis is assisting the 
project 
without the special collections some religious orders may have 
to break up and sell their property said sister mary luke jones 
development director for our lady of grace monastery in beech grove 
sister mary margaret funk the monasterys prioress said the 
100member community ended the last fiscal year with a deficit 
typical of those reported nationwide about 250000 
financial problems in religious communities didnt develop 
overnight men and women worked for years with low salaries and no 
money set aside by the church for their retirements 
sister jane bodine of the sisters of providence said many nuns 
received only 1000 a year until the 1970s and sister mary 
margaret noted that the benedictines did not start making social 
security payments for members until 1972 social security pays a 
retired nun about 2500 a year she said 
the sisters of providence based at st maryofthewoods near 
terre haute has 850 members more than onethird of them are older 
than 70 
the retirement collections will be conducted each december for 10 
years donations will be sent to the triconference retirement fund 
for men and women religious in washington dc 
that office through a lilly endowment grant will provide 
management and financial planning assistance for religious 
communities with unfunded retirement fund liabilities 
the triconference retirement fund was set up in 1987 by the 
national conference of catholic bishops the leadership conference 
of women religious and the conference of major superiors of men 
after the depth of the crisis was discovered a study indicated 
there would be a 3 billion shortfall even if all assets of 
religious communities were used for retirement needs

selenium at levels high enough to 
poison millions of highrisk americans has been found in food from 
supermarkets across the country according to a newspapers 
sevenmonth investigation 
toxic concentrations of selenium also taint the homegrown food 
and drinking water of hundreds perhaps thousands of farm and ranch 
families in several western states the sacramento bee reported 
sunday 
selenium is a naturally occurring gray nonmetallic chemical 
element of the sulphur group its levels in commercial foods are 
high enough to expose even healthy adults to levels above federal 
guidlines the newspaper said 
the potential effects for healthy adults may be nothing worse 
than slight declines in overall health or resistance to disease and 
infection 
but for those living in the rural west and highrisk groups 
across the nation the very young old and the chronically ill 
the effects can be much more serious including severe digestive 
problems kidney or liver damage paralysis even death the 
newspaper said 
the bee said its first set of tests established a clear danger to 
rural families in oregon montana south dakota nebraska wyoming 
colorado and nevada the second set turned up elevated selenium in 
supermarket foods in seven american cities sacramento chicago 
washington dc atlanta great falls mont rapid city sd and 
montrose colo 
the findings were based on laboratory analyses of more than 200 
water meat fish egg cereal grain and dairy product samples and 
on interviews with dozens of selenium victims their doctors public 
health experts and toxicologists 
dr jean pennington a nutritionist for the food and drug 
administration told the bee that she doubts people are getting 
unsafe levels of selenium if they eat an average diet pennington 
questioned the diet chosen by the bee as typical for its study but 
said there is the chance that more than adequate amounts will be 
consumed by some people and too much could be unhealthy 
the highest average selenium levels in the bees survey came from 
a sacramento supermarket twelve foods were chosen at random 
including beefsteak and beef liver chicken breast and liver pork 
chop and sausage tuna fish sardines cornmeal wheat cereal whole 
wheat bread and eggs 
fda studies averaged samples over an entire year leading to 
significantly lower exposure numbers according to the bee 
jonathan deason director of the interior departments study of 
tainted agricultural drainage from federal water projects in the 
west said there really isnt any major public health problems 
that we have identified 
selenium has killed or deformed thousands of fish waterfowl and 
other wildlife at kesterson national wildlife refuge in californias 
central agricultural valley similar effects have been confirmed by 
federal studies in other parts of california and in nevada utah and 
wyoming 
although the us interior department is studying the selenium 
threat to wildlife no agency is studying its toxic effect on 
people the bee said 
selenium enters the human food chain from thousands of square 
miles of seleniumtainted soil in the west by being added to 
livestock and poultry feed and through the vigorous marketing by 
nutrition companies of selenium as a dietary supplement 
people could get no more than a good bellyache from a single 
high exposure or get very very sick from prolonged intake said 
dr arthur kilness a researcher on selenium and a retired south 
dakota surgeon 
according to the newspapers study 
a healthy adult would surpass the federal food and drug 
administrations safe selenium level 200 micrograms by eating 
two sixounce servings of the sampled foods a day those servings 
averaged 105 micrograms 
a weekly menu prepared from the foods yielded seven straight 
days of intake averaging 410 micrograms the national academy of 
science the national institutes of health and others have stated 
that healthy adults suffer adverse effects above 500 micrograms 
five of 11 samples of baby food exceeded the safe level of 40 
micrograms for infants one fourounce serving of oatmeal cereal had 
83 micrograms so far no government or health agency has determined 
the toxic level for infants 
doctors agree that sudden high doses of selenium can cause 
lethal effects deaths have resulted in england and the united 
states from acute industrial exposure to selenium and in china from 
tainted food 
but much less is known about chronic longterm exposure to lower 
concentrations 
i doubt seriously that doctors know enough to recognize the 
symptoms of selenium poisoning in humans said dr bruce furst 
professor emeritus at the university of san francisco where he has 
spent 30 years studying the toxic and cancerous effects of trace 
metals 
it is such a recent problem and up to now most of those who 
have looked at this whole issue have spent too much time on 
deficiencies of a lot of trace elements but not enough on their 
toxicity

president reagan and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev have nurtured a tough yet courteous relationship 
during their years of summitry while their wives rivalry has 
evolved into the soap opera of the ussoviet sessions 
nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev are scheduled to meet for the 
final time in their official roles on wednesday when marcella perez 
de cuellar wife of the un secretarygeneral hosts a luncheon 
the two superpower leaders also will be meeting in new york 
press attention for mrs gorbachev is certain to be fierce the 
soviets have sent advance word that she is determined to mix with 
christmas shoppers at such bastions of capitalist consumerism as 
macys during her stay in new york and in the past such publicity 
hasnt pleased the us first lady 
the friction between the two women is described by former reagan 
administration chief of staff donald t regan who wrote in his 
book for the record of the womens first encounter in geneva 
in 1985 
the two smiled for the cameras over their teacups but regan 
claimed that mrs reagan was unprepared to deal with the 
stylish handsome woman with an intense and intelligent manner 
mrs reagan did not take kindly to the former university 
professors attempt to indoctrinate president reagan in the fine 
points of marxistleninist theory the chief of staff said 
mrs reagan chafed under the monologue after the door had 
closed behind the gorbachevs she said who does that dame think 
she is regan wrote 
the chief of staff whose own runins with mrs reagan led to his 
dismissal said that subsequent tension between the two women 
probably traces from that first encounter as well as the the 
extraordinary amount of press coverage that mrs gorbachev 
collected in her dashes about geneva 
despite their differences the two women have tried repeatedly 
and unsuccessfully to reach a rapprochement 
during the washington summit mrs reagan extended an invitation 
to mrs gorbachev to have tea and tour the white house but the 
soviet first ladys response was long in coming and then she asked 
if the session could be rescheduled so that she might attend a 
meeting between her husband and us publishers and editors 
at the white house mrs gorbachev peppered mrs reagan with 
questions about the trappings and history of the mansion leaving 
the first lady speechless at times and admitting im afraid im 
not much help 
when the moscow summit came nancy revealed shed learned her 
lesson 
at first the two women made a great show of holding hands and 
conversing intimately as they strolled about touring the golden 
churches of the kremlin 
but the facade faded when they came together during a visit to an 
icon vault 
after speaking at length about the invaluable russian art 
collection its message about the russian soul and quoting the 
russian author feodor dostoevsky mrs gorbachev attempted to cut 
reporters off when they tried to speak with mrs reagan 
i want to say something i want to say something ok mrs 
reagan interrupted sharply and her soviet hostess retreated as the 
first lady went on to discuss the religious implication of the 
artwork 
in an interview published nov 13 in the los angeles times 
prior to the announcement of another encounter with the soviet first 
lady mrs reagan was asked if she found mrs gorbachev to be rude 
by our standards i suppose yes mrs reagan replied 
adding now by her standards it might not be 
its just coming from two completely different cultures and 
trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not 
understanding how the other works the first lady said

a car bomb exploded monday across from a 
hospital in moslem west beirut killing one pedestrian and injuring 
six destroying cars and hurling patients from their beds police 
and witnesses said 
a second car bomb exploded near a syrian army checkpoint in the 
easten bekaa valley injuring three people police said 
no one claimed responsibility for the attacks 
a police spokesman said a gray peugeot packed with an estimated 
110 pounds of tnt exploded across the street from baydoun hospital 
in west beiruts sanayeh residential district 
none of the troops manning a syrian checkpoint about 75 yards 
from the hospital was injured said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified under standing briefing rules 
syrian soldiers nervously cordoned off the hospital area as 
ambulances with sirens wailing rushed the victims to the american 
unversity hospital about six blocks away 
a nurse at the hospital said the force of the blast hurled most 
of the hospitals 36 patients out of bed as shrapnel tore through 
the windows 
luckily there were no surgeries under way in the operating 
theater said the nurse who refused to give her name the 
explosion would have definitely shaken the hands of the surgeons 
which could have affected the lives of the patients 
three cars parked in front of the hospital which is one block 
from lebanons central bank and near the prime ministry were burned 
into smoldering piles of metal 
police said the other car bomb exploded at 130 am in an olive 
green mercedes near a syrian checkpoint in the village of saadnayel 
24 miles east of beirut in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley 
police estimated the car that blew up in the village also 
contained 110 pounds of tnt injured were two lebanese in a passing 
car and a palestinian bystander police said 
the two blasts brought to 20 the number of car bombings in 
lebanon this year police say 115 people have been killed and 279 
wounded in 18 bombings since april 23 
many of the bombings have been aimed at syrian targets among the 
wounded have been 23 syrian troops 
no one has claimed responsibility for any of the bombings but 
the syrians have blamed them on rightwing lebanese christians 
fighting against syrianbacked moslems and leftists in lebanons 
13yearold civil war 
in other developments monday 
syria withdrew six military observers who have been monitoring 
a ceasefire between palestinian guerrillas and shiite moslem 
militiamen east of south lebanons port city of sidon for 19 months 
police said the move triggered fears of a new round of fighting 
between yasser arafats palestine liberation organization guerrillas 
and nabih berris mainstream shiite amal militia for control of the 
highlands overlooking a palestinian refugee camp east of sidon 
israel released and returned three lebanese shiite moslem 
teenagers seized sunday in a motorboat off the southern lebanese 
port of tyre by an israeli gunboat police here theorized the three 
were mistaken for guerrillas on an infiltration mission

a year after concluding an arms treaty with the 
united states mikhail s gorbachev is heading for a meeting with 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush to help set the 
pace for future arms talks 
during the soviet presidents trip which begins tuesday he will 
address the united nations and visit cuba and britain trying to 
polish his image as a statesman and dispel the image of the soviet 
union as an enemy 
it was gorbachevs luncheon meeting in new york with reagan and 
bush planned for wednesday that the official media emphasized in 
its reports monday 
tass called the meeting is an extraordinary event because 
superpower relations are a determining factor for the very essence 
of the world process 
it is perfectly natural that the new administration will need 
some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and 
international problems but it is very important not to drag out 
this period tass said 
marking time in international affairs especially in the domain 
of arms limitation and reduction is tantamount not only to loss of 
time but to backsliding it said 
on dec 8 1987 gorbachev and reagan signed an agreement to 
eliminate their medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
but progress in talks to cut the two sides arsenals of strategic 
weapons slowed to a crawl because of the us election campaign and 
problems including continued differences over reagans star wars 
program for a spacebased defense against nuclear attack 
the government newspaper izvestia in a frontpage article from 
new york on monday said the us administration was preparing 
intensively for the meeting with gorbachev there is a basis to 
suppose that the administration will not only listen but propose 
something in return the paper said 
gorbachev has said he is seeking improved relations with the west 
in order to free up resources to improve the standard of living of 
soviet citizens 
one western analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soviet union doesnt have the resources to sustain the investment 
its been making in foreign aid and defense 
despite gorbachevs drive for perestroika or restructuring 
soviet citizens have seen no improvement in the quality or quantity 
of food and consumer goods and there is a pervasive feeling that 
things actually have worsened 
a survey by a moscow sociological research institute earlier this 
fall found that only 2 percent of workers interviewed thought their 
lives had improved significantly under gorbachev 
soviet sources said the presssure to devote more resources to 
domestic needs means gorbachev will try to end to the enemy 
image he also will try to convince fidel castro in cuba that it 
is time to deemphasize the revolutionary movement in latin america 
izvestia in an apparent effort to make the point about the new 
image gorbachev is trying to project pointedly reminded readers 
monday of an episode in which former leader nikita s khrushchev 
pounded his shoe on a table at the united nations in 1960 
without naming khrushchev the paper said many still recall how 
our leader looked then in the hall of the general assembly how he 
jumped up from his place trying to interrupt speakers he didnt 
like pounded his fist on the table and not only his fist 
in his talks with castro gorbachev will emphasize that the 
soviet union will no longer encourage communist revolutions in latin 
america said one soviet expert on latin america 
we are now saying human values take precedence over class 
values said the expert who spoke on condition of anonymity we 
are no longer supporting class wars or socialist revolutions in 
latin america we are not against class struggle but we are saying 
it should not dominate international relations we are not going to 
get involved

mohammad ali besharati the iranian official told a news 
conference at his countrys embassy in moslem west beirut 
it will be most regrettable for us to hear that the four 
missing iranians who all had diplomatic status are dead but this 
will not prevent us from persisting in our humanitarian efforts to 
free the western hostages in line with our islamic principles we 
refuse to allow any threat against the lives of innocents 
besharatis comment was the first public acknowledgment by iran 
that the men may be dead 
among iranian leaders offering help with the hostages was hashemi 
rafsanjani the parliament speaker and military commander who 
addressed this statement to washington last month 
if you are interested in having your people held hostage in 
lebanon released then tell the christian phalangists to release 
our people who have been in their hands for years 
the missing iranians are ahmad motevaselian commander of iranian 
revolutionary guards based in the bekaa valley of eastern lebanon 
charge daffaires hussein musavi kazem akhavan a correspondent of 
irans official islamic republic news agency and rastegar moqadam 
a lebanese shiite driver with an iranian passport 
they were seized at a checkpoint 25 miles north of beirut in july 
1982 during the israeli invasion of lebanon the checkpoint at the 
northern tip of the christian enclave was controlled by the lebanese 
forces the main christian militia 
we shall continue to make efforts to free the hostages 
besharati said adding some of the captors do sympathize with us 
and we dont know about the others perhaps our efforts will 
influence both groups 
at its annual conference the federation of arab news agencies 
discussed the question of terry andersons continued abduction and 
resolved that this is hampering the publication of arab news abroad 
and curbing the freedom of the press in general secretarygeneral 
farid ayyar said in a statement 
we appeal to terry andersons holders to reconsider their 
position because the ap bureau chief was conducting a professional 
mission without any involvement in the existing conflicts he said 
ayyar issued the statement after returning from federations 17th 
annual meeting in damascus capital of syria seventeen arab news 
agencies belong to the group 
besharati arrived in beirut on sunday after two days of talks 
with syrian officials in damascus and met with lebanese leaders in 
beirut before the news conference 
he said the main purpose of his trip was to reconcile lebanons 
two warring shiite militias the prosyrian amal and the hezbollah 
or party of god which is loyal to iran and believed to be an 
umbrella group for the kidnappers 
the two factions are vying for dominance among lebanons 1 
million shiites and fought a sixday street battle in west and south 
beirut that was stopped a week ago by syrian troops 
syria has about 25000 soldiers stationed in northern and eastern 
lebanon and about 7500 in the moslem sectors of beirut 
besharati appears to be the iranian official in charge of 
relations with lebanese shiites he was involved in an agreement 
that ended a round of amalhezbollah fighting in may

a former united auto workers official is 
still fighting to win pension benefits for workers who lost their 
jobs when the studebaker corp shut down 25 years ago 
as long as i have breath in my body i will continue says 
odell duke newburn former president of uaw local 5 
almost 6000 workers lost their pensions when studebaker locked 
the gates to its south bend factory dec 20 1963 many had at least 
10 years of service but lost out because the companys pension plan 
was not fully funded 
in 1975 a federal law was enacted requiring companies to 
purchase federal insurance to protect pensions but that didnt help 
the studebaker workers 
we were the cause of pensions being secured but no laws were 
made retroactive back to them said newburn they forgot those 
who made that law possible 
a bill to help those workers and others who have lost pensions 
has been introduced annually in congress since 1979 but has made 
little progress newburn said 
newburn continues to speak in support of the measure and fields 
questions about it almost daily from former studebaker workers i 
tell them the issue isnt dead and that someone is still working on 
it he said 
karen friedman education director of the pension rights center 
a washington lobbying group said the measure would have helped 
about 83000 people and cost 40 a million a year had it been 
enacted in 1979 the cost would diminish annually as deaths reduce 
the number of recipients she said

jack and alice james believe in the magic 
of christmas 
the thousands of letters to santa claus that come into this 
little central florida community each year are personally answered 
by the couple with postcards that bear the simple message lots of 
love santa 
for the past two decades the jameses have mailed out the 
handwritten postcards on a scale that even santa claus would admire 
they expect to send out around 2000 this season at a cost of 300 
for postage alone 
we love christmas and we have a great time reading the 
letters said alice james 61 
because the us postal service lets each post office make its 
own arrangements for santa mail many of the letters are simply 
routed to this community between orlando and the kennedy space 
center that thrives on its name 
the couple say there is nothing like getting a thankyou note for 
santa or hearing about a child who treasures his santa postcard 
like a 2yearold did last year 
his mother said that from the moment he got it he slept with 
it he held onto it all day by the time christmas got there his 
santa postcard was a mess said mrs james laughing 
thats what makes it all worthwhile

plo chairman yasser arafat is to meet a 
group of prominent american jews on tuesday a foreign ministry 
spokesman announced 
members of the group asked that their names remain secret until 
after the talks with the leader of the palestine liberation 
organization said the spokesman martin hallqvist 
they represent a significant part of jewish opinion in the 
united states hallqvist said 
the foreign ministry said the meeting was part of swedens effort 
to help the peace process in the middle east 
a spokesman for the israeli embassy said the foreign ministry had 
informed the mission of the planned meeting shortly before the 
announcement was made hallqvist said the encounter was planned two 
weeks ago when khaled hassan the chairman of the plo foreign 
affairs committee met representatives of a jewish group in 
stockholm 
in paris prime minister ingvar carlsson said he was cutting 
short his visit to france and canceling a meeting with president 
francois mitterrand to be in sweden for the arafat visit 
carlsson said this is a meeting between two parties which have 
had difficulties talking or in communication the swedish government 
has been able to help them to meet 
israeli officials refuse to meet members of the plo which they 
say is a terrorist organization and they have discouraged us jews 
from holding such talks 
in jerusalem a foreign ministry statement said israel 
expressed stupefication that arafat would be received by 
highranking swedish officials and warned it would be extremely 
damaging if the talks went ahead it voiced astonishment over 
the likely meeting with us jews 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson has condemned secretary 
of state george shultzs decision to deny arafat a us entry visa 
so he could address the un general assembly during its debate on 
palestine 
andersson called shultzs move unwise unreasonable and 
untimely 
the un debate was rescheduled for dec 1315 in geneva the 
first time the general assembly will meet outside the united states 
in the united nations 43year history 
sweden has welcomed the declaration of an independent palestinian 
state by the palestine national council the palestinian 
parliamentinexile but it has not joined about 60 other countries 
that granted the plo diplomatic recognition 
on saturday andersson said swedens solidarity with israel 
will continue with undiminished strength but he urged israel 
to take the plos extended hand and begin peace negotiations

nicaraguan president daniel ortega canceled a 
trip to the united nations on monday saying the united states had 
placed unacceptable restrictions on his travel and on the size of 
his party 
the united states has violated international norms and its 
promises to the united nations and has broken the principles of the 
united nations ortega told a news conference 
ortega in mexico for the inauguration of president carlos 
salinas de gortari said he had been planning to fly to new york to 
discuss the latest central american peace initiative and to plead 
for aid for his hurricane battered country 
us officials noted that the united states had issued expedited 
visas for ortega his wife his son and 15 other nicaraguans the 
united states turned down the visas of 14 other people because they 
were not submitted 15 days before the trip 
now we guaranteed his right to come to the united nations but 
we did not guarantee his right to bring unlimited numbers of people 
with him nor did we guarantee his right to tourism in the united 
states said vernon walters us ambassador to the united nations 
ortega said the united states limited his travels to four 
boroughs of new york city which he said would prevent him from 
visiting the home of the nicaraguan ambassador to the united 
nations who lives outside that area 
he said the united states had no right to decide when how and 
with whom a chief of state can visit an international organization 
like the united nations 
in new york walters said that a lot of people take less than 
30 people from a lot larger countries than nicaragua 
secondly mr ortega came up the last time to the united 
nations and he was jogging in the park buying glasses and speaking 
in denver colorado and other places 
ortega said he had hoped to describe the extensive damage done in 
nicaragua by hurricane joan in october and plead for international 
help 
he said he also wanted to confer with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar about a new proposal for the united nations 
to participate in verifying a central american peace accord 
us officials said ortega had planned to meet with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who will address the un general 
assembly and will meet with president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush 
ortega said that us policy in central america had been a 
failure during the reagan administration 
reagan came into office intending to finish nicaragua and the 
revolution in el salvador said ortega in january when reagan 
leaves office well still be there and hell be leaving behind an 
explosive situation in el salvador where the guerrillas are 
stronger than they ever were 
ortega said he saw no prospect of renewed negotiations with 
contra guerrillas because the guerrillas are not interested 
he also rejected criticisms by mexican leftists who had said 
ortega and cuban president fidel castro were supporting an 
illegitimate government by attending salinas inauguration 
if they play the electoral game he said they shouldnt 
cry about the results

beijing is officially turning to the right despite 
the governments leftist ideology 
municipal traffic officials already have banned left turns at 150 
intersections in an effort to reduce snarls and plan to outlaw all 
left turns everywhere in the capital by the end of 1989 the 
official china daily said monday 
to ensure there will be no turning back from the rightist course 
the city will be designating almost all streets oneway only the 
paper said 
although hardly any chinese have their own cars growing numbers 
of offices and enterprises are buying vehicles roads once used 
mainly by bicyclists are jammed daily by cars trucks jeeps and 
threewheeled vehicles of all kinds that creep at an average pace of 
about 12 mph 
the china daily quoted traffic officials as saying the 
rightturnonly policy already has reduced jams at intersections 
where it is enforced 
an informal poll of taxi drivers however say rigid rightism 
applied to traffic makes no more sense than extreme leftism did in 
the 1960s when revolutionaryminded officials decided to make red 
stand for go and green for stop in traffic lights 
traffic officials have not created alternate means for drivers to 
get to their leftward destinations such as overpasses instead 
most drivers turn right and then try to turn around in the side 
road creating little jams of cars making uturns

soweto with a population of 25 million is the main black 
township outside johannesburg 
the need is tremendous at this stage in terms of black 
housing meyer said we can provide for the black community in a 
better way than weve done so far 
an average of 15 to 20 people live in each of sowetos 130000 
housing units according to most estimates most of the homes have 
only four rooms 
there is a severe housing shortage in black areas and an 
estimated 7 million of the countrys 26 million blacks are 
squatters although a housing surplus exists in white areas 
under the countrys apartheid policies all neighborhoods are 
segregated by race and blacks have no voice in national affairs 
controlled by the 5 million whites 
the extremeright conservative party condemned the governments 
decision saying it would attract more blacks to urban areas 
this will be another example of the governments policy of 
unorderly urbanization said olaus van zyl a conservative member 
of parliament

the head of the church of scientology 
international remains in prison without bail pending pending further 
investigation of charges of fraud criminal association and tax 
evasion a court clerk said monday 
judge jose maria vazquez honrubia does not plan to set bail for 
heber jentzsch of los angeles whom he ordered jailed nov 23 the 
clerk said 
the judge has no intention of freeing him on bail said the 
clerk who spoke on condition of anonymity she said vazquez 
honrubia had at least three months before he was legally required to 
file formal charges against jentzsch 
jentzsch 53 has been held at the carabanchel prison outside 
madrid together with 10 others who were arrested in a raid nov 20 
after questioning all 71 people arrested in the raid vazquez 
honrubia expelled 10 foreigners and released 50 others 
the clerk said vazquez honrubia was still preparing charges based 
on his ninemonth investigation into the activities of the church of 
scientology and narconon a churchlinked drug rehabilitation 
program that the judge said swindled its clients and lured them into 
scientology 
scientology officials in madrid said jentzsch had nothing to do 
with church finances and could not have committed crimes in spain 
since he had never been in the country before november 
the absolute truth above good or bad is that heber works a 
job similar to that of ambassador said andrea hoden a los 
angelesbased church official he does not handle financial or 
administrative matters 
the church of scientology founded in the 1950s by science 
fiction author and former us navy officer l ron hubbard is based 
on writings published in hubbards 1949 book dianetics the 
modern science of mental health 
followers strive toward a clear state by using a lie 
detectortype device called an emeter coupled with exercise 
and counseling 
hubbard held the position of founder and executive director of 
the church and jentzsch is president ms hoden said 
she said church of scientology officials had offered through 
jentzschs spanish lawyers to sort out responsibility for possible 
wrongdoings but vazquez honrubia had refused to release details of 
the alleged charges and denied church lawyers access to documents 
seized in the raid 
what we thought was a tragic mistake has now turned into a 
human rights violation ms hoden said 
vazquez honrubia said authorities had frozen 176 million in 
bank accounts belonging to officials of the church and narconon 
because the money had not been declared to tax authorities 
he said his madrid district court 21 had been flooded with 
calls from spaniards who said they had been swindled by narconon he 
said he planned to hand over the case to a court with national 
jurisdiction once he had completed compiling the results of his 
investigation 
the justice ministry has twice denied the church of scientology 
status as a religious entity 
ms hoden appeared at a press conference monday with american 
opera singer julia migenes who denounced jentzschs imprisonment as 
a great error 
migenes described herself as a scientologist and a close friend 
of jentzsch who she said was a man of great dreams great 
qualities and honesty 
migenes said she had filed a formal complaint with the un human 
rights commission asking the genevabased body to investigate the 
arrest and imprisonment of jentzsch 
another scientologist and friend of jentzsch jazz pianist chick 
corea appeared in madrid nov 26 to defend the jailed leader

presidentelect carlos andres perez 
said monday that his country should strengthen diplomatic ties with 
cuba and include it in efforts to promote latin american integration 
even with our unsolvable ideological differences because of 
cubas position in the communist world we should normalize 
relations with cuba perez said at his first news conference since 
declaring victory in sundays election 
cuba and venezuela withdrew ambassadors in 1980 in a dispute over 
a dissident cuban tried in venezuela for sabotage 
perez has not yet been officially elected but all exit polls 
showed him winning decisively over his nearest rival eduardo 
fernandez who conceded defeat partial returns show him with 52 
percent of the vote 
perez 66 succeeds jaime lusinchi also of the leftofcenter 
democratic action party as venezuelas leader for the next five 
years 
perez who takes office in february has set as his first task 
renegotiating the nations 33 billion debt with foreign banks the 
debt is the fourthlargest in latin america after brazil mexico and 
argentina 
perez believes he is the man to lead a latin american drive to 
set new terms on the regional debt crisis and he promised to meet 
other regional leaders to work out negotiations 
we do not want to enter into confrontations with creditor 
nations but it is indispensable to open a dialogue in which our 
terms are heard he said 
referring to a trade promoting pact signed recently between 
argentina and brazil he said venezuela and mexico should initiate 
this process this is our challenge 
perez said he cannot conceive of any regional pact to control 
drug trafficking that would exclude cuba 
it is better for all of us if cuba subjects itself to 
international obligations isolationist measures are out of place 
now he said 
he said he intends to continue efforts to move panama toward 
democracy perez was part of a negotiating process seeking the exit 
of gen manuel antonio noriega of panama and claims the process 
failed when the united states imposed economic sanctions 
i will continue to cooperate for a definitive solution in 
panama so that elections there next year can be a serious road to 
democratization he said 
he said he will be going to kuwait and other persian gulf states 
to promote a meeting of opec heads of state 
venezuela depends on oil for 90 percent of its export earnings 
and has seen those earnings slump dramatically in the last few years 
with the fall in oil prices 
although perez has not been officially declared the winner of 
sundays vote the supreme electoral councils third bulletin gave 
perez 52 percent out of 439445 votes or 5 percent of the 
electorate that had been counted by midday 
his nearest challenger fernandez had 385 percent of the votes 
counted the council said

participated

nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan ethnic armenians who are the 
majority in the region are demanding it be annexed by armenia

officials in nagornokarabakh have thrown many ethnic azerbaijanis 
out of work and have deprived azerbaijani families of food and 
medical supplies

republican bob michel of illinois pledged today 
to pursue tougher ethics policies as he was reelected house 
minority leader the democrats meanwhile voted for the first time 
to put a black into their top leadership 
michel delivered a shot at the democratic leadership of the house 
over the past decade 
speaker jim wright dtexas was running unopposed for a second 
twoyear term and he was assured of reelection to his post by 
fellow democrats later today despite an inquiry into allegations of 
unethical behavior in his personal finances and his handling of 
government secrets 
the reputation of this institution has been smeared by members 
who blatantly break our rules and mock the institutions inability 
to enforce a penalty michel told fellow gop lawmakers who 
elected him to a fifth twoyear term as their leader he was 
unopposed 
michel did not mention wright by name but made it clear that the 
republicans intend to pursue the inquiry against the speaker which 
they initiated the house ethics committee is investigating the 
charges against wright 
i believe we must more clearly define our ethics rules and 
then we have to enforce them he said the record of enforcement 
in this house is a national disgrace 
the principal contested races on each side were for the largely 
ceremonial tasks of presiding over party meetings 
rep william h gray iii the chairman of the house budget 
committee won the post of democratic caucus chairman over rep mary 
rose oakar dohio who has been vice chairman of the caucus and 
rep mike synar dokla the vote was 146 for gray 80 for ms 
oakar and 33 for synar 
gray becomes the first black to climb that high in the leadership 
structure according to house historians if ms oakar had won she 
would set the standard for a woman in the house 
the hottest republican race saw rep jerry lewis of california 
edge out rep lynn martin of illinois for the chairmanship of the 
house republican conference the counterpart to the democratic 
caucus lewis won in a runoff by a vote of 8582 after rep bill 
dannemeyer rcalif was third and dropped out following the first 
ballot 
if ms martin had won she would have broken new ground for a 
house gop woman 
the democrats saw no major changes in their leadership as 
majority leader thomas s foley dwash and majority whip tony 
coelho dcalif who were first elected to those posts two years 
ago are returning to face a new president together 
the team is together said coelho 
to start 1987 the democratic leaders came forward with an 
aggressive agenda to counter the reagan administration this time 
they are holding back to give george bush a chance to offer his own 
plans 
we welcome his getting on the wagon on issues such as child 
care and the environment and we intend to see what he wants to 
do coelho said 
on the republican side michel the minority leader for eight 
years served with bush in the house the new president will have 
another ally in rep dick cheney rwyo who moved up a rung on the 
gop ladder to fill the slot of minority whip the no 2 slot is 
being vacated by trent lott of mississippi who was elected to the 
senate 
democratic rep steny hoyer of maryland was running unopposed for 
oakars old job as vice chairman of the democratic caucus 
the current democratic caucus chairman rep richard a gephardt 
of missouri will be appointed a deputy whip coelho said that 
would allow the former presidential candidate to retain a say in 
leadership decisions in the house david bonior of michigan will 
remain coelhos chief deputy 
in addition to electing officers both parties will begin vying 
for changes in the house rules for the new congress that might give 
them an advantage in legislative struggle 
democratic rep charles stenholm dtexas is being opposed by 
his own party leadership in his quest to force disclosure of the 
beneficiaries of specialinterest provisions in legislation 
the proposal would require the listing of the name of each 
beneficiary the cost to taxpayers of the provision and the name of 
the lawmaker who sponsored it 
stenholm contends it would sae members of congress embarrassment 
later but the primary spending and taxwriting panels oppose the 
plan

government investigators monday blamed ice on the 
wings of an italian airliner and the flight crews reaction for a 
crash that killed 37 people last year 
nine people including french and italian airline officials were 
indicted in october on manslaughter charges from the oct 15 1987 
crash of a twinengine turboprop atr42 operated by the ati 
subsidiary of italys staterun alitalia 
the plane carrying mostly west germans crashed shortly after 
takeoff on a flight from milan to cologne 
a government report published monday said the first event leading 
to the crash was the formation of ice that altered the aerodynamic 
profile of the wings 
the ice made one wing fall in an unusual action that the crew 
almost certainly attributed to a malfunction in the automatic pilot 
instead of a stall it said 
the report contends sharp manuevers by the crew to raise the wing 
increased the longitudinal roll of the plane and kept the pilot from 
taking timely corrective action 
investigators said the crew was not effectively sensitized to the 
phenomenon or the importance of procedures 
it should have increased takeoff speed and reduced the angle of 
ascent because of the iceforming conditions instead the plane 
stalled at a speed faster than normal for takeoff and at a lower 
than usual angle of ascent 
earlier investigators said the planes operation and flight 
manuals did not contain instructions to handle icing 
but enzo pacia lawyer for plane designer jean rech said last 
month the plane has an antiicing system conforming with 
international norms and the flight manuals and other technical 
instruments are suitable so the plane can be flown without risk in 
any weather conditions 
the indictments named rech a frenchman and an official of 
aerospatiale company the operations manager and three other ati 
officials reponsible for flight operations manuals and pilots an 
official who certified the flightworthiness of the atr42 and 
three officials of the civil aviation office responsible for flight 
manuals and authorizing flight routes

officer accused of shooting and seriously wounding a 16yearold 
during a nov 27 protest by 1500 ethnic croatians

australians could be considered to have breached international 
diplomatic conventions or yugoslav laws

australian governments closure of the consulategeneral in 
sydney he said in an interview 
security guard zoran matijas wearing dark glasses and carrying 
his 3yearold daughter said at the airport i have not been 
authorized to say anything 
the youth was shot in the throat when demonstrators scaled the 
consulate walls and tried to tear down the yugoslav flag 
consul glisic defended matijas action saying the guard fired 
two warning shots during the demonstration 
zoran was defending me in what was a destructive attack on our 
consulate glisic said the circumstances of the wounding are 
unclear it has not been proven that matijas did it 
foreign minister budimir loncar praised matijas he was 
defending our territory he was not attacking therefore we refused 
to hand him over he told belgrade television sunday 
loncar said his government will demand satisfaction for an 
alleged australian breach of the vienna consular convention under 
which consular officials enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution 
for acts performed in exercise of consular functions

against yugoslav resistance forces during world war ii croatian 
extremists have been charged with killing at least two yugoslav 
diplomats and wounding others in various attacks in the past 20 
years

pioneer 12 was designed to orbit 
venus for just 243 days but it chalked up a solid decade of work 
monday amid raves from the scientists whove kept the project 
working 
the space probe has helped map 93 percent of venus searinghot 
surface while providing a new understanding of volcanics and land 
formation on earth 
it has sent scientists 10 trillion bits of data including 
information on the extreme greenhouse effect which appears to be 
trapping the suns heat and driving the planets surface temperature 
to 900 degrees fahrenheit 
it also has allowed them to speculate on the ways in which venus 
once thought to be the earths twin because of its similar size 
composition and the presence of continents mountains and canyons 
is different from our home planet 
we used to think when i was in school that venus and earth were 
twin planets said donald hunten a professor of planetary 
sciences at the university of arizonas lunar and planetary 
laboratory said at a meeting of scientists celebrating pioneers 
longevity more recently weve discovered they are really not 
very alike at all 
scientists at the meeting took the opportunity to call for a 
return to unmanned space probes in addition to the far more costly 
manned missions 
steven dorfman who works for hughes aircraft co a major 
government space contractor called for a return to a mix of small 
and large programs pointing out that the pioneer project was 
relatively cheap at less than 200 million in todays dollars 
dorfman said the united states launched 36 planetary launches in 
the 1960s but only 11 in the 1970s two are scheduled in this 
decade 
although venus has no oceans hunten said data suggests there may 
have been enough water vapor to form an ocean 4 billion years ago 
but high temperatures from the planets severe greenhouse 
effect in which clouds or pollution traps the suns heat near the 
planets surface may partially account for the differences between 
venus and earth he said 
additionally extreme stratospheric pollution on venus where 
chlorine is found at levels 100 to 1000 times the concentration 
found in the air above earth could further explain conditions on 
venus and provide a warning of our own future 
venus is not a living breathing example but a very dead 
example of what a polluted atmosphere is like said hunten adding 
that the pollution on venus is natural but the chemistry is the same 
as on earth 
lawrence colin pioneer venus project scientist said the

american and soviet religious leaders said 
monday the glasnost policy of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will 
give churches in the soviet union more political clout 
meeting on the eve of gorbachevs visit to the united states in 
which he will address the united nations and meet with president 
reagan and presidentelect george bush delegates to the 
usussr emerging leaders summit were optimistic soviet clergy 
even may be be allowed to run for legislative offices 
the message is coming through loud and clear that gorbachevs 
initiatives are spilling over and touching upon religious life 
said rabbi gary zola of cincinnati dean of admissions at hebrew 
union college there is new interest in religious thought and 
religious life and the government is not only permitting it but also 
is fostering it 
religion and politics are among the topics being addressed at the 
weeklong summit ending wednesday the summit is sponsored by the 
columbus indbased american center for international leadership 
and the soviet unions committee of youth organizations 
soviet delegates were optimistic gorbachevs visit with us 
officials would be productive 
i hope gorbachev and president reagan will advance negotiations 
on nuclear disarmament and lead the way for more success with george 
bush said andrei rybin 32 a priest in moscows russian orthodox 
church 
nikolai mukhin a member of the ussr council of religious 
affairs said im sure there will be some initiatives reached for 
a continuing dialogue with bush next year 
on the issue of religious freedom in their own country the 
soviet delegates said gorbachevs policy of openness is letting 
church leaders speak out without fear of reprisal for the first time 
in more than 50 years 
we will have a constructive role in the secular society 
especially in terms of culture and selfdetermination rybin said 
religion will be more open the communist party remains atheistic 
in principle but it now recognizes the role of the church and that 
it had been neglecting it 
mukhin who admitted hes not a believer said that under the 
new laws religious leaders will be able to be elected to 
legislative bodies the whole situation is developing in the 
direction of lenins idea that people are entitled to have freedom 
of conscience 
rabbi david wortman executive director of the jewish community 
relations council of greater philadelphia said he found a 
significant change in the soviet position on the issue of allowing 
jews to emigrate 
what was different is that they clearly supported the position 
that every person should have the right to emigrate and this gives 
rise to cautious optimism wortman said 
rybin said on the problem of jewish emigration there were many 
opinions but we all recognize that every human being has the right 
to go and live wherever he wants and that is the declaration of 
human rights we support not only for jews but for everybody

paul kirk announced plans monday to step aside 
as democratic national chairman when his term expires setting up a 
freeforall when the party picks a new leader early next year 
kirk who had been beseeched by many topranking democrats to 
seek a new term told a news conference that when he took the job in 
1985 the time i set for myself was four years 
my plans are as they were at the beginning which is to return 
to the practice of law said the 50yearold native of boston he 
quickly added he does not intend to become a political dropout 
several candidates for chairman already were jockeying for 
position in the event of kirks decision to step aside ronald h 
brown a longtime party activist who played a key role in jesse 
jacksons campaign is expected to announce his plans to seek the 
post at a news conference tuesday morning 
michigan party chairman richard wiener also said he would run for 
the post and said i feel confident i can win 
former rep jim jones of oklahoma also said he expected to make 
an announcement next monday jones who practices law in washington 
said he had contacted some party officials last month and received 
encouragement to run for the job if kirk stepped down 
former rep mike barnes of maryland said im running former 
rep jim stanton of ohio also has expressed an interest in the post 
the democratic national committee meets feb 910 in washington 
to pick a new chairman 
kirk won praise for his work even as the competition to succeed 
him began 
he leaves the chairmanship with our party rejuvenated and 
prepared for the future said massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
the partys losing presidential candidate this year 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen said kirks tenure was 
excellent and added his departure makes it much more difficult to 
arrive at a choice without some bloodshed 
kirk said in departing that his purpose had been to give 
something back and to leave something better than existed before i 
was given the honor and the opportunity to serve 
he said repeatedly at his news conference that the party was 
better off financially and politically than it was four years ago 
he said his biggest disappointment was the loss of the presidential 
race last month 
during these four years i have spoken of the value of politics 
and i have worked to practice the politics of values and to enhance 
respect for our political parties and for public life and our public 
institutions 
kirk said at the news conference he expected a spirited 
contest in the campaigning to pick his successor but disputed a 
suggestion that democrats are in for a bloodletting 
brown alone among the potential successors had not ruled out 
challenging kirk for the job he is viewed with suspicion by some 
party leaders because of his close association with jackson a black 
liberal who is expected to run for the democratic presidential 
nomination in 1992 
kirk is a native of massachusetts who earned his political 
stripes as a lieutenant to liberal sen edward m kennedy of 
massachusetts 
he was viewed with suspicion by many in the party when he waged 
his winning campaign for the chairmanship but by the time the 
democratic state chairs met in arizona last month an effort to 
draft him for a second term was well under way kirk said defeated 
presidential candidate dukakis bentsen the partys congressional 
leadership and numerous governors had all urged him to remain in the 
job 
kirk said little about his own plans but confirmed widespread 
reports he had held a discussion with the owner of the san diego 
padres joan kroc about taking a job with the baseball team he 
said he doubted anything would come of it

dan quayle education secretary lauro f cavazos new hampshire gov 
john sununu the future white house chief of staff and transition 
codirector robert teeter 
bush did not join the presidents in speaking to reporters after

the federal role in ensuring access to higher education a need to 
support scientific research on campuses and a shortage of 
scientists and engineers especially among members of minority 
groups

the group which included lamar alexander university of tennessee 
william cunningham university of texas at austin william danforth 
chancellor washington university james duderstadt university of 
michigan david gardner university of california paul gray 
massachusetts institute of technology frank rhodes cornell 
university ronald roskens university of nebraska william friday 
former president of the university of north carolina also attended 
schmidt said bush stressed the limits on federal resources and 
the need to make hard choices about the federal budget to bring the 
deficit under control he said the presidents understood that and 
agreed to help bush by setting carefully the educational 
priorities and the science research priorities in the country 
we discussed the essential importance of maintaining the 
openness and accessibility of higher education so that all our young 
people can aspire to the best that our education system offers

we expressed our great concern at the shortage of welleducated 
people in science and engineering in this country said schmidt

upgrade the position of science adviser to the president and 
appoint a presidential advisory council on science and technology 
alexander former governor of tennessee said federal research 
and development has grown by 50 percent after inflation during the 
reagan administration but much of that spurt has been in military 
rampd

funds already existing for rampd and thats a tough decision that 
needs to be done with expert help 
alexander a bush education adviser during the campaign said 
we didnt try to lecture the vice president we tried to say 
were here to help 
gardner said the campus presidents also mentioned west german 
chancellor helmut kohls interest in expanding international 
education and scholarly exchanges with the united states gardner 
said bush was very understanding of it he had already talked with 
chancellor kohl and has an intense interest 
schmidt asked if he were troubled by bushs campaign digs at 
democratic rival michael dukakis and dukakis havard yard 
advisers said i did not take that too seriously 
but he added any concerns expressed about harvard in that 
regard would also be entirely appropriate with respect to yale we 
both stand for excellence and were both very proud of what we stand

been suffocated 
he declined to speculate on a motive or to label the deaths mercy 
killings i cannot share evidence that will be detrimental to the 
case he said 
he said detectives have investigated but been unable to confirm 
allegations that the suspects may have begun choosing their victims 
based on initials of the victims names which they hoped to use to 
spell the word murder 
the first name of one of the people whose deaths were cited in 
the charges monday began with an m the other with an e 
authorities have declined to give the names of the other six people 
whose deaths are under investigation its a complex motive 
sprenger said its a complex case its so complex its going to 
take a lengthy trial to make a lot of sense 
reporters were turned away from the nursing home monday by a 
private security guard 
alpine manor is devastated but relieved that something is 
being done ginny seyferth spokeswoman for alpine manor said at 
a news conference both women had very good reviews both were 
wellliked by the patients 
i think the staff is overwhelmed she said adding that 
counseling was being provided for employees

deaths there was nothing they could have done to prevent it he 
said 
ms wood was arrested early monday and was ordered held without 
bond in the kent county jail here pending another hearing dec 16 
ms graham was arrested sunday night by authorities in tyler texas 
she was ordered held on 1 million bond and michigan authorities 
said they would seek extradition 
in both cases the murder charges brought against the women were 
open meaning the degree of murder was not immediately specified

the nations first mobile methadone van is being 
geared up to serve the workingclass community of brockton and 
possibly others in an effort to assuage neighborhood worries without 
giving up the fight against heroin 
the van was the brainchild of massachusetts officials seeking a 
way around neighborhood objections to the opening of a permanent 
clinic for heroin addicts 
its part of a statewide drug treatment strategy said john 
stobierski of the state department of public health which is 
overseeing the project 
methadone a synthetic substitute for heroin is given to addicts 
to reduce their craving for the drug 
the van a version of which has been tried successfully in 
europe would operate out of the police station parking lot in 
brockton a city 20 miles south of boston operators of the van made 
a dry run monday without providing methadone services 
it provides us with the flexibility to bring the service into 
communities stobierski said there was some concern in brockton 
over the siting of a methadone service we broached the idea of 
using the van 
brockton mayor carl pitaro has not given final approval for the 
van to operate permanently out of brockton said mayoral aide john 
buckley the city is seeking an agreement with the state that would 
limit the amount of time the van spent in brockton and would 
restrict the vans clients to brockton residents 
dennis mccarty of the health departments division of substance 
abuse said the van was designed to address brocktons concerns about 
addicts flocking to their city 
one concern is that programs in buildings tend to draw people 
from a wide geographic area mccarty said by having a mobile 
program we have a chance to reach out to other communities without 
burdening any one community too much 
mccarty said similar van programs are being considered for other 
parts of the state 
the brockton methadone program stems from a public health 
department effort aimed as much at stopping the spread of aids as at 
combating heroin addiction the virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrom can be spread through the sharing of hypodermic 
needles 
the state estimates there are 600 to 800 needleusing addicts in 
brockton but opponents of the methadone program say those numbers 
are inflated fifty to 70 heroin addicts are expected to receive 
methadone treatment at the van during the initial stage of its 
operation 
according to david mulligan public health director of substance 
abuse some 300 addicts are already in treatment in brockton 20 
percent of whom use methadone 
stobierski said state officials confirmed the van was the first 
in the nation because it required approval from federal health 
officials and the approval was the first of its kind

ultimate in security for soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
threeday visit this week to new york city and forecasting one of 
the worst traffic nightmares in years gorbylock

any visit we have had in years and years said gillian martin 
sorensen the citys liaison to the united nations 
on wednesday gorbachev is scheduled to address the general 
assembly and have lunch with president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush as well as other us and soviet officials 
were talking about one of the superpowers and a visit by a 
very important world leader ms sorensen said it will be 
ultimate security the new york city police department and the 
secret service will do all they can do 
when asked how the security was going to affect the citys 
motorists joe obrien a spokesman for the citys transportation 
department summed it up in one word gorbylock 
gorbachev and his wife raisa are expected to stay at the soviet 
mission to the united nations at 136 east 67th st a short drive 
from the un complex 
gorbachevs itinerary released by the police department on 
monday includes a visit to the observation deck atop one of the 
world trade center towers after the soviet leaders luncheon meeting 
wednesday 
gorbachevs 45car motorcade is then to ride past the new york 
stock exchange and head up to times square all in the heart of 
rush hour on avenues closed for the convenience of the visitors and 
to the torment of local drivers 
on thursday gorbachev is to attend a soviet trade show at the 
jacob javits convention center then head across town for a visit to 
central park and a look at the metropolitan museum of arts european 
paintings 
police also said mrs gorbachev might visit a department store 
but they did not say which one or when speculation had centered on 
macys and bloomingdales although a soviet official noted that a 
trip to the former was problematic because of crowds attracted by 
its prechristmas sales 
on friday morning the gorbachevs would go directly to kennedy 
airport for a flight to cuba police said 
during his last visit to the united states the soviet leader 
made an unexpected stop in downtown washington to greet the 
lunchtime crowd and chief robert johnston jr indicated the new 
york police are prepared for such an occurrence 
we have contingency plans he said 
security is expected to be tight because of the past history of 
antisoviet incidents here some linked to members of the militant 
jewish defense league 
a tear gas bomb forced the opening night audience for the 
moiseyev dance company to flee from the metropolitan opera on sept 
2 1986 there was a bomb scare when the bolshoi ballet opened at 
lincoln center in july 1987 a car at the soviet residential complex 
in the bronx was firebombed in 1984 
five protest groups have obtained permits to demonstrate outside 
the united nations during gorbachevs appearance before the general 
assembly including the coalition for soviet jewry the students for 
soviet jewry and organizations representing afghans ukrainians and 
armenians 
police spokesman sgt peter sweeney said this is going to be a 
major major operation by the new york city police department in 
both manpower and traffic problems 
police chief robert johnston jr said 6600 officers will be 
assigned to work overtime on the visit at a cost of more than 1 
million we are going to document every cops assignment and apply 
for reimbursement to the state department he said 
the police will coordinate the security effort with the secret 
service the state department and the united nations 250member 
police force 
when asked to characterize the force that will be in place 
anthony oconnell the united nations security chief said the 
standards of security that are normal at this headquarters for the 
visits of heads of state 
when about 90 heads of government attended the united nations 
40th anniversary hundreds of city police as well as teams of 
police scuba divers helicopter patrols and mounted officers watched 
the events conscious of possible terrorist attacks 
the police harbor unit stationed patrol boats off the un 
complex on the east river around the clock teams of police divers 
performed daily searches of the riverfront piers for bombs 
in 1981 when prince charles of britain paid a oneday visit to 
new york city and lunched with president and mrs reagan he was 
guarded by a 2000member security force which included 1725 city 
police officers 
the biggest and most costly security and crowd and traffic 
control operation was the october 1979 visit of pope john paul ii 
the twoday papal visit involved more than 13000 city police 
officers and cost more than 3 million

three news organizations filed suit monday to 
force the bipartisan national economic commission to meet in public 
when it discusses economic forecasts and ways to cut the federal 
budget 
the lawsuit filed in federal court seeks an injunction to bar the 
commission from closing its scheduled dec 12 meeting to the public 
the suit contends that a secret proceeding would violate a federal 
openmeeting law 
the commission scheduled the closed session to discuss which 
economic forecast to adopt as a basis for making future 
recommendations and to review various budgetcutting options 
if the commission is permitted to deny the public access to its 
discussion of economic assumptions and its review of budget options 
the public will be deprived of an essential tool of democracy 
said the lawsuit by the washington post the wall street journal and 
the bureau of national affairs which publishes financial 
newsletters 
the lawsuit was also joined by consumer advocate ralph naders 
public citizen and stephen wildstrom an editor for business week 
it seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent the commission 
from holding the dec 12 meeting in private and a declaration that 
closed sessions violate the federal advisory committee act 
us district judge joyce hens green scheduled a hearing for 10 
am wednesday 
the commission held three socalled briefing sessions last summer 
without a quorum of the 12member panel present in order to avoid 
the openmeeting requirements officials discontinued that practice 
after objections were raised 
but alexander platt the commissions general counsel said the 
panel intended to go ahead with the closed session on dec 12 he 
said it was covered under a section of law that allows such 
discussions to be private if premature disclosure of the 
deliberations would frustrate an agencys actions 
we believe we understand the proper application of the federal 
advisory committee act and we have followed every appropriate 
procedure in closing the meeting we intend to hold the closed 
session on dec 12 he said 
jim hildreth spokesman for the commission said that the 
advisory panel was also worried that financial markets could be 
affected by partial news reports on the deliberations 
platt cited this concern to the plaintiffs in a letter that 
referred to a sharp drop in the financial markets following the nov 
16 appearance of federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan the 
complaint said 
greenspans recommendation that the president take urgent steps 
to reduce the federal deficit was cited by some observers as a cause 
of the drop in the stock market 
the complaint said the news organizations are particularly 
interested in the commissions discussion of economic assumptions 
becuse it will greatly influence if not determine what the 
commission forecasts for the national economy 
the commission has also scheduled an open meeting on wednesday to 
hear witnesses from the congressional budget office discuss the 
economic assumptions they will provide congress

told a capitol hill news conference that government support for such 
services is insufficient and he complained that fire safety becomes 
an issue only after major incidents occur

loaded with 30000 pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded ripping a 
large crater in the ground and virtually obliterating a fire truck 
investigators determined arson to be the probable cause

circumstances surrounding that incident and that the administrator 
of the us fire administration part of the federal emergency 
management agency had agreed to conduct the probe 
alfred k whitehead president of the international association 
of fire fighters requested a congressional inquiry into the matter 
as well saying i am hopeful the congress will address the 
question of fire department notifications hazardous materials 
training for emergency response teams and the quantities of 
hazardous materials appropriate for community safety 
what took place in kansas city can take place in nearly every 
community in america whitehead said 
jim estepp a spokesman for the international association of fire 
chiefs said his organization joined with weldon and other fire 
associations in asking that the deaths of these fire fighters not 
be in vain and that the new administration and congress will keep 
the needs of the nations fire and emergency service as a major 
priority to maintain the safety of the public and of fire fighters 
the congressional fire services caucus is one of the largest on 
capitol hill and has 277 members from the house of representatives

executive committee left the impression in april 1985 it would 
allocate 80000 per week to increased repayment of outstanding 
loans but hintz said the actual funds received for that purpose 
never exceeded about 38000 weekly 
meanwhile hintz said the total debt was growing because of new 
borrowing he said the debt rose from about 10 million in late 1984 
to 40 million by late 1985 with 45 million in total interest 
owed 
bardwell former editor of fusion magazine a larouche 
publication said larouche outlined his fundraising philosophy 
before enthusiastic followers in a speech in the bronx ny in 
january 1984 
bardwell said larouche demanded tremendous amounts of money 
to finance his speaking tours and television appearances and to 
provide protection against assassination attempts he justified 
any means short of thievery and thuggery to raise this money 
bardwell said 
he said the human race was on the verge of selfdestruction 
said bardwell who was associated with larouche for nearly 12 years 
he said they lacked the moral fiber to survive 
larouche said the human race would be destroyed by nuclear war if 
sufficient money were not raised to finance his operations bardwell 
said he compared the human race to lemmings rushing to their own 
destruction 
in every speech bardwell said larouche said the main reason 
some of his followers were failing to meet their fundraising quotas 
was sexual impotence or sexual problems and he frequently 
referred to them as swine 
bardwell said larouche berated organizers who hadnt raised 
enough money for contributing to the likelihood that he and his 
wife would be assassinated 
bardwell of hastings on hudson ny who resigned from the 
larouche organization in february 1984 because of a dispute over 
defense policy and money questions said he complained frequently to 
larouche about diversion of money raised from subscriptions to 
bardwells magazine a publication of the larouchesponsored fusion 
energy foundation 
he said larouche responded that bardwells sense of obligation to 
his subscribers was misplaced and that whether or not they 
knew it they had contributed money to support lyndon larouche and 
his ideas 
larouche also said his personal security took precedence over all 
other demands on his organizations revenues 
larouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans with 
no intention of repaying them 
larouche is charged separately with conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid 
from funds of various corporations he controls prosecutors say 
larouche has not filed any federal income tax returns since 1978 
larouche has denied any wrongdoing and complained that he is the 
victim of government harassment if convicted on all 13 counts 
against him larouche faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison 
and fines totaling 325 million 
larouches codefendants who face lesser sentences if convicted 
of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges are william wertz his 
chief fundraiser chief legal adviser edward spannaus and 
fundraisers michael billington dennis small paul greenberg and 
joyce rubinstein 
bardwell testified that when he visited larouches los angeles 
office in 1983 he saw several rooms which larouche had called 
boiler rooms where telephone solicitors worked 10 hours to 12 
hours a day trying to meet team quotas of 600 to 700 daily 
the fundraising effort was very closely monitored by will 
wertz who posted periodic reports from the main office shopping 
centers and the los angeles airport on a bulletin board on his wall 
bardwell said larouche was highly pleased by the success of his los 
angeles fundraisers who were the best in the country 
in other testimony celia landegger of bronxville ny said she 
gave larouche solicitors 45000 in loans over a oneyear period 
ending in november 1985 but never had been repaid except for 
interest payments totaling 1300 
she said ms rubinstein at one point extended the payment 
deadline until january 1987 two years after the initial loan was 
supposed to be repaid but no payments were received

a special national institutes of health 
advisory committee formalized on monday its finding that it is 
acceptable for the federal government to back medical research 
involving the transplant of tissue from intentionally aborted fetal 
tissue 
the 16member panel spent a full day refining the wording of a 
lengthy report drafted in two earlier meetings however no 
substantive changes were made and the final report like earlier 
drafts carefully avoided taking a position on the morality of 
abortion itself or the morality of using tissue from such legally 
performed procedures 
there was no recorded vote on the key question of whether to 
recommend fetal tissue research but rather a series of separate 
votes taken on final wording of various subsections of the report 
however the tally at an oct 21 meeting had been 133 in favor 
of recommending that fetal tissue research proceed that specific 
question had been the focus of that meeting that sentiment was 
reflected in a minority report written by the same three dissenting 
members and made part of the final document under the heading 
additional comments 
the recommendation now goes to a standing nih advisory committee 
that is meeting dec 14 that committee in turn will make its 
recommendation to nih director james wyngaarden 
researchers hope that transplanting fetal brain cells into the 
brains of people with diabetes and parkinsons disease could provide 
an effective treatment perhaps in three to five years and that 
more study could lead to similar treatments for a number of other 
serious diseases for which no cure has been found 
the panels recommendation contains a number of guidelines to 
guard against women being encouraged even subtly to have an 
abortion in order to provide fetal tissue for research 
for example the committee said there should be no payment for 
the tissue beyond actual costs and that donations of fetal tissue 
to a family member or acquaintance should be banned lest women be 
tempted to become pregnant just so they could conceive a fetus for 
subsequent abortion and research use

guerrillla group 35 years ago and i think this is very good news 
for the country 
last month leyva proposed a ceasefire and negotiation plan 
under which president virgilio barco would name a panel to decide in 
30 days whether peace talks were possible if the commission 
recommended negotiations they would begin within 50 days 
barcos government did not respond immediately to leyvas latest 
announcement both m19 and farc accepted the original leyva 
proposal two weeks ago but a presidential spokesman said no talks 
could be held until the rebels stopped their attacks 
cesar gaviria the spokesman called the senators proposal a 
step toward peace several attempts at ceasefires and negotiations

a criminal court monday sentenced the 
sisterinlaw of pakistan premier benazir bhutto to two years in 
prison after convicting her in connection with her husbands death 
rehana bhutto is living in the united states and did not appear 
at her own trial to face charges of nonassistance to a person in 
danger 
the charges stem from the poisoning death of her husband shah 
nawaz bhutto in july 1985 at the couples apartment in cannes on 
the riviera 
at the time nearly the whole bhutto family were living in exile 
on the french mediterranean coast including the widow of former 
prime minister ali bhutto who was overthrown and hanged in 1977 his 
two sons shah nawaz and murtaza and their wives 
shah narwaz who was a leader of the pakistani opposition 
apparently died of poison from a vial he carried for use if he was 
caught by his enemies testimony revealed 
rehana bhutto discovered his body in the room next to hers only 
hours after the poisoning in her initial interrogation she told 
investigators she heard her husband moaning in his room but paid no 
attention because she was angry with him 
she was jailed for nearly two months while police investigated 
the case and then because the charges were minor she was released 
so she could be with her child in the united states

the federal aviation administration has 
completed action on six of 102 measures it proposed to improve 
controltower operations at chicagos ohare international airport 
aides to sen paul simon said monday 
simons office released a report from the faa outlining progress 
on its plans to reduce flighthandling errors by air traffic 
controllers at ohare 
controllers at the nations busiest airport committed 30 such 
errors in the first 10 months of 1988 surpassing the previous 
record of 22 mistakes in 1986 and 12 in 1987 
responding to a senate resolution demanding a timetable for 
improvements the agency submitted a detailed action plan to simon 
dill in october and promised him monthly status reports 
press secretary david carle said the most noteworthy measures 
outlined in the first update were adding five experienced 
controllers to the ohare tower replacing aircraft situation 
display equipment there and at a regional traffic center in aurora 
ill and acquiring additional display equipment which will be 
installed later 
although the faa listed six recommendations as closed 
including the addition of the situation display equipment and 
budgeting money for overtime pay the designation does not mean a 
proposal was adopted 
for example the agency said a proposal to modify a telephone 
system to allow conference calls among various personnel handling a 
flight was closed because the system changes were not practical 
a proposal to add consoles for training was closed because it 
said faa personnel in chicago advised the agency no additional 
consoles were needed 
other steps listed as closed were reviewing swap control 
procedures with the industry and speeding the installation of a 
communications switching system 
there are no major problems with the existing switching 
system and atampt assured the faa that they can maintain the existing 
system at ohare for at least the next five years the report said

the general assembly on monday adopted a 
package of resolutions deploring south africas apartheid system 
and noted that japan is the leading trading partner of the minority 
whiteruled nation 
one resolution singled out israel and certain western states 
for criticism because of their continued military nuclear 
intelligence and technological trade and collaboration with south 
africa 
the general assembly passes similar antiapartheid resolutions 
every year 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
the resolution condemning military collaboration with south 
africa passed 1232 with 29 abstentions israel which was 
criticized by name and the united states voted against it most 
western nations including australia and new zealand and japan 
abstained 
us delegate harvey nelson said the united states opposed the 
resolution because it explicitly criticized israel for actions 
which many have committed including some of those who protest most 
loudly 
another resolution calling on israel to end its collaboration 
with south africa particularly its longterm contracts for military 
supplies passed 10623 with 26 abstentions 
numerous western nations opposed that resolution because it 
singled out one nation for what they called unproductive criticism 
canada the united states and the 12 european community nations 
took that view 
the resolution calling for comprehensive and mandatory economic 
sanctions against south africa passed 12312 with 19 abstentions 
japan was mentioned in the text as south africas largest trade 
partner 
japanese ambassador hideo kagami contended the resolution gave 
the false impression that japan has been increasing its trade with 
south africa 
he said japanese trade as measured in yen had declined every year 
since 1984 a rise in trade as measured in dollars merely reflected 
the fall of the dollar against the yen he said 
that resolution called for the security council to make economic 
sanctions mandantory and appealed to britain and the united states 
not to continue using their veto power to block enforced sanctions 
the 12 opposition votes were from western europe canada japan 
and israel 
a resolution expressing international solidarity with the 
liberation struggle against south africa passed 1313 with 21 
abstentions by most of the western allies the united states 
britain and portugal voted against the measure 
the resolution called for full support for the african national 
congress the black guerrilla group fighting the south african 
government and affirmed the right to used armed struggle in pursuit 
of liberation 
portugals secondranking diplomat jose caetano da costa 
pereira said his country opposed apartheid but could not support 
the endorsement of armed struggle 
a resolution calling for voluntary international coordination and 
monitoring of boycotts against south africa passed 1364 with 14 
abstentions by western nations japan and malawi 
west germany portugal britain and the united states opposed the 
resolution which calls for nations to adopt voluntary sanctions 
against south africa preventing trade in nuclear materials and 
technology oil and petroleum credit and loans air transport and 
links culture and sports and military goods and services 
the current voluntary oil embargo against south africa would be 
made mandatory by the security council under a resolution that 
passed 1382 with 14 abstentions by western europe canada japan 
botswana lesotho and swaziland 
britain and the united states voted no and have vetoed 
attempts in previous years to make the embargo mandatory by using 
their veto in the security council

richard m daley bearer of the most recognizable 
name in bigcity politics and seasoned by an unsuccessful run five 
years ago announced monday he will seek the mayors office his 
father occupied for 21 years 
daleys entry into the race expands the democratic field to 
seven with an eighth mayor eugene sawyer expected to announce 
within a week that he also is a candidate 
according to a recent poll the 46yearold daley who last month 
overwhelmingly won a third term as cook county states attorney 
jumps into the race as the clear frontrunner 
daley said he is not concerned by a crowded field 
i dont need anyone in or out if i stood here worrying bout 
this scenario or that or about odds i would not be running as a 
candidate for mayor of chicago 
im running he told a packed news conference and im 
going to win 
daley becomes the fourth white candidate in a city that made the 
late harold washington its first black mayor in 1983 and has split 
its vote along racial lines since 
im not interested in running as the white candidate or 
serving as mayor for half the people daley said 
fighting crime is not a white issue or a black issue schools 
is not a white or black issue protecting taxpayers is not a white 
or black issue he said 
the democratic primary which has been the stepping stone to the 
fifth floor office at city hall for every chicago mayor since 1931 
is scheduled for feb 28 
the special election set last month by the illinois supreme 
court to complete washingtons second term follows on april 4 
richard j daley who controlled a political army through 
patronage jobs and earned the moniker boss for his ironfisted 
grip on both local and national politics served as chicagos mayor 
from 1955 until his death in 1976 
the younger daley who served as a state legislator during part 
of that time before moving to the prosecutors post made a first 
attempt to fill his fathers shoes in 1983 
daley split the white vote in that democratic primary with 
thenmayor jane byrne coming in third and catapulting washington 
into the mayors chair 
but in an almost complete reversal of events washingtons death 
last november has fractured the black voting bloc that was so 
unified behind the former congressman 
the city council in a tumultuous session after washingtons 
death appointed sawyer as acting mayor to serve until the next 
election neither sawyer nor alderman tim evans the other leading 
black candidate appears able to muster the monolithic support that 
made washington the first mayor since the elder daley to win 
reelection 
the mayors office is not an heirloom to be passed on from one 
generation to the next sawyer said monday richard m daleys 
announcement in no way changes my plans i expect to win handily 
against any opposition 
a gallup poll in october the most recent survey pitting 
announced and expected democrats against one another found daley 
winning with 37 percent to 22 percent for evans and 10 percent for 
sawyer 
the other democratic candidates are aldermen edward burke 
lawrence bloom and danny davis former chicago park district 
superintendent edmund kelly and former state sen james taylor 
city gop leaders were still looking for a candidate to back 
though at least one republican edward howlett announced on his own

estonian activists indicated monday they 
will postpone confrontation with moscow over running their own 
affairs in hopes time and negotiation will work in the baltic 
republics favor 
the finger was waved but the door was not slammed when the 
kremlin nullified estonias declaration of sovereignty last month 
said tonis avikson spokesman for the broadbased peoples front 
activists in estonia said they have great hope for a new national 
commission that is to define the powers of moscow and the republics 
monday was opening day of a session of the legislature to 
consider economic reforms and making the estonian language official 
after the legislature declared nov 16 that it had a right to 
veto national laws there were calls to cancel a federal statute 
setting rules for demonstration permits but estonian deputies in 
tallinn the estonian capital said monday they were in no hurry to 
veto anything 
at present we are striving for our presidium to fix the 
procedure for ratifying soviet laws or arranging a vote of the 
legislature on them said edgar savisaar a leader of the peoples 
front and a recently elected member of the legislature 
another deputy arno almaniv said a more liberal local law 
automatically supersedes the national statute under estonias 
proclamation of sovereignty 
members indicated they would compromise on demands for the 
closure of tallinns most serious polluter a paper mill under a 
moscow ministrys control and were leaning toward a phased closing 
over two years 
a new mill built jointly with a finnish company should be ready 
in two years and is expected to replace the jobs and production lost 
by closing the old one it will use the latest lowpollution 
technology and concentrate on making toilet paper a chronically 
scarce commodity in the soviet union 
conciliatory tactics including repeated statements that 
sovereignty does not mean independence are critical to preventing a 
repeat of the czechoslovak experience 20 years ago when a 
sovietled invasion force crushed the liberal prague spring 
said marju lauristin a peoples front leader 
responding to a reporters question she said such an event would 
set estonia back decades and endanger the reforms of president 
mikhail s gorbachev that made the estonian action possible 
we cannot imagine perestroika going forward with tanks in 
estonia she said 
estonia is pressing ahead with some elements of its autonomy 
campaign and has formally proposed opening a consulatetype office 
in sweden said valle feldman spokesman for the estonian foreign 
ministry 
the republic also is pursuing plans for economic sovereignty 
even though the kremlin rejected estonian ownership of all factories 
and natural resources on its territory 
rein otsason head of the estonian planning agency said the 
government is pursuing de facto economic control even if legal 
ownership remains with national authorities

it was a scene from a peace activists dream 
a soviet military analyst held a report given him monday by a us 
army major and offered to send related material about the soviet 
army to his american counterpart 
thats great because the more we can read the better and we 
fear less said maj robert butto who had just given alexander 
savelyev an american compilation of soviet military terms 
savelyev a nuclear disarmament researcher at the institute of 
world economy and international relations in moscow said he later 
gave butto a copy of his own analysis of soviet strategic 
communications 
the two met as part of the usussr emerging leaders summit 
a weeklong gathering of young soviet and american leaders in 16 
different fields 
other topics being discussed mostly in closeddoor sessions 
include government and political affairs international trade the 
arts education global environment social services and medicine 
savelyev said the military meetings were important because the 
delegates had come to better understand even purely on a personal 
level that we are the same people as you that we dont want to go 
to war just as you dont 
us delegates said the meeting was unique because lowlevel us 
and soviet officers were seeking common ground in a manner that has 
not occurred since world war ii when the soviet union and the 
united states joined to fight nazi germany 
after history has taken its course the common purpose now 40 
years later is to come back and perhaps see if we can find some new 
common ground within the context of the way the world is today 
said scott salmon a defense department analyst 
its extraordinary that youre in the room with soviet officers 
conversing on a daytoday basis said butto a pentagon analyst 
of soviet armed forces 
the material butto exchanged with savelyev is publicly available 
but just the fact of an ongoing dialogue with the soviet armed 
forces is an eyeopener butto said 
the delegates agreed to set aside divisive issues such as 
military strength in europe reductions in nuclear forces and 
regional conflicts those issues they said are more likely to be 
resolved in highlevel negotiations 
we are trying to find common concepts common approaches to the 
questions of mutual understanding said lt col anatoly f 
shatalov representing the chief political department of the soviet 
army and navy we are not counting tanks and cannons 
just the fact that we have come together to discuss area of 
concern to each of us is a step forward said us navy cmdr 
michael simpson 
one area that weve discussed is why we perceive threats from 
each others military forces the way theyre structured the 
strategy simpson said and weve discussed what changes might 
be made to make each other appear less threatening 
one threat discussed was the number of soviet tanks in eastern 
europe said simpson who added weve been able to express that 
concern and hear how the soviets responded to it but he declined 
to go into detail 
our goal is really just to honestly and openly share our 
perceptions and concerns with each other simpson said there 
will be great interest in what we discuss in the pentagon

a former counterterrorism adviser to the 
israeli government who died in a mexico plane crash while traveling 
under a phony name was a licensed arms dealer an israeli source 
said monday 
amiram nir reputedly had acted as a gobetween in the irancontra 
arms deal that shook the reagan administration 
the informed israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said nir was granted the arms license after he resigned from his 
government post earlier this year 
it was apparently a part of the resignation deal the 
source said 
the source said it was not known whether nir actually engaged in 
arms sales and quoted nir as telling friends he wanted to focus on 
development projects 
israeli officials and nirs friends and former colleagues denied 
that nir had a weapons selling license 
nir advised two israeli prime ministers on terrorism and was a 
key figure in the irancontra deal in mexico the 38yearold nir 
said he was an avocado exporter 
nir died in a plane crash wednesday while flying from uruapan 
about 200 miles west of mexico city 
in mexico city authorities arrested an argentine who had 
identified nirs body an argentine consulate source said monday 
pedro curchet was arrested for working in mexico while on a tourist 
visa and probably will be deported the source said on condition of 
anonymity 
avocado grower carlos garcia mendez said curchet had served as a 
quality control expert for the argentine partners in the avocado 
exporting firm eupasa which has a packing plant in uruapan garcia 
mendez is also a eupasa partner 
investigators cast doubt on the claim that nir was working as a 
fruit salesman because of his past and because he used an assumed 
name when renting the plane in which he crashed 
nir did not do much business on agricultural exports the 
israeli source said if this was the case why did he have to rent 
the plane under the name of pat weber 
israeli defense ministry spokesman eitan haber said he was 
unaware of an arms sales license granted to nir 
another israeli official who demanded anonymity denied nir had 
a license nir was a good friend of mine he said and i know 
he was involved in agricultural farms 
nirs former colleague ron benishai military commentator for 
the yediot ahronot daily wrote on sunday that nir was based in 
london and with several european and israeli businessmen imported 
fruits and vegetables to europe 
benishai quoted nir as telling him six months ago he had 
enough of arms sales during the irancontra affair 
on monday yediot quoted sources close to nirs family as 
denying the washington post report that quoted nir as saying that 
the counterterrorist operations he supervised in 1985 and 1986 with 
former white house aide oliver north were authorized by a secret 
usisraeli agreement 
nir was married to judy mosesnir the daughter of the first 
editor of yediot 
on sunday the daily maariv quoted north as saying nir was a 
real israeli hero he was an extraodinary courageous man and he was 
my friend 
the post report was denied by israel and the united states 
but an israeli expert on the irancontra affair said monday that 
there were at least two covert operations codenamed th1 and th2 
samuel segev author of a 340page study titled the iranian 
triangle said both operations involved organizing units of 
mercenaries to free us hostages held in lebanon 
his book says that under the th2 plan a secret 43man unit of 
lebanese druze was created in 1986 to help free american hostages 
the plan was dropped when nir told north there was only a 30 percent 
chance of success 
segev a columnist for the daily maariv newspaper told the 
associated press his information was based on classified israeli 
government papers and interviews with key israeli participants and 
iranian exiles

a us supreme court justice refused monday 
to block the murder trial of a christian scientist couple accused of 
killing their diabetic daughter by withholding medical care 
william and christine hermanson citing a state law that parents 
following their faith may not be convicted of child abuse simply by 
denying medical care sought to block their prosecution on grounds 
of religious freedom 
justice anthony m kennedy denied the emergency request without 
comment early monday the day the trial was due to begin 
after kennedy issued his ruling sarasota circuit judge alan 
dakan granted a defense motion to delay the trial until jan 23 to 
allow publicity about the case to die down 
the hermansons are charged with thirddegree murder and child 
abuse in the september 1986 death of their 7yearold daughter amy 
the couple denied her insulin injections because their religion 
teaches reliance on prayer instead of medical treatment 
amy had been ill for eight days and her diabetes worsened before 
an anonymous complaint alerted authorities a court ordered medical 
intervention but the girl was dead when paramedics arrived at the 
hermansons home 
when a request to keep the case from being tried was turned down 
by the florida supreme court the hermansons filed a similar motion 
before the nations high court 
the florida law which exempts parents from child abuse charges 
for denying medical care on religious grounds still allows the court 
to order medical intervention if the childs health is at risk 
prosecutors tried to have the law declared unconstitutional but 
a circuit judge upheld the state law allowing the hermansons to use 
the law as a defense 
assistant state attorney pat whitaker said earlier this year that 
while the law may provide some defense on the child abuse count it 
is irrelevant to the murder charge 
the emotional nature of the case was noted by dakan who ruled 
last month that certain statements in the court file may be sealed 
the case may involve serious and controversial questions of 
religious beliefs dakan said publication of such material 
could seriously hinder the defendants ability to obtain a fair 
and impartial trial

there werent many people at heritage usa 
on monday after a grand jury indicted ptl founder jim bakker but 
those who were there said the christian spirit is down but not out 
at the theme park 
john and frances lambert of renfrew ontario have been staying 
in the ptl trailer park for about three weeks 
lambert said he didnt know much about the charges against 
bakker or the alleged conspiracy involving the contributions of 
lifetime partners or major contributors 
none of one of the ones i talked to were upset about it because 
they said well we give to gods work and they didnt expect to 
get it back lambert said 
jim and tammy spent too much money i guess he said my 
whole thing is i hope they keep it heritage usa going as a 
christian place 
the indictment alleges that bakker and his top aide committed 
fraud by misleading partners on the benefits they would get from 
their contributions 
mrs lambert said there were fewer people on the grounds than 
when they visited last year but she didnt mind that 
because of it being slower you get more of a chance to get out 
and see things 
were really enjoying our stay and the friendliness of the 
whole area said lambert 
bakker resigned from the ministry in march 1987 after he admitted 
a sexual tryst with a former church secretary 
after the ministry filed for reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy law in june 1987 a trustee was appointed by the court to 
oversee heritage usa officials have said that visitors to the theme 
park have declined since the scandal broke and have laid off many 
park employees as they struggle to keep ptls finances afloat 
outside the heritage grand hotel on monday only the splash of a 
lighted fountain broke the stillness around the lobby of the hotel 
which has about onethird of its 490 rooms occupied were lamp posts 
spiraled with red ribbon like candy canes 
todd loren a bellman at the hotel said he was a devoted 
follower of bakker at one time 
i dont think that the indictments has an effect on 
anybody loren said it just means he gets his day in court 
thats the least he deserves 
as for the relative quiet of the scene monday he said its 
been quiet for 18 months now 
linda masters of charlotte nc said shed been visiting 
heritage for about four years and was saddened by its downfall 
the crowd isnt here at all ms masters said this place 
was filled with the holy spirit with god the holy spirit is still 
here but its terribly regretful what all has happened 
i loved jim and tammy bakker my heart really aches for them 
ms masters said they were given a vision here from god 
she said she still trusts the bakkers despite the allegations 
against them 
i think hes forgiven all men sin and hes just a man

soviet officials mapping the agenda for 
mikhail s gorbachevs trip to new york said monday that the soviet 
president wants to take as many bites as possible out of the big 
apple 
gorbachev arrives tuesday addresses the un general assembly 
and meets president reagan and presidentelect george bush on 
wednesday and goes sightseeing thursday he leaves friday for 
havana 
soviet officials were mum on the more touristoriented aspects of 
the agenda declining to say whether such visitor venues as macys 
or the statue of liberty were on the itinerary 
this will be a christmas surprise andrei grachev senior 
official in the ideology department of the communist party central 
committee told a news conference it is common to keep such 
preparations secret until the last moment 
his route is still being worked out but there is a natural 
desire to take as many bites as possible out of the big apple 
grachev said 
but new york police said the couple would visit the observation 
deck of the world trade center in lower manhattan on wednesday and 
drive past the stock exchange and through the broadway area opening 
a soviet export show viewing european paintings at the metropolitan 
museum of art and visiting central park were on the schedule 
thursday 
police said mrs gorbachev might visit a manhattan department 
store wednesday afternoon 
but soviet officials who last week said that trump tower 
considered new yorks epitome of capitalist ostentation was on the 
tentative schedule said monday that it was not on the itinerary 
dan klores a spokesman for real etate developer donald trump 
said the visit to trump tower was no longer on the program and that 
trump and his wife ivana instead would dine at the soviet mission 
thursday with other public figures 
soviet officials bombarded by questions about the propriety of a 
visit to to monuments to capitalism appear to have been somewhat 
embarrassed about the tentative itinerary for the worlds most 
powerful communist leader 
but at a news conference monday georgy arbatov director of the 
soviet institute on the united states and canada told reporters 
at macys or bloomingdales or any other store our 
understanding is that they ask for your cash or credit card and 
thats all 
no one asks about whether you belong to the communist party 
or about your moral behavior 
gorbachevs un visit will be the first by a soviet party leader 
since former leader nikita s khrushchev banged his shoe on a un 
desk in 1960 in the general assembly 
soviet premier alexei kosygin visited the united nations in 1967 
at the time he shared power with party leader leonid brezhnev 
vernon a walters us ambassador to the united nations said 
us authorities were aware of gorbachevs schedule but that the 
soviet side wanted to release it later 
grachev said gorbachevs un visit and meeting with reagan and 
bush will not disappoint the hopes and expectations for a better 
and safer world that americans and others outside this country have 
placed on him 
un observers said they expected gorbachevs speech to be a tour 
de force of soviet diplomacy that could contain major surprises and 
initiatives 
asked about the topics gorbachev would raise grachev said we 
are 100 percent sure he wont be silent on the middle east and a 
settlement there 
the visit comes at a time when the united states has offended the 
united nations arab nations and many un members by denying a visa 
to palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat to address 
the general assembly

relatives of the comatose wife of a once prominent 
exminster were awarded 16 million in damages from the husband 
monday after another woman testified that he and she had been 
longtime lovers 
psychologist lucy papillon confirmed reports that she and walker 
railey had been lovers for 10 months prior to the april 21 1987 
attack on peggy railey and that railey spent more than an hour at 
her home that night 
she insisted she knew nothing that could shed light on the 
identity of the assailant who choked mrs railey senseless and left 
her for dead in the garage of the couples fashionable home 
state district judge john whittington concluded the daylong 
civil trial by finding railey liable to mrs raileys family for 
nearly 16 million about evenly divided between actual and punitive 
damages 
though no criminal charges have been brought police have said 
that railey the former senior minister of the first united 
methodist church is the only suspect he denies attacking his wife 
bill arnold an attorney for mrs raileys mother billie jo 
nicolai was asked whether he thought the family would ever receive 
much money from railey who has said he has no money and no job 
i dont know how much money he has or how much money he will 
have in the future but im going to do my very best to see that 
whatever it is goes to peggy raileys medical expenses arnold 
said 
earlier monday a physician testified that mrs railey who is in 
a tyler nursing home and is given virtually no chance of regaining 
consciousness will require 43 million in medical treatment during 
the next 30 years 
dr williams parker director of the baylor institute of 
rehabilitation described mrs railey 40 as seriously 
braininjured and incapable of communication 
though he denies that he tried to kill his wife railey 
technically admitted the charges contained in the civil documents by 
refusing to respond to the lawsuit 
railey known for his liberal views on civil rights received 
death threats in the weeks before his wife was attacked police 
first thought they were from white supremacist groups but the fbi 
later traced them to a typewriter in the first united methodist 
church office 
whittington ruled last spring that railey intentionally 
knowingly maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife 
and cover up his actions with a false alibi 
he had told police he was involved in a research project at 
southern methodist university at the time of the attack on his wife 
railey 41 was not present monday and is believed living in san 
francisco but mrs papillon the other woman in the case 
testified as a reluctant witness 
unsmiling and composed ms papillon said she met railey several 
years ago but their affair did not begin until june 1986 she said 
that in the months before the attack she and railey would meet about 
three times a week mostly in her home 
the night of the attack she said he visited her for about 75 
minutes leaving about 845 pm she said he called her about 11 
pm saying he wanted to return to her house but they decided it 
was too late in the evening police believe that mrs railey was 
attacked sometime between 830 pm and 11 pm 
ms papillon described her relationship with railey as serious 
and longterm and said they had discussed marriage it was her first 
public comment on the relationship but she had testified about it 
earlier before a grand jury and in a sworn deposition 
an earlier witness projected mrs raileys lost wages as a music 
instructor at an exclusive dallas girls school as 11 million over 
the next 30 years 
witnesses have indicated railey did not seem terribly upset about 
the attack on his wife and later abandoned her and their two young 
children

nato will demand that warsaw pact 
nations make bigger reductions in their forces than the west when 
the sides meet for talks on conventional arms a us negotiator 
said monday 
its really quite a forwardlooking position paul nitze 
special assistant to president reagan on arms control issues said 
in a meeting with reporters 
it would carry out the principle of unequal reductions on 
the two sides in order to bring about an endpoint of equality he 
said this would require substantially greater reductions on 
the warsaw pact side 
the exact figures of the tanks armored personnel carriers 
bridging equipment and other forces still remain to be worked 
out nitze said 
secretary of state george p shultz and foreign ministers of the 
other north atlantic treaty organization countries are to confer 
thursday and friday in brussels about a joint position for 
negotiations on reducing conventional arms in europe 
in a speech later nitze declared there is opportunity for 
great progress in reducing the level of eastwest military 
confrontation across the board but complacency is unjustified much 
hard work lies ahead if this potential is to be realized 
on conventional arms he said it would be imprudent to assume 
that the huge imbalance between nato and warsaw pact conventional 
capabilities can be redressed solely through arms control 
negotiations 
one must also consider the fact that given the record of past 
efforts at conventional arms control any relief from arms control 
in this area is likely to come only several years in the future 
negotiations on conventional arms by the 16 nato and seven warsaw 
pact nations are expected to begin early next year in vienna 
austria under the name conventional stability talks 
nato issued a report last month saying the warsaw pact has a huge 
advantage in such weapons it cited 51500 main battle tanks for the 
warsaw pact and 16424 for nato along with 22400 armored infantry 
fighting vehicles for the east and 4153 for the west 
nitze said progress has been made toward reducing longrange or 
strategic nuclear weapons but many hurdles must yet be crossed 
before the finish line is reached and it is by no means a foregone 
conclusion that they will be

period was accompanied by his wife when he arrived in vienna 
czechoslovak authorities gave them 10day travel permits 
hajek asked by reporters in vienna whether czechoslovak 
authorities were changing their attitude toward dissenters said 
i would not like to project my simple adventure into a broader 
political context i dont want to make any speculation for the

a california scientist who vanished more than 18 
months ago raising federal officials fears because of his 
knowledge of the topsecret research laboratory where he worked was 
arrested here monday on federal charges 
an fbi agent who declined to give his name confirmed the arrest 
of chemist ronald k stump but refused to give further information 
stump who lived on a houseboat in the sacramento river delta 
had worked at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
livermore calif for more than 25 years before he disappeared in 
april 1987 
officials said he had access to the laboratorys topsecret 
tritium facility and other national clearances tritium is a 
radioactive form of hydrogen used in some forms of nuclear bombs 
stump told lawrence livermore officials he suspected that he had 
cancer and asked for extended sick leave however the government 
has charged stump with fraud over his alleged role in the 
laboratorys purchase of a 250000 piece of equipment that 
malfunctioned 
he was sought by the fbi on a warrant charging him with unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution 
allegations that federal authorities failed to investigate 
stumps disappearance and other employee violations at livermore and 
other laboratories have prompted an investigation by a the house 
energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations 
livermore administrators were worried about protecting the labs 
public image and chose to let stump go free rather than risk 
unfavorable publicity according to investigators on the labs 
security force and in congress

a un aviation agency on monday put off a 
decision on whether to condemn the united states for shooting down 
an iranian passenger jet 
the international civil aviation organizations governing council 
met to discuss a report from its technical staff which said the jet 
only had 40 seconds to respond to a warning before it was blown up 
by a us warship 
assad kotaite the organizations president said the group met 
for three hours but came to no conclusions 
he said the 33nation governing council would hold further talks 
wednesday but he said the group favors asking the organizations 
navigation commission to make a recommendation on the report at the 
governing councils next session in february 
the iran air airbus a300 was shot down over the persian gulf by 
the us warship vincennes on july 3 all 290 people on board were 
killed 
the report was made available friday to the canadian press news 
agency according to cp the report said us warships in the 
persian gulf had no way to hear radio transmissions between the iran 
air flight and air traffic controllers 
the iranian delegation to the governing councils meeting called 
for immediate condemnation of the united states the country does 
not have a vote on the council 
this tragic incident has one very big technical aspect 
spokesman mahmood hajighasemali said but he added the most 
important aspects are the humanitarian and legal aspects 
edmund stohr the us delegate declined comment 
the report concluded that several warnings were issued to the jet 
before the vincennes downed it but only one warning from another 
us vessel in the area was coded specifically for iran air flight 
655 
the plane only had about 40 seconds to react to that warning 
before it was shot down the report said it said the absence of a 
clear method of addressing challenged civil aircraft in us navy 
procedures probably contributed to the failure of the airliner crew 
to heed radioed warnings 
the pentagon had no comment monday its investigation found that 
a series of events aboard the vincennes led the ships crew to 
believe the airbus was an attacking iranian war plane 
a total of 159 nations belong to the international civil aviation 
organization headquartered in montreal

the leader of a military rebellion 
surrendered monday night turning over command of an arsenal he and 
about 500 followers used as a base during their uprising according 
to news reports 
the government of president raul alfonsin had claimed victory 
earlier monday saying the military rebellion was over but the 
public was skeptical because rebel leader col mohamed ali seineldin 
and many of the renegades remained at the villa martelli arsenal 
with the news that the last garrison now was in the hands of the 
authorities it appeared alfonsin had quelled the third army mutiny 
in 20 months and the most serious threat so far to his government 
a military officer at villa martelli told reporters that 
seineldin turned over command of the unit to gen isidro caceres 
according to the private news agency diarios y noticias 
the unidentified officer was quoted as saying that seineldin 
placed himself at the disposal of the appropriate military judge 
and that he would be transferred tuesday morning to a garrison to be 
imprisoned 
shortly after several army trucks left the arsenal carrying 
cheering troops according to the report it was not immediately 
known where the trucks were headed 
the news agency quoted the officer as saying seineldin assumed 
all responsibility for his actions during the fourday mutiny 
which began thursday 
political opponents had claimed alfonsin made a deal with the 
rebel soldiers and demanded that he reveal the terms 
an investigation began into a street battle between rebel 
soldiers and demonstrators sunday evening in which three people were 
killed and 13 civilians and 12 policemen were injured provincial 
police reported 
patricio echegaray general secretary of the communist party 
said monday the people in the streets smell treason in the 
governments claim to have squashed the rebels 
im sure that in the near future as a result of the backroom 
negotiations the government will try to impose an amnesty and bring 
an end to the trials of officers who participated in the state 
terrorism during the last dictatorship 
echegarays reference was to the military governments of 197683 
which conducted a socalled dirty war against leftists in which 
an estimated 9000 people disappeared 
alfonsin denies making a deal doubts stem from the fact that the 
government did not immediately arrest and disarm the rebels who 
said publicly they negotiated a truce rather than surrendered 
news reports said the mutineers handed over the infantry school 
at the campo de mayo base and the 6th mechanized infantry regiment 
at mercedes only after being told to do so by seineldin 
maj luis albert brun who led the mutineers at the infantry 
school said he expected the rebels to be allowed to return to their 
units without punishment 
the government has not said whether it will prosecute the rebels 
earlier monday seineldin helped dismantle barriers and retrieve 
land mines at the villa martelli arsenal the government news agency 
telam said he would be sent to a military prison in the interior 
rebel demands included an end to the prosecution of officers for 
human rights abuses in 197683 dictatorship a change in the 
military hierarchy and better pay and equipment the same demands 
were behind similar uprisings in april 1987 and last january 
it was clear this time that the rebels had wide support 
throughout the army 
five bases openly supported the mutineers and units at several 
others refused to help the government 
in contrast to the current situation soldiers who participated 
in the april 1987 uprising were arrested held incommunicado and 
taken to military prison 
alfonsin also said after that revolt that the surrender was 
unconditional soon afterward however threefourths of the armys 
top generals were removed and alfonsin proposed legislation limiting 
prosecution for human rights offenses only to the highestranking 
officers 
the street battle sunday occurred when loyal troops within 100 
yards of the rebel base at the villa martelli arsenal began pulling 
back 
several hundred people who had demonstrated against the rebellion 
surged forward hurling rocks and firebombs at rebel vehicles rebel 
soldiers opened fire 
police said two civilians and one policeman were killed they 
said earlier reports of a third civilian killed were wrong 
echegaray said the two civilians killed were members of the 
communist party he called them martyrs for democracy 
a bomb exploded monday morning at an army building in downtown 
buenos aires but caused no casualties a woman who telephoned the 
news agency noticias argentinas claimed responsibility for a group 
calling itself the che guevara brigade and said the explosion was 
homage to the dead at villa martelli

ptl founder jim bakker forced to quit his 
multimilliondollar television ministry after admitting a sexual 
encounter with a church secretary was indicted monday along with 
three former aides on charges of fraud and tax evasion 
a federal grand jury charged bakker 48 and former aide richard 
dortch 57 in a 24count indictment with mail fraud wire fraud and 
conspiring to defraud the public through the sale of lifetime 
partnerships in the ministrys heritage village theme park in fort 
mill sc south of charlotte 
if convicted they could face up to five years in prison and 
250000 fines on each count 
bakkers wife tammy also a target of the grand jury was not 
indicted 
a second 11count indictment charged david taggart and his 
brother james with tax evasion and conspiracy to impede the 
internal revenue service in the collection of taxes david taggart 
is former ptl vice president and special assistant to bakker james 
is a former interior designer for ptl 
us attorney thomas ashcraft declined to comment or say whether 
other indictments were possible there has already been too much 
publicity on this already and we dont want any more he said 
the defendants were ordered to appear in federal court dec 15 
at jim and tammy ministries the bakkers new organizations 
offices south of charlotte bakkers attorneys jim toms and ryan 
hovis said bakker was trying to deal with the indictments and would 
not have a statement for several days 
certainly theres a degree of discouragement or regret that 
criminal charges were brought against mr bakker toms said but 
hes glad to know what hes facing so he can prepare his defense 
hovis added weve been fishing in a muddy pond up till now it 
looks now like the waters clearing up 
dortch told reporters in clearwater fla where he runs a 
ministry called life challenges that he looked forward to being 
able to tell my side of the story and to put this matter behind 
me he asked from prayers from all of my brothers and sisters in 
the christian community and in the religious community 
the bakkers founded their ministry as trinity broadcasting in 
1972 through the show the ptl club which combined a talkshow 
format with a folksy message of salvation bakker became one of the 
countrys most popular television evangelists and the head of a 
multimilliondollar organization 
but he resigned from ptl in march 1987 after admitting money was 
paid to buy the silence of former church secretary jessica hahn 
about a 1980 sexual encounter in a florida motel room the payment 
totaled 363700 in ministry money 
he admitted the tryst with ms hahn but denied her charge that 
she was an unwilling participant as well as other charges that 
quickly surfaced including financial mismanagement and homosexual 
encounters 
bakkers pentecostal denomination the assemblies of god 
dismissed him and dortch in may 1987 and in june ptl filed for 
protection under federal bankruptcy laws 
ms hahn was one of the first witnesses called to testify before 
the grand jury which began work in august 1987 former ministry 
officials ptl board members and ptl employees also testified behind 
closed doors before the panel 
mondays indictment alleged bakker and dortch diverted ptl funds 
for their own use bakker and his wife were given bonuses totaling 
nearly 35 million and dortch obtained bonuses totaling 550000 
the indictment said 
the indictment also accused dortch of authorizing a payment of 
265000 to ms hahn saying that he asked a contractor to supply 
the funds the contractor roe messner was instructed to get his 
money back by overbilling ptl by the same amount by inflating 
construction costs on a ptl project the indictment said 
messner who was ptls chief builder under bakker was one of 
several targets of the grand jury investigation but he was not 
charged in mondays indictments 
ms hahn who currently works for a radio station in phoenix 
ariz said monday that she had known that indictments were planned 
for more than a year she predicted that bakker would be convicted 
she told a news confrence that she is willing to testify in 
court but other than that wants nothing to do with the story 
this is where it ends for me she said i have lived with this 
for eight years i refuse to be a slave to this any longer 
the indictment charged that in 1984 bakker announced the sale of 
lifetime memberships for the purpose of financing construction of a 
large hotel at heritage usa more than 152000 fully paid 
partnerships were sold producing at least 158 million in revenue 
the indictment said 
the indictment alleged that bakker and dortch made false 
statements to induce people to buy partnerships and that the partner 
funds werent used to construct the lodging facilities that were 
promised 
at the same time bakker and dortch were concealing the true 
financial condition of ptl from the ministrys board of directors 
the indictment said 
the taggarts were accused of diverting 11 million in ptl funds 
to pay personal bills and expenses while failing to report the funds 
as income on their 1983 through 1987 tax returns 
for those years according to the indictment david taggart 
evaded some 320000 in taxes while james taggart evaded taxes 
amounting to some 175000 
while the grand jury met over the last 15 months prosecutors 
called dozens of witnesses and subpoenaed thousands of documents to 
help them learn how the ministry under bakkers leadership from 1980 
to 1987 
some of the records indicate the grand jury focused on the lavish 
lifestyles of the bakkers and others records of travel and 
entertainment expenses credit card charges and advances were among 
the thousands of documents subpoenaed 
in a separate action the bakkers were ordered by a federal 
bankruptcy judge last month to repay ptl 66 million as restitution 
for excessive pay and benefits they received from the tv ministry 
between 1984 and 1987 david taggart was ordered to repay about 11 
million 
that ruling by us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds was the first 
time any court had ruled that bakker or any other ptl leaders had 
used ptl donors money improperly bakkers attorneys have said they 
will appeal 
meanwhile the fate of the ministry just across the south 
carolina border in tiny fort mill remains on hold 
since may a variety of suitors including bakker have tried 
to buy the 1700 acres of undeveloped property the satellite 
television network and heritage usa theme park 
reynolds who has overseen the bankruptcy proceedings has 
scheduled an auction dec 12 after earlier rejecting prior bids 
proceeds will go to satisfy the ministrys debts which could exceed 
130 million 
at one time bakker claimed to have the financing to buy the 
ministry back himself for 172 million but the deal fell through 
when bakker was unable to secure a 3 million down payment

legislators 
at 21 the providence college junior is the latest member of the 
kennedy clan to begin a political career he won a bitterly fought 
democratic primary in september over a fiveterm incumbent and was 
automatically elected from the westside neighborhood because he 
faced no republican opposition 
kennedy the son of sen edward kennedy dmass and nephew of 
former president john f kennedy knows his arrival in the house 
will attract more than normal attention 
there is a certain responsibility youre held accountable for 
not just as a representative from your district but youre held 
accountable for what my familys commitment to public service has 
held for so many people he said 
the legacy of public service doesnt ease the nervousness felt by 
freshman legislators 
i was so nervous getting up today with the microphone im 
going to have to practice kennedy said even my fathers still 
nervous when he gets up to speak 
he says he plans to do his legislative homework early and get to 
legislative leaders while they still are considering changes in 
bills in which he has an interest

can handle his legislative duties as for graduation im in no

more uncertainty shrouds the policy that 
presidentelect george bush will pursue in central america than 
perhaps any other foreign policy issue facing the new 
administration according to experts in and out of government 
bush has been sending mixed signals about his intentions telling 
an interviewer in october he absolutely would support a renewal 
of military aid to the nicaraguan contras under certain conditions 
but leaving a different impression in more recent comments 
no less a foe of contra aid than house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said after a postelection meeting with bush that he is 
encouraged to believe that there is a search for a policy that 
will be acceptable both to bush and the congress 
as an example of bushs seeming ambiguity on the issue he said 
in late november that he has worked long and hard for contra aid 
but is now perfectly willing to encourage the peace process if 
it will lead to democracy in nicaragua he left unclear his position 
on military aid to the rebels

prime minister yasuhiro nakasone stirred the ire of 
us minority groups in 1986 with a remark that japanese were better 
educated than americans because japan is a monoethnic society 
nakasone who is no longer in office later apologized to the 
americans but his remark implicitly denied the existence of japans 
own minority groups chiefly the outcast burakumin the indigenous 
ainus and ethnic koreans 
human rights activists claim those groups along with some 
foreigners living in japan are victimized by social attitudes and 
practices that discriminate against people outside the mainstream of 
society 
the activists hope to raise an awareness among 122 million 
japanese of the plight of japans own minorities with meetings and 
rallies in conjunction with the 40th anniversary dec 10 of the 
united nations declaration of human rights 
a us state department report said in february that burakumin 
ainus and koreans all face entrenched social prejudice 
although the japanese are receptive to foreign ideas the 
report added the citizens of this densely populated nation have a 
cultural ethnic and racial homogeneity which makes them less 
willing to integrate alien residents into their society 
the japanese majority just doesnt pay attention to these 
issues says futaba igarashi secretarygeneral of the democratic

these are descendants of feudalera outcasts in socalled unclean 
professions such as hidetanning and butchering centuries ago they 
were designated to live as outcasts in separate villages or 
buraku prejudice against them was so strong that when maps were 
drawn the buraku were left out 
although their outcast status was abolished by the government in 
1871 there are still 6000 burakumin communities in japan 
according to the burakumin liberation research institute which puts 
their population at 3 million 25 times the governments official 
figure 
racially identical to other japanese the burakumin are still 
perceived to be different 
the unemployment rate for burakumin is about 10 times higher than 
the general populations rate of 26 percent and they face social 
discrimination in part due to japans detailed family registration 
system the system enables companies to check the background of a 
potential employee or a family to check the suitability of a

united nations conferences protesting wide social and economic 
gaps between the ainu people and other japanese people

ethnic origin continue to persist in schools places of employment 
marriages and other aspects of social life said a statement 
presented to the un human rights commission 
in its report to the commission last year the japanese 
government acknowledged for the first time that the ainus possess a 
distinctive religion language and culture but it maintained that 
they enjoy equal protection under the law

nurettin aytun was a high school student 
when he was arrested in 1981 today at age 25 he is still in 
prison awaiting a military courts verdict in his trial on charges 
of terrorist killings and bombings 
my son was held incommunicado for almost two months at the 
police station and then he got transferred to a military prison 
where he spent five years in a cell says his mother leyla 
aytun is one of the 737 defendants on trial in ankara for 
allegedly belonging to the leftist organization devyol 
revolutionary road 
most of the defendants were released over the past two years on 
their own recognizance but 64 defendants remain in prison they 
face the possibility of execution if the verdict is guilty 
halit celenk one of the lawyers for the devyol defendants said 
the verdict may come next year but the appeals process could stretch 
the case into the next century and its possible that aytun and 
other defendants will remain behind bars all that time 
justice so late is no justice says celenk 
in turkey there is no limit on the time a person may be kept in 
jail after arrest in some cases defendants have been sentenced to 
terms shorter than time they had already spent waiting for the end 
of the trial 
attorney ercan kanar calls long trials unjust for those who are 
eventually acquitted 
for example haluk tosun a university professor spent more than 
three years in jail waiting for the start of his trial at the end 
of which he was acquitted 
ersan sansal another lawyer said the courts do not follow any 
objective standards in releasing defendants on bail 
the decisions are taken subjectively by the judges it is not a 
fair practice 
a wave of political terrorism pitting members of a dozen 
militant leftist groups against extreme rightists claimed 5000 
lives in turkey at the end of last decade 
the turmoil triggered a military takeover in 1980 about 30000 
leftist and rightist terrorist suspects were jailed following a 
martial law crackdown on extremist groups 
since then thousands have been released and dozens of trials 
have been concluded but some of the largest mass trials continue 
according to statistics compiled by turkeys human rights 
association an independent group 1392 terrorist suspects are in 
prison and still on trial and 2209 are serving sentences 
of these 227 are on death row but the parliament held back 
approval of carrying out the executions in turkey executions are 
carried out only after a lengthy legal process which includes 
parliamentary ratification and confirmation by the president 
one of the largest mass trials involves 1243 defendants all 
accused members of the devsol organization in the trial being 
held in istanbul since 1982 the court has heard testimony from 
2000 witnesses two months ago defendants finished reading a 
3000page defense plea next some 200 lawyers will take the floor 
to sum up the defense 
in the devyol trial celenk said judges were changed three 
times in the past six years slowing down the case as the newly 
appointed judges took time to study earlier proceedings 
speeding up mass trials may not serve the cause of justice 
however says lawyer haluk turkmen 
the mass trial of 241 suspected devyol members in the eastern 
city of erzincan was finished in 15 months 
there is an easy explanation for the speed of this trial 
said turkmen defendants were given 15 minutes each for a defense 
plea lawyers protesting the restriction refused to speak 
lawyers also complain that it takes the lower courts months 
sometimes years to send their opinions to appeals court for study

because many political and business leaders say 
it is so and renowned academics provide a theoretical base for so 
believing a sense of industrial decline pervades american thinking 
if by chance it is forgotten reports on the trade deficit 
budget deficits weak savings low growth in gross national product 
and apparent weakness in exports restore it to the public 
consciousness 
it is imbedded now part of the national psyche and reflected in 
a morbid sense of inevitable decline comparable to what overtook 
economic empires in the past it contrasts sharply with the old self 
view of america as no 1 
and it might not be justified 
professor richard mckenzie of clemson university believes there 
is evidence in the past few years to question whether the thesis is 
americas fate and instead to wonder if it might be a fiction of 
wellintended but incomplete research 
among his reasons for so believing is that much of the scholarly 
research that led to such assumptions were based on data for the 
1960s and 1970s and that when such data are updated to the 
mid1980s another story emerges 
after updating says mckenzie the data no longer confirm at 
least with the same force popular and scholarly visions of 
relative decline in short many things have changed in the 1980s 
for example mckenzie says us gross national product in 
relation to gnp for the rest of the world did indeed decline from 43 
percent in 1960 to 33 percent in 1975 but it has stabilized since 
then 
a similar pattern shows up in comparisons of american gnp with 
the gnps of major developed countries he says 
in proposing that many fellow academics have made incorrect 
assumptions mckenzie is challenging some of the brightest academic 
writers of popular economic tomes including harvard professors 
robert reich and paul kennedy 
kennedy a harvard historian who remains on some bestseller 
lists with the rise and fall of the great powers says the 
united states must learn how to manage its affairs so that erosion 
takes place slowly and smoothly 
in short an assumption is made that the country is caught in the 
jaws of an unrelenting historical force and that if it cannot 
escape it can at least try to slow the inevitable and attempt to 
make the descent tolerable 
as an example of his thinking mckenzie challenges the popular 
argument that the mounting international trade deficit is prima 
facie evidence of lost competitiveness lost drive and a declining 
standing in the world economy 
in a paper published by washington universitys center for the 
study of american business the professor states that one reason for 
the big trade deficit is faster us economic growth compared to 
many other nations 
with more rapid growth producers need more resources many of 
which must be drawn from abroad in the form of imports he states 
in turn fewer domestic resources are available for the production 
of goods for export 
the decline in real us exports in the 1980s therefore 
probably reflects a significant rise in domestic consumption 
mckenzie says 
again while pessimists complain that the country is being sold 
to foreign interests mckenzie compares the situation to the huge 
foreign investment in us railroads in the 1880s which was the 
foundation of the american empire 
he contends that the correct way to view such foreign investments 
is the same way we view exports of goods and services they are 
products produced by the economy that are attractive to 
foreigners 
while recognizing that scholarly research has gone into many of 
the gloom and doom theses and that america does have serious 
economic problems mckenzie suggests that some extrapolations may be 
premature and perhaps misdirected 
predictions of impending economic calamities are a mainstay of 
american life he concludes they attract a great deal of 
attention sell a lot of books and give life to political movements 
for dramatic changes in policies

west germans are showing sharp 
impatience with foreign nato troops on their soil as their 
perception grows of mikhail s gorbachevs soviet union as a nation 
of peace 
the top us military commander in europe calls it wishful 
thinking 
on nov 22 a british armored unit scrapped plans to enter a 
northern town during maneuvers because the townspeople were fed up 
with the noise and property damage created by war games 
three months earlier a court blocked us army plans to station 
36 helicopters outside wiesbaden the ruling came amid intense local 
opposition to the noise caused by american aircraft and forces 
already in the area 
american troops and other forces of the north atlantic treaty 
organization have been guarding this frontline nation since the end 
of world war ii 
in maneuvers designed to keep the alliances forces at peak 
readiness nato tanks rumble across west german farms and as jet 
aircraft swoop in on low passes 
but west german politicians say they are facing what has become a 
widespread public perception that gorbachev the soviet president 
is a messenger of peace and an accompanying attitude that perhaps 
the hairtrigger military readiness and the resulting inconveniences 
can finally be lessened 
there is a deepseated longing for peace people find the idea 
of lowering the military posture very attractive peter petersen 
a federal lawmaker in chancellor helmut kohls christian democratic 
union told the associated press 
petersen says west germany is a committed nato partner and that 
kohls government sees the foreign troops in his country as still 
necessary for the security of western europe 
but petersen adds that domestic political pressure for a serious 
reduction in lowlevel nato jet flights fewer maneuvers that damage 
property and other demands cannot be ignored 
karsten voigt a lawmaker with the leftleaning opposition social 
democrats agreed 
it is increasingly difficult for politicians of all political 
colors to defend defensive needs against regional and national 
pressures voigt said at the nov 1318 hamburg congress of the 
north atlantic assembly an independent body of lawmakers from the 
16 nato nations 
the social democrats have taken a harder stance than the 
christian democrats maintaining that natos overall defense 
strategy is outdated and needs to be reworked 
us military officials and conservative american politicians in 
recent months have been aggressively trying to counteract west 
european perceptions of gorbachev as a peacemaker 
we must not get a distorted idea of what is really happening 
gen john galvin supreme allied commander in europe recently told 
reporters wishful thinking is causing the west to get deeper into 
a situation in which support for deterrence may be seriously 
threatened 
a new west german unease about foreign troops on their soil has 
become especially apparent during the debate in nato over 
burdensharing 
us officials charge that western europe is not shouldering its 
fair share of natos financial burden and are asking west germany 
and other countries to spend more for defense 
the accusation is a sensitive one in west germany where about 
400000 foreign nato troops including 250000 americans are based 
kohl himself has suggested that his countrymen already endure 
enough inconvenience because of nato troops on their soil 
kohl and other west german officials suggest the united states 
should not be looking just at dollars and cents when weighing each 
nato nations contribution to the alliance 
the west germans say other factors should be assessed as well 
such as foreign tanks tearing up farmland and fears among the 
population caused by lowlevel flights by military jets 
there are 5000 military exercises in this densely populated 
country each year said petersen the christian democrat lawmaker 
theres no piece of real estate where you have a greater 
concentration of soldiers and weapons including nuclear weapons 
the americans should understand these burdens we want them to 
stay here but they must realize this is a political burden 
west german unease about foreign troops has increased this year 
amid a rash of nato jet crashes and the fiery air show disaster 
aug 28 at the us air force base in ramstein 
thomas enders a political scientist at the german society for 
foreign politics said a recent survey indicated that about 80 
percent of west germans backs nato but he added that a resurgence 
of neutralism within west germany could grow with gorbachev in 
power in the soviet union 
an poll this past summer indicated that 71 percent of west 
germans had a favorable opinion of gorbachev compared with only 41 
percent for president reagan 
but kohls government assures its transatlantic allies that it is 
not convinced the threat from the east has vanished and that west 
germany is committed to keeping nato strong 
said petersen were right next door to east germany so we 
know full well why that is important

while millions of children look forward to a 
jolly old elf coming down the chimney at this time of year theres 
another group that likes to visit the homes of strangers burglars 
police report that only the summer vacation season outdoes the 
christmasnew year holidays for burglaries other crimes also 
increase as pickpockets and thieves prey on travelers and shoppers 
being away from home for a holiday trip or just to visit friends 
for a few hours can be an invitation to burglars one way to 
discourage them is to make the house look like someone is home say 
officials of adt security systems 
leave lights on in several rooms for example and if you will be 
gone for a while attach timers to the lights to turn them on and 
off at varying intervals 
leaving a radio playing tuned to an alltalk station can also 
help by making it sound like people are inside 
and leave drapes and shades in their normal household pattern 
adt officials say 
before leaving turn down the volume of the telephone bells 
constant ringing advertises absence to someone outside 
if going away for an extended trip adt says leave a car parked 
in the driveway and make arrangements to have someone shovel the 
snow if that is needed also cancel all deliveries such as milk 
and newspapers and have a friend collect your mail and put out 
some trash at your home on garbage collection day 
the chubb group of insurance companies reports that many claims 
in this season involve small pilferage officials there urge putting 
small valuables out of sight when having parties doing so before 
caterers arrive can be a good idea 
fire claims also jump at christmas the company says reiterating 
the reminder to make sure the christmas tree is watered and that the 
lights are not left on this may be a good time to check the battery 
in the smoke detector 
whether traveling or shopping never leave visible gifts in an 
unattended car bring them into the motel room with you at a 
shopping center at least lock parcels in the trunk 
while traveling remain constantly wary say security officials 
of the american express company 
thieves operating at airports train stations and other crowded 
areas usually operate in groups of two to four they report one 
crook seeks to distract the victim while an accomplice steals a 
wallet purse or baggage 
ploys can include a seemingly spilled purse a handful of dropped 
coins or other maneuvers 
in some areas pickpockets have even been known to put up signs 
saying beware of pickpockets then they watch people to see 
which pocket they pat after noticing the sign that way the crook 
knows where the valuables are on the potential victim 
never leave baggage unattended american express says because 
many thefts are simply crimes of opportunity when someone puts their 
luggage down to buy a newspaper or other item baggage carts should 
be pushed ahead where they can be seen not pulled along behind and 
out of sight 
men should not carry their wallet in a back pocket it is among 
the easiest to steal from and women should carry handbags with the 
flap turned toward the body and carried against the hip or in front

director cres van keulen whose office is in san francisco says 
there are some 500 formal local programs placing offenders in 
community service jobs averaging about 1000 new cases a year 
she adds that there could be another 1000 informally structured 
operations handling additional placements 
if her estimates are right more than a halfmillion offenders a 
year are sentenced to community service time 
dr alan harland professor of criminal justice at temple 
university says preliminary results of a study hes conducting 
indicate that more than 80 percent of those working off community 
service sentences complete their work 
ms van keulen cited a california study that provides only a 
glimpse of the financial savings in cases where community service 
replaces imprisonment 
sixtythree california programs reported in 1987 that 103000 
offenders worked more than 63 million unpaid hours a saving of 21 
million to volunteer organizations and government agencies if they 
had paid the minimum hourly wage of 335 
another study by the public agenda foundation in new york city 
indicates that the public accepts community service 
observations by 125 people who participated in 10 smallgroup 
discussions said they favored alternatives to imprisonment if an 
offender would face the implications of his crime and undertake 
work that could prove useful 
one unscientific sign of success comes from program participants 
petty thieves and whitecollar criminals alike spoke favorably of 
the experience 
sterling hall who says he was convicted three dozen times for 
shoplifting a claim borne out by the vera institutes records 
claims his second community service tour of 70 hours helped him 
develop good work habits 
it has shown me teamwork he says it gave me personal 
selfworth it got me getting up in the morning it gets you used to 
taking orders 
it saves the city quite a bit of money its more logical than 
having the city send a person to jail where they have to take care 
of him and feed him 
but hall wouldnt guarantee that he would go straight i will 
probably have the same problems as before he says you need 
money to pay rent 
young the man convicted of stealing the lone rangers pistols 
says he hopes his work at the stables will free officers to 
concentrate on patrolling the streets 
community service gives you time to reevaluate your life and 
think about whats important he says a lot of people take 
freedom for granted it makes you see what the value of freedom is 
zaccaro now 24 says he began to pay back society with community 
service time even before his sentencing last spring when he 
volunteered at covenant house a shelter for runaways in new york 
city 
i went to work in their van traveling to the worst 
neighborhoods in new york talking to prostitutes and drug users 
he says we gave them sandwiches and tried to get them on the 
right track i saw the worst that any city has to offer 
at the king street youth program zaccaro was closest to the 
teenagers and counseled them against the use of drugs 
you get out of it what you put in he says recalling his 
60hour work weeks king street would not be able to run without 
volunteers like myself 
frances ellen who served three months in prison and 1500 hours 
community service for income tax and securities violations spent 
her time designing and leading support groups for other offenders 
its sort of like having a major heart attack she says 
how do you restore yourself we showed them how to deal with 
guilt shame embarrassment the sense of selfesteem that had been 
destroyed all emotions she personally experienced 
ms ellen of los angeles was coowner of an investment firm 
she says she and her partner were responsible for mismanagement that 
cost their customers 13 million 
community service made me come out of myself and to look at the 
consequences of my action on other people she says 
although her community service time is over ms ellen continues 
to volunteer her time with foundation for people the community 
service group for which she established the group sessions 
also working for pay as a business consultant ms ellen says she 
never misses a chance to lecture employers on business ethics and 
she has established a plan to pay some 5 million back to those who 
lost money with her nowbankrupt firm 
she says now my life is about contributions to the society i 
damaged

editors note everybody knows the ghost of christmas past in 
charles dickens a christmas carol but less celebrated spooks 
have haunted the season for a long time heres an account of their 
ectoplasmic activities

long before and long after jacob marley rattled his rosary of 
cash boxes keys and padlocks at ebenezer scrooge a christmas 
ghost more surely than santa would appear at the fireside of many 
a stately home and country inn 
holiday guests overstuffed with roast goose and mulled port were 
less likely to be dreaming of a white christmas than having 
nightmares about graveyard rats gnawing at the tree ornaments or 
goblins kidnapping a church sexton 
that matter of the vanishing verger was charles dickenss first 
published christmas ghost story inspired by a bedtime tale told by 
mary weller the dickens family nursemaid she filled his 
imagination with the phantoms of evil innkeepers making sausage pies 
out of complaining guests and hapless travelers terribly tortured by 
rats phantoms that reappeared in his annual tales to trim the tree 
by 
mary herself reappeared in the holly tree that snowbound inn 
on the yorkshire moors where the storyteller at the fireside reaches 
back to the nursery and finds himself at the knee of a sallow 
woman with a fishy eye an aquiline nose and a green gown whose 
specialty was a dismal narrative of a landlord whose visitors 
unaccountably disappeared 
your genial host at this early variant of the bates motel stole 
into the guest rooms by a secret passage slit their throats then 
dispatched the bodies down a trap door to copper cauldrons bubbling 
below 
the pie maker was undone as dickens respun the cobwebs of his 
childhood when overheard muttering too much pepper in his 
troubled sleep 
ghosts at christmas why not a child is born but the year is 
dying tis the season to be mindful of our mortality 
all the way back to bethlehem when the ox and ass knelt with the 
shepherds at the manger and the magi magicians or wise men from the 
east came calling christmas has been a time of mystery and magic 
the christmas ghost is older in tradition than the fir tree 
trimmed with lights or stockings hung by the chimney with care the 
horror has always gone with the holly as the wise men knew when 
they offered the newborn babe the gift myrrh a burial spice from 
their camel bags 
in victorian times a ghost for christmas was as common as a 
goose 
with the publication of a christmas carol in 1843 charles 
dickens became the acknowledged master of the seasonal spooky story 
which he did not invent but refined into an annual event even under 
pressure of unfinished novels long past the publishers deadline a 
grim dickensian word he would not give up the christmas ghost i 
am loath to lose the money he admitted and still more so to 
leave any gap at christmas firesides which i ought to fill 
christmas ghosts hovered over the writing desks of sir walter 
scott nathaniel hawthorne wilkie collins william thackeray 
charles reade rudyard kipling elizabeth bowen lp hartley and 
lord dunsany to name but a few 
english french scandinavian and american literature abound with 
christmas ghouls trolls and goblins 
such merry merchants of the macabre as algernon blackwood hp 
lovecraft sheridan lefanu saki and ww jacobs of the monkeys 
paw fame observed christmas with a grisly gothic gift to their 
readers 
as the last line hauntingly confirms james joyces the dead 
is a classic christmas ghost story his soul swooned slowly as he 
heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly 
falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and 
the dead 
in a holiday tale of malicious merriment english humorist jerome 
k jerome warns guests against spending the night in the blue 
chamber of his uncles country manor the room is haunted every 
christmas eve by the ghost of a most sinful man who once killed a 
christmas carol singer with a lump of coal for singing off key 
the spirit of this sensitive music lover did not like to appear 
to be boasting but he also dispatched seven street musicians 
counting trombones an italian lad who came to town with a 
barrel organ that played nothing but scotch airs and an entire 
german oompah band 
a halfcentury later in a christmas issue of the new yorker 
cartoonist charles addams struck another blow for noel noise 
abatement his fiendish friends are seen up on the roof of their 
haunted town house pouring down boiling oil on the carolers gathered 
on the front stoop 
what is it that makes human beings at christmas request a very 
carnival of crime asked ambrose bierce lexicographer of the

my last crime was a christmas crime arch thief flambeau 
confesses to gk chestertons father brown a cheery cosy 
english middleclass crime a crime of charles dickens i did it in 
a good old middleclass house near putney a house with a crescent 
of a carriage drive a house with a stable by the side of it a 
house with a name on the two outer gatesenough you know the 
species 
the eager christmas reading public certainly knew the species 
they had been conditioned to it by decades of ghosts haunting the 
pages of the christmas annuals and special gift books often 
sponsored by royalty that were a matter of pride and profit to 
authors and publishers from victorian times down to the end of world 
war ii when tv became the main medium so to speak for encounters 
of the spectral kind 
these expensively bound and strikingly illustrated volumes had 
names like yule logs christmas blossoms winters wreath queen 
marys gift book christmas box princess alexandras gift book 
beetons christmas annual the snowflake longmans annual and st 
nicholas which its boston publishers avowed was a christmas and 
new years gift made expressly under the direction of st nicholas 
for all good little girls and boys 
in 1834 almost a decade before scrooge pronounced christmas a 
humbug there were 63 competing annuals on sale in london some 
running to 450 pages 
these sold at an upscale enhanced price so the writers 
market definitely improved at christmas said charles benson 
curator of rare books at dublins trinity college library in his 
cubicle of an office looking down on the vaulted reading room where 
lord dunsany and elizabeth bowen conjured up their christmas ghosts 
and where the 8th century book of kells is on display benson spread 
out several editions of beetons and longmans annuals dating back 
to l870s 
the enormous demand for these gift books coincided with the 
rapid rise in literacy throughout europe the curator went on 
prominently placed on the living room table they proclaimed both 
the giver and the recipient to be people of some culture 
sherlock holmes made his first appearance in a study in 
scarlet in beetons 1887 christmas annual author a conan doyle 
said the title recognized the scarlet thread of murder running 
through the colorless skein of life 
edgar allen poe and mary shelley creator of frankenstein 
frequently contributed to gift books hawthorne raised his earliest 
puritan phantoms in the pages of the token and goodrichs annual 
ghosts began to disappear when electricity came in lamented 
librarian benson you seldom get a dark countryside now those 
lonely stretches of road lined with skeletal trees with mist rising 
from the bogs and the fields shrouded in snow all so essential for 
contacting the beyond christmas then was a time for ghosts because 
as the days grew shorter the peasants and the landed gentry had 
more leisure to swap tales around their fires life was short and 
precarious people were much closer to death and the spirit world 
ghost stories are for telling aloud as well as reading as 
dickens soon discovered to his pleasure and profit a consummate 
actor he took scrooge on the road an overflow crowd of 4000 
turned up at bradfords mechanics institute for his threehour 
stagecut reading of a christmas carol and 2000 jammed into 
birminghams town hall a new career and a new tradition were 
launched 
on the night before christmas at hyde park franklin d roosevelt 
always read a christmas carol aloud to the family acting out 
all the parts banker jp morgan bought the original dickens 
manuscript and like the bornagain scrooge merry as a 
schoolboy had his secretary read it to him each christmas eve 
cambridge don mr james a learned antiquary and translator of 
new testament apocrypha read aloud his devilishly clever ghost 
stories to friends at kings college every christmas eve for more 
than three decades beginning in 1894 as provost of eton college 
he concocted many of his holiday horrors for the small boys in his 
charge and wrote the haunted dolls house specifically for the 
library of her majesty the queens dolls house 
american novelist and global railway chronicler paul theroux who 
lives in london has kept alive this haunting holiday tradition 
every year when his boys marcel and louis were growing up he wrote 
and read to them over three nights a ghost story leaving the 
hammer stroke for christmas eve 
like dickens urchins peeking through the frosted panes of the 
bakery the audience of two was allowed to windowshop for the 
ingredients their requirements a scary ghost lots of snow a 
london setting a happy ending and oh yes please put a cat in 
at hardscribble house in rural connecticut where this is being 
handcrafted at a wobbly victorian standup writing desk we refuse 
to let old spooks lie ghost stories are always told over a flagon 
of smoking bishop or hot purl the lady of the house being from 
ireland where spectral visitors outnumber poor relations around the 
fireside at christmas and our guest room is seasonally haunted by 
the mournful whistle and dull headlight glow of a long vanished 
lionel model train set endlessly circling beneath the bed on rusty 
rails 
or could it be the rats from the graveyard across the road 
scratching out winter quarters beneath the floorboards and 
occasionally venturing out to search for food with those baleful 
eyes

editors note it is designated as a national historic monument 
the last rural chinese town in america but while locke calif was 
once the home of hundreds of immigrant laborers who were unwelcome 
in white communities few chinese are left in the town today and 
those who remain are dying out 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lost in limbo between the past and the 
future the tiny town of locke is quietly decaying on the bank of 
the sacramento river a sad footnote in the history of america 
the sagging woodframe buildings along the blocklong main street 
are the legacy of chinese immigrants who came to california seeking 
a better life and found that the quest of the american dream can be 
a nightmare 
in the 20s and 30s chinese villages like locke now 
designated a national historic monument housed the laborers who 
built the levees and tilled the fields of californias upper san 
joaquin valley 
more than 600 people mostly men lived in locke thousands more 
would jam the town on weekends spending hardearned meager wages in 
gambling halls four restaurants a halfdozen markets and five 
bordellos 
the chinese towns thrived because residents werent welcome in 
most other communities the chinese could work 10hour days in the 
white world for 1 a day or less but they too often became targets 
for racist attacks at night the white folks had their towns the 
chinese had theirs 
that changed when japan invaded china and bombed pearl harbor 
the ensuing war forever changed the status of chinese immigrants in 
america it also marked the beginning of the end for locke 
after the war the chinese were more readily welcomed into 
mainstream america opening doors of opportunity leading out of the 
rural ghettos 
locke the last rural chinese town in america has about 120 
residents now almost all are relative newcomers and only 24 are of 
chinese descent some work in town or nearby others are artists and 
the rest are retired 
the oncebustling main street is now still except on weekends 
when the curious stop by to visit the art gallery the curio shops 
or the two restaurants one restaurant is chinese the other which 
also serves as an ersatz town center is universally known as al 
the wops 
today only four longtime chinese residents remain in locke they 
are the first to admit they are dying out four others have died in 
the past year 
thats exactly the right word dying out says ping lee 
who at 71 is the youngest of the towns elders his father founded 
locke nee lockeport in 1915 lee himself tried to leave locke but 
was drawn back by his fathers business 
i saw locke falling so fast and the population falling 
because the older people are dying off and there are no young people 
coming on 
today lee is proprietor of the big store market in nearby walnut 
grove but he still lives in the quiet river town of his birth in a 
humble home along one of the towns two back roads 
his neighbor tommy king 75 has lived in locke since 1927 he 
left only once to serve in the air force as a radio repairman 
during world war ii before the war he was a laborer even now the 
pain of those days is enough to disturb his usually placid demeanor 
ever work for 10 cents an hour i didnt even get that i 
worked 10 hours for a buck during the depression it went lower 
than that it went to 75 cents a day picking tomatoes now 
tomatoes are 70 cents a pound now you see a dime in the road and 
you let it sit there its not worth bending over to pick it up 
king whose wife connie runs a gallery on main street and 
most of the other elders didnt even realize in their youth they 
were victims of discrimination 
i think i was too young to comprehend what was happening he 
recalls sitting in the sun on a homemade bench in the vegetable 
garden beside his home we went to segregated schools and we just 
thought thats the way it is 
king and lee compare the plight of chinese laborers to the 
treatment of mexican migrant laborers in california today 
but actually theyre better off than my ancestors king says 
because the mexicans are protected by law 
chinese immigrants were victimized by law under the california 
1913 alien land act chinese were barred from owning land the law 
was not declared unconstitutional until 1952 
because of that law locke was built on a 500acre ranch owned by 
george locke although the chinese built their homes here they have 
never owned the land even today the houses are owned by 
individuals the land is owned by a corporation but today the 
corporation is owned by chinese 
the injustices of the past the ownership of the land the 
designation of locke as a national monument and the passing of the 
town elders has left the towns residents worried about the future 
there is endless debate about what could happen what will happen 
what should happen

editors note soap operas are not known for heavy social 
philosophy or ethnic diversity so it was unusual to say the least 
for two orthodox jews to make an appearance on nbcs day of our 
lives the explanation is leah laiman and she knew whereof she 
wrote 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
leah laimans life would make a lousy soap opera 
she was raised an orthodox jew in hamilton ontario where she 
spent her weekends reading the classics she moved to new york and 
attended a jewish womens college she did hang around greenwich 
village one summer though she didnt exactly blend into the crowd 
i was the only orthodox kosher virgin beatnik in new york she 
says until her father showed up to take her home 
it is therefore no small irony that laiman a woman with barely 
a nodding acquaintance with lifes seamy side should wind up as the 
head writer for one of the seamier soaps nbcs days of our 
lives 
soap opera digest rated it the most violent soap on television 
bad planning laiman explains murder and mayhem are simply a 
cheap way to end a friday the show did go through a period where 
there was a lot of violence toward women im sorry for that 
other than that though laiman makes no apology for the violence 
and sex served up on her soap sure soap operas are full of sex 
and violence she says but they are not like movies and they 
arent rated r there is a limit to what you can do 
and in a way soaps are very moralistic yes people do naughty 
things but the bad people always get punished the good guys always 
win and get lots of fan mail 
salem usa the shows fictional location is a slightly more 
enlightened place than the whitebread town laiman found when 
she moved over from abcs general hospital three years ago 
like most soap opera settings salem remains overwhelmingly white 
middle class there are two blacks she says and everybodys 
christian 
not quite everyone it turns out 
enter the first orthodox jewish characters in the soap operas 
history 
some people who watch these shows probably dont know any 
jews she explains i just wanted to show they have no horns 
she created robin a beautiful young doctor who just happened to 
be an orthodox jew robin fell in love with mike also a doctor and 
as luck would have it a christian 
robins father was a pharmacist he wore a yarmulke all the 
time robin never ate out in the nonkosher cafeteria at the 
hospital all she could eat was salad 
since intimate dinner dates are a soap opera staple laiman 
created a kosher deli and saw to it robin stayed home on the 
sabbath on friday nights she lit candles and wouldnt answer the 
phone or ride in the car unless it was a medical emergency 
mike gave serious thought to converting then realized he 
couldnt give up his heritage eventually laiman resolved the plot 
by having robin and her father leave town 
laiman regrets that their departure meant there were no more jews 
in salem still the alternatives would have been worse for robin 
to marry a nonjew or worse to abandon her own religion would be 
out of the question 
in charting the soaps plot laiman remains mindful of her 
influence over the audience i would never let a woman have an 
abortion and go crazy about it she says i might not have an 
abortion myself but its not up to me to put that in the show and 
influence people 
after six years in the soap opera business she worked on 
general hospital for three years before moving to days 
laiman says im still shocked to this day that people respond to 
the show the way they do they identify so totally with these 
peoples lives they see them only as these characters 
as head writer laimans job is to map out the story which is 
subject to approval by the network associate head writers break the 
plot down into daily segments dialogue writers fill in the daily 
scripts 
the show is filmed in los angeles but laiman prefers to stay in 
new york she travels to the west coast for meetings but spends 
most of her time in the manhattan apartment she shares with her 
husband producerdirector ralph toporoff her stepdaughter 
melinda 19 and her 15monthold baby danielle the couple also 
has a stepson ian 23 
writing a soap opera doesnt require tremendous writing talent 
though it does require skill and understanding of the medium 
laiman says 
soaps appeal to middleoftheroad conservatives television is 
not about public service its about advertising dollars and ratings 
and not offending viewers 
still she keeps an eye out for ways to incorporate her values 
into the show and to pass along responsible information whenever 
possible 
when the story line dealt with sex abuse laiman included a 
hotline number at the end of the episode she also tried to make 
it very clear that sexual abuse is not the victims fault 
with robins departure salem is for the time being once again 
an allchristian town but laiman says plans are already in the 
works to bring robin back 
in the meantime there are other ways to get her points across 
coming up a love story involving a plastic surgeon who happens to 
be black

editors note west virginia seemed like a prime proving ground 
when congress created the office of economic opportunity in 1964 
one of the first and one of the biggest of the antipoverty agencies 
was set up in mingo county one of the most stubborn pockets of 
poverty in all of appalachia but over the years the mingo county 
economic opportunity commission fell into the hands of a corrupt 
political establishment it was created to fight 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the 1960s when congress voted to 
fight poverty by organizing the poor to fight for themselves the 
rallying cry was power to the people 
what developed in mingo county lends credence to a much older 
adage power corrupts 
in 1965 when the mingo county economic opportunity commission 
was formed the antipoverty agency quickly became a thorn in the 
side of the political establishment but over the years it became an 
ally of the establishment until federal prosecutors started sending 
eoc officials to jail 
the eoc was a product of the 1960s and the 1960s was a very 
antiestablishment period says carl bradford trustee director of 
the mingo county eoc all this was done the way the eoc wanted it 
done and the idea was to give them lots of money to go out and beat 
up on the establishment 
lots of money was the key especially in a place like mingo 
county where it seems there is never enough to go around today 
the eocs annual 16 million budget is a major economic force in 
the county second only to the county commission which has a budget 
of 274 million and the board of education which controls 20 
percent of the jobs in the county the eoc provides jobs and 
essential services to some 2000 mingo residents 
but somewhere along the way the power and money corrupted at 
least five top eoc officials have been convicted on federal charges 
of defrauding the agency including longtime director larry 
hamrick he was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for 
siphoning off antipoverty funds for his personal use and to 
influence county politicians 
hamrick allegedly defrauded the antipoverty commission of more 
than 60000 prosecutors said he ordered checks totaling more than 
42000 to be written to one individual purportedly for hauling 
coal to lowincome families they said however that the bulk of 
the money was kicked back to hamrick 
hamrick also allegedly arranged for employees to be listed on the 
commission books as jobtraining developers when they actually had 
jobs within the agency prosecutors said hamrick also arranged for 
about 10500 to be given from the eocs administrative account to 
relatives of a commission employee money that also came back to 
hamrick 
hamrick after pleading guilty to charges of fraud obstruction 
of justice and conspiracy testified in another mingo county trial 
that he on several occasions approved travel checks for don chafin 
an eoc official who also pleaded guilty to fraud charges hamrick 
said there was no basis for the checks other than chafin said 
he was short money in his checking account 
on other occasions hamrick said he and chafin shared the 
proceeds of checks made out to another eoc employee who cashed 
them and gave the money back to me and i split it with don chafin 
exactly even 
money is what runs through the veins of the political system 
and they found the fountain of youth says assistant us attorney 
joe savage 
west virginia seemed like a prime proving ground when congress 
created the office of economic opportunity in 1964 the act spawned 
community action agencies nationwide all based on the idea that 
poverty could be eradicated by giving poor people the power to 
challenge the forces that kept them poor one of the first and one 
of the biggest was quickly set up in mingo county one of the most 
stubborn pockets of poverty in all of appalachia

congress decided that lowincome people were suffering because 
government and the rest of the establishment wasnt giving them 
their fair share bradford says it was set up to attack local 
government as a grass roots organization 
organization was the second key bradford said the way to attack 
the local power structure was obvious 
once you get past picketing and protesting as a method of 
forcing change the more effective way is at the ballot box 
bradford says the eocs first director a young mingo county 
teacher named huey perry capitalized on the power to the people 
mandate and quickly organized the poor into a counter political 
structure 
perry now a huntington businessman manufacturing medical 
equipment contends that the success of the concept was its 
downfall he described his experiences with the eoc and its fight 
with the mingo power structure in a 1975 book called theyll cut 
off your project that success was a threat perry said and in 
1968 congress changed the laws governing the offfice of economic 
opportunity to take away the antipoverty agencies independence and 
return control to county governments 
all of our expectations were very high that we were going to 
be able to turn things around perry says but at the national 
level they didnt want it it was too much upheaval that had to be 
stopped and i dont think well ever see that kind of social 
experiment again 
with those changes the social experiment soon became part of 
the existing power structure perry moved on to other projects and 
the man he had hired as his deputy larry hamrick took over as 
director 
hamrick would literally have taken the shirt off his back and 
given it to you if he thought you needed it perry says he tells 
how one day he and hamrick spotted a car that had gone off the 
narrow highway and into a stream badly swollen by recent rains 
larry didnt hesitate perry says he jumped out of our car 
and was in that water waist deep to pull people out of that car 
a very different man was described in the federal indictments 
that sent hamrick to prison according to one indictment hamrick 
threatened a hospitalized man who was a prosecution witness 
pointing to the oxygen tank by the bed of kenneth bubby 
phillips hamrick told him there could be carbon monoxide in 
it hamrick also was accused of intimidating another grand jury 
witness putting his hands around her throat and threatening to 
choke her to death 
after the federal government returned power over the poverty 
agencies to county government perry said i guess larry chose to 
work with them became entailed in the system and became part of 
it 
at first he probably rationalized that he was protecting the 
poor people in what he was doinghad he not chosen the path he 
did he would have been fired within the year and the director would 
have been somebody else the machine could have controlled 
these days the mingo county eoc is firmly in the control of the 
establishment this time however the establishment appears to be 
republican an oddity in heavily democratic mingo county a group 
calling itself voices of concern has demanded the resignation of 
executive director tim crum a registered republican who was elected 
mayor of the town of kermit on a nonpartisan ticket and has 
expressed concern that the agency has become a gop stronghold 
crum was recommended to the eoc board by bradford who was 
appointed eoc trustee director by republican gov arch moore when 
hamrick was indicted 
regardless of who is in control in mingo county perry says he 
believes that the economic system the eoc tried to challenge is the 
source of mingos political quagmire theres no question in my 
mind that the poverty there breeds this kind of politics he says 
people who are ambitious see politics as the way you make 
money the way you succeed the way you get power but if the 
economy were better ambitious people might try to succeed in some 
economic sense

editors note growing up in idaho terry domico never cared 
much for bears so the freelance writer wasnt exactly thrilled 
when a literay agent suggested that he do a book about the beasts 
but he wound up traveling around the world photographing and 
observing bears in the wild and in the process became an ardent 
advocate of protecting endangered animals

terry domico and his japanese companions quietly 
approach a black bear den on japans honchu island with plans to 
film the hibernating beast through a hole in the den wall 
all of a sudden a 400pound ball of fur and teeth explodes from 
the snow 
the bear grabs the shirt of a graduate student as another student 
and a researcher try to flee floundering in the deep spring snow 
domico pulls a canister of bear repellent that he has never used 
before from his back pocket one shot of the stuff from about 12 
feet away is enough to make the animal release the student 
but the bear then turns on domico he screams no and fires 
one more shot of repellent into the bears face sending the huge 
animal running 
domico recalls dropping into the snow shaking and turning on 
his tape recorder to babble his impressions of the experience 
the attack was just one of the adventures domico 43 a 
freelance writer and photographer who lives on san juan island in 
washington state had while researching his book bears of the 
world 
domico and his publisher pitch the book released in november by 
facts on file inc in new york as an uptodate authoritative book 
on bears 
among the few westerners allowed into the wolong panda preserve 
in china domico and fellow photographer mark newman went in 1987 
for an update on the 27 million project sponsored by world 
wildlife fund international 
what they found they say was a drop in the panda population 
partly because of heavy timber harvesting and farming on the 
preserve they also discovered illegal markets that sell panda and 
other animal parts considered valuable for medicinal purposes 
i was so incensed domico says according to chinese 
estimates there were 700 pandas in 1987 now theyre talking 500 
they cant lose 200 pandas a year or theyre not going to have 
any 
on the malaysian island of borneo domico estimates that no more 
than 500 sun bears survive 
adult bears are poached for their meat and the cubs are raised as 
pets until theyre confiscated by the government and released to the 
wild where their fate is unknown 
domico and newman never found a totally wild sun bear but for 
many days observed and photographed one released to the wild and 
actually helped the bear learn to be a bear 
domico who grew up in idaho wasnt initially enthused when a 
literary agent suggested a book about bears 
i started this with all kinds of prejudices he says i 
personally didnt like bears very much i was scared of them but i 
soon learned that everything i knew about bears was wrong and i was 
hooked 
im not afraid of them now but i respect them very much 
domicos book says gerard helferich editor in chief for facts 
on file explodes a lot of myths about bears 
for instance domico says bears can see much better than is 
commonly thought they look peripherally avoiding direct stares 
because that constitutes a challenge and almost always leads to 
confrontation 
domico photographed legendary kermode bear an endangered 
subspecies that is white and lives in northern british columbia a 
british columbia conservation officer led him to their secret home 
after domico promised he wouldnt divulge the location 
many bears including the black brown and polar bear are doing 
quite well worldwide domico learned they are being better managed 
and their habitat has improved 
but theyre also getting 90 percent of the money being spent on 
bears says dr charles jonkel of the university of montanas 
environmental studies program the man domico calls the father of 
bear biology 
by comparison the endangered panda sun and spectacled bears 
which exist only in china southeast asia and south america 
respectively cant be properly supported by their governments 
which are struggling to feed their human populations domico says 
conservation is a pastime of rich nations he says but one 
thing china is sensitive to is outside criticism public opinion 
will force china to save the pandas 
domico is urging letter writing campaigns by wwf national 
geographic and environmentalists to improve the savethepanda 
effort and to initiate campaigns to save the sun and spectacled 
bears 
the malaysian reserves are isolated he says if theyre 
going to save sun bears and other large species theyre going to 
have to keep those areas contiguous china has to streamline its 
bureaucracy so its effective most of the money gets spent on 
bureaucracy before it ever gets down to where the animal is 
china within the last year imposed sentences of life in prison or 
death for panda poachers and rich block director of public 
programs for the american chapter of wwf in washington dc says 
several people are serving life terms for the crime 
domico also is encouraging western zoos to better coordinate 
captive breeding programs there are fewer than 20 pandas 
permanently in western zoos and loan programs are declining in 
popularity as scientists question whether the loan program does the 
pandas cause any good block says the captive breeding effort may 
have to remain concentrated in china 
domico says he hopes the 189page book which includes a safety 
manual will help highlight the plight of some bear species and do 
for them what whale books written 15 years ago did for that species

its no mystery why actor sam robards quit the 
legitimate theater and went hunting for a television series 
i needed to make some money says robards who comes from a 
distinguished acting family with roots in new york i spent seven 
years working in the theater i was tired of making 160 a week and 
being in debt all the time 
robards and his wife actress suzy amis packed up moved from 
new york into a rented house in los angeles and bought furniture at 
garage sales their marriage was a case of life imitating art they 
played husband and wife in the movie fandango and afterward got 
married 
i came out for the pilot season and read for a whole mess of 
things he says i was offered two pilots and i chose this 
one 
the one he chose was tv 101 a onehour drama on cbs about a 
high school journalism teacher who brings the school newspaper into 
the electronic age he sets up a television news show on the 
schools internal network which enables the student journalists to 
learn according to network publicity as much about themselves and 
their own lives as they do about television 
robards stars as kevin keegan an iconoclast whose return to 
teaching at his alma mater doesnt inspire enthusiasm from the 
principal who remembers his troubled days as a student 
robards had to read seven times for the role twice after he did 
a screen test i was the first person they saw for the role he 
says but they were committed to the great american talent search 
they went to new york chicago they saw everybody i had to fight 
for the role 
on a lunch break at the culver studios robards eats soup from a 
large styrofoam cup in a barren conference room he has the flu but 
is fighting it rather than miss a days work 
robards has butted heads with the producers at grant tinkers gtg 
entertainment over interpretation of his character 
the way i play him is decidedly different from the way the 
creators saw him he says i guess were ironing it out as we go 
along 
to me keegans a guy whos lost hes been through a lot hes 
seen a lot but hes lost especially in this environment their 
idea is that hes sort of able to get by there are no 
lifeanddeath issues for him except when it comes to his daughter 
and exwife 
the story presents keegan as a former freelance television 
newsman who has worked in latin america 
he witnessed a lot of unpleasantness but he was just an 
observer robards says that was how he got by im just 
shooting it with my camera so im not responsible for any of it 
so after being complacent and irresponsible he comes into the 
school and tries to make a difference 
like most of the cast on tv 101 robards is a virtual 
newcomer to the television audience he starred earlier this season 
with valerie bertinelli in pancho barnes he has also done a few 
guest roles on series and has a tiny role in the movie bird he 
has an equally small part in director brian de palmas upcoming 
vietnam film casualties of war 
i guess it was deliberate to put so many new people in the cast 
so you wouldnt have anyone overshadowing the concept of the show 
he says 
robards is the son of jason robards jr and lauren bacall his 
grandfather was the late character actor jason robards sr 
although he grew up in an acting household he went through the 
usual boyhood ambitions such as policeman and ballplayer before 
becoming an actor at the age of 19 
i was ejected from sarah lawrence college for lousy grades 
he says id always played football throughout my school years 
when i left school i went to the eugene oneill theater center in 
connecticut and studied there for a while then i went on an 
audition and got a job as an understudy and assistant stage manager 
acting wasnt something id dreamed about id been around it 
all my life i knew the business side of it it wasnt so glamorous 
the stage is where you do the best acting but theres no money in 
it i tried films if i can make a name for myself i can get better 
parts instead of being the first man they see after lunch 
with his father he has done only a few scenes excerpts from 
oneills long days journey into night that deal with 
alcoholism 
i guess we did it in part because my father had been 
addicted he says that play illustrates so clearly its effects 
on a family 
robards isnt sure whether having famous parents was a help or 
not 
i think i was seen for a lot of things because of my parents 
he says people wanted to see if i was capable of doing anything 
some people had a preconception and looked for something bad its 
getting better now i can be more on my own

at 19 barry williams was a television 
heartthrob receiving 800 fan letters a week at 25 he had to 
scramble for work redirecting his faltering career from television 
to theater 
now nearly 20 years after he first played older brother greg 
brady on the brady bunch the 34yearold williams finds himself 
doing both theater and television 
hes making his broadway debut in the musical romance romance 
and appearing in a new brady bunch special a very brady 
christmas to be televised sunday dec 18 on cbs 
part of an actors life is just being ready tuned and 
stretched to work he says although he asked to look at the 
script before he decided to do the new brady movie but when the 
chance came to audition for romance romance he didnt hesitate 
its not as if williams hadnt done any musicals recently in 
fact he has done four in the last year in places such as kansas 
city pittsburgh and birmingham mich 
williams joined the cast of romance romance in october the 
show running since may at the helen hayes theater is two small 
musicals in one in act i the actor plays an amorous 
turnofthecentury viennese dandy in the second act hes a 
happily married man contemplating an affair 
i dont think ive had a better role in terms of scope and in 
terms of growth he says they are two separate musicals with 
completely different acting styles i have to be in top shape for 
this show 
williams wasnt always a singer he started studying at 16 during 
the glory days of the brady bunch the show which ran for five 
seasons on abc was one of the last of the innocent family comedies 
the cast included a widow a widower six kids a maid and a dog 
problems were resolved happily before the last commercial 
williams who was raised in california started performing at age 
11 after persuading his parents to let him attend acting classes 
i was pretty precocious as a child he recalls i liked the 
idea of being different people and characters kind of what acting 
is it looked like a fun thing to do 
before being cast on the brady bunch williams appeared on 
just about every wellknown television series of the late 1960s 
from the fbi to that girl to gomer pyle to it takes a 
thief to mod squad to marcus welby he found work the 
brady bunch pretty much monopolized his teenage years 
when youve only got one childhood you dont know if youre 
missing a normal one or not he says i think being a teenager 
is a fate akin to illness its a very difficult period any way you 
cut it 
williams problems started later 
in my own life i found that i went through my own teenage 
rebellion in my mid20s because i had to be so serious and 
responsible as a teenager he says i didnt have time to 
rebel 
typecast because of his association with the brady bunch and 
regarded within the television industry as only capable of light 
comedy he was thought of as a teenager even after he passed 21 
i didnt understand why i had to audition williams recalls 
after all i had credits i had been working a long time its a 
very arrogant attitude ludicrous in this business i was back on 
the proving block again and i didnt feel that i was supposed to 
prove myself 
still williams got jobs he always was able to do several 
musicals or regional theater offerings a year but that would leave 
periods of six or seven months when he didnt work 
i was in trouble for a while williams says i borrowed 
money sold a house and i gambled i even dissolved investments to 
get some sort of cash going i was dipping from the well 
what saved him was that he got hungry for a career and realized 
he wasnt having one 
what i did was change my attitude he says i came to 
realize that refusing to audition was kind of an excuse for not 
really putting myself back on the line 
i decided i wouldnt use the brady bunch to work against me 
and i wouldnt use it to work for me i just had it as a credit one 
part of my career it was like starting over again 
the theater has given him employment during the lean years 
eventually he would love to do an action adventure television 
series 
im always looking for something else williams says when 
i have a steady job and im working then the business is fine but 
if im out of work for more than 10 days im already looking for 
something else to do 
the brady bunch may have left network television in the 
mid1970s but it lives on in rerun heaven the series is still 
televised by many local stations as well as by ted turners 
atlantabased superstation 
williams doesnt watch the old episodes 
its a little like home movies he says i know how they 
turn out 
the tv movie was a natural considering televisions insatiable 
appetite for nostalgia even for something that occurred as recently 
as 1974 but before williams agreed to do the movie he asked to see 
the script he liked what he read particularly the fact that greg 
was now grown up and responsible a doctor married and with a son 
williams filmed the christmas movie last summer along with most 
of the original cast members including florence henderson robert 
reed and ann b davis 
it was a good experience working with people i like a lot 
he says im glad were doing a reunion because it somehow sort of 
legitimizes all of those early years it almost makes them current 
i could go my whole life and never do another brady bunch 
episode and it would be ok because greg has a kid and hes a doctor 
and hes married it answers the question whatever happened to greg 
brady

quietly unobtrusively and with limited 
funds west germany has been buying back important artworks that 
left the country during the nazi era 
officials involved in the slow recovery of what germans call 
their wandered culture decline to say how much theyve spent to 
bring home some historically important works 
but at least 29 million is known to have been spent over the 
past five years in the effort the government has deliberately kept 
on a low key 
west germany struggles with a particularly acute problem of 
exiled art because of the volume of works sold during world war ii 
to help bankroll the nazi war effort 
thousands of paintings manuscripts sculptures and other 
cultural goods were salvaged from private collections or produced 
abroad by jews and intellectuals hounded from their homeland by 
adolf hitlers regime but only a fraction of the displaced art made 
its way back to germany after the war 
we have no defined plan for buying up all the important 
artworks that have wandered out of the country over the years but 
when the opportunity arises we make our best effort to get back what 
has been lost explained hans hieronymus who heads the interior 
ministrys office responsible for art acquisitions 
in an interview with the associated press hieronymus produced a 
list of the major works repatriated over the past few months they 
included three 16th century paintings by albrecht durer original 
compositions of richard wagner and robert schumann franz kafkas 
1920 manuscript of the trial and some personal letters and a 
1463 edition of the apocalypse one of the earliest products of 
johann gutenbergs blockprinting press 
the most stunning indication of west germanys commitment to 
restoration of germanys cultural heritage was the purchase five 
years ago of the gospel of henry the lionhearted a handwritten 
552page 12th century volume that has commanded the highest price 
to date for a book 188 million 
a government art appraiser hartmut vogel says the henry the 
lionhearted purchase was an inspiring success for west german art 
circles as it rewarded an unprecedented effort of cooperation among 
the sometimes fractious state and federal art dealers and private 
cultural foundations 
this was our masterpiece acquisition but for the most part our 
funds are too small to achieve much headway vogel told ap 
he alluded to the purchase in midnovember of the kafka 
manuscript by the state of badenwuerttemberg as a bargain at 198 
million but that kind of surprise acquisition is unlikely to be 
pulled off with any degree of frequency he conceded 
we have to be careful not to appear to be hunting dogs said 
verena tafel one of five art historians busy collecting works for 
west berlins museum of german history expected to open in the late 
1990s 
every national museum tries to repatriate those artworks that 
were lost during the nazi regime ms tafel said but being too 
aggressive can have the result of driving the prices up 
an official with the interior ministry who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said recovery of famous german works from 
abroad is an important facet of the governments acquisition policy 
but wed be stupid to publicly present this as a campaign 
he explained that a restrained profile in the international art 
market is essential in outbidding hesitant competitors and for west 
german buyers to put out the word that they are embarked on a 
repatriation project would serve only to price themselves out of the 
market 
ms tafel noted however that museum collectors have to maintain 
a delicate balance between discretion and enlisting popular support 
after learning of the west german governments plan to open a 
historical museum in west berlin she said the st louis science 
center this fall returned free of charge an early germanmade 
scientific model of the human body that had been taken out of the 
country during the nazi period 
earlier this year the us government agreed to return about 
6200 paintings and drawings from the nazi period that were 
confiscated at the end of world war ii the propaganda artworks 
commissioned by hitler to depict model soldiers and citizens are 
currently in storage at the bavarian army museum in ingolstadt 
pending official decisions on how they should be presented 
in cases where outright purchase is the only means of retrieving 
expatriated artworks or items of special interest for german 
museums west german buyers concede they are fighting a losing 
battle against wealthy japanese collectors and british and american 
curators with claims to significantly larger private funding sources 
sabine fehlemann director of the von der heydt museum in 
wuppertal traveled to london on nov 28 with authorization to bid 
as high as 58 million for pablo picassos the acrobat and the 
young harlequin the bidding was opened at 86 million and closed 
with the 386 million offer of tokyo collector akio nishino 
the 1905 masterpiece was a treasured possession of wuppertal 
until 1937 when nazi forces confiscated the painting declared it 
degenerate art and sold it to a swiss collector for 80000 swiss 
francs 
i thought we had little chance ms fehlemann said after the 
auction but i wanted to see our picasso just once more before it 
disappears into a japanese repository 
west german state collectors contend they enjoy fewer advantages 
in the international art arena than their competitors because of the 
dearth of private foundations to generate funds for public 
acquisitions 
the interior ministrys hieronymus explained that public 
offerings of important artworks often are advertised only a few 
weeks or days prior to the auction triggering a scramble for 
donations from each of the 10 west german states the federal 
government and the public foundations the cumbersome effort often 
serves to stall presentation of a reasonable bid he conceded 
increasingly priced out of the market for the bestknown works 
the state collectors have concentrated instead on preventing the 
further migration of german treasures 
under a 1955 law that charges the state with protecting national 
culture some 1000 artworks in west germany are designated by the 
government as national valuables restricting though not prohibiting 
their sale or exchange abroad 
we have to concentrate on preventing further losses ms 
tafel said 
in general if a famous german work of art is on public display 
in another country thats enough to make us happy she said 
were not like melina mercouri the former actress who is greeces 
culture minster we dont insist that everything must come back

until just a few years ago the gates of this 
old walled city were closed every night at 9 oclock as they had 
been for centuries in a country where slavery still existed 
strangers had to carry oil lanterns so that guards would not 
shoot them as intruders 
medicines radios schools eye glasses and even trousers were 
forbidden 
the country the size of new mexico and perched on the 
southeastern tip of the arabian peninsula was trapped in the middle 
ages by a despotic and eccentric sultan said bin taimur who sought 
to keep the 20th century at bay 
now with its oil wealth oman has been transformed into a modern 
state that has survived the traumas of the 8yearold iraniraq war 
at its doorstep 
the war has also heightened omans strategic importance as one of 
the guardians of the strait of hormuz the gateway to the persian 
gulf it shares control of the narrow waterway with iran 
the transition from the 16th century to the space age has taken 
oman the second largest country on the arabian peninsula after 
saudi arabia less than two decades 
oman was propelled through this time warp by sultan saids only 
son qaboos bin said who toppled his father in a bloodless coup at 
his palace in salalah in southern oman july 23 1970 
the old sultan was flown by britains royal air force to 
wellappointed exile in londons swank claridges hotel where he 
died two years later surrounded by the very modernity he had shut 
out since he took power in 1932 
qaboos who trained at britains sandhurst military academy and 
travelled throughout europe had been under virtual house arrest by 
his father for the previous three years in the belief he had been 
tainted by foreign influences 
although qaboos 48 opened up his country to the outside world 
it remains partially veiled its society still deeply rooted in 
traditional islamic values and customs 
omanis were among the first to embrace islam when it spread 
through the arabian peninsula in the 7th century 
qaboos is an absolute monarch who permits no elections or 
political parties a couple of years ago he formed a consultative 
assembly of appointed officials 
omanis are not allowed to marry foreigners if they marry abroad 
they cant bring their families home and they run the risk of 
losing their citizenship in the past many omani men sought foreign 
wives to avoid having to pay dowries traditional in the arab world 
in an effort to phase out what he has called the evil dowry 
system qaboos last year ruled that no man should pay more than 
2000 riyals 5180 for a bride he regularly exhorts sheiks and 
other leaders to curb the dowry system during his annual threeweek 
meetthepeople safaris around the country 
drinking in public is prohibited but foreigners and a growing 
number of younger omanis can imbibe freely in muscats hotels the 
penalties for drunkenness are severe however 
the news and journalists are restricted as they are in most arab 
countries 
despite its breathtaking 1800 miles of lagoonstudded arabian 
sea coastline tourists were kept out until a couple of years ago 
because they were seen as a potential threat to omans traditions 
commerce and industry minister salim bin abdullah alghazali 
noted in a recent report we dont want to see hippies with long 
hair and dirty jeans in any part of the sultanate we want 
tourists who are mature in both behavior and outlook 
despite the idiosyncracies of the old sultan said oman has a 
long history of contact with the outside world 
in the first millenium bc omani seafarers sailed with the 
monsoon winds to india and east africa in the 7th century omani 
traders were sailing as far as china in their oceangoing wooden 
dhows 
oman became a key trading center between the arabian hinterland 
and the orient 
the coming of steamships in the 1860s dealt a death blow to 
omans mercantile power it remained a key maritime and trading 
crossroads for a while but gradually slipped back into 
nearmedieval stagnation that ended only when qaboos took power 
on the steep jagged cliffs that form muscats natural harbor 
sailors who have dropped anchor over the centuries have carved or 
painted the names of their ships in big letters in the rock in a 
bizarre visitors book 
adm horatio nelson the victor of trafalgar was among the 
visitors when he was a lowly midshipman aboard a royal navy vessel 
a british official noted 
today qaboos gleaming alalam palace built in 1979 dominates 
the seafront at muscat which means anchorage old brass cannons 
on wooden carriages sit outside alongside modern antiaircraft 
guns on the seawall 
when qaboos seized power oman was wracked by an insurgency in 
southern dhofar province with british jordanian and iranian help 
he crushed that revolt which was backed by neighboring south yemen 
the only marxist country in the arab world 
with the oil discovered in 1964 although modest in volume 
compared to other persian gulf states qaboos launched his 
modernization program 
in sultan saids day there were only a few miles of paved road 
three religious schools 15 telephones two small hospitals no 
hotels and one small electricity generator in muscat installed in 
the late 1960s 
now oman has nearly 2000 miles of hardtop highways about 700 
schools technical colleges and a university with some 220000 
students 130 hospitals and clinics nearly 50000 telephones linked 
by satellite to the outside world and 24 power stations 
annual per capita income has soared from 400 to nearly 6000 
schools hospitals and other welfare programs are subsidised 
but a generation is growing up with no experience of the 
preqaboos era 
this has brought fears that young people will take todays 
benefits for granted raising expectations that may not be 
sustainable at present levels once omans oil runs out at the 
current production rate of 600000 barrels a day this is expected 
sometime in the next century 
no one under 20 can remember how bad things were before 1970 
said a westerner who has lived in oman for several years people 
have got used to the good things and unless that quality of life can 
be maintained theres some uncertainty about the future 
qaboos is trying to diversify the economy so hes not dependent 
on oil 
the fall in oil prices has slowed development but diplomats 
noted that major projects and the basic infrastructure were already 
completed before prices tumbled 
were concerned about oil prices but theres no use crying 
over spilt milk information minister abdul aziz bin mohammed 
rowes said but were cautiously optimistic that prices will 
recover weve lived without oil before and well just have to 
tighten our belts 
he added were proceeding with a policy of omanization 
gradually trimming the expatriates whove helped us develop the 
results so far are encouraging and we havent sacrificed 
performance were aiming for harmony

as mikhail s gorbachev maneuvers between 
conservatives and radicals to shake up the soviet government and 
economy chinas reform experience can serve as both an 
encouragement and a warning to him 
free markets private enterprise and incentives have tremendously 
stimulated chinas backward economy and for the most part ended food 
shortages also goals of president gorbachev 
but a decade into its economic reforms china faces its worst 
inflation in 30 years irrational growth patterns provinces and 
cities that ignore central directives and rampant black marketeering 
chinese leaders say they are at a turning point and that only if 
these problems are overcome can they proceed with more advanced 
reforms in prices wages and other areas 
although china and the soviet union have many differences 
experts from both countries say the chinese experience can yield 
lessons for gorbachev 
it is impossible for them the soviets to avoid all mistakes 
they can only hope to make fewer mistakes than china said liu 
qingjian an economist at chinas institute of soviet and east 
european studies 
china began its reforms in 1978 when the thricepurged 
revolutionary veteran deng xiaoping gained control of the communist 
party following the death in 1976 of chairman mao tsetung 
deng focused on reorganizing the economy breaking up communes 
in favor of family farming decontrolling some prices and giving 
staterun factories greater autonomy 
only in 1987 did china begin systematic government reorganization 
and make limited concessions to democracy such as multicandidate 
balloting in partycontrolled elections political discussion 
remained tightly limited 
gorbachev who rose to power on the death of president leonid i 
brezhnev in 1985 took the opposite approach unlike china where 
the political and economic chaos of the 196676 cultural revolution 
left many people open to change the soviet union presented him with 
a suspicious public as well as strong political opposition 
gorbachevs method has been to open soviet society to 
unprecedented frank criticism of the status quo while proposing 
constitutional changes in the presidency and parliament that would 
strengthen his hand against opponents 
but soviet experts at chinas institute of soviet and east 
european studies maintained in recent interviews that gorbachevs 
glasnost or openness has succeeded in enthusing only a handful of 
intellectuals 
to win over ordinary soviets they said gorbachev must take a 
leaf from dengs book and offer tangible benefits 
most of gorbachevs economic proposals including leasing farm 
land to families and giving factories more autonomy have been given 
only limited trials 
theres too much talking and too little action said 
economist liu 
free markets at the heart of chinas new prosperity are 
smallscale and expensive for consumers in the soviet union 
a shopper in a typical chinese city can choose from dozens of 
small vendors private and staterun in buying a wide array of 
fresh fruit and vegetables soviet shoppers often wait in long lines 
for scant selections 
if gorbachev cannot improve the wellbeing of the soviet people 
his position and his reforms will be weakened said political 
scientist zhu ruizhen 
deng tackled his reforms in one area at a time he waited until 
the breakup of communes had been justified by several good harvests 
before making changes in the industrial sector 
but anton vassiliev an economist and first secretary at the 
soviet embassy in beijing said this piecemeal approach has caused 
many of chinas current economic problems 
this is perhaps one of the important experiences of the chinese 
reform that reform will bring results only if the concrete steps 
in different fields are interrelated vassiliev said 
for example chinese factory owners buy most of their raw 
materials at prices set by supply and demand but face state 
ceilings when they sell their products they have authority to hire 
and fire but only the most rudimentary of labor markets exists 
dozens of chinese provincial and city governments have been 
authorized to borrow money for capital construction projects but 
bankers have no corresponding power to regulate credit 
market confusion flourishing black markets and steadily rising 
inflation now officially pegged at 26 percent are among the 
results 
vassiliev said moscow has put greater emphasis on planning 
coordinated change in various sectors 
china also offers a lesson in the dangers of decentralizing too 
much he said 
cities and provinces given special economic autonomy have 
developed rapidly but they also have duplicated projects 
unnecessarily and competed for scarce raw materials fueling 
inflation 
when chinese leaders this fall ordered a slowdown to curb 
inflation many local governments ignored the order 
in agriculture too china may have decentralized too much 
family farming has been popular but it has hampered the introduction 
of machines and hightech methods needed to increase yields 
the soviet union has no comparable special economic zones 
although some economists have proposed them however gorbachev has 
already witnessed reforms splintering effects as nationalists in 
the soviet baltic states have taken advantage of glasnost to press 
for political autonomy 
chinas soviet experts said the turmoil created by gorbachevs 
political restructuring reveals a volatility in the soviet 
population that may make later economic reforms much more difficult 
than in china 
the chinese people are more obedient said political 
scientist wang qi if the soviet union were experiencing the 
economic problems china has now there would be riots 
both countries have a stake in each others reforms 
chinese intellectuals hope that if gorbachevs political reforms 
work it will give a push to promoters of glasnost in china 
if chinas economic programs succeed said vassiliev it will 
generally show that socialism does have potential for development 
and that the problems that exist now in soviet society can be 
solved

bartenders mix a tequila sunrise from tequila lime juice 
grenadine orange juice and ice cubes the drink possesses quite a 
kick 
writerdirector robert towne concocted tequila sunrise out of 
three highpowered stars a romantic triangle lush los angeles 
settings and copversusdrug dealers intrigue the result is 
surprisingly flat 
the movie opens with mel gibson escaping from a police trap 
during a drug transaction in an east side motel gibson has a 
drugdealing past but he claims to have been an innocent 
participant in the motel deal innocent and insists hes retired 
from the business 
his old high school and surfing buddy kurt russell doesnt 
think so russell is a narcotics cop and hell nail gibson any way 
he can that includes luring into bed michelle pfeiffer a 
restaurant owner he suspects is involved professionally and 
personally with gibson 
gibsons former associates dont want him to quit especially the 
bigtime operator from mexico raul julia posing as a top government 
crime fighter gibson finds himself besieged by the ruthless julia 
on one side and russell as well as unprincipled federal agents on 
the other in the meantime he manages to conduct his own romance 
with pfeiffer 
tequila sunrise is a curiosity an action adventure without 
action except from the opening chase and the final waterfront 
shootout its mostly talk lots of soulsearching philosophizing 
hunting for motives director towne seems to be overwhelmed by 
writer townes words the audience is not 
the actors do their best with muddled characterizations gibson 
remains the most watchable of young leading men but he needs help 
from a workable script russell almost unrecognizable with his hair 
slicked back does nicely as the unscrupulous cop pfeiffer is 
gorgeous as ever 
the ethics of tequila sunrise are questionable the 
attractive gibson is the sympathetic figure and he exhibits no 
remorse for helping to ruin lives by hustling dope is such a 
portrayal acceptable in a just say no society 
thom mount was producer of the warner bros release which is 
rated r for language drug use and sexual content running time 116 
minutes 
a final word about the title it appears to have nothing to do 
with the movie except that in one brief scene gibson is seen with 
an orangeylooking drink in his hand

videos reviewed this week stand and deliver vampire at 
midnight bad dreams call me 
 
stand and deliver warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg 
 
the first thing one needs to know about stand and deliver is 
that it is a true story because if one didnt know in advance that 
it really happened some of the events in this film might be hard to 
swallow 
the setting is garfield high a school in poor and heavily 
hispanic east los angeles on the brink of losing its academic 
accreditation jaime escalante edward james olmos shows up one day 
as the new computer science teacher he is told the computers never 
arrived and is shunted off to teach basic math 
undaunted escalante walks into the classroom and announces to 
the unruly and apathetic students knowing math will only get you 
a job at a taco stand i will teach you algebra and so he does 
cajoling badgering bullying humoring escalante gives these 
11thgraders many of whom dont even know their multiplication 
tables a reason to try harder 
and harder and harder because as soon as he teaches them 
algebra escalante decides he wants to teach them calculus in their 
senior year with calculus he tells his incredulous colleagues 
they will be able to take the advanced math placement test and gain 
college credit its a ticket to scholarships to a world heretofore 
unattainable to these barrio kids 
the 18 students take the rigorous course and pass the advanced 
placement test with flying colors and heres where the movie gets 
really interesting the educational testing service decides that 
the scores are so high that the students must have cheated and 
invalidates them as escalante says the world that the students 
have worked so hard to become a part of turns out to be not worthy 
of them the students decide to take the test again to stand and 
deliver 
olmos gives a riveting performance as the dogged escalante a 
mumbling funny believably rumpled teacher kudos to the casting 
directors who chose the balding acnescarred olmos over a flashier 
screenidol type of the students the only actor with name 
recognition is la bamba star lou diamond phillips who plays a 
hood afraid to look too brainy 
the film was directed by ramon menendez who cowrote the 
screenplay with producer tom musca although simplistic at times 
stand and deliver should be heralded for letting the story line 
stand and deliver and not succumb to schmaltz

anna works for a downtown newspaper similar to the village voice

the brutal slaying of a transvestite by a vicious crooked cop 
from here on the movie adapts a lackluster thriller mode with a 
stop or two at erotica of special note to citrus fans anna does 
curious things with an orange 
patricia charbonneau who gave a nice offbeat performance as the 
lesbian in desert hearts is rather limp here but that probably 
has more to do with the script by karen kay and sollace mitchell

every dog has his day irs lets active 
 
we promise mitch if you go back to doing what you do best 
well never use the word jangly in a lets active review again 
much to mitch easters chagrin his band has always been lumped 
with the jangly guitar groups that followed in the wake of 
underground faves rem easter who produced rems first few 
albums has tried to carve an identity for his own band since its 
bright tuneful debut in 1983 
unfortunately hes done it lately by turning lets active into 
lead active the selfconscious effort at hardening the bands sound 
turns the promising every dog has his day into a disappointment 
its not that lets active cant rock out the title tune is 
quite successful its just that easters highpitched nasal voice 
and intriguing melodic sense tends to drown in a sea of metallic 
shards most of the hard rockers here such as the thrashing ten 
layers down or too bad are simply uninteresting 
the albums two best songs are comparatively quiet and performed 
by guitarist angie carlson mr fool is intricately beautiful 
and forty years shows a country flavor by this north carolina 
band 
easter seems intent on erasing an image problem in his mind and 
hes succeeded 
but at what cost

pattern disruptive epic the dickey betts band 
 
pattern disruptive features the first new music from former 
allman brothers guitarist dickey betts since 1981 its remarkable 
then that the record contains not one fresh idea betts clings to 
the 1970s southern rock formula with a passion that alas is 
missing from his singing and playing 
the one cut that makes pattern disruptive worth hearing is 
the instrumental duanes tune the flashy guitar work and a 
complex melody make for a quick six minutes of music the tune is up 
to the standards of such allman brothers instrumentals as 
jessica and in memory of elizabeth reed which betts also 
wrote 
much of the rest of the album is pale blues betts and fellow 
guitarist warren haynes offer a few lively breaks usually in 
tandem but a lot of their riffs are as hackneyed as heavy metal 
and the singers and rhythm section sound as bored by the material as 
the audience is sure to be 
next time betts should try an album of instrumentals at least 
that formula is a winner

buenos noches from a lonely room reprise dwight yoakam 
 
yeah i know a lot of people dont seem to like dwight yoakam 
he has that nasal twang he wears silly skintight pants and his 
selfproclaimed hillbilly music seems a mite contrived to some 
people 
yoakams first two albums may be partly to blame guitars 
cadillacs etc and hillbilly deluxe were promising after 
all no one had heard much like this lately but he still sounded 
calculating as well as creative 
but not here no sir buenos noches from a lonely room is a 
genuinely brilliant record 11 songs that sound like dwight yoakam 
sat down and invented country music all by himself 
he didnt of course yoakam is well aware of where he comes 
from and he again pays homage to old masters his anthemic 
rendition of the buck owens classic streets of bakersfield a 
duet with owens himself is the finest track on the album a 
rousing fullthrottle synopsis of what country music is all about 
and the rest of buenos noches is fine as well from the 
funereal i sang dixie one of seven yoakam originals here to 
the semiobscure johnny cash cover home of the blues and a 
pretty duet with lone justices maria mckee on roy acuffs send me 
the pillow 
with this album dwight yoakam has hit his stride his singing 
fluid and powerful his sound his own forget the permanent scowl 
and the silly pants this is great stuff this is for real

when the history of american entertainment in 
the 1970s and 80s is written a hefty chapter will be required for 
saturday night live 
nbcs offthewall comedy series has produced almost as many 
stars as did vaudeville in an earlier era including john belushi 
chevy chase dan aykroyd bill murray gilda radner jane curtin 
albert brooks laraine newman joe piscopo eddie murphy brad hall 
jim belushi billy crystal christopher guest rich hall and martin 
short 
murray has warm memories of his service 197780 with the not 
ready for prime time players 
the most fun we had was when it was just us after 6 oclock on 
friday night everyone would leave the building rca in rockefeller 
plaza new york we wouldnt have hangerson or guests or visitors 
it would just be the actors and the crew 
that was fun that nobody else could have he said were 
the only ones who know what it was really like from 6 oclock to 11 
oclock it was just work execution and learning something it was 
one of the greatest schools anyone could ever have anyone who had 
that job for more than six months can do anything it was incredible 
training 
we all got goofy but everybody gets goofy we were in the 
business of making funny television hopefully when you did it 
right that was more satisfying that getting drunk or throwing 
bottles out of windows or whatever anyone says we may have done 
many of the tricks murray learned on saturday night live can 
be viewed in scrooged new from paramount pictures its an 
update of a christmas carol with murray as a tv network boss who 
would make scrooge seem like mother teresa most of the critics 
didnt enjoy the movie but the public did the first weekend take 
was a massive 13 million on 1262 screens 
why another version of dickens ofttold tale 
the incentive was to make a funny version of a christmas 
carol to give it a modern look and a 1980s social conscience 
murray said besides i wanted to work i like to work im a 
better person when i work it was better that i get a job i was 
deteriorating rapidly 
of course one never knows how seriously to take murrays 
remarks it is true that he took a long breather after the megahit 
ghostbusters and his dramatic mishap the razors edge 
what did he do on his vacation 
well i was over in paris for a while he said i studied a 
little bit at the sorbonne i learned how to eat with a fork and 
knife theyre really very good with a fork and knife over there in 
france they can eat anything with a knife and fork they prefer to 
eat yogurt with a knife and fork 
theyre much better than the english or the dutch with 
silverware every american should go to france to learn how to use 
silverware theyve got something going there i dont think even 
the french know what theyve got 
the silverware thing is pretty much it for my vacation he 
quipped there werent any good scripts they were all pretty 
scary you get lazy your momentum drops and you get so you can 
barely leave the house 
you get lazier and lazier when i did scrooged it took me 
weeks to get back into it i wasnt really sharp at all usually 
just before lunch theres a big shot and they like to get it for 
two or three weeks i blew the take just before lunch and they said 
thats ok bill lets go eat maybe that will help i wasnt 
amusing anybody for a weeks 
murray grew up in a funny family in wilmette ill near chicago 
he was the middle of nine children who according to family legend 
vied for the attention of their father a lumber salesman with a 
rare sense of humor he continued trying to make his fellow students 
laugh while attending a jesuit school after a brief stint at a 
premed school in denver he drifted back to chicago 
his older brother brian had joined second city the 
improvisational comedy troupe that included john belushi and harold 
ramis murray studied at the companys workshop then replaced 
belushi who moved on to new york the murray brothers and ramis 
followed soon afterward then came the explosion of saturday night 
live 
murrays fresh laidback comedic style attracted movie interest 
and his first starring role was in ivan reitmans summercamp 
comedy meatballs he bombed in where the buffalo roam a 
mistaken attempt to capture gonzo journalist hunter s thompson in a 
movie then came another reitman romp stripes followed by 
ghostbusters 
in 1989 the ghostbuster gang returns for the longawaited 
sequel 
ghostbusters was the most fun we ever had making a movie 
said murray it was just funny people doing a funny movie even 
though there was a lot of waiting because of the special effects we 
really had a lot of fun ive known these guys aykroyd ramis 
reitman for a long time we laughed a lot

the day before vladimir horowitz performed in 
moscow two years ago philipp viardo played the middle movement of a 
mozart sonata as a sound check for the tv cameras 
after the concert vladimir and natalia viardo were introduced to 
horowitz as the parents of philipp who was then 9 
but for everybody else vladimir viardo is a symbol of 
glasnost hes the first soviet musician to receive permission 
to live in the united states to have his family join him and to 
retain his soviet citizenship 
at 23 viardo won the 1973 van cliburn international piano 
competition in fort worth the only russian who has won it he 
toured with much acclaim in the united states and mexico in 1974 
and 75 then wasnt allowed to return until 1988 he now has been 
given permission to live in texas and pursue his career for two 
years natalia viardo a former teacher was to bring back sons 
philipp 11 and alexander 4 this month 
the soviet concert bureau already had fixed about 25 appearances 
for the 39yearold viardo ten us solo recitals are scheduled for 
april 
the next year is completely free i hope it will be full i 
want to compensate he said 
he said the desire to stay in the united states came in a flash 
i was driving in a car with a friend in texas i thought im 
missing a chance to play concerts meet people attend concerts 
why should i 
viardo said the reason he can stay is glasnost it also is 
timing when pianist vladimir feltsman received permission to leave 
the soviet union last year viardo said feltsman stayed two months 
applying for an open visa that would allow him to return when that 
was denied he left and now lives with his wife and son in new york 
he didnt want to leave forever russian nostalgia is a very 
famous thing viardo said 
after deciding he wanted to stay here viardo wrote a letter 
explaining the practical and creative music reasons to the 
soviet ambassador in washington after three very nervous weeks 
the viardos were invited to talk with the soviet consul general in 
new york three weeks later he called them in again and said moscow 
had given the green light 
he has seven bloods including jewish gypsy russian and 
polish its borscht viardo says and his wife whose brother 
lives in chicago is jewish 
viardo thought about leaving the soviet union forever during the 
13 years he wasnt allowed to visit the united states i couldnt 
i had a strong connection with my teachers and friends he said 
i was bitter there was psychological torture this is the age 
when i had to establish myself it was very important in my life 
he said that his touring to the west just stopped without any 
explanation i dont know what ive done maybe once somebody didnt 
like my face 
asked if he was treated fairly in those 13 years he said i 
dont connect too much musical things to money certainly they paid 
me for concerts if you consider salary for workers i was paid 
more if you consider people who came abroad it was much less 
i was allowed to play big halls and with any orchestra i 
learned my repertoire from six concertos to 35 
it is miraculous i was not broken down psychologically in those 
years he said in the russian language musician means executor 
somebody else creates the music and we execute it it puts in the 
minds of officials we are not creative 
viardo was allowed to give concerts only inside the soviet union 
from 1976 to 80 for the next seven years he could perform also in 
eastern europe in 1987 france germany and denmark were added and 
in 1988 america 
viardo hasnt yet decided what hell play in his upcoming us 
concerts 
as a grownup artist i have a taste to play one name an 
allchopin recital he said as a very young pianist for the 
united states i must show i can play different styles i want to 
show something like some shostakovich which was never played in this 
country 
his new position may put pressure on him but viardo said hes 
ready 
i dont make political noise to bring attention to me because 
i think it is not very good for a musician i believe it should be 
strictly music he said 
but he sees classical music as softening spirits in a political 
world 
in 1974 after some concert somebody came to me and said i 
cannot shoot in such a world like you if i play well and soften 
his heart he cannot shoot at me it really can work in a political 
way

robbie nevil held a up picture of himself smiled 
and said nice guy real down to earth 
but nevil who made his mark on the music business in 1986 with 
cest la vie seems ready to take off at any moment 
theres an energy that comes across i do love it said 
nevil who has released his second album a place like this 
i like to do what i do for a living how many people can say 
that 
nevil recently talked about his career in a recent interview at 
offices of his record label emi he is animated in conversation 
peppering his observations with renditions of songs and doing an 
inspired impersonation of his idol stevie wonder 
i dont take myself too seriously he said i dont think 
im better or worse than anybody else really i like music and play 
guitar ive been very lucky and im making the music i want without 
compromising on any level 
im having a good time 
nevil grew up in los angeles in the 1970s show business was in 
his blood 
my mom used to play classical piano my father was a child 
actor he was junior on the dick tracy radio show my younger 
brothers an actor 
so nevil didnt take long to decide he wanted to be a musician 
maybe not when i was five but by the time i was 11 i started 
to play guitar he said from that point i started working at 
it i believe in getting good at what i do a lot of people are 
better than me but that makes you push harder i believe in setting 
my goals high 
nevil also began singing early i remember singing in grade 
school i used to love singing loud that feeling of power this 
principal heard me sing she just picked me out and at graduation i 
sang lavender blue 
he worked at a stationery store and then a delicatessen but he 
kept on writing songs and five years ago composed cest la vie 
he had no idea it would be such a major hit 
i wasnt thinking that was the first single but everybody 
seemed to react to that its strong immediate and fun the sound 
had its own distinct style 
despite the success of cest la vie he decided not to tour 
in support of his selftitled debut album i had to go to japan 
many times for promotion you cant really do that if youre on the 
road 
but now hes anxious to play live 
i want to get a chance to get to know the fans said nevil 
who will start touring in march this time even though im more 
than a name i want to start small just nightclub gigs 
nevil admits to having some jitters about touring but considers 
that an asset 
its a healthy nervous about wanting to make it good to have 
the best players so i can have fun with it he said i think 
people are going to see the show and get a sense of the band george 
michael tends to be more of a solo artist and the band backs him 
up 
michaels name popped up frequently not only does nevil admire 
his singing but michaels producer chris porter worked 
extensively on a place like this 
his attitude was so great he didnt just say i do this if 
i had to go into a studio and make a record with no effects id 
choose him he doesnt need the effects that a lot of new cats need 
their stuff is great but without processing theyd be lost 
nevil confesses to a little processing himself but says that a 
place like this is a fairly simple production 
i used punchedin vocals on the first album but this album has 
a lot less going on i went for more performance he said i 
loved the last album but this album is a new face here i am if 
you like it if you dont well this is what i do 
and what he does sells nevil is well informed on how to write 
hits and talked about back on holiday his new single 
i think it was a good choice for a first single because it was 
very sonically hardhitting it doesnt take long to get to the 
point its not the kind of song you have to hear five times 
does nevil really think about writing hit singles 
i think to say no would be a lie he said if i have a 
groove and its catchy id be a fool to write something weird in 
the middle i like to think what makes it feel good i think of it 
as a single in wanting to make sure its watertight

the truth about lorin jones is that the late 
artist refuses to fit the feminist pigeonhole into which polly alter 
tries to wedge her 
the truth about alison lurie the author of the truth about 
lorin jones is that she resists pigeonholing just as formidably 
the truth about lorin jones 1895 little brown the 
pulitzer prizewinning authors eighth novel is about the vagaries 
of researching a biography the hypocisy of certain types of 
feminism and the tenacity of one polly alter luries protagonist 
this charming book borrows a little from the detective genre and a 
lot from gentle satire 
polly a bornagain feminist whose marriage has just dissolved 
decides to write the biography of lorin jones an artist who made a 
big splash in the 1950s but died a virtual unknown in 1969 polly 
an art historian has made up her mind before she begins the project 
that the men in lorin jones life destroyed her but her perception 
of the elusive artist shifts with every interview lorin jones 
halfbrother art dealer husband last lover all tell conflicting 
tales all of course paint themselves in the most flattering light 
while castigating the others 
as polly tries to ferret out the truth her personal life is 
turned upside down by a lesbian experiment with her roommate 
between the two experiences writing the biography and negotiating 
with her roommate and her roommates other lover she learns that 
men are not all bad and women are not all good 
in a recent interview in new york lurie was asked where she got 
the idea for polly alter 
shes based on a lot of people ive known former students 
young faculty the author said the problems the concerns of 
women of that generation are very different from the concerns of 
women of my generation polly is in her 30s lurie is 62 
she represents women who have grown up into feminism i 
know women who have had a bad experience with a man who come to me 
and say i wish i was a lesbian my best friends are all women i 
trust them and understand them the problem is im just not 
physically attracted to them some of them will try to become 
lesbians but theres a very small proportion of women to which 
lesbianism is natural 
lurie herself a feminist is aware that some feminists may 
object to the unflattering portraits of many of the female 
characters has there been a feminist backlash 
i havent had any feminists say you are a bad guy and i spit 
upon you or even milder versions of that but i have begun to 
have communications from men who are let us say very suspicious of 
feminism uncomfortable with it who are congratulating me and it 
makes me feel that i havent made myself clear that my sympathy 
for jeanne or even betsy that poor girl pollys lesbian roommate 
and her lover hasnt come over the author said 
lurie is a longtime resident of ithaca ny where she teaches 
writing folklore and childrens literature at cornell university 
she teaches only during the fall and spends the rest of the year 
writing fiction dividing her time between upstate new york key 
west fla and london 
the writer first made a name for herself with her fourth novel 
the war between the tates published in 1974 she won a pulitzer 
a decade later with foreign affairs 
but just as the fictional lorin jones resists easy typecasting 
so does her creator lurie was asked if she is happy with critics 
label of her as a satirical writer 
oh you know people are going to label you she said if i 
wasnt a satirical writer id be a sensational writer or a 
romantic writer 
well then would she rather be wry and amusing or known for 
your mordant wit 
i think in this society women are expected to be sweeter and 
nicer than men and i think if i were a man and had written these 
books people wouldnt be making so much of my mordant wit men are 
expected to take a cooler look at the world she said 
she also balked at reviews that hailed her as a modernday henry 
james or edith wharton after the publication of foreign affairs 
ive been compared to james because i wrote about americans in 
europe foreign affairs she said a critic is always going 
to make parallels 
since she does not write while teaching she is not working on 
any novels now 
if i thought about it too much i would become impatient and 
when i saw a stack of papers to grade i would feel interrupted so 
i try to put it aside she said sometimes it works better the 
work goes on underground even when youre not thinking about it

the banjo an instrument that traveled to 
america with african slaves has captured the imagination of pickers 
with dozens of playing styles who perform almost every type of music 
somebody whos a nonbanjo player might think all banjo playing 
is alike said art rosenbaum who researches banjo music but 
theres so much way to express your individuality through banjo 
banjo performers today range from snuffy jenkins who learned his 
threefinger picking style in the 1920s to tony trischka who has 
teamed the banjo with symphony orchestras and electronic 
synthesizers 
elements of bluegrass are combined with rock n roll jazz and 
classical music on the three albums by trischka he has performed in 
tuxedo with a symphony orchestra 
a lot of people were kind of like bent out of shape about it 
they said you cant do that with the banjo i just want to get 
into as much of the banjo as i can explore trischka said 
the instrument itself has evolved and playing styles have 
evolved said rosenbaum a picker who has uses his research on the 
instrument and folk traditions in radio shows and books rosenbaum 
joined more than 150 other players at a series of workshops in 
lebanon this fall 
the first banjos were crafted from gourds in africa he said 
later in america they were made with a wooden frame and animal hide 
stretched across the head 
they used to be made of cat skin in the old days and they used 
catgut for strings rosenbaum said they say that when someone 
wanted a banjo they would just go out and kill a cat and in two 
hours they would be playing a tune on it 
some of the earliest banjo performances were 19th century 
minstrel shows where white performers mimicked the banjo playing of 
blacks and painted their faces with black makeup 
some people still play in the tradition of the minstrels and 
from that style grew the classic banjo practiced today by british 
recording artist chris sands and others sands plays ragtime and 
also arranges the music of bach handel and chopin for the banjo 
a friend of mine says nothing ever disappears i guess 
thats kind of true with the banjo rosenbaum said 
oldtime banjo playing remains popular including the 
clawhammer style a rhythmic method of striking downward on the 
strings that was revived during the folk craze of the 60s he said 
todays bluegrass relies heavily on threefinger picking made 
famous in the 50s by the father of bluegrass banjo earl scruggs 
as a member of the foggy mountain boys 
scruggs style evolved from threefinger picking first put on the 
radio by jenkins in 1934 jenkins continues to perform the folk 
tunes he learned as a boy although he says playing is more 
difficult at age 80 
i cant feel the strings anymore he said it makes my 
heart sick at my stomach to see other guys picking and want to but i 
cant 
jenkins says he didnt invent threefinger picking and he 
doesnt consider himself a bluegrass player i dont claim to be a 
bluegrass picker because that term came out after me and im too 
old to change i dont think its bluegrass that different its 
just the oldtime music speeded up 
traditional bluegrass epitomized by the foggy mountain boys 
tune foggy mountain breakdown and often thought of as 
hillbilly music is by far the most popular banjo style said janet 
deering coowner of deering banjo co in lemon grove calif 
only about 10 percent of us banjo pickers play the fourstring 
banjos used primarily for dixieland jazz she said most banjos have 
five strings 
deering estimates that about 2000 banjos costing from 500 to 
thousands of dollars are made in the united states each year 
hundreds more mostly less expensive are imported 
no statistics on the number of banjos or banjo players are kept 
she said 
i would guess compared to guitar players youd have one banjo 
player to every 100 guitar players deering said but there are 
millions playing the guitar 
a growing number of musicians are experimenting with new 
directions for the banjo and deerings company began making an 
electric banjo about 1 years ago and 100 have been sold

lionel aldridge a 6foot4 225pound former 
green bay packer was afraid to go home he believed his wife was a 
witch 
once part of nbcs television sportscasting team aldridge was 
driven from job to job in city after city by imaginary voices he 
now sorts mail on the 330 pm to midnight shift in milwaukee 
schizophrenia cost him a career a marriage and just about 
every person i had in my life at that time 
i figure he said recently it cost me everything 
such are the stakes in schizophrenia 
thats why research advances such as the recent evidence that a 
single gene may cause some cases are more than just nifty bits of 
science they are another step in understanding a devastating 
disease that strikes perhaps one in every 100 people at some point 
in their lives 
schizophrenia usually begins with an apparent personality change 
that may include social withdrawal difficulty in communicating and 
lethargy later in its more active phase it can make victims see 
hallucinations and hear voices 
they may feel controlled by invisible agents or believe their 
thoughts are being broadcast to others they may adopt new 
identities 
nobody knows what causes the disease a key question in finding 
better treatments aldridge said the gene discovery is just the 
tip of the iceberg toward finding a cause 
scientists have long suspected an inherited influence and the 
new study provided biological evidence for a gene in a few families 
but that gene has been shown not to be a factor in other families 
supporting the longstanding suspicion of multiple factors perhaps 
environmental and genetic 
the voices and hallucinations are gone now for aldridge 47 
thanks to daily medication that keeps his illness at bay im 
enjoying relatively good health now he said but nothing is 
guaranteed me for the future 
for the louisiana native the schizophrenia battle began after 
his athletic career he played defensive end for the packers and was 
part of the most famous defensive line in national football league 
history when the team won three straight nfl championships and the 
first two super bowls 
he was traded to the san diego chargers in 1971 and retired from 
pro ball after two seasons taking up radio and tv sportscasting in 
milwaukee nbc used him as an analyst for several seasons including 
its 1977 super bowl coverage 
but the first signs of trouble had already appeared in early 
1974 he had trouble concentrating he couldnt get his work done on 
time and as a result his broadcasts often ran shorter than planned 
i became very suspicious of people especially the people i 
worked with the workplace became very difficult a very unhappy 
place 
aldridge sought psychotherapy but later that year he began to 
have bouts of psychosis with imaginary voices and hallucinations 
it was like suddenly discovering another world one that had 
been here all along one that was totally foreign and frightening 
while his behavior on the air appeared normal his life at other 
times was bizarre he feared that his wife was a witch he ran 
barefoot through the snow in search of his therapist 
soon he was hospitalized i knew i needed help he said but 
the medication he received for a couple years zombied me out so 
bad i couldnt work he had to work so he gave up the medication 
he continued to fight the voices that told him to quit his job 
and leave town and that nobody liked him he battled the delusions 
that the station was underground that he had to hide from others 
and watch out for himself 
that was the existence i chose because i wouldnt take the 
medication because i figured i could take care of myself 
in 1981 he took a leave of absence from his job i simply could 
not do it any more he said his wife had already filed for 
divorce 
he left milwaukee and traveled the country for as long as his 
money held out then he sold the car and continued by bus and train 
within a few months of leaving town he was living on the streets 
but he found some respectable jobs sports director at a 
louisiana radio station prison counselor football coach at a high 
school and a college 
i could keep myself straight during the interview he 
recalled and when the employers found out who he was they were 
happy to hire him 
but the voices wouldnt let me stay anyplace for any length 
of time he said one by one he left his jobs or was let go 
in 1984 he found himself back in a milwaukee hospital thanks to 
friends alarmed by his behavior the doctors talked about medicine 
again and aldridge figured he would give it a try i had nothing 
to stay straight for on the outside so being zombied out 
would not be a problem he reasoned 
so it went for about three months but then his doctor cut the 
dose until aldridge was taking just enough medication to keep the 
voices and hallucinations away while avoiding the side effect 
in late 1984 he left the hospital for a nursing home then went 
on to his own apartment he started work at the post office in 1985 
and apart from a brief interruption he has been there since now 
aldridge speaks publicly about schizophrenia hoping to encourage 
research he was recently honored for his efforts by the national 
mental health association 
looking back at what schizophrenia cost him he said im 
trying to find out what good it brought 
it brought me the ability to travel around the country and talk 
to people about it it made me stronger in some ways 
it made me comfortable in situations where i was uncomfortable 
before i cant think of any situation where i can be intimidated 
because the worst has already happened how much more can you lose 
than everything

leon johnson had a bruised chest when he went 
to see the doctor but waiting two hours for treatment made him sick 
to his stomach 
i finally did get treated by the doctor but i was so upset by 
the time he was through i didnt care whether it hurt or not i just 
told him off said johnson 74 of oakhurst calif 
he was too busy for me and i didnt need his services that bad 
it is particularly frustrating to some of us senior citizens who 
dont have that much time left to wait 
in the face of increasing competition some doctors and dentists 
are becoming more concerned about timeconscious patients like 
johnson and are taking a cue from harddriving executives on how to 
manage time

mothers of babies with severe head and 
facial deformities cuddle and smile at them less than those with 
normal infants but claim greater satisfaction from parenthood a 
new study suggests 
the researchers made 18minute videotapes of 10 mothers and their 
4monthold babies five of whom were normal and five of whom 
suffered from disorders producing serious deformities but no 
neurological or mental deficiencies the infants were matched in 
terms of age sex birth order all firstborn ethnic status and 
the mothers age marital status and education 
the sessions included 10 minutes of play five minutes in which 
the mothers tried to get their babies to vocalize and three minutes 
of babies facetoface with their mothers who had to imitate the 
babies expressions and actions 
mothers of deformed babies touched them a fifth as much as 
mothers of normal infants spent a third as much time demonstrating 
toys to them and smiled or laughed at them half has much said r 
christopher barden a university of utah psychologist who directed 
the study 
in turn the deformed infants touched their mothers and smiled or 
laughed at them a fourth as much as the normal babies cried more 
than twice as much and responded to their mothers voice a fifth as 
much barden found 
the mothers of deformed children however claimed greater 
satisfaction with parenthood suggesting they are either unwilling 
to admit or unaware of the difficulties and stress imposed by their 
deformed child he said 
braden collaborated with martin e ford of stanford university 
and kenneth salyer marcy rogerssalyer and gayle jensen of the

wildlife researchers are turning to 
relatives of blackfooted ferrets to develop a vaccine against 
canine distemper which led to the removal of the last known north 
american ferrets from the wild 
the problem that we have is that on canine distemper for dogs 
and cats a vet will give those animals a live vaccine said art 
reese wyoming game and fish department chief of habitat and 
technical services you cant do that with a ferret we tried that 
with the first ones and it killed them 
biologists using siberian fitch and domestic ferrets have 
succeeded only in developing a threemonth inoculation reese said 
in a lab setting that would be all right but in the wild it isnt 
worth a darn 
since the ferrets were taken from their colony in 1985 
researchers have bred 58 in captivity six kits went in october to 
the national zoo and eight go to the henry doorley zoo in omaha 
neb this month for breeding 
using five breeding facilities around the country to bolster the 
genetic makeup of breeding populations reese said experts hope by 
fiscal 1991 to have 50 ferrets enough to return some to the high 
plains desert around meeteetse the next year they hope to begin 
reintroduction in other states including montana colorado idaho 
utah and nebraska 
the department is building prairie dog towns that will be used to 
train the laboratorybred ferrets reese said the ferrets will 
essentially be trained in prairie dog towns to hunt prairie dogs and 
interact similarly to an environment in which theyre going to be 
placed

the biggest population of voles in 30 
years is playing havoc with the fragile rocky mountain tundra as the 
thumbsized rodents chew their way through grass and leave areas 
open to erosion 
they have altered the highcountry growth as profoundly as fire 
changed yellowstone scientists say its just far greater than 
anything we have ever guessed at said university of colorado 
researcher norm french 
there may be 25 times more voles this year than at the low point 
of their 30year population cycle said researcher jim halfpenny 
their kin the arctic lemmings are famous for extreme population 
fluctuations 
it could make major changes not only in vegetation but changes 
in animal communities up there and when you consider this is front 
rangewide it could be a major event in a significant part of the 
rocky mountains french said 
outbreaks have been found in montana and wyoming and denverarea 
residents have reported volechewed lawns the vole explosion could 
have a serious impact on the food supply of the pica another small 
tundra rodent he said 
but halfpenny doesnt see the chewed terrain as damaged the 
tundra you see now is already a product of voles he said weve 
been looking at the picture for ages and this year were learning 
how the picture was made

the governments only official earthquake 
prediction of a moderate central california jolt by 1993 is 
being challenged by research indicating it could be much stronger 
or could even trigger the big one 
the us geological survey in 1985 predicted a quake measuring 6 
on the richter scale for the parkfield area which has been shaken 
so regularly it has become a prime site for experiments in 
earthquake forecasting 
there is a good possibility that its going to be larger than 
predicted said ralph archuleta a university of california santa 
barbara seismologist who concluded that a quake on the san andreas 
fault near parkfield could measure 72 on the richter scale 
ucla geophysicist david d jackson says the quake might to be 
smaller than the usgspredicted moderate temblor but could 
trigger a magnitude 8 great quake along a longer stretch of the 
fault the longfeared big one 
despite their studies of pentup stress along the fault 
published in the journal geophysical research letters usgs 
stands by its prediction the first and only longterm quake 
prediction endorsed by the national and california earthquake 
prediction evaluation councils 
from the beginning all official statements have said there is 
a possibility of a larger event but we think that possibility is 
small maybe 2 percent said seismologist allan lindh chief 
scientist at the geological surveys parkfield experiment 
geologist kerry sieh a quake prediction pioneer at the 
california institute of technology agrees with archuleta that the 
quake could be a major jolt rather than a moderate or great quake 
but there is an outside chance even a moderate quake could grow or 
trigger a great quake within hours he said 
the predicted magnitude 6 quake near parkfield 180 miles 
northwest of los angeles is expected to cause little damage in the 
town of about 34 residents and the surrounding sparsely populated 
cholame valley which has experienced such jolts roughly every 22 
years most recently in 1966 
the regularity of the quakes spurred the usgs prediction 
based on the theory that a characteristic earthquake occurs 
every time enough stress has built up on the 20milelong parkfield 
segment of the san andreas temblors of about magnitude 6 have 
rocked the segment almost every 22 years jan 9 1857 feb 2 
1881 march 3 1901 march 10 1922 june 8 1934 and june 28 1966 
lindh and archuleta said a major quake probably would cause 
unreinforced brick buildings to collapse 30 miles away in paso 
robles and nonstructural damage as far away as bakersfield san 
luis obispo and perhaps monterey 
a great quake like the one jackson believes is possible would 
rupture the fault well into southern california and could kill 
14000 people hospitalize 55000 and cause 17 billion damage 
according to a 1980 federal report 
archuletas study concluded that in addition to the stress built 
up on the parkfield segment of the fault much strain also has 
accumulated on the next 20mile segment to the southeast which 
could rupture with a magnitude 72 
jacksons study suggests the stress might be enough to make the 
fault break in a great quake along 220 miles of its length 
there is historical precedent for parkfield earthquakes 
triggering great earthquakes it happened once before sieh said 
that was a magnitude 8 jolt in 1857 that killed two people in 
southern california then occupied by only about 4000 
sieh archuleta and lindh all doubt enough stress has built up 
southeast of bitterwater valley for the next parkfield quake to be a 
great quake or trigger one jackson argued that the stress while 
less than that relieved in 1857 is enough to cause a great quake 
and has caused huge shocks on other faults 
he also acknowledges it might not even rupture the entire 
parkfield segment and because the 1934 quake came 10 years earlier 
than would have been expected he says it may be 10 to 15 years 
before the next one and not 1993

an experiment by wellheeled moslem 
fundamentalists to make money by capitalizing on religious 
egyptians devotion to islam has gone sour 
for years more than 100 islamic investment companies seemed to 
work perfectly and by late 1987 hundreds of thousands of mainly 
smalltime investors were participating in the companies 
profitsharing schemes 
the companies drew up to 35 billion from depositors many 
earning three times what they would have from banks and without 
interest banned as usury by islams holy book the koran 
but all was not well behind the scenes rumors circulated of 
illegal dealing by many of the big companies including black 
marketeering capital flight money laundering and skimming off new 
depositors funds to pay obligations to old investors 
finally last august the government stepped in enacting a law 
that in november effectively brought the companies under the control 
of the central bank and the economy ministry 
the result deep legal trouble for most of the companies and a 
long and tormenting wait for investors many of whom face the 
possibility that much of their savings are lost 
the wait ended for some in november when 13 of the 104 
investment companies provided required documentation and said they 
want to stay in business under the new guidelines another 23 
declared they would liquidate and return investors funds 
but officials revealed that 68 companies and individuals 
connected with them were liable for prosecution 
the biggest company alrayyan worth more than 1 billion came 
under heavy fire attorney general gamal shouman ordered detention 
of 49 of its officers their family members and the companys 
accountants and froze their assets on grounds their illegal 
operations jeopardized depositors funds 
under supervision of the ministry of justice security officers 
sealed the companys many warehouses jewelry stores restaurants 
and other establishments 
there is no official estimate of islamic company holdings but 
newspapers have reported totals of 6 billion to 8 billion egyptian 
pounds 26 billion to 35 billion additionally unknown amounts 
are said to be stashed in banks abroad 
the wait has been unpleasant for depositors and the state 
ive been coming here to get my return for three months now 
saddiqa ahmed who had deposited about 870 with alrayyan co said 
as she stood one october day with other disgruntled depositers 
outside company headquarters 
every time they tell me to come back next week now they say 
they have no money to give us what am i to do 
she was among about 175000 people who deposited money sometimes 
lifes savings with alrayyan which operated about four years 
before its closure 
ten female depositors marched on president hosni mubaraks house 
to vent their fury bringing in hundreds of security troops in gas 
masks shields and helmets to protect mubarak from other possible 
outbursts 
the islamic investment movement was begun more than 10 years ago 
by elsherif co a plastic manufacturer that is among the handful 
of companies in full compliance with the new law it drew deposits 
from egyptian workers in oilrich arab states by promising high 
returns through a system prescribed by the 1400yearold islamic 
legal and social system sharia 
sharia bans interest payments on loans or deposits but allows 
profitsharing with its attendant risks 
as islamic fervor increased across the country many more 
companies sprang up company owners pictured in newspaper 
advertisements wearing white robes and skullcaps and long bushy 
beards typical of moslem fundamentalists appealed to investors 
piety as well as investment sense 
targeting egyptian expatriates during the early 1980s arab oil 
boom the companies soon were collecting more remittances in hard 
currency than banks which had to convert the money at official 
exchange rates much below those available on the black market 
since the mid1980s the companies regularly have returned up to 
three times the 10 percent average interest rate offered by banks 
company names many with islamic connotation sprouted along 
highways on billboards and in cities on jewelry stores 
sophisticated butcher shops and alcoholfree restaurants one 
investment company even ran a summer camp and hotel on egypts 
western mediterranean coast 
the government began to suspect dubious activity last year soon 
after reports began appearing of enormous losses by a couple of the 
larger companies from speculating in gold and silver on european 
markets 
many egyptians felt the government acted to curtail a potentially 
dangerous increase in the companies power and because of 
indications that some may have been funding religious extremist 
groups that demand immediate and total implementation of sharia the 
government claims 90 percent of egypts legal code already conforms 
to islamic law 
the government said it acted simply to protect depositors and has 
vowed to try its best to refund them 
hardly any fundamentalist propaganda was evident in this falls 
important university election campaigns campus and police sources 
attributed the decrease to the crackdown either because of a drop 
in direct funding of favored candidates by islamic companies or a 
decline in parents profitsharing income 
by last summer many companies were postponing payments which 
worried customers and prompted firmer government measures such as 
banning company owners from travel 
a week before the november deadline for compliance with the new 
law prime minister atef sidki used a rarely invoked power to issue 
a military order freezing alrayyans monetary transactions 
retroactive to april 1988 but the action created even more 
confusion for investors 
what is the government doing to us protested one depositor 
after the alrayyan freeze was announced we knew these company 
owners were thieves but we were receiving our monthly dividends 
the state is killing us swiftly with its own hands instead of 
leaving us to die slowly he said well never see our money 
to further complicate the situation stories of scandal surfaced 
involving alrayyan and the three brothers who ran it 
one mohammed tawfiq abdelfattah alrayyan was arrested and 
jailed for importing foodstuffs illegally 
at about the same time mohammeds older brother fathy was 
hospitalized for a nervous condition then became addicted to his 
medication he died in early november officially of a heart attack 
but according to newspaper reports more likely of a drug overdose 
as the youngest brother ahmed became chairman of the board the 
government assigned security officers to keep tabs on alrayyan 
family members

a halfcentury search for perfect 
poppers taught jim beebes family a few gourmet secrets 
at the beebe farm a ring of trees shields bins of popcorn from 
scorching sun and chilling wind a bed of air floats the best 
kernels away from the chaff and a popping tube confirms that 
virtually every kernel will explode into one of the nations 
favorite snacks 
quality control is our no 1 job around here said beebe who 
sends slightly imperfect popcorn to feed a cousins hogs we take 
care of our popcorn and dont abuse it 
beebes parents started the business in 1936 after they died 
his sister and brotherinlaw joined him in 1985 to create 
beebestevenson which now grows about 700000 bushels of popcorn a 
year 
the popcorn is sold in containers ranging from 35ounce 
microwave packages to 50pound bags it is marketed in independent 
grocery stores at school ballgames church events and as a 
promotional gift used by businesses 
beebe 50 gave up a danville teaching position and returned in 
august to manage the business 
he plans to concentrate distribution on an area within 50 miles 
of this small eastcentral illinois community 
new products new packaging and new customers are part of beebes 
plan to boost sales in a higly competitive business 
illinois farmers harvested about 36000 acres of popcorn last 
year said to deirdre flynn of the popcorn institute the state is 
generally second or third to the nations popcorn leader indiana 
the united states supplies 90 percent of the worlds popcorn and 
consumes 119 billion quarts of popcorn a year the industry has 
been growing from 4 percent to 6 percent a year 
its a goodforyou snack flynn said there is a lot of 
emphasis now on healthy eating and popcorn is high in fiber and 
carbohydrate and low in calories if you dont just smother it in 
butter 
beebestevenson has had 200 to 300 acres of popcorn in its crop 
rotation in recent years some grown on contract by other farmers in 
illinois and indiana once a delicate plant hybrid seed now has 
made popcorn strong and efficient 
we harvest it on the cob so we keep it in gods wrapper 
beebe said 
it is dried without artificial heat to prevent damage then hand 
shelled the following spring the corn floats over a table on air 
with the perfect kernels moving to one side and on to packages 
beebe said many longtime customers still prefer to buy popcorn 
in bulk at a cost of 30 cents a pound for 50pound bags 
but the microwave market is the place for growth the price is at 
least 10 times higher per pound mainly because of hand labor a 
worker scoops kernels into a microwave bag adds a pinch of salt and 
a squirt of soybean oil and butter flavor 
cousin garrett beebe who manages farming operations said 
popcorn is raised the same way as commercial field corn except for 
the careful handling during and after harvest to make sure the 
kernels will pop

million barrels in november when cartel members were debating how 
to cut output the weekly middle east economic survey reported 
monday 
the agreement in vienna in late november sets production for the 
13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries at 185 
million barrels per day starting january 1 
the economic newsletter said the november daily production hit a 
new peak of 2298 million barrels and that projected december output 
figures are pegged even higher actual production could drop as 
members cut back the weekly said 
the new agreement sets a quota parity for iran and iraq at 264 
million barrels per day iraq rejected its quota under the previous 
1986 agreement saying it needed to finance its war against iran

prime minister brian mulroney today opened the 
most ambitious trade negotiations ever undertaken urging officials 
of 90 nations to compromise to resolve trade differences 
in an apparent reference to a clash between the united states and 
its allies on farm subsidies mulroney exhorted the delegates to 
be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise 
mulroney said farmers around the world are looking for results 
in montreal they can no longer survive on a diet of promises 
the round of trade negotiations is designed to liberalize and 
broaden the general agreement on tariffs and trade an international 
tradepolicing treaty signed in 1947 gatt now has 96 members and 
90 trade ministers were at todays meeting 
the us delegation has come under strong criticism from japan 
australia and the european community over its demand to completely 
eliminate government supports for farmers the 12nation european 
community is only willing to reduce them terming the us position 
unrealistic 
mulroney urged the negotiators to be animated by a spirit of 
realism echoing similar weekend calls to the united states in 
preparatory consultations for the midterm review of the fouryear 
uruguay round of trade talks 
the united states was further isolated by a tentative accord 
reached between the europeans and developing nations that would 
remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the 
industrialized world 
an ec spokeswoman said the united states did not yet support the 
agreement which would affect 70 billion in internaional trade of 
such products as jute bananas and coffee 
michael duffy australias minister of trade negotiations told 
reporters sunday that blame for useuropean impasse over trade 
barriers should be shared by the two parties 
but he and other officials looked to the americans to make the 
first move 
duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the 
threeday talks it will sour the rest of the round which ends 
in 1990 
the dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for 
progress on other urgent trade problems such as the inclusion of 
the booming services trade in the 40yearold gatt pact and the 
adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents 
its hard to see how there can be progress in other areas 
without progress in agriculture said john crosbie canadas 
minister for international trade 
the united states took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would 
stick to its main objective 
chief agriculture negotiator dan amstutz noted the united states 
had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of 
subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long 
as they are bought on the open market 
were flexible he said but wed rather not have any 
agreement than a bad one 
the us delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it 
would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the 
export of tropical products such as bananas and coconuts by 
developing nations 
us trade negotiator alan holmer warned that failure by the gatt 
round could create uncertainties in congress and within the 
incoming administration of george bush he did not elaborate 
but sen patrick leahy of vermont the democratic chairman of the 
senate agriculture committee said failure on the farm support issue 
would result in an exportoriented farm bill 
congress is scheduled to draft a farm bill next year and leahy 
indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete 
effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports 
the united states projects that its 1989 farm supports will 
amount to 13 billion down from the 27 million of 1987 but still 
a heavy burden on the deficitridden budget 
us officials say europeans could save about 200 billion every 
year if they stopped their farm supports but the ec under the 
influence of powerful farm lobbies says eliminating supports is not 
a viable option

grand metropolitan plc on monday extended for 
the sixth time its 60ashare takeover bid for pillsbury co and 
said about 88 percent of pillsburys outstanding shares have been 
tendered 
the british conglomerate said its 523 billion offer now will 
expire at midnight friday est unless extended 
grand mets previous offer expired at midnight last friday at 
which time 75446595 shares of pillsbury common stock had been 
tendered the company said when grand met made a previous extension 
on nov 28 it said that 85 percent of the food and restaurant 
companys common stock had been tendered as nov 25 
pillsbury spokesman johnny thompson said monday he had no comment 
on the latest grand met extension its just another one he 
said 
last week pillsbury chairman philip l smith sent a letter to 
grand met chairman allen sheppard saying the offer was financially 
inadequate and therefore a meeting between the two would serve 
no purpose 
grand met a liquor gambling and specialty products 
conglomerate launched its unsolicited bid for the minneapolisbased 
pillsbury on oct 4 
pillsburys board of directors has rejected the offer as 
inadequate and urged shareholders not to tender their stock 
pillsbury had planned to spin off its burger king subsidiary but 
delayed the move at the request of a delaware court that is hearing 
grand mets challenge of the plan 
grand met also is challenging pillsburys antitakeover poison 
pill defense which makes hostile takeovers prohibitively 
expensive

steel importers said today that the united 
states steel quota program was preferable to the expense and 
uncertainty of trade lawsuits and they proposed modifying it since 
the bush administration seemed intent on renewing it 
the current voluntary restraint agreements on imported steel 
have over the past four years brought about market shortages and 
price increases reduced net manufacturing employment and 
diminished the potential for the export of steelintensive 
products the importers said 
but modifications were endorsed by the american institute for 
imported steel the texas association of steel importers and the 
west coast metal importers assocation 
the institute says any renewed quota plan should be flexible 
enough to avoid the shortages steel users experienced for certain 
products under the current plan they say the more flexible program 
could also lessen the sometimes sharp price hikes on some products 
meanwhile steelconsuming manufacturers who complain about tight 
supplies and sharp price increases go further by saying american 
steel producers are looking a little too prosperous to be demanding 
an extension of trade protection 
those steel users are raising their voices in opposition to a 
renewal of the fiveyear voluntary restraint agreements or import 
quotas due to expire in september 
our guys would kill to be making the profit on sales that 
theyre making right now said greg estell spokesman for the 
1000 member companies of the precision metal forming association 
the clevelandbased association employs about 80000 of the 
estimated 350000 american workers who bend stamp and cut steel 
into parts for cars appliances and a variety of industrial and 
consumer equipment that niche of the steelusing industries alone 
surpasses the approximately 170000 employees of the nations 300 
steelmaking companies 
were not in the same situation here in 1988 that we were in 
1984 estell said about the steel industry 
the numbers back him up 
the 25 steel producers who represent 80 percent of the nations 
raw steel production earned around 1 billion in 1987 the first 
full year of recovery after a gruesome recession they more than 
doubled that figure to nearly 25 billion in the first nine 
months of this year according to the american iron and steel 
institute 
the steel industry has returned to substantial profitability 
and can look forward to another good year in 1989 said inland 
steel industries inc chairman frank w luerssen 
that is whats bothering steel users like caterpillar inc deere 
amp co who see steelmakers raising prices in line with tighter 
supplies while at the same time lobbying presidentelect george bush 
to extend the import quotas for another five years 
steel users say the quota program should be scrapped and a fair 
steel trade system negotiated either countrybycountry or worldwide 
through the mechanisms of the general agreements on tariffs and 
trade 
steelmakers say gatt does not work and that the vras have proved 
themselves as the best solution to the predatory pricing that 
foreign producers employ because of excess world capacity 
caterpillar trade specialist william lane suggested the 
steelmakers want to have their cake and eat it too 
theyre saying they need protection because of surplus world 
capacity but the reason prices are increasing is tight world 
supply he said 
estell said the metal forming association has tracked price 
increases of up to 40 percent for hotrolled steel and 12 to 13 
percent for coldrolled 
the users say the vras are at least partially to blame for higher 
prices because the import quotas reduce the supply in relation to 
demand 
steel producers say the vras have nothing to do with prices 
the users also complain that delivery times were stretched and 
some mills were allocating shipments early this year because of 
tight supplies 
in contrast to the tarnished reputation of american steelmakers 
when recession hit with vengeance after 1981 the us steel 
industry is considered the lowcost producer in the world lane 
said we would certainly agree with that theyve done a 
remarkable job of reducing costs and improving quality 
they say they are worldclass competitors and we tend to 
agree and if thats so then they should act like world 
competitors said estell 
for the nations steel forgers higher prices are less 
troublesome than short supplies they want their prime raw material 
special quality bars and billets removed from the vra program 
because forgers cant get what they need domestically and vras 
prevent them from getting it from offshore the forging industry 
association said 
it is unfair for the us government to support one segment of 
the us economy to the detriment of other segments the 
clevelandbased group said 
the american steelmakers say they deserve another round of quota 
protection because they have not fully recovered from losing 12 
billion during a 5year recession 
it will take much more than a few quarters of profitability to 
offset the financial damage of the 198286 recession years 
washingtonbased aisi said 
the us producers also claim their prices in general have not 
risen drastically 
average steel prices rose about 3 percent from 1980 to 1987 
while average prices of construction equipment rose 6 percent and 
the price of agricultural machinery rose about 20 percent aisi said 
by the second quarter of this year prices were around 7 percent 
higher than they were in the fourth quarter of last year and roughly 
2 percent higher than when the vras were instituted in late 1984 
the aisi calls that hardly a spectacular increase given the 
rate of inflation in the 198187 period and the tight supplydemand 
situation worldwide that existed in the first half of this year

drexel burnham lambert inc the investment giant 
under investigation for more than two years has told employees that 
negotiations with federal prosecutors have reached a crucial 
stage and the firm may either face racketeering indictments or 
plead guilty to lesser charges soon 
chief executive frederick joseph outlined the status of drexels 
crisis in a memorandum to the staff last week copies were leaked to 
the wall street journal and new york times and sources familiar 
with the letter confirmed the contents of the memo today 
a guilty plea would mark a stunning turnaround for drexel which 
vowed to fight accusations of securities fraud that arose after 
speculator ivan f boesky implicated the firm in a plea bargain he 
reached with the government 
boesky who had extensive dealings with drexel paid a record 
100 million in fines and penalties for insider trading and is now 
serving a threeyear prison term for conspiracy to lie to the 
securities and exchange commission 
drexel was named in a sec civil securities fraud complaint nearly 
three months ago and us attorney rudolph giuliani has been 
supervising a grand jury investigation of the firm 
in recent weeks we have had discussions with the government 
which are now reaching a crucial stage joseph told employees in 
the memo 
if drexel does not agree to settlement terms with giuliani the 
memo read we believe that he intends to indict the firm as well 
as certain of our employees and to include in such an indictment 
socalled racketeering charges 
conviction under the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations law which originally was intended to combat drug 
pushers and pimps would taint drexel as a criminal enterprise and 
could entail crippling fines 
if we settle we can put this constant attack on the firm 
behind us joseph said in the memo but to do so will require a 
guilty plea we believe however that the us attorney would not 
accept a settlement from drexel unless it exceeds boeskys 
settlement 
he estimated that as a result of the investigation the firm 
already had lost 15 billion in potential revenues spent 175 
million in direct legal expenses and provided 15 million pages of 
governmentrequested documents 
joseph said any settlement likely would involve what he called a 
substantial dollar amount and a guilty plea by the firm as well 
as other conditions 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment officials at 
giulianis office also declined to comment in accordance with their 
practice of confidentiality about criminal investigations 
the journal quoting sources it did not identify said drexel was 
leaning more toward a settlement because of several recent 
developments notably subpoenas to drexel attorneys from giulianis 
office and his attempts to compel cooperation from a senior employee 
to substantiate the governments case 
the journal quoted sources as saying drexel officials also feared 
they would lose business if the company was branded a racketeer

us district judge harold greene says hes 
become even more convinced over the last year that his decision to 
break up the bell system has been good for residential and business 
customers alike 
longdistance rates have dropped the quality of the telephone 
network has remained high and new telecommunications products and 
services are being offered to consumers faster than ever before he 
said 
the key to all of this is competition he said in an 
interview with the associated press divestiture introduced 
competition real competition for the first time in the 
telecommunications industry and its bound to have a good 
effect 
greene took over the us vs atampt antitrust case in august 1978 
after the death of the original trial judge joseph c waddy and 
continues to monitor the consent decree that settled the case to see 
that the public interest is served 
greene came to the case with a reputation as an activist liberal 
jurist he fled nazi germany with his family in 1939 at age 16 saw 
combat in the army during world war ii and later prosecuted civil 
rights cases for the justice department 
working with attorney general robert f kennedy greene drafted 
the landmark civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 
greenes objective in us vs atampt was to prove the competence 
of the federal courts to manage effectively a major antitrust case 
in the interview greene acknowledged the consumer confusion that 
resulted from the lawsuit that separated american telephone amp 
telegraph co from its local operating companies he also noted that 
it did take atampt and the local companies awhile to get their act 
together after the decree went into effect jan 1 1984 
but he said favorable developments outweigh by far the 
problems that have arisen 
when atampt was the nations major provider of local and 
longdistance service manufacturer of phone equipment and 
telecommunications researcher there was no pressure on it to rush 
new products and services to the market he said 
what they did do is to change the black rotary dial phones to 
the yellow beige pushbutton phones which is nice but in the last 
five years the kinds of innovative things that have occurred in 
household and business phones is the most astounding 
development he said 
many phones are now equipped with memory dialing to allow 
callers with the push of a button to redial the last number called 
or dial a frequently called number a new service beginning to 
appear in homes lets callers know before they answer who is calling 
them he said 
atampt could have done all that bell laboratories and their 
western electric factories were just as good then as they are now 
but they didnt bring them out because nobody forced them there was 
no competition he said 
in exchange for giving up its local operating companies atampt was 
free to enter unregulated businesses that previously were off 
limits including the computer field its longdistance business 
however remained subject to federal regulation and still does 
because it is considered a dominant provider able to affect 
competition in the market 
the seven regional bell companies which inherited atampts local 
phone monopolies and became known as the baby bells were 
constrained in the antitrust decree because of their control of the 
local loops their local phone operations have remained 
regulated but they have been free to enter certain unregulated 
lines of business 
greene however has been unmoved by their pleas for more 
freedom the regional companies persuaded the justice department two 
years ago to recommend that the judge allow the bell companies to 
provide limited longdistance and electronic information services 
and manufacture telecommunications equipment 
greene rejected most of the recommendations but allowed the 
companies to transmit though not originate information services 
and until he finds evidence that the bell companies local 
monopolies have substantially eroded he said he sees no reason to 
lift the restrictions 
atampt was able to disadvantage and discriminate against smaller 
competitors because they were in control of the local loops and 
now the regional companies have those local loops he said 
as long as that exists they have the same abilities to engage 
in anticompetitive activities as atampt did and they certainly have 
the same incentive to make money that atampt did he said 
the baby bells have lobbied hard in congress and in the reagan 
administration to free them from the constraints of the decree 
arguing that they have the resources to bring the information age to 
the average american and greene is standing in the way 
their political supporters say the judge has become a 
telecommunications czar by keeping control of national 
communications policy in the courts 
greene dismisses the criticism and says congress has the 
authority to free the baby bells if it wants to hes certain 
however what the result would be if the restrictions were lifted 
from the bell monopolies now 
we would be right back where we were before all this was 
settled in 1984 he said

the baby bell telephone companies as part of 
the atampt breakup were given the lucrative yellow pages business 
because it was feared they would be unable to survive apart from 
their parent 
as it turns out five years later those fears were unfounded 
the seven baby bells which carved up american telephone amp 
telegraph cos local operating networks are among the nations 
corporate giants with assets ranging from 19 billion to 27 billion 
and investments in a variety of domestic and international 
businesses 
in fact directory publishing has become such a good moneymaker 
that many of the bells have removed yellow pages from the regulated 
side of their businesses and now use those profits to support other 
competitive ventures 
they came out of the blocks faster than anyone anticipated 
said robert morris iii a san franciscobased telecommunications 
analyst with goldman sachs amp co 
some say the baby bells learned to run before they learned to 
walk 
many of their investments in the early years went sour and many 
hundreds of millions of dollars were lost some analysts said those 
investments were a sign that the companies were still acting and 
thinking like regulated businesses and hadnt yet learned how to 
compete in the open market 
its still too early to say the baby bells have outgrown the 
legacy of what some people say is a bellshaped head said michael 
dortch an independent market analyst based in san francisco 
at englewood colobased u s west inc chairman jack a 
macallister said his companys failed attempt at expanding its 
customer equipment business beyond its 14state region taught the 
company something about competition 
we didnt understand the market sufficiently and as we got into 
the business the margins disappeared so the company pulled out 
of the business and took a 100 million writedown in the fourth 
quarter of 1986 he said 
that was hard for us to take but the good part about it was it 
set a tenor for our business he said we made up our mind that 
as we get into competition there are going to be some times we win 
and some times we fail and when we see that we made a mistake 
instead of trying to wish it would be better we try to face up to 
the mistake

for five years american telephone amp telegraph 
co watched passively as its longdistance competitors built their 
networks and lured customers from the industry leader with lower 
prices and new services 
but the sleeping giant has begun to stir analysts say 
what youll see is the dawning of a new age in longdistance 
beginning now where atampt goes from being a benevolent giant to 
being a real nasty monster said jack grubman a painewebber inc 
telecommunications analyst 
this new aggressiveness is likely to mean slower growth for 
atampts rivals notably the two largest mci communications corp and 
us sprint communications co but analysts expect that the rapid 
pace of this 50 billionayear industry will help them sustain 
healthy growth 
mcis earnings for example will increase but instead of 385 
percent this year they will increase 88 percent next year 
predicted robert morris iii of goldman sachs amp co its still an 
awfully attractive rate of growth and better than the market 
atampt has been modernizing its network during the five years since 
the bell system was broken up jan 1 1984 and offering new 
services but grubman says that for the most part the company has 
been relatively passive letting competition take hold to justify 
the divestiture 
however now that atampts overall share of the longdistance 
market has slipped from close to 90 percent at divestiture into the 
70 percent range the company is sending signals that it plans to 
become far more aggressive grubman said 
atampt vice chairman randall l tobias rejects grubmans scenario 
saying weve been aggressive in everything weve done however 
he said the characterization that were getting more aggressive 
is fair 
atampt is pushing hard for more pricing flexibility from federal 
regulators to put it on the same footing as its unfettered rivals 
as part of that effort atampt is lobbying the federal communications 
commission to adopt a new regulatory structure that would set upper 
and lower limits on prices 
as it is now rates are based on a calculation of how much profit 
atampt can make in comparison to the size of its asset base 
atampt also has been coming out with new products and services that 
are direct responses to offerings of mci and us sprint 
additionally atampt has been beefing up its sales and marketing staff 
and recently announced plans to cut thousands of jobs and take a 
67 billion charge against fourthquarter earnings to cover 
expenses related to removing outdated phone equipment 
although the charge will result in the first annual loss in 
atampts 103year history analysts said it showed the companys 
determination to become more competitive 
i think they are going to unleash fast and furiously a lot of 
creative pricing plans for large customers in particular and 
theyll be able to maintain high profitability because theres a lot 
of costs they can shed but had no incentive to do under 
profitlimiting rateofreturn regulation grubman said 
with nearly 27 million shareowners atampt is still the most 
widely held stock of any us company 
atampts earnings suffered in the first three years after 
divestiture but in 1987 a corporate refocusing helped the company 
post record earnings of 2 billion or 188 per share on revenues 
of 34 billion net income was up 82 percent the first nine months 
of this year 
atampts share of the market has dropped to around 70 percent in 
terms of minutes of use of its network but in terms of its revenues 
the company commands a larger share estimated usually at more than 
75 percent because its prices are generally higher than those of 
its rivals 
mci now a 6 billionayear company has had a startlingly good 
year with earnings through the third quarter up nearly fourfold on 
steadily rising revenues from 800 and international services and 
gains in commercial accounts 
mci has become a truly viable alternative to atampt said 
edward greenberg of morgan stanley amp co who estimates that mci has 
about 11 percent of the longdistance business 
according to his survey of corporate telecommunications 
executives at the start of the year 38 percent said that by 1990 
they would choose mci as their main longdistance company compared 
with 11 percent in his 1987 survey 
us sprint with about 4 billion in annual revenues and an 
estimated 7 percent share of the longdistance pie is still 
struggling to turn a profit but with its nationwide fiberoptic 
network complete analysts believe it will find its footing soon 
sprint is starting to become a contender greenberg said 
were seeing them get large contracts with major players if 
theyre not there yet theyre darn close to it 
atampt mci and us sprint all are looking over their shoulders at 
the regional bell operating companies spun off from atampt in the 
divestiture and anxious to have restrictions on their businesses 
lifted so they can get into the longdistance business 
the most fundamental thing that could just be the biggest step 
backwards on all of the positive things that have happened since 
divestiture would be if the bell operating companies were allowed 
into longdistance said bert c roberts jr mci president 
thats really the roman candle he said

the most important communications device at the 
dawn of the 21st century will probably be one that was invented in 
the 19th century the underappreciated telephone 
in spite of brave talk about videotex picture phones and fiber 
links to the home the ordinary telephone will continue to hold sway 
as the most important communications device in the home and office 
consider that the telephone backed by a worldwide network worth 
hundreds of billions of dollars permits any person to contact any 
other person simply by picking up a receiver and dialing a series of 
digits 
nothing on the horizon promises to rival the telephone as a 
device for allowing meetings of the mind whether between corporate 
chiefs or members of the monday bridge club 
we will come to realize by the year 2000 the excitement of the 
telephone we take it for granted too much said michael noll a 
professor at the university of southern californias annenberg 
school of communications 
the 1984 breakup of the bell system probably sped up the 
introduction of new communications technologies but many of the 
changes would have come anyway in response to global competition and 
the demands of customers 
the telephone of the future will be more useful than the phone of 
1988 because of the spread of answering machines and computerized 
features such as voice mail which allows a person to record a 
message and have it stored and forwarded at will 
cellular phones will be so common by the year 2000 that it will 
be ordinary for people to make and receive phone calls from trains 
planes and canoes 
facsimile machines that are hooked to the phone network will 
continue to spread cutting into the business of overnight delivery 
services 
another oldtime communication device the television will 
continue to hold sway in the coming era only the picture and sound 
will be better the content will probably be about the same for 
better or worse 
human nature will delay the spread of other longpromised 
communications advances much to the disappointment of technology 
buffs 
for example the 20yearold picture phone is likely to reach its 
40th birthday without finding its way into every home even if the 
quality of the picture is much improved 
the problem is not technology its human behavior noll 
said people would rather not be seen while talking on the phone 
some thinkers are more optimistic about picture phones i 
simply cannot believe that people voluntarily will reduce the amount 
of information they can get by talking to each other said eli 
noam a member of the new york state public service commission on 
leave from columbia university 
after repeated failures videotex is likely to find a niche but 
again human nature will probably limit the potential of the 
technology many people still want to deal with another person when 
they bank or make airline reservations even if it would be faster 
to do it on a home terminal 
as for getting information on a videotex terminal the biggest 
market is likely to be businessrelated research the day when 
people read their daily news on a terminal instead of a front page 
seems far off 
the biggest bust for the remainder of this century will probably 
be the extension of glass fiber cables to homes and small 
businesses fiber can carry thousands of times more information than 
the kind of oldfashioned copper cables that have been in use for 
decades but it is not clear why the extra capacity is urgently 
needed 
phone companies say the extra bandwidth offered by fiber 
would permit companies to offer specialized services such as 
monitoring burglar alarms and thermostats from central locations 
but those services and most others could easily be handled over 
existing cables 
highquality video is the one thing that could take advantage of 
the huge capacity of fiber but cable tv subscribers already get 
video coming into their homes on a cable even if it does not have 
quite the carrying capacity of optical fiber 
direct satellite broadcast is another way to deliver highquality 
video into homes without the huge cost of installing fibers so are 
improved video cassette recorders 
bringing fiber to the home would require replacing 52 million 
miles of existing copper cables estimated richard j solomon a 
research associate at the massachusetts institute of technology 
media lab 
it will happen he said but probably not for 20 or 30 years 
theres a horrible tendency to try to take what we have and 
extend it in making predictions what usually happens is theres a 
whole leap to a brand new technology noll said

surging 3396 points to 212624 by the time the london session drew

billion to 11 billion reflecting in part the tightening of some 
commodity supplies by this years drought 
the rural voice survey found farmers themselves divided over 
specific policy alternatives as congress begins to consider 
directions for new farm legislation 
half of those surveyed said the government should put more effort 
into nonagricultural industries and jobs in rural areas strong 
majorities favored targeting farm program benefits to small and 
mediumsized family farms 72 percent strengthening regulations on 
pesticide use 74 percent and expanding the conservation reserve to 
reduce use of pesticides 68 percent 
fiftysix percent favored higher pricesupport levels for crops 
and 59 percent said they approve of the use of export subsidies to 
protect us world market share 
a majority 62 percent said they support the gradual elimination 
of all farm subsidies worldwide over a 10year period if all 
countries participate but they narrowly opposed 50 to 42 percent 
unilateral action to end subsidies

philip morris cos said monday it has nearly 
completed its 129 billion buyout of kraft inc and the creation of 
the worlds largest consumer products company 
about 98 percent of krafts outstanding shares or more than 117 
million shares had been tendered under philip morris 106ashare 
cash offer that expired friday according to the tobacco and 
consumer products giant 
philip morris said it planned to complete the acquisition as soon 
as possible but offered no specific date 
the merger is one of a series of recent huge deals in the food 
business capped by rjr nabisco incs agreement last week to be 
acquired by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co for 
nearly 25 billion 
philip morris tender offer was about 77 percent higher than the 
60 a share kraft stock was trading at before the takeover plan was 
disclosed in midoctober 
philip morris initially offered 90 a share but kraft rejected 
that as inadequate and proposed a recapitalization plan that it 
valued at 110 a share including a cash dividend of 84 a share 
by late october however the two companies signed an agreement 
under which philip morris agreed to pay 106 a share in cash for all 
of krafts stock the kraft acquisition will unite two companies 
that had combined sales of 376 billion in 1987 surpassing the 
nearly 31 billion in sales reported by the anglodutch concern 
unilever nv currently the worlds biggest consumer products company 
it also will bring wellknown kraft brands such as miracle whip 
salad dressing velveeta cheese sealtest ice cream and tombstone 
frozen pizzas into the same corporate umbrella as marlboro 
cigarettes maxwell house coffee post cereals oscar mayer meats 
and miller beer 
last week the federal trade commission cleared the philip 
morriskraft deal although critics argued the merger would give 
philip morris too much power over prices supply systems and 
advertising time 
philip morris denied the deal would be anticompetitive

a former top executive of intelsat was 
sentenced monday to 16 months to four years imprisonment for his 
role in a 48 million kickback scheme involving construction of the 
satellite consortiums headquarters 
in imposing the sentence us district judge gerhard a gesell 
said jose l alegrett former deputy director general of intelsat 
would receive credit for the five months he has been in custody 
since his arrest in aruba last summer 
gesell noting the defendants cooperation with a continuing 
federal investigation of alleged corruption by former intelsat 
executives said he would recommend that alegrett be paroled after 
serving 11 months 
assistant us attorney david f geneson told gesell that since 
his arrest as a fugitive last summer alegrett has cooperated with 
the government in a very substantial manner 
alegrett has not only aided the governments investigation of the 
construction kickback scheme but was providing information of 
great value for a probe of two other areas geneson said 
geneson was referring to an investigation of allegations that 
consultants hired by two communications satellite manufacturers 
hughes aircraft co and ford aerospace corp had paid kickbacks to 
former intelsat officials 
defense attorney alan bayles told the court of a letter from 
general motors corp which owns hughes aircraft citing alegretts 
cooperation 
alegrett pleaded guilty sept 16 to interstate transportation of 
money obtained by fraud in connection with the kickback scheme 
as part of the plea alegrett paid intelsat 11 million in 
restitution according to a source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the case stemmed from a scheme by intelsats director general 
richard r colino alegrett and two businessmen to siphon 38 
million to 48 million in kickbacks from construction contracts to 
build the consortiums new world headquarters 
intelsat acronym for the international telecommunications 
satellite organization provides a global communications network 
with satellites that serve 114 member nations 
gesell told alegrett that the sentence was intended to punish 
rather than rehabilitate him i think you are a man who comes from 
a tradition of honor gesell said 
but this was not a case of a simple mistake gesell said 
this was a deliberately continuing conniving scheme carried out 
with deceit 
alegrett was arrested last july in aruba where he had traveled 
from his native venezuela to meet with a federal agent aruban 
authorities agreed to arrest alegrett on a us warrant which was 
issued after lengthy plea negotiations with federal prosecutors had 
been broken off 
colino is serving a sixyear term for criminal fraud and 
conspiracy he has denied knowledge of kickbacks by hughes or ford 
aerospace 
but the civil suit filed by intelsat againt colino charges that 
he and an associate arranged for ford aerospace to hire a chilean 
consulting firm to perform a study to forecast satellite demand 
of the 125000 that the firm was to be paid colino arranged for 
him and an associate to receive 100000 according to the lawsuit

a federal jury found monday that the long island 
lighting co and a former executive engaged in a pattern of lies to 
obtain rate increases to help pay for its shoreham nuclear power 
plant 
the verdict under the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations statute awards 228 million in damages to suffolk 
county and could make lilco liable for 18 billion if the trial 
judge certifies the suit a class action on behalf of all ratepayers 
the utility through its attorney michael lesch immediately 
issued a onesentence statement that said the verdict was 
insupportable and that lilco would seek to set it aside or 
reverse it on appeal 
the sevenmember jury in us district court in brooklyn found 
that lilco and a former president wilfred o uhl violated the rico 
statute by lying to the public service commission on three occasions 
about the completion schedule of shoreham in order to obtain rate 
hikes 
the verdict followed a twomonth trial of the countys civil 
racketeering suit against lilco the jury awarded 76 million in 
damages to the county for what it overpaid on utility costs because 
of fraudulently obtained rate increases in 1978 and 1984 
that amount is tripled to 228 million under the federal 
racketeering statue the county had sought up to 72 million in 
damages 
the jury rejected the countys charges that lilco deceived the 
psc in obtaining other rate increases in 1975 1976 1979 and 1981 
it also found no violations by three other former lilco officials 
who were defendants 
i think the jury spoke loud and clearly that lilco had been 
engaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade said kenneth 
mccallion who was the countys lead attorney during the twomonth 
trial 
a verdict in this case has to send a message to all parties 
that the fraud engaged in by lilco has to be a major factor for 
those who are considering the fate of shoreham mccallion said 
last week in albany the state legislature let pass by a deadline 
for approving a plan that would keep shoreham closed and give lilco 
5 percent annual rate hikes over the next decade 
lilco has said that while the plan could be revived it would 
proceed toward licensing the plant 
suffolk county executive patrick halpin called the verdict a 
great victory for the county and suffolks ratepayers 
according to testimony at the trial the shoreham plant which is 
located 55 miles east of manhattan had originally been scheduled to 
be in operation in 1978 at a cost of 77 million construction was 
completed in 1985 but the plant was never opened because of public 
opposition 
the county alleged that lilco spent 8 billion in the 
construction of shoreham but lilco says the plant cost 53 billion 
originally the county had wanted to make the suit a class action 
on behalf of all lilco customers but us district judge jack b 
weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started 
after the verdict weinstein said he would now accept a motion 
asking him to certify the class and indicated that if he granted the 
request lilco could be liable for up to 18 billion

democrats called social security officials on 
the carpet monday over draft regulations to limit the rights of 
people trying to obtain benefits even though commissioner dorcas 
hardy already killed the controversial proposal 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
said the plan would have violated congress intent that the benefits 
hearings process be nonadversarial and simple enough for an 
individual claimant to navigate without legal representation 
he said that based on past actions he feared what steps the 
agency might take in the future 
rep tom downey dny said the administration does not have 
a track record on social security that i feel comfortable with 
theres suspicion 
downey acting chairman of the public assistance subcommittee 
cited an instance last christmas when he said the reagan 
administration tried to count as income the blankets and food that 
poor social security recipients might get from local charities 
hardy over the weekend rejected the draft staff regulations one 
of which would have required claimants to submit all evidence in a 
proceeding at least seven days before it began 
deputy commissioner louis enoff assured the ways and means 
committee on monday that hardys decision was final 
theyve been tossed enoff said of the regulations they 
will not be considered or started anew they will not officially 
be brought forward in the social security administration 
most of the 300000 people who request hearings each year before 
administrative law judges are seeking disability benefits and most 
who appeal denials eventually win an appeal through the 
administrative process to the court level takes an average of nearly 
two years 
under questioning by downey enoff denied that the draft 
regulations were developed to cut the number of appeals our 
primary concern is getting the correct decision at the earliest 
point in the process he said he said 110 administrative law 
judges were added last year bringing the total to more than 700 
republicans complained bitterly that the hearing was unnecessary 
in light of hardys action and inconvenient since it was held while 
gop members met to elect leaders for the 101st congress 
i must conclude that the majority is unwilling to let the media 
down said rep hal daub rneb he said even without hardys 
action given the glacial pace of regulatory change the hearing 
would have been premature 
downey defended the hearing saying congress is extraordinarily 
sensitive to any social security changes and brooks no effort 
to instill among the elderly and disabled fear of their own 
government 
the people who did these draft regulations were not out to 
intimidate or hurt anybody enoff replied he said one reason for 
proposing the advance evidence requirement is that some lawyers 
introduce evidence at the end of a proceeding simply to prolong it 
because they make more money that way 
he said the system remains targeted for change and he challenged 
committee members to ask other witnesses most of them from senior 
advocacy groups if they would deny that the hearings and appeals 
process sorely needs improving 
in testimony to the committee many groups agreed the process 
needed to be improved the most common suggestion was that the 
social security administration hire more people in order to better 
determine the validity of disability claims when they are first made 
and several witnesses said administrative law judges need more 
independence from the social security bureaucracy

eastman kodak co monday announced the 
development of a new computer chip that it claims will vastly 
improve the quality of electronicallygenerated photos 
the chip was immediately hailed as an advance in the race with 
the japanese to integrate photographic technology with computers 
industry analyst jacques kauffmann said the chip dramatically 
improves the clarity of electronicallygenerated images and may 
shorten the time it takes to make that technology available to 
consumers 
kodak has made its fortune in silver halide photography a 
technology that requires an image to be captured on film 
but since the early 1970s it has been working on electronic 
photography which captures images on a computer disk that converts 
the image into electrons 
companies that are working on electronic photography havent 
marketed it widely to consumers because they havent been able to 
develop a sensor with enough picture elements also called pixels 
the more pixels the sharper the picture so few pixels has meant 
mediocre picture quality 
the sensor that kodak introduced monday has 4 million pixels 
twice as many as the best available up to now 
kauffmann said the picture quality of 4 million pixels is 
comparable to the quality of prints from 110 film kodak spokesman 
timothy hughes said it is 11 times the quality of a camcorder image 
and twice the clarity of highdefinition television pictures 
last spring japans nec corp and toshiba announced a 
2millionpixel prototype the best available before that was 
kodaks own 14millionpixel sensor introduced in 1986 the 
picture quality of a 14millionpixel image is comparable to that 
of kodaks disc camera kauffmann said 
but he cautioned that there is a big gap between commercial and 
consumer applications 
its far from being a consumer level product kauffmann said 
kodak has said that its main thrust right now is to continue to 
develop its conventional film so the picture quality stays ahead of 
electronic photography its topoftheline ektar film introduced 
in october is evidence of that effort 
and hughes said the cost of this 4millionpixel sensor makes 
consumer applications prohibitively expensive he said kodak wont 
discuss the sensors cost until next spring 
when the prototype becomes available early next year followed by 
product introduction in the middle of the year kodak expects about 
a dozen customers from science government and industry to be 
interested hughes said he said customers probably will use the 
technology to take an electronic picture of a photograph so they can 
look at it on a computer screen and transmit it to other computers

british steel plcs shares rose in active trading 
monday as they began changing hands but dealers said the gain was 
disappointing because it was not big enough to bring instant profit 
to small investors as past privatizations have 
the shares immediately rose to 6225 pence or 116 up 225 
pence or 4 cents from the partly paid offering price soon after 
trading began at 230 pm on londons stock exchange they finished 
the session at that early level 
volume amounted to 261 million shares 
the british steel shares were priced at 125 pence or 234 each 
valuing the entire company at 25 billion pounds or the equivalent 
of 47 billion but the shares were offered on an installment basis 
with an initial payment of 60 pence or 112 a share 
the offering was more than three times oversubscribed the 
government said private investors made around 650000 applications 
for more than 15 billion shares compared with the 452 million 
shares on offer to them 
the government decided to allocate 842 million shares to the 
private investors or 42 percent of the total 2 billion shares by 
cutting the size of the portions which had been provisionally placed 
with british and overseas institutions 
market watchers described the first day of trading in british 
steel as anticlimactic and much ado about nothing 
dealers said the premium was disappointing because it was too 
small to give private investors any profit by selling their shares 
on the first day of dealing after taking dealing costs into account 
trading activity was mainly due to buying and selling among 
institutions with some of the issues british subunderwriters 
seeking to reduce their holdings somewhat on the first day of 
dealing dealers said 
at the moment we are seeing selling from those uk 
institutions that were happy to underwrite the issue but arent 
longterm holders and buying from the institutions that are more 
optimistic one senior dealer said 
dealers said some participants were discouraged by mondays 
overall fall in prices on the stock market 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed off 34 
points or 02 percent at 17616 
meanwhile advisers to the government the investment firm samuel 
montagu and co said they were investigating around 2000 of the 
650000 applications put in by private british investors for 
suspected multiple applications its illegal to put in more than 
one application for shares in britians privatizations

steel importers conceded monday that they are 
unlikely to win a repeal of import quotas and proposed ways to make 
the program more palatable 
were trying to be realistic said john griffin newly 
elected president of the american institute for imported steel 
the new yorkbased importers association the texas association 
of steel importers and the west coast metal importers association 
said presidentelect george bush should among other things soften 
the strict productbyproduct quotas that created shortages over the 
last two years 
the more than 30 product quotas prevented foreign producers from 
shipping additional steel plate for factory floors and bridge decks 
for example when us producers could not meet demand 
weve seen projects where they leave holes in the deck because 
you cant get plate said griffin who is also president of the 
houston steel trader maurice pincoffs co 
the us quotas negotiated by the reagan administration starting 
in 1984 were designed to limit foreign steel to roughly 20 percent 
of the us market 
domestic steel companies contend they still need protection as 
the us industry restructures but steel users are urging the 
quotas be dropped 
known as voluntary restraint agreements the quotas ignore 
the interests of consumers of steelintensive produces and brought 
about market shortages and price increases reduced net 
manufacturing employment in the united states and diminished the 
potential for the export of steelintenive products the importers 
association said in a statement 
american steelmakers deny any connection between the quotas and 
steel price increases and they deny there have been any true 
shortages only a renewal of the quotas will check predatory trade 
practices and allow time to continue the turnaround that has brought 
the domestic industry profits of 325 billion in the last seven 
quarters after losses of 12 billion over the preceding five years 
they say 
the importers said that barring a change of heart by bush they 
prefer the quota plan to the unfair trade complaints that us 
producers say they will file if the current fiveyear program is 
allowed to expire on schedule in september bush has said he favors 
continuing the quota system 
the alternative was to either have this type of organized 
orderly market or to have a series of harrassments such as the ones 
that led to this quota the counterveiling duty case or the 
dumping case and they are poison said fred lamesch a past 
president of the importers association 
counterveiling duties can be levied against imports shown to have 
damaged us competitors as a result of unfair pricing dumping is 
the practice of exporting goods at prices set artificially below the 
cost of production 
us producers say both tactics aggravated their 198286 
recession during which they were forced to slash employment by 
roughly half to todays 170000 workers 
lamesch said none of the top steelexporting nations have granted 
any steel production subsidies for several years the only subsidies 
still available to european producers are those that help pay 
employee benefits when plants close he said 
the french say america has the biggest subsidy by being able to 
give pink slips to workers on friday and say dont come back on 
monday said hans mueller an economist professor at middle 
tennessee state university who is a cosultant for the importers 
group 
most of the subsidies are optical illusions mueller said 
we see subsidies in anything different than what we do 
with the bush inauguration still six weeks away and with nine 
months remaining before the quotas are scheduled to expire american 
steel users already are complaining that the domestic steel industry 
seems too prosperous to be demanding further trade protection 
our guys would kill to be making the profit on sales that 
theyre making right now greg estell spokesman for the 1000 
member companies of the precision metal forming association said 
friday 
the clevelandbased organization represents 80000 of the 
approximately 350000 americans who bend stamp and cut steel into 
parts for vehicles appliances and other products that 
steelconsuming niche alone has more than twice as many employees as 
basic steelmaking 
others demanding changes or abandonment of the quotas include the 
steel service center institute the forging industry association and 
the heavy equipment manufacturers caterpillar inc and deere amp co

textile giant west pointpepperell inc is 
offering more than 800 employees early retirement in an effort to 
trim down the company which has grown through the acquisition of 
two competitors 
the company says the program is not connected to its efforts to 
thwart a 14 billion takeover attempt by chicagobased farley inc 
a company spokesman said the offer would affect between 800 and 
900 salaried pepperell employees including those who came from 
cluett peabody amp co acquired in 1986 and from jp stevens amp co 
inc acquired this year 
the spokesman said the plan which offers enhanced retirement 
benefits to employees aged 55 with 10 years service is not 
connected with the farley bid 
the offer is being made in the normal course of business the 
spokesman said its something that had been looked at for quite a 
while when they were looking at the need to cut back staff 
pepperell based in west point ga has 41000 employees and is 
the nations largest publicly held textile company 
farley whose privately held conglomerate includes the maker of 
fruit of the loom underwear is engaged in a monthlong battle with 
pepperell management to buy up the company for 48 per share tender 
offer 
the latest volley in the battle also came monday as farley took 
out fullpage advertisements in several newspapers including the 
atlanta journal the atlanta constitution and the new york times 
claiming managements most important objective is to entrench 
management not to do whats right for the owners of more than 99 
percent of west pointpepperell shares not owned by management 
the advertisement attacked pepperells handling of cluett and 
stevens claiming both companies had deteriorated since their 
acquisition by pepperell 
the ad was in reply to a similar effort two weeks ago by 
pepperell saying in part why turn a healthy thriving globally 
competitive company like west pointpepperell into another 
moneylosing farley enterprise

the united states is presenting itself as the 
hero of free trade in agricultural products at talks here but its 
own record is hardly unblemished 
the united states has import quotas on sugar and on dairy 
products such as butter and cheese it also limits imports of beef 
from nations such as australia and new zealand through voluntary 
restraint agreements 
the united states will spend about 13 billion in the coming year 
for subsidies to farmers through price supports export subsidies 
and other programs 
although that level of support is about half of recent levels 
the drop is the result of a recent rise in world food prices not 
fundamental reform costs would shoot back up if plentiful world 
harvests depressed world prices 
the most conspicuous example of protectionism is on sugar where 
domestic producers with strong clout in washington have managed to 
obtain approval of import quotas that keep prices high by 
restricting the supply 
because of quotas american consumers pay about twice the 
prevailing world price for sugar 
this is not a rough estimate on the coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange in new york the bulk price for sugar for january delivery 
is currently 11 cents a pound outside the united states and 22 cents 
a pound inside the united states 
in addition to hurting us consumers the import quotas hurt 
sugar exporters such as the philippines the dominican republic and 
brazil which need the dollars in part to pay interest on loans from 
us banks 
were basically shutting these countries most of which are 
friendly and dependent on us from our market said dale hathaway 
a former undersecretary of agriculture 
the european economic community has more extensive protection and 
subsidies of farmers than the united states does 
but japan which americans often regard as highly protectionist 
on agriculture will have a fairly open market after a recent 
liberalization of beef and citrus imports goes into effect rice 
will be the only remaining food that japan heavily protects 
youre dealing with an area where there are no puritans only 
sinners said hathaway a member of the international policy 
council on agriculture and trade

the pentagon awarded a contractor team led by 
the martin marietta corp a 347 million contract on monday in a key 
step toward conducting star wars laser experiments in space 
the 30month contract represents a major installment in what is 
to be a 15 billion program codenamed zenith star 
martin mariettas denver aerospace division and its two 
subcontractors have been told to proceed with the final design and 
development work on a small laser and associated equipment that 
could be boosted into space for experimental firing in 1994 the 
pentagon said in a statement 
zenith star involves research aimed at proving the feasibility of 
firing laser beams at orbiting mirrors which in turn direct the 
beam to moving targets 
the martin marietta team was selected over two competitors in 
october 1987 to produce a plan for star wars experiments that would 
prove spacebased laser weapons are feasible the two subcontractors 
are the lockheed missile and space co and trw inc 
the star wars program known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative is a research effort aimed at developing various exotic 
weapons that could be used to automatically shoot down nuclear 
ballistic missiles fired at the united states or its allies

manufacturers improved their productivity at an 
annual rate of more than 5 percent in the third quarter the 
government said monday but other businesses had more difficulty in 
keeping increases in their labor costs below the rate of inflation 
the labor department reported a 52 percent increase in 
productivity on assembly lines a 72 percent jump in annual output 
was accompanied by only a 18 percent jump in employment and 
overtime to accomplish it 
the net productivity figure is usually close but not identical to 
the difference between output and costs because it is computed 
differently 
businesses as a whole did not fare as well continuing a trend 
that began with the recovery from the 198182 recession and offering 
little hope for raising the nations living standards 
productivity among nonfarm businesses including the service 
sector that now accounts for about half of the nations economic 
activity improved by just 19 percent on 34 percent higher output 
and a 15 percent rise in hours worked 
over the past 12 months nonfarm business productivity has risen 
by only 09 percent compared with 08 percent for all of 1987 that 
is onethird the rate in 1983 the first year coming out of the 
recession and half the rates of 1984 and 1986 
its pretty puny said michael evans who runs an economic 
forecasting firm in washington the ability to raise our standard 
of living is hardly improving at all thats the real effect of the 
budget deficits and these leveraged buyouts of corporations 
were spending all these billions on interest payments instead 
of capital improvements research and development and 
infrastructure he said thats our major economic problem and 
we dont seem to be attacking it 
still the 19 percent improvement in efficiency was better than 
the 13 percent estimated earlier before the government last week 
revised the nations gross national product upward for the third 
quarter it also nearly offset a 24 percent decline in productivity 
in the second quarter 
its a strong number when you consider that traditionally 
productivity tends to level off when we get close to full 
utilization of labor and plant resources said robert lawrence an 
economist for the brookings institution a washington think tank 
it suggests that the improvement is coming from innovation 
instead of just using idle resources more fully lawrence said 
hourly compensation costs led by what analysts said were larger 
wage gains among lowerpaid service workers and higher social 
security taxes on employers rose at an annual rate of 56 percent 
in the third quarter and are 49 percent above what they were a year 
ago 
that raised unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector for 
the third quarter at an annual rate of 37 percent including a 68 
percent annual rise the second quarter and a 54 percent jump the 
last three months of 988 labor costs are now 4 percent above what 
they were a year ago barely below the 44 percent increase in 
consumer prices over the same period 
this is a distinctive sign of worse inflation to come and 
growing pressure on profit margins said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co a new york financial consulting house 
the 52 percent increase in more narrow category of manufacturing 
productivity was the best improvement since a 55 percent gain in 
the spring of 1987 
other labor department data show that assemblyline hiring slowed 
considerably over the summer with only a net gain of 5000 new 
factory jobs in the third quarter compared with 425000 new jobs 
over the past year 
analysts attributed much of the slowdown in assemblyline hiring 
to the drought which caused canneries and other foodprocessing 
operations to add fewer employees than normal after harvests 
with the creation of 160000 new factory jobs in october and 
november and assembly line workers continuing to average four hours 
of overtime each week sinai said manufacturing productivity 
improvements also are bound to fade soon 
no matter what the increase in gnp in the fourth quarter there 
will be a huge increase in hours worked and labor costs and we 
havent even had any strong wage bargaining yet he said this 
is probably the last of the good news 
the labor department data showed hourly employee compensation 
costs in manufacturing rising at an annual rate of 47 percent in 
the third quarter compared with an annualized gain of only 3 
percent in the spring 
however after accounting for inflation factory workers saw no 
increase in their purchasing power from the compensation gains and 
over the past year they actually have lost 03 percent in buying 
power despite nominal wage and benefit gains of 38 percent the 
labor department said 
still the increased productivity enabled factories to reduce 
their unit labor costs by onehalf of one percent in the third 
quarter after a 07 percent decline in the second quarter 
and over the past 12 months the labor costs associated with each 
item coming off an assembly line are up only 04 percent they had 
declined by 12 percent in 1987 when the united states japan and 
france were the only three major industrialized nations to reduce 
unit labor costs in manufacturing from 1986

chicago board of trade in a selloff led by a single large trading 
company and apparently linked to forecasts for rain in brazil 
on other markets futures prices for oil and precious metals 
futures declined while stockindex and pork futures advanced and 
cattle futures were mixed 
soybean and corn futures sustained deeper losses than the wheat 
market on the board of trade with a strong lineup of export 
tenders supporting wheat futures analysts said 
in otherwise thin market conditions iowa grain co a large 
speculative trading firm was said to have sold contracts 
representing about 5 million bushels each of wheat corn and 
soybeans and hundreds of metric tons of soybean meal and soybean oil 
thomas cunningham president of the chicagobased company could 
not be reached for comment but observers said iowa grain had 
purchased the contracts on friday while many smaller players were 
selling due to forecasts for a fairly wet weekend in brazil the 
worlds secondlargest soybean producer after the united states 
south americas weather has been unusually dry during the ongoing 
planting period and has become a driving force in the us soybean 
futures market 
brazils weekend turned out to be drier than expected which 
should have given the markets a boost on monday analysts said 
but if one big house comes in and does something very very 
large that can have a big impact said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
frank kuba a chicagobased grain analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said some meteorologists were predicting more rain in 
south america this week and that those forecasts may have sparked 
the selloff 
our forecasters did not agree with that but the market got wind 
of some other forecasts he said 
slack export demand for soybeans and some light farmer selling 
also pressured the market but speculative selling was the dominant 
factor said mario balletto soybean market analyst with merrill 
lynch capital markets inc in new york 
i think you just saw the buyers on friday which was buying in 
case there were weather problems this week in brazil turning 
around and selling it back now that there is some rain in the 
forecast balletto said

public service co of colorado announced monday it 
plans to end nuclear operations by june 30 1990 at the 
problemridden fort st vrain power plant the nations only 
heliumcooled nuclear reactor 
a decision on whether to convert the plant to a fossil fuel 
facility will be made before the end of 1989 utility spokesman mark 
sieverts said 
dont leave the impression that the plant could be shut down 
tomorrow our plans are to run it through 1989 and into 1990 
sieverts said 
psc earlier had announced that if it could not find thirdparty 
assistance to continue operating the plant as a nuclear facility it 
would cease nuclear operations in 1991 or 1992 the plant is 
licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission to operate through 
2008 
sieverts said decommissioning of the nuclear power plant could 
take up to 55 years the initial work is just four to five years 
and then it sits for the dismantling process which would be about 55 
years down the road 
fort st vrain employs a unique heliumcooled reactor found in 
france but not elsewhere in the united states and the plant has had 
a troubled history since it began providing electricity in 1976 
the 330megawatt facility 35 miles north of denver never was 
allowed by the nrc to operate for any length of time at 100 percent 
of capacity because of problems that caused numerous shutdowns 
a spate of equipment problems in 1984 led to the plant being shut 
down for 22 months in july 1986 nrc commissioner james asselstine 
told a congressional subcommittee fort st vrain was one of the 10 
worstrun nuclear power plants in the nation 
in the fall of 1986 psc executives ordered a 101 million 
writedown of the facility and in october 1987 a fire in the turbine 
building caused millions of dollars worth of damage 
the plant has been shut down since last july for scheduled 
repairs on its four helium circulator units it is expected to 
resume electricity generation in january 
psc had said earlier it had three options for fort st vrains 
future shut down the plant and remove everything of use convert it 
to a coal or gasfired facility or find a third party interested 
in taking over the plant sieverts said the company is now left with 
the first two options 
how many of the 520 jobs associated with the nuclear power plant 
will be lost in 1990 has not yet been determined sieverts said 
in a prepared statement ro williams pscs senior vice 
president of nuclear operations said we will not be able to 
retain our entire plant workforce after we discontinue nuclear 
operations 
williams said he would meet with plant employees tuesday to 
outline the general plan 
once nuclear operations end defueling and decommission 
activities will begin officials said monday 
defueling involves removing fuel from the reactor core and 
shipping the spent fuel to a federal storage site 
decommissioning includes removing and shipping major reactor 
components and providing security for safe storage until the reactor 
can be dismantled and the facility released to unrestricted use 
we do have one fuel cell at the plant site that we do not plan 
to load into the reactor said sieverts were looking at the 
options of what to do with that unused fuel its a oneofakind 
technology and that fuel is also oneofakind fuel it would have 
to be reprocessed for use in other reactors he said

temporarily put aside their worries about rising interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 3148 to 
212376 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 12to7 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
929 issues up 540 down and 518 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 14466 million shares 
down from 12461 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
18593 million shares 
analysts said there was no specific news to spark mondays rally 
but that the markets oversold condition and recent performance were 
reason enough for many investors to go on a shopping spree 
theyre looking for an excuse to get back in said hugh 
johnson a market analyst at first albany corp when it seems 
oversold when it seems like pessimism is lopsided those who have 
been in the business instinctively want to get back in 
theyre looking for events that will serve as a catalyst to 
move the market on the upside he said 
the market was boosted by its own ability to rebound from 
negative news in particular the labor departments announcement 
friday that 463000 new jobs were created in november analysts said 
the governments figures indicated the economy continues to surge 
and they heightened fears that the federal reserve would raise its 
discount rate to control the economy and inflation 
but prices on wall street fell only moderately on friday and 
that encouraged traders to enter the market monday said alfred 
goldman a market analyst with ag edwards sons inc in st louis 
goldman said investors who were expecting a yearend stock rally 
might be doing some early shopping but the specter of rising 
interest rates has not vanished from wall street even if it was 
pushed into the background monday 
meanwhile the major sword of damocles hanging over the market 
is the fact that interest rates remain very high goldman said 
four major companies announced plans monday to offer their 
shareholders a chance to exchange more than 5 billion in stock for 
a new type of security that can be traded whole or broken into three 
parts 
the announcement was a catalyst for some of mondays buying 
johnson said 
the stocks of the four companies finished higher american 
express was up to 27 dow chemical rose 2 to 86 pfizer picked 
up 1 to close at 58 and sara lee which was up to 45 
transportation issues were among the big winners and lent

109 and amr rose 2 to 54 
other gainers included ibm up 1 to 120 general motors up 2 
to 85 and dupont which rose 1 to 82

the dollar generally strengthened late monday but 
fell against the british pound which surged on london press 
speculation that prime minister margaret thatchers government 
wanted a more expensive currency 
gold prices slipped in new york after rising in europe republic 
bank of new york quoted bullion at 42805 a troy ounce as of 4 pm 
est down from 43050 at the same time friday 
foreign exchange brokers said the dollars upward move came late 
in the day after it fell in european dealings staying in a narrow 
range all day they described trading as extremely light thereby 
exaggerating the influence of what few buyers and sellers were 
participating 
theres really been very little activity said david jacques 
senior trader on the corporate desk at the new york branch of 
britains barclays bank there were a couple of orders pushing it 
up 
traders said action was more exciting in the pound based on what 
they called british press speculation that the government was 
willing to see that currency rise by about 5 percent in value 
a more expensive pound theoretically would pressure britains 
exporters and make them less willing to grant what the government 
considers inflationary wage demands from workers the press accounts 
suggested traders interpreted this as a signal to buy pounds 
aggressively 
in london it cost 18690 to buy one pound up from 18597 late 
friday in new york the pound fetched 18683 up from 18655 and 
at times was trading above 187 the highest level in months the 
pounds strength raised the prospect of a 190 exchange rate soon 
traders said 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 12153 japanese yen down from 
12164 later in london the dollar traded lower at 12125 yen but 
strengthened in new york to 12156 yen vs 12120 yen late friday

gold traders said bullion prices fell in new york and rose in 
europe largely because of internal market influences and not outside 
news 
the new york commodity exchange quoted gold for current delivery

urban water system managers have taken limited 
action in response to the greenhouse effect say a panel of 
scientists who on monday urged the managers to seek scientific 
advice 
urban water managers say they are not going to act and you 
cant blame them until they see it with their own eyes or the 
professional bodies are in agreement said paul e waggoner 
cochairman of a committee on climate and the management of us 
water resources convened by the american association for the 
advancement of science 
waggoner is also director of the connecticut agricultural 
experiment station at new haven 
interviews with officials at nine water systems found only one 
minor action taken out of concern for the warming of the earth or 
the greenhouse effect the relocation of a discharge pipe in 
new york city 
among the committees recommendations were organizations of 
professional water resource managers should meet formally and 
regularly with scientists concerned with water and climate change 
the report also said practical managers must decide upon 
actions now with consequences several decades hence after some 
expected climatic changes have occurred 
the report did not identify the water system managers interviewed 
but said some of them were located in the district of columbia new 
york massachusetts indiana louisiana utah and arizona 
the scientists found in their interviews that overall the most 
immediate concern encountered was for the effect of a rising sea 
level on supply whereas effects of climate change on drainage 
health and disposal of waste evoked little concern 
the socalled greenhouse effect is the overall average warming of 
the earth because of the buildup of gases in the atmosphere that 
trap radiant heat of the planet that normally would be radiated out 
to space many scientists say it already has begun 
one effect of the process would be the expansion of the oceans 
and a rise in sea level simply from the warmer water 
the water resources panel used widely accepted computer 
predictions of an increase in average global temperature of three to 
eight degrees fahrenheit sometime in the next century 
these computer models predict an increase in worldwide annual 
average precipitation of 7 percent to 15 percent but there is 
little agreement among them on what could happen to particular 
regions the panel said regions could see average temperatures rise 
by as much as 18 degrees or fall by more than five degrees 
regionally precipitation could show anything from a 20 percent 
decrease to a 20 percent increase and runoff could rise 50 percent 
or fall 50 percent evaporation from vegetation and other sources 
could increase by 10 percent or fall by the same amount 
sea level increase could be between 4 inches and 3 feet the 
scientists said 
among other recommendations the panel called for measures to 
encourage markets in water rights emphasis on research on regional 
effects within the next decades as opposed to shorter or longer 
periods and awareness of the opportunities for conserving water and 
adding flexibility to water delivery systems

health secretary kenneth clarke on monday urged 
shoppers to carry on buying eggs despite 46 recent outbreaks of 
salmonella 
through october there have been 46 outbreaks of salmonella 
affecting 1000 people in england and wales traced to eggs 
according to clarke 
we accept there is a health hazard which we are all tackling 
clarke said during an appearance at the house of commons the 
average member of the public is not at risk at all 
however clarke also defended statements by edwina currie a 
junior minister who said most of the nations egg production was 
affected by salmonella 
she was right to stress the concern we feel about eggs and draw 
attention to the advice we have issued clarke said

first sod cut in 1929 by edsel ford the founders son on the site 
of the ford car plant at dagenham in east london the box was 
presented to henry ford ii when he visited dagenham in 1948

connotations said ms mchattie

upholstered fire fender estimated at 1870 was sold for 19500 
to a london dealer 
early american furniture that ford bought from new york dealer

the commercial banking industry easily 
could become obsolete without serious legislative reform the 
president of the american bankers association warned monday 
the future isnt all that bright said thomas p rideout 
also vice chairman of the first union national bank of north 
carolina in charlotte at the oregon bankers associations annual 
winter conference 
from 1977 to 1987 he said bankings share of financial assets 
held by financial institutions dropped from 37 percent to 29 percent 
in the same period large banks share of credit extended to 
nonfinancial corporations fell from 62 percent to 44 percent he 
said creditmarket debt held by banks for the same period also 
dropped from 41 percent to 35 percent 
deposit growth among competitors during the period far outpaced 
the 117 percent growth experienced by commercial banks with savings 
and loan deposits up 139 percent life insurance reserves up 191 
percent liabilities and capital of securities brokers and dealers 
up 1042 percent and money market mutual funds up 6450 percent 
rideout said 
technology has permitted easy entry into the financial services 
business by institutions outside the traditional banking industry 
he said and their services are expanding 
competitors are being allowed to engage in banking without 
meeting the supervisory standards imposed on banks or our same 
strict capital requirements which in fact are getting stricter as 
we head toward 1992 rideout said lax standards of course are 
one of the main causes behind the fslic federal savings amp loan 
insurance corp crisis today 
bank failures have risen he said from 42 in 1982 to 184 in 1987 
and 175 through october of this year the number of institutions 
identified as problem banks has risen from 300 in 1982 to 1575 
in 1987 and 1495 through may of this year 
rideout said association members should target legislators to 
push for reforming antiquated banking laws particularly those 
covering deposit insurance

several state lawmakers introduced 
bills monday to shore up the voterapproved measure to cut insurance 
rates that has been temporarily stayed by the state supreme court 
senate insurance committee chairman alan robbins unveiled a 
measure which he said would prevent insurers in the state from 
profiting as a result of any attempts to evade proposition 103 the 
bill sb103 threatens hefty financial fines for pullbacks from the 
market 
if whats happened with these companies withdrawing from the 
california market is allowed to snowball and if more companies 
then stop writing policies that is something we cannot do and 
something were not going to do robbins said 
in other states penalties have not stopped companies from 
leaving a market but they have discouraged new companies from 
coming in and picking up the business thats left behind said 
edward levy representing the association of california insurance 
companies 
senate leader david roberti a los angeles democrat said he was 
introducing a bill that would create an office in the state justice 
department to represent consumers with insurance problems during 
legal or administrative proceedings 
and sen cecil green a norwalk democrat said he will introduce 
a measure that would give the consumer advocates office the power 
to investigate and intervene on behalf of consumers when insurance 
companies are engaging in unfair methods of competition or deceptive 
practices 
lawmakers said the rush to introduce bills or sign on as 
coauthors of other legislators measures stems from their 
eagerness to implement the california electorates will expressed 
with the recent passage of proposition 103 
i think the vote of the people passing proposition 103 despite 
tens of millions of dollars being spent by the insurance industry to 
defeat it has placed a focus of public attention on the issue 
robbins said 
but the legislature may face an uphill battle as it attempts to 
pass significant insurancerelated legislation something it has 
been unable to do in recent years 
even if lawmakers are able to steer bills between the powerful 
lobbies of two perennial foes insurers and trial lawyers and gain 
twothirds votes the measures will still have to go to republican 
gov george deukmejian who opposed proposition 103 
after voters approved ratecutting proposition 103 several 
insurers announced they were limiting or ending their auto insurance 
business in california 
the state supreme court then stayed the initiative while 
considering its constitutionality and most of the companies said 
they would suspend plans while awaiting the outcome 
insurers are challenging several provisions of the measure 
including those that would roll back most rates to 20 percent below 
november 1987 levels and a requirement that would force companies to 
renew all policies unless the risk to the policyholder increases
