a navajo tribal judge wednesday began 
then recessed a hearing on temporary custody of an indian infant 
caught in a tug of war between the tribe and a nonindian couple 
who want to adopt her 
it was not immediately known why judge manuel watchman of navajo 
tribal childrens court recessed until friday the twohour closed 
hearing over 9monthold allyssa keetso 
however robert walters a lawyer appointed by the tribe as an 
advocate for the child came out an hour into the hearing and said 
he had been disqualified and was under a gag order the baby has 
no representation he said 
walters said he was ordered off the case after seeking dismissal 
of the tribal action that had brought the custody issue before the 
childrens court 
allyssa was born to an indian who wants the child to be adopted 
by rick and cheryl pitts of san jose calif but the tribe 
asserted its rights under federal law to decide adoptions of indian 
children and a california judge last week ordered the baby turned 
over to the tribe pending a final custody decision 
meanwhile the child has been in the pittses care at the 
reservation since sunday the couple was ordered to remain there 
until fridays hearing 
anslem roanhorse a navajo official with the tribes division of 
social welfare said however that the agency retained legal 
custody of allyssa 
watchman was expected during wednesdays hearing to begin 
deciding whether the baby should be adopted by the pittses with 
whom she has lived since birth or live on the reservation perhaps 
with her mothers parents 
the hearing which was closed because it is a juvenile 
proceeding was expected to address temporary custody with a 
hearing to be held later on a permanent arrangement 
patricia keetso 21 was unmarried pregnant and unable to 
support the child when the pittses contacted her through a 
newspaper advertisement she said she gave them allyssa to afford 
the child a better life 
the pittses both 33 were in the process of adopting allyssa 
with ms keetsos approval when the navajo tribal courts 
intervened 
barry a goodfield a psychologist advising the pittses accused 
tribal officials of being more worried about paperwork than the 
wellbeing of the child 
theres a power game being played in there and a baby is 
being used as a football goodfield said 
sam pitts rick pitts father said before the hearing were 
just hoping and praying that this hearing today will give us 
temporary custody while we continue to fight for adoption in tribal 
courts 
he held the baby before the hearing and said shes just 
frightened and just not her happy jolly self 
in a similar case last year a tribal judge in window rock 
awarded temporary custody of a 10yearold navajo boy to a 
nonindian couple who sought to adopt him pending a custody trial 
federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction to decide adoptions 
of indian children in certain instances navajo law places strong 
emphasis on extended family

a former policeman convicted of nine murders begged 
a jury over the vehement objections of his attorney to recommend 
the death penalty wednesday and the jury complied 
i am a soldier i accomplished my mission and i humbly ask you 
to give me the glory of ending my life and not send me to spend the 
rest of my days in state prison manuel pardo 31 told the dade 
circuit court jury 
im begging you to allow me to have a glorious end he said 
pardo a state highway patrolman and later a patrolman in the 
small dade county town of sweetwater until 1985 was convicted 
friday of shooting to death three women and six men over several 
months in 1986 
the jury recommended execution rather than life in prison pardo 
will be sentenced later by judge phillip knight who is not bound 
by the recommendation 
he had testified during the trial that he killed the nine 
because he wanted to rid the world of drug dealers prosecutors 
claimed he was a drug dealer himself and killed some of his victims 
during drug ripoffs 
pardos plea wednesday came over the objections of attorney 
ronald guralnick who put pardo on the stand to question him about 
his military record in an effort to persuade the jury to recommend 
a life sentence 
in asking to address the jury pardo told the judge he didnt 
want the panel to be biased by statements made by his parents 
who had asked the jury to spare his life and described him as a 
good son 
guralnick had argued at trial that pardo was insane at the time 
of the slayings but pardo himself denied it

pianistsinger michael feinstein says that he 
considers theater songs chums theater songs are lucky to have such 
a chum and champaion 
feinstein who has become the darling of the supperclub set in 
just two years added to his laurels on tuesday by becoming the 
cabaret toast of broadway he did it by singing mainly theater 
songs accompanying himself on piano in a straightforward smooth 
engaging style neither belting coy jazzy mannered nor gimmicky 
feinstein opened for a limited engagement through may 15 at 
broadways lyceum theater 
six musicians on a platform behind him during his nearly 
twoandahalf hour show enable feinstein occasionally to leave his 
piano bench and sing with a hand mike straddling a chair on a 
high stool or even atop his piano 
his voice is on the light side with a soft throb which makes 
his most effective vehicle the romantic ballad without phrasing to 
call attention to his articulation he manages to enunciate so well 
that nearly every word is understood even in unfamiliar or fast 
songs 
at first his presentation seems not far removed from bland but 
as the evening progresses the 30yearold performer turns an 
almost skeptical listener into an enthusiast with his easy command 
of the stage warmth and projection of sincere appreciation of the 
songs he plays and sings 
by the time hed been singing only a few minutes he took the 
audience into his mood while singing be careful its my heart 
and you keep coming back like a song he threw in a few 
novelties like lydia the tattooed lady and very uptempo numbers 
like looping the loop which was cut from the musical 
chicago 
he worked cataloging music for ira gershwin for six years until 
gershwin died in 1983 so his warmth singing the gershwin brothers 
last cowritten song our love is here to stay and their 
lovely never published will you remember me isnt surprising 
he also did a lengthy medley of songs by composer harry warren 
whom he also knew some of warrens songs with lyricist al dubin 
have been heard on broadway since 1980 in 42nd street 
feinstein dug in vocally for a big finish with irving berlins 
i love a piano all the more effective because he hadnt been 
overly emphatic before

negative campaigning would end he said he and jackson are very 
strong positive people we have a message of hope and optimism 
neither of us believes cutting up the other guy is a way to win 
elections or the presidency 
the massachusetts governor tried to look ahead to the fall 
campaign 
this fall george bush is going to be judged by a republican 
legacy of more red ink than all of the administrations from george 
washington to jimmy carter combined by pink slips for our workers 
golden parachuetes for high rollers and greenmail for sharp 
operators on wall street he said 
if im the nominee my friends the american people will be 
able to choose between a republican legacy of eight years of record 
deficits and my record of nine consecutive balanced budgets he 
said 
paul brountas his national campaign chairman told reporters 
traveling with dukakis back to new york that if he is the nominee

the japanese red army dormant for years after a 
decade as one of the worlds most feared terrorist groups is back 
in the news because of charges that its members bombed a uso club 
last week in naples italy 
the car bombing which killed an american and four italians was 
one of several recent reports of activity by the group whose 
operations in the 1970s included the lod airport massacre in israel 
a japanese man arrested april 12 on the new jersey turnpike with 
pipe bombs in his car is suspected of being a red army member the 
foreign ministry says 
last november a red army fugitive was arrested after arriving 
in japan with a ticket for seoul south korea site of the 1988 
summer olympics 
japanese experts and italian police believe the red armys 
current leader is fusako shigenobu 42yearold daughter of a tokyo 
insurance salesman who once worked as a bar hostess in tokyo to 
raise money for the terrorists 
she dropped out of college in the 1960s and later married as 
part of a plan to slip out of japan allegedly for a mission that 
led to the lod massacre in may 1972 two of the three attackers 
including her husband were among the 28 people killed 
police in japan said she sent letters from algeria before the 
lod attack telling friends i have become a member of a new 
guerrilla organization and we are preparing a historic fight at the 
end of may 
after the slaughter police said she wrote in a letter the 
heroic actions of the three japanese revolutionary fighters are 
highly valued 
her father sueo shigenobu was quoted in a 1972 newspaper 
interview as saying he and his daughter had argued heatedly about 
politics 
she would not change her stand on the sekigun red army 
principle of staging simultaneous uprisings all over the world 
he said 
ms shigenobu and others led an extremist splinter group away 
from the nowdefunct general federation of japanese students or 
zengakuren in 1968 
the goal of what they originally called the united red army was 
a simultaneous world revolution to destroy capitalism and 
imperialism 
masayuki takagi a commentator on japanese police and security 
matters said ms shigenobu probably brought in more funds as a bar 
hostess than were contributed by any of the red armys other 300 
members 
official crackdowns on the group increased in 1970 after nine 
red army men some armed with samurai swords hijacked a domestic 
japan air lines flight to pyongyang capital of communist north 
korea eight of the hijackers still live in north korea and the 
ninth is said to have died there last year 
in february 1971 ms shigenobu married tsuyoshi okudaira a 
25yearold leftist student who unlike his bride was not wanted 
by police soon after their marriage they got through airport 
security and flew to beirut 
takagi said ms shigenobu organized the mideast arab 
detachment of the red army that year the organization has nearly 
disappeared in japan since and is based in the middle east with 
close ties to arab terrorists 
ms shigenobu is said to be a close friend of leila khaled an 
arab woman involved in a several airplane hijackings in the 1970s 
the red army believed to number 30 to 40 people is intensely 
loyal to imprisoned comrades in the 1970s it hijacked several 
airliners and bargained successfully to free red army members 
kozo okamoto the survivor of the lod attack was sentenced to 
life in prison and ms shigenobu spoke several times of her hopes 
to get him released 
my thoughts have always been on freeing comrade okamoto the 
tokyo daily asahi quoted her as saying in a clandestine 1981 
interview she added however that the red army lacked the 
material or manpower to carry out the operation immediately 
in 1985 israel freed okamoto and 1100 other prisoners in an 
exchange for israeli soldiers held prisoner by arabs since then 
he and ms shigenobu have been photographed together in lebanon 
in a letter released by japanese police in 1984 she said she 
and red army comrades were all back in the front line of the 
bekaa valley of lebanon a syrianoccupied area long used for 
training arab and other guerrillas 
she said the red army had not abandoned violence as a means of 
fighting imperialism 
junzo okudaira the younger brother of her late husband has 
become one of the worlds most wanted men for attacks dating back 
to 1974 the year he slipped out of japan on a false passport 
according to akio ohno another commentator on police matters 
he was one of two red army members indicted for attacks on the 
us and british embassies in rome in june 1987 after last 
thursdays bombing italian police said he parked the 
explosivesladen car outside the uso club 
they said a witness reported seeing okudaira with fusako 
shigenobu nine hours before the explosion

iran may have challenged the us navy in 
air and sea battles in the persian gulf because it was caught off 
balance by an iraqi offensive in the faw peninsula and needed to 
claim it was under attack by america the great satan 
the iraqi ground attack aimed at regaining the faw peninsula at 
the gulfs northern end coincided with the heaviest fighting 
between the united states and iran in the gulf 
during mondays series of clashes in the southern part of the 
gulf iran broadcast a claim that us helicopters were helping 
iraqi troops the pentagon dened any us involvement in the ground 
fighting 
the united states attacked two iranian oil platforms to 
retaliate for damage caused to a us frigate by an iranian mine 
iranian ships then took on superior us forces in a series of 
engagements over several hours 
the americans disabled two iranian frigates and sunk or damaged 
four gunboats one american helicopter was missing and iran said it 
shot the aircraft down iran also claimed it sank a us ship 
during the fighting us navy officers in the gulf also 
reported iran launched at least five chinesemade silkworm 
missiles the pentagon said it could not confirm what kind of 
missiles were fired and adm william crowe chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said there was no evidence iran had fired 
silkworms 
whether they were silkworms or not it was the first time iran 
had launched missiles at us warships since the navy increased its 
presence in the persian gulf in july the use of missiles and the 
actions of iranian patrol boats showed that tehran was prepared to 
seriously tangle with the americans despite the us navys 
superior firepower 
western analysts believe the iranians apparently being pushed 
off the faw peninsula by iraq needed to claim that they were under 
attack by the united states as well as by the iraqis 
unless the iranians can pull a rabbit out of the hat they 
would seem to be in trouble said hansheino kopietz a middle 
east military analyst with the londonbased international institute 
for strategic affairs 
the developments of the last couple of days have thrown the 
whole gulf war wide open he said in an interview it looks 
like the iranians have been dislodged by the iraqis 
the iraqi offensive in faw captured by iranian revolutionary 
guards in february 1986 was a major surprise 
the iraqis strategy has been one of static defense since 1982 
when they were driven out of iran after invading in september 1980 
if iraq has recaptured the peninsula it will be a rare victory for 
baghdad and a psychological setback for tehran 
in those circumstances iran chose to take on the americans 
since july despite the occasional clash and bellicose rhetoric 
the iranians have gone out of their way to avoid a serious 
engagement with the us fleet with its missile destroyers and 
aircraft carriers that outgun anything the iranians have 
the united states keeps between 25 and 30 ships in the gulf 
region including destroyers cruisers frigates and mine sweepers 
jet aircraft from the carrier enterprise also attacked iranian 
ships in mondays fighting 
iran can muster four small frigates two of which were hit 
monday in addition iran has some vessels used as gunboats some 
patrol boats and is believed to have at least 50 speedboats 
40foot swedishbuilt boghammers 
paul beaver naval editor of janes defence weekly said the 
speedboats are basically recreational craft with large engines that 
iranian revolutionary guards have used to attack tankers with 
rocketpropelled grenades beaver said they also may be equipped 
with machineguns or mortars 
according to janes iran has eight f14 tomcat fighters 20 f4 
phantom figherbombers and as many as 40 f5 tigers all us built 
iran also has silkworm missiles as well as the mines that have 
damaged merchant shipping and last week blew a hole in the us 
frigate samuel b roberts injuring 10 crewmen 
the iraqis who have long sought to internationalize the gulf 
conflict to pressure iran to negotiate apparently launched the faw 
offensive in response to iranian thrusts in the northern part of 
the battlefront 
the iranians overran a large chunk of northeast iraq last month 
the 1986 seizure of faw has long stuck in the iraqis throat 
but despite repeated counterattacks they had been unable to oust 
the iranians 
the iranians have not admitted they have lost the faw peninsula 
but their allegations that the americans helped the iraqis 
indicates they have at least lost ground in faw

actor peter ustinov whose roles have ranged from 
babar the elephant to romes mad emperor nero is now playing 
beethovens ghost before packed houses in west berlin 
the play beethovens tenth was written by ustinov and has 
been performed in the united states and in britain however its 
west berlin debut at the schiller theater marks the first time 
ustinov has delivered his lines in german 
ustinov who turned 67 on april 16 admits that speaking german 
is his biggest challenge in the performance 
for me every night at the schiller is a premiere he said 
in a recent interview german is a difficult language it forces 
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that im not used 
too im constantly in danger of getting stuck 
for the interview ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but 
cautiously enunciated german 
the play opened in west berlin in january and has been sold out 
ever since more than 40000 people are expected to see the 
production before its scheduled april 30 closing gisela huwe a 
theater spokeswoman said 
beethovens tenth is one of the greatest successes in the 
40year history of the schiller huwe said of the twoact play 
written by ustinov 
much of the plays action concentrates on efforts by a fictional 
london music critic named stephen winter to imagine how beethovens 
10th symphony might have sounded it also focuses on his often 
stormy relations with his son pascal who composes modern 
symphonies which winter has no use for 
a viennese aupair girl named irmgard who loves beethoven and 
pascal manages to wake the composer from the dead the composer 
rings the doorbell and strides with long hair flowing across the 
stage 
with the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor 
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first 
time 
ludwig van beethovens last completed symphony is his ninth 
the choral music researchers however say they have discovered 
sketches for an unfinished symphony possibly a 10th dated after 
completion of his ninth symphony and before his death in 1827 
in ustinovs play the audience never learns how the 10th 
symphony really sounded but the resurrected genius helps bring the 
feuding winter family closer together 
critics say ustinovs often deliberate german delivery adds to 
the performance increasing audience empathy to the character of 
beethoven who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a 
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave 
ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the west berlin 
stage 
the actor is in direct contact with the audience here he 
said the people are very warmhearted 
ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage 
and screen actor and in recent years has become best known for his 
portrayal of agatha christies belgian sleuth hercule poirot 
he has written several other plays a collection of short 
stories and a novel 
in film he gained prominence for his portrayal of nero in 
mervyn le roys 1951 hollywood epic quo vadis he is also 
known as the voice of babar the elephant a popular childrens book 
character created by the late french author jean de brunhoff

nbc which won the ratings for the third 
straight season by a bigger margin than ever is looking to next 
season when a writers strike could keep its rivals in reruns 
while it covers the olympics 
nbc topped off the season by winning the final week even though 
the 60th annual academy awards on abc was the weeks no 1 show 
according to ac nielsen co figures tuesday 
for the week nbc had an average rating of 139 abc 135 and 
cbs 118 the rating is a percentage of the nations 886 million 
homes with television 
if the 6weekold writers strike isnt settled soon network 
executives warn there wont be scripts for most of the new 
seasons shows and once it is settled quality might suffer in 
the rush to get shows ready 
th strike apparently poses the least problem for nbc which 
successfully bid a 300 million base price to cover the 
traditionally highrated summer olympics a sum that may turn out 
to be a better investment that nbc ever imagined 
gerald jaffe nbcs vice president for research projects said 
tuesday that advertising interest in the olympics is picking up 
already 
the longterm effects of a late season could hurt the three 
networks their combined share of the viewing audience is down 
only the extent is at issue because of controversy over the new 
ratings system 
nielsen ratings for the 198788 season showed the threenetwork 
average down 9 percent from last year jaffe disputed that figure 
saying he compared more extensive localmarket surveys and found a 
network decline of 3 percent 
he attributed the discrepancy to inaccuracies in nielsens new 
peoplemeter audience measurement system 
last week cbs released preliminary figures from a competing 
ratings company agb that showed cbs slightly ahead of abc instead 
of last but agb data didnt dispute the threenetwork drop 
cbs has estimated that the lower peoplemeter figures will cost 
the networks a combined 50 million in advertising revenues 
the networks have hired a consulting firm to study the new 
ratings system said bill rubens nbc vice president for research 
the results are expected this summer 
the networks annually promote the new fall season to bring 
viewers back but if they have to extend summer reruns more 
viewers will presumably seek alternatives and that could change 
viewing habits permanently 
nbcs season average primetime rating was 160 abc which had 
been third in the ratings for three years running eked out second 
with a 137 thanks to the world series super bowl and winter 
olympics cbs was third for the first time ever with 135 
nbc had never won a season before 198586 
the cosby show was the no 1rated show for the 
thirdstraight year followed by its spinoff a different 
world nbcs cheers and golden girls abcs growing 
pains whos the boss nbcs night court cbs 60 
minutes and murder she wrote and abcs new show the 
wonder years 
of the two new shows that made the top 10 both were 
significantly helped by their popular leadins a different 
world by cosby and wonder years by whos the boss 
the only other new shows to make even the top 30 were nbcs my 
two dads at 21st in the heat of the night at 19th and 
aarons way at 30th the latter two premiered late in the 
season 
despite the lackluster performance by the new shows jaffe 
predicted a third will be renewed following the pattern of 
previous years 
the networks have parted company with bigevent multipart 
miniseries of the 12 miniseries last year all but two were 
twoparters the toprated elvis and me on abc had rating of 
245 
the ann jillian story on nbc was the toprated tv movie with 
238 
news ratings are measured quarterly not by season but 
beginning with the traditional television season in september when 
nielsen converted to the people meters nbc nightly news 
dropped into a thirdplace slump last week the cbs evening 
news was no 1 with a 101 and 21 share narrowly edging abcs 
world news tonight with 99 and 20 nbc nightly news had an 
87 and 18 
the share is a percentage of sets in use

a west german financier accused of 
defrauding volkswagen out of an estimated 285 million is eligible 
for extradition a us magistrate has ruled 
the extradition of joachim schmidt 38 was upheld tuesday 
following an hourlong hearing before us magistrate ronald rose 
who dismissed technical objections filed by schmidts american 
attorneys 
rose said he would sign an order monday to certify schmidts 
transfer to germany 
schmidt apparently fled to the united states after volkswagen 
discovered he had engineered a massive fraud through currency 
futures purchased by the west german automaker prosecutors said 
the fbi arrested the financier in november 1987 when he was 
living in a hollywood apartment under an assumed name authorities

it wasnt screaming fans or the intrusive media 
that were the greatest threat to michael jackson it was something 
more insidious more heinous more vicious 
zits 
i became subconsciously scarred by this experience with my 
skin he writes in his new autobiography moonwalk which 
doubleday is publishing this week 
i got very shy and became embarrassed to meet people because 
my complexion was so bad it really seemed that the more i looked 
in a mirror the worse the pimples got my appearance began to 
depress me the effect on me was so bad that it messed up my 
whole personality 
the 29yearold rock megastar was about 14 when the vicissitudes 
of adolescence assaulted him he had been vigorously performing 
with his older brothers marlon tito jackie and jermaine as the 
jackson 5 since he was 5 
in those days the biggest struggle was right there in my 
mirror to a great degree my identity as a person was tied to my 
identity as a celebrity 
in more recent years what the reclusive performer has seen in 
the mirror bears little resemblance to the brownskinned kid with 
the wide nose and airy afro 
in his autobiography jackson admits to having two nose jobs and 
a chin cleft made however he said he has not had his cheeks or 
eyes altered or a skin peel or dermabrasion to lighten his 
complexion 
all of these charges are ridiculous he writes i dont 
care what anyone else says its my face and i know it 
what does my face have to do with my music or my dancing 
jackson wrote his book with an assist from doubleday editor 
shaye areheart 
he was wonderful very enthusiastic she said in an 
interview hes just a lot of fun to be around he loves life and 
is very enthusiastic about projects he gets involved with he 
doesnt do anything he doesnt feel good about hes a very hard 
worker 
michael jackson is the seventh of nine children born to joseph 
and katherine jackson in gary ind he began performing as lead 
singer with the jackson 5 which released 26 albums for motown and 
epic 
their father a steelmill worker who played with a rhythm and 
blues band was extremely strict with the young performers 
i wasnt forced into this business jackson writes i did 
it because i enjoyed it and because it was as natural to me as 
drawing a breath and exhaling it i did it because i was compelled 
to do it not by parents or family but by my own inner life in the 
world of music 
he hated the cbstv variety series the jacksons had in 197677 
because they had to dress in ridiculous outfits and perform 
stupid comedy routines to canned laughter it was all so fake 
he didnt want to do the 1984 victory tour with his brothers 
at a time when his solo career was soaring 
he was reluctant to do the motown 25 tv special because of 
his negative feelings about television but reconsidered once he 
was allowed to perform billie jean a nonmotown hit 
when i feel that something is not right i have to speak up 
jackson says i know most people dont think of me as tough or 
strongwilled but thats just because they dont know me 
the late fred astaire to whom moonwalk is dedicated 
called jackson after the show and said 
youre a hell of a mover man you really put them on their 
asses last night 
youre an angry dancer im the same way i used to do the 
same thing with my cane 
it was the greatest compliment i had ever received in my life 
and the only one i had ever wanted to believe jackson said 
making his critically acclaimed and highly successful 1979 solo 
lp off the wall was one of the most difficult periods of his 
life jackson said 
i had very few close friends at the time and felt very 
isolated i was so lonely that i used to walk through my 
neighborhood hoping id run into somebody i could talk to and 
perhaps become friends with i wanted to run into somebody who 
would be my friend because they liked me and needed a friend too 
not because i was who i am 
hes says hes learned to cope with depression and loneliness 
since then but nevertheless still craves privacy and so shutters 
his eyes with dark glasses it may be considered strange i 
know but i like my privacy

segregation at the seminole county jail has 
been ended by its new administrator who says racial tensions dont 
justify separating blacks and whites 
this is 1988 said duane rutledge who on monday put even 
numbers of white and black inmates in the previously segregated 
cellblocks if they cant live together then they will live 
in isolation 
two years ago capt jay leman whom rutledge succeeded in 
february created two allblack cellblocks and one allwhite one in 
the maximumsecurity area citing racial tension the state 
department of corrections condoned the move 
guards had complained about the policy saying white guards 
feared entering the allblack cellblocks and black guards feared 
the allwhite cellblock

a task force recommendation that supreme court 
nominees no longer testify openly at confirmation hearings is 
drawing fire even from conservatives who complained about the 
handling of robert h borks unsuccessful nomination 
its a nice idea in theory but practically it wont work 
sen orrin g hatch rutah said tuesday after the task force on 
judicial selection issued a report recommending that supreme court 
nominees no longer testify in public before the senate judiciary 
committee 
the privately financed committee of lawyers headed by former 
gov hugh carey of new york concluded that the confirmation 
process has become dangerously close to looking like the electoral 
process 
but hatch a member of the judiciary committee said any nominee 
who refused to testify would almost certainly be rejected by the 
committee and by the full senate because the testimony has become 
a matter of custom and practice 
still he added there should not be a political process like 
in the bork case 
the report said senate review of supreme court nominees has 
become very much a national referendum on the appointment with 
media campaigns polling techniques and political rhetoric that 
distract attention from and sometimes completely distort the 
legal qualifications of the nominee 
television also came in for criticism in the study which said 
tv coverage of the hearings invited abuse of the confirmation 
process 
the report said the white house the department of justice 
senators witnesses and even nominees now seem tempted to use 
televised hearings as a forum for other purposes ranging from 
selfpromotion to mobilizing special interest groups in order to 
influence public opinion 
the fight over borks nomination was waged not only in the 
hearing room but in newspaper ads television commercials and news 
conferences 
the nominee received an unfavorable recommendation from the 
judiciary committee and was defeated by the senate last october 
5842 
critics attacked borks narrow reading of constitutional 
protections calling him anticivil rights anticonsumer and 
against equal rights for women 
supporters accused opponents of distorting his record and 
painted the nominee as a compassionate man who believed that 
judicial rulings should track the intent of the constitutions 
framers 
sen charles e grassley riowa said the public relations 
blitz that bork endured should not be repeated but the added that 
the reports suggestion of ending a nominees testimony wouldnt 
fly 
we ought to have public dialogue he said 
sen arlen specter of pennsylvania a republican who voted 
against bork called the report an overreaction to the bork 
proceedings 
any supreme court nominee who refused to appear before the 
judiciary committee would not be cleared by the committee he 
said 
the panel did not rule out informal interviews with nominees so 
that senators could assess their judicial temperament and legal 
qualifications 
but specter said this would shut out the public which has a 
right to know how the process is working and whether the public 
interest is protected grassley and specter both sit on the 
judiciary committee as well 
the report was commissioned by the twentieth century fund a 
private foundation that finances studies of public policy issues 
the recommendation drew dissents from washington attorneys and 
former carter administration officials lloyd cutler and joseph 
califano 
supreme court nominees should testify before the senate and 
they should get all the publicity that modern communications can 
provide said califano who was secretary of health education 
and welfare in the carter administration 
cutler was carters white house counsel 
the report noted that until the 1925 testimony of harlan f 
stone no supreme court nominee had ever appeared as a witness 
during confirmation proceedings in 1939 felix frankfurter became 
the second witness to testify before his confirmation 
besides carey members of the panel were former new york mayor 
robert f wagner washington attorney michael m uhlmann 
georgetown university professor walter berns university of chicago 
law professor philip b kurland and nicholas j spaeth attorney 
general of north dakota 
kurland who advised the senate judiciary committees chairman 
sen joseph biden ddel during the bork hearings dissented from 
the conclusion that confirmation proceedings had become unduly 
politicized

federal inspectors have examined almost all of 
eastern airlines 267 jets and found most in compliance with safety 
rules but say they will continue ramp inspections and look at many 
of the aircraft again 
the faa said the 508 inspections at airports around the country 
have covered all but 11 of easterns planes and found 43 cases in 
which jets had to be taken out of service to correct problems in 
33 of the cases flights were delayed as a result the agency said 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said tuesday he could not predict 
precisely when the planebyplane inspections would conclude he 
said they would continue even after each of easterns jets is 
examined at least once possibly another several weeks 
the faa last week said it wanted to conclude the review of 
eastern and analyze its findings within 30 days 
meanwhile in a similar inspection at continental airlines 
which like eastern is owned by texas air corp faa inspectors 
found one plane out of 15 examined in the first 24 hours that 
needed to be taken out of service 
one of the continental jets engines was found to be damaged 
from a foreign object buckhorn said adding that it is 
conceivable that the airline might have taken the plane from 
service even if no faa inspector were present 
the deficiencies found with the 43 eastern plans that briefly 
were sidelined included instances of leaking fuel and aircraft 
corrosion and one case in which 19 rivets were found to have 
broken through an airplanes skin buckhorn said 
philip bakes president of eastern characterized these problems 
as not unusual in most every case the plane would have been 
taken out of service even if there had been no faa inspector 
present he said tuesday at a news conference 
every day planes are being taken out of service as a normal 
part of an airlines operation he suggested 
frank lorenzo chairman of texas air corp the parent company 
of both eastern and continental told reporters that he welcomed 
the federal inspections because they will demonstrate once and 
for all that continental and eastern are safe as safe as any 
major airline 
but in miami charles bryan leader of the eastern machinists 
union criticized the faa ramp inspection as a whitewash and 
charged that some of the faa inspectors were only looking at log 
books without inspecting the aircraft he also said faa inspectors 
should go into the shops to observe maintenance of equipment 
it may be the old fox watching the chicken house said bryan 
lorenzo and bakes reiterated the airlines past charges that 
much of the turmoil about safety at both eastern and continental 
stems from the airlines ongoing battles with organized labor 
especially bryans machinists union 
what is at issue is how far a union is permitted to go by 
weakening a company through harassment and misinformation 
said lorenzo 
bakes blamed much of easterns problems on a slanderous safety 
campaign by the unions which he said are determined to block 
attempts by the airline to reduce labor costs 
he said the company would continue to push for a reduction of 
costs including demands for wage concessions from the machinists 
union the airline and the union have been involved in negotiations 
since the mechanics contract expired last december 
lorenzo and bakes promised to continue pushing for concessions 
from the unions saying that was the only way to make eastern 
profitable lorenzo said he had no interest in selling eastern and 
accused the unions of waging a campaign of misinformation to 
depress eastern stock

federal agencies with two notable exceptions 
are generally complying with the sunshine law requiring them to 
conduct important business in meetings open to the public a senate 
hearing was told 
the two persistent offenders were identified tuesday as the 
nuclear regulatory commission and the equal employment opportunity 
commission both were accused of violating the spirit if not the 
letter of the law intended to expose government decisionmaking 
to closer public scrutiny 
sen lawton chiles dfla chief sponsor of the 1976 law said 
recent congressional surveys reinforce his belief that on 
balance agencies are making efforts to comply with the law 
but peter prichard senior news editor at usa today told a 
senate governmental affairs subcommittee headed by chiles that 
the law does not work as well as it might 
prichard who represented the american society of newspaper 
editors and the american newspaper publishers association said the 
law seems to have encouraged agencies to conduct wellscripted 
meetings to fulfill the formalities of the law and to erect 
memorials to decisions that actually occurred outside the public 
view 
the law which has no enforcement provisions covers about 50 
independent agencies but none of the cabinet agencies headed by a 
single administrator in addition discussions of such sensitive 
issues as litigation national security and personnel matters are 
exempt 
the nrc was singled out for criticism at tuesdays hearing by 
ellyn r weiss general counsel for the union of concerned 
scientists who said there is a prevailing climate of public 
phobia at the nuclear agency 
the sun has not shone much over the nuclear regulatory 
commission she said nrc has for the past seven years mounted 
a substantial and acrosstheboard assault on public participation 
in its decisionmaking 
nrc spokeswoman sue gagner refused to comment on ms weiss 
allegations 
claudia withers of the womens legal defense fund a nonprofit 
group that seeks elimination of sex discrimination in employment 
and family law made a similar complaint about the eeoc the 
independent agency responsible for enforcing antidiscrimination 
laws 
ms withers said that after attending weekly agency meetings for 
several months in 1985 it became clear to us that the eeoc 
conducted little business of any real substance at its public 
sessions and that detailed discussions actually took place 
privately 
she and ms weiss said commissioners at both agencies evaded the 
laws requirements by voting privately on policy memos circulated 
among themselves and then holding a public meeting simply to 
announce their decisions 
ms withers said the eeoc may adhere to the letter of the 
sunshine act but sorely tests its spirit 
deborah graham the eeocs chief spokeswoman denied ms 
withers charges of secret decisionmaking and said the agency 
holds weekly meetings with advance notice to the public 
ms graham said however that the number of closed eeoc 
meetings has grown since september 1984 that is when the full 
commission assumed responsibility from staff lawyers for handling 
every discrimination dispute that called for possible court action 
she said

michael dukakis handed jesse jackson a setback 
in new york on tuesday from which he might not recover but the 
massachusetts governor did it without alienating jacksons black 
supporters 
dukakis managed to stay above the fray while albert gore jr and 
new york mayor edward koch battered jackson thus keeping open the 
channels of communication to the civil rights leader and his core 
black constituency 
were both very strong positive people dukakis said on abc 
we have a message of hope and optimism neither of us believes 
cutting up the other guy is a way to win elections or the 
presidency 
during one harlem campaign stop dukakis was criticized for 
giving up the black vote to jackson exit polls showed that the 
black vote went overwhelmingly for jackson as expected those 
polls also showed however that many blacks felt dukakis wasnt 
sensitive to their needs 
tennessee sen albert gore jr on the other hand was the first 
democratic candidate to go directly after jackson talking about 
the need to elect a president not a preacher 
then gore picked up the endorsement of koch and the attacks now 
coming from koch became more strident jews would have to be 
crazy to vote for jackson and jackson couldnt be trusted to 
tell the truth under stress said koch 
gore who had begun to soften his attacks on jackson as the new 
york campaign wound down and the tennessee senator sensed his 
coming defeat eventually said koch was speaking for himself 
dukakis new york victory was impressive in its own right in 
collecting about 50 percent of the vote dukakis bettered walter 
mondales 44 percent win in 1984 jackson running about even with 
dukakis in new york city finished about 10 percentage points 
higher than four years ago when he won 26 percent of the new york 
vote

of us troops from global hotspots such as the persian gulf says 
an influential senator on national security issues 
i think it needs to be substantially revised said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
nunn said he plans to propose revisions of the 1973 law within 
the next several weeks but said his proposal would not affect the 
current persian gulf policy 
im just in the process of drafting it now said nunn who 
explained he wants to discuss his proposals with senate majority 
leader robert byrd dwva and administration officials 
president reagan has refused to invoke the war powers act for 
his persian gulf policy but he has consulted with congressional 
leaders 
the act requires a report from the white house within 48 hours 
after us troops are sent into areas of imminent hostilities 
under some circumstances those forces would have to be withdrawn 
within 60 days unless congress votes to permit them to remain 
nunn said the automatic withdrawal provision ought to be 
removed nunn has objected to the timetables because they are 
arbitrary congress can circumvent them by using its power over the 
pursestrings and they shift the focus of the law away from 
consultations between the president and congress 
he also plans to propose a leadership council of unnamed senior 
congressional leaders who would consult with the president 
regularly about national security issues 
you cannot have 435 congressmen and 100 senators all be 
informed nunn said but you can have a leadership council and 
then it becomes the job of congressional leaders to inform the 
house and senate 
nunn said the law contains no enforcement provision and thus 
congress has no effective response to reagans refusal to invoke 
the law 
the law is on the books and it ought to either be obeyed or 
declared unconstitutional nunn said but if the president 
decides hes not going to follow the law theres nothing congress 
can do 
congress has the option of passing a bill to invoke the war 
powers act he said but reagan could veto that bill and a 
twothirds vote of the house and senate would then have to override 
the veto to trigger the law 
reagan was widely praised on capitol hill this week for telling 
house and senate leaders about the planned us attacks on iranian 
oil platforms before the attacks started 
but some senators still said the war powers act should be 
invoked arguing that the last usiran clash meets the 
requirements of the bill 
if this situation doesnt trigger war powers nothing will 
said sen brock adams dwash one of the chief senate critics of 
reagans refusal to invoke the law 
reagan as have all previous presidents contends that the act 
is an unconstitutional limit on his authority to conduct foreign 
policy 
last summer a group of 115 legislators most of them house 
democrats sued in federal court here to seek an order requiring 
reagan to trigger the law the suit was dismissed on grounds that 
it was a political dispute and thus outside the reach of the 
judiciary but the legislators are appealing that ruling 
the only time that congress has succeeded in invoking the war 
powers law was 1983 when us marines were sent into beirut as 
part of an international peacekeeping force congress extended the 
deployment deadline to 18 months but the marines were withdrawn 
three months after 241 servicemen most of them marines were 
killed by a suicide truck bomber

advocates of closing washingtons revolving 
door are optimistic following senate approval of a measure to 
restrict lobbying by former members of congress and top executive 
branch officials 
i think we stand a chance in the house sen strom thurmond 
rsc said tuesday after voicevote senate passage of a bill that 
includes the first prohibitions on lobbying by former senators and 
representatives 
ann mcbride senior vice president of common cause the 
selfdescribed citizens lobby said that the real question now 
is what happens in the house whether the bill becomes law rests 
with the house democratic leadership 
the ethical issue of postemployment lobbying is scheduled for 
its first recent house airing on thursday at a hearing by the 
judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental 
relations 
moving over from the senate is a compromise package by thurmond 
and sen howard metzenbaum dohio that represents the senates 
response to the recent influenceselling activities of michael 
deaver and lyn nofziger after they left toplevel posts in the 
reagan white house 
nofziger has been convicted of illegal lobbying while deaver has 
been convicted of perjury during an investigation into his lobbying 
activities 
we want to change the way things operate in this city said 
metzenbaum lobbyists should be paid for what they know not who 
they know 
a 10yearold ethics law makes it a crime for an executive 
branch official to lobby his or her former agency within a year of 
leaving the agency critics say rulings by the office of government 
ethics have weakened the law 
congress as it has done for many laws exempted itself from 
coverage 
to win easy senate approval thurmond and metzenbaum scrapped 
their plan to ban any lobbying by lawmakers and the highest 
executive branch officials cabinet secretaries their deputies 
and toplevel white house people for a year after they leave 
office 
instead they accepted an amendment by sen warren rudman 
rnh that would leave former senators and representatives free 
to lobby all but congress and the highest levels of the executive 
branch 
still the rudman amendment would impose some new restrictions 
top executive branch officials including generals and admirals 
could not lobby the executive branch or members of congress for a 
year however they could attempt to influence congressional 
staffers who do much of the nutsandbolts work on capitol hill 
former lawmakers would be barred from lobbying congress and top 
executive branch officials for a year still open however would 
be a vast governmental territory assistant cabinet secretaries 
career bureaucrats and heads of independent and regulatory agencies 
the bill would broaden the current law by putting a years 
lobbying restriction on postemployment activities by lower ranking 
political appointees and congressional staffers and career 
bureaucrats earning more than 64397 a year 
an 18month ban would be imposed on leaving a federal job and 
going to work for a foreign government the ban would cover 
legislative and executive branch people making more than 64397 
except for former members of congress 
the legislation would make violations a felony with a top 
penalty of five years in prison and a 250000 fine up from the 
present two years and 10000 
thurmond said he took the rudman amendment out of a spirit of 
compromise because he wanted to send a strong message to the 
house 
these changes are acceptable he said they do not 
substantially weaken the bill 
the senate added several other amendments 
one sponsored by sen mitch mcconnell rky would prohibit a 
congressional candidate from soliciting funds after an election to 
pay off personal or bank loans to the candidates campaign 
another rudman amendment would prohibit senators and 
representatives from holding outside jobs such as working in a 
law firm while serving in congress the senate has a rule against 
this the house doesnt 
a third rudman amendment would repeal the law that allows 
members of congress elected before 1980 to keep excess campaign 
funds for personal use so long as they pay income tax on the money

iran has suffered its two most serious defeats 
of the eightyear iraniraq war losing a onesided engagement with 
the us navy and reportedly being knocked off the faw peninsula by 
the smaller iraqi army 
despite the setbacks many us analysts do not believe that 
iran is in danger of defeat at the hands of iraq 
but they are divided over why iran risked battle with the 
worlds mightiest navy and why the united states apparently sought 
confrontation with iran after a monthslong lull in the land and 
tanker wars in gulf 
the naval battle in the persian gulf on monday dealt a heavy 
blow to any possible improvement in relations between iran and the 
united states and it suggests that the reagan administration may 
have badly miscalculated the iranian reaction to what us 
officials called a measured appropriate response to a mining 
attack on an american warship last week 
president reagan defending the us military action said 
tuesday that we consider the matter closed 
many analysts in and out of government believed it unlikely that 
iran would let the issue die and predicted more terrorist attacks 
in the gulf and elsewhere 
given the renewed antagonism between washington and tehran it 
appeared unlikely that moscow would ease its objections to a united 
nations embargo on arms sales to iran and iraq a us initiative 
designed to broaden international efforts to stop the fighting 
the democratic chairman of the senate armed services committee 
sen sam nunn of georgia warned that weve got to make sure that 
we do not turn this into a usiranian war a situation the un 
embargo was designed to counter 
in the iranian view said georgetown university professor 
anthony cordesman the united states seems to be the real force 
that is driving them from victory in the iraniraq war 
the iranian decision to engage us forces may have been 
calculated to inflict heavy casualties on the americans and thereby 
induce congress to invoke the war powers act possibly forcing the 
withdrawal of american ships from the persian gulf 
navy officers said that although irans navy is small it has 
modern weapons that could sink an unwary or unlucky us ship 
heavy us casualties said cordesman could have provoked loud 
cries on capitol hill for the war powers act passed after the 
vietnam war to give congress 60 or at most 90 days to vote 
whether to leave us forces in a war zone 
in ordering retaliatory strikes against two iranian oil 
platforms us war planners misjudged the mood in iran said james 
bill author of a new book on usiranian relations the eagle 
and the lion 
we are dealing with a country that is desperate and 
cornered said bill 
a year ago administration analysts worried that iraq could lose 
the war opening the way to iranian domination of the arab states 
bordering the gulf 
last july us naval vessels began to escort reflagged kuwaiti 
tankers in and out of the gulf in what administration officials 
described as an effort to protect international shipping 
many analysts outside the administration viewed the reflagging 
as an effort to bolster iraq and in irans view that has been the 
effect as iraq has enjoyed subsequent military successes and iran 
has suffered setbacks 
the regime of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini failed to mount its 
annual kerbala offensive on the southern front with iraq this 
winter and there have been numerous reports of problems in 
recruiting martyrs for the war 
iran has been on the losing end of an exchange of missiles the 
war of the cities that has inflicted limited damage on the 
iraqi capital of baghdad but reportedly terrorized the iranian 
capital of tehran and holy city of qom 
iran was somewhat successful on the northern front taking some 
towns in kurdistan but was shocked by an alleged iraqi chemical 
attack in that region this winter 
iranian media have reported that us helicopters were flying 
air support for iraqi ground forces involved in retaking the faw 
peninsula allegations that were denied by us officials 
the iranians think that the faw and the us naval attacks 
were worked out in advance said bill a specialist in iranian 
affairs and professor at william and mary college in williamsburg 
va 
strategically this is going to set back usiranian 
relations for 30 to 40 years said bill we need to take a 
longrange strategic view not a shortrange tactical view

a presidential veto of the massive trade bill 
now before congress wouldnt directly affect the freetrade 
agreement between the united states and canada according to 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
theres nothing that tells me that theyre connected lyng 
said tuesday if there is a veto of the sweeping trade bill 
president reagans veto message would describe some reasons that 
have nothing whatsoever to do with the free trade agreement with 
canada as far as i can see 
lawmakers are near final action on the 1000page trade bill 
but there have been veto threats over parts the administration find 
objectionable including a provision that would require 60day 
notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the uscanada trade pact was signed jan 2 but still requires 
approval by the canadian parliament and the us congress if 
approved the treaty will take effect jan 1 1989 and will 
gradually eliminate all tariffs between the two countries and 
address nontariff barriers 
according to the agriculture department uscanada trade was 
about 124 billion in 1986 of which 46 billion was agricultural 
lyng appeared at a news conference with canadian minister of 
agriculture john wise following private discussions wise said he 
was pleased by lyngs view of the trade bill and said there is 
the absolute need and the absolute necessity for us to join 
forces in ongoing global talks under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt 
in fact i think were it not for the leadership taken by 
canada and the united states we probably wouldnt be at the 
stage that we are now in the uruguay round of multinational trade 
negotiations wise said 
both he and lyng said the uscanada freetrade agreement would 
help push the cause of global reform 
it would be extremely helpful i think to both of us in 
sending a very legitimate and a very concrete message to our other 
trading partners particularly at gatt wise said 
in a joint statement later the two agricultural leaders pledged 
to work together to ensure that the organization for economic 
cooperation and development ministerial meeting in may and the 
toronto economic summit in june provide the necessary political 
impetus for a midterm review of the uruguay round next december

large soviet purchases of wheat at subsidized 
prices have helped increase grain exports and brighten financial 
prospects for american farmers says an agriculture department 
report 
overall the soviet unions total grain imports are at a 
threeyear high despite bumper harvests the last two seasons the 
departments economic research service said tuesday 
the gain is primarily from larger wheat purchases the 
report said aided by the export enhancement program and soviet 
demand for millingquality wheat the us share of import volume 
is likely to rise to about half this year up from less than 1 
percent in 198586 
the soviet union is expected to import 32 million metric tons of 
total grain from all foreign sources in the international marketing 
year that runs through june 30 1988 that would be the most since 
imports were a record 555 million tons in 198485 
the wheat share of this years imports is estimated at 22 
million tons the most since 198485 when wheat rose to 281 
million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
soviet wheat imports dropped sharply in 198586 to 157 million 
tons when the us share declined to a trickle 
under a fiveyear agreement the soviet union is committed to 
buy at least 4 million of wheat and 4 million tons of corn 
annually the pact expires this sept 30 and covers the year that 
began last oct 1 
although the agreement year is three months out of step with the 
july 1june 30 marketing year it does show a similar trend in 
soviet grain imports 
for example soviet wheat purchases fell short of the pacts 
minimum in 198485 when they dropped to 29 million tons and in 
198586 when they were only 200000 tons that coincided with the 
less than 1 percent us share cited in the latest report 
the export enhancement progam or eep allows exporters to sell 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices and 
then collect free usdaowned commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
subsidized wheat sales to the soviet union began a year ago so 
far moscow has bought more than 88 million tons for delivery in 
198788 the final year of the grain pact 
in addition the soviets have bought 41 million tons of us 
corn 818400 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal 
for delivery through sept 30

the agriculture department is asking for 
public comments on how to design the 1989 wheat program 
one the biggest decisions will be whether to include an acreage 
reduction program or arp in next years program that involves 
how much of a farmers wheat base must be idled in order to qualify 
for 1989 price supports and other program benefits 
for the 1988 wheat crop as an example participating farmers 
had to reduce plantings by 275 percent of their wheat base 
the 1985 farm law requires usda to announce the following years 
wheat arp no later than june 1 officials said tuesday

the huge budget and trade deficits of the 
reagan administration will define the course of the nations 
economic policy for the remainder of the century and threaten 
real hardship if theres a recession the congressional joint 
economic committee said today 
the democraticcontrolled panel concludes in its annual review 
that the nation will struggle with the legacy of experiment in 
supplyside economics large spending increases for the military 
and an evergrowing debt 
the report credits last falls federal deficitreduction 
agreement between president reagan and congressional leaders as a 
major step toward controlling the record red ink which will 
approach 3 trillion by the end of the decade 
that amount is more than three times what it was when reagan 
took office 
the report calls the agreement only a first step noting 
that current deficit projections assume a stable economy should 
a recession occur the federal budget situation would deteriorate 
rapidly risking a serious disruption in financial markets 
the report hesitates to predict when a recession will occur 
given the mixed signals of 1987 it is hardly surprising that 
there is considerable uncertainty among the professional 
forecasters about the course of the economy in 1988 it said 
despite last years stock market collapse consumer spending has 
remained strong business and housing investment has been mixed 
previous forecasts of a significant drop in our net imports 
have not been borne out however as the competitive effects of the 
declining value of the dollar have been slow to be realized it 
said 
at the same time some forecasters are now beginning to raise 
questions about possible inflationary overheating of the economy 
it said 
the next president will have to find a new set of economic 
policies while adjusting to a greater international influence over 
the nations economy due in part to the large foreign debt during 
the 1980s the united states has gone from the worlds largest 
creditor to its largest debtor 
the reports recommendations include diligent attention to the 
domestic and foreign trade deficits along with prudent investment 
in education and job training 
these critical deficits were built up over a number of 
years it said they will not be rectified quickly 
the republicans on the committee dissenting from the democrats 
cite in their section of the report the extended strength of the 
current economic expansion now in its sixth year 
the foundation of any economy is a people at productive 
work they said never has the foundation of our economy been 
stronger

the federal aviation administration hopes to 
improve the performance of commuter airline flight crews in an 
effort to cut down on a spate of accidents since last year the 
agencys chief says 
allan mcartor told the house aviation subcommittee tuesday that 
a yearlong inspection of the nations commuter carriers will result 
in better crew training standards the first draft is expected by 
the fall he said 
i feel strongly that the most important steps we can take to 
improve safety are to enhance air crew performance mcartor said 
that will provide the largest safety benefits in the long run 
at the same hearing mcartors agency came in for criticism by a 
member of the national transportation safety board the federal 
agency that oversees accidents 
a sufficient margin of safety in air carrier operations can 
only be achieved through effective surveillance by faa 
inspectors john k lauber said however we continue to find 
evidence in our accident investigations of spotty and ineffective 
faa surveillance of commuter airlines 
commuter airlines which primarily rely upon small 
propellerdriven planes to serve small communities have grown 
rapidly in recent years the number of passengers they fly annually 
has grown from 129 million in 1980 to 272 million last year 
but after a recordlow accident rate in 1986 the commuters 
suffered 33 accidents and 58 fatalities last year the highest 
totals in the 1980s according to faa figures six commuter 
accidents and 22 deaths have occurred so far this year 
lauber said the growth of air travel has increased demand for 
pilots causing the major airlines to hire fliers away from the 
smaller commuter carriers this forces the commuters to fill their 
own jobs with pilots who have less experience than in the past he 
said 
in the current era of rapid pilot turnover and the hiring of 
lessexperienced pilots in the commuter industry this question of 
pilot experience is becoming even more critical lauber said 
mcartor however said an examination of the pilots involved in 
last years commuter airline accidents doesnt support the 
conclusion that inexperience has been a factor in the recent 
crashes 
he said statistics gathered by the faa covering most of the 
pilots indicated that on average they had sufficient experience 
lauber said other problems commuter airlines face include a lack 
of simulators to train pilots instruments that vary widely and can 
confuse fliers and excessive cockpit noise that inhibits 
communication between crew members

politicians from naturalgas producing states 
are trying to forge an unlikely coalition of industry and 
environmental interests to promote the product and lobby congress 
texas land commissioner garry mauro who was among those 
attending a symposium on the subject tuesday said the natural gas 
industry has been timid too long 
the squeaky wheel gets the oil but natural gas hasnt been 
squeaky enough mauro said its not told its story loud 
enough 
oilman t boone pickens general partner of mesa limited 
partnership told the gathering the domestic oil industry will 
never return to its former glory 
theres not much future for the domestic oil industry 
pickens said but there is a lot of potential for the natural gas 
industry 
many of those attending the daylong symposium agreed that 
natural gas the cleanestburning fossil fuel can play an 
important role in efforts to rid cities of pollutants from industry 
and vehicle emissions 
daniel weiss a representative of the sierra club said his 
group would support the use of natural gas in legislation aimed at 
cleaning up the environment 
but officials said a significant switch to natural gas or other 
alternate fuels by power plants or automobiles is still years away 
rep mike synar dokla said some pressure could come this 
fall if congress approves legislation by aug 31 to yank highway 
and other funding from cities and states that dont comply with 
cleanair standards congress has lifted its requirement that 
cities meet those standards until the end of august 
according to the environmental protection agency 72 cities are 
not meeting cleanair requirements and are benefiting from the 
congressional reprieve

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis fresh from a solid win in new yorks big primary was 
looking to consolidate his strength with a repeat performance here 
next week but rival jesse jackson warned not to count him out 
a prize of 178 delegates the fourthlargest of any state race 
is at stake in next tuesdays primary here 
tomorrow we take our message to pennsylvania and ohio and 
indiana dukakis said in a victory speech in new york and 
after that we will take our message the democratic message to 
every part of the country 
the jackson camp offered congratulations but said the new york 
primary didnt settle things 
we continue to win we have won jackson told supporters in 
new york our campaign continues to grow 
we think were still in this race said jacksons campaign 
manager gerald austin jackson was heading to pennsylvania tonight 
tennessee sen albert gore jr who finished a distant third in 
new york was considering abandoning his presidential bid 
on the republican side vice president george bush who is 
virtually assured his partys nomination campaigned tuesday in the 
state 
a poll in todays editions of the pittsburgh postgazette and 
philadelphia daily news indicated dukakis led jesse jackson among 
likely democratic voters primary by a 5920 margin the poll of 647 
likely democratic voters conducted tuesday through sunday had a 
margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points 
the most likely scenario is that dukakis uses pennsylvania to 
solidify his frontrunnership his hold on the nomination said 
lt gov mark singel a democrat who is neutral in the race 
jackson supporters complained that pennsylvanias 
delegateselection system stacks the cards against their candidate 
the states popular vote is merely a beauty contest and the real 
winner in the primary must succeed in elections in the states 23 
congressional districts 
we could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates 
said steve cobble jacksons delegate coordinator calling the 
process one of the last vestiges of republicantype politics in 
the democratic party 
it ought to be done away with cobble said 
jacksons strength is largely in three of the 23 districts in 
philadelphia and pittsburgh where most of the states blacks live 
blacks make up about 11 percent of states votingage population 
even in the best scenario how he jackson gets more than 30 
delegates i dont know said g terry madonna director of the 
center for politics and public affairs at millersville university 
if its a twoman race it could be 31 dukakis 
jackson has only 79 candidates for 116 delegate slots to be 
filled from pennsylvanias 23 congressional districts another 62 
pledged delegates will be appointed in june based on the delegate 
division tuesday 
to fill in the delegate gaps the jackson campaign said tuesday 
it has mounted a dropouts turn to jesse program to recruit 
delegate candidates pledged to democratic hopefuls who have left 
the field 
its going well said spokeswoman janice fine we have a 
number thinking about it no question 
she said the campaign already has commitments from 8 to 10 
delegates and is working to fill other holes in jacksons delegate 
field 
but he said the outcome in pennsylvania would not dampen 
jacksons continuing campaign 
state democratic chairman larry yatch said jackson would carry 
philadelphia the rest of the state at least demographically 
doesnt seem to bode well for jackson yatch said 
singel the lieutenant governor also predicted dukakis would 
win but said jackson would do better than most democratic 
officials believe 
ill make a prediction to you that jesse jackson will get 
between 35 and 40 percent of the popular vote in pennsylvania he 
said 
the dukakis campaign has said its ready for a fight in 
pennsylvania 
mike is taking nothing for granted said his pennsylvania 
spokesman pat mccarthy he added however that a win in 
pennsylvania could put dukakis over the psychological top 
jacksons workers however remained upbeat 
as far as i can see everything is going fine weve got great 
expectations in pennsylvania said jamillah muhammad a national 
jackson campaign staffer working in pittsburgh 
jackson who won 16 percent of the vote and 18 delegates in a 
threeway primary race in 1984 hopes to court disaffected 
bluecollar workers in southwestern pennsylvania where 
unemployment still reaches double digits in some areas 
well do better than in 1984 exceed expectations and give 
dukakis a hell of a run for his money said ms fine were 
very competitive in pennsylvania

among the losers in new yorks democratic 
primary tuesday was mayor edward i koch who conceded that his 
bitter attacks on the rev jesse jackson were apparently a mistake 
despite the mayors highprofile criticism jackson won new york 
city by about 6000 votes over primarywinner michael dukakis in a 
heavy turnout of slightly less than 1 million voters jackson won 
37 percent of the vote overall 
while he was making hysteria i was making history jackson 
said after the votes were counted 
meanwhile network television exit polls suggested kochs 
hardball tactics may haunt him if he runs for reelection in 1989 
koch who endorsed sen al gore and then campaigned side by side 
with him has been widely criticized for his attacks 
if he had been more subtle about it it may have been more 
devastating to the jackson campaign said jacksons campaign 
manager california assembly speaker willie brown 
but the flagrant display of antijackson attitudes that 
appear to be primarily based on mr jacksons race have 
embarrassed some of the people in new york who may have been 
otherwise against jackson 
gores 83 percent in new york city was even behind his 10 
percent statewide total 
in the last few days of the hardfought primary koch was 
seemingly always at gores side in his city appearances the mayor 
claimed the headlines with a steady stream of invective against 
jackson 
koch sharply attacked jacksons positions on israel said jews 
would be crazy to vote for him and then called him arrogant for 
failing to march in a salute to israel parade 
asked tuesday night if he would make the same remarks if the 
clock were turned back koch said obviously i would not make 
them the way i did because apparently they were not helpful to al 
gore 
although gore thanked koch for his help he also distanced 
himself from the mayors tactics congratulating jackson on his 
showing gore said he never wanted to stop jackson i just wanted 
to start al gore 
a cbsnew york times exit poll showed that voters disagreed with 
kochs criticism of jackson by a 21 margin 
in an early nbc exit poll 60 percent of the voters said they 
didnt want koch to run for reelection next year 
it looks like ed koch certainly didnt help gore and may have 
helped stimulate a black turnout for jackson said abc pollster 
doug muzzio ed koch may be a loser here

michael dukakis and jesse jackson fought 
to a virtual draw in vermonts democratic caucuses tuesday night in 
a seesaw battle that tightened dramatically as the votes piled up 
early wednesday with nearly all the votes counted dukakis held 
a razorthin lead the massachusetts governor had scored a 21 
victory in the states beauty contest primary last month 
with 94 percent of 1300 state convention delegates picked 
dukakis had 559 or 46 percent while jackson had 547 or 45 
percent albert gore jr had 4 or 0 percent 110 delegates or 9 
percent were uncommitted 
dukakis would win 8 national convention delegates and jackson 6 
if those results held up at the state convention 
jackson had held a narrow lead throughout most of the counting 
in new york where he lost to dukakis jackson claimed victory in 
the contest here 
we won vermont tonight he told supporters 
a win for jackson in the democratic caucuses would be a 
disappointment for the dukakis campaign which has most prominent 
democrats in the state behind it including gov madeleine kunin 
sen patrick leahy lt gov howard dean and house speaker ralph 
wright 
kunin said jacksons strong showing in vermont was not 
unexpected and pointed to dukakis solid victory in tuesdays 
big new york primary 
i continue to be very optimistic about dukakis she said 
i think his showing in new york is fantastic 
in the states largest city of burlington jackson won 60 
percent of the delegates at a caucus highlighted by the appearance 
of burlington mayor bernard sanders a jackson backer and a 
socialist who has long fought the democrats 
i have no apologies to make to anybody sanders said before 
the caucus responding to democrats who opposed his appearance at 
their event 
sanders ran successfully as an independent for mayor and 
unsuccessfully as an independent for governor this year he is 
running as an independent for the us house 
on the republican side some 1000 delegates to the state gop 
convention were being chosen tuesday night with 33 percent of the 
delegates accounted for vice president george bush had 291 
delegates or 89 percent while 34 or 10 percent were uncommitted 
backers of dukakis who has long been favored here were making 
less upbeat statements just before tuesdays town caucuses 
i hear everything from were dead in the water to we might 
make it said william wasserman state coordinator for dukakis 
the governor of neighboring massachusetts supporters of jackson 
said they had built a solid organization in vermont and noted that 
jackson has done better in caucus states with relatively small 
turnouts than in primary states 
the 1300 delegates elected tuesday night will attend next 
months state convention at which time 14 of vermonts 19 
delegates to the national convention will be chosen the remaining 
five spots belong to gov kunin a dukakis backer and four state 
party officials 
on the republican side pat robertsons campaign tried to turn 
out supporters so that robertson would still have a voice at the 
state and national conventions 
the bush forces rallied and were able to overcome the 
robertson forces said bushs vermont spokesman steve watson 
we had the best turnout ever in some towns 
dukakis won vermonts presidential primary march 1 with 56 
percent of the vote to jacksons 26 percent but that primary was 
nonbinding and had nothing to do with the selection of actual 
delegates and recent history has shown primary winners dont fare 
as well in the caucuses 
gary hart won the presidential primary four years ago but 
walter mondale won the caucus vote eight years ago jimmy carter 
won the primary but edward kennedy won the caucuses 
the primary tends to be more of a popularity contest while the 
outcome of the caucuses revolves around campaign organization 
jesse jackson has done better in caucus states than primary 
states said liz blum jackson state coordinator in vermont 
noting that his supporters are so strongly behind him that they 
will attend caucuses 
we have identified jackson supporters all over the state and 
have built a solid organization she said 
about 670 people attended the burlington democratic caucus 
compared to 435 during the 1984 contest 
most of the towns that ive talked to have told me that 
theyve had the largest turnouts that they can remember said 
craig fuller the executive director of the states democratic 
party they are interested in whos going to be the next 
president

former white house spokesman larry speakes 
says he regrets concocting quotes that he passed off as president 
reagans own words and acknowledges he has provided fodder for 
the presidents critics 
i have wronged president reagan a man whom i deeply admire 
and respect speakes said tuesday and i have provided fodder 
for those who would aim their cannons of criticism at the president 
i served loyally for six years i deeply regret it 
speakes in an address at a washington post book and author 
luncheon said he had been overzealous and misguided in 
attributing statements to reagan that had been manufactured in the 
press office 
his comments were reported in todays editions of the washington 
post 
speakes on friday quit his job as chief spokesman for merrill 
lynch amp co because of the uproar over the phony quotes which he 
wrote about in his new book speaking out 
on tuesday he also offered a limited apology for some of the 
characterizations in the book 
i apologize not for the truth in my book nor the telling of 
it he said the truth never requires apology i do regret that 
i have overstepped the bounds of propriety in some instances it is 
for that i apologize 
speakes revealed in his book that on two occasions he had 
attributed quotes to reagan that the president never spoke in one 
instance the quotes were drafted in the press office and in 
another they had been spoken by secretary of state george p 
shultz 
the book also contains speakes blunt assessments of people in 
the white house and members of the press who cover the president 
in some cases i did overstep the bounds of common decency 
and yes courtesy speakes said i have needlessly criticized 
many whose professionalism i respect

vice president george bush predicts the winner 
of the new york democratic primary michael dukakis will go on to 
win his partys nomination and face him in the fall general 
election 
at the same time bush rejected as invalid liberal trash 
suggestions that his acceptance of support from former philadelphia 
mayor frank rizzo might send the wrong signal to blacks and other 
minorities in november 
are you suggesting you only appear with civil rights 
leaders bush asked reporters 
he made the comments aboard air force two late tuesday as he 
returned from a campaign stop in philadelphia where he shared the 
stage at a republican rally with rizzo pennsylvanias primary is 
tuesday 
bush said he had no hesitation in appearing with rizzo a former 
democrat who is his philadelphia campaign chairman to not do so 
bush said would be a policy of exclusion i dont do that 
the vice president who has the republican nomination 
essentially locked up said it was a good bet that the new york 
primary victor would be the democratic candidate 
i do think that whoever wins this new york primary tonight 
and this is my personal opinion will get an awful lot of delegates 
and win the nomination 
bush said he did not intend to criticize dukakis right away i 
think ill keep it generic until the convention he said 
but he referred to dukakis as an oldworld liberal democrat 
bush also defended his decision to campaign in ohio and 
pennsylvania on monday and tuesday rather than remaining in 
washington because of the persian gulf crisis there was no 
action required no decisons on which to advise if there had 
been an important meeting i would have been there 
on the subject of rizzo bush conceded that some blacks unhappy 
with rizzos tenures as philadelphias police chief and then as 
mayor might react negatively to his role in the bush campaign 
but the vice president said he intended to reach out to a 
variety of ethnic groups and to speak in ethnic communities 
my god to say that weve got to show that i care about civil 
rights and human rights in reaching out to others that i have to 
then turn my back on ethnic neighborhoods and values and 
individuals that are strong in those areas im not going to do 
that thats reverse discrimination 
bush said that by ethnic neighorhoods he was generally 
speaking about minorities other than blacks he cited 
lithuanians the polish church were talking about these ethnic 
wards in chicago 
and to suggest you have to write all those off to show your 
civil rights credentials to the exclusion of other minorities i 
reject that as a liberal point of view that i just dont conceive 
has any validity whatsoever 
what signals have i sent ive sent a signal that i want the 
vote of people in these ethnic communities who believe in the same 
things that i do and that our party does in terms of the 
importance of neighborhood family faith freedom thats the 
message im sending 
bush said that rizzo had lost in his most recent attempt to be 
reelected mayor as a republican by a slim 9000vote margin 
and to suggest that i should not appear with him because im 
worried that that will hurt me in some other areas im sorry i 
dont buy that i reject it as invalid liberal trash 
are you suggesting that 495 percent of the people in 
philadelphia are racist because they vote for a man who had been 
mayor of the city and who was campaigining on things that appealed 
to them its unfair and it is outrageous bush told reporters 
earlier with rizzo at his side bush told the gop rally in 
philadelphia i want to take on whichever one of those democrats 
wins today in new york and whip them in the fall 
bush wound up a twoday campaign swing through ohio and 
pennsylvania he planned to spend the rest of the week in 
washington

michael dukakis says he will not resign as 
governor of massachusetts if he wins the democratic presidential 
nomination in july or even in november if he should win the general 
election 
ill wait until im sworn in dukakis told reporters on 
tuesday 
since he formally announced his presidential candidacy a year 
ago dukakis has insisted he could serve as governor and run a 
nationwide campaign 
until tuesday he had never explained the circumstances under 
which he would surrender his office 
at a statehouse news briefing dukakis was asked whether he 
would resign if he wins the democratic nomination in order to 
devote his full time to the presidential campaign 
weve never expected that of our candidates nobody asked john 
kennedy to resign from the senate nobody has asked george bush to 
resign the vice presidency dukakis said 
as a matter of fact i think its a strength of mine that im 
an active working governor at the same time im running for the 
presidency i see that every day he said i will not give up 
the governorship i will continue to be an active governor as i 
have in the course of the primary campaign 
dukakis who is in his tenth year as governor rejected the 
notion that youve got to be unemployed to run for the presidency 
and said there were no circumstances under which he would resign 
before a presidential inaugural 
his statement may come as a disappointment to lt gov evelyn 
murphy under the state constitution she would automatically 
become governor if there is a vacancy in the governorship 
if she ascends to the governorship through dukakis good 
fortunes murphy could gain enough stature and political strength 
to win election outright in 1990 
dukakis is the first sitting governor to campaign for the white 
house since california gov edmund brown jr jumped into the 1976 
primaries the last sitting governor to win the presidency was 
democrat franklin d roosevelt of new york in 1932 
for the past year dukakis has generally spent about half of his 
time in the state and the remainder on the campaign trail

sponsors of a bill strengthening the ban on 
selling weapons to terrorist countries say the measure would 
clarify which weapons and countries are affected while making the 
president more accountable to congress 
the house foreign affairs committee on tuesday easily approved 
the legislation which would also impose civil and criminal 
penalties on violators the bill was prompted in part by the 
irancontra affair 
one of the sponsors reps howard berman dcalif said the 
original ban on selling weapons to nations identified as supporting 
international terrorism had been passed in 1986 as an amendment to 
the arms export control act 
but that prohibition was almost immediately trampled by the 
administrations sale of antitank missiles to iran in hopes of 
winning release of american hostages he said iran is on the state 
departments list of countries supporting terrorism 
the president failed to give congress the required notification 
for such shipments berman said 
over the years federal law has become riddled with overlapping 
standards that can lead to confusion and misuse berman said in a 
statement it remains unclear how to judge under the law whether a 
country supports terrorism which arms are restricted and when the 
president can waive the laws restrictions he said 
cosponsor henry hyde rill said consultations with the 
administration were continuing to further modify the bill in a way 
that would permit the president to waive parts of the act in 
emergencies that matter remained to be settled before the bill can 
go to the full house for action he said 
no republican member of the committee spoke up against it on 
tuesday and the bill passed on a voice vote

a scholar who pushed for release of 
the robert kennedy assassination files says the newly disclosed 
destruction of 2410 evidence photographs is deeply suspicious 
and should be investigated 
greg stone a university of wisconsin political scientist who 
has devoted years to studying the assassination said he was 
shocked that tuesdays opening of the files also brought word of 
destroyed evidence 
far and away the blinding central fact in this event is the 
unbelievable destruction of these photographs said stone that 
is an outrage and an insult to the american public this 
performance by the los angeles police would be a disgrace in a 
routine auto accident 
this is deeply suspicious he added 
stones comments came after california secretary of state march 
fong eu opened the longsecret files to the public and displayed 
significant items of evidence for reporters she held aloft a boxed 
22caliber gun used by convicted assassin sirhan sirhan to kill 
the us senator on june 5 1968 after his victory in the 
california democratic presidential primary 
among the documents displayed was a certificate showing that 
2410 police photographs in the assassination case were burned on 
aug 21 1968 
the states chief archivist john burns who cataloged the 
massive file for release speculated that the destroyed photos 
could have been duplicates but said the files contain no such 
statement 
less surprising said stone was confirmation that police also 
destroyed door jambs and ceiling tiles from the kitchen of the los 
angeles ambassador hotel where kennedy was gunned down stone and 
other experts maintain those items might have shed light on how 
many bullets were fired and on a theory there was a second gunman 
the los angeles police commission should investigate this 
he said referring to a civilian oversight board appointed by the 
mayor mayor tom bradley should demand it 
asked why he thought the material was destroyed stone said 
the most charitable interpretation is total ineptitude but 
you cant rule out suspicious and sinister possibilities 
stone once worked for rep allard lowenstein dny who raised 
questions about the case before he too was slain by a gunman in 
1980 
william booth a los angeles police department spokesman said 
he didnt know why the photographs and other materials were 
destroyed 
it was 20 years ago and i certainly dont have any independent 
recollection booth said i dont know whether what was done 
here is routine or not because i dont know what was done here 
sirhan a jordanian immigrant who scribbled in his diary rfk 
must die is serving a life term at soledad prison sirhan says 
he was the lone assassin but cant remember shooting kennedy he 
blames his amnesia on alcohol 
the material released on microfilm tuesday details interviews 
with 4000 witnesses including dozens of eyewitnesses and 
comprises 50000 pages 
eu also released a police composite videotape of the 
assassination scene kennedy is seen entering the kitchen 
surrounded by a large crowd screams are heard the badly jostled 
camera then shows kennedy lying in a pool of blood while other 
victims stagger about dazed and witnesses are seen weeping 
the assassination occurred before presidential candidates were 
provided with secret service protection 
also released was a tape of police calls on the night of the 
assassination showing there was a delay in sending police cars and 
an ambulance to the scene because the officer on duty didnt grasp 
the importance of what had happened 
told that there was an emergency at the ambassador hotel and 
that kennedy was there the unidentified police officer responded 
big deal 
after being told by a hotel employee that kennedy had been shot 
the officer asked her for the address apparently unaware of the 
location of the one of los angeles largest hotels 
documents show that once kennedy was inside an ambulance the 
senators distressed wife ethel demanded that attendants keep 
their hands off kennedy 
one doctor who attended kennedy in the kitchen complained about 
kennedy being taken to good samaritan hospital a central receiving 
hospital rather than a private facility with specialists in brain 
injuries but another doctor said it was wise to choose good 
samaritan which was only three blocks from the ambassador 
a large portion of the newly released police interviews focused 
on the allegation that a girl in a polka dot dress was seen with 
sirhan at the hotel and ran away from the assassination scene 
shouting we shot him 
the report was never verified but the files show that many 
witnesses claimed to have seen a woman with sirhan that night and 
one described a white dress with black or deep violet dots

michael dukakis won white votes across the board 
in new yorks presidential primary and pollsters say a sizable 
share of the one group he lost blacks likely would back him as 
the democratic nominee 
while exit polls tuesday found soft spots in dukakis support 
overall they love him here said cbs news pollster kathleen a 
frankovic three quarters of the states democrats viewed dukakis 
favorably she noted 
still there are weaknesses of course there are weaknesses 
she said this is a not a candidate who has gotten a lot of black 
votes 
indeed roughly 95 percent of black voters went for jesse 
jackson and an nbc news exit poll said a third of the black 
democrats held an unfavorable view of dukakis to 27 percent 
favorable and 40 percent unsure 
moreover 44 percent of the blacks told nbc that dukakis does 
not care about people like them while just 19 percent said he did 
care that is certainly not helpful to him said nbc pollster 
mary klett 
but while klett said dukakis if he were the nominee may have 
trouble drawing blacks to the polls other analysts said the 
problem may not be so great in an abc newswashington post poll 
65 percent of jackson voters said they would support dukakis 
against republican george bush in november 
jackson voters are much more loyal democrats said abc news 
pollster doug muzzio by contrast he said half the dukakis voters 
would favor bush in a jacksonbush contest and only 22 percent 
would support jackson 
in both the abc and nbc polls just over 25 percent of jackson 
voters said they would not vote in a dukakisbush contest but 
that may not point ahead to november frankovic said because the 
singlecandidate fervor of those jackson voters may fade also 
dukakis has not campaigned actively for the black vote essentially 
ceding it to jackson in the contests thus far 
estimates of the black turnout varied the abcpost poll put it 
at 27 percent up from 19 percent in 1984 but the cbstimes poll 
said it was 22 percent precisely the same as that polls 1984 
figure 
in any case the electorate clearly was polarized jackson won 
just about 15 percent of the white vote and slightly more 22 
percent in the abcpost poll of the nonjewish white vote about 
80 percent of jews and 70 percent of white catholics supported 
dukakis each group was a quarter of the total 
when you look at white voters hes got over 60 percent in all 
income groups over twothirds in all education groups hes got 
majorities of all ages majorities of religions abcs muzzio 
said in this bifurcated electorate he wins substantial and in 
some cases overwhelming majorities 
but the dukakis support was grudging in some cases in the nbc 
poll 57 percent of dukakis voters said they would like gov mario 
cuomo to be the nominee and more than half said they wished 
someone else were running in the cbstimes poll 72 percent of 
dukakis voters said they would have voted for cuomo had he been in 
the race 
his support is really sort of mush klett said of dukakis 
its not really a strong thing 
the abcpost poll found a measure of negative voting in the 
dukakis support about a fifth of the democrats said they were 
voting to stop a candidate from winning rather than to help a 
candidate they liked and threequarters of those negative voters 
went for dukakis muzzio said 
the racial and religious antipathy showed in los angeles times 
exit poll in which nearly twothirds of democrats said they 
believed there was an element of racism involved in the vote 
against jackson and about another third said they believed 
jackson is antisemitic 
this election was very polarized klett said jackson 
supporters are there they were with him a month ago and theyre 
still there whats going to happen in the fall is something 
dukakis is going to have to face

michael dukakis landslide in new york makes him 
the undisputed frontrunner in the democratic presidential race and 
raises the prospect of a unified peaceful brokerfree nominating 
convention that seemed wildly improbable a few weeks ago 
jesse jackson will press on with his remarkable campaign but 
his slim chance of derailing dukakis now grows slimmer with each 
passing week particularly if sen albert gore jr halts his 
campaign as expected on thursday 
the democratic partys going to be unified and were going to 
stop george bush this november said gore on what must have been 
the most disappointing night of his campaign jackson has said he 
wants to enable our party to win and is determined to play a 
role in making that happen 
pennsylvania votes next week and ohio and indiana after that 
and none of them offers the large core of black votes that gives 
jackson a secure base from which to spring an upset 
gores campaign suspension after a distant thirdplace finish in 
new york would mean dukakis no longer had to divide the white vote 
with another white candidate 
the district of columbia will be jacksons on may 3 but it 
could well be his last victory barring a lateseason protest vote 
against a cautious frontrunner always a california possibility 
for the democrats 
but the other primaries ahead offer dukakis a chance to pad the 
lead he has begun amassing in nominating delegates 
dukakis knows as much too even though he points out the 
nominating campaign will be contested until the last primary on 
june 7 even as new york was according him his frontrunner status 
he was making a sharp attack on bush in the manner of a candidate 
who expects to be the nominee 
this fall george bush is going to be judged by a legacy of 
pink slips for our workers golden parachutes for high rollers and 
greenmail for sharp operators on wall street he said in 
philadelphia 
i want to make that american dream come alive again not only 
in trump towers not only in fancy apartments all over this 
country not only in a few privileged neighborhoods 
dukakis has managed to achieve his supremacy in the race without 
relying on the traditional democratic party power brokers the 
aflcio hasnt endorsed him or any other democrat and dukakis 
managed to pull off his doubledigit new york victory without the 
endorsement of gov mario cuomo 
gore almost certainly will exit the campaign preaching party 
unity as he did when he congratulated dukakis in a new york 
concession speech 
and he wont be the only one talking that way 
neither dukakis nor jackson has shown much penchant for 
criticizing the other and any campaign debate is likely to be long 
on bushbashing and short on democratic bickering 
we respect each other we dont attack each other dukakis 
said you wont see either one of us attempting to hurt or cut up 
or otherwise cripple the opponents campaign 
still jackson has the most potential for creating mischief at 
the democratic national convention this year and the question most 
likely to be asked from now to the opening of the convention on 
july 18 is what does jesse want 
so far his principal answer to that question has been to stress 
his determination to elect a democrat the next president 
when a questioner at a new york breakfast asked jackson what he 
would do if he didnt get the nomination he replied that it was 
important to put the nation first and party second and your role 
third 
and so far not one word about wanting to be vice president a 
prospect that sends terror through the democratic party 
establishment 
thats the sort of behavior could make the democratic convention 
very peaceful indeed 
democrats are eager to put their nominating war behind them as 
soon as reasonably possible without offending jackson and the 
millions of black voters who have joined his crusade 
peter d kelly chairman of the california democratic party 
said many of the elected and party officials designated as super 
delegates to the nominating convention may be reluctant to jump 
too quickly onto the dukakis bandwagon 
theyre going to want to be real careful about angering jesse 
jackson and his supporters said kelly i for one am very 
sensitive about offending that constituency 
dukakis is unlikely to put any pressure on jackson 
instead he will turn his attention to the upcoming primary 
states and to the task of enlisting the uncommitted elected 
officials party leaders and uncommitted delegates to his cause 
that will enable him to arrive at the nominating convention in 
atlanta with the delegates needed to be nominated

moslem hijackers on wednesday freed 
their hostages from a kuwaiti jet after saying that algeria had 
offered a solution to the 15day ordeal in which two people were 
killed and dozens terrorized 
algerian officials said the hostages were whisked out of the 
plane before the hostages were released they would not say where 
they were taken 
interior minister hedi khediri announcing the release said the 
blue and white boeing 747 would be returned to kuwait 
he said earlier a solution settling all the issues of the 
hijacking has just been reached he refused to give any details 
of the agreement 
two women wearing black veils distant cousins of the emir of 
kuwait were the first to descend the gangway at 6 am 1 am 
edt they were escorted into a car and taken to a hospital along 
with a third member of the kuwaiti royal family who apparently was 
suffering from a nervous disorder according to dr youssef mahdi 
who had previously tended to the sick on board 
the rest of the 24 passengers then filed off the aircraft and 
got into a white bus which took them to the airport vip lounge 
they looked haggard and dazed but waved to reporters lining the 
tarmac 
the sevenmember crew of the kuwaiti airways boeing 747 were 
driven to the lounge in cars originally it had been thought there 
were about 35 passengers and crew but the exact number was not 
known until the release 
i cant describe how i feel to be free we lived through a 
16day nightmare its incredible that its over said mubarek 
abdelazziz elzeherran 23 a saudi student 
kuwaiti student youssef alangeri 24 said we lived in fear 
we were very frayed we had lost hope that it would turn out this 
way 
algerian officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
hijackers left the plane 20 minutes before the hostages were 
brought out they were taken away in unmarked automobiles 
according to the officials who would not reveal their location 
an hour after the release the door to the plane remained open 
with security officials and others milling about 
the gunmen had demanded that kuwait release 17 proiranian 
terrorists convicted of the 1983 bombings of the us and french 
embassies which kuwait had refused to do 
the hostages had been tied up and forced to keep silent while 
aboard the kuwait airways jet which was commandeered on a 
bangkokkuwait flight and flown to iran cyprus and algeria during 
long days of tense negotiations 
in a statement issued in arabic at 4 am wednesday 11 pm edt 
tuesday the gunmen thanked algeria for its help in the case of 
the brothers in kuwait and their help in other humanitarian and 
moslem causes 
the statement continued we declare to the moslem people and 
people who seek freedom that today on the third day of ramadan we 
will end the kuwaiti airplane operation giving our best regards to 
the kuwaiti people 
ramadan the moslem holy month started in algeria on monday 
we salute the offer made by the algerian government the 
hijackers said in the statement over the airliners radio 
the gunmen praised the palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories and denounced us secretary of state 
george p shultzs attempts to start middle east peace talks 
saying there is no solution but to get rid of israel 
the statement from the hijackers was preceded by a flurry of 
activity beginning at 3 am 10 pm edt tuesday when algerian 
mediators used radio to contact the aircraft dubbed by the gunmen 
the plane of martyrdom 
the pace of algerias mediation effort had appeared to step up 
tuesday when a mediator made at least five visits to the plane 
algerian officials had refrained from beaming a spotlight on the 
aircraft as it had done on previous nights 
earlier tuesday one of the members of the kuwaiti royal family 
held hostage said the captives are all in danger if her kin did 
not meet the demands of the shiite moslem gunmen 
we want you to tell our families that my sister and i and all 
the passengers are well although our morale is low and fadel is 
naturally deteriorating said anware alsabah via radio in a 
tense but firm voice referring to her brother fadel khaled 
alsabah and her 22yearold sister ibtesam 
it was the fifth time since the plane landed in algiers on april 
13 that the hijackers broadcast appeals for the kuwait government 
to release the 17 proiranian prisoners 
the gunmen hijacked the plane on april 5 with 112 people aboard 
the aircraft landed at houari boumedienne airport following five 
days in cyprus and three in mashhad in northeast iran 
a former algerian prime minister mohamed abdel ghani was seen 
at the foot of the gangway of the plane tuesday in intense 
discussion with one mediator 
algerian authorities had radioed the cockpit to say a very 
important person wants to see you before you make your 
declaration it was not clear whether the former algerian 
official was the person 
the start of ramadan drew speculation that the hijackers in 
deference to the holy month could show some flexibility

residents began rebuilding their lives and 
town today after floridas worst tornado in two decades killed four 
people and left millions of dollars in damage a college was ruined 
but its 2000 students were spared 
thankfully it happened when it did and not four or five hours 
later because the death toll would probably have been in the 
hundreds said william h mccoy president of north florida 
community college 
the tornado struck at 430 am tuesday tossing families out of 
bed while windows exploded and their homes collapsed on them it 
left 18 people injured and a 12milelong halfmilewide path of 
destruction in which 17 homes were destroyed authorities said 
gov bob martinez after assessing the damage in a helicopter 
declared a state of emergency paving the way for state agencies to 
assist madison county in cleanup efforts 
i havent seen one of these since one came through my hometown 
tampa back in 1966 or 1967 the governor said the tornado was 
floridas worst since one crossed the state from clearwater to cape 
kennedy in 1966 killing 11 and injuring 400 people 
gordon guthrie director of the states division of emergency 
management said his agency would complete a detailed damage 
assessment today possibly leading to federal aid 
the tornado was one of four that struck florida in stormy 
weather tuesday destroying several homes elsewhere and heavily 
damaging others twisters also struck colorado north carolina and 
california although no major damage was reported 
in madison only rubble was left in some neighborhoods and the 
mobile home of two of those killed vanished from its lot leaving 
only foundation blocks authorities said 
i woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as i woke up the 
windows blew out on both sides of my bed and the roof came down on 
top of me said mitchell may who was pinned in the debris for 
three hours 
twelve of the junior colleges 14 major buildings were heavily 
damaged and at least three were destroyed said mccoy who 
estimated damage to the campus at between 20 million and 25 
million 
among the buildings destroyed was a new regional library which 
had not yet opened that was to serve the college and county public 
schools and the campus chapel and a fine arts building 
state insurance commissioner bill gunter who toured the area 
said the campus buildings would be covered by a state insurance 
pool as well as with federal funds 
the four county residents killed included lavelle and robert 
mccullough both in their 60s whose bodies were found 100 yards 
from their vanished mobile home several miles northeast of town 
mccullough was scheduled to retire next january from his 
maintenance job at the college 
i think people of course are sad about the destruction of 
buildings they are sadder about the death of bob mccullough a 
very valuable employee mccoy said he hoped classes would resume 
monday 
also killed were walter oliver jr 39 and dearmiste pinesett 
41 said sheriffs spokesman juan botino 
eighteen people were injured and two of the more seriously hurt 
were flown 50 miles to tallahassee said jeannie baker 
administrator of madison county memorial hospital only two 
remained in the hospital and were in good condition she said 
at tallahassee memorial regional medical center brad williams 
14 was in serious condition after surgery for a punctured kidney 
and mary kay smith was in fair condition with a chest injury said 
hospital spokesman ron brafford 
the red cross surveyed residential damage and found 30 homes 
damaged and 17 destroyed said chris floyd damage assessment

a squadron flown by hill and capt stephen c leslie 30 of new 
bern during heavy fighting monday 
but the pentagon said hill and leslie had been sent out on a 
standard patrol sweep and that there was no evidence to 
suggest the missing gunship had ever come under fire 
defense secretary frank carlucci refused to speculate about the 
aircrafts fate as us navy ships and planes continued to search 
for the helicopter over the central gulf 
meanwhile four wounded sailors from the us frigate samuel b 
roberts remained in serious but stable condition and were expected 
to be transferred to hospitals in the united states today the navy 
said 
the ship was damaged in a persian gulf mine blast last week that 
was cited by us officials as justification for mondays attack on 
two iranian oil platforms 
after marine officials telephoned the hills about 930 pm 
monday the family has had little sleep 
i laid down sometime last night robert hill said tuesday 
but ive known every hour of the day my wife never went to bed 
i know she didnt sleep because i heard her in here wiping down the 
walls last night 
leslies younger sister kris leslie said her family received 
word around midnight monday that her brother was listed as missing 
she said the family had received no details since 
were very numb right now ms leslie said 
leslie and his wife lisa live in jacksonville nc where 
leslie and hill are stationed at new river air station he has been 
in the persian gulf area since the end of january ms leslie said 
on tuesday robert hill and his wife mary clung to hope as 
they waited with family and friends for word of their son 
the pentagon said he was on the american side hill 
recalled they said they dont think theres a possibility of the 
iranians picking him up they dont believe they were shot down 
the water is warm and its shallow as compared to the ocean i 
guess 
darrell leonard 30 a boyhood friend said hill was desperate 
to get the marines to reconsider his inner ear problem and allow 
him to become a helicopter pilot 
he was a fanatic when it came to flying leonard said we 
would talk for hours he liked the idea of flying low and flying 
fast 
robert hill said he has no regrets about the marine corps 
decision to keep his son the oldest of three boys 
this is what he wanted to do robert hill said this is 
his life

the american red cross has suspended 
processing of blood at its regional center here and fired the 
administrator two months after blood that failed aids screening 
procedures was distributed 
the nashville chapter which serves 100 hospitals in 90 counties 
in central tennessee western kentucky and parts of illinois and 
missouri also announced tuesday plans to retrain its technical 
staff on new equipment 
in the meantime blood donations to the nashville region will 
be processed by other red cross regional facilities said dr s 
gerald sandler associate vice president for blood services at 
national headquarters in washington dc 
chapter chairman max haught said the board of directors voted 
monday to relieve dr kenneth fawcett of his duties as director of 
blood services for the tennessee valley region 
neither haught nor chapter manager christopher parker would 
discuss the reasons for the dismissal 
sandler said that based on an evaluation of fawcetts 
performance american red cross president richard schubert withdrew 
his approval for fawcetts continued appointment the national 
headquarters took control of the program and brought in a doctor 
from wisconsin to supervise the laboratory 
fawcett said he is displeased and plans a news conference later 
this week to discuss his dismissal 
in march the american red cross acknowledged it had distributed 
24 pints of blood that had failed procedures against aids 
contamination or carried hepatitis b antigens but said none was 
used and none actually carried the aids virus 
the federal food and drug administration which released a 
report on the matter last month said the blood was shipped to 
hospitals and laboratories by red cross centers in washington 
dc and nashville 
initial tests showed that 10 of the units contained aids 
antibodies but those units underwent a process that breaks the 
blood into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus 
the red cross said 
other units were from donors who were unacceptable because they 
previously tested false positive for the aids virus but all 
the units later tested as safe officials said 
parker said about 20 red cross technicians in nashville will be 
retrained so that each knows how to use all new equipment the 
center has acquired including computers to manage data and a 
chemical analyzer that tests blood for the aids virus 
the laboratory is perfectly capable of testing blood and 
delivering blood safely sandler said of the nashville center 
but they are not capable of doing that and having retraining at 
the same time

most of the prize money from a super bowl pick 
the score contest went to postal workers and their friends who 
waited until after the game to submit their entries using 
backdated envelopes authorities say 
fourteen us postal service employees and three others were 
charged tuesday with obstructing the mail in separate schemes from 
five area post offices said us attorney andrew j maloney 
seven defendants including four postal workers were among the 
14 daily news contest winners and collected 35000 of the 100000 
in cash prizes authorities said 
two other postal workers split the 50000 grand prize with its 
winner judith febbraro said us attorney andrew j maloney 
ms febbraro 42 tipped authorities to her fraudulent entry in 
february after her romance with one of the postal workers ended 
maloney said 
she was not charged and a portion of her prize money was 
recovered maloney said 
the defendants in separate and unrelated schemes waited until 
after the 1987 super bowl and then used their positions or 
associations with the post office to mail in numerous entries in 
envelopes postmarked before the deadline maloney said 
the workers who were suspended without pay were employed at 
four post offices in new york city and one in yonkers 
maloney said the first time many of them met was at a dinner for 
the winners with quarterback phil simms who led the new york 
giants to a 3920 victory in the national football league game 
this newspaper had complete confidence in the integrity of 
this contest said gil spencer editor of the daily news as we 
understand it the only way the contest could have been ripped off 
was by a fraud engineered inside the post office by postal 
employees and thats exactly what the justice department has 
charged 
the company that administered the contest for the daily news 
dl blair inc of garden city received a total of 375000 
entries maloney said the winners were chosen in a random drawing 
from the 206 correct responses 
as part of the investigation blair recovered 167 of the entries 
with correct scores at least 107 of those entries were submitted 
by postal employees or people closely associated with them 
authorities said 
maloney said the scheme was part of an ongoing investigation by 
his office and postal inspectors 
the defendants were charged with obstructing the mail which 
upon conviction carries a maximum five year sentence and a 250000 
fine fifteen were arrested tuesday two remain at large

medical advances have been delayed and 
california research centers suffered 56 million in damages since 
1983 because of theft vandalism and arson by antivivisectionists 
scientists say 
the public is in jeopardy if biomedical research on animals is 
harmed since people benefit from experiments on animals said 
robert phalen whose air pollution laboratory at the university of 
california irvine was robbed of 13 beagles in january by what he 
termed radical criminal elements 
were mad as hell and were not going to take it any more 
said raymond eden associate dean of medicine at ucla 
phalen eden and other scientists spoke tuesday at a news 
conference sponsored by the nonprofit california biomedical 
research association which said seven attacks by 
antivivisectionists in california since 1983 caused 56 million in 
damage and the theft of 627 research animals 
the researchers said raids on their laboratories damaged 
destroyed or delayed studies aimed at saving the lives of nearly 
drowned children and people with sleep disorders protecting people 
from air pollution and fatal diseases and cancers and preventing 
outbreaks of avian flu and other diseases that kill farm animals 
the news conference was held to counter laboratory animal 
liberation week protests being staged this week around the los 
angeles area 
the researchers also accused antivivisectionists of harassing 
them and their families stealing documents staging photographs of 
alleged animal abuse lying manipulating public opinion and 
forcing research centers to spend money on additional security 
they call people nazis and claim they are murderers phalen 
said 
a guard was posted at the news conference to prevent disruption 
by about a dozen antivivisectionists who picketed outside with 
enlarged photographs showing cats allegedly maimed and killed by 
scientists at ucla and elsewhere 
people wouldnt be breaking into their laboratories if they 
werent committing obscenities alex pacheco chairman of people 
for the ethical treatment of animals said by telephone from the 
groups kensington md headquarters 
pacheco defended the laboratory raids as morally justified 
comparing terrible and inhumane animal experimentation with 
mass murder by nazis enslavement of us blacks in the 19th 
century and apartheid in south africa 
he also denied the researchers allegation that 
antivivisectionists were responsible for the april 1987 fire that 
caused 45 million in damage to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory 
under construction at ucdavis 
dr alexander ardans the labs director said he had no doubt 
antivivisectionists ignited the blaze spraypainted alf for 
animal liberation front on lab walls and vandalized 19 university 
vehicles 
activists opposed to animal experimentation distributed printed 
statements outside the news conference accusing phalen of 
needlessly killing beagles for studies that wont protect humans 
from air pollutants 
phalen said the dogs receive excellent care id rather be a 
beagle in my laboratory than any pet ive known he said 
he acknowledged animals perish in research but said such 
euthanasia is carefully regulated and that research benefits 
humanity

president reagan says the united states 
considers its confrontation with iran in the persian gulf 
closed following attacks that left two iranian oil platforms 
destroyed and irans navy heavily damaged 
it seems to be quieting down and we hope it continues that 
way reagan said tuesday 
reagan also said he was not surprised by irans decision to 
fight back monday after us forces destroyed the platforms in 
retaliation for the mining that damaged a navy ship last week 
the us navy later sunk or damaged six iranian warships in the 
daylong warfare 
the president commented on the gulf during a picturetaking 
session at the start of a meeting with republican members of 
congress 
later in a written report to congress reagan said no doubt 
exists that iran was responsible for planting the mines that 
prompted the us strike 
we have completed these selfdefense actions and consider the 
matter closed reagan wrote he said us forces must remain in 
the area and our forces remain prepared to take any additional 
action necessary to protect themselves usflag vessels and us 
lives 
secretary of state george p shultz echoed reagans comments 
saying us ships were in the gulf in a nonconfrontational way 
and did not want to be engaged in a confrontation with iran 
he denied irans assertion that the us attacks were planned in 
concert with iraqi attacks on the faw peninsula 
we and others have a right to unimpeded access to the 
international waterways and we protect that right shultz told 
reporters on his flight from washington for three days of talks in 
moscow 
meanwhile us ships and helicopters continued searching today 
for a marine helicopter missing since mondays violence in the 
gulf a pentagon spokesman said iran has claimed that it downed a 
helicopter although the us still lists the craft as missing 
we dont have any indication of the status of the helicopter 
or the people on board said maj william oconnell 
the pentagon identified the missing crewmen as capt stephen c 
leslie 30 and capt kenneth w hill 33 assigned to squadron 
hmla167 based at the new river nc marine corps air station 
reagan said nine ships were taking part in a searchandrescue 
mission for the helicopter 
the pentagon said there was no evidence the helicopter was shot 
down and reported no us casualties were reported in the warfare 
monday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said adm william crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told reagan and gop leaders 
tuesday that iranian ships were essentially staying in port a day 
after suffering heavy losses 
crowe also said there was no evidence iran had fired silkworm 
missiles as had been reported earlier 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said the pentagon had no estimate 
of iranian casualties in the fighting nor had us ships picked up 
any survivors 
howard also repeatedly and flatly denied press reports that the 
united states was temporarily suspending its escort operations for 
reflagged kuwaiti tankers until the gulf calmed down again 
sources close to the kuwait oil tanker co said the navy was 
halting until further notice escorts of the 11 tankers it reflagged 
nine months ago they said the main channel where the american 
frigate samuel b roberts was hit must be swept before the convoys 
resume 
howard declared tuesday when we get ready to do a convoy 
well do it saying reports of a suspension are simply not 
true 
the spokesman confirmed that us and allied minesweepers were 
continuing to find underwater explosives in the southern gulf 
almost a week after the roberts struck one on april 14 
at his white house meeting reagan won support from the 
republican lawmakers for his refusal to invoke the war powers act 
which the administration claims is unconstitutional 
the 1973 law requires the president to notify congress within 48 
hours after american forces are put into a situation in which they 
may become engaged in hostilities it also requires those forces to 
be withdrawn within 60 days subject to a 30day extension if 
congress fails to declare war

it almost seemed at times that new yorks 
democratic primary had boiled down to a race between jesse jackson 
and mayor edward i koch 
if so koch was clearly the loser 
mayor koch made hysteria i made history said jackson after 
finishing second tuesday with 37 percent of the vote 
jackson lost to massachusetts gov michael dukakis although he 
won a slim margin over dukakis in new york city despite bitter 
attacks by koch and the man the mayor endorsed tennessee sen al 
gore jr fared miserably 
koch conceded tuesday night that his attacks on jackson were 
apparently a mistake 
i did my best and i failed but the world aint over he 
said 
polls of those who voted tuesday indicated the primary tactics 
may haunt the mayor next year however when koch has said he plans 
to run for reelection 
fiftysix percent of the voters surveyed in a cbsnew york times 
exit poll said they disagreed with kochs criticism of jackson and 
60 percent of those polled by nbc said they dont want koch to run 
for reelection 
ed koch was certainly not a winner in this and he looks like a 
big loser said an abc pollster doug muzzio 
koch campaigned tirelessley alongside gore taking over the 
headlines when he sharply criticized jacksons positions on israel 
and said jews would have to be crazy to vote for him 
asked tuesday night if he would make the same remarks if he 
could turn back the clock koch replied obviously i would not 
make them the way i did because apparently they were not helpful 
to al gore 
later appearing on abcs nightline he added apparently 
the word crazy is not acceptable and i promise never to use it 
again 
jacksons campaign chairman california assembly speaker willie 
brown credited koch with improving jacksons showing 
if he had been more subtle about it it may have been more 
devastating to the jackson campaign brown said but the 
flagrant display of antijackson attitudes have embarrassed 
some of the people in new york who may have been otherwise against 
jackson 
democratic party chairman paul kirk praised jackson for showing 
laudable tolerance and restraint in the face of some bitter 
invectives that were visited on him and not by the candidates 
who have been positive

two american women and four costa 
ricans were wounded by a fragmentation grenade that exploded near 
the americancosta rican cultural center officials said 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for tuesdays 
attack which public security minister hernan garron called a 
terrorist act 
he said officials had no suspects 
the intelligence and security directorate said the blast 
apparently was caused by an m67 fragmentation grenade tossed onto 
a sidewalk near the cultural center three cars were damaged its 
report said 
the blast occurred shortly after 8 am 6 am edt about 50 
yards south of the cultural center building in the eastern los 
yoses district said us embassy spokesman mark krischick the 
building was not damaged he said 
he said tuesday night that us officials had been unable to 
verify that the explosion was caused by a grenade however he 
noted that costa rican officials were collecting evidence all 
day 
we havent had the opportunity to review the evidence 
krischick said earlier tuesday krischick had said the explosion 
was believed caused by a malfunctioning power line transformer 
red cross officials identified the wounded americans as alice 
feister a professor at the cultural center from the washington 
dc area and shelly bartain a student from california 
hometowns and ages were not immediately available 
feister underwent surgery for several hours at calderon guardia 
hospital after suffering a severe artery wound she was reported in 
fair condition tuesday night and was expected to pull through 
said krischick 
bartain suffered lacerations and bruises but was in good 
condition krischick said she was expected to return to the united 
states today a doctor at the hospital said 
the other wounded were identified as alvaro salas parra 23 
william quesada solano 22 oscar eric bogantes 17 and virginia 
sanchez cruz 26 all costa rican citizens 
garron said evidence collected at the scene indicated the 
grenade was thrown onto a sidewalk near the cultural center 
although it may have exploded beneath one of the three damaged cars 
parked near the center 
jorge luis ulate an explosives expert with the security 
ministry said the device appeared to be an m67 fragmentation 
grenade capable of inflicting serious damage up to a distance of 
100 yards 
ulate said the device normally would explode between two and six 
seconds after its pin is pulled 
by tuesday night police had not located any witnesses 
one person who spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity said he was near the site heard a loud explosion and 
later saw a cloud in the vicinity of the cultural center he said 
one person next to the nearby angloamerican school appeared to 
have been hurt by the blast 
president oscar arias visited the injured in the hospital and 
condemned the incident 
this country which is a haven of peace one day could turn 
into a costa rica invaded by terrorism and violence if we dont 
adopt energetic measures to prevent it he said 
the explosion follows a violent demonstration april 7 in 
honduras by students enraged by the forced extradition of a 
suspected drug dealer to the united states the students sacked and 
burned the us consulate and offices of the us information 
service in tegucigalpa the honduran capital

an official of the coast guard says a policy 
that leaves boaters in need of nonemergency help adrift and 
waiting for commercial tow operators while trained coast guard 
volunteers standby should be changed 
the policy adopted following 1983 instructions from congress 
limiting coast guard towing to emergency situations only has 
created situations where trained and eager coast guard auxiliary 
crews arrive first but are forced to simply standby and wait for 
commercial towers 
lawmakers recreational boaters and commodore william c harr 
head of the coast guard auxiliary on tuesday told members of the 
house merchant marine and fisheries coast guard subcommittee the 
policy is creating severe morale problems among the 32000 civilian 
volunteer force which was created in 1939 to augment the coast 
guard in world war ii 
this policy has dealt the organization a body blow by 
undermining the pride which members had in helping their fellow 
boaters harr said i am convinced that this dissatisfaction is 
a leading indicator of a massive and irreplaceable loss of trained 
qualified experienced auxiliarists 
however rep gerry e studds dmass suggested that the reagan 
administration is unable to decide on a policy because the issue 
pits the concept of privatization by allowing commercial operators 
to handle all nonemergency towing against the concept of 
volunteerism embodied by the auxiliary

an american red cross survey indicates that 
employee fears about aids and how to deal with coworkers who have 
the fatal disease are threatening a substantial disruption of the 
workplace 
the study released tuesday showed that 42 percent of 2000 
workers questioned nationwide said they would not work with anyone 
who has aids and 29 percent said they felt so strongly about it 
that they would quit their jobs before working with an aids patient 
aids is a contagious disease that destroys the immune system 
rendering the body incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections 
researcher david m herold of the georgia institute of 
technology who conducted the survey said there already have been 
incidents in which work came to a standstill as a result of 
unreasonable fear toward the disease 
he cited an incident at a a state government office in florida 
which was shut down after a worker with aids who became ill had 
vomited in his office

immigration officials will inform about 1000 
imprisoned mariel cubans that they are considered a risk to the 
public putting them a step closer to deportation 
under an agreement between the us government and mariel 
prisoners who rioted at a federal penitentiary in atlanta last 
year the detainees deemed nonreleaseable have 30 days to 
appeal to the us immigration and naturalization service 
duke austin an ins spokesman in washington said the agency 
would begin sending letters this week to the 1000 prisoners who 
have been considered risks to the community 
if their appeal to the ins fails the prisoners can appeal to a 
special justice department panel and get two more appeals if the 
government eventually orders them deported 
i think this is due process and then some said justice 
department spokesman patrick korten 
its a paper review its a joke said rafael penalver a 
lawyer here who is an advocate for the cuban prisoners who object 
to their detention but also fear deportation to their communist 
homeland 
penalver says those prisoners were not allowed to present 
evidence or witnesses and also wont receive hearings if they 
appeal 
a house subcommittee heard similar arguments in february 
federal officials responded that they were already going beyond 
what was required by law because of an agreement made when riots 
broke out last november among 3800 mariel cubans in indefinite 
detention 
the cubans who had come to the united states in an illegal 
boatlift from the cuban port of mariel all had committed crimes in 
the united states and served out their prison terms before 
immigration officials detained them 
as of april 8 about 970 detainees had been freed and 1100 
recommended for release to their families or halfway houses 
officials said

a former police lieutenant who 
testified against a fellow officer in a policeshooting case in san 
diego was shot at his home here said authorities who found a 
badge stuck to his shirt 
doyle f wheeler who moved here about 1 years ago was wounded 
tuesday afternoon at his home in the retirement community of 
suncrest about 20 miles northwest of spokane 
stevens county sheriff dick andres said wheeler 36 was able to 
speak to investigators tuesday night at a spokanearea hospital 
where he was being treated for a gunshot wound to his head that was 
not believed to be serious 
andres said a note was found at the shooting scene but declined 
to reveal its contents a san diego television station kfmb 
reported the note said this is a payback 
a san diego police department spokesman said wheeler told 
spokanearea authorities that three men broke into his house took 
him into the basement and beat him burned him with cigarette butts 
and pinned a police badge on his shirt before shooting him behind 
his ear 
stevens county chief criminal deputy jr mugaas refused to 
comment on reports that wheeler was tortured 
wheeler called 911 and said he had been shot andres said 
were treating this as if it were an attempted murder 
andres said 
andres said an allpoints bulletin was issued for three men who 
apparently sped away from wheelers home in his small foreign car 
ross kelley who lives next door to wheeler said he saw a 
police badge on wheelers shirt when he was taken by stretcher to a 
medical helicopter 
andres declined to say whether the assault may have been 
connected with wheelers former affiliation with the san diego 
police 
san diego police cmdr keith enerson however said there was no 
connection 
wheeler once testified in san diego at a trial of sagon penn 
who alleged he shot two officers only after he was attacked because 
of his race penn who is black was quitted of murder and 
attempted murder and lesser charges were later dropped 
wheelers testimony supported the defense theory that the march 
31 1985 shooting erupted during a racially motivated struggle 
provoked by the white officers 
police agent thomas riggs died during the shooting and police 
agent donovan jacobs and civilian observer sarah pinaruiz were 
wounded 
wheeler had testified that jacobs had once slammed a black mans 
head against a wall without provocation at police headquarters the 
former lieutenant said he didnt consider jacobs to be a good 
police officer 
no san diego police officers have been charged with any crimes 
in connection with the case 
the prosecution suggested that wheelers psychological problems 
distorted his criticism of police wheeler had been given a 
stressrelated disability leave from the police deparment in 
september 1977 and returned in april 1978 according to a san diego 
police spokesman 
wheeler was also among the first officers at the scene of a july 
1984 mass shooting at a mcdonalds restaurant in san ysidro a 
suburb of san diego that left 21 people dead 
wheeler his wife and their two children moved to washington 
state after wheeler received a stress disability retirement from 
the san diego police department said kelley

a 16yearold girl was killed in a new gang 
shooting as authorities searched today for a parolee armed with a 
sovietstyle assault rifle who is believed to have slain a 
6yearold girl in an act of vengeance 
the parolee was identified tuesday as george carter also known 
as george taylor one of two men held responsible for spraying a 
home with bullets sunday night killing irma saucedo 
her father salvador saucedo 39 died tuesday from wounds 
suffered in the attack one of several recently in gangplagued los 
angeles neighborhoods 
the saucedos were apparently caught in a deadly grudge over a 
blue baseball cap which irmas 13yearold brother refused to turn 
over to gang members authorities said 
the areas most notorious gangs the crips and the bloods 
advertise their affiliation by wearing blue and red respectively 
and wearing the wrong colors on gang turf can prove deadly 
a stakeout for carter 27 was called off late tuesday after an 
anonymous tip that he was seen in an apartment complex proved 
unfounded police said a 10000 reward was offered by the county 
board of supervisors for information leading to conviction of the 
killer 
carter was recently seen in possession of an ak47type 
weapon sheriff sherman block said referring to a soviet assault 
rifle favored by gang members rich from drug profits that was 
apparently one of the weapons used in this shooting 
the identity of the second gunman remained unknown 
the girl slain tuesday 16yearold alejandra melgoza was 
standing with friends on a street corner in suburban paramount when 
shots were fired from a passing buick said sheriffs deputy leo 
weitzel 
its just the luck of draw almost whether a young child is 
seriously wounded or killed by these cowardly gang members 
they just have no value for the life of anyone else said cmdr 
william booth the police departments top spokesman 
gang violence in los angeles county has claimed the lives of at 
least 93 people since the beginning of the year according to 
figures collected by the los angeles county sheriffs and police 
departments 
miss melgoza who died at a suburban compton hospital was 
friendly with gang members the girls sister hilda told reporters 
i guess the rest of the gangs knew that my sister was talking 
to different gangs and wanted to get revenge or something i dont 
know she told a local radio station 
also injured in the sunday attack was irma saucedos mother 
maria hernandez 39 who remained in critical condition the girls 
brother and cousin suffered relatively minor wounds

most of the 31 hostages who spent 16 
days aboard a hijacked kuwaiti jumbo jet emerged from their ordeal 
today dazed and trembling as though uncertain their nightmare was 
over 
few of the hostages saw the hijackers faces because the captors 
showed themselves only with their faces covered by pillowcases that 
had holes cut out for the eyes 
the worst moment was when they put a gun to the head of one of 
the passengers said the planes purser abdel monem mahmoud an 
egyptian their eyes were sharp and expressionless like those of 
a shark 
one of the hostages said he once caught a glimpse of the faces 
of five of the hijackers through a crack in a toilet door 
they were all very young said the man whose name was not 
used for his safety 
he said that from this brief view and from the hijackers voices 
he might be able to recognize some of them but he added all 
except their leader i never saw his face and he never spoke to 
us 
the hostages said no one among them knew that two kuwaitis were 
killed during the planes stopover in cyprus last week the 
hijackers probably used silencers on the guns with which they shot 
two kuwaiti security men aboard the plane 
i had no idea they killed anyone said ali kandari 24 an 
astonished expression on his face who was it where when 
none of the hostages reported being tortured or beaten but 
kandari said he saw one of the hijackers savagely striking an 
elderly man who insisted on going to the toilet after they had 
ordered him to sit down 
the man a diabetic was released last thursday and immediately 
hospitalized 
hostages said they were handcuffed at all times some even read 
the koran the moslem holy book with their hands in cuffs 
they said that on tuesday night just hours before their 
release the hijackers distributed the traditional fastbreaking 
ramadan evening meal then ordered the captives to go to sleep 
without allowing them the usual time for prayer 
a 31yearold businessman tadar el khebi said he knew they 
were about to be released today when he noticed the hijackers going 
through the plane shortly after 4 am wiping clean every spot 
where they might have left fingerprints two hours later the 
hostages walked out of the plane to freedom trembling and looking 
dazed 
many of the hostages said they were in constant fear for their 
lives 
from the very begining i thought of death mahmoud said i 
thought i would be the first to be killed because they were very 
security conscious and they immediately asked me where i had my 
gun 
my mind kept flashing back to my past he added at such 
moments you think about things that you never imagined you would 
remember 
mahmoud said it was the second hijack of his flying career with 
kuwait airways he said he was in a kuwaiti boeing 727 hijacked in 
1984 when two american passengers were killed 
im happy im still okay he said 
the iraqi captain of the plane graybearded subhi youssef 53 
sat quietly in the airport vip lounge as reporters milled around 
clearly a man of few words his eyes glinted when a reporter 
asked what he would do after returning to kuwait 
i will sit and think about it he said with a slight smile 
algerian aviation officials said they were impressed by the 
quiet and effective professionalism with which youssef handled the 
plane and its technical radio communications with the control tower 
throughout the ordeal in algiers 
youssef a pilot for 32 years 20 of them with kuwaiti airways 
was asked how he felt when the hijackers put a gun to his head in 
the cockpit when the plane was seized april 5 on a flight from 
bangkok to kuwait 
what can you do youssef shrugged in reply 
how did he feel now that it was all over 
i am really relieved he said his face showing fatigue 
algerian offials said the planes crew was too exhausted to fly the 
jumbo jet back to kuwait 
another hostage 26yearold lieutenant in the kuwait fire 
service who gave his name only as ali said he never lost 
confidence that the authorities would find a solution 
he said he fully supported the kuwait governments refusal to 
meet the hijackers main demand the release of 17 prisoners in 
kuwait convicted on terrorism charges 
we agree with our governments attitude he said but we 
knew they would help us our government never forgets any kuwait 
citizen

of the 255 delegates at stake in the democratic primary 164 
were expected to go to dukakis 89 to jackson and two to gore 
the republican primary in new york was little more than a 
formality along the road to vice president george bushs eventual 
nomination he captured 92 of the 96 delegates at stake in a race 
that saw less than 10 percent of the eligible republicans turn out 
four went to rep jack kemp who abandoned his campaign some time 
back 
turnout was much heavier in the democratic primary with more 
than 40 percent of the eligible voters going to the polls in 1984 
39 percent showed up 
the unofficial returns had jackson leading dukakis in new york 
city by about 6500 votes out of the almost 1 million cast 
however in the suburbs dukakis had an almost 90000vote margin 
and upstate it was a more than 120000vote margin 
what happened according to exit polls was that jackson 
collected about 95 percent of the black vote about 15 percent of 
the white vote and dukakis won almost everything else running 
strong among jews and pulling out other white ethnics the 
massachusetts governor did especially well among catholics 
the dukakis draw had some democrats smiling about a possible 
strong showing in november if he winds up with the nomination 
if theyre coming out today thats the first indication 
theyll be coming out in november said john marino a top new 
york party official and political aide to new york gov mario 
cuomo of the possible fall support for dukakis from the white 
ethnic voters a group that has gone heavily to republicans in 
recent national elections 
in winning new york dukakis easily bested walter mondales 44 
percent win in 1984 a victory engineered by cuomos political 
machine jackson finished about 10 percentage points higher than 
four years ago when he got 26 percent of the new york vote gary 
hart took second spot in the 1984 primary with 27 percent of the 
vote 
while dukakis handed jackson a considerable setback he did it 
without directly attacking him but exit polls indicated that many 
blacks didnt feel comfortable with dukakis and said he wasnt 
sensitive to their needs 
dukakis said he recognized the potential problem but noted that 
in his massachusetts races he had always gotten strong minority 
support he said if he is the nominee ill be reaching out 
gore on the other hand became the first of the democratic 
candidates to go directly after jackson talking about the need to 
elect a president not a preacher 
then gore got the koch endorsement and the attacks now coming 
from koch became more strident jews would have to be crazy to 
vote for jackson and jackson couldnt be trusted to tell the truth 
under stress said koch 
gore eventually said koch was speaking for himself 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin dismissed koch as 
crazy eddie 
after the primary results were in koch appeared contrite 
i said what i thought was true but obviously it did not help 
al gore said the mayor 
with the campaign appearing to narrow to a twoman race dukakis 
said he expected that he and jackson would avoid strong criticisms 
of each other 
neither of us believes that cutting up the other guy is the 
way you win elections said the governor

a loose fuel filter may have caused the engine 
fire that forced a horizon air commuter plane to crashland and 
smash into a passenger terminal airline and federal officials said 
a highpressure fuel filter from the wreckage appeared to be 
loosely connected as did another one found on a spare fuel 
assembly at a horizon air facility the officials said tuesday 
three of the 19 people injured in fridays accident remained 
hospitalized today one in serious but stable condition the others 
in satisfactory condition 
horizon air president john kelly said it was possible that a 
loose fuel filter could allow vapors or fuel to collect and ignite 
but whether that happened in the plane that crashed wont be known 
for certain until the investigation is complete 
the fuel filter was not tight said kelly it was slightly 
backed away which it should not be 
all airlines using de havilland dash 8 aircraft may be asked to 
check their highpressure fuel filters said bob benson who is 
investigating the accident for the national transportation safety 
board 
this may occur pretty shortly but were still in the process 
of checking a lot of other things he said 
horizon officials checked all of the airlines dash 8 engines 
over the weekend and did not find any other loose filters in the 
twinengine turboprops kelly said 
but they also found the loose fuel filter in a spare assembly 
fresh from the box which we would not have had contact 
with kelly said the federal aviation administration is 
investigating he said 
kelly said there was no connection between the latest engine 
fire and one that was reported last june 
he also said that different causes had been found for the fuel 
leak that caused the engine fire in june and a case of reeking fuel 
on april 8 in the engine that caught fire friday maintenance was 
performed and no further complaints were received after the april 
8 incident kelly said 
in june ntsb records say there was an explosion and fire in the 
right engine just after takeoff from seatac the pilot shut off 
the engine used two fire extinguishers to put out the blaze and 
made an emergency landing at boeing field no one was hurt 
ntsb records show a third such dash 8 engine fire in a metro 
express inc plane that tried to take off dec 2 1986 in atlanta 
in atlanta the dash 8 had just taken off and had gained an 
altitude of 4000 feet when there was a loud pop and smoke and 
fire in the right engine ntsb records say 
the plane first lost power then the fire started the pilot 
shut down the engine broke out fire extinguishers and was able to 
land there were no injuries

the oregon liquor control commission has agreed to tell 
distributors to notify the university any time a keg is purchased 
for one of its housing organizations moseley said

three or more students who pool their money to buy alcoholic 
beverages 
universityaffiliated housing groups will also be required to 
sponsor alcohol and drug educational programs at least twice each 
academic year

recent sweeps by police through ganginfested 
areas have jammed juvenile detention centers forcing hundreds of 
youths to sleep on jail floors authorities said 
as we continue the sweeps we need to take more steps to hold 
these additional kids chief probation officer barry j nidorf 
told the board of supervisors on tuesday 
he urged approval of a 2 million expansion plan that would add 
157 beds to the countys three juvenile detention facilities which 
currently have 1317 beds 
the board tentatively approved the expansion which would be 
accomplished by remodeling parts of each juvenile facility and 
asked nidorf and chief administrative officer richard dixon to find 
a funding source 
nidorf said roundups of gang members and drugrelated arrests 
made by police officers and sheriffs deputies helped push the 
juvenile jail population up to 2006 last month 52 percent above 
capacity 
officials reduced that number by about 250 by suspending many 
probation violations shaving time for people in weekend work crews 
and expanding home supervision programs 
still as many as 450 inmates have had to sleep on mattresses on 
the floor nidorf said all the other services such as 
schooling eating and recreation are not impacted and we have a 
sufficient staff

at times it almost seemed that new yorks 
democratic presidential primary had been reduced to a race between 
two men jesse jackson and mayor edward i koch 
if so koch was clearly the loser 
mayor koch made hysteria said jackson after a strong 
secondplace showing tuesday night i made history 
although jackson lost the statewide race to massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis he won narrowly in new york city despite bitter 
attacks by koch against jackson and the man the mayor endorsed 
sen al gore jr fared miserably 
in this case you had a mayor with a strong supporting cast who 
led the drive using race and relgion as a litmus test jackson 
said today on nbcs today show 
leadership has an obligation to set the moral tone it has an 
obligation to expand and build a coalition to relieve people of 
their fears and insecurities jackson said on abctvs good 
morning america 
he said the news media did not criticize the mayor when it would 
have counted 
during the campaign jackson had refused to comment on kochs 
attacks except to note new yorks touchy state of race relations 
and compare the mayors comments to yelling fire in a crowded 
theater 
koch a man hardly given to humility conceded tuesday night 
that his attacks on jackson were apparently a mistake given gores 
defeat 
i did my best and i failed but the world aint over he 
said 
the world isnt over but it may become a more difficult place 
for koch who reiterated his intention to run for reelection next 
year exit polls indicated that his hardball tactics may cost him 
in 1989 
fiftysix percent of the voters surveyed in a cbsnew york times 
exit poll said they disagreed with kochs criticism of jackson and 
six of 10 voters polled by nbc said they dont want koch to run for 
reelection 
the negative poll results also could have come from such factors 
as a corruption scandal that has hung over kochs third term and 
racial tensions in the city 
ed koch was certainly not a winner in this and he looks like a 
big loser said doug muzzio an abc pollster 
koch not only endorsed gore he campaigned alongside the senator 
from tennessee tirelessly and it was koch who captured headlines 
with his strident attacks on jackson 
but gore captured only 10 percent of the popular vote statewide 
and nine percent in the city 
koch criticized jacksons positions on israel saying jews would 
have to be crazy to vote for him the mayor then called jackson 
arrogant for failing to march in a salute to israel parade the day 
of the parade he said jackson cant stand stress and then he 
lies under stress 
asked tuesday night whether he would make the same remarks if he 
could turn back the clock koch replied obviously i would not 
make them the way i did because apparently they were not helpful 
to al gore 
later appearing on abctvs nightline he added 
apparently the word crazy is not acceptable and i promise never 
to use it again 
although gore thanked koch for his help he also seemed to 
distance himself from the mayors tactics after congratulating 
jackson for his showing gore said i didnt want to stop jesse 
jackson i just wanted to start al gore 
jacksons campaign chairman california assembly speaker willie 
brown credited koch with improving jacksons showing 
if he had been more subtle about it it may have been more 
devastating to the jackson campaign brown said but the 
flagrant display of antijackson attitudes have embarrassed 
some of the people in new york who may have been otherwise against 
jackson

michael dukakis left new york triumphant today 
cautioning that his nomination is not yet inevitable but already 
focusing on george bush and the republicans with a promise to 
take our message the democratic message to every part of the 
country 
yesterday obviously was a wonderful day in new york dukakis 
said at a morning news conference i also know however that 
nothing in the world is inevitable and weve got much to do in the 
pennsylvania primary this week and the primaries to follow 
dukakis launched his campaign in the next primary state 
pennsylvania even before the polls here had closed 
this fall george bush is going to be judged by a legacy of 
pink slips for our workers golden parachutes for high rollers and 
greenmail for sharp operators on wall street he said in 
philadelphia tuesday night 
i want to make that american dream come alive again not only 
in trump towers not only in fancy apartments all over this 
country not only in a few privileged neighborhoods 
dukakis said he spoke by telephone with jesse jackson early 
today but said he declined an invitation to meet with albert gore 
jr who may withdraw after his dismal thirdplace finish in new 
york 
im sure well be talking he wanted to meet this morning and 
i just couldnt do it the massachusetts governor said ive 
got to get back to boston ive got a very important meeting at 10 
oclock of my anticrime council and a very full agenda and i just 
had to get back there hes a good guy and ive enjoyed getting 
to know him and i respect him 
dukakis said gores withdrawal from the race is something he 
has to decide he said he would be willing to help gore or any 
other candidate pay off campaign debts 
the governor said jackson called him with congratulations asked 
if he would consider jackson as a running mate dukakis said i 
wouldnt rule anything in or out 
dukakis planned to resume campaigning thursday in ohio which 
has its primary in two weeks 
celebrating tuesday night he predicted the battle for the 
democratic presidential nomination will continue until the last 
primaries 
today was a great day but our job has just begun dukakis 
told a buoyant crowd tuesday night in the manhattan hotel that 
served as his headquarters 
he returned to new york from philadelphia to claim the victory 
that moved him a giant step toward the nomination and likely will 
narrow the race in the remaining states to just himself and jesse 
jackson 
tomorrow we take our message to pennsylvania and ohio and 
indiana and after that to oregon and california and new jersey and 
the remaining primary states he said and after that we will 
take our message the democratic message to every part of the 
country 
in philadelphia he unveiled a retooled campaign speech before a 
crowd of more than 1500 democrats at a state party dinner he 
blasted the republican vice president and linked him to privileged 
excess and corporate greed themes he didnt mention as he 
campaigned near wall street a day earlier 
the dimensions of the massachusetts governors victory were 
enough to make it likely albert gore jr would drop out of the race 
and leave dukakis the only white democrat in the race with jackson 
it was a victory that pushed him far ahead in the delegate race 
and while not yet close to a majority of delegates gave him the 
look of the likely nominee 
dukakis didnt claim that title for himself however aides said 
he would compete vigorously in the pennsylvania primary next 
tuesday and in ohio and indiana the week after that his 
pennsylvania chairman lanny johnson acknowledged dukakis is at a 
large advantage in that state as the only candidate with a full 
slate of delegates on the ballot

instructors at eastern illinois 
university are challenging a decision to ban the untouchables 
from the campus television station 
the illinois board of governors of state colleges and 
universities which oversees the 10000student campus voted 60 
last thursday to bar weiutv from airing the series board member 
dominick bufalino said the untouchables was too violent and 
created a negative stereotype of italianamericans 
why should we show a program that is controversial and is 
offensive to a segment of our population he said we should be 
educating not teaching bigotry 
robert stack who starred in the emmy awardwinning series from 
1959 to 1963 called the ban ridiculous 
stack portrayed eliot ness in the untouchables which 
focused on the battles of ness and other lawmen against chicago 
gangsters during prohibition a film version of the stories with 
kevin costner as ness just won an academy award for sean connery as 
best supporting actor 
john beabout director of the universitys radiotv center said 
it was the first time the board had rejected funding for a series 
on the station 
members of the universitys faculty senate reacted angrily to 
the ban tuesday calling it a violation of academic freedom and 
approved a resolution asking the board to reconsider its decision 
stack said he is leaving for italy later this month to accept an 
award for his role in the series which he said is no 1 in that 
country 
i find it highly ironic that the italians are honoring the 
untouchables and the americans are trying to censor it he said 
several faculty members agreed 
i could no longer teach romeo and juliet because it deals 
with teenagers and violence according to the rationale of the 
board said english professor michael loudon 
no state funds would have been used to buy 80 to 90 episodes for 
the station the 25650 needed to air the program would have come 
from a grant from the corporation for public broadcasting but the 
board must approve all university expenditures of more than 10000

police today recovered a 13th century 
popes mummified remains that were stolen from a cathedral three 
days earlier 
the remains of celestine v who resigned in 1294 after a 
fivemonth papacy were found in a plywood box hidden in the hollow 
of a cemetery wall authorities reported police said they found 
the site by following suspected thieves who got away 
church officials said the remains of the roman catholic pope 
stolen from the cathedral in the southern city of laquila on 
sunday night had not been damaged during the theft 
the brief papacy of celestine who died in 1296 was marked by 
subservience to charles ii king of naples acknowledging his 
incompetence celestine declared that a pope had the right to 
resign and did so 
celestine was canonized by pope clement v in 1313 
church bells pealed in laquila and in celestines hometown of 
isernia to celebrate the recovery of the remains the vatican 
newspaper had earlier reported the profound indignation in 
laquila for the grave sacrilegious act 
police said they recovered the remains in the cemetery at 
amatrice 40 miles south of laquila after following an 
undisclosed number of suspects the italian news agency ansa said 
the suspects escaped as police concentrated on recovering the 
remains 
authorities were looking for the suspects today 
the thieves took the remains after forcing open a chapel door in 
the cathedral of santa maria di collemaggio investigators 
theorized they may have been planning to ask for a ransom although 
no demand had been reported 
the laquila archbishops office said the remains would be 
returned monday to the cathedral where they had been held since 
1327 after an alarm system is installed

the missing us marine 
helicopter that iran claims to have shot down was on a night 
mission in the persian gulf following daylong clashes between us 
and iranian forces us officers said 
the ah1 cobra gunship and its twoman crew failed to return to 
the guided missile cruiser wainwright from the monday night flight 
the search continued today 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr mark van dyke said there was no 
evidence the helicopter was shot down 
the gunship regularly based aboard the dock landing ship 
trenton flew support missions earlier monday as us forces 
attacked two iranian oil platforms in what the reagan 
administration called a measured response to irans mining of gulf 
sea lanes and other hostile acts 
senior us officers said tuesday that the battle was over as 
far as the united states was concerned but there was no assurance 
iran felt the same way 
capt donald dyer who commands a us destroyer group in the 
gulf said the situation remained tense but i think its 
beginning to back off a little bit he said the iranians took 
some heavy losses 
cmdr edward mann skipper of this frigate that flies the flag 
of dyers command said he was surprised by irans response monday 
mann said he did not believe iran would cease its attacks on 
neutral commercial shipping 
us officers appeared satisfied with the outcome of the series 
of clashes monday that began with the platform attacks about 8 am 
in the course of it iran fired five missiles at the jack 
williams and two destroyers sailing with it navy officers aboard 
ship said they were chinesemade silkworm missiles fired from 
antiship batteries along the strait of hormuz for the first time 
but the pentagon said it has not determined what type of missile 
was fired 
all five missiles went awry their guidance systems confused by 
aluminum chaff fired into the air by the us ships 
a sixth missile was reported fired from the faw peninsula of 
southern iraq but the result was not known to officers here 
van dyke said there were no american casualties in mondays 
warfare and iranian casualties were not known 
the united states claimed one iranian patrol boat sunk three 
speedboats sunk or damaged and two frigates disabled in addition 
van dyke said the two oil platforms at sirri and sassan in the 
southcentral gulf were neutralized 
both platforms had been used for military purposes including 
support for speedboats that attack neutral shipping the united 
states said iran has justified its attacks on merchant shipping 
saying they are in retaliation for iraqi attacks on its own oil 
tankers 
iran and iraq have been at war for 7 years 
us officials said the iranians were advised by radio of us 
intentions before they were attacked 
iranians at sirri and sassan were given five minutes to evacuate 
before the shellings began both platforms were bombarded before 
marines from the trenton went aboard sassan and destroyed it with 
demolition charges 
when an iranian tugboat at sirri radioed the wainwright for 
permission to pick up survivors in the water capt james 
chandler who commands the cruiser agreed and also dropped 
lifeboats 
minutes later the joshan one of irans fast seakiller 
missileequipped patrol boats raced toward the wainwright and was 
warned by its skipper that if it approached any closer it is my 
intention to sink you 
the iranian boat then fired a missile at the wainwright which 
launched chaff the simpson fired an sm1 missile that blew the 
patrol boat apart 
us officiers said the two iranian frigates sahand and 
sabalan also fired on us aircraft after ignoring warnings 
against taking hostile action 
also iranian speedboats and a helicopter attacked an 
americanrun oil rig in the mubarak oil field off the united arab 
emirates and damaged the american resupply vessel willie tide 
an a6 intruder fighter jet from the carrier enterprise attacked 
the speedboats and at least one was sunk the others damaged 
the jack williams and two destroyers were speeding back into the 
gulf from the strait of hormuz when they received word the sahand 
and at least eight speedboats were approaching from irans naval 
base at bandar abbas 30 miles to the north 
the sahand is in your vicinity take him was the terse 
message from rear adm anthony less commander of the joint task 
force middle east 
us officers said two a6s drew missile fire from the sahand 
and retaliated with harpoon missiles that damaged the 12yearold 
britishbuilt frigate 
then the uss joseph strauss sailing just ahead of the jack 
williams fired another harpoon blasting the ship from 20 miles 
away when last seen it was listing badly with a hole in its hull 
and its superstructure ablaze whether it sank was not known van 
dyke said 
the sabalan was hit by f14 tomcats also flying off the 
enterprise in the arabian sea it was hit by a laserguided skipper 
bomb and left dead in the water its fate also was unknown

three key parties to the crash of northwest 
flight 255 have prepared sharply differing reports on the causes of 
the accident that killed 156 people last summer the detroit news 
reported today 
the investigation of the aug 16 1987 crash at detroits 
airport has centered on the position of wing flaps and slats that 
provide lift for takeoff 
the reports by the maker of the jet the pilots union and the 
airline will be considered by the national transportation safety 
board at hearings next month the newspaper said 
douglas aircraft co maker of the md80 jetliner in its 
report blamed shoddy pilot performance accusing the crew of 
acute negligence and a casual attitude toward cockpit 
discipline the newspaper said 
the crew failed to set the planes wing flaps but douglas said 
the root cause of the crash was the crews failure to perform a 
preflight check of flap settings 
douglas dismissed charges that a circuit breaker may have caused 
a malfunction in an audible warning system that should have alerted 
the crew to the flap problem 
northwest airlines report blames the failure of the flap 
warning system for the crash the newspaper said the airline said 
a circuit breaker contaminated by tarnish on electrical contact 
points caused the failure 
though douglas agreed that the circuit breaker showed a buildup 
of tarnish the company disagreed that the tarnish interrupted 
power douglas said the crew purposely disconnected the warning 
system and forgot to reset it 
northwest also said the plane probably would not have crashed if 
one of its wings had not been sheared off partially by a 
48foottall light pole at the end of the runway that the airline 
suggested was taller than the federal aviation administration 
allows 
the plane didnt gain enough altitude to avoid hitting the light 
pole in a parking lot it burst into flames crashing on a road 
near the airport and slamming an overpass 
only 5yearold cecelia cichan survived the crash the 
secondworst aviation disaster in us history 
the air line pilots association the pilots union said the 
planes flaps and slats were not extended because of an unspecified 
mechanical failure or because the pilots were distracted and forgot 
to set them 
alpa also said it had examined northwest maintenance records on 
the plane for the previous 15 months before the crash and found 
continuing problems with the flapslat positioning and indicating 
system 
the ntsb is scheduled to vote on the probable cause of the crash 
at a public hearing may 10 in washington dc the boards own 
analysis is incomplete ntsb spokesman alan pollock said 
the reports by northwest douglas and alpa seek to persuade the 
ntsb to adopt at least part of their versions in hopes of limiting 
potential damage to their reputations 
the reports also seek to minimize exposure to scores of lawsuits 
filed by relatives of those who died in the crash although the 
ntsbs determination of probable cause will be inadmissible in 
court it could help plaintiffs lawyers plan their legal attacks 
at the hearing the ntsb also will consider recommending that 
the faa adopt new or revised aviation safety rules

iran today told all volunteers to report 
for duty and put its bases on alert to face what it called 
bestial aggression from the united states and iraq kuwait said 
iran fired a missile into its territory before dawn 
iran said it launched a new thrust into northeastern iraq and 
both iran and iraq reported exchanging air strikes 
shipping executives said commercial vessels were avoiding the 
persian gulf and iranian warships were reportedly staying in port 
the us navy sank or damaged six iranian vessels and destroyed 
two offshore oil platforms monday in the heaviest fighting with the 
iranians since the us navy began escorting kuwaiti ships in the 
gulf last july 
kuwaits defense ministry gave no details of where the 
scudtype missile exploded today or whether it caused 
casualties or damage but said kuwait has the full right to take 
what it sees as appropriate measures toward this new aggression 
directed against its territories 
a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the missile 
fell near desert oilfield operated by getty oil in the vicinity of 
wafra on the saudi border 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran in a message 
reported on tehran radio today said the government of kuwait is 
responsible for all the consequences of its support for the 
aggressive iraqi regime in the gulf war 
velayatis statement was in a message to the organization of the 
islamic conference accusing kuwait of giving financial and other 
support to iraq the radio monitored in cyprus did not say when 
the message was sent 
the scud is a sovietdesigned surfacetosurface missile with a 
range of about 180 miles iran has used such missiles against iraq 
in the 7yearold gulf war 
iran last year fired several chinesemade silkworm missiles into 
kuwaits coastal waters from the faw peninsula 
tehran radio announcing the nationwide mobilization declared 
today our revolution and our heroic nation is faced with the 
onslaught of the evil triangle of america iraq and the 
reactionaries 
it said all volunteers should report to their bases throughout 
the country and get ready for departure to the battlefront the 
broadcast did not mention numbers but iranian leaders have claimed 
more than 3 million iranians have undergone military training in 
the last six months 
the radio added at this critical juncture in order to 
respond to the bestial aggression of america and regional 
reactionaries all basij volunteer forces should immediately 
report for duty 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus said iranian forces killed or wounded 300 iraqis and 
captured more than 250 in the shemiran mountain region of kurdistan 
in the new offensive 
the agency said iranian warplanes bombed military and economic 
targets in the northern iraqi city of erbil soon after dawn 
today causing heavy damage and casualties the iraqis reported 
civilian casualties but gave no numbers 
irna said iraqi warplanes bombed residential areas of the 
western cities of dezful hamedan and boroujerd causing civilian 
casualties 
iraq claimed its forces were mopping up iranian pockets of 
resistance in the faw peninsula which it recaptured this week 
iran seized control of the strategic peninsula two years ago 
the search continued today for a us marine attack helicopter 
and its twoman crew missing since going out on a night mission 
following mondays fighting 
there was no estimate of iranian casualties monday but navy 
officers said they presumed them to be heavy 
iran has maintained the us attacks on iranian oil platforms 
were planned in concert with iraq 
secretary of state george p shultz denying that assertion 
insisted the united states is neutral in the gulf war and said the 
american presence in the gulf is nonconfrontational 
the reagan adminstration said it attacked the iranian oil 
platforms in retaliation for the mine that damaged the uss samuel 
b roberts last week wounding 10 crewmen the navy said other 
iranian targets were fired on only after they threatened us 
forces 
president reagan said there was no doubt iran planted the mine 
that damaged the roberts he said it was quieter in the gulf 
tuesday and we hope it continues that way 
one gulfbased marine salvage executive said the gulf appeared 
ghostly today from lack of shipping he and others who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said commercial vessels were avoiding 
the waterway

it can get mighty lonely in the new 
hampshire woods as an 18yearold female pony named princess has 
discovered 
for the last five months princess has been the object of 
affection of a 900pound bull moose nearly twice her size however 
a man photographing the unlikely pair believes the relationship is 
maternal 
he even tries to follow the pony into the barn he thinks she 
is his mother said herbie ainsworth of gilmanton who refuses to 
disclose the farms location for fear that someone might shoot the 
moose 
the moose nicknamed prince stays in the pasture all day 
watching the pony and then returns the next morning he said 
recently the farms owners dont feed the moose though it often 
tries to enter the barn for a bite of hay 
its rare for a moose to be attracted to domestic livestock but 
not unheard of 
in 1986 a vermont heifer named jessica attracted the affections 
of a bull moose for a 76day romance that sparked interest 
nationwide before he resumed his life in the wild 
kristine klein a state biologist said that a cow moose drives 
away its calf when the youngster is about a year old and that 
after being abandoned a young moose occasionally will attach 
itself to another moose or to domestic livestock

deadly complications of strokeprevention 
surgery could be reduced by a new method using a laser beam to 
clear blocked neck arteries says a doctor who reported performing 
the procedure for the first time 
the surgery performed last friday on a 72yearold california 
man represents the first time laser light has been applied to 
the treatment of carotid artery disease said dr john eugene 
who worked with cardiovascular surgeon richard ott 
i feel excellent and i think the operation was quite a 
success the patient kenneth b smith said tuesday by telephone 
from his san clemente home the neck is a little sore from the 
incision but otherwise im fine 
smith was discharged monday from the university of california 
irvine medical center in orange 
for more than two weeks before the operation smith suffered up 
to a dozen transient ischemic attacks nicknamed 
ministrokes because his left carotid artery one of two main 
neck arteries supplying blood to the brain was 85 percent to 90 
percent blocked by fatty deposits called plaque 
because the blockage impeded blood flow to smiths brain he 
suffered repeated temporary paralysis of his right arm leg and 
hand and the right side of his face and faced the possibility of a 
massive possibly deadly stroke caused either by the blockage or a 
loosened piece of plaque eugene said 
surgery to clear such blockages is called carotid 
endarterectomy in conventional surgery the neck is cut open the 
artery is exposed and a knife is used to remove the plaque then 
the artery and neck are closed 
but in the operation performed by eugene and ott a lowpower 
beam from an argon ion laser was aimed between the plaque and 
underlying artery wall to remove the plaque cleanly eugene said 
we feel it offers a substantial advantage over the knife 
technique because we leave a smooth artery surface with the layers 
of the artery welded together by the laser beam he said 
rand corp researchers reported last month in the new england 
journal of medicine that 10 percent of elderly americans who 
undergo conventional carotid endarterectomy die or suffer strokes 
as a direct result of the surgery which has been criticized as 
being overused 
eugene said the laser approach should reduce such fatal 
complications because it repairs the artery wall and reduces the 
odds that debris will break off from it to cause a stroke 
however dr sam ahn a vascular surgeon at the university of 
california los angeles said the success of such surgery depends 
more on the surgeon than the equipment used so he was skeptical if 
complication rates really would be reduced since they already are 
quite low at major medical centers 
he said the laser surgery is the first reported as far as i 
know 
the new method has been under development since 1982 at 
ucirvine and doctors hope to use it by years end to clear 
blocked heart arteries eugene said adding he previously used it 
to clear blocked leg and arm arteries 
the method differs from another technique in which a 
lasertipped catheter is inserted into an artery to clear 
blockages that technique hasnt been used on carotid arteries 
because it poses a higher risk of causing a piece of plaque to 
break off and trigger a stroke eugene said

smith college student activists say 
that the college presidents response to their grievances is 
inadequate and they are planning to meet with a federal official 
about campus racism 
weve heard a lot of talk we need to see something solid 
jennifer fleming a member of concerned students of all colors 
said tuesday 
president mary maple dunn released her response to the 18 
grievances that dozens of members of the ad hoc student group had 
delivered to her in a protest march on her house sunday 
the students in their list decried the dearth of minorities 
among faculty staff and administrators and complained that 
students had been excluded from the search for an affirmative 
action officer among other things 
the group threatened to file a civil rights complaint with the 
hampshire county district attorney and a discrimination complaint 
with the massachusetts commission against discrimination if nothing 
was done about their grievances 
wambui mwangi a sophomore who is among the students who helped 
draw up the grievances said tuesday that ms dunns response was 
inadequate 
the students said they intended to keep their scheduled meeting 
today with a community relations specialist from the justice 
department and to hold a general meeting at 430 pm friday to 
discuss ms dunns response 
in a statement prefacing her pointbypoint response ms dunn 
described the grievances as longstanding complaints which have 
been brought to the attention of the administration before 
she added however we think it only fair that students 
acknowledge that some steps to redress these grievances have been 
taken she said tuesdy she planned to meet with students in the 
near future 
among her responses she 
acknowledged the faculty is nearly allwhite that no people 
of color hold top administrative posts that minorities are 
underrepresented at all levels of influence she said however 
that the college would follow minority hiring goals set by a 
stilltobehired affirmative action officer 
countered students claims of exclusion from the search for the 
officer by saying student leaders had been invited to interview 
finalists and students had never before expressed interest in 
serving on search committees 
announced she would create the post of ombudsperson to serve as 
an advocate against discrimination 
ms fleming said students have met often with ms dunn about 
minority concerns 
the point of the protest was to get reaction not to get mary 
to talk to us again she said it was a show of strength of 
frustration 
she said the group consisted of an indefinite number of 
students and was formed simply to protest whoever wants to can 
join 
a report issued last month by a faculty group called committee 
on community policy recommended that the college try to make the 
faculty 20 percent minority within five years currently 5 percent 
of employees are members of minority groups 
the study also said that minority recruitment and enrollment as 
a whole is increasing but black enrollments have been declining at 
a significant rate for years

cardinal john oconnor of new york met with 
government and church leaders on the first day of his visit to this 
communist nation with all sides expressing hope his visit will 
help improve uscuban relations 
oconnor is spending four days in cuba as a guest of the roman 
catholic church to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of 
the rev felix varela the priest who served in new york city from 
1823 to 1853 is considered a cuban hero in the struggle against 
spanish colonial rule 
it is my hope that felix varela will form a bridge a bridge 
between the church in cuba and the church in new york oconnor 
told reporters when he arrived in havana tuesday after stops in 
the dominican republic and the cuban city of santiago 
and who knows when there is a strong bridge between the two 
churches then perhaps many others can go back and forth across 
that bridge oconnor added 
and other kinds of peaceful reunions may take place between 
two people who are separated by such a small body of water and who 
together dream of peace 
oconnor is the first american cardinal to visit this caribbean 
island nation just 90 miles from florida since fidel castro came 
to power in 1959 
the roman catholic prelate was to say mass tonight after a day 
of meetings with church leaders and us officials in havana the 
nature of those talks has not been announced oconnor said earlier 
he could not presume that castro will see him but he would accept 
such an invitation 
at a vatican embassy reception tuesday night oconnor mingled 
with cuban vice president carlos rafael rodriguez archbishop jaime 
ortega and officials of the us interest section a diplomatic 
post set up in havana because there are no formal uscuban 
relations 
rodriguez a member of the communist party politburo echoed 
oconnors comments 
this bridge is necessary not because there are hostile 
relations but because there are none said rodriguez 
he said americans have a false image of cuba and its 
necessary to rectify it i think that the cardinals visit 
contributes to rectifying that image 
oconnor hugged ortega when he got off a plane that carried him 
to the capital from santiago the coastal city in southeastern cuba 
where he began his visit monday 
the cardinal said the thunderous applause he received in 
santiago convinced him that years of religious restrictions in cuba 
had not dampened the spirit of believers in this officially atheist 
nation

kuwaitis hailed the release of 31 hostages and the 
end of the 16day hijacking of a kuwaiti jumbo jet in algeria today 
as a victory for their governments firm stand against terrorism 
the kuwaiti government had steadfastly refused to meet the 
gunmens demand it free 17 convicted proiranian extremists 
the state radio broke into its regular programs to announce the 
release 
ali khaled alsabah a member of kuwaits ruling family and the 
brother of three royal family members among the freed captives 
told the associated press my happiness in indescribable i feel 
as if my brother and two sisters have been resurrected from an 
inevitable doom 
we feel deeply indebted to the kuwaiti leadership and the 
government of algeria he said in a telephone interview 
algerian officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
hijackers left the kuwait airways boeing 747 about 20 minutes 
before the hostages were freed they said the gunmen were taken by 
unmarked cars to an undisclosed location

following tuesdays new york primary victory 
i dont see a deluge said susan brophy who handles 
delegate selection for the campaign

democratic national committee receive their convention credentials 
based on offices they now hold or used to have

the supreme court today upheld a law requiring 
municipal or state bonds issued after june 30 1983 to be 
registered before they can be taxexempt 
the justices by a 71 vote ruled that the federal law enacted 
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does 
not violate any states sovereign immunity 
south carolina had challenged the law arguing that the law will 
hurt state and local governments by forcing them to chose between 
two costly alternatives continue to issue unregistered bonds for 
which investors will have their interest taxed or pay sizeable 
registration fees 
state and local governments issue bonds to finance various 
projects such as building roads and schools 
more than half the states had supported south carolinas 
challenge 
the law which took effect july 1 1983 is aimed in part at 
discouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or are 
passed on to an heir while the interest on government bonds is 
exempt from federal income tax the bonds are taxed as gifts or as 
part of an estate 
in passing the law congress mainly intended to crack down on 
the use of such bonds as an untraceable substitute for cash in 
illegal activities and to make it easier to catch criminals who 
deal in stolen or forged securities 
writing for the court today justice william j brennan said 
a nondiscriminatory federal tax on the interest earned on state 
bonds does not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity 
doctrine 
only justice sandra day oconnor dissented accusing the court 
of overturning a precedent that it has honored for nearly a 
hundred years by making state and municipal bonds subject to 
possible federal taxation 
henceforth the ability of state and local governments to 
finance their activities will depend in part on whether congress 
voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of 
additional incometax revenue 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case 
which is called south carolina vs baker 94 original

unions may distribute handbills urging 
consumers to boycott neutral employers against whom the unions 
have no grievance the supreme court ruled today 
voting 80 in a case from florida the justices said that 
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging 
in secondary boycott picketing of neutral employers it does not 
ban nonpicketing activities aimed at such businesses 
in a separate decision the court ruled by a 62 vote in a 
california case that employers may be forced to provide free 
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at 
organizing employees 
the florida controversy began when the florida gulf coast 
building and construction trades council a union sought to 
publicize its grievances against the high construction co which 
was building a store in the east lake square mall in tampa 
the union alleged that high offered substandard wages and 
benefits 
rather than picket or patrol the mall union members handed out 
literature urging a total consumer boycott of the 85store mall 
after the union refused to modify the handbills to make clear it 
had no dispute with the malls owner or any of the tenant stores 
the edward j debartolo corp which owns the mall filed an unfair 
labor practice claim against the union 
the national labor relations board ruled that the unions action 
was banned by federal law but the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals said that reading labor law to ban such handbilling would 
raise serious constitutional issues 
by reading federal labor law to allow the unions handbilling 
the justices avoided having to decide the constitutional 
freespeech issue presented by the case 
the secondaryboycott prohibitions in federal labor law bar 
unions from using coercion against a neutral employer 
lawyers for the mall owner and the reagan administration argued 
that handing out the handbills at the tampa mall was coercive if 
not on consumers then to owners of the stores inside the mall 
writing for the court today justice byron r white disagreed 
there is no suggestion that the leaflets had any coercive 
effect on the customers of the mall white said there was no 
violence picketing or patrolling and only an attempt to persuade 
customers not to shop inthe mall 
white also agreed with the appeals court that if federal labor 
law banned such union activity serious freespeech questions would 
be raised 
on its face this was expressive activity he said had 
the union simply been leafletting the public generally including 
those entering every shopping mall in town there is little 
doubt that legislative proscription of such leaflets would pose a 
substantial issue of validity under the first amendment 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens 
justices sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia joined in the 
result but not in whites majority opinion 
in the california case the court ruled that the university of 
california must provide free mail delivery on campus for labor 
union literature aimed at organizing university custodial workers 
the justices upheld a decision by the state public employment 
relations board granting the free mail delivery for local 371 of 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
the union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the 
university in 1979 after being denied free use of the intercampus 
mail system at its berkeley campus 
the court in an opinion by oconnor rejected arguments that 
allowing such mail delivery violates a federal law granting the 
us postal service a monopoly 
stevens and marshall cast dissenting votes 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in either case 
the cases are debartolo vs florida gulf coast building and 
construction trades 861461 and regents vs public employment 
relations board 86935

jesse jackson reclaimed a razorthin lead 
today in vermonts seesaw democratic caucuses a stunning comeback 
from his 2to1 loss to michael dukakis in the states beauty 
contest primary last month 
tuesday nights caucus contest was a tight battle throughout the 
night and at times an emotional one burlington mayor bernard 
sanders a jackson supporter was slapped by an irate citizen after 
he cast his vote 
with 97 percent of the votes counted today jackson held an 
eversothin lead over dukakis of 1300 state convention 
delegates jackson had 575 delegates or 46 percent and dukakis 
had 572 or 45 percent albert gore jr had 4 or 0 percent 112 
delegates or 9 percent were uncommitted 
dukakis would win 7 national convention delegates and jackson 7 
if those results held up at the state convention next month 
though his lead was tenuous jacksons supporters hailed his 
showing as a triumph he won the states largest city burlington 
and won many of the states smallest most rural communities as 
well 
its a tremendous victory for us said liz blum the jackson 
state coordinator 
the delegates elected tuesday night will attend next months 
state convention where 14 of vermonts 19 delegates to the 
national convention will be chosen the remaining five spots belong 
to gov madeleine kunin a dukakis backer and four state party 
officials 
jacksons strong showing in the caucuses was a disappointment 
for the dukakis campaign which has most every prominent democrat 
in the state behind it including kunin sen patrick leahy lt 
gov howard dean and house speaker ralph wright 
kunin said the jackson showing was not unexpected and added 
she continues to be very optimistic about dukakis 
i think think his showing in new york is fantastic she 
added dukakis won the big new york contest tuesday by a solid 
margin 
dukakis had won vermonts presidential primary march 1 winning 
56 percent of the vote while jackson gained 26 percent the 
primary was nonbinding and had nothing to do with the selection of 
actual delegates 
based on that showing the dukakis campaign had expected to win 
the caucuses but in recent days his supporters had backed off such 
predictions 
at the end of the night with the tally showing a slight dukakis 
lead william wasserman dukakis state coordinator said im 
delighted that were even one delegate ahead we already knew the 
jackson campaign was well organized 
on the republican side some 1000 delegates to the state gop 
convention were chosen tuesday night with 39 percent of the 
delegates reported george bush had 332 delegates or 89 percent 
with 52 uncommitted delegates and five for pat robertson 
robertsons campaign had hoped to elect enough delegates to give 
them a voice at the state and national conventions but bushs 
vermont spokesman steve watson said the bush forces rallied and 
were able to overcome the robertson forces 
the turnout statewide was extremely high about 670 people 
attended the burlington democratic caucus compared to 435 during 
the 1984 presidential contest 
the burlington caucus provided a fair share of drama and 
tension as many party regulars protested the appearance of mayor 
bernard sanders a socialist who ran for mayor as an independent 
sanders backs jackson 
lyman hunt of burlington who took the podium to speak in 
support of gore said i resent intruders who would undermine and 
destroy the democratic party and voter helen malloy yelled from 
the back of the auditorium we want unity among ourselves not 
with a group of outsiders 
several minutes later she approached sanders as he was 
returning to his seat after casting his vote and slapped him on the 
cheek sanders who at first appeared to think the woman was about 
to greet him looked stunned 
i dont think that was very nice he told her 
malloy later said in a telephone interview that she lost my 
footing i didnt hit him in the face on purpose 
jackson had no paid staff in vermont for either the primary or 
the caucuses but the volunteer staff for the primary was estimated 
at 50 or more 
the dukakis campaign had two professional staffers in vermont 
for the caucuses down from 15 paid staffers and 60 volunteers for 
the preferential primary

michael dukakis today celebrated a resounding 
new york victory that put him on a fast track toward the democratic 
presidential nomination and a fall showdown with republican george 
bush jesse jackson praised dukakis for steering clear of attacks 
in the bitterly divisive primary saying good for him and good 
for america 
sources said sen albert gore jr was ending his presidential 
bid after a poor thirdplace finish behind dukakis and jackson one 
source commenting on condition he not be named said the only 
question was whether gore would formally withdraw or merely suspend 
his campaign in order to retain his delegates 
the tennessee senator scheduled an announcement for thursday in 
washington 
jackson today singled out new york mayor edward koch for blame 
in a campaign in which jackson said people were driven into 
hysteria by negative campaigning against him but he said on 
cbstv that dukakis resisted the temptation to take the campaign 
to the gutter 
dukakis in interviews on nbctv and abctv said i want to 
be a unifier i think we can put it back together im somebody 
who hates the politics of division 
dukakis won 51 percent of the new york vote jackson 37 percent 
and gore 10 percent 
the democratic partys going to be unified and were going to 
stop george bush this november gore said sounding a unity theme 
that must have been music to dukakis ears after two months of 
roughandtumble campaigning 
gore was expected to halt his campaign on thursday he had 
staked everything in new york with an expensive television campaign 
and a sometimes barbtongued effort to pose himself as an 
alternative to dukakis and jackson 
dukakis ended up handily winning the ethnic white vote both 
jewish and catholic jackson had more than 95 percent of the black 
vote and enjoyed a narrow 411903 to 405486 victory over dukakis 
in the precincts of new york city networks said the black vote 
made up 22 to 27 percent of the 15 million statewide democratic 
vote 
victory brought dukakis 164 of new yorks 255 delegates he now 
has 1051 national delegates just over half the 2081 he needs to 
clinch nomination jackson had 89 to bring his total to 841 
vice president george bush continued his roll toward the gop 
nomination and declared dukakis a good bet to be his democratic 
opponent in the fall he said he looked forward to the competition 
and dukakis gave him a taste of the battle to come during a 
philadelphia appearance tuesday evening 
this fall george bush is going to be judged by a legacy of 
pink slips for our workers golden parachutes for high rollers and 
greenmail for sharp operators on wall street said the 
massachusetts governor 
i want to make that american dream come alive again not only 
in trump towers not only in fancy apartments all over this 
country not only in a few privileged neighborhoods 
dukakis flew from philadelphia to a new york victory rally 
within walking distance of trump tower where he told cheering 
supporters i love new york friends if we can make it here we 
can make it anywhere 
gore met with jackson after midnight tuesday jackson aides 
described the meeting as a courtesy call earlier when jackson 
was asked if he might get the senators support he replied i 
dont know what he is going to do but i do respect him very much 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting the vote looked this 
way 
dukakis had 783568 or 51 percent 
jackson had 573112 or 37 percent 
gore had 156052 or 10 percent 
for the two democratic survivors the next battleground is 
pennsylvania next tuesday a state where dukakis was assured of 
winning a major share of the 178 delegates at stake regardless of 
the outcome of a nonbinding presidential preference vote 
we could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates 
lamented jackson delegate coodinator steve cobble dukakis has a 
strong organization in the state while jackson lacks candidates 
for about one third of the delegate slots 
unity was the theme being sounded by democratic candidates and 
party officials after the new york results rolled in 
its a time fo really uniting this party said democratic 
chairman paul g kirk jr 
in iowa we won the bronze dukakis said reading from a text 
at his victory rally in new hampshire we won the gold tonight 
we won the oscar at his side were his wife kitty and his 
oscarwinning cousin actress olympia dukakis 
dukakis said he expected to the remaining contests with jackson 
to remain free of animosity we have a message of hope and 
optimism neither of us believes in cutting up the other guy is a 
way to win elections or the presidency he said 
new york offered 96 republican delegates bush won 91 one was 
going uncommitted and rep jack kemp a buffalobased campaign 
dropout was winning four bush is closing in on the 1139 needed 
to secure his nomination 
new yorkers voted while democratic senators met behind closed 
doors in the capitol to select 43 delegates to the partys national 
convention dukakis won 13 pledges and outdueled gore who gained 
six as well as his own jackson was shut out with the majority of 
senators remaining uncommitted 
in vermont dukakis and jackson fought to a virtual draw with 97 
percent of the vote counted from democratic caucuses dukakis who 
won a nonbinding primary vote march 1 would split with jackson 
the 14 national convention delegates at stake if tuesdays results 
hold up at the state convention bush won going away 
there was widespread agreement that dukakis would be unwise to 
relax his campaign pace and party leaders suggested that jacksons 
fervent supporters in the black community must be persuaded that 
their candidate was in a fair fight to the finish 
during the often raucous new york campaign new york city mayor 
edward koch had no such inhibitions he accused jackson of lying 
under pressure and said jews and other supporters of israel would 
have to be crazy to vote for jackson 
koch supported gore

shiite moslem gunmen slipped out of a 
kuwaiti jet at dawn today reportedly with a promise of safe 
conduct and their 31 hostages were freed ending a 16day 
hijacking ordeal 
the hijackers left algiers for an unknown destination according 
to sources in the persian gulf who spoke to the associated press on 
condition of anonymity the kuwait news agency said no deal was 
made with the hijackers except safe passage to iran or lebanon 
the algerian government had mediated with the hijackers who the 
hostages said numbered about eight but the kuwait news agency said 
numbered nine the government and the hijackers said they reached a 
solution but did not say what it was 
the gunmen had killed two passengers since seizing the kuwait 
airways boeing 747 on april 5 but kuwait refused to bow to the 
hijackers demand that 17 proiranian terrorists imprisoned in 
kuwait be released 
most of the 31 freed hostages were believed to be kuwaiti 
including three members of kuwaits royal family it was reported 
previously that about 35 hostages were aboard the plane 
an official source in kuwait speaking on condition of 
anonymity said algerian foreign minister taleb ibrahimi promised 
the hijackers safe passage when he met with them aboard the plane 
on tuesday 
a 31yearold businessman tadar elkebi said he saw the 
hijackers going through the plane trying to wipe off their 
fingerprints shortly after 4 am today 
this was the first indication i had that our release was 
imminent elkebi said 
the hijackers were whisked out of the jet at about 540 am 
1240 am edt and taken in unmarked cars to an undisclosed 
location said algerian officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the hostages were brought out about 20 minutes later 
floodlights that had bathed the blueandwhite airliner nightly 
since it landed here a week ago were turned off at 9 pm tuesday 
allegedly for a technical reason they never came back on and the 
area around the jet was dark making it difficult for reporters to 
detect any movement 
anware alsabah and ibtesam alsabah second cousins of kuwaits 
emir and the only two women among the hostages were the first to 
descend the gangway from the plane 
the women wearing black veils were escorted to a car and taken 
to a hospital with their brother fadel khaled alsabah who rode 
in an ambulance a doctor said the brother was suffering from a 
nervous disorder 
the rest of the hostages boarded a white bus and cars and waved 
to reporters on the tarmac as they were driven to the airport vip

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken wednesday by the supreme court 
 
alcoholism 
 
the court ruled the government may disqualify military veterans 
who are alcoholics from receiving benefits by viewing their 
condition as willful misconduct rather than an uncontrollable 
disease 
by a 43 vote the justices said the veterans administration in 
denying benefits to two men did not violate a federal law 
protecting the rights of the handicapped 
the court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease but 
said the va is not compelled to regard it as such 
the case is traynor vs turnage 86622 
 
unions 
 
the court ruled that unions may distribute handbills urging 
consumers to boycott neutral employers against whom the unions 
have no grievance

in secondary boycott picketing of neutral employers it does not 
ban nonpicketing activities aimed at such businesses

california case that employers may be forced to provide free 
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at 
organizing employees

the senate finance committee today 
overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan 28 billion welfare overhaul 
that aims to give welfare 
parents more opportunities and incentives to support their 
children 
we have been fighting and struggling for this for a 
quartercentury said sen daniel patrick moynihan dny after 
the panel voted 173 to send his family security act to the 
full senate 
this is a momentous event moynihan said we are 
redefining this 1935 program from a widows pension to a program 
that will bring a generation of young americans back into the 
mainstream of life 
moynihan said he had great hopes that president reagan would 
agree to sign welfare reform legislation despite a letter 
indicating a veto is in the offing 
american taxpayers are unwilling to increase dependency on 
welfare in the name of reform four cabinet members said in the 
letter to members of the senate finance committee we would 
recommend that he the president veto this bill 
the price tag on the fiveyear senate proposal is about 
twothirds the cost of a broader plan passed earlier by the house 
both bills stress parental responsibility through work and child 
support with government aid a last resort for struggling families 
the measures would make the first fundamental changes in the 
welfare system in more than two decades 
the senate plan would require stronger efforts by states to 
collect child support from absent parents states would also have 
to run a jobs education and training program for welfare 
recipients and spend half their money on people considered 
difficult to help participants would receive child care 
transportation and medicaid assistance 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas on tuesday 
called the bill the first step toward a great and worthy goal 
of helping children and their parents lead productive lives he 
said it embodies the best state initiatives and would not increase 
the federal deficit 
the bill includes provisions to raise 2 billion over five years 
by extending the internal revenue services debt collection program 
and 800 million by phasing out child care tax credits for 
upperincome families 
the administration letter to bentsen and other committee members 
was signed by health and human services secretary otis bowen 
agriculture secretary richard lyng labor secretary ann mclaughlin 
and budget director james miller 
the four said the net effect of the moynihan bill would be to 
spend billions of scarce federal dollars on discredited reform 
concepts and untested solutions while adding families to the 
welfare rolls 
administration officials at the work session tuesday objected to 
a number of things in the bill including a requirement that states 
allow welfare payments to twoparent families in which the 
principal wageearner is unemployed the program now is voluntary 
and 26 states have adopted it 
sen william armstrong rcolo tried to strip the requirement 
saying it cost too much was surefire veto bait and there was a 
real difference of opinion on whether the twoparent program was 
desirable 
i thought this was supposed to be the great profamily 
administration said an impatient sen john danforth rmo why 
should the federal government give a penny to any state that is 
rewarding families for splitting up 
the committee rejected sen john chafees attempt to double to 
two years the amount of time medicaid benefits must be available to 
welfare recipients who take lowwage jobs without health insurance 
the amendment failed at least partly because the rhode island 
republican wanted to finance it with a onecentperpack increase 
in the cigarette tax

the family of engineer benjamin linder killed by 
usbacked contra rebels last year in nicaragua today filed a 50 
million suit against top rebel leaders and accused the us state 
department of covering up details of the slaying 
in a news conference here today the family accused the contras 
of having brutally executed linder on april 28 1987 in 
northern nicaragua where he was helping to build a hydroelectric 
plant 
the suit filed in federal court here accused contra directors 
adolfo calero and aristides sanchez and rebel military leaders 
enrique bermudez and indalecia rodriguez with wrongful death 
battery and cruel and inhuman treatment of linder as well as 
the contra organizations themselves 
documents including some obtained through the freedom of 
information act show the 27yearold linder was executed as he lay 
injured on the ground the family said 
we know that ben was murdered dr david linder father of 
the victim said today although our lawsuit cannot bring ben 
back we want to make those responsible pay for their crimes by 
forcing them to pay substantial damages and by exposing their 
guilt to the world 
i would like to know more about the complicity of the reagan 
administration linder said i dont see why they are so 
secretive if they dont know anything about it 
jorge rosales spokesman for the nicaraguan resistance as the 
contras are formally called said today he had no comment yet on 
the suit 
the linders who are from portland ore said their 
investigation shows that despite contra claims to the contrary 
volunteers helping the sandinista government were deliberately 
sought out by the rebels 
bens death was no accident said the father he and his 
coworkers were targeted by the contras because they were bringing 
electricity to poor nicaraguans 
said david linder the orders came from top contra leaders 
who must be brought to justice 
michael ratner attorney for the linders said the us state 
department had refused to cooperate in the familys investigation 
of benjamin linders death 
ratner said he believes the state department coached the contra 
troops in their subsequent statements about the killing he said it 
was possible the us government would be sued separately at a 
later time 
in an autopsy released last june by the family dr michael 
baden said linder had been shot in the head from less than one 
inch after suffering nonfatal wounds in an ambush on the project 
the family today produced a state department memo that indicated 
a physician retained by the department to review the case believed 
there was no doubt benjamin linder was shot at pointblank range 
the contras publicly have said linder was armed and was killed 
in a firefight between rebels and government troops 
the new york times reported last year that the rebels 
acknowledged the killing privately and said linder was mistaken for 
a cuban adviser to the sandinistas 
the linders said they will be represented in the case by the new 
yorkbased center for constitutional rights 
the family also said they will leave friday for nicaragua where 
they will participate in activities commemorating the anniversary 
of linders death and deliver a check for 250000 to complete the 
development project linder was working on when he was killed

secretary of state george p shultz 
today denounced the hijackers of a kuwaiti jumbo jet as murderers 
and said freeing them would violate international standards 
the hijackers left algeria for an unknown destination today 
after their 31 hostages were freed said sources in the persian 
gulf who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they are not only hijackers but murderers shultz said at a 
news conference in helsinki where he stopped en route to moscow to 
prepare for the may 29june 2 summit 
the kuwait news agency said the gunmen who seized the plane 
april 5 were promised safe passage to iran or lebanon 
shultz said his reports from algiers were fragmentary and he did 
not want to secondguess the algerian government which negotiated 
with the gunmen 
but he said the hijackers committed two distinct crimes seizing 
the airplane and killing the two kuwaitis whose bodies were dumped 
from the jetliner in cyprus last week 
from the standpoint of the international community we dont 
like to see hijackers go off free shultz said i dont think 
thats a proper thing to do 
kuwait thanked algeria for its intercession in the past the 
united states also has expressed gratitude to governments that 
assist in ending hostage crises but shultz did not do so 
shultz said the united states would not seek to extradite the 
hijackers if none of the hostages was american 
but charles e redman the state department spokesman said one 
passenger might have held dual citizenship and shultz said one of 
the gunmen may have been involved in the hijacking of a twa 
jetliner in 1985 in which a us navy diver was killed 
shultz will open three days of talks in moscow on thursday with 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and meet with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
on shultzs agenda are the iraniraq war which threatens 
shipping in the persian gulf and ussoviet negotiations to 
conclude a treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons arsenals by 30 
to 50 percent 
shultz said he would appeal anew to the soviets to agree to 
impose an arms embargo against iran through the un security 
council 
with soviet support the council called for a ceasefire in the 
war in the gulf last july but us efforts to overcome iranian 
resistance with sanctions have been stymied by moscow 
a us official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity said the soviets might change their minds he said 
shevardnadze had discussed the issue tuesday with jack matlock the 
us ambassador and his attitude was barely negative 
shultz said tuesday the united states does not intend to be 
drawn into the persian gulf war but is determined to defend its 
ships against iranian attack 
he said it was difficult to analyze irans motives in attacking 
ships in the persian gulf and firing on us vessels and aircraft 
on monday given vastly superior us firepower 
shultz said the iranian mine that damaged the us frigate 
samuel b roberts in the gulf last week prompting the navys 
retaliatory raid on two iranian oil platforms monday may have been 
laid carelessly 
the navy sank or damaged six iranian warships monday 
shultz said he had no information to link israel to the 
assassination of khalil alwazir a top official of the palestine 
liberation organization 
he said the killing did not appear to be an act of terrorism 
which he said has a random characteristic with the attackers 
striking at innocent civilians 
this was a different kind of action which doesnt mean we 
dont condemn it he said 
alwazir military commander of the plo was killed saturday in 
his home in tunisia by masked commandos a tunisian inquiry 
concluded israel conducted the attack 
israeli sources confirmed privately to the associated press that 
israeli forces killed alwazir the israeli government has not 
confirmed this

a federal appeals court today cleared the 
way for the internal revenue service to revoke the ptl television 
ministrys taxexempt status 
the irs wants to revoke ptls exempt status in part because ptl 
had used contributions to fund the lavish lifestyles of jim bakker 
and his wife tammy said irs lawyer francis allegra 
officials of the ministry bakker founded had argued that loss of 
taxexempt status could scuttle efforts to reorganize the ministry 
by a federal bankruptcy courts may 1 deadline 
bakker resigned from ptl after a scandal over a sexual encounter 
with former church secretary jessica hahn 
attorneys for the irs seeking to make the revocation 
retroactive to may 31 1981 said ptl owes the government from 55 
million to 82 million in back taxes 
todays unanimous ruling from a threejudge panel of the 4th 
us circuit court of appeals affirmed a decision by us district 
judge karen l henderson of columbia sc 
henderson had found that the bankruptcy court handling the ptl 
reorganization did not have the authority to prevent the irs from 
lifting the ministrys taxexempt status 
although a revocation may potentially obstruct the orderly 
administration in bankruptcy we decline to create and exception 
in the absence of expressed congressional intent the panel 
said 
r bradford leggett a ptl attorney had argued before the 
appeals panel on march 31 that loss of taxexempt status would 
jeopardize the ministrys ability to reorganize by the bankruptcy 
courts may 1 deadline 
the ministry based in fort mill sc is engaged in a march 
to victory telethon to raise 42 million by may 1 ptl has debts 
estimated at 60 million

april 14 
the daily astorian astoria ore on the war against drugs 
one of the most surprising aspects of the reagan administration 
is that it has lost the war on drugs 
despite all of the talk and all of the money spent the results 
of the administrations assault on narcotics trafficking have been 
dismal 
cocaine shipments into the united states have soared during 
reagans presidency and the number of drug users in the united 
states remains near its alltime peak

atlanta constitution on larry speakes and presidential quotes 
former white house press officer larry speakes admission that 
he attempted to spruce up the presidents image by taking a bit 
of liberty with my pr mans license has created an uproar and no 
wonder 
the statements speakes attributed to president reagan one 
lifted from the lips of secretary of state george shultz and one 
fabricated by speakes were fairly innocuous in and of 
themselves 
but the practice if it had become routine and we have only 
speakes word suggesting that it didnt could have led to all 
sorts of unintended difficulties 
thats especially so in foreign affairs where the presidents 
spokesman could by putting the wrong spin on a statement easily 
create mistaken even damaging impressions 
the wonder of it all is that the president was ignorant of what 
was going on or if he wasnt that he acquiesced in the 
deception but either way it would fit an all too familiar 
pattern in this white house

the greenwood miss commonwealth on larry speakes and 
presidential quotes 
larry speakes is a distinguished mississippi son and the whole 
state will grieve with him over his bad fortune in this flap over 
manufactured presidential quotes 
speakes lived for years under intense pressure in the demanding 
role of white house spokesman under constant questioning by the 
press before the eyes of the world and he didnt make a serious 
blunder 
in his book speakes said that he was clearly wrong to have 
created the quotes but said his intention was to spruce up the 
presidents image by taking a bit of liberty with the pr mans 
license 
of course thats precisely that the washington press corps 
accuses white house spokesmen of doing it also is precisely what 
speakes when he was press secretary denied he was doing 
truthfulness then now and in the future must be the goal of 
white house spokesmen when a spokesmans credibility is damaged 
he loses his usefulness

the significance of the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan after 
more than eight years of war is not lost on but probably wont be 
advertised by democratic leaders of congress 
defeat of the soviet union is directly linked to the reagan 
doctrines commitment of military support to insurgents who take on 
communist regimes around the globe 
the fighting between opposing afghan factions likely will 
continue in order to establish a new islamic government an 
independent nonaligned government in kabul must remain the

the baltimore sun on the inf treaty 
was reagan administration testimony on the inf treaty banning 
intermediaterange nuclear forces authoritative and binding on 
future amdinistrations 
curiously enough reagan officials find themselves arguing 
vociferously that it was not that senate efforts to give their 
interpretations permanence amount to a legislative assault on 
executive prerogatives 
what brought this issue to the fore is a persistent reagan 
effort to discard nixon administration testimony on the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty and to offer a broader interpretation 
that would permit spacebased testing of the strategic defense 
initiative 
last year congress turned to its power of the purse to cut off 
funds for tests that nixon testimony would bar 
but reagan officials have returned to the fray even if it means 
putting the inf treaty and the coming summit at risk 
we believe an administration that negotiates a treaty should 
offer testimony that the senate can rely upon in giving its assent 
to ratification

lawrence kan journalworld on larry speakes and presidential 
quotes 
so a former white house press secretary has been caught in the 
act 
scandalous other press secretaries past and present have 
decried larry speakes actions and stated flatly that they would 
have nothing to do with such behavior the vehemence of their 
protest almost makes one wonder if they might have something to 
hide 
speakes was merely telling the press what the president thought 
in a way that the president never objected to 
he probably was wrong to represent some of those views as 
verbatim quotes but it wasnt as if he was misrepresenting the 
presidents opinion on the issues 
its doubtful that speakes was the first press secretary to 
fabricate some golden quotations for the president

was slipped in for the warnerlambert co its patent on lopid a

the bill would extend warnerlamberts patent for 3 years with

be dandy for the companys bottom line

the seattle times on contra drug dealing 
a political time bomb ticks away as a senate subcommittee 
investigating narcotics and terrorism raises unavoidable questions 
about reagan administration knowledge of contra drug dealing 
former diplomats senior military commanders excontra 
chieftains and convicted drug dealers paint an ugly picture of a 
pretend war against the cocaine lords 
in many cases a veneer of anticommunism was reason enough to 
tolerate affiliations with drug traffickers 
in short maintaining support for the antisandinista contras 
was more important to the administration than resolutely saying no 
to drugs 
how these compromises will play out in 1988 presidential 
politics is unknown but the testimony and evidence presented to 
the committee should sicken north americans whose daily lives are 
tormented by drugs in their homes or neighborhoods

los angeles herald examiner on fighting drug trafficking 
in a meaningless show of looking tough on drug trafficking the 
senate voted april 14 to sanction mexico for not doing enough to 
stop the flow of cocaine across its border into the united states 
but the senators or at least 63 of them didnt acknowledge 
that the border has two sides and that the united states is 
supposed to be looking after one of them 
nor did they seem swayed by the reality that shutting off 
drugfighting money to a strapped nation would only strengthen the 
drug lords 
against great odds mexico has begun cracking down on smuggling 
and corruption among officials responsible for enforcement for a 
poor nation beset with a plethora of serious problems such action 
is especially heartening 
but here in the prosperous united states where the drug market 
is theres been only token action 
if senators want to do something about drugs the list of 
suitable actions is longer than the usmexico border bashing our 
neighbors for the sake of a headline wont make a dent in the

colleagues much too soon after leaving the white house

body outside suttons bedroom window the window screen resting on 
his legs 
the murder charge against the black youth sparked protests from 
people who said the case was no different from that of a 
11yearold white boy todd knight who only days earlier shot and 
killed two intruders into his home in switzer and earned widespread 
praise for justifiable homicide 
suttons mother irene jones said her son was overjoyed with 
the news that the charge was dropped i believe he can get back 
to a normal life he was under a lot of pressure she said 
spartanburg city police capt john lee said the charges were 
filed because sutton did not give dawkins a warning to leave did 
not attempt to escape and did not call police before firing the 
shots 
lee said the charges were dismissed by magistrate georgia 
anderson at gossetts request and in concert with police 
investigators 
the 1923 law gossett cited applies to deaths in which the 
occupant is the slayer and stands on the right to protect 
habitation if he is in his own house and he determines a 
trespasser is committing a felonious act 
sutton a spartanburg high school sophomore told police that 
someone rang the doorbell at his home four times several hours 
after his mother had left for work 
he was too frightened to answer but fired the fatal shot 
through his blindcovered bedroom window when he heard someone 
trying to remove the screen the teenager told police 
sutton was charged with murder and spent oneandahalf days in 
jail before his 2500 bond was set by a circuit court judge 
it was unfortunate that this young man had to go through what 
he went through lee added

other bones of people massacred earlier this decade possibly for a 
memorial or museum officials said wednesday

triangle where about 200000 people are believed to have been 
slaughtered between 1980 and 1985 by troops of ousted civilian 
president milton obote the victims were accused of backing a rebel 
movement of president yoweri museveni who seized power january 
1986 from the military junta that overthrew obote 
when residents who had fled the region returned home after 
musevenis victory they collected the scattered bones and piled 
them up all over the area paul wamala chief consultant at the 
government department of antiquities and museums said he knew of 
no other place in the world where human skulls are so openly 
displayed 
the skulls haunt people and they are an embarrassment to the 
countrys visitors said wamala 
in addition to using the bones in a memorial or museum wamala 
said the government is considering simply storing them

president corazon aquino on wednesday 
relieved the philippine commander of her countrys us military 
bases which are the subject of ongoing joint talks 
mrs aquino ordered armed forces chief gen renato de villa to 
step down from his post as commander of us bases in the 
philippines the presidential palace announced 
although the philippine government technically commands the six 
us installations they are controlled by the united states 
it was not clear how the move might affect negotiations on 
renewing the agreement allowing the united states to operate the 
bases philippine officials said it would have no bearing 
defense secretary fidel ramos said he recommended the chief of 
staff be relieved as commander of us bases because the position 
entails additional responsibilities for an already busy man and can 
be filled by an officer with a much lower rank ramos said the 
philippine commander of the bases should be an officer with a rank 
not higher than the commanders of the us facilities 
no replacement was named

the white house today expressed concern over 
delays in ratifying a ussoviet nucleararms treaty and said it 
would be most unfortunate if the agreement were not approved by 
the time president reagan goes to moscow for summit talks 
the treaty which requires the elimination of mediumrange 
nuclear weapons has been stalled by a number of issues most 
recently the question of whether futuristic weapons are banned by 
the pact 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said a failure to ratify 
the treaty by the time reagan meets with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev may 29june 2 would be a setback to ongoing negotiations 
to curb strategic nuclear weapons under a socalled start treaty 
fitzwater said that to have the mediumrange weapon treaty 
ratified before the summit would be an important boost to our 
negotiations on the start treaty 
similarly if its not ratified it would tend to dampen i 
think the prospects for serious start progress it would not be 
helpful and we would hope that the ccongress would be able to 
ratify it before we go 
the treaty is not expected to come to the senate floor until may 
9 at the earliest leaving only 2 weeks before reagans departure 
sen sam nunn dga said tuesday that the question about 
futuristic weapons is still unanswered despite a statement by a top 
soviet official 
i think the question still needs clarification and theres got 
to be some more work done on this issue he said 
fitzwater said the issues raised in the senate are all 
important and they certainly deserve clarification we believe they 
have received it 
the administration argues that the treaty will not affect 
development of futuristic weapons 
as nunn expressed his reservations the house was voting 3937 
in favor of a nonbinding resolution approving the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the vote has no effect on the senate which has exclusive 
constitutional authority to ratify treaties 
nunn commented a day after the state department forwarded to the 
senate the transcipt of a letter by soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze to secretary of state george p shultz 
in the letter shevardnadze said the soviets agree with the 
united states that the inf treaty signed last dec 8 bans 
futuristic weapons such as lasers or beam weapons 
the treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to 
3400 miles but nunn and other senators have questioned how the 
pact0would affect weapons in that range0dlatcoumd be1d

an associated press reporter was taken on a tour 
of the faw peninsula by the iraqi military and filed the following 
report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
iraqi troops who recaptured this 
strategic peninsula from iran found heavily shelled buildings 
plastered with pictures of iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini and antiiraqi slogans 
they also discovered piles of islamic religious books many 
written by khomeini that iranian soldiers left behind in an 
apparently hasty retreat 
an iraqi general told reporters here tuesday that iraqi forces 
had completely dislodged iranian troops from the faw peninsula 
recapturing territory seized by iran 26 months ago hundreds of 
iranian prisoners were shown to reporters 
other iraqi reports on wednesday acknowledged that pockets of 
iranian resistance remained on the peninsula 
the general speaking at his command post near the oil refinery 
city of faw identified himself only as a representative of the 
iraqi high command the reporters were the first to reach the faw 
peninsula since it was recaptured 
the general spoke as iraqis were building new fortifications 
after recapturing the triangle of land at the southern tip of their 
country it was the first major iraqi offensive since 1986 in the 
7yearold persian gulf war 
hundreds of military vehicles headed toward faw on tuesday to 
reinforce elite presidential guard units that spearheaded the 
36hour assault sunday and monday 
the city of faw which reporters visited 15 hours after the 
iranians were driven out was quiet there were however sporadic 
shellings which iraqis said came from new iranian positions in 
thick palm groves on the eastern bank of the shatt alarab 
waterway the southern border between iran and iraq 
ration storage areas had been left intact suggesting a speedy 
iranian retreat 
iraqi military officials said many weapons were seized without 
giving numbers reporters saw ammunition left intact in storage 
depots 
about 250 iranian prisonersofwar were shown to reporters and 
many of them talked about being surprised by the iraqi offensive 
one iranian prisoner mohammed idage 49 said he was in a 
bunker which provided shelter from iraqi shells when he was 
caught by iraqi soldiers 
i thought the iraqis were too far away and nobody told us 
that they were approaching so rapidly he said it was a real 
surprise to see iraqis all around the bunker 
the general said the offensive was launched to regain control of 
the 35 squaremile triangle of territory occupied by iran in 
february 1986 he said the iraqi air force and navy joined ground 
forces in the operation 
he also denied iranian charges that iraq used the nearby kuwaiti 
island of bubiyan as a staging position for part of the offensive 
the iranians are trying to conceal their crimes against our 
brothers in kuwait and their hijacking of the kuwait aircraft he 
said 
he referred to claims that iran was behind the hijacking of a 
kuwait airways jumbo jet which took the plane to iran cyprus and 
algeria before it ended wednesday 
as the general spoke a powerful explosion rocked the ground 
nearby 
not to worry its outgoing said an iraqi captain the 
iranians are there he said pointing to the date palms across 
the waterway 
he said iraqi troops continued to shell those positions in a bid 
to prevent any reorganization of iranian troops

un efforts to end the iraniraq war 
already near collapse suffered another setback from this weeks 
persian gulf military confrontation between the united states and 
iran 
the security council passed a resolution july 20 demanding an 
immediate ceasefire in the 7yearold war but iran has accepted 
it only with reservations 
since the resolution was passed the war has intensified with 
missile attacks on cities by both sides that have killed hundreds 
of people a new iranian push into iraqi territory on the northern 
front and reports that iraq has used chemical weapons 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar gave the council a 
gloomy picture last week of his four rounds of talks with iranian 
and iraqi envoys concluding that their positions were 
insufficient for a ceasefire 
on tuesday he expressed grave concern about further escalation 
of the war the 15member council has been deliberating informally 
on how or whether its resolution can be enforced 
diplomats said privately the us campaign for a council arms 
embargo on iran was undermined by us navy attacks on two iranian 
oil platforms monday and ensuing operations in which six iranian 
naval vessels were sunk or disabled 
they said the confrontation made it less likely that governments 
would take sides with washington to punish iran for what now 
appears to be a conflict with a superpower 
the soviet union which has delayed action on an embargo 
condemned the us attacks and the diplomats said soviet suport for 
a ban on arms sales to iran had become unlikely 
us officials said however that they hope the clash between 
the us and iranian navies will help break a security council 
impasse 
we think this proves more strongly than ever the need for an 
enforcement resolution imposing a weapons ban on iran us 
ambassador herbert s okun said monday after briefing the council 
on events in the gulf 
washington said its actions were necessary and proportionate 
response to an iranian threat and legitmate selfdefense the oil 
platforms were attacked as retaliation for a mine that damaged a 
us navy frigate last week and wounded 10 sailors 
iran vowed retaliation against the united states and ambassador 
mohammad mahallati said tuesday 
the american aggression has strongly and substantially 
weakened the security council resolution and violated its call for 
restraint by all states 
resolution 598 demands an immediate ceasefire and troop 
withdrawal outlines a peace plan and calls for enforcement 
measures it was seen in july as a rare example of un toughness 
and a test of its ability to put teeth in demands for an end to the 
war 
iraq has said it accepts the resolution but iran wants the 
ceasefire linked to identification of iraq as the aggressor iraq 
invaded iran in september 1980 after several border skirmishes

john shepherd the man attorney general edwin 
meese had picked to become his deputy formally withdrew his name 
from consideration today saying my wife and i were not prepared 
for the pressures to which he would be subjected 
meese had announced april 5 that shepherd a st louis attorney 
was his choice to become deputy attorney general replacing arnold 
burns who announced march 29 he was leaving and whose last day on 
the job will be friday 
shepherd in a statement said he had felt it was his duty to 
accept meeses offer without hesitation 
but he added i am concerned about the personal and financial 
sacrifices my family and i were being asked to make in order to 
accept a very difficult shortterm appointment my wife and i were 
not prepared for the pressures to which someone recommended for 
this position at this time would be subjected 
he said he and meese had discussed his predicament and while 
i am pleased to learn that there is no obstacle to my nomination i 
have asked him to withdraw my name from consideration 
meese in a statement of his own said regrettably intense 
media attention on mr shepherds impending nomination has had a 
severe impact on him and his family 
shortly before meese recommended shepherd for the justice 
department post a former bookkeeper from shepherds law firm 
testified that she had had an affair with shepherd the bookkeeper 
who was convicted of embezzlement claimed shepherd had told her to 
write checks to herself shepherd denied that he had an affair with 
her or that he had authorized her to write checks 
in addition it was disclosed after meeses april 5 announcement 
that shepherd belonged to an allmale club and to an allwhite 
country club 
but meese said that all the information raised in the media 
since he was named was known to the white house and the justice 
department in advance and has been fully investigated by the fbi in 
its background review 
there is nothing whatsoever to suggest that mr shepherd would 
have had any confirmation problems meese said 
shepherd earlier had been recommended for a job in the justice 
department by e robert wallach a longtime meese friend now under 
indictment in the wedtech scandal sources said today 
the sources who requested anonymity said wallach had proposed 
shepherds name for an unspecified post in 1984 or 1985 
department sources said that meese has been trying since the 
beginning of the week to fill the post that shepherd was to have 
taken following shepherds discussion with the attorney general 
last friday in which the former american bar association president 
said he had reservations about taking the job 
burns in announcing his resignation said he was doing so out 
of concern that the nearly yearlong criminal investigation of meese 
was affecting the justice departments operations morale and 
public image 
shepherd 62 was meeses second choice to take burns place 
the attorney general was rebuffed by philadelphia lawyer and former 
federal judge arlin adams who said earlier this month that he had 
a heavy caseload at his law firm and pointed out that he had just 
joined the firm last year 
meese has also not found a replacement for assistant attorney 
general william weld head of the criminal division who resigned 
with burns 
meanwhile more justice department deputies are leaving their 
posts in an exodus sparked by meeses legal problems virtually 
emptying the departments no 2 office 
the resignations and transfers make it increasingly difficult 
for meese to recover from the wave of departures 
the three top aides to burns are quitting the government or 
transferring to new jobs department sources said tuesday that all 
three rejected overtures by meese aides to remain at justice after 
burns and weld quit 
it is customary for the deputy attorney general to pick his own 
assistants but the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said meeses staff tried to keep top deputies posts filled 
following the resignations of burns and weld 
in addition deputies posts in departments no 3 office are 
vacant due to the departure of associate attorney general stephen 
trott who is now a federal judge 
in burns office raymond b ludwiszewski an associate deputy 
attorney general who came to the justice department in 1985 has 
handed in his resignation and is negotiating with private 
washington law firms for work 
paul cassell a burns deputy who dealt with issues involving the 
departments criminal and antitrust divisions is transferring to 
the us attorneys office in alexandria va where he will become 
an assistant us attorney 
in a move that has been in the planning stages for some time 
associate deputy attorney general gregory walden is to become chief 
counsel to the federal aviation administration one of the 
departments top experts in the ongoing criminal investigations of 
former philippines president ferdinand marcos walden will leave 
the justice department in a few weeks

andy warhols huge and varied personal 
collection goes on sale this week offering a chance to see and 
buy the paintings and pottery owned by the man who brought 
campbells soup to fine art 
some say the sale provides a prime opportunity to learn what 
made the artist tick if so the lesson wont be easy 
confronted with the 10000 items on the block ranging from 
navajo blankets to edgar degas sculpture to 134 cookie jars to a 
rolls royce to a superman touchtone telephone a student of the 
world according to warhol could be forgiven for resorting to cliff 
notes 
warhol went shopping six days a week bless his heart said 
john l marion chairman of sothebys north america and its chief 
auctioneer 
he was interested in form and shape and various things that 
fascinated him marion said and apparently it fascinated him 
more to search out and acquire than it did ever to admire 
warhol who died at 58 in february 1987 was not known as a 
spendthrift so there must have been some method that led him to 
accumulate thousands of objects from a federal fourposter bed to a 
cache of bakelite baubles and to horde silver and plastic in equal 
measure 
marion knew warhol for 25 years yet he had no idea the artist 
had such an impressive collection of american classical 
19thcentury furniture or art deco furniture or silver of such 
quality the auctioneer says that its like has never appeared at 
auction before 
when marion lifts his gavel saturday he will open one of 
sothebys longest sales ever for a single collection 10 days the 
sixvolume catalog compiled by an unprecedented 22 departments is 
sothebys costliest at 95 and its heaviest at 8 pounds 
sothebys budgeted at least 500000 to promote the sale and 
marion says im sure thats been exceeded road shows 
exhibited portions of the collection in eight cities in four 
countries there were exclusive cocktail parties in warhols 
manhattan townhouse 
for the first time in its history sothebys will hold a sunday 
bidding session giving ordinary people a shot at some of the more 
affordable collectibles the auction house even printed a leaflet 
for neophytes explaining how to bid the first days viewing drew 
6000 browsers three times the normal 
officially the sale is expected to bring in 10 million to 15 
million but sothebys says the estimates are based on market value 
without the warhol factor that could boost prices proceeds go 
to the andy warhol foundation for the visual arts 
this sale offers a bit of warhol for just about everyone the 
estimates range from 5075 for a campbell kid soup bowl 
inscribed andy to 350000450000 for a jasper johns oil 
painting titled screen piece 
there are works by warhol contemporaries including johns roy 
lichtenstein and cy twombly and others by such artists as 
pierreauguste renoir and henri de toulouselautrec 
theres a 19thcentury chippendale style pine chest estimated at 
300400 and a fine chippendale mahogany camelback sofa 
expected to fetch 100 times as much 
more than 1000 pieces of jewelry are on sale warhol collected 
everything from bakelite bracelets to ruby and diamond earrings 
i never saw him wear a single jewel wrote suzie frankfurt 
in the catalog until one night at studio 54 i saw a slight 
bulge under his brooks brothers shirt which turned out to be a 
rather grand emerald necklace so i suppose he occasionally wore 
them in secret 
there are also more than 300 watches from cartier to popeye 
during the years that i knew andy he only wore one watch a 
womans gold midseventies rolex wrote rupert smith 
warhols outstanding art deco collection includes a spectacular 
series of silver tea and coffee services the artist himself 
reportedly preferred to dine on fiesta ware that too is on the 
block 
some like paige powell a friend of warhol and advertising 
director of his interview magazine say this diverse and varied lot 
offers a unique insight into the artist and shouldnt be divided 
warhol was by far the most important artist in the 20th 
century powell said the importance of his collection will 
grow as time goes on even king tut is a good parallel 
powell wrote to at least 30 art patrons and other billionaires 
seeking someone to bid for the entire collection so far shes had 
no luck 
marion however said there would be no purpose in keeping the 
collection together and maintains warhol would have adored the 
auction

unemployment in hungary has risen from 
10000 jobless last year to 30000 and is expected to go up by 
another 19000 yet this year a labor official was quoted as saying 
wednesday 
csaba halmos president of the national office for wages and 
labor also said 10000 jobs will be created this year 
according to the communist party daily nepszabadsag which 
carried halmos remarks the labor official said about 700000 
people change jobs each year out of hungarys work force of 5 
million 
rising unemployment in hungary is largely a consequence of 
austerity measures introduced by the government that include 
streamlining or closing companies that chronically lose money 
halmos was quoted as saying 19000 jobs probably would be 
eliminated this year 
he said unemployment was likely to increase but called for 
caution in claiming it could rise to 100000 to 150000 according 
to official estimates there could be as many as 200000 jobless by 
1990 
halmos however predicted 100000 to 150000 new jobs could be 
created in restructured factories or in private enterprise and 
cooperatives he gave no timetable for such a development 
about 10000 workers received retraining last year and found 
new jobs nepszabadsag quoted halmos as saying 
according to statistics published in january 70 percent of 
hungarys jobless are unskilled workers who find it harder to find 
employment

a sweeping education bill expanding services 
to the nations students won final congressional approval today 
but a section outlawing pornographic telephone messages seemed sure 
to wind up in court 
the senate passed the multibilliondollar education measure on a 
voice vote and sent it to the white house for president reagans 
expected signature 
the house pasesd the bill tuesday on a 3971 vote but only 
after a series of complicated maneuvers to attach a ban on 
dialaporn phone services rep philip crane rill was the lone 
member voting no 
no court has ever upheld a complete ban on nonobscene 
socalled indecent speech said barry lynn legislative counsel 
to the american civil liberties union he said the ban born of 
concern for children intrudes on the privacy and freespeech 
rights of american adults 
the hawkinsstafford school improvement act authorizes up to 
83 billion in spending next year on elementary and secondary 
school programs with more than half the money going to 
disadvantaged children at risk of failing 
it contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high 
school students with weak skills and greatly expands drug abuse 
education and magnet schools new money also was earmarked for 
math science and foreignlanguage programs 
this is one of the most important bills that we will ever 
pass one that we want to pass if we want to be competitive said 
rep william goodling rpa a former school superintendent 
the bill a compromise between the versions passed by the house 
and senate was named for rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman 
of the house education and labor committee and retiring sen 
robert stafford rvt former chairman of the senate education 
subcommittee 
passed with only one dissenting vote in each chamber the bill 
would have glided through housesenate negotiations and through the 
house except for the telephone pornography ban grafted onto the 
senate measure by sen jesse helms rnc 
negotiators had agreed on a compromise under which telephone 
customers in most of the country would not have access to the lewd 
messages unless an adult called the phone company to request a 
hookup the compromise ultimately was killed and the helms ban 
restored 
the largest single program in the school improvement act is 
chapter 1 which pays for tutoring and other services to 
disadvantaged children at risk of academic failure school 
districts could receive basic grants totaling up to 47 billion in 
fiscal year 1989 a 400 million increase over current spending 
fiscal 1989 initiatives in the bill include 50 million for 
even start to jointly educate poor preschool children and 
their illiterate parents 50 million for dropout prevention 
demonstration projects and 200 million to improve basic skills of 
high school students 
the act also includes the following major programs with 
authorized 1989 funding levels that represent the maximum congress 
could appropriate 
580 million for the education block grant of which at least 
80 percent goes to local school districts current spending is 508 
million 
250 million for the math and science education program 
designed to improve critical skills in those areas about twice as 
much as current spending 
250 million for drug abuse education programs 30 million 
higher than current spending 
200 million for bilingual education more than 50 million 
higher than current spending 
200 million for adult education some 75 million higher than 
current spending 
165 million for magnet schools which encourage racial 
integration by providing special curriculums current spending is 
at 72 million 
the bill also authorizes smaller amounts of money for a variety 
of other programs including foreign language training and 
upgrades the education departments statistical division

the wife of presidential candidate albert gore 
jr raised controversy when she spearheaded a campaign to put 
warning labels on rock music albums with sexually explicit lyrics 
but another presidential contender jesse jackson was 
treading the same ground long before tipper gore made headlines 
jackson in 1977 put on a music and morality conference at 
his operation push in chicago urging that voluntary standards be 
drawn up by the record industry and radio stations newspaper 
clippings show 
we hope this conference will send a message to the industry 
because chicago is such a major market jackson was quoted as 
telling the chicago tribune like mrs gore jackson said he was 
not advocating censorship he said he wanted voluntary standards 
by the radio stations and by the record companies themselves 
love and romance are part of life and we are not suggesting 
that these subjects should be censored in record lyrics jackson 
wrote in a letter published in the newspaper on may 28 1977 
our appeal has been directed toward pornographic lyrics that 
degrade human sexuality rather than uplifting the human spirit 
jackson said a recording at the time lets make a baby was 
one in a whole series increasingly explicit and dominant in a 
market almost exclusively directed at children 
he called on the record industry to assess the state of the 
art 
mrs gore created an uproar in the music industry and cost her 
husband some support among the hollywood set with her crusade 
against sex drugs and violence in music over the past few years 
tipper gore a cofounder of the parents music resource center 
testified before the senate commerce committee of which her 
husband was a member in 1985 about what the group felt was the 
danger of explicit lyrics 
the recording industry association of america later reached an 
uneasy agreement with the center stating its members would place 
warning labels on recordssuch as explicit lyrics parental 
advisory 
mrs gore s leadership brought opposition from such 
entertainers as frank zappa he disagreed with mrs gores 
assertion that lyrics could promote deviant behavior saying i 
wrote a song aboiut dental floss but anyones teeth get cleaner 
jackson has not made rock music a part of his campaign or 
speeches but he frequently speaks against babies making babies 
and urges young people not to waste their minds with drugs 
in his 1977 letter to the tribune he said the crusade against 
sexrock was part of operation pushs educational arm 
pushexcel which was aimed at motivating young people to study

michael dukakis the undisputed frontrunner at 
last in a twoman race for the democratic presidential nomination 
remained ever cautious on wednesday and said nothing in this 
world is certain 
dukakis met with rival jesse jackson early wednesday to receive 
congratulations on a sweeping new york primary victory but the 
massachusetts governor declined to meet with loser albert gore jr 
citing the press of state business in boston 
dukakis flew back to boston after an early morning meeting with 
reporters and was taking a days respite from campaigning he 
resumes the democratic campaign thursday in ohio and pennsylvania 
although his victory was broad and impressive dukakis faced 
repeated questions about his dispassionate campaign style and polls 
showing that large numbers of democrats longed for some other 
candidate to be in the race despite his convincing victory here 
im somebody who i think tends to grow on people as they get 
to know me dukakis responded 
as it continues to go on well see stronger and stronger and 
more intense support but obviously for many people im a 
relatively new acquaintance and its going to take a while to 
build that kind of support he said 
dukakis big victory and gores failure left the governor with a 
strong lead in delegates although he acknowledged a delegate 
majority was not yet within his reach but new york pared gore from 
the field making it hard to envision dukakis failing to win the 
nomination 
campaign manager paul brountas said new yorks returns would 
encourage uncommitted delegates and those still backing losers to 
move toward dukakis but he said the campaign was not trying to 
produce a visible stampede of support within the party such a big 
move too soon could risk alienating jackson supporters that the 
nominee needs in november 
dukakis said a oneonone race with jackson will be conducted 
without division or attacks he predicted that by the end of the 
primaries in june i doubt either one of us will have a numerical 
majority of delegates 
but i hope i have a substantial lead and the kind of lead that 
will then make it possible for me to unite the party to produce a 
clear majority he said 
dukakis said he was unable to meet with gore who was poised to 
withdraw at an announcement thursday in washington 
he called a gore withdrawal something he has to decide but 
said he would help gore raise money to eliminate a campaign debt 
that approaches 2 million 
he said gore who launched strong attacks on dukakis as naive 
and inexperienced in foreign policy wanted to meet this morning 
and i just couldnt do it 
ive got to get back to boston ive got to get a very 
important meeting of my anticrime council and a very full 
agenda and i just had to get back there but im sure well be 
talking hes a good guy and ive enjoyed getting to know him and i 
respect him 
he did meet with jackson and later said it was too early to 
say what role he sees for jackson asked if he would consider 
jackson as his running mate dukakis said i wouldnt rule 
anything in or out at this point 
hes obviously an important leader in our party and in our 
country we respect each other he said 
dukakis refused to claim the role as likely nominee saying 
nothing in this world is inevitable and weve got much to do

morton thiokol conducted a fullscale 
test of a space shuttle booster rocket with deliberately flawed 
seals today to see whether hot gases would penetrate the joints as 
they did when the challenger exploded 
it looked good weve got to wait and see the data but you 
always like to see it go off on time and see it run 120 seconds 
said jr thompson director of nasas marshall space flight 
center in huntsville ala 
if we get good results then well press on at the cape he 
said referring to preparations for a midaugust launch of the 
shuttle discovery at cape canaveral 
the twominute firing of the 126footlong 12 millionpound 
booster at 11 am was the third in a series of five fullscale 
tests scheduled before the shuttle returns to space 
the test was designed to reveal any weaknesses in the new 
booster which was redesigned following the jan 28 1986 
explosion of the shuttle challenger that killed seven astronauts 
for the test the rocket was assembled with deliberate flaws in 
the sealing material of two joints to see if hot gases would 
penetrate them flawed seals have been tested previously in 
shortduration tests but never in a fullscale firing raab said 
a plume of bright yellow flame erupted from the rocket sending 
a cloud of grayishbrown smoke and dust billowing hundreds of feet 
in the air cattle grazing nearby bolted at the roar and hundreds 
of company workers and school children cheered and applauded 
company engineers and nasa officials planned a briefing after 
they conduct a preliminary inspection of the prone rocket a 
detailed analysis of the results was several days away 
the challenger disaster was blamed on a booster rocket joint 
improperly sealed by a rubber oring which allowed hot gases to 
escape and ignite the shuttles external fuel tank 
the redesigned joint has a third oring to protect the primary 
oring from hot gases the old joint had two rings a gap between 
sections of insulation in the old joint is now filled with putty 
engineers also have added a metal lip called the capture 
feature that rests between the insulation and the orings the lip 
is designed to prevent the joint from bulging under the pressure of 
burning gases during launch 
 
the remaining fullscale tests are scheduled for june and july 
if all goes well the shuttles first postchallenger launch is set 
for sometime in midaugust 
the test comes at a critical time for thiokol the company is 
nasas sole supplier of booster rockets and views a successful 
launch as a sign that the stigma of the challenger tragedy can be 
set aside 
while praising thiokols work in the redesign effort nasa also 
has asked congress for a 12 million government plant to build 
advanced space shuttle booster rockets the space agency wants the 
proposed plant to be accessible by rail and water which would 
exclude thiokols plant in landlocked utah

public speaking and other stressful encounters can 
be as potent as hard exercise in disrupting the hearts blood 
supply when people have underlying heart disease a study shows 
the researchers said their work gives scientific weight to the 
widely held belief that mental stress can overtax the heart and may 
trigger heart attacks 
they found that giving a public talk about ones shortcomings 
can be as disruptive to the heart as exercising to exhaustion 
however it also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiac 
problem only for people with heart disease not for those with 
healthy hearts 
the chief author of the study recommended that people suspected 
of having heart disease those who smoke or have high blood 
pressure high cholesterol or a family history of heart trouble 
should be checked 
nothing should come out of this work about what patients 
should or shouldnt be doing in their daily lives said the 
researcher dr alan rozanski i think people should exercise 
and you cant go around worrying about mental stress 
the study conducted at cedarssinai medical center in los 
angeles is the latest of several recent reports about a newly 
recognized condition called silent ischemia 
ischemia occurs when the heart muscle fails to get enough blood 
sometimes this shortage causes chest pain known as angina but 
experts have learned that more often ischemia is painless or 
silent 
if the ischemia lasts for more than 20 or 30 minutes the 
oxygenstarved section of the heart dies resulting in a heart 
attack although the crisis usually passes in a few minutes without 
permanent damage it may be a warning of more serious heart 
problems to come 
it is usually diagnosed by a stress test using an 
electrocardiogram but an attack has to come during the test for 
the condition to be detected 
in their study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine rozanski and colleagues studied 39 heart patients and 12 
healthy people while the men and women did a series of mildly 
stressful mental exercises the doctors used a common diagnostic 
procedure called nuclear cardiology to watch their beating hearts 
they found that a variety of mental gymnastics such as 
repeatedly subtracting seven from a fourdigit number could 
trigger ischemia the worst was asking people to give a fiveminute 
talk in front of two observers about their personal faults and bad 
habits 
it really brings home the notion that silent ischemia doesnt 
just occur at extreme levels of exercise or in the highest risk 
patients commented dr sidney gottlieb of johns hopkins 
university these are everyday patients who are doing quite well 
with coronary disease who with minor levels of stress are having 
significant amounts of ischemia 
rozanski noted that while the stress of hard exercise often 
caused pain mental stress rarely did 
for years and years there has been a folklore about what 
mental stress can do in people with heart disease he said but 
now for the first time we have evidence of that and an opportunity 
to study the relationship between mental stress and heart disease 
dr andrew p selwyn of brigham and womens hospital in boston 
has reached similar conclusions he equipped heart patients with 
portable electrocardiogram machines and matched their episodes of 
ischemia with what they were doing less than a quarter of them 
occurred during exercise 
in an editorial in the journal selwyn said the arteries of 
people with heart disease apparently fail to expand and contract 
properly in reaction to stress when healthy hearts need more 
blood the arteries open up to increase the flow 
however when the arteries are clogged with fatty desposits the 
opposite seems to occur they respond to physical or mental stress 
by squeezing tight 
when silent ischemia is discovered people can be treated with 
medicines coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty a common 
procedure that uses balloons to open up clogged heart arteries

every friday hundreds of refugees from 
romania converge on a suburban church seeking food work money or 
advice on how to rejoin loved ones they abandoned in a desperate 
escape for a better life 
they are among thousands who have become the first in history to 
flee one soviet bloc nation for another hungary took the 
unprecedented step in january of refusing to send these people back 
to their homeland 
most refugees are ethnic hungarians from transylvania a region 
of mountains and forests disputed for centuries between hungary and 
romania and ruled by romania since 1918 
hungarys decision to let the refugees stay has unleashed a 
charity effort unseen in soviet bloc history budapest firms have 
offered at least 7000 jobs clothing pours into churches and red 
cross offices even from abroad 
as refugees sift through old clothes and wait for work or small 
cash handouts many tell dramatic tales 
a young father who abandoned his child in romania beseeches a 
western reporter for help he spends hours he says peering across 
the border from eastern hungary and contemplating a mad dash to get 
his 18monthold baby 
a teacher sobs as she realizes that her pupils will wait in vain 
for her to return from what was supposed to be a short trip to 
hungary 
on hungarian tv a couple touch the nation with their account of 
fleeing from romania by wading through marshes under cover of 
darkness 
hungary claims that under romanian president nicolae ceausescu 
the culture of transylvanias estimated 2 million hungarians 
europes largest ethnic minority is systematically being squeezed 
out of existence 
this alleged oppression and the hardships of daytoday life in 
shortageplagued romania have pushed as many as 20000 to use short 
visits to stay in hungary 
a few hundred ethnic romanians have also made the dash through 
hungarys open door driven by what they describe as extreme 
privation 
for a family of four i got 200 grams 7 ounces of butter a 
month said cornel rosca an economist from timisoara my dream 
in romania was to eat a roast chicken which i didnt have for nine 
months 
ethnic hungarians interviewed charged they were increasingly 
discriminated against in housing jobs and education in the last 
few years 
the plight of the ethnic hungarians has touched a nerve in 
hungary which is accused by romania of whipping up sentiment over 
transylvania in order to reclaim the region 
budapest students tell of groups of women who marry ethnic 
hungarians in romania to get them out other youngsters journey to 
romania with foodstuffs for relatives or acquaintances 
a fund set up in march to aid refugees amassed 24000 in less 
than a month despite hungarys economic crisis 
for ethnic romanians it is harder to obtain the work and 
residence permits given to ethnic hungarians to settle most of 
them want to move on to the west seeing countries like visafree 
sweden as an initial goal 
even if they have tickets however like engineers maria 
chiorean and teodor petrus they find themselves stopped at the 
hungarian border 
this shows hungarys delicate position as a refuge for people 
from another warsaw pact nation as dissident critic sandor 
szilagyi puts it it is unimaginable for the comrades that there 
exist refugees from a socialist society 
his unofficial group helping refugees has urged that a united 
nations office be set up in budapest to handle the refugees 
organize emigration to the west and reunite parents with spouses 
and children still in romania 
so far hungary has rejected the idea of foreign aid and refuses 
officially even to use the word refugee to describe the new 
arrivals 
the best solution would be for them to stay at home even if 
they have temporary difficulties said interior ministry official 
laszlo albrecht 
if more refugees do come however hungarys policy may have to 
change and the popular welcome may run out 
hungary may also be forced to seek international help in 
reuniting an estimated 2000 children with parents the hungarian 
red cross says it will write to its romanian counterpart about the 
children this month 
but pastor geza nemeth a main mover behind church aid for 
refugees bluntly tells refugee parents who leave children behind 
to return to romania 
no pastor is going to help a mother who abandons her child 
he said

the road from here to california for jesse 
jackson is a rough one strewn with ballot problems unfavorable 
rules small numbers of black voters and big leads for michael 
dukakis in states from pennsylvania to ohio and beyond 
eleven primaries remain before the democratic national 
convention in atlanta and only one the district of columbia 
offers jackson a solid shot the landscape is particularly difficult now 
that dukakis has 
opened a lead in the delegate count and is even winning the 
cumulative popular vote which jackson had claimed at victory 
was the most 
important battle jackson needs at least two bigstate victories in 
the next seven weeks to have a hope of pulling back even with the 
massachusetts governor 
jackson had a chance in tuesdays new york primary where his 
base of support was large and the potential for expanding his share 
of the white vote seemed substantial but he fell short taking 
only 37 percent of the vote as dukakis won half the ballots 
the challenge between pennsylvania and california and new 
jersey is to keep asserting presidential leadership keep giving 
the nation a real live alternative jackson said wednesday i 
want to give the nation a real live option between now and june 7 
and im going to do that 
va policy that regards alcoholism as misconduct was 
challenged by eugene traynor 46 a supervisor in a photography 
laboratory in new york city and james p mckelvey 42 an 
alcoholism counselor in washington dc 
both men who began drinking when they were children received 
honorable discharges from the army in the late 1960s they said 
they have abstained from drinking alcohol since the early 1970s 
when they were hospitalized and treated for the condition 
the va authorizes payment of education benefits to veterans 
within 10 years of their discharge no benefits are paid after 10 
years unless a veteran can show he or she was unable to pursue an 
education because of a physical or mental disability which was 
not the result of such veterans own willful misconduct 
the va provides an exemption from the 10year time limit for 
alocholism only when it is a secondary sympton of other 
psychological problems 
traynor and mckelvey filed federal lawsuits claiming the 
veterans administration was discriminating illlegaly against the 
handicapped 
federal appeals courts ruled against them in separate cases 
mckelvey said the high courts decision gives a message to 
other recovering alcoholics or more importantly people that are 
out there struggling trying to get sober and dying from this 
disease i believe that the justices who ruled in favor of the 
veterans administration is giving them a license to kill more or 
less theyre saying that the veterans administration can violate 
existing federal statutes and get away with it 
a va spokesman john scholzen said the agency would have no 
comment until its attorneys have examined the ruling 
the cases attracted widespread attention with the current 
renewed debate over the nature of alcoholism 
many programs have developed in recent years that treat 
alcoholics as victims of a disease rather than as social deviants 
or criminals 
the psychiatrists catalogue of diseases called the diagnostic 
and statistical manual of mental disorders calls alcohol abuse and 
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all americans 
suffer from it at some point in their lives 
dr david goldman a researcher at the national institute on 
alcohol abuse and alcoholism said the medical community has gone 
far beyond the debate about whether alcoholism is a disease now 
he said researchers are trying to identify the specific gene that 
they believe makes a person vulnerable to alcoholism 
some critics fear the recent trend treating alcoholism as a 
disease dangerously removes individual responsibility for such 
behavior as drunken driving and spouse and child abuse 
norma phillips the national president of mothers against drunk 
driving said her organization welcomes the decision because she 
believes it will encourage judges to give tougher sentences in 
drunken driving cases 
there are some judges who feel people are not able to make a 
decision after they drink said mrs phillips of escondido 
calif they feel they have an alcohol problem so they give 
lighter sentences 
a spokesman for alcoholocs anonymous who asked not to be named 
said the question of whether or not alcohol abuse is a disease does 
not matter in aa treatment which calls for group support in 
staying sober 
weve never taken any position as to whether or not it is an 
illness because it doesnt really matter with our treatment 
system the spokesman said 
there are an estimated 10 million alcoholics in the united 
states including about one million who seek treatment annually in 
one form or another 
in other action the court 
ruled that unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to 
boycott neutral employers against whom the unions have no 
grievance 
voting 80 in a case from florida the justices said that 
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging 
in secondary boycott picketing of neutral employers it does not 
ban nonpicketing activities aimed at such businesses 
in a separate decision the court ruled by a 62 vote in a 
california case that employers may be forced to provide free 
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at 
organizing employees 
upheld a law requiring munijcipal or state bonds issued after 
june 30 1983 to be registered before they can be taxexempt 
the justices by a 71 vote ruled that the federal law enacted 
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does 
not violate any states sovereign immunity 
the alcoholism case is traynor vs turnage 86622 
the psychiatrists catalogue of diseases called the diagnostic 
and statistical manual of mental disorders calls alcohol abuse and 
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all americans 
suffer from it at some point in their lives

sen albert gore jr is ending his campaign for 
the 1988 democratic presidential nomination after a weak 
thirdplace showing in the new york primary sources said today 
the word from back home in tennessee was that gore should 
gracefully get out sources close to his campaign speaking 
only on condition of anonymity said the candidate was grappling 
with whether to hold his delegates until the convention 
gore winless since super tuesday six weeks ago scheduled an 
announcement for thursday in washington 
he told supporters in new york that he would be consulting with 
advisers over the next few days and were going to decide 
among ourselves how best we can carry on the cause that we have 
been advancing 
campaign manager fred martin said gore had not decided whether 
to drop out 
as the new york votes were tallied and the scope of gores loss 
became clear he congratulated massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
calling it somebody elses super tuesday 
i want to congratulate mike dukakis for a really impressive 
victory new york is a real marathon and he beat us by a mile he 
said 
gore talked about the prospects of democrats in the fall rather 
than his own uncertain future 
i believe that together we are going to teach the republicans 
a lesson they wont soon forget in november the tennessee 
senator told supporters gathered at a midtown hotel 
meanwhile tennessee gov ned mcwherter a key gore adviser 
said the senator was considering quitting the race 
i told him he should gracefully get out and let this one 
conclude mcwherter said from nashville tenn he said gore had 
called him from new york while awaiting primary results 
the options are to continue campaigning and affect the 
dialogue with the party to suspend the candidacy but remain a 
candidate or to withdraw martin said 
gore congratulated the secondplace finisher in new york jesse 
jackson praising his tremendous showing 
early today gore paid a courtesy call on jackson to tell 
him of his plans for the next several days said gerald austin 
jacksons national campaign manager 
gore said his wife tipper had gone on to texas for a 
fundraiser set for tonight because we need the money gore 
said he planned to meet her there 
gores campaign is reported to be 16 million in debt and he 
had needed to win 20 percent of the vote in new york to be eligible 
for federal matching funds 
martin discounted reports tuesday that gore had begun recalling 
campaign workers from pennsylvania the next primary state he 
blamed gores poor showing in new york on lack of money and name 
recognition and the perception by some that it was a twoperson 
race 
gore at 40 the youngest candidate joined the race june 29 at 
the urging of a group of wealthy democrats convinced that only a 
southerner could win in 1988 
he made some early forays into iowa but when the waters proved 
chilly he declared iowans had too much influence on the process 
and said he would risk skipping the crucial caucus state when 
polls indicated a weak showing in new hampshire he left the north 
altogether and headed to his native south to make a stand on super 
tuesday 
for one day his strategy looked brilliant he won six states on 
march 8 and jumped immediately into the front tier with dukakis and 
jackson but the gore campaign apparently had not looked beyond 
super tuesday with no one except the candidate apparently in 
charge the gore campaign lurched into illinois michigan and then 
wisconsin gathering a total of 435 convention delegates along the 
way 
of those delegates only two came from the huge new york bloc of 
255 up for grabs tuesday gore pulled only 10 percent of the vote 
here far behind dukakis 51 percent and jacksons 37 percent 
the only consistent theme of gores campaign of late had been 
attack he launched regular salvos at dukakis and jackson saying 
it was nothing personal but the voters deserved to know the 
differences among the candidates 
in new york gore opened with a strategy centered on criticism 
of the other two candidates but when supporter koch picked up the 
theme with a vengeance even gore seemed to cringe 
i never wanted to stop mike dukakis or stop jesse jackson 
gore said tuesday night i just wanted to start al gore 
gore resisted criticizing koch but made it clear the mayor 
spoke only for himself after the polls closed he thanked koch for 
his support but noted he ignored a lot of advice that he got 
from people around him

president reagans years of budget and trade 
deficits will preoccupy policy makers through the end of the 
century as they struggle to correct the shortfalls without plunging 
the nation into economic decline a congressional committee said 
wednesday 
this is a legacy of sharp imbalances imbalances which cannot 
be sustained sen paul sarbanes dmd chairman of the joint 
economic committee said wednesday in releasing the panels annual 
report they represent growing claims against our future 
the democraticcontrolled panels study which republican 
committee members labeled as politically tainted called the reagan 
deficits the legacy of experiment in supplyside economics 
the process of correction will define the course of the 
nations economic policy for the remainder of the century it 
said 
last falls federal deficitreduction agreement between 
president reagan and congressional leaders was only a first 
step toward controlling the record red ink in the federal budget 
the treasurys debt less than 1 billion when reagan was elected 
will be nearly tripled by the end of his term 
meanwhile the stunning deterioration of the us trade 
position from the worlds largest creditor to its largest debtor 
nation means the nation will more than ever have to consider 
other nations interests in making its own economic decisions the 
report said 
previous forecasts of a significant drop in our net imports 
have not been borne out however as the competitive effects of the 
declining value of the dollar have been slow to be realized it 
said correction of the trade deficit is a longterm problem it 
said 
the report hesitated to predict when a recession will occur and 
noted that despite last years stock market collapse consumer 
spending has remained strong 
should a recession occur the federal budget situation would 
deteriorate rapidly risking a serious disruption in financial 
markets it said 
the reports recommendations include constant attention to the 
domestic and foreign trade deficits along with increased investment 
in education and job training 
perhaps most important we face a serious deficit in our stock 
of human capital following years of neglect of education and 
skilltraining for the american work force it said 
the committee report echoed many of the economic themes 
democratic candidates have been emphasizing this year 
republicans on the committee released a dissenting version of 
their own emphasizing the length of the current economic expansion 
and disputing democratic claims that the wealthy have done better 
than the poor and middle class under reagan 
the democratic report is not close to what we republicans 
think is the state of the economy said rep chalmers wylie of 
ohio the senior republican on the committee the reagan years 
have been good for the american people 
i dont think this is a picture of gloom and doom said sen 
bill roth rdel who cosponsored the 1981 tax cuts nothing 
can be further from the truth 
never has the foundation of our economy been stronger the 
gop report said 
rep alex mcmillan rnc disputed the democratic picture but 
also said the burdens of the budget and trade deficits could not be 
ignored 
what we need is less of a political document and more of a 
straightforward appraisal of where we go from here he said

conservationst john muir once ridiculed as 
loving trees more than people was praised on the 150th anniversary 
of his birth for the foresight that saved such natural treasures as 
yosemite and sequoia national parks 
muir who founded the sierra club died in 1914 but the 
wilderness areas he helped preserve are a living legacy for 
generations of americans said his successors in the environmental 
movement 
on thursday observances are planned at muirs home in martinez 
at his parents homestead in wisconsin and in dunbar scotland 
where muir was born april 21 1838 
over the past 20 years hes reemerged as the patron saint of 
the sierra club said mike mccloskey chairman of the 
environmental group muir organized in 1892 he never fell into 
obscurity but hes being held now in the highest esteem that he 
has been since his death 
mccloskey and others said muirs legacy was twofold as a 
conservationist he believed in preserving wilderness for its own 
sake but the scrappy outdoorsman also realized it was necessary to 
create a political constituency to protect wild places 
i think he had an enormous effect on what happened in this 
country in conservation said former sierra club president david 
brower 75 who has gained notoriety in his own right as a high 
priest of the environmental movement 
muirs sesquicentennial comes as interior secretary donald hodel 
considers the feasibility of tearing down the dam that broke muirs 
heart 
muir died barely a year after president woodrow wilson signed 
legislation to build a dam in yosemite national park which flooded 
muirs beloved hetch hetchy valley the project formed a reservoir 
that remains san franciscos primary source of water 
muir argued that the area was a second yosemite valley in 
terms of quality and deserved to be protected and indeed it was 
supposed to be part of the national park mccloskey said its 
a great blot upon the record of national parks in the united 
states 
by most accounts muir was an odd and eccentric character at 
times as prickly as a thistle transplanted from his native scotland 
his right eye was permanently skewed the result of an 
industrial accident that nearly blinded him when he was 28 his 
beard often grew so long and unruly that it swept his chest like a 
broom in photographs his hair appears untamable 
as a student at the university of wisconsin in 1861 muir was 
invited to a reception where he was so awestruck by a piano that 
he actually climbed inside the instrument to examine its workings 
still his genius was evident in his tremendous energy first as 
an inventor then later as a mountaineer essayist and 
conservationist 
and though he traveled throughout the united states and alaska 
yosemite was the area that came to possess him said ed 
wayburn a san francisco physician who has been on the sierra 
clubs board of directors since 1957 
he first arrived in san francisco in 1868 and by his own 
account went straight to the yosemite valley he determined that 
glaciers had carved the breathtaking valley a contrary notion at 
the time and his first magazine articles published in 1874 brought 
him almost instant fame 
in the ensuing decades muir gained stature as a strident but 
eminent spokesman for nature and an implacable opponent of 
destructive mining logging and development

new data from intravenous drug users in 
bangkok thailand may be evidence that aids is smoldering in 
asia an official of the agency for international development told 
congress wednesday 
dr jeffrey harris the agencys aids coordinator said a report 
on bangkok addicts came earlier this week from the world health 
organization it put their infection rate at 16 percent in the 
first three months of this year up from only 1 percent among the 
same group last year 
theres a fire raging in the caribbean harris said its 
smoldering in latin america and it may be beginning to smolder in 
asia 
he said the worst reported infection rates in the caribbean are 
in haiti the dominican republic and trinidad and tobago 
bradshaw langmaid chairman of the agencys working group on 
aids said people used to wonder if asians were to some degree 
immune from the disease both langmaid and harris warned against 
drawing firm conclusions from the limited data available 
they testified before the foreign operations subcommittee of the 
house appropriations committee 
langmaid told a reporter after the hearing that there is great 
danger of aids spreading in thailand through prostitutes who are 
often the sexual partners of addicts thailand is a favorite 
vacation spot for many people in asia 
he cited one group of prostitutes that has been studied in 
nairobi kenya their rate of infection with the aids virus was 4 
percent in 1981 65 percent in 1985 and 95 percent in 1987 
langmaid said the spread of aids in asia may be at an earlier 
stage there is evidence the disease existed in zaire as far back 
as 1976 but testing in thailand only began about three years ago 
in a statement submitted to the subcommittee langmaid said 
in general asian governments view aids as a less urgent problem 
and have moved more slowly to undertake aids prevention and control 
efforts 
the government of the philiippines is a notable exception 
having sought our support in mounting an extensive education 
campaigm he said 
the agency got 30 million for aids control in the third world 
for the year that will end sept 30 and has asked congress for the 
same amount in the following year langmaid said additional amounts 
will be spent for antiaids programs by other related programs of 
the agency including its fund for african development 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv aids is spread most 
often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug 
abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women 
to their offspring

the army does not have the required systems in 
place to adequately control governmentfurnished parts and supplies 
provided to military contractors according to a congressional 
study released wednesday 
the general accounting office report released by sen john 
glenn dohio also said army contractors are being permitted to 
requisition material from pentagon supplies without being 
identified as contractors as required by regulations 
glenn said the defense department estimated that army 
contractors held about 28 billion in governmentfurnished 
material as of the end of fiscal 1987 
we have created a large potential problem by giving 
contractors ready access to billions of dollars worth of 
government property said glenn fiscal restraint should not be 
awol at the army 
governmentfurnished material or gfm includes parts 
assemblies and other materials used in the production of tanks 
aircraft and ships 
the pentagon provides the material to contractors when it is 
determined to be in the governments best interest and the army 
allows contractors to obtain the material through direct access to 
the defense supply system 
the army does not have in place the management control and 
reporting systems that dod requires to adequately control gfm 
provided to contractors the gao concluded 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said the army expects 
to have a new managementcontrol system in place by june 1989

the furor over 980310 donated to help 
a 7yearold boy get a liver transplant prompted a senate committee 
wednesday to approve a bill to establish stricter regulations of 
charitable contributions 
ronnie desillers of miami died last april while awaiting his 
fourth liver transplant at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
earlier this year that state filed an administrative complaint 
against his mother accusing her of violating the states charity 
law by using some of the funds for personal expenses including 
rent and a car telephone 
she was fined 1000 but may contest that at a may 10 hearing 
said david adams spokesman for the department of state 
current state law says a charitable account opened for a 
beneficiary should be used only for that person 
maria desillers has denied wrongdoing saying she doubted the 
accuracy of a state audit that showed she had received 980310 in 
donations for her sons liver transplant and related medical 
expenses the donations included 1000 from president reagan and 
32000 from sailors aboard the uss john f kennedy 
the bill approved unanimously by the senate appropriations 
committee would apply to people who collect 10000 or more in 
donations it specifies that no more than 20 percent of the 
donations can be used for administrative costs and living expenses 
and says unused portions should be returned to donors on a pro rata 
basis 
a firsttime violation would be punishable by 60 days in jail a 
500 fine or both subsequent violations are punishable by a year 
in jail a 1000 fine or both 
the legislation now goes to full senate

distributed to nearly 1000 hungry migrant workers who have arrived 
at farmlabor camps well ahead of the summer harvest season 
the food distributed tuesday was part of the five tons of 
staples donated by retailer fred meyer inc at the salvation armys 
request to feed the 3000 to 5000 people who have come early to 
rural washington county west of portland 
ten tons of potatoes were donated by troutdale farmer howard 
winters who has promised 200 tons more and 22 tons of dried beans 
were donated by the salvation army 
maj mervyn l morelock of the salvation armys cascade division

democratic leaders across the country embraced 
michael dukakis as their partys presidential frontrunner on 
wednesday although most remained reluctant to anoint him as the 
nominee 
the fat lady isnt singing yet but she may be warming up 
south carolina state chairman chris verenes said in a reference to 
the saying that the opera isnt over until the fat lady sings 
i think it surely puts him in the drivers seat said 
maryland party official john willis 
the massachusetts governors clearcut win over jesse jackson 
and sen albert gore jr in new york gave him a substantial lead in 
nominating delegates and put a lid at least temporarily on 
speculation of a deadlocked convention in atlanta in july 
it wont be a brokered convention itll be a firstballot 
victory for dukakis said fred brown a democratic national 
committee member from oklahoma 
connecticut democratic chairman john f droney jr said he 
expects a twoman race through the california primary and then i 
expect that governor dukakis will be nominated on the first ballot 
at the convention 
the new york thing almost locks it up for dukakis or comes 
close to it 1984 unsuccessful candidate sen john glenn of ohio 
said 
i think its going to be much smoother sailing now georgia 
party chairman john henry anderson said 
dukakis himself refused to claim the mantle of likely nominee 
saying nothing in this world is inevitable and weve got much to 
do he was also wise to the rollercoaster ways of democratic 
presidential politics several frontrunners have come and gone in 
1988 
anything can go bump in the night in democratic politics 
illinois state chairman vince demuzio said you have some large 
key states that are left and we probably wont have it locked up 
before the convention but who knows 
lynn cutler democratic national committee vice chair and an 
uncommitted delegate from iowa said dukakis strong new york 
victory solidifies his position but she noted there is a 
tendency in the democratic party to slap the frontrunner on the 
wrist 
he looks good but its not a done deal yet she said 
new york gov mario cuomo was annoyed at reporters who asked 
wednesday whether dukakis nomination was inevitable 
of course its not inevitable he said at a news conference 
in albany 
what would derail it 
defeat abdication surrender change of mind the cuomo 
said 
most democratic party leaders and elected officials noted 
jacksons impressive showings so far in 1988 but said it was 
difficult to predict his role at the convention on the ticket or 
in a democratic administration 
even if he isnt on the ticket he has such a tremendous 
following that hes going to carry a big stick at the convention 
said jim parrish kansas state party chairman 
i cant see him in the second spot he wouldnt take it and i 
dont think it would be offered democratic national committee 
member william davis of indiana said instead davis speculated 
that jackson would wind up being secretary of something

presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater didnt 
immediately react wednesday to pending elections in denmark but he 
did serve up a tongueincheek mealtime quip 
when asked if the administration had any comment on new 
elections being called because of a ban on visits by nucleararmed 
warships he replied danish means breakfast to me 
when reporters assembled in the white house briefing room broke 
up in laughter the spokesman repeated the line 
then fitzwater his face reddening said my heart is pure on 
that one folks give me a break he promised well check it 
out for you

sen albert gore jr his super tuesday strategy 
a failure outside the south was packing away his presidential 
ambitions wednesday after his dismal finish in the new york 
democratic primary 
his campaign more than 15 million in debt gore flew to texas 
for a 1000perperson fundraiser he scheduled a washington news 
conference for thursday which has been dropout day throughout 
this presidential campaign 
a campaign source said the tennessee senator would announce he 
was halting his effort 
arriving in austin gore told reporters im in the midst now 
of consulting with friends and supporters all over the country and 
asking for their advice on how we can best continue the cause for 
which i have been fighting 
gores departure from the race would narrow the field to michael 
dukakis firmly established after his new york victory as the 
frontrunner and jesse jackson 
on paper gores strategy for winning the nomination made some 
sense but once the campaign got under way he always seemed to be 
the candidate pursuing the wrong agenda in the wrong place at the 
wrong time 
its very difficult if not impossible to develop democratic 
party support as one who plays the conservative side of the 
fence said peter d kelly chairman of the california democratic 
party there are just not enough votes out there 
kelly was citing a reality of democratic party nomination 
politics that southerners who once dominated the party now blame 
for recent general election disasters landslide losses in three 
of the last four presidential contests 
ironically it was jackson the most liberal candidate in the 
race but also a southerner who stood in the way of gores plan to 
capture the nomination by running as the conservative 
from the start gore was the stranger at the democrats 
presidential party arriving unfashionably late and standing alone 
to the right of the other guests 
gore wanted to be the super tuesday candidate for the democratic 
presidential nomination but he never succeeded in attracting a 
following outside his native south and the vote he received in the 
south on that tuesday march 8 was not big enough to overcome his 
alsoran showings earlier in iowa and new hampshire 
in hindsight gores decision to pass up iowa as too liberal and 
to make far less effort in new hampshire than his rivals looks like 
an insurmountable mistake 
but at the time many southerners thought super tuesday was 
going to sharply diminish the influence of the two northern states 
that have dominated nomination politics in both parties for 20 
years 
i always felt like if anybody could pass up iowa and new 
hampshire he could said kathy vick louisiana democratic party 
chairman that he was an exception to the unwritten rule that you 
had to play in iowa and new hampshire 
gore finished last in iowa and fifth in a sevencandidate field 
in new hampshire 
march 8 the day nearly every southern and border state held 
primaries was the key to the gore strategy but that plan ran into 
the formidable presence of jackson as well as dukakis ability to 
run well in florida and texas 
gore came out of super tuesday looking good but not good 
enough in many states in the region he and jackson ran onetwo 
the senator winning some the former civil rights activist winning 
others either man would have done much better on super tuesday had 
the other not been in the contest 
even though super tuesday established gore as one of the three 
leading contenders for the nomination he never carried another 
congressional district in subsequent primaries 
and he ended up making his last desperate try for credibility 
in a city and state that symbolized social and political views 
light years away from the south his chief ally that 
quintessential abrasive new yorker mayor edward koch 
koch often overshadowed the candidate he endorsed the mayor 
kept up a drumfire of attacks on jackson at one point saying jews 
and other supporters of israel would have to be crazy to vote 
for him 
on election night the mayor conceded he may not have helped 
gore he said i think the exit polls show that 2 to 1 people 
did not like my criticisms of jackson

the family of an american engineer slain by the 
contras in nicaragua filed a 50 million wrongful death suit 
wednesday against rebel leaders and accused the reagan 
administration of covering up the incident 
benjamin linder 27 of portland ore was shot to death april 
28 1987 when contra troops attacked the small hydroelectric 
project he was helping to build in northern nicaragua 
they wounded ben and then shot him through the head at 
pointblank range said linders mother elisabeth linder this 
is an act of murder and those responsible should pay for their 
crimes 
the autopsy showed linder had up to 40 needle puncture marks on 
his face suggesting he may have been tortured before his death 
the family said 
asked if the object of the federal suit was to close down the 
contras mrs linder answered damn right 
named as defendants in the suit are nicaraguan resistance 
directors adolfo calero and aristides sanchez along with military 
leaders enrique bermudez and indalecio rodriguez the resistance 
itself is also being sued the suit was referred to us district 
judge stanley marcus but no hearing has been set 
contra spokesman jorge rosales said wednesday that his group had 
no comment on the suit 
the linders attorney michael ratner of the new yorkbased 
center for consititutional rights said the reagan administration 
which strongly supports the contras in their effort to oust the 
leftist nicaraguan government had tried to thwart the familys 
investigation 
the us role is we believe very strong in the coverup 
said ratner he said the us government could be added to the suit 
filed in miami because the contras have their headquarters here 
or could be sued separately at a later time 
the state department coached the contra unit responsible for the 
attack on how to answer questions from people investigating the 
killing and us officials destroyed notes and sketches made 
during their own interviews with the rebels the attorney said 
department spokesman bud jacobs did not immediately return a 
telephone call wednesday seeking comment 
the contras have previously acknowledged linders death but 
said only that he was armed and died in a firefight between contras 
and sandinista troops the new york times last year reported that 
contra leaders said privately that linder had been mistaken for a 
cuban adviser but the linder family said his sons presence in the 
area was wellknown 
the linders agreed their son was armed at the time of the 
attack saying that he carried a weapon because of contra death 
threats against coworkers 
at the news conference ratner also displayed a june 1987 state 
department memo showing that a departmenthired consultant dr sam 
zweifel agreed with the familys autopsy report showing linder was 
shot at close range rather than in a gunbattle 
i would like to know more about the complicity of the reagan 
administration said linders father dr david linder i dont 
see why they are so secretive if they have nothing to hide 
he said whether or not us government officials knew in advance 
of the attack he held them responsible because they funded and 
directed the contras 
bens death was no accident said his father he and his 
coworkers were targeted by the contras because they were bringing 
electricity to poor nicaraguans 
mrs linder said trial testimony would show the cia helped the 
contras chose what places to attack the attack on the cuabocay 
hydroeletric plant was part of a concerted effort by the contras to 
stop rural development projects they said

president reagan intervened wednesday to avert 
a threatened strike against the chicago and north western 
transportation co by creating an emergency board to investigate 
the railroads contract dispute with the united transportation 
union 
in addition to being a major freight hauler of the chicago and 
north western provides the principal rail service for suburbanites 
commuting to work in chicago 
under the railway labor act the board will report to the 
president in 30 days with its recommendations for settlement the 
parties are then required to try to resolve their differences 
without a strike during the succeeding 30 days 
cnw officials maintain they could realize annual savings of more 
than 50 million by cutting the two brakemen from current four or 
fiveman crews which also include engineers and conductors the 
union has threatened to strike friday over the issue 
the white house said the national mediation board found that the 
threatened strike threatens to deprive several midwestern states of 
essential transportation services 
the railroad employs more than 8000 people and is the eighth 
largest rail carrier in the united states as measured by revenue 
generated it handled nearly 15 million carloads and more than 80 
million tons of traffic in 1986 
in addition to its freighthandling activities the railroad 
is the major rail passenger provider for the city of chicago 
handling approximately 40000 passengers daily the white house 
announcement said 
alternatives to this commuter rail service are limited as a 
result the chicago area would suffer a substantial disruption of 
normal business activities in the event of a strike

rural high school science students who 
sent mississippi bugs to the soviet union are anxiously awaiting a 
return shipment of insects from the moscow zoo 
science teacher doug fleury said the work started after students 
wanted to recognize soviet scientific achievements and he began 
corresponding with the soviets for them samples of unicorn 
beetles about the size of hen eggs and velvet ants a type of 
wingless wasp were sent to moscow in 1985 
now two kinds of giant walking sticks and a giant roach are en 
route to this rural area of northeast mississippi 
fleury is pleased 
its just not done a country school swapping bugs with a 
major international zoo he said recently 
on may 2 and 3 jumpertown high pupils with former pupils at 
thrasher high school where the work began will celebrate the 
project 
brad fugitt 18 of booneville who graduated from thrasher last 
year said he had been collecting insects for fleury for five years 
and some of his insects have been sent as far as moscow 
it kind of feels like an honor he said 
fugitt is waiting for a response to a letter he wrote recently 
to the moscow zoo to invite russian scientists to participate in an 
insectcollecting expedition in mississippi in june or july 
fleury said he has two hopes for the bug exchanges to send some 
of the pupils to the soviet union with a shipment of live insects 
and to bring someone from moscow to northeast mississippi 
its not unusual for zoo people to have a bigger view of the 
world than just geographical boundaries fleury said the 
scientific discipline doesnt have geographical boundaries it has 
biological boundaries

a 275foot river will be listed in the 
1989 edition of the guinness book of world records as the worlds 
shortest river thanks to the efforts of fifthgraders at lincoln 
elementary school 
teacher susie nardinger and her students received a letter 
recently from guinness officials saying their documentation had 
been accepted for the roe river northeast of great falls 
the short stretch of water flows past a fish hatchery and is 
named for fish eggs 
the roe will replace in guinness the 440footlong d river at 
lincoln city ore 
students launched their efforts in october and the class 
learned how complicated a project can become during the ensuing six 
months nardinger said 
they learned that they had to work through channels she 
said 
before guinness editors would even consider listing it the roe 
had to be an official river in the eyes of us government 
officials 
much of the time was spent trying to gain an official blessing 
for the river from the domestic names committee of the us board 
on geographic names the committee approved the name of roe river

shepherds candidacy for deputy attorney general made up nearly 
every portion of her background the st louis postdispatch

college having terminal cancer and performing well in past jobs 
but people interviewed by the newspaper including sinners former 
husband said she had lied 
sinner was convicted in march of stealing nearly 147000 from 
shepherds st louis law firm while she worked there as a 
bookkeeper sinner claimed she had had an affair with shepherd 
that he was responsible for having hired her and that he had told 
her to write checks on the firms account for her personal use

were lies

and her lawyer never presented one shred of evidence to support 
her claims

general edwin meeses choice to fill the no 2 spot in the justice

a wisconsin lawyer trying to convince the 
supreme court that communities violate freespeech rights when they 
ban picketing at private homes ran into a buzzsaw of hostile 
comments wednesday 
we dont claim a right to harass steven f mcdowell of 
milwaukee said in behalf of two antiabortion activists who want to 
picket a doctors home but several justices seemed dubious 
you want to hassle this doctor justice antonin scalia said 
you want to stick your thumb in his eye isnt that what this is 
all about 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice thurgood marshall 
repeatedly asked mcdowell why his clients freedom of speech could 
not be served by picketing dr benjamin victorias places of 
business rather than his home 
at one point rehnquist suggested that a ban on residential 
picketing could become more acceptable if there exists an 
opportunity to bring the message home someplace else such as 
victorias offices 
and justice anthony m kennedy pressed questions about a right 
to a quiet street 
antiabortion activists in the spring of 1985 demonstrated in 
front of victorias home in brookfield wis denouncing him as an 
abortionist and a baby killer 
victoria practices medicine at offices in milwaukee and 
appleton wis 
the demonstrators picketed victorias home on at least six 
different occasions with the groups ranging in size from 11 to 
more than 40 people 
during the month the picketing occurred the brookfield town 
board enacted an ordinance outlawing picketing before or about 
the residence or dwelling of any individual 
harold h fuhrman of milwaukee the towns lawyer told the 
justices wednesday the town council was appalled at this invasion 
of privacy 
he said the ordinance was aimed only at pickets who concentrated 
on one particular home and not those who chose to parade through a 
neighborhood with their messages 
fuhrman also said the ordinance allowed picketing in the towns 
two commercial areas 
the antiabortion groups stopped the picketing but two of the 
demonstrators sandra c schultz and robert l braun challenged 
the ordinance in court 
a federal trial judge barred brookfield from enforcing the 
ordinance and an evenly divided 7th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the judges ruling 
the justices decision is expected by july 
the case is frisby vs schultz 87168

the white house prodded the senate on 
wednesday to approve a nucleararms treaty with the soviet union 
saying it would be most unfortunate if the agreement is not 
ratified by the time president reagan goes to moscow for summit 
talks in late may 
the treaty banning all us and soviet intermediaterange 
missiles is not expected to come to the senate floor until may 9 
at the earliest leaving only 2 weeks for debate before reagan 
leaves for moscow 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said were very 
concerned the treaty might not be approved in time i think it 
would be most unfortunate if that happened he said 
fitzwater said ratification of the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces or inf treaty would have an effect on negotiations to curb 
the deadliest class of nuclear weapons strategic arms 
to have the inf treaty signed before the summit would be an 
important boost to our negotiations on strategic weapons the 
spokesman said 
similarly if its not signed it would tend to dampen i 
think the prospects for serious progress on a strategic 
weapons treaty he added it would not be helpful and we would 
hope that the congress would be able to ratify it before we go 
even if the inf treaty is ratified administration officials 
doubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing at 
the summit 
after a threenight rest stop in helsinki finland reagan will 
arrive in moscow on may 29 for his fourth meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the two leaders will see each on each of the five days reagan is 
in moscow the president also will have separate schedule of his 
own 
for example he will hold a meeting with soviet writers artists 
and film makers visit a monastery and also confer with soviet 
refuseniks jews denied permission to emigrate 
white house planners expect that a highlight will be a 
presidential address to soviet students followed by a 
questionandanswer session with the audience the event is 
expected to be broadcast on live television in the united states 
reagan also plans to end the visit with a news conference 
the inf ratification is important for what it says about the 
united states commitment to arms control and therefore helping 
make progress in the start strategic arms reduction talks 
fitzwater said 
all of our discussions with the congress had indicated that 
they would be able to ratify the treaty before we go to moscow 
fitzwater said that has been our expectation we still think 
that is possible and we hope that the congress will stick to that 
schedule 
the latest snag in the ratification process is the question of 
whether the treaty bans futuristic weapons such as lasers particle 
beams and other devices as well as existing weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a letter to 
secretary of state george p shultz said the soviets agree with 
the united states that the treaty bans futuristic weapons 
the treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to 
3400 miles but some senators have questioned how the pact would 
affect weapons in that range that could be developed in the future 
once the treaty is on the senate floor the agreement likely 
will encounter stalling tactics from sen jesse helms rnc and 
other foes

donald d engen the former federal aviation 
administration chief accused the department of transportation on 
wednesday of having a plodding rulemaking process that he likened 
to a maddening shell and pea game 
engen told the senate commerce aviation subcommittee that while 
he headed faa the transportation department sometimes added months 
to the time his agency needed to implement new air safety 
regulations the faa is a branch of the department 
there were times as administrator that i viewed this as a 
maddening shell and pea game effort on the part of some on the 
transportation secretarys staff engen said in written testimony 
this seemed particularly true where the secretarys office 
viewed a rule as contentious or politically unpalatable despite its 
validity from an aviation technical viewpoint 
transportation department officials rejected engens 
contentions and distributed documents that they said challenged 
some of the claims he made 
engen left his job july 2 saying he had resigned for personal 
reasons he has declined to discuss his departure further 
asked wednesday whether the complaints he aired to the 
subcommittee had prompted his departure engen said youll have 
to draw that conclusion not me 
the former administrator has been critical before of the time 
the transportation department takes to approve faa proposals 
but engens comments this time were in greater detail and 
followed by a month a scathing critique of faa that transportation 
secretary james h burnley iv delivered to the same subcommittee 
on march 23 burnley said that faa is often reluctant to write 
regulations that would impose additional costs on the nations 
aviation industry he said that to spur the faa to take safety 
actions it has been necessary to use the bureaucratic equivalent 
of a cattle prod 
engen cited one instance in which he said he blocked the boeing 
co from removing two of the 10 emergency exits on its 747 
jetliners to add extra seats the former administrator said he 
rejected the manufacturers request because it would have been less 
safe for passengers he also said that the transportation 
department was strangely silent while the matter was decided 
there was no waffling no coziness between government and 
industry he said 
but transportation department spokesman bob marx gave a reporter 
a copy of an aug 6 1985 letter from thentransportation 
secretary elizabeth h dole to rep major owens dny stating 
that at my request engen was pursuing the issue 
a june 10 1985 letter to mrs dole from henry a duffy 
president of the air line pilots association expressed our 
disappointment and concern regarding admiral engens endorsement of 
the overwing emergency exit deactivation on boeing 747 aircraft 
the letter asked mrs dole to block faa approval of the plan 
in another instance engen said boeing offered in the spring of 
1985 to develop a device for training pilots to deal with wind 
shear sudden powerful gusts that imperil takeoffs and landings 
he said he pressed the transportation department to quickly 
accept boeings 13 million offer arguing that the issue needed 
to be addressed as soon as possible using the usual bidding 
process he said could consume many months if not years 
he said that transportation department officials questioned the 
contract and the proposal was bounced between the department and 
the faa like a ping pong ball it was not approved until 
october two months after a delta airlines jet crashed at 
dallasfort worth international airport because of wind shear 
but after engen spoke wednesday the transportation department 
distributed an aug 20 1985 letter to engen from burnley who was 
deputy transportation secretary at the time in the memo burnley 
objected to the proposed 21 million contract arguing that it 
contained excessive profit for boeing 
in a letter from engen to mrs dole dated sept 24 1985 engen

secretary of state george p shultz 
said wednesday that it was wrong to allow the hijackers of a 
kuwaiti jetliner to get away 
the algerian government negotiated the release wednesday of 31 
hostages ending the 16day ordeal in which two kuwaiti passengers 
were slain the whereabouts of the gunmen was not known 
they are not only hijackers but murderers shultz told a 
news conference during a stopover on a trip to moscow for 
presummit talks 
asked if the hijackers should have been allowed to go free 
shultz said no i dont think thats a proper thing to do 
kuwait thanked algeria for mediating in the past the united 
states also expressed gratitude to governments that assisted in 
ending hostagetakings but shultz pointedly did not 
and yet shultz indicated the united states might not have legal 
rights to pursue the hijackers who demanded the release of 17 
prisoners held in kuwait in an assault on the us and french 
embassies in the persian gulf country 
only one of the passengers might have held us citizenship 
which would give the justice department a possible course of 
action but shultz said he did not know if the passengers dual 
nationality had been pinned down 
extradition also might be possible if reports are confirmed that 
one of the gunmen was involved in the hijacking of a twa jetliner 
in 1985 in which one of the passengers a us navy diver was 
killed 
dont misunderstand me shultz said im not 
secondguessing the algerian government what im saying is these 
people were hijackers and clearly murderers from the 
standpoint of the international community we dont like to see 
hijackers go off free 
shultz stopped in helsinki on his way to moscow to resume 
preparations for the may 29june 2 summit meeting in the soviet 
capital where he is to hold talks with mikhail s gorbachev and 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
on shultzs agenda are the iraniraq war which threatens 
shipping in the persian gulf and ussoviet negotiations to 
conclude a treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons arsenals as much 
as 50 percent 
shultz said he will again appeal to the soviets to help get the 
united nations security council to impose an arms embargo against 
iran 
on arms control shultz said well keep working for a good 
agreement but he said it would be hard to accomplish in time for 
a summit signing by gorbachev and president reagan 
us and soviet drafts of the accord have 1200 distinct points 
of disagreement with the summit meeting only five weeks away about 
half are technical but the others touch on the difficult problem 
of verifying weapons reductions are carried out

the state medical examiner has been sued 
for 2 million for ordering an autopsy over the religious 
objections of a hmong couple whose son died of sudden unexplained 
death syndrome in december 
you vang yang and his wife ia kue yang believe the suit filed 
tuesday will stop a string of yang deaths that started after an 
autopsy was performed on their nephew following a car accident in 
1984 
the suit filed by the state affiliate of the american civil 
liberties union alleges the autopsy on neng yang infringed on 
yangs constitutional right to practice religion 
the autopsy on yang 23 was conducted against the wishes of his 
family at the order of dr william q sturner who is being sued 
for 1 million in compensation and 1 million in punitive damages 
in addition to the constitutional issue the suit contends the 
autopsy did not meet any of the six categories of circumstances set 
out by state law under which autopsies may be performed 
of paramount concern to the yangs however is the religious 
implication 
they believe in animism a reincarnation faith in which the soul 
of a person after death is reborn as another person but the spirit 
stays with the body 
they believe the soul from a mutilated body cannot pass into the 
next place until it enters an intact body both souls can then 
move on to the next life according to amato deluca the aclu 
attorney handling the case 
during a news conference the dead mans parents and three 
uncles blamed the sudden unexplained deaths of neng yang and two 
other young males in the family on an autopsy on a nephew who died 
in a car accident four years ago 
each of the deaths occurred in december and family members fear 
yangs soul will come to claim another member of the family this 
year 
theyre absolutely terrified over whats happened here 
deluca said 
according to fu yang another uncle of the victim the lawsuit 
shifts responsibility for the mutilation to the medical examiner 
who will then presumably be the target of neng yangs soul when it 
returns this december 
sturner is out of town this week and was unavailable for 
comment his secretary said he has said the mysterious 
circumstances of yangs death warranted an autopsy 
according to the suit between the time of neng yangs first 
seizures dec 21 and his death three days later the family 
repeatedly told the attending doctor they did not want an autopsy 
if yang died 
the suit said the doctor assured them their wishes would be 
honored but if not they would be contacted 
they were never notified the suit contends and found out about 
the autopsy only when they went to the funeral home to dress the 
body 
according to dr gib parrish a medical epidemiologist and 
pathologist at the centers for disease control in atlanta 115 
southeast asians died from suds through september 1987 the latest 
figures available 
the syndrome primarily strikes young males and the hmong from 
mountainous areas of laos are particularly hard hit although 
parrish said other laotian groups as well as cambodians are highly 
susceptible 
us suds deaths were highest in 1981 which also coincided with 
the peak of southeast asian immigration one theory ties the 
syndrome to stress related to immigration and culture shock 
other possible explanations are poverty and possible heart 
abnormalities among southeast asians or genetic predisposition 
parrish said

a parliamentary commission wednesday approved the 
ussoviet treaty banning intermediaterange missiles setting the 
stage for soviet ratification before the moscow summit 
commission chairman giorgy m kornienko also told a news 
conference that it would be difficult but still possible to 
conclude a treaty cutting strategic nuclear weapons by the time of 
president reagans may 29june 2 visit 
but he said progress on strategic weapons depends on what 
secretary of state george p shultz says when he arrives in moscow 
on thursday 
kornienko said that at a meeting wednesday a special commission 
set up by the foreign relations commissions of the two houses of 
the soviet parliament came to a positive conclusion on the issue 
of ratifying the treaty 
the matter will be returned to the foreign affairs commissions 
of the soviet of the union and the soviet of nationalities and then 
to the collective presidency the presidium of the supreme soviet 
the commissions will consider the recommendation at the regular 
spring meeting of the supreme soviet in may kornienko said the 
presidium may then ratify the treaty 
western diplomats who follow the soviet lawmaking process say 
the full 1500member supreme soviet can be expected to endorse the 
presidiums decision at the spring meeting 
the soviet government is going through a detailed ratification 
process but final approval is a formality because the treaty 
signed by reagan and mikhail s gorbachev on dec 8 already has 
been approved by the communist party the countrys dominant force 
in washington the white house prodded the senate to ratify the 
treaty and said it would be most unfortunate if the agreement 
is not ratified by the time reagan goes to moscow 
the treaty banning all us and soviet nuclear missiles with 
ranges between 300 and 3400 miles is not expected to come to the 
senate floor until may 9 at the earliest 
kornienkos commission began its hearings in february and held 
several sessions to which foreign correspondents were invited 
kornienko said it considered the concerns of soviet citizens 
expressed in letters to the commission and to the official press 
whether the treaty damages soviet security and came to the 
conclusion that it does not 
the security and defense capabilities of the soviet union and 
its allies will be on the same level and soviet people should not 
be concerned about that he said 
the commission also concluded that the treaty would not cause 
wide unemployment or other social or economic problems destruction 
of the missiles according to terms of the treaty will not cause 
ecological damage he said 
the commission expressed concern about the calls in the north 
atlantic treaty organization for compensation for the us pershing 
2 and cruise missiles that are being eliminated under the treaty 
kornienko said 
shultzs visit to moscow is one of a series he and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shervardnadze are conducting before the 
fourth meeting between reagan and gorbachev 
the two sides are trying to work out the details of an agreement 
to cut their arsenals of longrange nuclear missiles by 50 percent 
kornienko said reagan and gorbachev reached a basis for an 
agreement during their december summit in washington but that soon 
afterward at the geneva negotiations we faced the unpreparedness 
of the american side to go ahead at the pace necessary for signing 
at the moscow meeting 
he said an accord depends on agreement on the us program for a 
spacebased shield against nuclear attack and adherence to the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty the soviets say the missile program 
popularly known as star wars is a violation of the abm treaty 
officials said this week that us and soviet negotiators 
identified about 1200 disputed items in the strategic weapons 
treaty about half of them technical problems that could be 
resolved if major verification problems are worked out 
negotiators say that among the other problems to be worked out 
are the detection and counting of mobile and cruise missiles 
carried on planes and warships 
kornienko said another meeting between shultz and shevardnadze 
could be held before reagans visit to moscow

rock star mick jagger said wednesday 
that his credibility is at stake in a lawsuit charging that he 
stole another composers music and used it in his 1985 hit just 
another night 
reggae musician patrick alley 36 of the bronx claims the 
chorus of his 1979 song also called just another night 
appears in only a slightly modified version in jaggers song which 
was copyrighted in 1985 and appeared on jaggers solo album shes 
the boss 
jagger who is expected to testify later this week in the 
copyright infringement trial made his first statement about the 
case to reporters during a recess 
my credibility is on the line because of this the 
44yearold leader of the rolling stones said 
in testimony wednesday defense witness michael white head of 
the literature and materials department for the juilliard school of 
music gave a technical analysis of the two tunes 
he said the songs including the choruses were very very 
different the melody is so different the harmony is so 
different the rhythm is so different 
on tuesday andrew william thomas who teaches at juilliard had 
testified that his analysis showed the choruses to be virtually 
identical 
white challenged thomas method of analysis and compared chords 
in the songs to colors saying the main color on this canvas is 
green the main color on this canvas is red 
jaggers lawyers contend there was only the barest 
possibility that jagger ever heard alleys song which was played 
on several small new york radio stations in 1983 
they argue too that the similarities are minimal 
alleys chorus goes can i spend another just another night 
just another night just another night with you 
jaggers lines are give me just another night just another 
night with you give me just another kiss just before the dawn 
breaks through 
alleys lawyer charles e baxley said outside the court that 
jaggers percussionist sly dunbar had also played for alley in 
the past and was the percussionist for both recordings 
dunbar was expected to testify for jagger 
baxley said jaggers version netted as much as 6 million 
alley said he has never met jagger and he learned about the rock 
stars song after it was recorded

editors of an engineering magazine 
wednesday defended publication of an article containing details of 
stealth aviation research against criticism including a caller who 
said the writer should be shot 
the article how to design an invisible aircraft appears 
in this months edition of ieee spectrum published by the 
institute of electrical and electronic engineers 
pentagon officials requested copies of the magazine after the 
article was published institute officials said however the 
defense department would not comment publicly 
its dod policy not to comment on whether published 
information is classified said pentagon spokeswoman jan bodanyi 
still according to the magazines editors military officials 
were disturbed 
weve had a few dod calls saying the person who wrote this 
should be shot said west coast field editor tekla perry in palo 
alto calif 
the magazine article says dozens of deltashaped stealth 
fighters built by lockheed aeronautical systems co in burbank 
calif are being flown by pilots of the elite 4450th tactical 
group at nevadas nellis air force base one of the nations most 
classified military reservations 
the article which says that stealth techniques are some of 
the bestkept secrets in the government goes on to detail the 
latest research 
some of the secrecy around the stealth bomber known as the b2 
was dropped wednesday when the air force released a picture of that 
new craft and announced it would make its maiden flight this fall 
executive editor edward a torrero said wednesday that the 
magazine absolutely would not have deliberately published 
anything that it was told was classified 
were not in the business to publish classified information 
he said nothing was not obtained from open literature and 
sources that were knowledgeable about security requirements 
a reported goal of the stealth project is to make a fighter 
planes headon radar signature resemble that of a bird according 
to the technical journal 
research to accomplish that is being conducted at many sites 
including ohio state university the university of pennsylvania and 
georgia tech according to the magazine article 
ohio state is building computer simulation models of stealth 
aircraft to finetune the shape of planes to make them as invisible 
to radar as possible 
commercial airline passengers who fly into philadelphia 
international airport are unknowingly contributing to stealth 
research the article said 
the university of pennsylvanias valley forge research center 
has set up a large radar array that creates twodimensional images 
of planes flying into the airport according to the journal 
as they come in we just use them as targets research 
center technician walter borders told the associated press on 
wednesday 
researchers at georgia tech are using us intelligence data to 
build and test sensors for detecting stealthmodified aircraft the 
magazine said the sensors are then delivered to the government

the pentagon said wednesday it had called off 
the search for a marine helicopter and its two crewmen missing in 
the persian gulf and disclosed it was investigating a radio 
challenge to the aircraft heard before it disappeared 
iran has claimed it shot down the missing helicopter on monday 
as iranian and us forces clashed in the gulf with the exception 
of the two missing marines no americans were injured or killed in 
those battles 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman responded 
to the iranian statements tuesday by noting iran didnt begin 
making the claim until after the pentagon itself announced the 
cobra was overdue from a routine surveillance mission 
in a written statement wednesday the pentagon said 
the joint task force middle east continues to review the 
events surrounding the disappearance of the ah1t cobra helicopter 
in the persian gulf our analysis to date reveals that an unknown 
party was heard challenging an american aircraft about the time 
of the last transmission from the missing cobra 
however there have been no reports of weapons fire or 
explosions in the area in which the aircraft was last known to be 
operating there is no positive evidence at this time to determine 
the cause of the helicopters disappearance 
a pentagon source who requested anonymity said the cruiser uss 
wainwright from which the copter departed on its patrol had 
picked up three different radio calls or challenges to the 
cobra in quick succession 
the calls advised an american aircraft to reverse course 
because it wasnt in international waters said the source of 
course both the wainwright and the copter were in international 
waters so who knows what was going on 
the wainwright was one of three ships that attacked the sirri 
oil platform in the southern persian gulf on monday morning us 
forces destroyed the sirri platform and another one in retaliation 
for last weeks mining of the frigate samuel b roberts which 
injured 10 sailors 
the decision to call off the search operation for the missing 
men was first announced wednesday at the white house by spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
the search and rescue effort was terminated with negative 
results fitzwater said the pilot and copilot have been 
declared missing 
the missing crewmen were identified as capt stephen c leslie 
30 and capt kenneth w hill 33 assigned to squadron hmla167 
based at the new river nc marine corps air station

preliminary results from new tests show that a 
controversial chemical used to regulate the growth of apples does 
cause tumors in mice the environmental protection agency has told 
apple growers 
but epa says it does not yet have enough information for a 
decision on what to do the manufacturer uniroyal chemical co of 
middlebury conn has told the growers it remains confident that 
the chemical sold under the trade name alar eventually will be 
cleared 
epa could announce a decision as early as this fall on whether 
tr which has the scientific name daminozide wroo ban use of alate 
epa assistant administrator john a moore to the international 
apple institute 
the agency began studying daminozide in 1980 and proposed to ban 
it in 1985 but decided to order new studies when its own 
scientific advisers said it had not proved its case it did lower 
the permissible residues in apples and the amount that may be used 
in orchards 
daminozide had been used on about 40 percent of the nations 
apple crop applied in the summer it slows growth the staterun banca 
commerciale 
italys second largest bank would pay 75 a share for 85 million 
shares or 45 percent of irvings outstanding common stock banca 
commerciale also would have the right to buy an additional 10 
percent of irving stock on the open market after the deal was 
consummated 
the original bid announced along with the restructuring plan 
monday was for 65 a share for 95 million shares or 51 percent 
the new plan like the original gives the italian bank four 
seats on the irving board 
bank of new york meanwhile is offering 15 in cash and 1575 
of its common shares for the approximately 95 percent of irving it 
doesnt already own the tender offer set to expire friday began 
last month after regulatory approval 
bank of new york also is running a slate of 16 nominees to 
irvings board of directors 
irving chairman joseph a rice said banca commerciales offer 
would provide shareholders with substantially more value than the 
offer by the bank of new york co and we urge our shareholders to 
reject the bny offer at saturdays annual shareholders meeting 
irving said it believes the banca commerciale deal would have an 
indicated pershare value of between 64 and 7225 figures bank 
of new york has disputed 
bank of new york and a number of analysts say bank of new yorks 
offer of about 64 a share appeared better partly because of the 
timing and regulatory reasons the reason why banca commerciale 
revised its offer in the first place was because they had a 
loser said h rodgin cohen an attorney for bank of new york 
analysts have differed in their characterizations of banca 
commerciale some calling it a friendly white knight that would 
help irving preserve its independence with others labeling it a 
white serf that pales in comparison to the hostile bidder bank 
of new york 
i think they irving shareholders will vote for the bank of 
new york offer said james j mcdermott a banking analyst with 
keefe bruyette amp woods the sophisticated investor is going to 
see the time value 
in a separate news conference bank of new york pointed out that 
not only will the irvingbanca commerciale deal need approval from 
the federal reserve and the new york state banking board but also 
the goahead from italian regulators and that it said could take 
more than a year to achieve 
bank of new york chairman j carter bacot also questioned 
whether banca commerciale had the necessary capital requirements to 
win regulatory approval to win the support of shareholders irving 
also has proposed in its restructuring plan to raise net income by 
about 160 a share in 1988 and 275 next year through 
costcutting measures that include a hiring freeze 
irving reported a 19327 million loss in 1987 after raising by 
450 million its loanloss reserves to cover shaky third world debt 
the restructuring plan includes the sale of some assets such as 
its 50story wall street headquarters and irvings 39 percent stake 
in the swiss bank banca della svizzera irving said it planned to 
pay a 10ashare special cash dividend from the gains on the asset 
sales 
in addition irving proposed boosting its annual dividend to 
450 a share from 242 next month but the fed has objected to an 
increase to that level leaving that portion of the plan in doubt 
bank of new york maintained that with the loss of the dividend 
the bancacommerciale deal was worth less 
of the revised deal cohen said they gave on the front end 
and took away on the back its that simple 
banca commerciale based in milan has assets of around 60 
bilion and is italys second largest bank behind banca nazionale 
del lavoro about 64 percent of banca commerciale is owned by the 
giant state holding company istituto per la ricostruzione

publishing details of reported live 
sightings of american servicemen missing in southeast asia might 
harm the us effort to account for the men the pentagon said 
wednesday 
the pentagons position was spelled out as the defense 
department opposed a pending bill requiring more information to be 
revealed about reports that some american servicemen may still be 
held against their will 
the pentagon lists 2404 us personnel as still missing and 
unaccounted for from the vietnam war and the official us 
position is that the possibility that some are still being held 
prisoners cannot be ruled out 
the bill was sponsored by rep robert c smith rnh who told 
a house foreign affairs subcommittee that families of the service 
personnel are not getting and have not gotten all of the 
information on the live sighting reports or all the information in 
the files 
dozens of powmia family members many of them wearing small 
signs supporting the bill jammed the hearing room 
karl d jackson deputy assistant secretary of defense disputed 
smith telling the pacific affairs subcommittee that our policy 
is to be forthcoming with the families of missing service members 
we consider it essential that the families have confidence in 
our efforts to account for and return their loved ones 
 
 
jackson said the best way to promote this trust lost in 
earlier years is through open communication which we have sought to 
maintain with the families 
jackson said publication of information might have a 
detrimental impact on powmia intelligence investigatory and 
analytical capabilities which we have gone to great lengths to 
develop and strengthen during this administration 
the same view was taken by army col joseph a schlatter chief 
of the defense intelligence agencys special powmia office this 
legislation would adversely impact upon the ability of the us 
government intelligence agencies to collect investigate and 
analyze information 
the bill also was opposed by the national league of powmia 
families whose director ann mills griffiths said the measure 
gives the families no control over the public release of 
sensitive information which could mean endangering the life of 
anyone still held 
in addition the families would have no control over public 
release of information they wish to be held in confidence she 
said 
some individuals have claimed the government is withholding 
information about the existence of pows those contentions have 
been denied repeatedly by administration officials 
the bill was supported by retired army col earl p hopper sr 
who is chairman of the live pow committee which he said is an 
organization representing 1500 powmia family members 
we are suspicious of everything government officials say 
including those in the reagan administration hopper said 
if evidence does not support the existence of live american 
prisoners being held by the communists then there is no logical 
reason for it to remain classified and withheld from the american 
people hopper said 
hoppers son air force lt col earl p hopper jr was shot 
down in 1968 hopper said i assume i have been given most of the 
unclassified information on my sons case i am certain however 
that more information is available in some government files i am 
certain information provided to me is only that which the 
government officials want me to have

a soviet newpaper on wednesday disclosed details 
of the death of a former politburo member who was driven to suicide 
during josef v stalins 1936 political purge 
the labor newspaper trud carried a lengthy interview with 
tomskys sole surviving son yuri and historian oi gorelov 
yuri tomsky was 15 when stalins men came to tell his father he 
was charged with harboring counterrevolutionary sentiments and was 
to be arrested on the same day aug 22 1936 mikhail tomsky shot 
himself 
his son told the newspaper his father was buried in a small 
cemetery outside moscow but that the body was exhumed and stolen 
overnight and he has never been able to learn what happened to it 
the surviving tomsky said his father left behind a letter to 
stalin asking that his family not be subjected to repression 
my two older brothers mikhail and viktor were shot my 
mother was sentenced to 10 years and died in siberia in 1956 
yuri tomsky told the newspaper 
they were all posthumously rehabilitated but i am the only 
one in the family left alivem he said from the age of 16 i 
was repressed 10 years in the camps and nine years in exile 
the trud article was one of many instances in the past year in 
which denounced revolutionaries and political leaders have been 
brought back into the public forum 
historian gorelov said it is understood now that many of the 
early political leaders killed by stalin were trying to preserve a 
healthy kernel in the system of government and their deaths 
came about because the dictator would tolerate no deviations from 
his commandadministration 
tomsky who is not mentioned in soviet encyclopedias or history 
books served as a member of the ruling politburo in 192426 
trud quoted gorelov as saying tomsky was a prominent figure in 
the development of soviet trade unions and a respected comrade of 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin nikolai i bukharin sergei kirov 
and other revolutionaries 
kirov was murdered in 1934 and bukharin executed in 1938

hundreds of thousands of mourners 
followed a gun carriage carrying the flagdraped coffin of a slain 
plo military commander wednesday and they vowed that his martyrdom 
would fuel the fight with israel 
in blood in soul we shall be loyal to our martyr they 
shouted at the funeral for khalil wazir better known by his alias 
abu jihad 
the 52yearold veteran of the palestine liberation organization 
was assassinated saturday by commandos who burst into his home in 
suburban tunis 
the tunisian government and israeli sources have said israel 
carried out the attack but the israeli government has not 
confirmed it 
wazir was buried in the martyrs cemetery at syrias largest 
refugee camp after his coffin was brought from mouwasat hospital 
his mother wife and five children followed as the coffin 
draped in a red white green and black palestinian flag was 
brought to yarmouk camp home to 300000 refugees 
palestinian officials said plo chairman yasser arafat and libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi were on their way to damascus to attend 
the funeral but they did not show up the officials said they 
expected arafat and gadhafi to arrive later but did not elaborate 
hundreds of thousands of palestinians many carrying large 
photographs of alwazir marched behind the gun carriage as it left 
the hospital under heavy syrian protection for the sevenmile 
journey to yarmouk 
we shall carry on with the uprising as you told us read 
placards referring to 4 months of palestinian riots against 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
thousands of other mourners chanting slogans and flashing v 
for victory stood on both sides of the road as the convoy drove 
through damascus others watched from balconies and rooftops and 
showered the procession with flowers 
when the mourners reached the camp south of damascus a group of 
mourners rushed to the gun carriage lifted the coffin out and 
insisted on carrying it to the cemetery 
women in black dresses and scarves emblazoned with the 
palestinian flag wept 
syrian soldiers fired about 60 rounds into the air from 
sovietmade kalashnikov assault rifles as the coffin was lowered 
into the grave 
wazir born in ramleh in what is now israel became a key aide 
to arafat and was considered his heir apparent 
a close aide to alwazir speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he was the leader of the palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories 
the loss of our great hero abu jihad will not put an end to 
the uprising abu jihad left a school behind the aide said in an 
interview 
abu jihad had been recruiting young men and women since the 
plo left beirut in the 1982 israeli invasion these cadres have 
been tried out in several operations where they proved to be 
capable inside and outside palestine 
among the plo personalities who attended the funeral were george 
habash leader of the marxist popular front for the liberation of 
palestine and nayef hawatmeh secretarygeneral of the 
moscoworiented democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
arafat has been at odds with syrian president hafez assad since 
1983 and if he came to the syrian capital it would be at a time 
when arab leaders are seeking to reconcile them 
the plo chairman had not been expected to attend the wazirs 
funeral because of the feud with assad 
gadhafi who only recently reconciled with arafat after a split 
is a close ally of assad who did not attend the funeral 
wazirs body arrived in syria from tunisia on tuesday aboard a 
plochartered plane 
at the united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said in a statement that he is very concerned at what appears to 
be evidence of a further infringement by israel of the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of tunisia 
he recalled the october 1985 security council vote condemning 
israel for an air raid on a tunis suburb israel said it was 
striking at a plo target 
the united states abstained on the 1985 resolution instead of 
using its veto to protect israel as it usually does 
foreign minister mahmoud mestiri will present evidence to the 
security council on thursday that israeli commandos gunned down 
wazir said nouredine kacem first secretary at the tunisian 
mission

a jury wednesday ordered 10 years 
probation and a 5000 fine for a man whose lion mauled a girl at a 
flea market and a judge barred him from contact with exotic 
animals and children 
state district judge ted poe said in augmenting the jurys 
sentence that it was gary durkovitzs fault that roxanne hernandez 
is going to bear the bite of a lion for the rest of her life 
society needs to realize that certain creatures dont belong 
near the city near the public where they can hurt little girls 
i wanted to make sure he never forgot that poe said 
durkovitz 35 whose 350pound pet lion samson attacked the 
8yearold girl at a flea market in houston on oct 10 was 
convicted last week of injury to a child 
the lion tried to put the girls head in its mouth and bit off 
part of her skull exposing part of the brain the girl has 
undergone reconstructive surgery and faces more operations 
after the jury ordered the probation and fine poe imposed 
further restrictions ordering durkovitz to get rid of all his 
exotic animals to stay away from children and to serve 30 days in 
harris county jail 
since the attack durkovitz has been jailed on two charges of 
indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a 
child the cases which are pending stem from his allegedly using 
the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys prosecutors said 
poe also ordered durkovitz to do 20 hours of community service 
work each month with the society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals and said he would have to approve any of durkovitzs future 
jobs 
defense attorney robert scardino said he would appeal the 
verdict 
harris county assistant district attorney alice brown who had 
asked for the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a 5000 
fine said she was not disappointed about the sentence 
durkovitz was walking the lion out of the flea market on a chain 
leash when it attacked roxanne as she walked in front of it 
the girls mother sonia hernandez testified the girl had to 
wear a wig or cap in public and had trouble concentrating 
the lion was shot as it was attacking the girl and was destroyed 
later 
durkovitz who testified he had taken every measure to prevent 
an attack also faces a civil lawsuit in the case

most states spend too little on insurance 
regulation pay inadequate salaries to regulators and fail to 
handle efficiently the average 23000 complaints each receives in a 
year a private study said wednesday 
the advances in state regulation of insurance during the last 
decade have failed to keep pace with the rising sophistication of 
the insurance industry said the study by the consumer insurance 
interest group 
the group which is headed by esther peterson consumer adviser 
to the national association of professional insurance agents pia 
surveyed regulating agencies in 44 states the district of 
columbia puerto rico and the virgin islands agencies in the other 
six states did not respond to an initial request for information 
and were not studied 
ms peterson a presidential consumer specialist in the johnson 
and carter administrations said the study represents a 
breakthrough in relations between consumer advocates and one part 
of the insurance industry the consumer insurance interest group 
which is made up of consumer advocates was initiated and funded by 
the pia 
pia president willis j hargrave jr of houston texas said the 
study found state insurance commissions are more effective than in 
the past but have failed to keep pace with the industry 
hargrave and other pia officials said insurance agents and major 
insurance companies support tighter state regulation of the 
industry to weed out insolvent companies the survey did not 
address the issue of federal regulation of the industry 
hargrave said the most successful departments are in states such 
as florida and new york that spend more than 10 percent of 
insurance premium taxes on regulation he said 
among conclusions of the report were 
less than 6 percent of insurance premium taxes goes for 
regulation which is down from a 7 percent average in 1985 the 
study recommends that states spend a minimum of 10 percent of the 
tax on regulation 
many states lack personnel and resources to properly regulate 
insurers the study recommends enough personnel for financial 
examinations of each insurance company at least once every three 
years which is currently done by less than half the states 
state governments allocate an average of less than 006 percent 
of their budgets to insurance regulation although the average 
consumer spends 15 percent of his or her disposable income on 
insurance 
salaries of state insurance department professionals are far 
below comparable salaries in the private sector and slightly below 
those holding comparable jobs in other branches of state 
government the study recommends a salary audit every two years 
the survey showed annual salaries of state insurance 
commissioners ranging from 33342 in montana to 85656 in 
florida and average examiner salaries varied from 14682 in 
puerto rico to 69875 in kentucky 
the number of consumer complaints received annually is 
overwhelming 23000 per state with only a third of the 
departments having written procedures for handling them the study 
recommends a group be formed by the national association of 
insurance commissioners to develop guidelines for each state 
department to adopt 
many states lack adequate computer systems the insurance 
industry is one of the most sophisticated users of computer 
technology yet some insurance departments are lacking the basics 
in automation the study concluded 
the study also recommends that each state hire at least on 
actuary and one consumer professional

jerusalem to hold some of the 5000 palestinians reported arrested 
it was the fifth new prison set up since december according to law

independence teacher ruth dafnai told a reporter as her sixth 
graders put flowers on graves at the mount herzl cemetery in 
jerusalem 
israeli poets withdrew their support of an international poetry 
festival for the 40th anniversary as a protest of government

leader in modern hebrew poetry 
allen ginsberg of the united states guenter grass of west 
germany and yevgeny yevtushenko of the soviet union had beem

organization leader was killed by israeli commandos israeli 
sources confirmed it but the government has not acknowledged

cattle already have lost much of their flab 
and will lose still more as consumers demand less fat in their 
beef a new study by texas aampm said wednesday 
researchers found that the amount of visible or separable fat 
was down 27 percent in retail cuts from two years ago and the fat 
content of ground beef was down 10 percent 
the study which was released by the agriculture department 
involved supermarket surveys in late 1987 and early 1988 in 
atlanta chicago dallas denver detroit houston los angeles 
new york city philadelphia seattle tampa fla and washington 
dc 
randomly selected retail beef cuts contained an average of 789 
percent separable lean 117 percent separable fat 33 percent 
external fat and 84 percent seam or intermuscular fat and 
94 percent separable bone and connective tissue 
the weighted average of fat content of all retail beef cuts in 
the 1988 survey was 999 percent compared with 1376 percent fat 
in 1986 
h russell cross of texas aampm told a news conference that while 
americans like beef their perception is that its a fatty product 
earlier studies showed marked improvement in consumer 
perception when the outside fat on retail cuts was trimmed to 
onequarter inch of fat or less compared with the previous 
standard of onehalf inch most retailers began using the 
quarterinch fat trim after 1985 
the reduction in separable fat meant that longstanding 
assumptions on amounts of fat americans were getting from beef 
perhaps were not correct and that more uptodate information was 
needed cross said 
as a result the usdas agricultural research service put up 
20000 the cattlemens beef promotion and research board 
20000 and the beef industry council 5000 for the new study 
the project was administered by a foundation of the national 
cattlemens association 
jeff savell a texas aampm colleague said the study found that 
more than 40 percent of the retail cuts had no external fat 
the average fat thickness on steaks and roasts from primal cuts 
or the major wholesale cuts was 014 inch while the average for 
all cuts from chuck roast to stew meat was 011 inch or less than 
oneeight of an inch he said 
we found that the amount of beef fat in american supermarket 
meat cases on a given day is now 12 million pounds less than in 
former years savell said thats 4 billion fewer calories 
a committee of the national research council recently reported 
that americans are eating too much fat and urged the industry and 
government to help correct the situation by breeding leaner animals 
and changing federal grading regulations 
cross said the latest survey showed that in the case of beef the 
lessfat recommendation of the scientific panel is being carried 
out 
the next step in the war on fat is to trim more of the fat at 
the packer level where it can be done more efficiently he said 
eventually we must depend less on butchers knives to get rid of 
the fat and more on production of leaner cattle 
further changes are needed in the marketing system so that 
cattle producers are rewarded financially for turning out cattle 
with less trimmable fat he said

the securities and exchange commission on 
wednesday approved a sixmonth experiment limiting program trading 
on the new york stock exchange on days when the market takes a big 
swing either up or down 
the sec ordered that use of the exchanges computerized superdot 
system be suspended for the practice called index arbitrage 
when the dow jones industrial average rises or falls by 50 points 
traders use index arbitrage to make money by taking advantage of 
momentary price discrepancies between stock index futures and the 
underlying stocks they transmit massive buy and sell orders to the 
chicago futures exchanges or the new york stock exchanges 
depending on whether stocks or stock futures appear undervalued 
under normal circumstances this trading ensures that the two 
markets track each other but an sec study of the october stock 
market crash when the dow fell a record 508 points found that 
index arbitrage accelerated the crash it found that when the 
market is surging up or down program trading can overwhelm the 
stock and futures exchanges 
the sixmonth restriction of index arbitrage which the big 
board has been observing voluntarily since jan 14 is intended to 
dampen the market on its most volatile days 
the sec in a written statement said it was reserving the right 
to remove the restriction whenever such a waiver appears 
justified to foster or maintain the efficiency fairness or 
orderliness of the market 
it said program trading serves a useful purpose and that in 
general the agencys primary focus is on expanding market capacity 
to handle high volumes of trading 
but the statement said in light of the uncertain market 
environment and the need to increase investor confidence in the 
stability of the markets it is appropriate for the exchanges to 
develop experimental initiatives 
the sec said it expects the stock exchange to report back on the 
effectiveness of the restrictions before the sixmonth trial ends 
meanwhile john phelan the chairman of the new york stock 
exchange and leo melamed the chairman of the chicago mercantile 
exchange the largest financial futures exchange have been 
discussing a plan to coordinate closing the markets completely on 
days when the dow swings 200 to 300 points 
they told a house subcommittee last week that they expect to 
reach agreement on the plan within 30 days

output per cow the departments economic research service said

mayor edward i koch campaigned like a candidate 
in the new york democratic primary and lost some say the effort 
may have damaged his ambitions to become the citys first fourterm 
mayor 
i have to work a little harder koch conceded wednesday as 
he looked back at the previous days voting and ahead to his 1989 
reelection campaign he admitted he may be vulnerable 
koch had worked hard on behalf of sen al gore jr of tennessee 
but gores poor showing 10 percent statewide 9 percent in new 
york city raised the question of whether the mayor had done more 
harm than good 
beyond that kochs stinging attacks on the rev jesse jackson 
left many observers wondering if he had finally severed the last 
frayed cords between himself and new yorks large black community 
jackson lost the state but carried new york city a performance 
that raised the hopes of some black political figures who have been 
frustrated in the past by their inability to elect a black mayor 
there will be a black candidate against ed koch in 89 the 
rev al sharpton said at a news conference with other black 
political activists wednesday 
the group suggested several possibilities including manhattan 
borough president david dinkins former borough president percy 
sutton attorney alton maddox jr and sharpton himself 
dinkins the citys highest elected black official said at a 
separate news conference that he had no plan to run for mayor 
however he agreed that the events of the primary would have an 
adverse impact on kochs reelection chances 
others such as democratic party activist mark green used 
stronger words ed koch has to worry that hes lit a long fuse 
that could go off in his face in 89 green told the new york 
times 
exit polls indicated that voters disagreed by nearly 2to1 with 
kochs attacks on jackson and by a margin of 3to2 did not want 
him to run for reelection 
koch as always was unrepentant 
did i hurt myself with people who voted for jesse jackson the 
answer is yes he said did i do the right thing in raising 
these issues i think the answer is yes 
while campaigning for gore koch criticized jackson over his 
policies toward israel saying jews would be crazy to vote for 
jackson and calling him arrogant for failing to march in a salute 
to israel parade 
koch said however that he would endorse jackson if the civil 
rights leader won the democratic nomination but only because he 
believed vice president george bush had the ability to cause more 
harm 
his remarks have drawn criticism from around the city and the 
nation new york daily news columnist jimmy breslin said wednesday 
that koch tried to disgrace an entire city rep john conyers 
dmich said koch has made it very difficult for those that are 
trying to heal race differences 
gov mario cuomo who is among those who have run against koch 
for mayor and lost agreed that many voters found kochs behavior 
in the presidential primary unseemly but cuomo suggested that 
they probably would forget it by next year 
in the past kochs messy involvements in national politics have 
done little to damage his local popularity 
you have done me more damage than any other man in america 
former president jimmy carter is said to have told him in 1980 
after the mayor endorsed carter then criticized his mideast 
policies koch in a refrain familiar to new yorkers later said he 
was only being honest 
his candor has charmed amused and impressed many new yorkers 
over the years but others blacks in particular have found the 
mayor lacking in diplomacy tact and sensitivity 
leadership has an obligation to set the moral tone it has an 
obligation to expand and build a coalition to relieve people of 
their fears and insecurities jackson said wednesday speaking of 
koch the mayor he implied was doing none of that

the city faces a year of too little water and 
too much sewage so it has tentatively decided to order mandatory 
water conservation and curtail building growth in an effort to cut 
down on sewage production 
in the interim mayor tom bradley held a news conference 
wednesday and called for voluntary water conservation 
under the city councils proposal waterconserving shower heads 
and toilet devices must be installed in all businesses and 
residences water cannot be used to wash down patios or driveways 
restaurant diners will have to ask for drinking water if they want 
it and decorative fountains that dont recycle water will be 
banned 
a second council vote is needed for the plan approved tuesday 
as well as the mayors ok and legislative approval before it 
becomes law 
during the marathon session tuesday the city council also 
tentatively agreed to a sewer hookup moratorium that would slow 
growth by 30 percent 
the proposals were initiated by bradley after the citys sewage 
treatment system was reported precariously close to capacity 
in december engineers warned bradley that the system which 
also handles the sewage from more than 20 small cities and 
sanitation agencies would reach capacity and break down by 1992 
if the growth in water use did not slow 
we know of no other growth control measure that equals this 
one said lydia shayne bradleys press secretary 
theres never been any citywide sewer hookup moratorium 
added michelle krotinger press secretary to councilman zev 
yaroslavsky who plans to challenge bradley for the mayors seat in 
1989 
a heavy storm throughout the state tuesday and wednesday did 
little to ease either the los angeles sewer burden or the 
predictions of a state drought 
precipitation during the states rainy season from october 
through april was 75 percent of normal and snowmelt runoff is 
expected to be 35 percent of the normal statewide average 
but added snowpack and water conservation wouldnt solve los 
angeles watersewage problem 
more than a dozen spills of raw and partly treated sewage have 
angered residents especially those along the coast of santa monica 
bay and triggered complaints about the decaying state of the 
sewers 
a partial solution will be ready in mid1991 when a new 
treatment plant is scheduled to open in van nuys but in the 
meantime the city council has to get through the next three years 
under the water conservation plan the department of water and 
power would distribute the watersaving devices free to customers 
but it would cost the utility 4 million and reimbursement would 
be sought in the form of a rate increase later in the year dwp 
deputy general manager duane l georgeson said 
all homes and businesses would need to install the watersaving 
devices on showers and toilets by oct 13 or face a penalty 
surcharge on water bills

the government will allow honduran 
territory to be used for the delivery of us humanitarian aid to 
the nicaraguan rebels the foreign ministry said wednesday 
in another development nicaraguan president daniel ortega said 
in managua that the united states was violating a ceasefire accord 
between his government and the guerrillas by providing humanitarian 
aid 
the honduran government said its decision on aid for the rebels 
was made by president jose azcona hoyo after nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government and the usbacked contras agreed to the 
60day ceasefire starting april 1 
even though the nicaraguan rebels have used honduras a staging 
area in their 6yearold war the honduran government has not said 
it supports them 
few details of the aid operations were made public wednesday 
officials said the us agency for international development the 
us embassy the roman catholic church and the private american 
accounting firm price waterhouse will supervise the delivery of the 
us aid 
the honduran statement said the regional peace plan signed last 
august by the presidents of honduras nicaragua guatemala el 
salvador and costa rica allows delivery of humanitarian aid 
ortega said the american government is already delivering 
humanitarian help to the contras in violation of the ceasefire 
agreement 
the nicaraguan president speaking at a regional meeting of 
agriculture ministers said the pact provides that the aid must 
be delivered once a method of operation is agreed upon 
the ceasefire forged at meetings in sapoa on nicaraguas 
southern border calls for rebel fighters to gather in seven zones 
inside nicaragua 
it allows humanitarian aid to be distributed to the rebels by a 
neutral organization once they have gathered in the zones 
the ceasefire accord also obliges the two sides to discuss a 
permanent truce 
the sandinistas and contras met for the first time in managua 
last the weekend but failed to conclude any broader peace 
agreement they are to resume talks on april 28 
the us congress has approved a 48 million package providing 
humanitarian aid for the contras and wounded children on both 
sides the package includes 10 million for independent 
verification of the ceasefire 
the contras received ciaoperated air drops of both military and 
other aid in a program that ended feb 29 
president reagan ordered 3200 us troops to honduras last 
month after receiving reports that up to 2000 sandinista soldiers 
crossed the border in pursuit of contras the american soldiers 
were airlifted home after training exercises

the head of the occupational safety and health 
administration on wednesday vehemently denied a senate committee 
chairmans charge that the agency has been on a retreat from 
safety under the reagan administration 
there has not been osha administrator john pendergrass said 
in reponse to the accusation from sen edward m kennedy dmass 
i would never for a moment have taken this position if there had 
ever been any hint that there would be a retreat from safety 
pendergrass his assistant frank white and assistant labor 
secretary michael baroody sought wednesday to counter two days of 
previous testimony from career officials in the agency about delays 
in issuing new regulations and efforts by some in the 
administration to weaken existing ones 
kennedy who chairs the senate labor and human resourcs 
committee attempted during the committees hearings to link some 
of those efforts to vice president george bush claiming the record 
shows that bush has personally supervised and pushed the effort 
to roll back health protection for workers 
while a bushchaired regulatory task force called for some of 
the rollbacks in 1981 and has monitored what has been done since 
then the link to bush did not extend beyond circumstantial 
evidence however the testimony did show that baroody and the 
white house office of management and budget played significant 
roles in attempting to carry out some of the task forces 
recommendations 
sen orrin hatch of utah the ranking republican on the 
comittee called the hearings unfair and suggested that kennedy 
should hold another round in the next month and call omb officials 
as witnesses 
baroody meanwhile testified that the agency in the last three 
years has issued 20 new job health and safety regulations compared 
with just 27 such rules in the previous 14 years 
but he agreed with earlier testimony from agency critics who 
said the pace is too slow 
none of us wants to look back 19 years from now and see no 
more than another 47 rules especially if those rules cover no more 
than an additional 47 individual health and safety threats he 
said many of us dont think more of the same is or has to be the 
only choice for osha 
pendergrass cited figures showing that occupational injury rates 
have declined by more than 25 percent and injury rates by 40 
percent since 1973 
those figures are completely distorted inaccurate and dont 
represent whats going on in the workplace kennedy said citing 
testimony from national academy of science experts about problems 
with oshas statistics 
pendergrass acknowledged there are problems with the agencys 
numbers but said they still offer a fair representation of the 
improvements that have occurred 
a 22page report by the congressional research service citing 
information from the national safety council bolstered the claim 
that the agency has somewhat succeeded in reducing fatalities at 
least in the hazardous construction industry 
the unpublished report said osha now is reaching only 11 percent 
of the nations workers with routinely scheduled inspections 
instead of the 78 percent intended when congress created the agency 
in 1970 
but it said all but 2 percentage points of that reduction was 
ordered by congress the supreme court or the carter administration 
before president reagan took office in 1981 
by increments congress and osha with some help from the 
supreme court have done this by ultimately excluding from oshas 
target list essentially all workers except those in construction 
oil and gas extraction maritime operations and highhazard 
manufacturing the report said 
the report was requested by the senate commitee but did not come 
up during the hearings a copy was obtained by the associated press 
oshas relative success in reducing injury and fatality rates 
in the construction industry suggests that osha is getting some 
positive effects from concentrating its limited resources the 
report said 
as a result of the attention on construction pendergrass 
acknowledged that the length of time between routine inspections 
those that are not in response to a specific complaint of 
facilities in other industries is often lengthy 
for example in a highhazard industry like meatpacking he 
said each plant is routinely inspected only about once every three 
years kennedy said that frequency of inspections is woefully 
inadequate

michael dukakis victory in the new york 
primary appeared to nudge a handful of congressional democrats onto 
his campaign bandwagon wednesday as the house decided on its 
super delegates to the national convention 
thirtyeight of the 207 house members approved at a closeddoor 
meeting said they were backing dukakis for the partys presidential 
nomination the massachusetts governor gained the support of 12 
delegates from the time the house nominated its delegate slate of 
205 last week and gave final approval to 207 house members on 
wednesday 
jesse jackson had the backing of 15 house members and tennessee 
sen albert gore jr picked up 12 illinois sen paul simon who 
has suspended his campaign gained 10 house members 
there were 132 uncommitted 
on tuesday democrats in the senate held a ceremonial vote to 
pick their 43 national convention delegates with dukakis garnering 
the support of 13 senators and gore getting seven including 
himself 
simon managed to win only one seat for himself and the backing 
of fellow illinois sen alan dixon twentyone senatordelegates 
remain uncommitted 
the 250 congressional delegates will be among 643 super 
delegates to attend the convention in atlanta july 1821 these 
delegates who include governors members of the democratic 
national committee and other party leaders receive their 
convention credentials based on offices they hold or formerly held 
only new yorks primary and californias on june 7 offer more 
delegates than the behindthescenes primary on capitol hill 
the candidates battling for the 2081 delegates needed to 
nominate have approached the large bloc of super delegates with 
personal phone calls and extensive mailings 
the dukakis campaign which has a wellorganized network for 
communicating with super delegates has not changed its approach 
despite the victory in new york a spokeswoman said 
were not doing anything any differently today than we did two 
weeks ago said susan brophy who handles delegate selection for 
the campaign 
i dont see a deluge ms brophy said hours after the new 
york win however she added that members of congress seem to be 
moving a little more quickly than dnc members 
dukakis remains the frontrunner in the associated press count 
of super delegates with 11765 gore is second with 4755 jackson 
third with 451 and simon fourth with 285 the others are 
uncommitted

a charles town pizza parlor owner whose 
restaurant became a hangout for drug dealers said wednesday hes 
been ordered to vacate his building even though he asked police to 
help drive the traffickers out 
john mao on wednesday said hes been unfairly singled out 
because drug dealers rousted by a police crackdown one block away 
moved into his franks pizza restaurant his landlord has given him 
until may 31 to move out 
charles town city officials say they also may order mao to close 
his pizza parlor once a circuit judge backs an april 12 city 
council resolution allowing them to shut down businesses that 
create a public nuisance namely those that harbor drug dealers 
theyre just using me as a scapegoat mao said wednesday 
it makes me angry i went down there to the police to ask for 
help why are they doing this 
franks pizza which the 30yearold hong kong native bought in 
1980 is located in hilldale shopping plaza in charles town a town 
of 2800 in extreme eastern west virginia when police began 
stepping up patrols in an area one block away frequented by drug 
dealers the dealers started moving into the malls parking lot 
and into franks pizza 
mao said he asked the police department for increased patrols 
around his business he said an officer occasionally strolled 
through his restaurant but it wasnt enough to keep the dealers 
out 
they were so brave and obvious he said they didnt care 
they werent even scared of the police because the police never 
hassled them 
mao said he moved closing time from 11 pm to 7 pm just so 
they drug dealers wouldnt have a place to go 
on april 9 state and federal authorities staged a large raid on 
dealers alleged to be involved in a cocaine trafficking ring based 
in the caribbean since the raid part of which appeared on a 
national abc news broadcast on the drug problem at least 40 people 
have been indicted on charges involving the distribution of crack 
cocaine and marijuana 
after the raid us attorney william kolibash said local police 
officials were told to keep their hands off the crack dealers in 
order not to interfere with the federal and state drug 
investigation 
this drug thing is a terrible thing for the town i was hoping 
it would stay away from the mall said attorney roger perry who 
owns hilldale shopping plaza 
mao said the april 9 raid helped clear the dealers out of his 
restaurant and perry agreed that things have cleaned up since 
then but perry still has told mao he must leave the 10store 
shopping center by may 31 because of the drug activity that 
occurred in the restaurant before the raid 
the activity stepped up so we decided to act perry said 
we only had one recourse he said he thought mao was being 
treated fairly 
the city could also order mao to shut the business down but has 
not because it is waiting on jefferson county circuit court to rule 
on its request for an court order backing up its april 12 
resolution 
if its a nuisance we want it closed charles town mayor 
dc doc master said 
a hearing was scheduled tuesday on the citys request for the 
injunction but master said he and the council decided to hold off 
because they didnt want to call as witnesses undercover officers 
looking into the drug problem 
the hearing has been rescheduled for may 9 
mao said he has tried to talk to master twice and said the mayor 
keeps putting him off master acknowledged that he hasnt talked to 
mao 
i dont drink i dont smoke i dont even have a traffic 
ticket in charles town mao said ive worked very hard in this 
business and i dont want no hassle from either side

the 31 remaining hostages were tense and 
trembling as they filed quietly off the hijacked kuwaiti jumbo jet 
in predawn darkness wednesday to end their ordeal on its 16th day 
the hijackers who murdered two hostages at an earlier stop in 
larnaca cyprus were the first to debark at algiers and they 
slipped away into the night 
kuwaits official news agency kuna citing unidentified algerian 
sources said there were nine hijackers 
the purser on the kuwait airways plane egyptian abdel monem 
mahmoud said after his release wednesday that the gunmen had the 
eyes of a shark 
the air pirates agreed to let the hostages go after arranging 
safe passage with algerian authorities who served as mediators 
between hijackers and kuwaiti officials the gunmen had demanded 
that kuwait release 17 extremists imprisoned for the 1983 bombings 
of the us and french embassies there 
the first of the former captives to descend the gangway were 
anware alsabah and ibtesam alsabah second cousins to the emir of 
kuwait and the only two women left aboard the plane 
wearing thick black veils the women were taken to an algiers 
clinic with their brother fadel khaled alsabah who was suffering 
from a nervous disorder a doctor said algerian authorities said 
the three were not hurt 
floodlights that had bathed the blueandwhite jet nightly since 
it landed in the north african capital a week ago were turned off 
at 9 pm tuesday and never came back on 
most of the freed hostages emerged from their ordeal appearing 
uncertain that their nightmare was really over 
few of them saw the hijackers faces because the gunmen wore 
pillowcases over their heads with holes cut out for the eyes 
the purser mahmoud said the worst moment was when they put a 
gun to the head of one of the passengers their eyes behind 
their masks were sharp and expressionless like those of a shark 
a second hostage 33yearold meteorologist khaled mubarak said 
he glimpsed five of the hijackers through a crack in the toilet 
door from this glimpse and from their voices he said he might be 
able to recognize some of gunmen in the future 
all except the leader i never saw his face and he never spoke 
to us he said 
the hostages said none of them was aware that the hijackers 
killed two kuwaiti security men aboard the plane in cyprus last 
week the hijackers probably used silencers on the guns 
ali kandari 24 looking astonished said i had no idea they 
killed anyone who was it where when 
no hostage reported being tortured or beaten but kandari said 
he saw one hijacker savagely hitting an old man who insisted on 
going to the toilet after being told to sit down 
the man a diabetic was released last thursday and hospitalized 
hostages said they remained handcuffed at all times 
on tuesday night hours before their release the hijackers 
distributed the traditional evening meal served during the moslem 
holy month of ramadan they said then directed the captives to go 
to sleep without allowing them the usual time for prayer 
tadar el khebi a 31yearold businessman said he knew they 
were about to be released when he saw the hijackers going through 
the plane shortly after 4 am wednesday wiping it clean of 
fingerprints two hours later the hostages walked off the plane to 
freedom 
many hostages were in constant fear for their lives 
mahmoud said from the very begining i thought of death i 
thought i would be the first to be killed because they were very 
security conscious and they immediately asked me where i had my 
gun 
my mind kept flashing back to my past at such moments you 
think about things that you never imagined you would remember 
mahmoud said he was in a kuwait airways boeing 727 when it was 
hijacked in 1984 with two american passengers killed 
im happy im still ok he said 
subhi youssef 53 the graybearded iraqi captain of the plane 
sat quietly in the airport vip lounge amid the reporters 
when a reporter asked what he would do after returning to 
kuwait youssef a pilot for 32 years smiled slightly and replied 
i will sit and think about it 
reporters asked youssef how he felt when the hijackers put a gun 
to his head in the cockpit when they seized the plane on april 5 on 
a flight from bangkok thailand to kuwait 
what can you do youssef replied shrugging 
his face showed the fatigue shared by all the hostages 
another hostage a 26yearold lieutenant in the kuwaiti fire 
service who gave his name only as ali said he never lost 
confidence a solution would be found and that he fully supported 
kuwaits refusal to meet the hijackers main demand 
we agree with our governments attitude he said but we 
knew they would help us our government never forgets any kuwait 
citizen 
the plane was carrying 112 people at the time of the hijack but 
hostages were released at stops at mashhad iran and at larnaca

the judge in the irancontra case was accused 
wednesday of making a mockery of three defendants rights by 
limiting their ability to question whether prosecutors illegally 
used congressional testimony as evidence 
lawyers for marine lt col oliver l north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim 
asked us district judge gerhard a gesell to reconsider 
procedures he had established for next mondays hearing on whether 
the prosecutions case is tainted by the use of evidence gleaned 
from the defendants compelled testimony before congress 
the lawyers asked gesell to reconsider his decision not to allow 
them to question grand jurors and a wide range of prospective trial 
witnesses to determine if they were exposed to the defendants 
congressional testimony that was given under grants of limited 
immunity from prosecution 
gesells ruling both in its limited scope and in its failure 
to order discovery relating to the issues of taint makes a mockery 
of the orders of the united states district court for the district 
of columbia compelling defendants testimony before congress the 
defense said 
the order renders hollow the judicial promise that no 
testimony or other information compelled under those orders would 
be used directly or indirectly against these defendants the 
defense brief said 
the defense also threatened to appeal gesells ruling unless 
the court clarifies or modifies this order 
the three defendants and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord who testified on capitol hill without limited immunity 
are accused conspiring to illegally divert profits from the 
usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
in setting mondays preliminary hearing on the immunity issue 
gesell said he would hear testimony from independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh about what safeguards were imposed to prevent 
prosecutors and grand jurors from being exposed to the testimony of 
north poindexter and hakim 
gesell also said the defense could produce one or two grand jury 
witnesses to try to show their secret testimony was influenced by 
the congressional hearings on the irancontra affair 
defense lawyers told the judge they were confidence they could 
draw blood when they questioned such a witness 
but the judge refused to let lawyers question grand jurors or 
individual prosecutors as well as their friends and spouses to 
determine if they were exposed to the congressional testimony of 
north poindexter and hakim 
certainly common sense tells us that there is virtually no 
prospective witness in this case who has not been exposed to and 
to some degree influenced by defendants immunized testimony 
the defense said 
this case is an omelet from which the tainted immunized 
testimony can never be unscrambled the defense said 
the unprecedented dissemination of immunized testimony in this 
case obviously raises paramount issues relating to protection of 
defendants fundamental fifth and sixth amendment rights that 
transcend this case the defense said 
this court threatens to trivialize these constitutional rights 
by deciding significant issues through inaction and by 
establishing procedures apparently intended to spare the 
independent counsel inconvenience and to push the case forward 
that are inconsistent with controlling precedent and that do not 
even begin to protect defendants rights said defense attorneys 
brendan v sullivan jr richard w beckler and n richard janis 
in a hearing last week gesell said he would like to determine 
if it is feasible to begin the trial in july 
the defense asked that the trial be scheduled for next march 
two months after president reagan leaves office the possibility of 
a postelection presidential pardon went unmentioned by the defense 
although the white house denies such a pardon is being 
considered the defense would want to take advantage of such a 
possibility by seeking to delay the trial as long as possible

carlos lehder rivas offered in 1979 to 
sell part of a bahamian island to the exiled shah of iran 
according to a letter introduced wednesday at lehders 
cocainesmuggling trial 
lehder 38 of colombia and jack carlton reed 57 of san 
pedro calif are on trial on charges of conspiring to smuggle 33 
tons of cocaine into the united states from colombia via normans 
cay in the bahamas from 1978 to 1980 
the trial in its 21st week has heard from more than 100 
prosecution witnesses 
on may 3 1979 lehder wrote to shah mohammed reza pahlavi then 
staying at paradise island in nassau bahamas according to the 
letter 
it occurs to me that you might in fact be interested in 
acquiring a portion of the land which we own at normans cay in the 
exumas said the letter 
we are currently working on plans to extend the airport but it 
is our intention to keep the island fairly private as we like our 
privacy and knowing that this is your own feeling we would not be 
adverse to sharing this privacy with you if you are at all 
interested 
six days later lehder received a reply from kambiz atabai the 
shahs chief of protocol rejecting the offer 
the letters were among documents found in four large boxes of 
records from six lehder companies 
the records are being introduced into evidence during the 
testimony of wendell welman a criminal investigator for the 
internal revenue service 
the government is attempting to discredit defense contentions 
that lehder was a legitimate businessman it contends lehder 
operated normans cay as his cocainesmuggling base 
the defense has claimed that lehder planned to develop normans 
cay into a firstclass private resort as one of the documents

attorney general edwin meese iiis choice for 
the no 2 post at the justice department withdrew from 
consideration wednesday as meese struggled to fill toplevel posts 
weve only had a very few resignations meese defiantly told 
a senate subcommittee on capitol hill defending his leadership of 
the justice department and his personal ethics in the face of a 
nearly yearlong criminal investigation 
sen ernest hollings dsc told the attorney general that the 
justice department is seemingly in disarray and asked can 
you continue on efficiently and effectively under these 
circumstances 
the newspapers dont have it quite right meese responded 
theres been considerable exaggeration 
john shepherd the 62yearold former american bar association 
president who meese hurriedly recommended to the white house april 
5 to become deputy attorney general pulled out in the face of 
mounting publicity about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper 
it also was disclosed that longtime meese friend e robert 
wallach now under indictment in the wedtech scandal had 
recommended shepherd to meese for a justice department post in 1984 
or 1985 and that shepherd belongs to an allwhite country club and 
an allmale social club 
meese told reporters he doesnt think he will have any trouble 
at all in filling the no 2 post but he canceled a trip to 
london for a conference on international terrorism at least in part 
to try to fill toplevel department vacancies said department 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
i am concerned about the personal and financial sacrifices my 
family and i were being asked to make in order to accept a very 
difficult shortterm appointment shepherd said in a statement 
my wife and i were not prepared for the pressures to which 
someone recommended for this position at this time would be 
subject shepherd added 
meese was asked about the management problems at a capitol hill 
hearing that also focused on conflictofinterest allegations 
against him 
the associated press reported last week that the justice 
department signed a 50 million lease on the building owned in part 
by howard m bender after his familys foundation routed money to 
the multiple sclerosis society for mrs meeses 40000ayear job 
meese reiterated that there was no connection between the lease 
and mrs meeses job and called the story an outrageous and 
scurrilous attack he said an attempt to discredit him through 
his wife was the lowest form of journalism 
meese said the benders made a charitable contribution and did 
not pay mrs meeses salary 
james bierbower the societys attorney told the ap that mrs 
meese was hired only after the bender foundation made available 
40000 for a development director for operation job match a 
program that finds positions for handicapped people 
bierbower said ms officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to 
hire a development director for the job match program mrs meese 
was the person whom ms officials wanted to fill the position he 
said 
thereafter the officers were able to make arrangements 
that the bender foundation would fund the position for 1986 with a 
40000 grant and that mrs meese would be hired as development 
director he said 
the ms society successfully solicited an additional 40000 
grant from the bender foundation to keep mrs meese on the payroll 
in 1987 the society has a commitment from the foundation to pay 
40000 in 1988 for her salary but the check has yet to be 
received he said 
in comments to reporters meese blamed shepherds withdrawal on 
the news media saying that it was due to all of the raking 
over and the false allegation concerning the bookkeeper 
meanwhile the st louis postdispatch reported wednesday that 
the woman denise sinner made up nearly every portion of her 
background ms sinner told investigators and employers about 
attending college having terminal cancer and performing well in 
past jobs but people interviewed by the newspaper including 
sinners former husband said she had lied 
sinner was convicted in march of stealing nearly 147000 from 
shepherds law firm sinner claimed she had had an affair with 
shepherd and that he had told her to write checks on the firms 
account for her personal use 
shepherd testified during the trial that all her accusations 
were lies 
meese said the intense media attention had a severe 
personal impact on shepherd and his family 
all the adverse information was previously known to the white 
house and the justice department and there is nothing whatsoever 
to suggest that mr shepherd would have had any confirmation 
problems meese said in a statement 
shepherd who hadnt been nominated yet by president reagan and 
whose selection by meese was announced prior to normal white house 
clearance procedures and fbi background checks would have replaced 
deputy attorney general arnold burns whose last day at the 
department is friday 
burns and criminal division chief william weld resigned in 
protest march 29 out of concern that the nearly yearlong criminal 
investigation of meese was hurting the justice departments 
operations morale and public image 
at the senate hearing meese also was forced to rebut 
suggestions by sen warren rudman of new hampshire ranking 
republican on the subcommittee that handles justice department 
appropriations that meese should have a higher level of ethical 
sensitivity 
in a probe that began last may 11 independent counsel james 
mckay has been investigating meeses ties to scandalplagued 
wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project wallach 
represented wedtech and a partner in the proposed pipeline 
there was no such hint no such suggestion and no such 
suspicion no such basis for the most sensitive person to reach 
conclusions that there would be any appearance of impropriety 
responded meese mckays probe of meeses activities is continuing 
five of burns six deputies have now resigned leaving the no 2 
office at the department virtually vacant 
the no 3 office in the department also is nearly vacant with 
the departure last friday of stephen trott to become a federal 
appeals court judge all but one of his deputies also have left 
while it is customary for aides to toplevel appointees to 
depart when the boss leaves aides to meese had asked three 
deputies to burns to stay on following the abrupt resignations of 
the deputy attorney general and weld department sources said 
shepherd was meeses second choice to take burns place the 
attorney general was rebuffed by philadelphia lawyer and former 
federal judge arlin adams who said earlier this month that he had 
a heavy caseload at his law firm and pointed out that he had just 
joined the firm last year

conference he visited the 12 in the central penitentiary where 
they are being held

interrogation under torture in the national investigations

one was available for comment she refused to identify herself 
the case is being handled by judge saul suazo lara 
daniel rivera assistant to the judge confirmed in a telephone

consumer prices shot up 05 percent in march 
as a record increase in clothing costs and higher food and gasoline 
prices triggered the biggest jump in inflation in 14 months the 
government reported wednesday 
analysts said the sharp increase in the labor departments 
consumer price index which translated into a 64 percent annual 
rate of increase demonstrated that the weak dollar and 
unexpectedly strong consumer demand were threatening to ignite a 
new bout of inflation 
they said those pressures would soon prompt the federal reserve 
to step in with a dose of higher interest rates to cool off the 
economy 
the bond market a good barometer of inflation sentiment 
reacted negatively following release of the cpi report but posted 
a small rally later in the day as investors shook off a week of 
inflation worries 
treasurys key 30year bond closed at 9 percent down from 904 
percent the previous day but still higher than the 873 percent 
yield just a week ago bond investors fear inflation because it 
erodes the value of their holdings 
the financial markets were first thrown into turmoil last week 
when an unexpectedly high us trade deficit for february sent the 
dollar plunging and the government reported that the producer price 
index which measures wholesale prices shot up by 06 percent in 
march 
the reagan administration which is counting on the federal 
reserve to keep the economy moving forward through the november 
election contended wednesday that the inflation fears were being 
overblown 
despite large increases for consumer and producer prices in 
march the smaller increases in prices in previous months 
indicate that inflation remains under control said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but private economists disputed that view 
the cpi rise reflects an increasingly widespread inflationary 
environment said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the good news on inflation is over for this year and the question 
now really is how high will prices go 
the march cpi increase followed a modest 02 percent february 
rise and was the biggest monthly gain since a 07 percent increase 
in january 1987 
more than onefourth of the march surge was attributed to a 
record 2 percent spike in apparel costs as retailers boosted prices 
on the new spring and summer fashions especially for womens 
clothes 
analysts blamed the higher clothes costs in part on the weaker 
dollar which boosts the costs of imports if consumers balk at 
paying the higher costs retailers will be forced to offer 
discounts to clear their racks something they had to do last year 
analysts said 
besides clothing retail prices were also driven upward by a 04 
percent gain in gasoline costs the first increase since august 
from september through february pump prices had actually fallen 
59 percent 
but increased world energy demands the success of oilproducing 
countries at limiting production and heightened tensions in the 
persian gulf are putting upward pressure on prices analysts said 
donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting at georgia 
state university said that gasoline costs could well shoot up by 
as much as 4 percent in the april report reflecting big increases 
in pump prices nationwide 
it would be wrong to assume that the march increase is a 
onemonth event he said april is not going to be nice to look 
at either 
but ratajczak said price pressures should ease somewhat after 
that especially if labor costs remain moderate he predicted that 
consumer prices for all of 1988 would rise 44 percent identical 
to the 1987 increase 
in another economic report the labor deparment said americans 
average weekly earnings after discounting for inflation fell 03 
percent in march the second consecutive monthly decline the 
changes left americans inflationadjusted earnings 12 percent 
below a year ago 
the commerce department released a report wednesday showing that 
per capita incomes increased 48 percent in 1987 down from 52 
percent in 1986 when adjusted to remove the effects of price 
increases it was the smallest yeartoyear change since the 
recession year of 1982 
on the inflation report the labor department gaves these other 
details 
grocery store prices rose 04 percent after falling 06 percent 
in february the increase was led by a 46 percent jump in egg 
prices but the costs of fresh fruits meat and poultry were also 
up vegetable prices continued to decline falling 149 percent in 
the first three months of this year that reversed most of the 255 
percent increase in 1987 
new automobile prices rose 03 percent but that increase was 
largely offset by a 14 percent drop in the cost of obtaining car 
loans 
public transportation costs climbed 05 percent reflecting 
widespread airline fare increases 
medical care costs rose 04 percent and have risen at an annual 
rate of 77 percent in the first three months of this year the 
fastestrising segment in the consumer price calculation 
overall retail prices have risen at a 42 percent annual rate 
in the first three months of this year 
the march increase left the index at 1165 meaning that a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing 100 during a 198284 
base period would have cost 11650 last month

the reagan administration won a round in 
skirmishing over trade legislation wednesday raising chances that 
lawmakers might still drop plantclosings provisions believed 
certain to draw a veto 
it is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get 
a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law minority 
leader robert h michel rill said following action in the house 
rules committee 
the panel granted michels request for a floor vote friday on 
whether to send the bill back to a housesenate conference 
committee with orders to strip out the controversial provisions 
requiring employers to provide 60day notice of all but the 
smallest plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the reagan administration has been threatening a presidential 
veto over the plantclosings provision and there are substantial 
doubts about whether enough support exists to override such a veto 
lawmakers whose home districts are hungering for such other 
provisions as repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies 
and massive farm subsidies reportedly have been losing enthusiasm 
for anything that would draw a veto 
the measures central provisions streamline the system under 
which the united states imposes import curbs and takes other 
actions to retaliate against trade violations and aid american 
industries threatened by surges in foreign competition 
if michel wins his battle to send the measure back to the 
conference committee a floor vote on the bill itself scheduled 
for thursday afternoon in the house could be delayed 
the democraticcontrolled rules committee was not obliged to 
grant michels request for a vote to send the bill back to the 
conference committee with instructions to strip out the 
laborbacked plantclosings provisions 
but michel aide joanna schneider said she believed concern over 
how a plantclosings veto could have affected the windfall profits 
tax the farm subsidies and a host of other narrow issues might 
well have prompted lawmakers to scuttle the bill on the floor even 
without sending it back to committee 
rules committee meetings are normally fairly quick but 
wednesdays action was delayed for hours because of democratic 
fears that granting michels request would jeopardize the 
plantclosings provision 
the republican leader had sought earlier to delay action on 
grounds of a rule that newly minted legislation should sit for a 
minimum of three days before going to the passage stage on the 
house floor 
in this case we are dealing with a piece of legislation 1000 
pages long and containing some of the most profound changes in us 
trade law in a decade or more michel said in a letter to rules 
committee chairman claude pepper dfla 
we have yet to see the language in this legislation but 
nevertheless you are clearing the way for a vote for it within 24 
hours he said we are not even certain it will be printed in 
time for the floor vote 
the bill itself is expected to pass the house without much 
trouble when the passage vote comes the major question has been 
whether there will be enough votes to sustain a veto if the 
plantclosings provision remains in

former chief deputy district attorney lynn d compton said he is 
certain material wouldnt have been destroyed by police without 
prosecutors knowing about it he also said he is sure police didnt 
destroy anything of importance 
it always just annoys the hell out of me when selfappointed 
experts surface years later and go at it like agatha christie 
that mentality escapes me said compton now a state appeals 
judge 
files of the investigation and evidence from the 1968 
assassination at the ambassador hotel on the night of the new york 
senators democratic presidential primary victory were made public 
tuesday at the state archives in sacramento 
the items included the 22caliber gun sirhan bishara sirhan 
used to kill kennedy on june 5 1968 in the hotel kitchen 
a certificate showed that 2410 police photographs were burned 
on aug 21 1968 the documents also showed that door jambs and 
ceiling tiles from the hotel kitchen were destroyed 
chief archivist john burns speculated tuesday the photos may 
have duplicated others still in evidence but he said the files 
contain no such statement 
cmdr william booth a police department spokesman said he 
could not confirm that photographs were destroyed but noted that in 
1975 the department notified city council of the routine 
destruction of items gathered as potential evidence but which had 
not turned out to be evidence 
whatever was destroyed was not anything that was needed or 
used as evidence in the trial if photographs were in fact 
destroyed they would have fallen into that category and quite 
likely were duplicates booth said 
greg stone a university of wisconsin political scientist who 
has studied the case for years demanded a probe by the los angeles 
police commission a civilian group whose duties include monitoring 
the police department 
commission secretary bill moran did not immediately return a 
telephone message 
compton said any destruction of material would not have been for 
surreptitious reasons 
it just could have been sheer volume of stuff that doesnt 
mean anything he said in a telephone interview from his home in 
lopez wash 
he speculated the files may include a bunch of peripheral 
material that we didnt feel necessary to use in the court 
presentation there were so many blind leads that were followed 
in the case 
former police chief tom reddin and the man who led the 
investigation thenchief of detectives robert a houghton told 
the los angeles times on tuesday that they also did not recall that 
any photographs were destroyed 
sirhan a jordanian immigrant who scribbled in his diary rfk 
must die is serving a life term at soledad prison secondgun 
theories have haunted the case for many years sirhan says he was 
the lone assassin

gov george deukmejian endorsed vice president 
george bush for the republican presidential nomination on wednesday

and in terms of the leadership he has demonstrated and that the 
vice president has demonstrated his strong support and loyalty to 
president reagan and to republican ideals 
deukmejian said he didnt endorse bush earlier because he had 
made a pledge to all the contenders for the gop nomination that he 
would remain neutral for the june 7 california primary

the race against bush robertson has all but abandoned campaigning 
and concedes he has virtually no chance of getting the nomination

the iranian frigate 
sabalan crippled in this weeks skirmish with us warships was the 
most notorious attacker of neutral ships in the persian gulf us 
officers said 
the captain of the sabalan is a real fanatic said one 
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
hes the one who shoots holes in the tankers in the strait of 
hormuz and then says have a nice day he said tuesday 
us officers appeared generally satisfied with the naval action 
against iranian warships monday though some said the results could 
have been better 
some officers appeared concerned that the sabalan one of the 
iranian frigates hit by us missiles was not sunk 
defense secretary frank carlucci told reporters in washington 
the sabalan attack was not followed up because the ship appeared 
crippled 
senior us officers said the missile exchange monday was over 
as far as the united states was concerned but there was no 
assurance iran felt the same way 
capt donald dyer commander of the desron 22 made up of some 
of the us warships in the gulf said the situation remained 
pretty tense 
but i think its beginning to back off a little bit the 
iranians took some pretty heavy losses i would hope today they 
would disengage he said tuesday 
cmdr edward mann 42 skipper of this 3700ton frigate flying 
the flag of dyers command said he was surprised by irans 
reaction and did not believe the issue of irans predatory attacks 
on neutral commercial shipping has been settled 
there aint a winner until the game is over he said 
the clashes began with the us naval attack on iranian oil 
platforms early monday and continued through the day 
in the action iran fired chinesemade silkworm antiship 
missiles deployed along the strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf 
for the first time 
five of the huge subsonic projectiles were lobbed at the jack 
williams and two destroyers sailing with it 
all the missiles went awry their radar guidance systems 
confused by showers of aluminum chaff fired into the air by the 
american ships 
four went into the sea and one skimmed beyond the williams 
stern and struck an oil rig 
a sixth was fired from iranian positions in the northern end of 
the gulf but officers on the williams did not know what happened 
to it 
lt cmdr carl van dyke a navy spokesman said there were no 
american casualties in mondays actions and iranian casualties were 
not known 
in washington the pentagon called off the search for a 
helicopter that did not return to the uss wainwright on monday and 
listed its two crew members as missing 
the united states claimed one iranian patrol boat sunk three 
armed swedishbuilt speedboats sunk or damaged and two frigates 
disabled 
in addition van dyke said the two oil platforms at sirri and 
sassan in the southcentral gulf were neutralized by naval gunfire 
and by a marine attack 
us officials said both were used for military purposes 
including support for speedboats attacking neutral ships in 
retaliation for iraqi air strikes on irans oil tankers during the 
7yearold war 
when an iranian tugboat at sirri radioed the cruiser wainwright 
for permission to pick up survivors in the water capt james 
chandler the courtly arkansan who commands the 8200ton warship 
agreed and dropped lifeboats 
us officers said the two frigates sahand and sabalan also 
fired on us aircraft after they ignored warnings against taking 
any hostile action 
this happened when the williams surface action group which 
also included the missile destroyer joseph strauss and the 
destroyer obrien received word an iranian flotilla the sahand 
and at least eight boghammer speedboats was approaching from 
irans naval base at bandar abbas 30 miles to the north 
the sahand is in your vicinity take him was the terse 
message from rear adm anthony less commander of the joint task 
force middle east 
us officers said two a6 intruder jets from the uss 
enterprise flying air cover drew missile fire from the sahand as 
they made a reconnaissance flight over the iranian ships 
they retaliated with harpoon missiles that damaged the 
12yearold britishbuilt frigate 
then the strauss sailing just ahead of the williams fired 
another harpoon blasting the ship from 20 miles away 
when last seen by an american pilot it was listing badly with a 
hole in its hull and its superstructure ablaze whether it sank was 
not known van dyke said 
the babaland the sahands sister ship was hit by f14 tomcats 
also flying off the enterprise in the arabian sea 
it was hit by a laserguided clustertype skipper bomb and left 
dead in the water it was not known what happened to the ship since 
the attack

the government outlined a program wednesday for 
expanding marketstyle economic reforms while fighting inflation 
the countrys most pressing economic problem 
reform goals for 1988 include introducing competition for 
company management posts and encouraging city dwellers to buy their 
homes 
so far these measures have been introduced only experimentally 
on a small scale 
the program announced by the official xinhua news agency also 
calls for such antiinflation measures as tightening bank credit 
limiting state investment to major civic projects and limiting the 
rapid growth of workers wages and bonuses 
retail prices jumped 11 percent nationwide in the first quarter 
of 1988 compared with a 73 percent increase in 1987 the price 
increases have generated widespread grumbling 
the reform program was devised by the state commission for 
restructuring the economy which drew up the blueprints for chinas 
transformation from a centrally planned economy to one partially 
directed by market forces 
the commission which was headed by the reformist zhao ziyang 
until he took over as head of the communist party last year now is 
led by the new premier li peng 
the plan bears lis stamp in its emphasis on fighting inflation 
and its lack of new reform ideas li lacks zhaos reputation as an 
innovator and is believed to favor stability over rapid change 
xinhua did not carry comment from li on the plan 
the agency said the plan calls for 80 cities including beijing 
and shanghai to reform their housing systems this year a change 
that is likely to generate widespread public opposition 
most urban houses and apartments are owned by the government or 
by workplaces which rent them for nominal fees 
housing reform intended to save the government money calls for 
rents to be increased in line with maintenance costs and for 
tenants to be encouraged to buy their apartments and houses xinhua 
said the change is to be implemented nationwide within five years 
some local governments have said they will initially give 
citizens subsidies to soften the blow of higher rents many chinese 
pay as little as 135 a month for rent 
under the program described wednesday the government will 
expand its policy of letting stateowned enterprises make their own 
economic decisions and will introduce competition in filling 
management posts xinhua said most managers are currently 
appointed by the government 
the program encourages businesses to use most of their profits 
to improve production and to make sure workers incomes do not grow 
faster than productivity 
economists have blamed rising inflation in part on companies 
using profits to give workers big bonuses 
more enterprises will be allowed to issue bonds to the public 
xinhua said enabling them to raise cash while soaking up some of 
the money supply 
it said the government also will issue bonds to the public and 
banks to make up its projected 22 billion deficit for 1988 
government investment will be limited mainly to major road bridge 
and other infrastructure projects 
banks will issue fewer loans and increase their supervision of 
companies that borrow money the agency said

the senate voted wednesday to give 20000 
taxfree payments to thousands of japaneseamericans who were 
forced from their homes and sent to internment camps during world 
war ii 
final passage came on a 6927 vote after an emotional debate in 
which senators recalled the sometimesharsh treatment and financial 
losses suffered by about 120000 japaneseamericans who were 
interned after japan attacked pearl harbor hawaii on dec 7 1941 
the bill would require the united states government to apologize 
for the mass roundups and would make each of the estimated 60000 
survivors eligible for 20000 payments a similar bill already has 
passed the house 
on votes of 6730 and 6135 the senate defeated attempts to 
strip the bill of the payments while retaining the apology it 
then voted 914 to kill an amendment proposed by sen jesse helms 
rnc to withhold payments until japan compensated american 
families for losses suffered at pearl harbor 
at one point sen spark matsunaga dhawaii was brought to 
tears as he told of an elderly japaneseamerican internee being 
killed by machinegun fire when he strayed too close to a camp 
fence 
but sen malcolm wallop rwyo argued that the internment 
was not a dishonorable act it was the option of a nation in the 
first days of a war 
even if it was dishonorable wallop argued it would be 
repugnant to think a clear conscience is to be had for a mere 
20000 figure honor doesnt come with a dollar sign on it and 
you dont buy it back 
the bill would cost an estimated 13 billion 
gordon hirabayashi a japaneseamerican whose curfew violation 
conviction in seattle led to one of the supreme court rulings 
upholding the internment said like someone whos a victim of a 
serious accident and becomes a quadriplegic no matter whats voted 
in the way of acknowledgement of error itll never be whole 
hirabayashi a retired sociology professor living in edmonton 
canada said japaneseamerican at this stage simply wanted an 
acknowledgement that a wrong was done and a vote for an honorable 
redress they hope that the honorable redress will serve as a 
deterrent for anything like this to happen to any other unfortunate 
group 
george kondo of san francisco director of the northern 
californiawestern nevadapacific region of the japaneseamerican 
citizens league said i think we deserve everything thats 
coming to us at least they are recognizing the fact that there 
was a wrongful act against their own citizens 
pleased would be an understatement said cherry kinoshita of 
seattle who was interned at minidoka in idaho in 1942 at the age 
of 18 and who has been active in seeking redress since 1976 
weve been working for over 10 years to see this happen i 
think its great to see our nation admit an error and take steps 
to remedy what was a great injustice she said 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii a japaneseamerican who lost his 
right arm in combat with the army in italy said these payments 
acknowledge the unconstitutional deprivation of liberty and the 
stigma of being deemed unloyal 
if i were interned i would consider 20000 too little 
inouye said 
opponents in addition to objections over the payments 
complained about a statement in the bill that the internment was 
caused by racial prejudice war hysteria and a failure of political 
leadership 
hindsight has proven us wrong said sen chic hecht rnev 
but i cannot in good conscience go back and tell survivors of 
bataan iwo jima and all those battles in the south pacific and 
tell them we have forgotten you but we are compensating the people 
who we moved into camps hecht said 
matsunaga the bills chief sponsor recalled in a floor speech 
that he was an army officer serving in hawaii on dec 7 1941 
matsunaga a japaneseamerican recalled the story of an elderly 
internee who was playing softball with his nephew when a ball 
strayed too close to a fence 
when the guard told the man to halt matsunaga quoted him as 
replying its all right im just going to pick up the 
softball 
he moved forward and was killed by a burst of fire from the 
guards machine gun matsunaga told the senate 
at that point matsunaga halted in midsentence unable to keep 
his voice from breaking despite several attempts to resume speaking 
i myself become overly emotional when i think about it even to 
this day he said after regaining composure 
the measure is similar to a bill passed by the house last sept 
17 by a 243141 margin the senate version however authorizes 
payments of up to 12000 for surviving members of the aleut indian 
tribes who were forcibly removed from the aleutian islands during 
the japanese attack on those islands in 1942 
that and other minor differences would have to be worked out 
before the bill could go to president reagan who has been urged to 
veto it by the office of management and budget because of its 13 
billion price tag 
matsunaga asked about veto prospects said we have mixed 
reports from the white house the white house supported the 
measure going into the vote said bj cooper a spokesman but it 
had also wanted certain changes to the bill such as the deletion 
of the aleutian island payments which were not made cooper said 
he did not know the white house position on the bill that was 
passed 
the internment camps arose from a 1942 order by president 
franklin d roosevelt that said the war department could designate 
military areas from which people could be excluded 
later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of 
japanese ancestry from california washington and oregon and some 
in hawaii the orders affected 77000 us citizens and 43000 
legal and illegal resident aliens all were taken to prison camps 
in the western states 
the last camp was closed in january 1946 
in all about 120000 people of japanese ancestry were detained 
in the camps including 77000 american citizens an estimated 
60000 are still alive and the bill would allow them to claim 
individual 20000 payments in return for waiving any further 
wartime claims against the government 
congress has already awarded about 38 million in restitution 
payments since the passage of a 1948 evacuation claims law five 
years ago however a federal commission estimated that the 
japaneseamericans had suffered losses of up to 2 billion that had 
never been compensated 
about 900 aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live 
in abandoned mines canneries and camps about 2000 miles away 
lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and 
death and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in their 
absence 
about 450 aleuts survive and would be eligible for 12000 
payments another 20 million would benefit aleut villages and 
provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe

zetas offices and eight miles east of downtown police said a 
possible witness was being questioned by baja california state 
judicial police dominguez said 
felix had founded zeta with his longtime friend and partner 
jesus blancornelas 
right now we are recovering from the shock blancornelas 
said in a telephone interview the government has said that it 
respects freedom of expression and that the police are among the 
most advanced we hope that both those things might be 
demonstrated 
felix had been with zeta since 1980 he wrote a column for the 
weekly which is published in the mexican border city and 
distributed throughhout baja california it has a circulation of 
60000 
he was a satirist he was very well known and popular here in

said felix had no known enemies and called the shooting an act of 
cowards aimed at muzzling the press 
felixs column a little bit of something dealt with 
everday occurences in the states political and social life he 
often focused his sarcasm on government officials and business 
people chiding them for what he termed knowitall attitudes and 
arrogance 
he had a sense of humor with a lot of spark that left many 
uncomfortable especially officials blancornelas said 
last year zeta offices were sprayed with bullets from a passing 
car no one was injured and police never found those responsible

the house voted 213201 wednesday for a bill 
that would make the first change in the nations landmark 
immigration law by extending the amnesty deadline for illegal 
aliens from may 4 to nov 30 
house passage of the measure sent the proposal to an uncertain 
fate in the senate where opponents could use delaying tactics 
the reagan administration opposes the bill and the chief of the 
nations immigration service alan nelson has said he would 
recommend a veto if the measure reached the presidents desk 
the immigration and naturalization service warned late wednesday 
that because of opposition in the senate and the possibility of a 
presidential veto an extension of the deadline was by no means 
certain 
ins is concerned that this misguided legislation will create 
confusion among potential applicants and cause them to delay filing 
beyond the may 4 cutoff date the service said in a statement it 
said legalization offices would remain open on may 4 until midnight 
to process applications and that aliens should continue to expect 
that the last date to apply was may 4 
the immigration law signed by president reagan in november 1986 
was finely tuned legislation that carefully balanced a legalization 
program for illegal aliens with penalties for employers who 
knowingly hiring undocumented workers 
under the law those who have lived illegally in the united 
states since before jan 1 1982 had one year until may 4 to 
apply for temporary residency 
approval by the immigration and naturalization service for 
temporary residency allows the aliens to live and work in the 
united states while they go through a longer process for permanent 
residency and citizenship 
those favoring the extension contended the ins was slow in 
writing rules for the temporary amnesty program and said many of 
those who initially feared the agency were at first reluctant to 
come forward and apply 
the fears existed the supporters said even though the law 
prohibits immigration officials handling amnesty claims from 
sharing their information on illegal aliens with the ins 
enforcement agents 
i am convinced that hundreds of thousands of potentially 
eligible applicants have not applied and may not be able to apply 
by the current may 4 deadline said house judiciary committee 
chairman peter w rodino dnj 
rep romano l mazzoli dky the chief sponsor of the 
extension said 12 million aliens have applied for amnesty and 
729000 have received temporary residency cards another 400000 
have applied for legalization under a separate program for 
agricultural workers but that program is not affected by the bill 
mazzoli said the number of applicants for the general amnesty 
program was sizeable but falls short of the numbers anticipated 
he said that leaving additional illegal aliens in the country 
would also mean a greater potential pool of undocumented workers 
which the sanctions program is trying to wipe out 
the congressional budget office estimated that the bill would 
increase expenditures by 270 million through fiscal 1993 to pay 
for administrative costs reimbursements to states and federal 
benefit programs 
but supporters of the extension said fees charged applicants 
will pay for much of the program and added that the remaining 
costs already have been appropriated 
the chief opponent of the extension rep patrick l swindall 
dga pointed out that the amnesty provisions of the law only 
passed the house by seven votes in 1986 
if american citizenship is not worth filling out an 
application today what in the world is he asked 
and rep marge roukema rnj another opponent said it was 
incomprehensible and would add insult to injury to pass the 
measure while those applying under the legal immigration system 
have to wait for years to gain residency 
rep dan lungren rcalif said he supported the extension 
because the proposal is not an expansion of the legalization 
program it does nothing to increase the number of eligible 
people to be found he said 
an opponent rep harold rogers rky said the proposal will 
do violence to a delicately balanced finely tuned piece of 
work 
we begged people to fill out the papers and seek legalization 
how much longer do you want to beg people to apply enough is 
enough he said 
before the final vote the house approved by voice vote an 
amendment that designed to cut down on fraud during the extension 
period 
sponsored by rep clay shaw rfla the language would permit 
the ins to use any documents found to be fraudulent during the 
extension period in deportation proceedings 
the house also defeated an amendment that would have only 
accepted applications after may 4 from aliens who could demonstrate 
good cause for missing the deadline 
the proposal by rep george gekas rpa which would have 
included health or logistical reasons as good cause was 
defeated 167246

a tass official said on wednesday that changing 
conditions in the soviet union could help lead to a visit by pope 
john paul ii 
anatoly a krasikov deputy director general of tass and a 
former rome correspondent for the official soviet news agency was 
asked at a news conference if the soviet government wanted a visit 
by the pope 
there are no conditions on either part for a papal visit 
but conditions in the sense of climate is another thing 
he replied 
i am absolutely sure that this climate is being created 
the question of a possible visit by the roman catholic leader to 
the officially atheist country has been raised in particular 
because 1988 is the 1000th anniversary of the advent of 
christianity in the area now called the ukraine 
in a document released on tuesday the pope called for religious 
freedom for catholics in the ukraine john paul has often expressed 
his wish to go to the soviet union but has said he would go there 
only if allowed to visit roman catholics throughout the country 
including the ukraine 
he also wants to be able to visit lithuania 
before taking questions from reporters krasikov said he wanted 
to talk about important developments in his country 
we are all searching together for truth in the 
construction of society we want more democracy krasikov 
said reflecting about the soviet union under mikhail s gorbachev 
he said that with this point of view freedom of religion is 
important

next weeks meeting of nato defense 
ministers to review nuclear arms issues will be moved from denmark 
to brussels because of a political crisis in denmark over nuclear 
arms policy sources said wednesday 
they quoted danish envoy otto broch as saying at wednesdays 
weekly session of nato ambassadors he preferred that the ministers 
not hold their april 2728 meeting in kolding denmark as 
scheduled 
instead the meeting will be held in brussels said one 
source 
the sources spoke on condition of not being identified 
a danish official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the change of venue was agreed to in consultation with the 
nato secretary general and the other nato members 
the decision was reached of course in light of the election 
situation in denmark 
another source said the nato envoys expressed serious 
concern about the danish parliaments passing a resolution last 
week asking the government to tighten its ban on nuclear arms 
nato secretarygeneral lord carrington said in a statement the 
resolution if implemented would have serious repercussions and 
would run counter to nato strategy 
on tuesday prime minister poul schlueter called for early 
elections may 10 his minority centerright government opposed the 
resolution 
it requires the government to tell visiting warships they cannot 
bring nuclear arms into danish ports for 31 years denmark has had 
a policy of banning nuclear arms from its soil 
denmark also does not allow the permanent basing of allied 
troops on its territory 
north atlantic treaty organization officials say the resolution 
takes the nuclear ban position too far and is embarrassing to 
denmarks allies 
the united states and britain which would play a key role in 
reinforcing denmark at a time of crisis as a matter of policy 
never confirm or deny their warships carry nuclear arms 
carringtons statement said the resolution would run counter 
to the basis of nato strategy and undermines the principles of 
shared burdens and benefits 
in 1984 new zealand began insisting that visiting warships 
state whether they carried nuclear arms this led to a cutoff of 
its military cooperation with some other nations including the 
united states 
the nato defense ministers will meet as the alliances nuclear 
planning group which reviews only nuclear arms issues 
at the ambassadors meeting us envoy alton keel restated the 
reagan administrations deep regret over passage of the 
resolution sources said

attorney general edwin meese iiis choice for 
the no 2 post at the justice department withdrew from 
consideration wednesday as meese struggled to fill toplevel posts 
weve only had a very few resignations meese defiantly told 
a senate subcommittee on capitol hill defending his leadership of 
the justice department and his personal ethics in the face of a 
nearly yearlong criminal investigation 
sen ernest hollings dsc told the attorney general that the 
justice department is seemingly in disarray and asked can 
you continue on efficiently and effectively under these 
circumstances 
the newspapers dont have it quite right meese responded 
theres been considerable exaggeration 
john shepherd the 62yearold former american bar association 
president who meese hurriedly recommended to the white house april 
5 to become deputy attorney general pulled out in the face of 
mounting publicity about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper 
it also was disclosed that longtime meese friend e robert 
wallach now under indictment in the wedtech scandal had 
recommended shepherd to meese for a justice department post in 1984 
or 1985 and that shepherd belongs to an allwhite country club and 
an allmale social club 
meese told a senate appropriations subcommittee that he would 
appoint an acting deputy while he searches for a replacement to 
fill the post he subsequently told reporters that he did not rule 
out the possibility of appointing his counselor william bradford 
reynolds 
a reynolds appointment would provoke a storm of criticism on 
capitol hill where the senate three years ago rejected meeses bid 
to have reynolds confirmed as associate attorney general the no 3 
post in the department 
meese refined his remarks later wednesday afternoon with 
department spokesman terry eastland saying that no decision has 
been made on whether to appoint an acting deputy 
meese told reporters he doesnt think he will have any trouble 
at all in filling the no 2 post but he canceled a trip to 
london for a conference on international terrorism at least in part 
to try to fill toplevel department vacancies said department 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
i am concerned about the personal and financial sacrifices my 
family and i were being asked to make in order to accept a very 
difficult shortterm appointment shepherd said in a statement 
my wife and i were not prepared for the pressures to which 
someone recommended for this position at this time would be 
subject shepherd added 
meese was asked about the management problems at a capitol hill 
hearing that also focused on conflictofinterest allegations 
against him 
the associated press reported last week that the justice 
department signed a 50 million lease on the building owned in part 
by howard m bender after his familys foundation routed money to 
the multiple sclerosis society for mrs meeses 40000ayear job 
meese reiterated that there was no connection between the lease 
and mrs meeses job and called the story an outrageous and 
scurrilous attack he said an attempt to discredit him through 
his wife was the lowest form of journalism 
meese said the benders made a charitable contribution and did 
not pay mrs meeses salary 
james bierbower the societys attorney told the ap that mrs 
meese was hired only after the bender foundation made available 
40000 for a development director for operation job match a 
program that finds positions for handicapped people 
bierbower said ms officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to 
hire a development director for the job match program mrs meese 
was the person whom ms officials wanted to fill the position he 
said 
thereafter the officers were able to make arrangements 
that the bender foundation would fund the position for 1986 with a 
40000 grant and that mrs meese would be hired as development 
director he said 
the ms society successfully solicited an additional 40000 
grant from the bender foundation to keep mrs meese on the payroll 
in 1987 the society has a commitment from the foundation to pay 
40000 in 1988 for her salary but the check has yet to be 
received he said 
in comments to reporters meese blamed shepherds withdrawal on 
the news media saying that it was due to all of the raking 
over and the false allegation concerning the bookkeeper 
meanwhile the st louis postdispatch reported wednesday that 
the woman denise sinner made up nearly every portion of her 
background ms sinner told investigators and employers about 
attending college having terminal cancer and performing well in 
past jobs but people interviewed by the newspaper including 
sinners former husband said she had lied 
sinner was convicted in march of stealing nearly 147000 from 
shepherds law firm sinner claimed she had had an affair with 
shepherd and that he had told her to write checks on the firms 
account for her personal use 
shepherd testified during the trial that all her accusations 
were lies 
meese said the intense media attention had a severe 
personal impact on shepherd and his family 
all the adverse information was previously known to the white 
house and the justice department and there is nothing whatsoever 
to suggest that mr shepherd would have had any confirmation 
problems meese said in a statement 
shepherd who hadnt been nominated yet by president reagan and 
whose selection by meese was announced prior to normal white house 
clearance procedures and fbi background checks would have replaced 
deputy attorney general arnold burns whose last day at the 
department is friday 
burns and criminal division chief william weld resigned in 
protest march 29 out of concern that the nearly yearlong criminal 
investigation of meese was hurting the justice departments 
operations morale and public image 
at the senate hearing meese also was forced to rebut 
suggestions by sen warren rudman of new hampshire ranking 
republican on the subcommittee that handles justice department 
appropriations that meese should have a higher level of ethical 
sensitivity 
in a probe that began last may 11 independent counsel james 
mckay has been investigating meeses ties to scandalplagued 
wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project wallach 
represented wedtech and a partner in the proposed pipeline 
there was no such hint no such suggestion and no such 
suspicion no such basis for the most sensitive person to reach 
conclusions that there would be any appearance of impropriety 
responded meese mckays probe of meeses activities is continuing 
five of burns six deputies have now resigned leaving the no 2 
office at the department virtually vacant 
the no 3 office in the department also is nearly vacant with 
the departure last friday of stephen trott to become a federal 
appeals court judge all but one of his deputies also have left 
while it is customary for aides to toplevel appointees to 
depart when the boss leaves aides to meese had asked three 
deputies to burns to stay on following the abrupt resignations of 
the deputy attorney general and weld department sources said 
shepherd was meeses second choice to take burns place the 
attorney general was rebuffed by philadelphia lawyer and former 
federal judge arlin adams who said earlier this month that he had 
a heavy caseload at his law firm and pointed out that he had just 
joined the firm last year

presidential contender sen albert gore jr 
ran up a debt of 16 million before the new york primary where the 
fruits of his spending reaped only 10 percent of the vote this 
week his financial statement showed wednesday 
gore has lost his eligibility for federal matching funds and 
would need to attain an unlikely 20 percent of the vote in 
pennsylvanias primary next week in order to restablish his 
eligibility 
however if he drops out of the race he would be able to 
receive federal matching funds to retire the debt under election 
law 
on the republican side of the presidential race former tv 
evangelist pat robertson continued to borrow heavily to keep his 
campaign afloat but since he is bumping up against the spending 
limit he has had to dramatically scale back his massive campaign 
operation his campaign report showed wednesday 
robertson spent 78 million during march alone just repaying 
some of his previous bank loans 
robertson technically remains a candidate but has conceded that 
vice president george bush will win the nomination 
gore who was expected to suspend his campaign thursday 
personally loaned his campaign 40000 and took out bank loans of 
14 million during march according to his campaign finance report 
filed with the federal election commission 
most of that was for the super tuesday series of primaries in 20 
states on march 8 
meanwhile massachusetts gov michael dukakis who established 
himself in new york as the clear frontrunner is continuing his 
flush financial status his report shows 
and the other democrat still in the race jesse jackson raised 
28 million in his biggest fundraising month ever that included 
2 million from contributors 330189 in federal matching funds 
and a 250000 loan 
jackson ended the month with 865946 in cash on hand a 
outstanding bills of 678973 
dukakis had burst in fundraising in march with 34 million in 
total receipts and ended the month with 17 million in cash on 
hand to cover 697162 in bills and to propel him into the costly 
new york race 
dukakis receipts included 621098 in federal matching funds 
the 24 million he got from contributors was up from his february 
total of 13 million in donations 
gore also had a substantial fundraising month in march taking 
in 34 million of which 336312 was matching funds and 12 
million came from contributions 
he ended the month with a debt of 16 million with only 
416603 in cash on hand his aides had said he would need no 
additional loans to spend 1 million on a costly new york media 
campaign but aides subsequently disclosed that he borrowed at 
least 100000 
bush is effectively finished with fund raising having raised 
the maximum 27 million that election law permits primary 
candidates to spend during march he raised 17 million of which 
247118 was in the form of federal matching funds 
he ended the month with 36 million in the bank and close to 1 
million in outstanding obligations at the end of march he had 
spent 189 million against the base spending cap of 23 million 
plus the maximum 46 million allowed for fundraising expenses 
bushs treasurer fred bush said earlier this month that overall 
fund raising for the campaign had hit 30 million that included 3 
million for legal and accounting costs which are not subject to 
the spending limit 
robertson was already within 2 million of the spending ceiling 
as of super tuesday 
in his new report covering the month of march he reported 
raising 23 million of which 896551 were federal matching 
funds and 873444 was money from contributors by the end of 
march he had spent 20 million against the 23 million base cap 
plus the full 46 million fundraising allocation his report 
showed 
robertson ended march with 14 million in debts and only 
61890 in cash on hand 
he personally loaned his campaign 25000 and took out 385000 
in bank loans he spent 78 million paying off previous loans 
gop contender jack kemp the congressman from new york who 
dropped out of the race during march is still in debt he ended 
the month 672826 in the red but was anticipating more than 
500000 in federal matching funds to help retire that he had only 
57741 in the bank after raising 604586 during the month

jesse jackson showing strength in some 
of vermonts smallest most rural communities finished first 
wednesday in an unofficial count of democratic state delegates 
elected in local caucuses 
with all of the states communities reporting results from 
tuesday nights caucuses an unofficial count by the associated 
press gave jackson 589 state convention delegates compared with 
581 for michael dukakis there were 116 uncommitted delegates 
elected while sen albert gore picked up four delegates 
the ap count showed the race so close that the official party 
tabulation expected next week could place either jackson or 
dukakis out front 
jackson bested dukakis the governor of neighboring 
massachusetts in vermonts largest city of burlington and he won 
in many of the states smallest most rural communities 
the delegates elected tuesday night will attend next months 
state convention at which time 14 of vermonts 19 delegates to the 
national convention will be chosen the remaining five spots belong 
to gov madeleine kunin a dukakis backer and four state party 
officials all but one of whom are likely to support dukakis 
the townbytown returns showed that with the exception of 
burlington dukakis did best in the larger communities while 
jackson picked up delegates in the smallest towns 
its a tremendous victory for us said liz blum the jackson 
state coordinator 
we would sure like to have 10 more votes said william 
wasserman the dukakis state coordinator we knew it would be 
close 
we have a very high regard for the excellent field work the 
jackson campaign did said wasserman they organized in the 
smallest of communities as well as the larger ones that showed 
real persistence real dedication to detail 
dukakis had won vermonts presidential primary march 1 winning 
56 percent of the vote while jackson gained 26 percent but the 
primary was nonbinding and had nothing to do with the selection of 
delegates

the supreme court said wednesday the 
government may continue viewing alcoholism as willful 
misconduct rather than an uncontrollable disease when awarding 
veterans education benefits 
but the justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism is 
a disease noting that the medical community remains sharply 
divided on that issue 
instead the 43 decision said the veterans administration did 
not violate a law protecting the rights of the handicapped when it 
refused to extend education benefits to two men for more than 10 
years after they left the service 
the two men said they failed to apply earlier for the gi 
benefits because they were disabled by their alcoholism 
wednesdays ruling is not expected to affect veterans medical 
benefits the va provides medical benefits to help exgis recover 
from alcoholism without imposing any time limit 
in another ruling wednesday the court upheld 71 a law 
requiring municipal or state bonds issued after june 30 1983 to 
be registered before they can be taxexempt 
the justices ruled that the federal law enacted to discourage 
tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does not violate any 
states sovereign immunity 
south carolina had challenged the law with more than half the 
states supporting it south carolina argued that the law will hurt 
state and local governments by forcing them to chose between 
continuing to issue unregistered bonds for which investors will 
have their interest taxed or paying sizeable registration fees 
the law which took effect july 1 1983 is aimed in part at 
discouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or are 
passed on to an heir while the interest on government bonds is 
exempt from federal income tax the bonds are taxed as gifts or as 
part of an estate 
state and local governments issue bonds to finance various 
projects such as building roads and schools 
groups that help alcoholics said they were disappointed by the 
courts ruling in the veterans case while suggesting its impact 
may be limited 
christine lubinski of the national council on alcoholism said 
certainly this is a blow to us and to morale however we 
feel the state of the art in terms of both public awareness about 
alcoholism as well as the successful treatment of alcoholism will 
prevail 
the decision was welcomed by norma phillips president of 
mothers against drunk driving she said it might encourage judges 
to give tougher sentences in drunkendriving cases even though that 
was not even indirectly an issue in the case 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 80 in a florida case that unions may distribute 
handbills urging consumers to boycott neutral employers against 
whom the unions have no grievance 
ruled by a 62 vote in a california case that forcing employers 
to provide free internal mail delivery for labor union literature 
aimed at organizing employees does not violate the federal law 
giving the us postal service a monopoly 
justice byron r white writing for the court in the alcoholism 
ruling said the federal rehabilitation act of 1973 does not force 
the va to treat alcoholism as a disease 
the law bars federal programs or anyone receiving federal aid 
from discriminating against handicapped individuals solely because 
of their handicap 
in our view it is by no means clear that the law and the 
characterization of primary alcoholism as a willfully incurred 
disability are in irreconciliable conflict white said 
those who believe there is a conflict should ask congress to 
change the law he said 
justice harry a blackmun in a dissenting opinion said the va 
should examine benefit claims by veterans on an individual basis 
rather than concluding automatically that the condition is a 
product of willful misconduct 
this is the very kind of broad social generalization that the 
rehabilitation act is intended to eliminate he said the 
petitioners in these cases ask only that their situations be given 
individualized evaluation 
seeking va education benefits were eugene traynor 46 a 
supervisor in a new york city photography laboratory and james p 
mckelvey 42 an alcoholism counselor in rockville md 
both men who said they began drinking when they were children 
received honorable discharges from the army in the late 1960s they 
said they took their last drinks in the early 1970s before being 
hospitalized and treated for the condition 
the va authorizes payment of education benefits to veterans 
within 10 years of their discharge no benefits are paid after 10 
years unless a veteran can show he or she was unable to pursue an 
education because of a physical or mental disability which was 
not the result of such veterans own willful misconduct 
the va provides an exemption from the 10year time limit for 
alcoholism only when it is a secondary symptom of some other 
psychiatric disorder 
traynor and mckelvey sued the va charging the agency with 
discriminating illegally against the handicapped 
federal appeals courts ruled against them in separate decisions 
mckelvey said the wednesday ruling sends an unfortunate message 
to people fighting alcoholism 
i believe that the justices who ruled in favor of the 
veterans administration are giving them a license to kill more or 
less mckelvey said theyre saying that the veterans 
administration can violate existing federal statutes and get away 
with it 
the cases attracted widespread attention because of the current 
renewed debate over the nature of alcoholism many programs have 
developed in recent years that treat alcoholics as victims of a 
disease rather than as social deviants or criminals 
the psychiatric professions diagnostic and statistical manual 
of mental disorders calls alcohol abuse and dependence a disease 
and says about 13 percent of all americans suffer from it at some 
point in their lives 
joining white in ruling for the va were chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor 
blackmun was joined in dissent by justices william j brennan and 
thurgood marshall justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
did not participate in the case

wednesday to have been tied up and shot by intruders in his home 
but excolleagues suggested he staged the attack 
doyle f wheeler was treated at a hospital and released tuesday 
after authorities found him at home with a gunshot wound said 
stevens county sheriff richard andres the shot grazed his head 
andres said 
wheeler said he was attacked by three men 
he wheeler reported that someone tried to kill him but 
there was only a graze wound and powder burn san diego police 
chief bob burgreen told the san diego tribune he was handcuffed 
tied up and had to dial 911 with his tongue i find all of this 
very interesting 
it was absolutely physically impossible for me to do it to 
myself wheeler said it is impossible to hogtie and shoot 
yourself 
local authorities have refused to release details about the 
shooting and have declined comment on any connection to wheelers 
testimony on behalf of sagon penn who was acquitted of murder and 
attempted murder in the 1985 shooting of two san diego police 
officers 
wheeler testified the 1985 shooting was a racially motivated 
attack provoked by the white officers penn is black

in the car which is missing 
they intended to kill me and they thought they killed me 
wheeler told the spokane chronicle on wednesday i am afraid for 
my life i have my family in a safe place and i will be joining 
them 
the incident makes no sense harry o eastus ii a police 
officer and director of the san diego police officers association 
told the san diego tribune on wednesday the association is the 
officers union 
based on wheelers past performance there is a strong 
likelihood that he could have done that to himself or paid sombody 
to do it eastus said 
wheeler who was a member of the san diego force on and off for 
about 10 years left the department briefly in 1977 on 
stressrelated disability san diego police said he retired on 
stress disability in 1985 police said

had called station anchorman michael tuck two weeks ago to report 
threats against his life and tucks tuck had plans for a tv movie 
about the penn case 
the san diego tribune quoted tuck as saying wheeler warned him 
that a member of the san diego police department told him that 
officers planned to kill tuck and wheeler 
the sheriff said investigators had sent evidence from the 
wheeler home to a spokane crime lab for analysis

hijackers with eyes of sharks wiped 
out their fingerprints and slipped away wednesday leaving 31 
hostages to stumble from a kuwaiti jumbo jet that was a prison of 
fear brutality and death for 15 days 
the shiite moslem gunmen had murdered two passengers since 
hijacking the kuwait airways flight 422 with 112 people aboard on 
april 5 between bangkok and the persian gulf sheikdom 
they agreed to free their remaining hostages after arranging 
safe passage with algerian officials who mediated a settlement the 
hijackers had demanded that kuwait free 17 proiranians convicted 
and imprisoned for bombing the us and french embassies in 
december 1983 
among the passengers on the boeing 747 were three cousins of the 
kuwaiti ruler sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
kuwaits official news agency kuna citing algerian sources it 
did not identify said five hijackers left the plane then about 
10 minutes later four other pirates left the plane following that 
the hostages came out at 6 am three hours into the 16th day 
of the hijacking the number of hijackers had previously been 
estimated at seven or eight 
according to the agency the hijackers were assured safe passage 
to either beirut or tehran 
nbc news reported wednesday that us officials believe the 
algerians provided the hijackers with letters or tapes from the 17 
prisoners in kuwait so friends and relatives could see the 
prisoners had not been harmed 
a us official in washington said efforts were made during the 
algerian negotiations to assure the hijackers the 17 were not being 
mistreated the official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it was not known if the algerians gave the hijackers letters or 
tapes 
a sovietbuilt transport plane belonging to the algerian air 
force took off shortly before dawn it is rare for military 
aircraft to use the civilian houari boumedienne airport and there 
was speculation some or all the hijackers were aboard 
algerian officials would not discuss the flight or its 
occupants kuna quoted mohammed taher a member of the algerian 
negotiating team as saying without elaboration that the hijackers 
were still here 
interior minister hedi khediri who led the algerian mediators 
announced the dramas end without giving details and said the fate 
of the hijackers was the concern of algeria alone 
floodlights had bathed the blueandwhite jet nightly since it 
landed in the north african capital on april 13 but were 
extinguished at 9 pm tuesday they never came back on making it 
difficult for reporters to detect movement in the area 
after the plane was seized over the indian ocean it was 
diverted to mashhad iran where the terrorists released 57 
hostages freed passengers said they believed more gunmen boarded 
at mashhad with submachine guns and dynamite that was wired to the 
planes doors later 
after three days in mashhad the hijackers tried to take the 
plane to beirut but the airport there would not permit it to land 
the jet ran low on fuel and larnaca cyprus agreed to accept it 
during five days in larnaca the hijackers beat two kuwaiti 
security men shot them to death and dumped their bodies from the 
aircraft they let 13 more hostages go in exchange for fuel which 
brought them to algiers 
the hostages trembled as they emerged from the plane in the 
darkness wednesday morning 
first to descend were anware and ibtesam alsabah second 
cousins of the kuwaiti emir and the only two women left aboard the 
women wore thick black veils 
they were taken to an algiers clinic in an ambulance with their 
brother fadel khaled alsabah who suffered from a nervous 
disorder a doctor said 
algerian authorities said none of the three was hurt 
tadar elkebi a 31yearold businessman said he saw the 
hijackers going through the plane trying to wipe out their 
fingerprints at about 4 am the first indication i had that our 
release was imminent 
abdel monem mahmoud an egyptian who was the planes purser 
said the worst time was when they put a gun to the head of one of 
the passengers their eyes behind their masks were sharp and 
expressionless like those of a shark 
the algerian negotiators did not indicate what persuaded the 
hijackers to abandon their effort the kuwaiti news agency said the 
crisis ended without any deal but there were reports that 
kuwait agreed to commute the sentences of the three men among the 
17 who have been sentenced to death 
a kuwaiti official in algiers speaking on condition of 
anonymity noted that the death sentences had not been carried out 
he said he believed an understanding with the emir may have been 
achieved that would result in the sentences being commuted to life 
in prison 
half an hour before the passengers appeared in the planes 
firstclass doorway interior minister khediri broadcast a 
statement that algerian mediation has helped to find a solution 
to all questions linked to the hijacking of the kuwaiti plane 
he said giving no details that a deal was worked out with 
kuwait and any attempt by third parties to obstruct it would be 
counterproductive 
the warning appeared to be aimed at foreign governments 
including the united states 
washington has said consistently that hijackers should not go 
free

a man who unsuccessfully challenged the mass internment of 
japaneseamericans during world war ii said wednesdays senate 
approval of reparations represented a rare opportunity to right an 
old wrong 
the senate approved a bill wednesday calling for the government 
to apologize for the mass roundups and making each of the estimated 
60000 survivors eligible for 20000 payments the house passed a 
similar bill 
about 120000 japaneseamericans were forced to give up their 
homes and businesses and were put in internment camps after japan 
attacked pearl harbor hawaii on dec 7 1941 
the country doesnt have too many opportunities to redress 
something gordon hirabayashi said in a telephone interview from 
edmonton canada 
when it does i think we should take that opportunity and look 
to the future to keep the honor of our country inviolable i think 
that result would be the finishing touch to what the 
japaneseamericans hope that their tragedy will contribute to 
hirabayashi then a 23yearold student in seattle was arrested 
in 1942 after refusing to abide by an 8 pmto6 am curfew or 
report to a civilian control center the first step toward 
placement in an internment camp 
constitutional challenges by him and two other 
japaneseamericans to the internment orders resulted in supreme 
court rulings in 1943 and 1944 upholding the relocation as an 
emergency military measure 
last september the 9th us circuit court of appeals wiped 
hirabayashis convictions off the books ruling that the government 
had suppressed evidence that the mass imprisonment was ordered for 
racial rather than military reasons 
the government has not appealed the ruling but hirabayashi said 
his lawyers have asked the supreme court to take up the case anyway 
so the high courts previous decision can be removed from the 
records 
in seattle cherry kinoshita rejoiced in the senate vote 46 
years after she was uprooted from her home and sent to a camp in 
idaho 
pleased would be an understatement she said weve been 
working for over 10 years to see this happen i think its great to 
see our nation admit an error and take steps to remedy what was a 
great injustice 
ms kinoshita who was 18 when she went with her family to the 
camp at minidoka idaho was one of many japaneseamericans who 
worked to convince the government that internment defied the 
constitution and was a racist 
we hope this will acknowledge that this was a tragic travesty 
of justice and that with this legislation we can hope that it will 
never ever recur again to another group she said 
sam shoji 62 of seattle a social worker for the veterans 
administration who was incarcerated for 13 months said the money 
was only a token but at least it is there 
it was basically a concentration camp said shoji 
the issue took a long time to be resolved because of the shame 
the japaneseamericans felt at being locked up and the federal 
governments willingness to bury the matter hirabayashi said 
in this case the victims were so traumatized by this 
experience that they had not recovered enough to talk about until a 
decade or so ago he said 
there was nothing in the history books he said now the 
situation is different we have to take some kind of historical 
perspective on this forty years is not all that long

gary harts former press secretary says he 
told two lies both last may when the candidates white house bid 
was collapsing 
kevin sweeney made the admission in a review in wednesdays san 
francisco examiner of speaking out inside the reagan white 
house by larry speakes the former white house spokesman who 
admitted fabricating quotes for reagan 
i told two lies both last may when harts original 1988 
campaign crumbled to its apparent end wrote sweeney 
sweeney harts press secretary from 1985 to may 1987 when hart 
temporarily pulled out of the race for the democratic presidential 
nomination said he lied when he told a washington post reporter 
that hart was asleep 
i was trying to buy time after being told yet another 
potentially fatal revelation he said 
he said he lied again when he emphatically denied to an abc 
reporter who called at 4 am that harts campaign was about to end 
i was trying to protect the harts privacy as they left for 
home he said 
sweeney who lives in san bruno south of san francisco said 
that because the campaign was ending he no longer cared about his 
credibility 
he added that during his tenure he also told tiny lies on 
those occasions when he said he thought hart had done well when he 
in fact he hadnt 
my substantive lies i regret my subjective lies i do not 
said sweeney but since my first day as press secretary the 
steps away from the absolute truth be they small or large 
constantly presented themselves as the single greatest ethical 
dilemma in my life 
frankly most press secretaries are liars he said 
speakes in his book admitted twice attributing to reagan 
quotes he never made 
in once instance he quoted reagan as telling soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev during the 1985 summit there is much that 
divides us but i believe the world breathes easier because we are 
talking here together

israel mourned its war dead wednesday and then 
after sundown celebrated its 40th birthday with a military show 
barbecues and dancing in the streets 
memorial day during which israelis honor the 16450 soldiers 
killed in seven wars and in clashes with arab guerrillas ran from 
sundown tuesday until sundown wednesday followed by the 24hour 
independence day celebration 
festivities this year were tempered by anxiety over more than 
four months of arab rebellion in the occupied lands 
authorities suspended travel to israel by the 15 million 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip through the 
weekend to prevent terrorist attacks 
in a special independence day message aimed at an arab audience 
president chaim herzog called on palestinians to end antiisraeli 
protests and said they were being misled by leaders making 
unrealistic promises 
the hope of the palestinians does not lie in the hapless 
attempt to defeat israel but in acceptance compromise and 
coexistence he said his remarks read in hebrew but peppered 
with arabic phrases were broadcast on israels arabiclanguage 
television 
in a separate address aimed at a jewish audience herzog 
emphasized israels achievements adding that the clouds which 
overcast israels skies in the 40th year of its independence are 
passing clouds 
israel gained its independence on may 14 1948 and the 
celebration wednesday coincided with the date on the hebrew 
calendar 
mourning and celebration are coupled each year so that our 
children are aware of the sacrifice that went behind the joy of our 
independence teacher ruth dafnai told a reporter as her sixth 
graders put flowers on graves at the mount herzl cemetery in 
jerusalem 
israeli leaders planned many festivities for the 40th 
anniversary with a nostalgic theme 
hikes were scheduled for thursday along routes taken by 
prestate jewish fighters israels declaration of independence is 
on display at the parliament building 
a highlight of the holiday wednesday evening was the nations 
first mass public display of armaments since a military parade in 
1973 it included parachute jumps fighter jets tanks and 
fireworks 
israel has avoided displaying its military might in the past 
preferring not to emphasize the role of wars in its short history 
teachers say independence and memorial day ceremonies at schools 
help prepare children for military duty 
army service is a central part of life in israel where 
18yearold jewish men serve three years of compulsory duty 
followed by at least 40 days a year in the reserves until age 54 
at denmark high school in jerusalem bereaved parents lectured 
in classrooms wednesday and pupils saluted those killed in combat 
and in training accidents 
cyrus weiler 81 who immigrated from the soviet union 25 years 
ago and has lost two sons in battle urged 50 high school juniors 
to learn from his childrens example of sacrifice 
everyone has to defend our homeland he said if you 
continue in this path of helping the country there will be value 
to your life 
weilers son adam was killed in 1970 during a battle with 
egyptians at the suez canal and gideon was slain in a golan 
heights tank battle with syrians during the 1973 arabisraeli war 
prime minister yitzhak shamir and yitzhak rabin the defense 
minister delivered memorial day speeches in jerusalem and tel aviv 
we are facing one long war rabin said in order to live 
here as a people and a state we must be strong and ready to defend 
ourselves we know that the first time we lose a war it will be 
our last 
shamir said at another ceremony that we reiterate our 
determination to defend our homeland and told a group of 
american jewish fundraisers the palestinian uprising is not 
demonstrations or sitins it is war 
of soldiers who serve in the occupied territories the prime 
minister said i can tell that they know that what they are doing 
now is just as important for the countrys future as anything they 
have done in the past and were just as proud of them now as we 
were then

mysterious girl in a polka dot dress running from the scene of 
robert f kennedys assassination admitted two weeks later that she 
lied according to newly released files 
sandra serrano a college student at the time said she had 
confronted the woman on the night of kennedys shooting at the 
ambassador hotel in los angeles just after midnight june 5 1968

the ambassador hotel for a reenactment the file showed but on 
june 20 1968 when told she had failed a liedetector test she 
declared the whole thing was a lie 
asked by police sgt enrique hernandez why she had not corrected 
the story sooner she said i didnt want to look like a fool 
which i look like now you know i thought i was supposed to see 
more more than i did 
the following day june 21 police canceled an allpoints 
bulletin for the girl in the polkadot dress but the story did not 
die 
when the kennedy files were released tuesday among the items on 
display in a glass case was a black and white polka dot dress

the general assembly voted wednesday 
to revoke a state of emergency imposed a month ago after an 
abortive coup against the countrys de facto ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
the move was announced in a local television broadcast which 
said the assembly had acted at the request of civilian president 
manuel solis palma 
there was no immediate comment from the government 
technically called a state of urgency by panamas 
constitution the action permitted the government to suspend a wide 
range of civil liberties including freedom of speech and assembly 
and the right to private property 
the government invoked the decree on march 18 two days after 
dissident officers tried to remove noriega as head of panamas 
defense forces 
earlier wednesday a us official said that four highranking 
panamanian military officers will attend a seminar at fort mcnair 
near washington next week 
the official who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
said the four would participate in a course at the interamerican 
defense college 
the seminar will bring together officers from several member 
nations of the organization of amrican states including those from 
panama 
the reagan administration has been using economic pressure to 
try to force the ouster of noriega head of panamas defense 
forces it has let it be known it would welcome a coup by junior 
officers 
the panamanians attending the seminar were identified as col 
elias castillo a ranking member of the defense forces col julio 
ow young the nations police chief and majs daniel delgado 
diamante and arosemena king 
delgado is a specialist on the panama canal treaty and king is 
the no 2 man in military intelligence all four are based at 
defense forces headquarters in panama city 
the 15000member defense forces includes the military and 
police 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges which he has denied 
ranking members of noriegas staff are said to be seldom 
accessible to us diplomats the military officers thus may be 
sought out by pentagon officials upon their arrival at fort mcnair 
the us official who described the trip said he did not know 
when the four would arrive in the united states or how long they 
would be attending the seminar

among the the flowers palms and deepblue 
waters of hawaii a widely esteemed native minister the rev 
abraham k akaka bears a message of the ukulele for islanders 
and the world 
to the states singularly mixed culture of races traditions and 
ancestry he advises think of yourselves as strings on a 
ukulele each different from the other strings each preserving its 
own tone yet all necessary to make that beautiful harmony 
the objective he said in a telephone interview is unity in 
diversity of maintaining valued differences to enrich the whole 
something hawaii particularly manifests and the world needs 
the key to it is that all the strings all the races nations 
and cultures of mankind need to be tuned to one tuner god whose 
name is love akaka said when they do that they retain their 
individuality but in a way that accepts the other strings in 
unity and harmony 
akaka 71 pastor emeritus of hawaiis oldest church the 
kawaiahao church in downtown honolulu and among few clergymen of 
original hawaiian descent strums the ukulele himself 
he also has a special formula for diversified mutuality 
its a gentle revision of albert einsteins famous formula 
energy equals mass times the speed of light squared by which the 
first atomic chain reaction was achieved in 1942 while akaka was in 
seminary in chicago 
for different purposes he proposes his own formula cm 
creative mutuality squared equals p prosperous peace 
it holds great hope for the future of mankind he said if 
foreign policies of all nations used the formula if every family 
used it every corporation and government used it it would change 
the world 
akaka for 28 years led the 1000member kawaiahao church built 
in the 1830s of creamcolored coral from island reefs its 
americas only church with royal pews for hawaiis onetime 
monarchy he retired in 1985 
but he keeps busy speaking leading weddings and funerals 
blessing new homes stores and other buildings gifts for his 
services go to a foundation for native hawaiian scholarships and to 
help the needy 
you cannot retire from the lord he said 
more than a third of hawaiis million people are christians 
protestants and roman catholics including most caucasians and the 
native minority while nearly a third are buddhist the rest 
shintoists or other faiths 
we do not have religious strife akaka said 
a clergyman of the united church of christ he said the 
different religious groups have become more and more cooperative 
in dealing with issues affecting the wellbeing of the people 
he called modern mass communications media an instrument of 
god binding people closer life with life nation with nation 
culture with culture race with race enabling them to learn about 
each other and understand each other 
that multicultural quality characterizes hawaii where 245 
percent of the population is caucasian 23 percent is of japanese 
ancestry 20 percent is hawaiian and parthawaiian 11 percent 
filipino and smaller numbers of chinese koreans samoans and 
blacks 
native hawaiians such as akaka are descended from polynesians 
who came in large canoes from legendary hawaiki believed to be 
marquesas island to the west as long as 2000 years ago 
a second wave came from tahiti around ad 1000 the hawaiians 
lived in isolation from the world until a british naval officer 
capt james cook came on the lovely isles in 1778 
the native religion was polytheistic with idols to many gods 
and goddesses after the monarchy developed queen kaahumanu in 
1819 abolished the native religion 
the gap soon was filled by protestant missionaries first sent 
in 1820 by congregationalist antecedants of akakas present 
denomination 
they set up schools and churches learned the hawaiian language 
putting it into writing for the first time introduced democratic 
principles roman catholic missionaries came in 1827 natives 
overwhelmingly became christians 
akaka said that unlike cases in which invading western 
civiliation overturned and sometimes destroyed native cultures 
the hawaiian people were pretty fortunate large credit is due to 
work of the missionaries 
much of our culture and history was preserved and 
perpetuated akaka said we are americans today we love our 
country love the united states but like any other people we 
love our roots 
noting the names of the main old gods wakea and papa 
mean space and place arms that embrace all humanity he added 
that is the meaning of aloha the name that the people chose 
for our state the aloha state it emphasizes love for all people 
aloha means we love you care for you welcome you it expresses 
that we are a family belonging to each other

when the 100foot pride of baltimore ii is 
launched april 30 nearly two years will have passed since its 
namesake and four crewmembers disappeared in a flash of high wind 
and rain called a white squall 
after the sinking 240 miles north of puerto rico the operators 
of the clipperschooner weathered a critical report by federal 
safety investigators and the city debated whether to chance the sea 
again in a second pride 
the eight survivors of the sinking who spent nearly five days 
in a partially inflated life raft ankledeep in sea water urged 
continuance of the prides mission of good will and promotion of 
baltimore and maryland 
so far the state has contributed 1 million and the city 
500000 toward the 45 million cost of creating a new safer 
ship an additional 200000 has come from individuals whose 
outpouring of sympathy and enthusiasm for the pride ultimately 
impelled the decision to rebuild 
in its voyages around the united states and abroad the first 
pride provided economic development officials with a lure for 
businesses and drew attention to the inner harbor baltimores 
waterfront showpiece of urban revitalization 
boston has its nonprofit spirit of massachusetts and 
california has a boat called the californian operated by a 
nonprofit group that primarily offers sailing lessons 
still said gail shawe executive director of the pride of 
baltimore inc the private nonprofit corporation that is 
building and will operate the ship the pride really was the only 
vessel built with public dollars owned by the public and used for 
a goodwill mission tied to economic development 
her office is decorated with photographs of the original pride 
sailing past a danish castle and under the tower bridge in london 
the inner harbor has echoed with the hammer blows of 16 
shipwrights as the longer wider and more stable pride ii has taken 
shape 
peter boudreau one of the prides rotating captains and builder 
of the new clipper is eager for it to move beyond the sad shadow 
of its predecessor 
its not intentionally callous im sure everybody has their 
private thoughts said boudreau 33 who was building another 
ship may 18 1986 when he listened in disbelief to news that the 
pride and four of his colleagues were lost you really want to 
get on with things do what you do best 
the shipbuilders who have placed five good luck horseshoes 
around the hull and their workshops are putting final touches on 
the ship hammering cotton and oakum threads into the hull seams 
with mallets and chisels 
following a computeraided design theyve turned nearly 100 
tons of central american hardwoods and douglas fir from the pacific 
northwest into masts deck hull and interior 
william a beasman chairman of the pride of baltimore inc 
praised the workmanship 
the artistry and skill in the keel the knees theyre 
absolutely works of art he said when its covered over you 
dont see that work theres not a boat built in the united states 
that can match the quality of that work 
in designing the pride ii naval architect thomas c gillmer 
carried on the sleek look and advanced rigging design of the 
baltimore clipperschooners the first wholly americandesigned 
vessels for port arrivals departures and special occasions the 
ship will fire sixpound cannons and swivel guns like those carried 
by chesapeake bay clippers that ran british blockades in the war of 
1812 
unlike the first pride the new ship has been fitted with a 
second diesel motor coast guard regulations mandate that as a 
passengercarrying vessel the new ship must contain watertight 
bulkheads which werent required on its predecessor their absence 
contributed to the prides rapid flooding after it tipped in the 
fierce wind according to the coast guard 
pride ii is 92 feet long at waterline compared with 76 feet on 
the original and 3 feet wider at the beam its heavier too 
displacing 185 tons compared to the original ships 123 its 
going to take more wind to make this boat keel over that far 
said boudreau 
two years before the sinking a coast guardcommissioned study 
determined the ship was unstable and prone to tip the study said 
the pride would lose stability once it tipped more than 30 degrees 
from upright would begin to flood at 53 degrees and would not be 
able to right itself once it reached 76 degrees 
the squall knocked the pride on its side within 20 seconds and 
it sank within 2 minutes crew members said 
after the 1986 tragedy ms shawe said board members shied from 
a replacement project as they coped with guilt a sense of 
responsibility it was our decision that put that boat out there 
and four people lost their lives 
when the decision to rebuild was made safety was the top 
consideration she said 
in a report on the sinking the national transportation safety 
board criticized the pride organization for sailing an uninspected 
vessel 
we werent trying to sneak into some loophole they the coast 
guard had no reason to inspect the boat ms shawe said 
explaining that only ships that carry passengers or cargo must 
undergo coast guard inspection 
she defends the pride captain crew and board for taking care 
about safety on their own 
the two captains and i spent hours talking about the risks 
what should the communication schedule be the old ship had 
everything we could put on it 
what we could have done differently were the epirbs she 
said referring to a decision to equip the ship with manually 
activated emergency radio signals rather than automatic signals 
that can be tripped simply by water on the deck epirb stands for 
emergency position indicating radio beacon 
the pride ii is fitted with automatic devices 
when a bethlehem steel floating crane hoists the pride of 
baltimore ii into the inner harbor the ship still will be months 
from commissioning thats tentatively scheduled for late october 
when the ship begins her maiden voyage 
the new pride may venture to new ports in the far east or south 
america and is expected to take its place in the 1992 new york 
parade of tall ships marking 500 years since columbus discovered 
america 
at a gathering of such ships for the statue of liberty 
celebration july 4 1986 less than seven weeks after the sinking 
the spirit of massachusetts towed a dinghy filled with flowers 
donated by one of the prides massachusetts ports of call in memory 
of the pride crew

tess harpers incredibly blue eyes flash when 
she talks about abcs little girl lost in which she plays a 
foster mother battling an insensitive bureaucracy to save a 
sexually molested child 
harper and frederic forrest play clara and tim brady who love 
the young girl placed in their care but see her wrenched away even 
though they complain the natural father is abusing the child 
when the child tells us shes been abused the social services 
caseworker doesnt believe her said harper then a newly 
elected judge takes her away from us and awards her to the father 
were told we have no rights because foster parents are only paid 
baby sitters 
the twohour movie filmed in texas is based on a true story 
it was brought to the screen by executive producer marian rees who 
won an emmy for love is never silent abc will show the movie 
monday 
patricia kalember costars as a tv reporter who supports the 
bradys in their quest to regain custody of the child marie martin 
plays the child tella debusk who is nicknamed beans 
its getting to where the word of children is being taken more 
seriously in court but at the time of our story in the 1970s the 
word of a child wasnt taken seriously said harper 
its amazing how much children are regarded as property to a 
large degree the legal system treats children as property they 
have no civil rights 
harper said that even after physical proof of molestation was 
found social service officials declined to prosecute the father 
instead they forced him to give up custody of the child 
she said tella was placed with another foster family they 
wouldnt return her to us and they wouldnt let us adopt her we 
had bucked the system and had embarrassed them it was all 
vindictive pettiness thats when the fight really began 
the social services workers argued that the bradys only foster 
parents had become emotionally involved 
throwing up her hands in bewilderment harper said how can 
you take a child into your home and not become emotionally 
involved you become emotionally involved with a pet its part of 
nurturing and raising a child 
the bradys eventually got tella back but a trailer at the end 
says the child they got back was not the same child that had 
been taken away 
her trust had been violated said harper 
the movie was filmed in the same area as tender mercies 
harpers first film she had been working in regional theater in 
texas when she was cast by australian director bruce beresford as 
the young widow who becomes the salvation of a downandout 
countrywestern singer played by robert duvall who won an oscar 
harper was nominated for an academy award for her supporting 
role as the obnoxious cousin of sisters jessica lange sissy spacek 
and diane keaton in crimes of the heart 
before doing little girl lost harper was in minnesota again 
costarring with lange in far north written and directed by 
langes companion playwright and actor sam shepard charles 
durning and anne wedgeworth also star 
all sam will let us say is that its about a family in the 
north woods she said i can say its good and im proud of 
it 
she also has another movie coming out criminal law with 
kevin bacon and gary oldman she plays a police detective a role 
originally written for a man 
i did three pictures last year she said i left in july 
and came back in december then i painted my house

as interest rates have edged upward in recent 
weeks many savers and investors have begun looking for ways to 
avoid the same mistakes they made last spring 
yields on longterm treasury bonds one closely watched gauge of 
overall trends in interest rates have climbed lately from about 
83 percent to just above 9 percent as of early this week 
wall street is filled with talk that the federal reserve might 
soon tighten credit further in order to keep an unexpectedly 
strong economy from touching off increased inflationary pressures 
all this carries a familiar ring for people who remember what 
happened in late march through may 1987 when a surge in interest 
rates sent values of many longterm interestbearing investments 
for example bond mutual funds tumbling by 10 percent to 15 
percent 
forecasting interest rates is a notoriously difficult task when 
the great majority of people expect them to rise they are 
perfectly capable of doing just the opposite 
still for anyone for wants to avoid getting caught in an 
exposed position should rates keep moving up there is a wide 
variety of choices available 
the key to reducing interestrate risk is to shorten maturities 
that is to move into investments with lives short enough that 
their market values arent much affected by changing conditions 
reg green publisher of the mutual fund news service recently 
provided the example of a threeyear government note yielding 
about 74 percent it would rise or fall in value by about 25 
percent for each decline or increase of one percentage point in 
longterm interest rates 
by contrast a 15year treasury bond yielding about 87 percent 
would fluctuate about 10 percent in value if longterm rates rose 
or fell one percentage point 
if you want to eliminate any ups and downs whatsoever in the 
dollar value of your principal you can opt for very shortterm 
investments that are collectively referred to in the investment 
business as cash 
these include treasury bills available in maturities of three 
months to one year money market mutual funds whose total assets 
have lately hit record highs and bank money market accounts or 
certificates of deposit maturing in say three to six months 
should interest rates rise substantially at any point yields on 
money market funds would naturally follow them with a lag time 
that depends on the average maturity of the securities in the 
funds portfolio 
a popular new breed of money funds invests in shortterm 
municipal securities and thus provides income that is exempt from 
federal income taxes 
but their appeal might not be as great as it looks suppose you 
are faced with the choice of a taxable money fund yielding 643 
percent and a taxfree fund returning 458 percent 
if you are in the 33 percent tax bracket which applies this 
year to a relatively small number of higherincome savers and 
investors you would come out with a slightly higher after 
taxreturn in the taxfree fund 
but if you were in the 28 percent bracket you would actually 
realize a few more aftertax dollars with your money in the taxable 
fund than in the taxfree one 
suppose you are chary of the longterm bond market but not 
satisfied with yields available in the money markets there are 
plenty of ways to compromise with an investment maturing in the 
medium term or somewhere roughly 18 months to 10 years from 
now 
options in this range include bank cds treasury securities 
bought directly from the government or through a bank or broker 
and limited maturity bond mutual funds

the elevator goes up but never comes down the 
higher it gets the faster it goes there is no stop button 
the situation recalls the hairraising serials that once were a 
staple of early movie houses in which each sequence ended in awful 
peril followed in a week by impossible escape 
but there may be no escape from this difficulty unless the 
corporations involved are even more creative than directors of 
those old movies and certainly more ingenious they have been to 
date 
the subject is the total income both salary and bonus of top 
corporate officers only a couple of decades ago it was measured in 
the low six figures more recently in seven digits and now on 
occassion in eight numbers 
one of the problems is that executive bonuses general motors 
granted 157 million in stock bonuses last year are almost always 
based on good shortterm performance 
the situation can reach an acute stage when the industry is 
cyclical which the automotive industry is that is years of big 
sales high profits rising stock prices and the like alternate 
with off years 
there is rarely a price to be paid for off years but there is 
almost always a reward to be gained for good years 
professor eugene jennings professor of business at michigan 
state university and a confidential adviser to corporate chiefs and 
boards says the everrising incomes are developing into a public 
relations problem for companies 
in lean years he observes some executives are given bonuses 
based on the justification that money will motivate them to produce 
fat years when the fat years arrive their bonuses are justified as 
in the interests of equity 
equity in this instance means it is fair that executives be 
compensated for enhancing shareholder values but when that and 
other explanations cannot be made it is sometimes argued that 
bonuses are needed to retain valued people 
when those reasons fail market parity is used it means that an 
executive of one company certainly cannot be compensated lower than 
that of a comparable executive in a similar company it is said 
that market wages must be paid 
there is some evidence that in lean years boards do indeed grant 
fewer or smaller salary and bonus increases 
but says jennings as soon as one of these justifications can 
be made increases in bonuses occur of such proportion as to make 
up for ground lost in the lean years 
he is convinced that if there were no lean years total incomes 
would be smaller but he observes lean years set the foundation 
for subsequent large bonuses 
he maintains there is no doubt in my mind and in minds of many 
chief executives i have advised that you could pay onehalf the 
salaries and bonuses that america pays to corporate officers and 
still get competent management 
the problem is that no one company can make the cuts and 
survive it has to be across the board and that might mean a 
national conference of chiefs to decide on controls a prospect he 
does not think will take place 
illustrating the difficulty in making changes general motors 
last year announced that future bonuses would be tied to longterm 
performance one year later it contradicted itself announcing big 
shortterm bonuses 
while growing as a public relations problem he believes the 
rising incomes have not yet reached a critical stage in terms of 
public concern but that they will the totals will grow swiftly as 
the amounts involved are compounded 
and no one company he says has access to the stop button

the campaign for frances presidential election has 
boiled down to a twoway contest president francois mitterrand 
the socialist turned centrist against premier jacques chirac a 
smoothedover conservative banking on his record 
seven other candidates are running in the first round of the 
election sunday but none appear to have a realistic chance of 
making it to the runoff may 8 between the top two votegetters 
with polls indicating the 71yearold mitterrand will easily win 
the first round the contest likely to gain most attention is that 
between chirac 55 and another conservative former premier 
raymond barre 64 for second place and a trip to the runoff 
the wildcard is jeanmarie le pen leader of the extreme right 
national front whose score may upset predictions 
all have appealed to the center in their campaigns 
abandoning most of his socialist rhetoric mitterrand says that 
if he wins a second sevenyear term he will try to form a new 
presidential majority in the present conservative national 
assembly to do that he would have to win over wavering 
centerright deputies otherwise he says he will dissolve the 
national assembly and call new legislative elections 
chirac says he too will keep the present national assembly 
where he has a slim threeseat majority but would ask his new 
premier to enlarge the cabinet to encompass more of the center 
polls indicate the french have grown weary of the ideological 
rightleft wrangling that has characterized politics since charles 
de gaulle established the fifth republic 30 years ago 
many are satisfied with the current cohabitation of a 
leftist president mitterrand and rightist premier chirac 
created by the rights victory in the 1986 parlimentary elections 
the polls indicate mitterrand will defeat either chirac or barre 
in the runoff may 8 although his margin of victory has shrunk from 
as much as 10 percent to as little as 4 percent depending on the 
poll 
one survey indicated 52 percent of the voters would like to see 
some of the current rightist leaders take part in a mitterrand 
government and 63 percent feel that socialists should participate 
in a chirac or barre cabinet 
the candidates seem to be listening 
former foreign minister roland dumas a socialist and friend of 
the president said recently the election is going to 
redistribute the whole political landscape its like the 
shakespeare play macbeth the trees are going to move 
on issues however indications are that few voters expect any 
startling changes no matter who wins 
in laying out his platform mitterrand proposed only two 
concrete ideas reimposing the wealth tax and reducing the 
presidential term to five years 
the wealth tax affecting frances 100000 richest people is an 
old idea promulgated by the socialists in 1981 and repealed by the 
conservatives in 1986 the fiveyear term was floated by former 
president valery giscard destaing last year it incited little 
enthusiam on the right or left 
mitterrand who has carefully nurture an image as the wise 
grandfather above the daily political slogging stuck to 
generalities in his short campaign his objectives in domestic 
policy focus on modernizing business and agriculture to make them 
more competitive and to giving priority to education professional 
training and research his foreign policy objectives aim at what he 
calls the construction of europe and reducing the gap that 
separates rich and poor countries 
chirac who is president of the neogaullist rally for the 
republic also focuses on economic themes and tries to stick the 
socialist label firmly on mitterrands back 
from 1981 until 1986 under the empire of the socialists our 
country fell five years behind chirac said during the campaign 
make no mistake socialism today even if it doesnt want to use 
the name is not any the less dangerous 
barre an economics professor likes to stress that he is a 
member of no political party though he is supported by the 
centerright union for french democracy a part of chiracs 
governing coalition 
of all the candidates he has proposed the most detailed 
program a 23billion plan for measures that would include 
strengthening education fiscal reform investment aid to help 
create jobs and a guaranteed income for the unemployed he is vague 
on where the money will come from 
then there is the 59yearold le pen vilified by all political 
leaders but nonetheless representing 10 to 12 percent of the vote 
the left is contending that the right cannot win the election 
without support from national front voters backing le pen who has 
campaigned on a franceforthefrench theme and has railed against 
immigrants particularly arabs from north africa 
chirac does indeed need national front votes but has repeatedly 
vowed he will never work a deal with le pen for his votes in the 
runoff the premiers chances depend very much on how much of the 
extreme right vote he can collect in the second round and how many 
of barres firstround voters he can entice 
some of le pens supporters are disgruntled communists unhappy 
with their partys proimmigrant stand analysts say many of them 
will return to their natural leftist camp in the runoff or 
abstain they also predict that about a third of barres centrist 
supporters could end up in the mitterrand column on may 8 
among the others on the ballot is andre lajoinie 58 the 
official candidate of the communist party which once was a power 
on the left representing nearly a quarter of the vote but now has 
fallen on hard times 
adding to the communists woes is the candidacy of pierre juquin 
58 expelled from the party last year after assailing what he 
called the partys archaic structure and demanding party reform 
at the bottom are antoine waechter 39 an ecologist candidate 
seeking to increase voter awareness about the environment arlette 
laguiller 48 a trotskyist making her third race and pierre 
boussel 67 another trotskyist

run for the presidency defeating valery giscard destaing the 
incumbent conservative his victory was followed by a socialist 
sweep in national assembly elections the same year after series of 
costly spending measures early in his tenure mitterrand and his 
socialists reversed themselves and instituted austerity the result 
was a dropoff in mitterrands popularity from 60 percent early in 
his term to 27 percent at midterm he has since moved from the 
left to centerleft distancing himself from his party and is 
perceived by many to be above daytoday politics a lifelong 
politician mitterrand was first elected to the national assembly 
in 1946 and held 11 ministerial posts until 1958 he founded the 
modern socialist party in 1971

the biggest complaint i had were the electrical problems the 
right rear window power of course wouldnt go down on the test 
car 
also the electrical cutoff to the rear seats designed so 
drivers can keep youngsters in the back from playing with the power 
windows and power rear seats that recline didnt work 
still those problems even in a 26000 car were quickly 
forgotten once the scorpio was put in gear and began to move 
handling was flawlesss so much so that at one point i was up to 
120 mph without realizing it 
even at that high speed this reardrive luxury touring sedan 
with firm taut suspension handled as if it was only going 6065 
mph in fact keeping the scorpio within speed limits required 
vigilance the car just wanted to run 
it was quickly up to 45 mph in residential areas up to 7580 
mph on highways with equal regularity it just didnt feel as if it 
was going that fast 
electronically controlled antilock brakes performed superbly to 
prevent brake lockup in several simulated panic stops 
i wasnt sure i would like the fourpeed automatic transmission 
i prefer manuals on performance cars but i came to enjoy the 
relatively smooth operation of this automatic 
inside special details were everywhere 
a fuel economy computer that could instantly and constantly 
calculate fuel consumption was a bit distracting and im not sure 
someone paying 26000 for the car would care that much about 
keeping track of some gallons of gasoline 
but the optional leather seats on the test car with lumbar 
support in front made for comfortable rides 
the steering wheel not only tilted by telescoped up and down as 
the driver wished 
map reading lights for front and rear riders could be rotated to 
better focus light where needed 
rear seats as well as front seats reclined 
outside mirrors were heated 
there was even a builtin light on the head of the key so a 
driver could illuminate the keyhole on the outside of the door and 
unlock the vehicle with ease in the dark 
the scorpio certainly is a worthy competitor in its market 
segment which includes the audi 5000 and mercedes 190 and has won 
hearts in europe 
introduced there in may 1985 the west germanbuilt scorpio won 
the prestigious european car of the year award for 1986 and was 
named top car in britain car of the year in ireland and denmark 
and imported car of the year in spain 
since its european debut more than 271000 have been sold 
scorpios sales in this country began last may and road amp track 
magazine named it one of the 10 best cars for value 
in 1987 just over 5000 were sold and ford projects 1988 sales 
of more than 10000 according to a company spokeswoman 
us buyers have average age of 45 and annual income of 65000 
she said seventy percent are college graduates 80 percent are 
married and 30 percent are females 
because of its newness to the us market the scorpio is not 
listed in consumer reports trouble index of frequency of repairs 
however ford has ensured scorpio buyers the car will retain much 
of its value with a program that guarantees tradein price 
the tradein is calculated by comparing the average resale value 
of the car to the average resale value of the mercedes 190e using 
monthly figures from the national automobile dealers associations 
usedcar guide if there is a discrepancy say the scorpios resale 
value is at 45 percent of the original purchase price while the 
average mercedes 190es is at 50 percent the scorpio owner will be 
paid the 5 percent difference

in march premier giovanni goria decided to go ahead with 
completion of the plant which angered italys socialist party and 
helped bring down gorias fiveparty coalition 
in switzerland antinuclear and environmental activists last 
year submitted enough signatures to force two referendums on 
nuclear energy 
one referendum calls for a 10year moratorium on construction of 
new nuclear power plants the second deals with the scrapping of 
the nations five nuclear power plants and on a ban on construction 
of new ones 
the referendums are not expected to come to a vote until at 
least 1990 
since chernobyl nuclear power plant construction has continued 
in several east european countries including east germany poland 
and czechoslovakia 
the accident continues to fuel efforts of antinuclear and 
environmental groups in yugoslavia east germany and poland but 
their numbers remain small and they are often harassed 
east german security forces last year raided the offices of one 
environmental group in east berlin and detained several of its 
members 
but in italy the accident led in effect to the scrapping of 
the nations future nuclear power expansion program 
in november 1987 the italians voted by a margin of 41 to 
reject the further use of nuclear power 
italy operates three nuclear power plants all of which are 
temporarily closed for routine maintenance and reactor refueling a 
fourth is in an advanced state of construction 
but the chernobyl disaster has also fostered more cooperation 
between east and west on nuclear issues 
a soviet delegation visited britain in march and the two nations 
have agreed to exchange safetyrelated information in addition to 
details of any major radiation leaks 
west germany has provided technical safety assistance to east 
germany and last year signed an agreement with the soviet union for 
joint efforts in developing nuclear power 
most european countries continue to test for radiation in 
imported foods blanket bans on foodstuffs were lifted in 1986 
coffee chocolates meats dairy products cereals and baby 
foods are not admitted into the country unless they carry a 
certificate showing theyve been tested for radioactivity said a 
senior greek health ministry official 
arkadiusz zmyslowski director of the polish atomic agency told 
the associated press there were no lingering effects in poland 
related to the accident 
the radiation is back to the normal levels that existed before 
the chernobyl accident he said there is no contamination of 
milk or any food 
on april 15 the soviet news agency tass quoted an agriculture 
official in the ukraine alexei denisenko as saying that crop 
yields there had improved since the accident and that no 
irreparable damage had been done he added that all farm 
products are checked for radiation before they are sold tass said 
but despite widespread testing and assurances that most areas of 
europe were not exposed to serious radiation levels many residents 
remain uneasy and worry about the accidents longterm impact 
eva goes the swedish environmental party activist said 
residents continue to use geiger counters purchased after the 
disaster to test for radiation contamination 
she said the levels are not going down 
concerned parents in wiesbaden west germany also continue to 
run their own radioactivitymeasuring station 
sheep farmer bini jones says the upland section of her 100acre 
farm in north wales is still contaminated but that she needs the 
land for grazing 
everybody said it couldnt happen in the nuclear power 
industry and it did happen and far far away she said we 
worry about the effect on our children and on unborn generations

quick government action after the 
chernobyl nuclear accident two years ago has saved swedens 
reindeer industry and preserved the culture of the lapps who raise 
them officials say 
thanks to government support the industry has remained 
profitable and it has recovered from the shock and depression that 
came to all affected said bengt ekendahl chairman of the 
reindeer radioakgroup formed to help the lapp herdsmen in 
northern sweden 
strong winds carried chernobyls radioactivity 1300 miles to 
the pinewooded wilderness of northern scandinavia where about 
40000 lapps live 
unknown to the reindeer herdsmen the radiation fell in a 
snowfall april 27 1986 the day after the accident affecting 
swathes of central and northern sweden 
later that year about 80 percent of the 95000 reindeer in the 
annual slaughter were discarded because of contamination 
the disaster threatened to destroy the reindeer industry it 
also could have meant the end of the lapp culture which is 
dependant on reindeer farming and which already has been endangered 
by civilization encroaching into forests and grazing land 
many swedes consider reindeer meat a delicacy it is usually 
smoked and has the flavor of wild game for the lapps reindeer 
meat is a staple of their diet and the skins and antlers are used 
for clothing and tools 
the swedish government agreed to pay market prices to the 
farmers for meat that was destroyed and it launched a program to 
find ways to save as many animals as possible 
swedish lapps or samis as they prefer to be called are the 
original nomadic inhabitants of the northern regions of norway 
sweden finland and the soviet kola peninsula collectively called 
lapland 
in sweden they herd about 270000 reindeer some herdsmen still 
roam freely across the scandinavian borders 
reindeer are especially vulnerable to fallout because they eat 
lichen which soaks up high concentrations of radiation 
to counteract the radiation the government distributes free 
pellets of processed food containing bentonite a clay mixed with 
other substances which help reduce the effects of radioactivity 
ekendahl said 
this year the amount of reindeer meat that will have to be 
destroyed is falling to about 35 percent of the 85000 animals due 
to be slaughtered he said 
he estimated that 4000 animals had been saved by lowering the 
radiation levels through the prepared feed and 2500 other 
reindeer were saved for human consumption by moving herds to 
noncontaminated areas 
not one reindeer farmer has had to close down ekendahl said 
he added that the reindeer industry will survive but it will 
face the radiation problem for 20 or 30 more years

after years of hiding afraid the next knock 
on the door could mean deportation thousands of americas illegal 
aliens remain unwilling to come forward to claim the amnesty to 
which they are entitled 
time is running out for those who still have not applied the 
immigration and naturalization services program to legalize 
illegal aliens expires may 4 although measures to extend the 
program are pending in congress it appears none is likely to pass 
before the deadline 
from its implementation in 1987 the ins program has been 
surrounded by rumors lawsuits predictions of failure and general 
distrust from the alien community it seeks to serve 
still more than 16 million people have come forward ins had 
hoped for 2 million of the estimated 3 million total illegal aliens 
in the country 
sofia morgan a clerical worker from manchester jamaica came 
to the united states for a vacation in 1979 and decided to stay to 
make something of herself 
like many illegal aliens the 35yearold harrison ny 
resident worked as a nurses aide and a housekeeper 
when the amnesty program began may 5 1987 morgan hired an 
attorney to ensure her chances i found i really didnt need 
him she said i just happened to have all the documents i 
paid taxes and you have to keep those papers and i found two old 
letters someone had sent me years ago 
at first i was scared that i didnt have all the requirements 
and people would tell you things but i had no trouble at all 
she said 
to other aliens who might be sitting on the fence morgan says 
go ahead and do it its worth the try the good thing is if they 
turn you down they cant deport you if youre turned down you can 
reapply and you can i believe that 
illegal aliens who entered the united states before jan 1 
1982 are eligible for amnesty under the provisions of the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 also eligible are 
agricultural workers who can show they lived in this country for 
least 90 days in the year ended may 1 1986 
the legislation was designed to stem widespread illegal 
immigration by legalizing these workers and penalizing employers 
who continued to hire illegal aliens ins officials told a recent 
senate hearing that illegal border crossings in the southwest had 
dropped by 29 percent in the year the program has been in operation 
as of april 18 12 million aliens had applied for amnesty in 
the regular program and 400111 in the agricultural plan which has 
a nov 30 application deadline an ins spokesman said about 95 
percent of all applications were approved to receive the temporary 
green cards 
to expedite filings in these waning days of the program 
attorney general edwin meese iii issued new regulations allowing 
aliens to apply now and provide paperwork later 
initially aliens had to furnish identification a 185 filing 
fee and proof of their financial status and the length of time 
theyve lived in the united states 
this was a problem because if you have spent the last 10 years 
blending in and avoiding everyone its difficult to produce 
documentation said charlie phee legalization officer at 
georgetown universitys refugee center 
more daunting in many cases was the fear factor 
many of these people have spent years avoiding the ins and to 
ask them to voluntarily go in takes a great leap of faith that some 
are still not ready to make phee said 
ins spokesman duke austin said there was not a single 
element of truth in rumors at the start of the program that 
amnesty actually was a sting operation that would lead to 
deportation of nonqualifying family members 
its been almost a year and we havent done it he said 
this is the proof that weve been responsible and are running the 
program in good faith 
ins has been criticized however for its efforts in educating 
the public about the program 
a report by the carnegie endowment for international peace said 
the public information campaign was seriously inadequate and 
predicted the program would not meet its goal of legalizing at 
least 2 million undocumented workers 
an american bar association report said the programs success 
would depend on the ins finding new ways to reach eligible aliens 
and encoure them to apply before the may 4 deadline 
and an analysis sponsored by the ford foundation found the 
program was so complex it was difficult for the government to 
administer and the applicants to understand this study also said 
the fee was too high 
the ford foundation study did commend the ins however for 
running a largely upbeat program and establishing a network of 
more than 100 legalization officers 
austin says the criticism about public notification isnt 
deserved 
i dont think you can go anywhere in this country and find 
someone who doesnt know about this program he said its 
virtually impossible 
since last june ins has put ads in newpapers answering 
questions aliens might have sponsored musical jingles on the radio 
and placed posters on buses and subways to encourage participation 
phee said one problem was that amnesty information did not 
spread by word of mouth as ins had thought it would 
this is why ins had to have anmesty week and amnesty day 
you know they even had an ins anmesty elephant in the cherry 
blossom parade he said 
but the illegal aliens still were afraid to come forward 
they would stand about 30 feet from your signup table and then 
get closer and closer finally they would ask questions for a 
friend of their mothers cousin he said but it was their own 
situations they asked about it always is 
bills pending on capitol hill would extend the deadline for 
applications but the administration opposes them 
there is no evidence that this would increase the number of 
applications but only reward procrastination austin said and 
the program would in all likelihood become a deficitrunning 
program 
austin said he didnt know what more the government could do 
i dont think anything short of the government going out and 
hauling them in can impact on that he said

in southern california the yearlong program 
for illegal aliens is being hailed as a success by those running it 
and bemoaned as a crippling blow by some industries in constant 
need of cheap labor 
its been an incredible experience and i think very effective 
especially our outreach said harold ezell western region 
commissioner for the immigration and naturalization service 
in march we had everything from amnesty fairs to luaus for 
tongan people weve sacrificed the lives of some 13 or 14 pigs for 
the mission of amnesty 
but the ins program has hurt some businesses in southern 
california particularly the garment industry said garth ward 
president of the garment contractors association of southern 
california inc and president of fashion sportswear inc 
apparel manufacture is californias fifth largest industry and 
the third largest in southern california 
historically weve had an almost unlimited supply of warm 
bodies that were trainable now we have a very limited supply of 
workers ward said 
illegal aliens who can prove they have lived in this country 
continuously since jan 1 1982 have until may 4 to apply for 
amnesty 
the saddest thing about the program is that its going to 
leave a lot of people without any protection whatever said josie 
gonzalez a los angeles immigration attorney 
the vast majority of people in california will remain 
undocumented the principal reason is they entered the country 
too late the second reason is they cant document their 
residence she said 
ward and ms gonzalez said worker shortages within the garment 
industry are the result of several factors 
while as much as 70 percent of the labor pool doesnt qualify 
for amnesty ms gonzalez said those who do qualify often leave 
for other kinds of jobs once they are not afraid of deportation 
they will look around for better jobs 
a year ago i had 140 people i hit a low of 80 and we are 
hiring people with no experience and offering them 4 an hour and 
going to 425 the new state minimum wage and higher in july 
ward said 
ezells region with 36 offices in california arizona nevada 
hawaii and guam is processing 5400 applications a day this month 
compared to 1200 applications a day in december 
these are big numbers were going full bore ezell said 
ezell objects to any extension of the application deadline as 
proposed by congress but ms gonzalez archbishop roger mahony of 
the los angeles roman catholic archdiocese and bernard brown 
president of the coalition of apparel industries in california 
believe more time is needed 
some of the things they are doing at the last minute should 
have been done early on brown said there wasnt enough 
information given to these people a lot of these people dont know 
if they can be documented or not 
mahony argues for a oneyearextension to allow the 
potentially eligible population time to learn of the policy 
adjustments modifications and clarifications that ins has made 
to resolve issues affecting eligibility presently being 
litigated and to give the application population a reasonable 
chance to acquire the proofs necessary and the fees 
but ezell pointed out the program was designed to be 
selffunding we have broken even so far he said can you 
guarantee you can produce 300000 more people for six more months 
or do you think the taxpayers should come up with 30 million or 
40 million more to fund it for another six months 
theres no need for that extension any more than an extension 
on the november elections or filing of income tax 
procrastination is one of the major problems of those who havent 
filed yet he said

antonio gonzalez shined shoes right in 
front of the ins legalization center but for six months he didnt 
bother to follow his customers into the office to apply for amnesty 
gonzalez a 51yearold mexican who has been in the united 
states illegally since 1974 seems to meet the eligibility 
requirement of establishing residency before jan 1 1982 but 
because he worked 12 years for a man who paid him in cash a man 
now dead gonzalez figured he had no way to prove it 
hes typical of the illegal who doesnt know what to do 
said john turner who is helping gonzalez gather affidavits from 
landlords and parttime employers to document his eligibility by 
the may 4 deadline 
about 40000 people have applied for amnesty in el paso fewer 
than the 50000100000 expected but lines have been getting 
longer as the deadline approaches two weeks ago the immigration 
and naturalization service reversed its previous firstcome 
firstserved stance and began asking applicants to make 
appointments the ins is also giving applicants 60 days after the 
deadline to get their documentation in 
in the last few weeks the ins has inserted pamphlets in 
tortilla packages and has sponsored promotions on spanishlanguage 
radio stations in texas and new mexico urging people in their 
native language to apply for amnesty 
but critics say the ins is doing too little too late to attract 
more illegal aliens 
turner manager of national amnesty consultants a company that 
helps illegal aliens assemble their amnesty paperwork echoed other 
critics who assert the ins could have done a better job of 
educating potential applicants 
gonzalez was spurred to action after an el paso heraldpost 
photographer took his picture last month the caption explained 
gonzalezs dilemma and in an accompanying story gonzalez said 
i love america i dream i cross the bridge and proudly say 
american citizen people entering the united states must 
declare their citizenship to ins officials 
turner who works a few doors from the legalization center in 
south el paso saw the photo 
i had seen the guy sitting there for six months selling gum 
and shining shoes turner said one day he asked if i wanted a 
shoeshine and i said no thanks and he said well how about 
helping me with amnesty i said that i can do 
the ins could have better anticipated such problems turner said 
they could have been a lot more practical in their approach to 
education he said they did seminars to spanishspeaking 
audiences in english they issued pamphlets in english and the 
pamphlets are too general 
they amnesty applicants want to know what happens if theyve 
been using their mothers social security number they can still 
get amnesty if theyve been doing that but its not covered in 
any pamphlets and its a common problem 
if you walk into the legalization center and you ask them if 
you had two dwis convictions for driving while intoxicated if you 
could apply they wont answer you they tell you to look somewhere 
else the answer is simple yes if you dont have any felony 
convictions and you have less than three misdemeanor convictions 
father rick matty director of migrant and refugee services for 
the roman catholic diocese of el paso said that because all the 
ins forms are written in english some rejected applicants dont 
know they can appeal and apply again for amnesty 
despite the fact that most applicants in the 13state southern 
ins region speak spanish william chambers director of the 
processing center in dallas said it would be impractical to print 
forms in spanish 
if we did that wed have to print them in about 50 or 60 
languages he said pakistani greek arabic

the sign adjacent to an employment agency in a 
grimy corridor full of job shops reads lava platos and offers 
200 to 250 a week and cuarto comida room and board 
but if you want that dishwashing job you have to have a green 
card the new immigration law is changing the way staffing patterns 
of new york restaurants heretofore heavily dependent on the labor 
of illegal aliens 
if you go to the restaurants always they ask for the card 
said ruben roldan 36 an unemployed shortorder cook and mexican 
immigrant who has been in and out of this country since 1973 
i think its going to be a big problem for people he said 
in a blend of spanish and english as he stood next to the card case 
outside the apollo employment agency one flight up from 
manhattans bustling gritty 14th street 
the apollos manager mike melik leaned against the case and 
eyed a prospective client you have a green card he asked the 
man nodded yes and they disappeared inside 
i have to ask because of the new immigration law requiring 
proof of citizenship or legal residence for all workers melik said 
later 
if the answer is yes we see what kind of job is available 
he said if its no we try to help them to be legal i think 
plenty dont have the card 
under the law employers must be prepared to prove their workers 
live here legally employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens face 
jail terms of up to six months and 10000 fines 
immigration and naturalization service officials say they will 
begin imposing penalties june 1 
the law also provides amnesty to aliens who arrived in the 
united states before 1982 if they apply by may 4 in new york as 
elsewhere the results of the amnesty offer have been 
disappointing officials said 
jack byrnes chief legalization officer for the new york ins 
district said that as of march 25 63000 applications for amnesty 
had been filed officials had expected 300000 applications from 
new york city long island and seven upstate counties 
only 12600 of the applications came from workers in service 
jobs a fraction of the regions illegal restaurant and hotel 
workers that leaves the citys restaurants in a quandary 
one fellow in particular told me if he cant get his help 
legally he may close up shop its very difficult to get americans 
to take these positions said jeffrey margolis an immigration 
lawyer who has run seminars about the law for one of his clients 
the new york state restaurant owners association 
a lot of people said that without juan we couldnt be as 
successful as we are margolis added heres the kind of 
employment that does not require an advanced degree does not 
require fluency in a language and requires someone who will work 
hard for low wages 
albert a worker at world employment who declined to give his 
last name said a lot of people come in here without papers and 
theres no way in the world were going to send them to jobs 
without them 
he said about 25 percent of those seeking jobs lacked documents 
they come from places like senegal south america trinidad and 
jamaica 
five minutes ago i spoke to a spanish guy i had a great job 
for him but he didnt have a social security card or a green 
card albert said he acted disappointed he knows thats the 
law 
attorney ned bassen on the other hand said the two dozen 
members of the restaurant league he represented had reported few 
such problems 
it may be far too early to determine whether restaurants are 
going to have problems and what the impact is going to be bassen 
said its going to take a while before the law is in full 
swing

mary tracey has told about 100 illegal irish 
immigrants that their worries are over an equal number that theirs 
will continue but most of thousands of irish aliens in the boston 
area she never sees 
from her small office at st augustines rectory in south 
boston tracey helps illegal aliens apply for the federal amnesty 
program that ends may 4 the overwhelming majority of the areas 
large illegal irish population wont bother coming 
most of the irish unfortunately are not eligible for the 
amnesty tracey said the irish are not as helped by this as 
are other ethnic groups 
estimates on the number of illegal irish range from 8000 to 
25000 in boston a city of 550000 most immigration officials and 
leaders of the irish community agree that only 2 percent to 3 
percent of the irish qualify for amnesty which is available to 
illegal aliens who entered the united states before jan 1 1982 
the irish have come and gone said charles t cobb district 
director of the immigration and naturalization service they work 
eight or nine months and then go home for a while they never have 
the continuity of illegality that is required to qualify under this 
program most illegal irish are employed in the construction and 
hotelrestaurant industries he said 
an informal network exists among the irish who have jobs and 
they help others who come immigration officials say rarely are 
such rings broken up 
in march a hingham nursing home owner was indicted for 
allegedly inducing 11 irish nationals through ads in a dublin 
newspaper to enter the united states illegally and work for him as 
nursing aides and orderlies 
of the more than 7100 aliens who had applied for amnesty in 
massachusetts as of april 16 only 101 listed ireland as their 
homeland some 30 others said they were from the united kingdom 
which could include residents of britishcontrolled northern 
ireland nationwide about 600 irish aliens have applied out of 
about 15 million applicants 
the low numbers surprise me to some degree said cobb i 
gather that most of the irish have come here after 1982 
bill odonnell editor of the irish echo said his newspaper had 
published scores of articles in the last year explaining the 
amnesty provisions and listing the groups offering assistance to 
prospective applicants last week the newspaper carried an 
editorial demanding that congress extend the deadline 
there just simply has not been enough time on the educational 
end of it to get the word out odonnell said 
rep joseph kennedy dmass has proposed another amnesty 
program for an estimated 150000 illegal irish immigrants who dont 
qualify for the ins program prospects for that proposal as well 
as efforts to extend the deadline are dim 
tracey a social worker for catholic charities meets with 
prospective applicants at least four days a week explaining the 
guidelines and helping with the documentation needed to prove 
residency in the united states prior to 1982 she says that while 
the percentage still is small there has been an increase in 
applications since the first of the year 
cobb concurs 
the procrastinators are coming out of the woodwork he said 
its just like the 14th of april the day before the federal 
income tax deadline 
brendan scannell the irish consul general in boston says that 
the irish who are eligible for amnesty and do not apply will have 
no excuse 
we irish are englishspeaking so we are not placed in the 
same degree of difficulty about entitlement and awareness of the 
package that ins is offering as are other nationalities scannell 
said 
by now everyone should know but you always have people who 
for a variety of reasons are reluctant to come forward

the investor group posing a takeover threat to 
gillette co is suing the company for allegedly using misleading 
and false statements in its campaign against the groups attempt to 
win four gillette board seats 
the group coniston partners filed a countersuit tuesday to 
gillettes april 14 federal court suit seeking to block coniston 
from soliciting shareholder votes for the board election at 
thursdays annual meeting 
the countersuit the latest in a series of skirmishes between 
coniston and the personal care products giant alleged that 
gillette presented misleading and false statements in material sent 
to its nearly 27000 shareholders and run in newspapers urging 
rejection of conistons takeover attempt 
victor lewkow one of conistons attorneys cited gillettes 
indication that coniston was interested in a greenmail payment 
to abandon its bid and a chart in tuesdays wall street journal 
showing that swiss tycoon tito tettamanti heads conistons 
tangled web of corporations 
it just isnt true said lewkow you can put anyone on top 
of a chart showing someone is in charge 
lewkow said the countersuit sought unspecified relief and 
dismissal of gillettes lawsuit the action does not try to block 
the annual meeting said lewkow 
in its lawsuit gillette claimed coniston violated federal laws 
by issuing material that did not fully outline all partners and 
investors affiliated with the takeover attempt 
voting results are not expected for at least a week following 
the meeting gillette said its suit should not delay the meeting 
the gillette suit names as defendants coniston principals 
augustus k oliver paul e tierney jr and keith r gollust in 
addition to tettamanti and several other firms holding large blocks 
of gillette stock 
on tuesday judge rya zobel ordered an april 29 pretrial 
hearing for both suits 
conistons bid received a boost monday when the california 
public employees retirement fund the fifthlargest gillette 
shareholder with about 15 million shares announced it would vote 
for the coniston candidates 
the two coniston partnerships have accumulated 676 million 
gillette shares or about 58 percent of the companys shares 
outstanding 
in several letters to shareholders since march gillette 
chairman and chief executive officer colman mockler jr claimed 
coniston planned to sell or dismember the bostonbased company 
coniston states it can boost company profitability and stock 
prices at gillette which paid nearly 580 million in late 1986 to 
halt revlon group incs repeated takeover attempts 
gillette laid off nearly 2400 workers and sold several 
unprofitable divisions during a restructuring after revlon signed a 
10year agreement not to seek control of the company

digital equipment corps new line of midrange 
computers offers a significant price performance increase and 
should intensify competition with rival international business 
machines corp industry analysts say 
digital looking to bounce back after reporting flat earnings 
for its latest quarter on tuesday introduced its second line of 
new systems in the last two months 
its a good move for dec said bruce watts an analyst with 
needham amp co it was time for them to upgrade their midrange of 
systems 
digital officials said the new vax 6200 series is designed to 
compete with ibms existing 9370 and 4381 computer 
its partly intended to place them in a strongly competitive 
position when ibm announces its codenamed silverlake products this 
summer watts said dec is getting their products out into the 
market first in order to prevent ibm from taking customers away 
digital based in maynard mass is the worlds secondlargest 
computer company and considered the industry leader in 
midperformance range computers 
the announcement came one week after digital reported a 08 
percent decrease in profits for the latest quarter while ibm 
announced a 163 percent rise reversing a twoyear trend in the 
battle between the companies 
digital stock rose 12 cents to 10112 a share in composite 
new york stock exchange trading tuesday 
the new computers which will cost between 131600 and 
653200 will be available immediately digital said 
digital last month introduced several mainframe computers in its 
vax 8800 series in a direct challenge to ibm 
sonny monosson a bostonbased independent analyst said the new 
series provides high performance and processing capacity for a low 
price 
i think this price performance is significant he said 
ibm and digital are competing and this is a good price 
performance 
monosson said the competition between the two giants could have 
a side effect on smaller companies in the midrange computer 
market such as prime computer and data general inc 
the byproduct of all this ibmdec competition is going to hurt 
all the other vendors he said 
the company said the singleprocessor 6210 computer provides 28 
times the performance of its vax 11780 system the system can 
accommodate up to four processors at once 
upgrades will cost between 100200 and 173500 digital said

grumman corps planned expansion here is 
evidence that oildependent houston is trying to get more involved 
in aircraft and aerospace industries according to a local 
development official 
grumman officials said tuesday the companys southwest regional 
development and production center will be built on a 66acre parcel 
of land and will include an office building and several other 
structures 
the project will mean 1000 new jobs in the next year and an 
initial investment of 10 million over two years 
grumman feels betting a large part of our company future on 
houston is a good bet jj bussolini grumman vice president for 
business operations said at a news conference 
lee hogan president of the houston economic development 
council said tuesdays announcement illustrated houstons efforts 
to get involved in aircraft and aerospace industries 
we are now as interested in that as the price of oil he 
said 
bussolini said grumman was convinced to select houston with 
incentives to locate at ellington field a strong work ethic shown 
by employees at its existing houston operations an excellent pool 
of potential employees and cost savings for construction and 
operations of new facilities compared with other parts of the 
country 
grumman an aircraft and aerospace company with annual sales of 
more than 35 billion now employs about 500 people in houston and 
33000 people worldwide 
grumman said work in houston will include civil space programs 
manufacturing and development on air force missile programs and 
engineering support for grumman programs throughout the country 
none of the new houston jobs would be the result of transfers 
from other grumman facilities bussolini said company officials 
said houstons job count could grow to 2000 or more depending on 
the outcome of several nasa and defense department programs 
the bethpage nybased company selected houston from among 
other potential sites in pennsylvania north and south carolina 
georgia and alabama 
the new center will be built on land grumman leased last year 
from the city at ellington field a former air force base now owned 
by the city 
the land originally was earmarked for grummans civil space unit 
for nasa space station work but nasa selected rival bidder 
mcdonnell douglas corp for the job 
the new project culminates efforts by officials of the houston 
economic development council 
the loss of the space station contract was a serious setback 
to our corporate plan bussolini said but added that houston 
officials kept encouraging the company to add to its presence in 
the city

international business machines corp 
says it isnt getting out of the copier busienss in agreeing to 
have eastman kodak co sell and service ibm copiers but the 
computer giant acknowledges copiers are not as crucial to it as in 
the past 
kodak will take over existing rental agreements and within a 
year will replace the ibm nameplate on the companys three machines 
with a kodak logo ibm spokesman andy russell said tuesday 
kodak will continue selling its ektaprint line of copiers some 
of which directly compete with ibm machines kodak already sells a 
canonmade copier under its ektaprint brand 
copiers are not as crucial as they were in the past theyre 
not attachable to our systems but today our emphasis is on 
integrating systems personal computers and printers russell 
said 
however russell said from the companys headquarters in armonk 
ny that ibm would continue utilizing its copier development and 
manufacturing abilities he also said that giving up the copier 
sales and service aspects would allow ibm to concentrate on 
computers and printers 
kodak ibm and xerox corp are the dominant copier companies in 
the expensive highvolume copying segment according to industry 
statistics compiled by dataquest inc a san jose califbased 
market research firm 
of the 29400 machines owned or rented last year in the segment 
which includes machines that make 70 or more copies a minute xerox 
had 14400 ibm had 6000 and kodak had 4700 
kodak and ibm also sell copiers that operate in the midvolume 
range of 45 to 69 copies a minute said mary lou demers a copier 
industry analyst at dataquest 
the agreement announced tuesday which must be approved by 
federal regulators pertains only to machines in the united states 
negotiations for a similar agreement in other countries are under 
way 
for kodak the deal is a great chance to grab ibms loyal 
customer base something the photo giant and others have been 
unsuccessfully trying to do for years said demers 
it will be interesting to see what happens as the sales 
agreements run out and its time to renew demers said well 
see if kodak can retain that same loyalty 
she said she was not surprised at tuesdays announcement 
people in the industry have been wondering for several years 
whether ibm was either going to introduce some brand new machine or 
get out of the business demers said

sears roebuck and co which is acquiring 
western auto supply co will test a further expansion of its 
automotive operations with a new chain of freestanding auto 
service centers according to a company spokesman 
the freestanding centers generally will be smaller than those 
attached to 797 sears stores but will offer a similar array of 
services including oil changes tire installation and suspension 
repairs spokesman gordon jones said tuesday 
specific dates numbers of stores and locations have not been 
determined jones said the centers will carry the sears name he 
said 
the purpose of this test is to appeal to a broader range of 
motorist customers he said 
the chicago suntimes reported tuesday that sears the nations 
largest retailer would open 50 to 100 of the new outlets annually 
each about 5000 square feet in size with up to six service bays 
the newspaper attributed the information to retail sources it did 
not identify 
industry analysts said the freestanding centers would 
complement sears acquisition of kansas city mobased western 
auto which sears said last month it would acquire in a 402 
million deal 
its a good fit with western auto said don wampach of 
oberweis securities it could tie those two operations together 
wampach said there was room for growth in the autocare market 
especially with k mart the nations no 2 retailer no longer 
including auto service bays in its new stores

united auto workers negotiators will 
not give up ground the union has won in past contracts a top uaw 
official said after chrysler corp proposed limiting the age at 
which workers may get early retirement benefits 
we arent taking any concessionswe arent going to tolerate 
any takeaways uaw vice president marc stepp said tuesday 
the union and the nations thirdlargest automaker entered their 
third day of talks today over a contract covering about 66000 
active and laidoff workers in 15 states and 65000 retirees 
negotiators attempting to fit to chrysler an industry pattern 
contract established last fall at general motors corp and ford 
motor co 
stepp declined to comment further on chrysler contract proposals 
presented tuesday including the costcutting early retirement 
changes that are expected to meet opposition from labor 
uaw workers won the right to retire early after 30 years of 
service during general motors corp talks in 1970 after a 69day 
strike the right was limited to workers 58 or older with the 
minimum age lowered to 56 in 1972 
but the age minimum was eliminated in 1973 after a nineday 
strike against chrysler and workers are not expected to accept a 
floor on early retirement easily 
anthony st john the chrysler vice president who is the 
automakers chief negotiator said chrysler wanted the minimum 
early retirement age and union support for flexible work agreements 
both changes from the pattern contract because 
chrysler is smaller than gm and ford so its costs to produce 
each car and truck are higher st john estimated the pattern 
contract would cost chrysler 3 to 350 more an hour than it costs 
gm and 50 cents more an hour than it costs ford 
chryslers work force is aging rapidly with an average age o 
44 it has only 11 active workers supporting each retiree 
chrysler doesnt need to trim its work force as much as gm and 
ford and would rather keep its already trained workers on the job 
during more of their prime under socalled 30andout 
retirements a worker who entered the factory at age 18 can retire 
at age 48 and receive 1350 a month in pension payments 
st john said chryslers new proposal would set a minimum age 
such as 55 for 30andout retirements 
we need to overcome those natural disadvantages by enhancing 
our ability to compete with them as well as the transplants and the 
foreign competition st john said the socalled transplants are 
japaneseowned factories in the united states which by 1990 will 
be capable of producing at least 25 million vehicles annually 
uaw and chrysler officials expect to complete a new contract in 
two to three weeks if they are successful the new contract will 
replace the old threeyear pact before its scheduled sept 14 
expiration 
chrysler also wants uaw leaders to support the companys push 
for modern operating agreements or plant contracts that organize 
workers into teams and give the company flexibility in using 
workers 
six plants have adopted moas and chrysler wants similar 
agreements at all its other plants but many workers believe the 
team concept which reduces the need for workers who fill in for 
absentees inspect products and repair others mistakes reduces 
job security 
most moas have been adopted under threat of a plant closing or 
loss of work to other plants

consumer prices propelled by a record rise in clothing costs 
shot up 05 percent in march the biggest increase since january 
1987 the labor department said today 
the overall gain amounting to 64 percent on an annual basis 
seemed sure to further economists concerns that inflation may be 
rebounding 
besides the 20 percent jump in apparel costs retail prices 
were also driven upward by a 04 percent gain in gasoline costs 
the first rise since august and a 03 percent hike in food prices 
taken together clothing food and transportation price 
increases accounted for half the march jump which was more than 
double the 02 percent gain of february 
but in the housing sector a sharp rise in construction of 
singlefamily homes in march more than offset a decline in 
apartment construction according to the commerce department 
the department reported tuesday that housing starts rose 19 
percent overall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 154 
million units in march after a 96 percent advance in february 
the report didnt help the stock market which finished 
generally lower after a daylong rally faded 
the dow jones average of 30 bluechip stocks finished down 862 
at 199950 after being up by 32 points at midafternoon most 
broader market indices also fell 
mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions said the backtoback rises in housing starts 
indicated the housing industry has recovered from its slump in 
december and january 
housing starts plummeted 158 percent in december and drifted 
another 12 percent lower in january analysts attributed the 
decline to builders fears that the october stock market crash 
would dampen home buying and to the precrash buildup in mortgage 
interest rates 
whatever problems there might have been in the worst of the 
winter months housing seems to have recovered pretty much 
obrinsky said its not going to be a boom year for housing but 
the decline from last year should be pretty moderate 
housing construction hit an eightyear high of 181 million 
units in 1986 and fell 10 percent in 1987 analysts are projecting 
another 4 percent to 8 percent decline this year 
rates for 30year fixedrate mortgages which shot up above 
115 percent before the stock market crash dipped below 10 percent 
in february and march before rising to 1019 percent last week 
economists are projecting rates of about 11 percent by the end of 
the year 
the strength in starts last month came in construction of 
singlefamily housing which rose 71 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 118 million units after an even stronger 
89 percent climb in february 
construction of multifamily units fell 123 percent to an 
annual rate of 358000 units the construction of buildings with 
five or more units was at its lowest rate since june 1982 during 
the last recession 
apartment construction has been slumping because the new tax law 
passed in 1986 removed many of the tax shelter benefits of 
investing in real estate the old law also had encouraged 
overbuilding in some areas

chevron corp is changing its 1986 profit 
to a 14 billion loss and is raising its 1987 profit from 1 
billion to 125 billion because of a routine bookkeeping 
requirement 
the oil company said on tuesday the change was needed to meet 
the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards 
no 96 which was approved by the accounting standards board last 
december 
because of the change the company had to restate its 1986 and 
1987 earnings resulting in the 1986 net loss and an increase in 
1987 profits 
the accounting change resulted from chevrons 1984 acquisition 
of gulf oil 
the change led the company to post the 14 billion net loss for 
1986 instead of the previously announced 715 million net profit 
and a 125 billion profit for 1987 instead of the previous 1 
billion

japan has made great strides in trying to prevent 
sales of banned high technology items to soviet bloc countries but 
there still is a potential for further violations a us state 
department official said wednesday 
allan wendt senior representative for strategic technology 
policy spent two days discussing issues related to the 
coordinating committee for export to communist nations which 
governs the sales of restricted items by western countries 
the talks included japanese concerns that the us congress will 
retaliate against toshiba machine co for selling banned equipment 
to the soviet union that enabled the soviets to build quieter 
submarines wendt said 
the two sides also discussed improvements in the japanese export 
system cooperation in implementing export controls and cooperative 
areas of enforcement plus streamlining control lists cooperation 
from third countries and the liberalization of export controls for 
china 
wendt said japan has enacted a new law that toughens the 
penalties against violators and said 2200 japanese companies have 
established internal controls to prevent further violations 
i certainly hope there will never be another toshiba 
machinetype case which everyone knows was an egregious 
violation he said i think there will continue to be 
violations of the cocom rules i think it would be unrealistic not 
to expect violations human greed has been with us for a long 
time and is unlikely to disappear he said 
wendt said japan has come a long way in a short period of 
time but that work is still needed to make sure progress 
continues 
wendt acknowledged there were problems with systems like japans 
where the ministry of international trade and industry is in charge 
of promoting trade and handling inspections at the same time he 
said it was better to have different agencies within government 
responsible for different areas 
but wendt added that it would take time for japan to make the 
necessary changes much as it took the united states several years 
to make corrections following similar violations in the 1970s

ready to seek a reasonable compromise but only on the price package 
in its entirety 
the comment reflected the commissions determination to defend 
its 198889 price package that began april 1 the package was put 
together under orders of the government leaders of the 12 eec 
nations 
the commission seeks to limit spending on subsidies for the 
eecs 103 million farmers to 275 billion european currency units 
or 338 billion dollars this year 
this is the same as in 1987 and follows years of runaway 
spending led to overproduction and trade frictions with the united 
states 
the farm ministers formally agreed to impose stabilizers on 
eecs farm spending agreed to by the eec summit meeting last 
february these will curb production as soon as output levels and 
spending reach a fixed level 
the ministers opened their first round of discussions on the 
198889 price package monday the meeting ended early wednesday and 
a second round will be held may 1617 in brussels 
it is premature to expect the ministers will reach a common 
agreement by then the commission official said 
in recent years the farm price talks have dragged on for many 
months in often roundtheclock meetings with the ministers wearing 
each other down to get concessions the negotiations have rarely 
been concluded before april 1 when the new marketing yuear begins 
for some products 
officials said they expected this years negotiations to be 
completed in early june

the government plans to lower tariffs 
on imported cars and reduce several domestic taxes on foreign 
vehicles to those on domestic automobiles trade and industry 
ministry officials said wednesday 
the officials said the measures contained in plans presented 
tuesday during a meeting with members of the south korean auto 
industry were designed to avoid trade friction with other 
countries and increase the competitiveness of local carmakers 
they did not say when the proposed measures would take effect 
the united states has accused south korea of imposing 
discriminatory restrictions on american cars while enjoying free 
access to the us auto market 
south korea responded earlier this month by lifting its ban on 
imports of foreign cars but imposed high tariffs and bureaucratic 
red tape 
the ministry now plans to lower import duties from the present 
30 percent to 25 percent next year to 20 percent in 1990 and to 15 
percent in 1992 the officials said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
they said the plans also call for reducing the local acquisition 
tax on the foreign cars from the present 30 percent to 2 percent 
the same as for domestic automobiles car operation and licence 
taxes for foreign cars may also be cut under the plans 
also car owners now must buy the equivalent of 4030 in 
government bonds when registering a foreign automobile and the 
officials said that may be abolished or drastically reduced 
for small south korean cars the bond purchase is about 270000 
won or 364 although about 16 million won or 2160 in bonds 
are required to register costlier local automobiles the bonds 
mature in five years 
meanwhile officials said the ministry would encourage domestic 
car makers to buy more us parts and components 
also new car makers both wholly owned local companies and 
those with foreign partners will be allowed to operate beginning 
in mid1989 
a july 1986 law banned joint production to avoid overproduction 
of automobiles and this kept the samsung business group from 
starting a car manufacturing plant together with chrysler corp of 
the united states 
there are now three large and two small car makers in south 
korea with a combined annual production capacity of 11 million 
vehicles they exported a total of 540000 cars last year most of 
which went to the united states and canada

norway will not attend next weeks meeting 
of opec and independent oilproducing nations in vienna austria 
but will send an observer a petroleum ministry official said 
wednesday 
the ministrys general director of marketing tore tonne will 
monitor the conference and hold bilateral talks with 
representatives of some of the 12 or 13 countries expected to 
participate said ministry spokesman egil helle 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
pricemonitoring committee comprised of the oil ministers of 
saudi arabia nigeria venezuela algeria and indonesia decided 
earlier this month to invite at least seven nonopec oil producers 
to meet for discussions on ways of cooperating to stabilize world 
oil prices 
the conference is expected to consider joint cuts in oil 
production 
a spokesman at opec headquarters in vienna james audu said 
wednesday that he had no information on which nonopec countries 
had agreed to attend the meeting which begins next tuesday he 
said mexico egypt china colombia angola malaysia brunei and 
oman had been invited 
helle the oil ministry spokesman said norway was not invited 
to participate in the vienna meeting mainly because it made it 
clear to opec officials through informal contacts that it did not 
want to attend 
helle said norways policy was not to participate in formal 
agreements or multilateral talks with opec or other oilproducing 
nations but to assist in stabilizing oil markets by taking 
unilateral measures 
helle said norway nonetheless was pleased that the vienna 
meeting had been arranged 
we regard it as very positive that more exporting countries 
outside opec are showing a willingness to contribute to stabilizing 
oil prices he said in a telephone interview 
norway has been holding its oil production 75 percent below 
capacity since february 1987 as a unilateral measure designed to 
help opec support prices helle said norway was not considering any 
additional measures

officer to succeed james e olson who died from cancer two days 
ago the company said today 
atampt also announced today its profit rose 106 percent in the 
first quarter to 492 million

guided atampt out of the confusion surrounding the 1984 breakup of 
the bell system 
the company said the board made its choice tuesday night the 
board named no successor for allen as president 
i fully intend to continue leading atampt on the course jim set

up from 445 million or 40 cents a share a year earlier revenue 
rose 28 percent to 835 billion from 812 billion a year

commitment to keep profits growing through 1988 at the first 
quarter rate 
he also promised to carry on the legacy of olson 
allen was born in missouri grew up in indiana and joined 
indiana bell in 1957 after being graduated from wabash college in

he is not perceived as a dynamic speaker but said he was working on 
his delivery 
allen said his management ability and his willingness to 
delegate responsibility were among his greatest strengths 
first and foremost im a team player he said

to complete voting on a pair of resolutions regarding affirmative 
action 
a resolution urging atampt to phase out its affirmative action 
policies which involve the hiring and promotion of minorities and 
women was made by the national alliance a white supremacist 
organization

alliance resolution but it also has opposed a resolution urging 
more affirmative action introduced by alex tillman a black 
manager at bell laboratories 
members of a local of atampts largest union the communication 
workers of america said they planned a rally against racism 
outside todays meeting 
speculation on who would succeed allen as president centered on

to the victor belong the spoils except in the 
merger business these days where even some losing bidders have 
taken home a cut of the pot 
the list of losers in some recent takeover battles includes 
names like developer donald trump appliance maker whirlpool corp 
and retailing giant rh macy amp co 
but its not as if these players walked away emptyhanded 
where vanquished raiders once faded from the scene with legal 
scars or a cash consolation prize players now are demanding assets 
and getting them in the form of real estate trademark rights 
even factories 
its all a matter of saving money and saving face winners dont 
like running up the price of their acquisitions in a bidding war 
any more than losers like getting shut out 
so while some rivals might turn up their noses to the idea of 
settling for half a loaf other more creative competitors are 
discovering that strategic advantage can be gained by carving up 
the pie 
i think we will see more negotiated settlements in larger 
transactions where there are pieces that may be of different value 
to different players said robert willard head of mergers and 
acquisitions at prudentialbache securities inc 
trumps recent struggle with entertainer merv griffin over 
resorts international inc is a case in point the new york 
developer had been trying to take the gaming and casino concern 
private since january and was less than genteel when griffin began 
publicly outlining his own strategy for acquiring the company 
it got a little testy indeed said one observer involved in 
the deal 
but after weeks of public jousting the two met in trumps 
office where it took just a few hours to sketch out a deal 
advisers and lawyers worked into the evening and trump and griffin 
were able to formalize the terms the next day by phone 
without that facetoface meeting there may well have been no 
deal said jack nusbaum trumps attorney who called the 
settlement a terrific result 
trump got what he said he wanted all along the taj mahal 
casino under construction in atlantic city nj and griffin got 
the rest of the company in part by purchasing trumps controlling 
interest for an undisclosed price 
its a rational way of resolving a situation rather than 
having at the end of the day prolonged the uncertainty one top 
takeover lawyer said 
in another case this past week fabric maker west 
pointpepperell inc and the investment firm odyssey partners sat 
down at the bargaining table after waging an extended bidding war 
for textile giant jp stevens amp co 
hammering out an agreement to divvy up the goods is a quick way 
to stop bids from escalating even though boards of directors want 
to keep the auction going for as long as possible to get the best 
price for their shareholders 
boards are more reluctant to accept one offer and lock out 
other bids said willard of prudentialbache 
rival bidders however have an interest in limiting their 
exposure from paying a higher price a negotiated settlement may 
result in your accomplishing your objective at a lower net cost 
noted one takeover expert 
michael hoffman senior vice president at smith barney harris 
upham amp co said in some cases it is the ego factor that can 
keep the bidding going to a point where the numbers dont make 
sense many observers say that was the case in canadian robert 
campeaus battle for federated department stores inc 
like most protracted takeover scenarios campeaus skirmishes 
with macy occurred largely in the courtroom investment banking and 
legal fees were estimated to total at least 200 million involving 
a battalion of more than 200 investment bankers and lawyers 
it does make sense to reach an accommodation with a competing 
bidder otherwise you can litigate forever said one lawyer 
involved in a recent takeover who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
campeau got the company for 66 billion but an agreement to 
sell two prized federated operations to macy for 11 billion 
allowed both companies to walk away as winners 
the alternative would have been for the bidders to just offer 
a higher price assuming it can be financed said one lawyer 
involved in the dealbut macys and campeau both are rather thin 
in terms of financing 
the meeting of rival bidders or their attempts to meet happens 
often insiders say 
those sorts of feelers are thrown out quite frequently in 
transactions that make business sense the only difference is that 
these companies have reached agreements said one takeover lawyer 
a negotiated agreement sometimes allows even the losing party to 
say it achieved its goals after splitting the spoils of the roper 
corp with general electric corp whirlpool chairman david whitwam 
was quick to note that gaining the roper brand name was one of 
whirlpools key strategic objectives in going after the georgia 
appliance maker in the first place 
roper had signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by 
whirlpool before general electric came on the scene ge known for 
its deep pockets ultimately offered 507 million topping 
whirlpools best bid by about 37 million 
whirlpool called ge shortly before its offer was about to 
expire and there was a very prompt resolution to the 
situation said one lawyer involved in the deal indeed an 
agreement was unveiled a day after the two companies said they were 
holding discussions 
among the terms of the agreement ge gets roper and its 
manufacturing operations while whirlpool will acquire rights to 
the roper name for major appliances 
part of it is how you portray the settlement to the world and 
everyone likes a winner said one attorney involved in a recent 
hostile bid 
willard of prudentialbache predicted that more takeover battles 
would result in negotiated settlements particularly those that 
involve large multidimensional targets 
to the extent that the target keeps an auction going theres 
going to be more talking among rivals he said

brussels belgium in the chaotic kitchen of global oil 
politics opec is cooking with some of the same ingredients it used 
in 198586 to serve up historys most spectacular oil price flop 
this time however the recipe includes some less explosive 
elements and experts say this means a remake of the price crash is 
unlikely 
for consumers that means the retail price of gasoline and other 
products refined from crude oil may be fairly steady this summer 
new clues to the future direction of oil prices are expected to 
emerge from two meetings of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries this week on tuesday a fiveman opec panel will meet 
with representatives of several nonopec oil producing nations and 
on thursday all 13 cartel members are to open private talks 
in some significant ways opecs current struggle to stop 
freemarket forces from pushing down oil prices is unfolding much 
as it did three years ago 
the most obvious similarity is that opec once again is losing 
the battle the world price of oil has been below the cartels 
target level of 18 per 42gallon barrel for much of this year 
beyond that there are these parallels 
saudi arabia the cartels biggest producer is going it alone 
in mid1985 saudi king fahd declared he no longer would let 
saudi production decline while other opec members were cheating on 
price and output rules this was the beginning of the end of opecs 
attempts to regulate the world price last month fahd publicly 
reasserted this policy meaning if effect that the cartel had 
again lost hope of singlehandedly defending a fixed oil price 
key opec members including saudi arabia kuwait and indonesia 
appear to have decided the cartel should stop fighting the price 
decline by cutting production when this feeling became widespread 
in opec in late 1985 the result was a kind of anarchy opec hoped 
to win back part of its market share from nonopec producers but 
it did not expect the stunning price collapse that followed 
this time however the memory of what happened in 1986 when 
prices tumbled below 10 a barrel is likely to persuade the 
cartel leadership to at least keep existing production controls in 
place also iran is more aggressively fighting to retain the opec 
strategy of cutting production 
opec is turning to independent producers for help in limiting 
oil production 
when prices were falling gradually in early 1985 opec saw that 
its production cuts were too little unable or unwilling to cut 
more the cartel stepped up efforts to win restraint from nonopec 
producers oil ministers from mexico egypt malaysia and other 
independent oilproducing nations attended several opec meetings in 
198485 as observers but the contacts yielded few results by 1986 
the outsiders had stopped coming to the opec meetings 
this week opec is returning to this tactic its pricemonitoring 
committee comprised of the oil ministers of saudi arabia 
nigeria venezuela algeria and indonesia is to meet with 
representatives of several nonopec producers including mexico and 
egypt to press for cooperation in limiting production 
in opecs view all oil producers share a responsibility for 
restraining production in order to keep prices high enough to 
justify the level of investment needed to find oil supplies for the 
future 
many nonopec countries dont agree the worlds two largest oil 
producers the soviet union and the united states and major 
producers britain and norway will not be attending the vienna 
meeting 
the chances of opec and independent producers reaching agreement 
any time soon on joint production cuts appear slim in the event 
they are unsuccessful the key question is what will opec do next 
in 1985 the cartels response to getting a cold shoulder from 
nonopec was to declare an unofficial price war this time that 
is much less likely to happen given the severe financial wounds 
that opec member countries have suffered in recent years 
the odds of opec letting prices fall uncontrollably also are 
lessened by the fact that prices adjusted for inflation and the 
depreciation of the us dollar already are as low as they were in 
1986 
the outlook for opec is further clouded by growing friction 
within the cartel relations between the saudis and iranians have 
been at a low ebb since riots in the islamic holy city of mecca in 
saudi arabia last summer killed 402 people including 275 iranians 
the political climate between iran and its persian gulf 
neighbors has worsened this spring with iranian gunboat attacks on 
united arab emirate shipping and oil facilities in the gulf and the 
hijacking of a kuwait airways plane by shiite moslem gunmen 
demanding the release of 17 proiranian terrorists held in kuwait

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade as concerns about dry weather 
faded from the pits 
reports of unusually dry conditions in the central and northern 
plains gave the grain markets a scare tuesday and drove prices up 
but those fears evaporated today on forecasts for rain in the 
affected areas 
basically we had a little bit of a weathertype move yesterday 
but traders who had been buying on that information are having 
second thoughts this morning said walter spilka an analyst in 
new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
spilka said it was early in the season to be worried about 
weather damage to corn and soybeans planting of those crops is 
barely underway 
but analysts say the weather is likely to figure strongly in 
price movement this season because of market fears about tight 
supplies of corn and soybeans 
in early trading wheat was unchanged to cent lower with may 
at 313 a bushel corn was cent to cent lower with may at 
205 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 
166 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with may 
at 669 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly 
lower in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 33 cent to 52 cent higher with april at 7515 
cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 22 cent higher with 
april at 7915 cents a pound hogs were unchanged to 25 cent lower 
with april at 4445 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 17 
cent lower to 28 cent higher with may at 5205 cents a pound 
livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on tuesday

share for 85 million shares or 45 percent of irving 
the original proposal announced on monday was for 65 a share 
for 95 million shares or about 51 percent of the outstanding 
shares 
bank of new york is offering 15 in cash and 1575 of its common 
shares for each of irvings roughly 181 million common shares 
outstanding it began its tender offer last month after receiving 
approval from the fed and new york state banking board 
bank of new york which holds a 49 percent stake in irving is 
also running a slate of 16 nominees to irvings board of directors 
irving chairman joseph a rice said the amended offer would 
provide shareholders with substantially more value than the offer 
by the bank of new york co and we urge our shareholders to reject 
the bny offer at the annual shareholders meeting on saturday 
in a statement irving said banca commericiale believes that 
the 75 per share cash prices of the revised offer better refelects 
the overall value of ibc irving bank corp common stock through 
market purchases 
but bank of new york spokesman owen brady maintained the revised 
offer in our opinion is worse as a whole is worse especially for 
small sharehodlers 
its a typical frontend load deal he said theyre 
putting a lot of stuff up front and its uncertain whether some of 
the benefits will ever be realized 
in midday trading on the new york stock exchange irving stock 
was unchanged at 6075 a share while bank of new york was up 12 
cents to 3150

bilion and is italys seocnd largest bank behind banca nazionale

consumer prices propelled by a record rise in 
clothing costs shot up 05 percent in march the biggest increase 
since january 1987 the government said today 
besides the 20 percent jump in apparel costs retail prices 
were also driven upward by a 04 percent gain in gasoline costs 
the first rise since august and a 03 percent hike in food prices 
taken together clothing food and transportation price 
increases accounted for half the march jump which was more than 
double the 02 percent gain of february 
the overall gain amounting to 64 percent on an annual basis 
heightened economists concerns that inflation may be rebounding 
the consumer price index had risen a moderate 44 percent last year 
and a tiny 11 percent in 1986 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater saiddespite large 
increases for consumer and producer prices in march the smaller 
increases in prices in previous months and the expected slower 
growth in total demand in future months indicate that inflation 
remains under control 
this is the first dose of inflation we have had since the 
first half of 1987 said donald ratajczak head of the 
forecasting project at georgia state university if things dont 
settle down by may then i think the federal reserve will have to 
put fighting inflation pretty high on the agenda 
the central bank fights inflation by raising interest rates and 
thus slowing the pace of economic activity while economists had 
not expected the fed to slow economic growth during a presidential 
election year many analysts now believe that the fed has already 
taken a small step toward tightening credit with more steps to come 
todays labor department report blamed the sharp increase in 
clothing costs the steepest onemonth increase since records were 
first kept in 1947 on substantially higher priced spring and 
summer merchandise particularly womens clothing 
indeed prices for womens and girls clothing rose 39 percent 
after falling in january and february prices for mens and boys 
apparel were up 12 percent 
clothing prices normally rise in the spring last months jump 
37 percent once the departments seasonal adjustment process is 
factored out was even greater than analysts had expected however 
the department gave these other specifics on march retail price 
activity 
gasoline prices rose 04 percent after falling 17 percent in 
february and 16 percent in january from september through 
february gasoline prices had fallen 59 percent 
grocery store prices rose 04 percent after falling 06 percent 
in february 
leading the way was a 02 percent gain in prices for fresh 
fruits and vegetables virtually all the increase was in fresh 
fruit prices while the costs of fresh vegetables continued to 
decline 
after soaring 255 percent in 1987 fresh vegetable prices have 
fallen 149 percent so far this year 
the costs of buying meat poultry and eggs were all up with egg 
prices rising 46 percent

new automobile prices rose 03 percent but that increase was 
largely offset by a 14 percent drop in the cost of obtaining car 
loans 
home heating oil prices rose 08 percent while the cost of 
natural gas and electricity was down 03 percent 
public transportation costs climbed 05 percent reflecting 
widespread airline fare increases 
medical care costs rose 04 percent such expenses gained 77 
percent in the first three months of 1987 and were the fastest 
rising major segment of the consumer price calculation 
overall retail prices have risen at a 42 percent annual rate 
so far this year 
the march increase left the index at 1165 meaning that a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing 100 during a 19824

northrop corp said a tax accounting change 
was responsible for more than tripling its firstquarter profit 
despite a 3 percent sales decline 
the aerospace contractor said tuesday that its net income rose 
to 1396 million or 297 a share for the first three months of 
the year from 406 million or 87 cents a share in the same 
period last year 
firstquarter sales fell to 137 billion from 141 billion in 
1987 
the latest results were helped by a tax accounting change that 
increased earnings by 1351 million the company said 
northrops operating profit in its aircraft electronics and 
services businesses fell 35 percent to 675 million from 1036 
million a year earlier 
the reduction in sales was attributed to lower sales in the 
companys electronic countermeasures product line and to a lower 
level of customersponsored research and development 
nonetheless the company reported increased deliveries of the 
main fuselage section for the boeing 747 jetliner and increased 
sales in the mx peacekeeper program 
northrop is the prime contractor on the b2 advanced technology 
bomber also known as the stealth bomber because of its 
radarevading characteristics 
the company said the earnings were also depressed by an 
unspecified amount as the company continued to spend on development 
of a prototype of the air forces 21st century warplane the 
advanced tactical fighter

president reagans spokesman said today the 
white house is pretty pessimistic that it will receive a trade 
bill from congress that the president will be able to sign 
marlin fitzwater also told reporters he believed it would be 
possible to sustain a presidential veto 
fitzwater spoke as democratic leaders prepared for a house vote 
on this week after jettisoning a provision opposed 
by the administration requiring public disclosue legislation thres by 
foreign 
investors 
still in the measure however are a number of sections also 
opposed by the administration including one requiring advance 
notice to employees of plant closings 
i would say we are not too optimsitic at this point 
fitzwater said the indications have been that the congress is 
not going to relent on plant closings as well as some of the other 
provisions so i would say we are pretty pessimistic that we will 
get a bill well sign 
asked about prospects for sustaining a veto he said we 
certainly would work to sustain it and we think it could happen 
the president i think has made it abundantly clear that in its 
present form it will draw a veto treasury sechat on thursdays roll 
call would cast new 
doubt over the legislation 
house minority leader robert h michel rill emerging from a 
leadership meeting at the white house on tuesday morning said he 
would attempt to marshal the support to sustain the presidents 
veto before it gets to the senate 
the senate takes up the bill next week and it is expected to 
pass there without much trouble but senators from both parties 
said it would be difficult to muster the twothirds 
id be amazed if there were not enough votes to sustain a 
veto said sen bob packwood rore top republican on the 
senate finance committee and a critic of the legislation 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas one of 
the bills chief sponsors said he expected a veto and overriding 
it will be very tough 
he said lawmakers have made concession after concession in a 
futile attempt to win support for the measur from the president 
meanwhile senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
warned against a spreading belief on capitol hill that lawmakers 
might get a second crack at the trade issue this year 
i hope we will not believe the conventional wisdom that if the 
president vetoes this bill the congress will quickly pass a 
stripped down version byrd said

shearson lehman brothers holdings inc said wednesday that 
firstquarter earnings rose slightly and revenue jumped 47 percent 
which the brokerage giant attributed partly to its postcrash 
purchase of ef hutton group inc 
wall street analysts said the results were respectable 
considering the enormous trading losses suffered by many firms 
after the oct 19 market collapse including those of hutton which 
was acquired late last year 
the parent of shearson lehman hutton inc said earnings totaled 
81 million for the three months ended march 31 up 26 percent 
from the 78 million earned a year earlier 
pershare earnings were 81 cents the company said it did not 
provide yearearlier pershare earnings because at that time the 
stock was held by american express co and wasnt sold publicly 
until last may shearson has about 99 million shares and 
equivalents outstanding 
firstquarter revenues totaled 25 billion up 47 percent from 
17 billion a year earlier much of the gain was derived from the 
companys increased customer base as a result of the hutton 
acquisition 
but firstquarter expenses also surged from 16 billion to 24 
billion a 51 percent gain that shearson attributed partly to costs 
associated with the incorporation of huttons staff and property 
into its operations 
investment banking revenues more than doubled from 172 million 
to 357 million reflecting strong merger and acquisition and 
merchant banking activities the company said 
we are particularly pleased with the quarterly increase given 
the lower levels of investor participation in the financial markets 
and the nonrecurring charges associated with the hutton acquisiton 
that are being recognized in 1988 said peter a cohen chairman 
and chief executive officer 
shearsons earnings were reported a day after several other 
major brokerages reported sharply lower firstquarter results 
which they ascribed to a business slump following the crash 
perrin long a brokerage analyst at lipper analytical securities 
corp in new york said one reason for the healthier results from 
shearson is that theyre somewhat better managed

the supreme court ruled today the government 
may disqualify military veterans who are alcoholics from receiving 
benefits by viewing their condition as willful misconduct 
rather than an uncontrollable disease 
by a 43 vote the justices said the veterans administration in 
denying benefits to two men did not violate a federal law 
protecting the rights of the handicapped 
the court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease but 
said the va is not compelled to regard it as sch 
it is not our role to resolve this medical issue on which the 
authorities remain sharply divided said justice byron r white 
for the court 
white said a law known as section 504 of the rehabilitation act 
does not require the veterans administration to treat alcoholism as 
a disease the act passed by congress in 1973 bars federal 
programs or anyone receiving federal aid from discriminating 
against handicapped individuals solely because of their handicap 
in our view it is by no means clear that section 504 and the 
characterization of primary alcoholism as a willfully incurred 
disability are in irreconciliable conflict white said 
those who believe there is a conflict should ask congress to 
change the law he said 
three dissenters said the va should not be allowed to treat all 
alcoholics in the same way and automatically dismiss their benefit 
claims on grounds the veterans are guilty of misconduct 
this is the very kind of broad social generalization that 
section 504 of the rehabilitation act is intended to eliminate 
said justice harry a blackmun in dissent the petitioners in 
these cases ask only that their situations be given individualized 
evaluation 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
joining white were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy did not take part 
in the ruling 
the va policy that regards alcoholism as misconduct was 
challenged by eugene traynor 46 a supervisor in a photography 
laboratory in new york city and james p mckelvey 42 an 
alcoholism counselor in washington dc 
both men who began drinking when they were children received 
honorable discharges from the army in the late 1960s they said 
they have abstained from drinking alcohol since the early 1970s 
when they were hospitalized and treated for the condition 
the va authorizes payment of education benefits to veterans 
within 10 years of their discharge no benefits are paid after 10 
years unless a veteran can show he or she was unable to pursue an 
education because of a physical or mental disability which was 
not the result of such veterans own willful misconduct 
the va provides an exemption from the 10year time limit for 
alocholism only when it is a secondary sympton of other 
psychological problems 
traynor and mckelvey filed federal lawsuits claiming the 
veterans administration was discriminating illlegaly against the 
handicapped 
federal appeals courts ruled against them in separate cases 
mckelvey said the high courts decision gives a message to 
other recovering alcoholics or more importantly people that are 
out there struggling trying to get sober and dying from this 
disease i believe that the justices who ruled in favor of the 
veterans administration is giving them a license to kill more or 
less theyre saying that the veterans administration can violate 
existing federal statutes and get away with it 
a va spokesman john scholzen said the agency would have no 
comment until its attorneys have examined the ruling 
the cases attracted widespread attention with the current 
renewed debate over the nature of alcoholism 
many programs have developed in recent years that treat 
alcoholics as victims of a disease rather than as social deviants 
or criminals 
the psychiatrists catalogue of diseases called the diagnostic 
and statistical manual of mental disorders calls alcohol abuse and 
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all americans 
suffer from it at some point in their lives 
dr david goldman a researcher at the national institute on 
alcohol abuse and alcoholism said the medical community has gone 
far beyond the debate about whether alcoholism is a disease now 
he said researchers are trying to identify the specific gene that 
they believe makes a person vulnerable to alcoholism 
some critics fear the recent trend treating alcoholism as a 
disease dangerously removes individual responsibility for such 
behavior as drunken driving and spouse and child abuse 
norma phillips the national president of mothers against drunk 
driving said her organization welcomes the decision because she 
believes it will encourage judges to give tougher sentences in 
drunken driving cases 
there are some judges who feel people are not able to make a 
decision after they drink said mrs phillips of escondido 
calif they feel they have an alcohol problem so they give 
lighter sentences 
a spokesman for alcoholocs anonymous who asked not to be named 
said the question of whether or not alcohol abuse is a disease does 
not matter in aa treatment which calls for group support in 
staying sober 
weve never taken any position as to whether or not it is an 
illness because it doesnt really matter with our treatment 
system the spokesman said 
there are an estimated 10 million alcoholics in the united 
states including about one million who seek treatment annually in 
one form or another 
in other action the court 
ruled that unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to 
boycott neutral employers against whom the unions have no 
grievance 
voting 80 in a case from florida the justices said that 
although federal labor law generally prohibits unions from engaging 
in secondary boycott picketing of neutral employers it does not 
ban nonpicketing activities aimed at such businesses 
in a separate decision the court ruled by a 62 vote in a 
california case that employers may be forced to provide free 
internal mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at 
organizing employees 
upheld a law requiring munijcipal or state bonds issued after 
june 30 1983 to be registered before they can be taxexempt 
the justices by a 71 vote ruled that the federal law enacted 
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does 
not violate any states sovereign immunity 
the alcoholism case is traynor vs turnage 86622 
the psychiatrists catalogue of diseases called the diagnostic 
and statistical manual of mental disorders calls alcohol abuse and 
dependence a disease and says about 13 percent of all americans

heirs of the late newspaper magnate 
axel springer have won a bitter power struggle to gain control of 
the west german publishing empire the company announced wednesday 
the axel springer company said franz and frieder burda two 
stockholders who control 259 percent of the companys shares had 
sold their holdings to springers heirs 
that gives the springer family a 52 percent majority interest in 
the concern according to the statement which was also issued in 
the name of the burda brothers 
the burdas action marks a sharp turnaround and a defeat for leo 
kirch a wealthy film distributor who had been trying to increase 
his power within the springer company 
we the springer heirs and the burdas feel we are doing 
things along the lines mr springer wanted before he died ernst 
cramer adviser to the springer family said in a telephone 
interview from his west berlin office 
peter von maydell spokesman for the burda brothers also 
confirmed the stock sale 
the industry newspaper neue medien in hamburg reported the 
deal was worth 530 million marks about 320 million maydell said 
he could not confirm the reported price 
friede springer axel springers widow had been trying to block 
kirchs efforts to increase his power within the company mrs 
springer and the burdas are members of the companys supervisory 
board but kirch is not 
powers within the springer company have been squabbling since 
the 73yearold axel springer died on sept 22 1985 leaving his 
wife and two sons as direct heirs 
springer built a familyowned empire that in addition to bild 
west germanys largest newspaper also includes a respected 
conservative daily die welt 
before his death axel springer converted his empire into a 
joint stock company 
under a complicated formula springers heirs and executors were 
given control of 261 percent of the company shares the burda 
brothers 259 percent and kirch 10 percent the rest went to the 
stock exchange 
last month kirch and the burdas signed an agreement to pool 
their springer shares in an effort to gain control of a majority of 
the company stock kirch said he had gained support from the 
holders of a further 16 percent of springer stock 
kirch and the burdas said at the time they had concluded the 
agreement as a means to ending the feuding at springer and to 
ensure the company had a good future 
but the federal cartel office last week said kirch and the 
burdas together had failed to come up with a majority of the shares 
the burdas who own a string of printing plants said in a 
statement wednesday they decided to sell their holdings to the 
springer family in the best interests of the company 
after it became clear this solution the attempt to form a 
majority with kirch could not be realized they the burdas saw 
no reason for that kind of partnership the statement said 
the burdas decided to sell their holdings to the springer heirs 
because the futureoriented development of axel springer verlag 
has the highest importance the statement said 
cramer spokesman for the springer family said he saw no 
contradiction between axel springers wishes for his company and 
the burdas selling their stock to springers heirs 
he divided the stocks that is true but that was not meant to 
be against the family he specified he wanted the stocks to be used 
to keep up the strength of the company we feel we are doing 
that said cramer 
kirchs spokeswoman armgard von burgsdorff said from her 
munich office that kirch would not comment on the burdas action

rockwell international corp the 
aerospace automotive and electronics firm reported secondquarter 
earnings rose 24 percent but gave most of the credit to a tax 
adjustment 
rockwell said wednesday that profits rose to 2184 million or 
81 cents per share from 1756 million or 62 cents per share in 
the second quarter of 1987 
sales totaled 3 billion in the three months ended march 31 
down from 316 billion for the comparable period in 1987 largely 
because of a 24 percent decline in sales of b1b bombers rockwell 
expects to deliver the 100th and last b1b to the air force late 
this month 
the favorable tax adjustment resulted from deferral of income on 
the b1b program from previous years for tax purposes the 
earnings deferred under the completed contract method are taxed 
at a lower rate under the new tax law 
donald r beall chairman and chief executive officer said 
earnings excluding the tax adjustment were comparable with last 
year 
earnings for the first half of the current year were 4113 
million or 152 per share up from 325 million or 115 per 
share in the first half of 1987 firsthalf revenues were 57 
billion off from 6 billion in the first half of last year

share on revenue of 24 billion compared with net income of 
1054 million or 245 a share on revenue of 23 billion for

overall improvement in the government aerospace segment said

the improvement was made despite continued investments in advanced 
aircraft programs and lower production of the groundlaunched 
cruise missile as that contract nears its scheduled completion 
during 1988 
results of the companys submarine operations reflect increased 
production activity on the trident program pace said 
pace said san juan the first ship equipped with the new system 
is currently on sea trials and performing successfully 
pace said that cessna remained profitable as a result of 
continued cost containment efforts in other lines of nondefense 
business he said the company continued to invest in production of 
18 atlascentaur launch vehicles 
backlog reached a record high with funded backlog at 173 
billion and total backlog at 249 billion comparable accounts in 
1987 were 157 billion and 217 billion

the wall street journal will be published in 
three sections rather than two starting in september in an effort 
to make the newspaper more convenient for readers to use the 
chairman of dow jones amp co said wednesday 
warren h phillips who is also chief executive of the company 
that publishes the journal said coverage of market trends and 
investment opportunities will be developed further extended well 
beyond the stock markets and organized in a separate third section 
for easier access 
he also said price quotations will be made more readable and 
unusual price or volume developments or trends will be pointed up 
in new ways 
the journal has been published in two sections since june 1980 
a spokesman for dow jones danforth austin said the addition of 
a new section would not necessarily increase the number of pages in 
the newspaper he said the change was seen as a way to organize 
coverage in a better fashion 
phillips disclosed the plans at the annual meeting of dow jones 
shareholders

british financier sir james goldsmith has 
acquired a stake in bf goodrich co but is not interested in taking 
over the former tire maker goodrich said wednesday 
goodrich issued a statement in response to a published report 
that at least one corporate raider and possibly two had acquired 
stakes in goodrich 
usa today reported in wednesdays editions that goldsmith has 
reportedly acquired close to 5 percent of goodrichs outstanding 
shares the securities and exchange commission requires 
stockholders to reveal their interest in a company if it exceeds 5 
percent 
the paper said another unidentified raider had purchased about 2 
percent of the companys 252 million outstanding shares 
goodrich said goldsmith called goodrich chairman john d ong on 
wednesday to say that the press reports indicating that he has an 
interest in acquiring goodrich are erroneous sir james told ong 
that he is a passive investor in the company there is no truth 
to the report that he has an intention to acquire a major stake 
goldsmith launched a takeover bid for akronbased tiremaker 
goodyear tire amp rubber co in 1986 but goodyear fought off the 
overture by buying goldsmiths 115 percent stake for 619 million 
goodyear since has sold major nontire assets to reduce the debt it 
incurred in fighting off goldsmith 
on monday goodrich reported firstquarter net income of 347 
million up from 38 million because of strong demand for some of 
the companys specialty chemical products 
the companys largest business is the production of polyvinyl 
chloride or vinyl its other major businesses are specialty 
chemicals and aerospace and defense products 
ong said monday that goodrich expects to complete the sale of 
the companys interest in uniroyal goodrich tire co within the 
next two months ending the 118yearold companys association with 
tires goodrich announced in december that an investment group 
formed by clayton amp dubilier inc agreed to buy its interest in 
uniroyal for 225 million 
goodrich and uniroyal inc combined their tire businesses into 
the akronbased uniroyal goodrich in august 1986

a supreme court ruling wednesday that 
alcoholism can be regarded as willful misconduct instead of a 
disease when determining veterans benefits will have little effect 
on the treatment of alcohol abuse or on insurance payments for 
rehabilitation according to experts 
most medical authorities accept the concept that there is an 
element of disease in alcoholism but that it also is a condition 
that involves an entire range of complex elements including 
heredity and social and environmental influences 
lee i dogoloff of the american council for drug education who 
was the carter administrations adviser on drug policy said 
alcoholism has all the features of any other disease with a 
beginning a progression and an endstage condition 
he said there are different types of alcoholics but that most 
medical researchers now accept that about 10 percent of the 
american population has what some call the genetic 
vulnerability to become helplessly addicted to alcohol 
do you have a choice to take that first drink dogoloff 
said sure but once that threshold is crossed it becomes a 
disease for many alcoholics 
he said the real concern about the supreme court ruling is how 
it will affect societys efforts to control alcoholism many 
companies dogoloff said provide services to help alcoholics 
recover because american industry has discovered that such programs 
are good for business 
by helping alcoholics stay sober he said there is a 
costtobenefit ratio of up to 7to1 this results from prevented 
accidents increased productivity and prevention of alcoholrelated 
health conditions such as liver disease that can be expensive to 
treat 
the ruling is unlikely to affect most health insurance payments 
for the cost of rehabilitation said rob bier a spokesman for the 
health insurance association of america 
health insurance is a contract and if it covers alcohol 
rehabilitation then that will not change no matter what the supreme 
court says bier said 
christine lubinski spokeswoman for the national council on 
alcoholism said her group is obviously very disappointed in the 
decision 
this is a blow to us and to morale she said however we 
feel like the state of the art in terms of both public 
awareness about alcoholism as well as the successful treatment of 
alcoholism will prevail 
dr david goldman a researcher at the national institute on 
alcohol abuse and alcoholism said it is widely accepted in the 
medical profession that alcoholism is a disease even though it may 
have an element of free choice 
there are diseases that involve choice that are still 
diseases he said an example is coronary artery disease if 
one eats fatty foods it contributes to the disease but it is 
still classified as a disease 
goldman said research has shown there is a genetic 
predisposition to alcoholism but that alcohol abuse also can 
involve what he calls environmental factors and an act of 
will 
the american medical association defines alcoholism as an 
illness the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental 
disorders a psychiatrists catalogue of diseases lists alcohol 
abuse and dependence 
but norma phillips the national president of mothers against 
drunk driving said too many judges accept the concept that drunks 
are helpless victims of an uncontrollable disease as a result she 
said some judges give light sentences for drunken driving 
mrs phillips said she hopes the supreme court ruling will 
change that 
i feel this decision is fair and just and that this encourages 
judges to give sentences to fit the crime of drunken driving she 
said the fundamental issue is responsibility just because a 
person is an alcoholic doesnt give them the right to get behind 
the wheel of a car when they are drunk 
the new ruling she said may force drunk drivers to accept the 
personal responsibility for their actions instead of ducking behind 
medical excuses

corn and soybean futures closed lower wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade soybeans sharply so as rain in 
the plains states washed away fears about weather damage to crops 
wheat advanced slightly 
profittaking took soybean prices down sharply near the close 
but prices had trended lower throughout the session 
the selloff in the corn and beans followed two days of gains 
triggered by fears that dry conditions in the northern plains would 
extend into the major cornandsoybean regions of the midwest 
analysts said the worries were premature since corn and soybean 
planting has only begun 
i think the markets are going through their usual gyrations 
this time of year said walter spilka an analyst in new york 
with smith barney harris upham amp co you get a brief rally on 
weather information then you get a little rain in the corn belt 
and that puts some pressure on the markets just because theyve 
been up a little 
wheat futures were supported by expectations of new export 
business analysts said 
at the close wheat was cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 315 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 
1 cents lower with may at 204 a bushel oats were 2 cents lower 
to cent higher with may at 166 a bushel soybeans were 5 
cents to 6 cents lower with may at 666 a bushel

the new chairman of first city bancorporation of 
texas inc said wednesday he was confident the revitalized company 
will make a profit its first year after a 16 billion federally 
assisted reorganization plan is completed 
first citys flag is flying high this is the moment weve all 
been waiting for said chicago investor a robert abboud the 
companys new chairman and chief executive 
late tuesday after a day of completing the necessary paperwork 
the federal deposit insurance corp transferred 970 million to the 
ailing bank abboud said 
it wasnt the parting of the red sea but its close to it 
he said after a long night we successfully completed the 
transaction and obviously were all pleased 
the bailout plan the second largest such rescue in us 
history also calls for a spinoff of 179 billion of poorly 
performing assets and a 500 million infusion of capital raised 
privately by a group headed abboud 
as part of the restructuring first city obtained a revolving 
line of credit with san jacinto savings association of houston as 
the lead lender san jacinto savings agreed to lend 68 million of 
the initial 108 million first city needs to pay off its debt 
holders 
abboud has predicted that the new first city the states 
fourthlargest bank holding company will make 74 million in its 
first year 104 million by its second year and 119 million by 
the third year 
certainly the figues that have been put forward are those 
that were operating under he said at a wednesday news 
conference 
an analyst that follows first city however said abboud is 
being too optimistic 
in our opinion it is going to be difficult to meet the 
forecasted loan growth assumptions said sandra flannigan 
analyst with painewebber in houston 
first city last posted a profit during the second quarter of 
1986 for 1987 the company posted a 11 billion loss in a report 
to the securities and exchange commission filed last month first 
city said it expected to lose 43 million by the time the rescue 
plan was completed 
the rescue plan implemented three months behind schedule was 
stalled by debt holders who were reluctant to tender their 
securities for less than face value the company originally had 
wanted 90 percent participation but then lowered the threshold to 
70 percent 
by a monday deadline the companys sixth only 675 percent or 
1524 million of the banks 2258 million in bonds had been 
tendered abboud said 
we had hoped to achieve a target around 68 percent or 
better he said 
the halfpercent is something we will take on to the books of 
the new first city and we will find it a challenge to take on that 
particular differential we would have been substantially closer 
but we had some withdrawals by savings and loans 
first city senior debt holders were offered 45 cents on the 
dollar for their debt under the plan while subordinated debt 
holders were offered 35 cents 
bonds not tendered by the deadline could be worth as much as 100 
cents on the dollar 
some investors who initially agreed to participate in a private 
placement of new first city securities got cold feet and backed 
out observers said but drexel burnham lambert inc a new york 
investment company guaranteed the sale of 100 million in the 
placement abboud said 
abboud also said first city entered a 10year agreement with 
electronic data systems corp to manage first city services corp 
the companys data processing subsidiary that employs 400 
this is not a sale this is not a sale of a first city 
company abboud said 
first city with 59 banks in texas and one in south dakota grew 
quickly during the texas oil boom but was hit hard by energy and 
real estate losses when oil prices plummeted 
leadership of the 122year institution will move from longtime 
houston banker james a elkins jr to abboud who has been working 
as a consultant for the company since september for 1 and a 225 
million expense account 
the assistance plan is the second largest by the fdic the 
federal agency pumped 45 billion to rescue continental illinois 
corp of chicago in 1984 
ownership of first city by existing shareholders will go from 
100 percent to 2 percent once the deal is completed

paging services in september firstquarter performance was on 
target with what wed expected chairman zane e barnes said 
bell atlantic chairman thomas e bolger attributed his companys 
increase in profit to the strength of the economy in the 
midatlantic region

consolidated rail corp reported a 44 percent drop in 
firstquarter profit wednesday while union pacific corp said its 
earnings increased 13 percent 
conrail blamed the decline on the loss of tax breaks when the 
company was sold to public ownership by the government last year 
the freight railroad which is based in philadelphia reported 
an aftertax profit of 48 million or 69 cents per share for the 
first three months of the year that was down from 86 million or

sheltered from federal taxes by carrying forward losses incurred in 
earlier years 
revenues rose 55 percent to 831 million from 788 million 
the company said that discounting the previous tax break its 
earnings declined just 2 percent for the quarter 
the tax advantage was canceled by federal legislation that 
allowed conrail to go public in a stock offering on march 26 1987 
firstquarter earnings in 1987 also were boosted by gains of 17 
million from real estate sales 
union pacific which has its headquarters in new york said it

of 1219 million or 107 per share in 1987 revenues rose to

currencies in light lethargic trading wednesday 
gold prices were mixed republic national bank of new york

traders said the dollar moved in a narrow range they noted 
there was some attempt to sell dollars after the labor department

anything said david godwin chief foreign exchange dealer at 
union bank of switzerland 
godwin noted that investors are still inclined to sell dollars 
but the threat that any selling will be met by central bank 
intervention keeps them holding onto the us currency 
people are just waiting for the dollar to break out of the 
current range then well see more activity he noted 
trading also was lethargic earlier in europe where the dollar 
finished little changed

stock prices declined broadly in quiet trading 
wednesday as new uncertainties about the inflation outlook put a 
damper on the market 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1409 to 
198541 registering its third consecutive loss since the start 
of the week the average has fallen 2852 points 
declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in the 
daily tally of new york stock exchangelisted activity with 483 
up 1039 down and 465 unchanged 
big board volume came to 14759 million shares against 16191 
million in the previous session the nyses composite index fell

the labor department reported wednesday morning that the

biggest monthly increase in the inflation gauge since it jumped 07 
percent in january 1987 
analysts said there was a general sense of relief on wall street 
that the figure wasnt worse 
rumors and conjecture that the increase might run close to a 
full percentage point sent both stock and bond prices lower in late 
trading on tuesday 
but even though that talk proved unwarranted brokers said the 
news left investors in a wary mood about prospects for possible 
credittightening by the federal reserve 
several bigname stocks failed to muster much favorable response 
to positive earnings news 
for example american telephone amp telegraph was unchanged at 
26 the company reported higher firstquarter profits and said it 
was aiming to sustain earnings growth at a 15 percent rate for the 
remainder of the year

actively traded stocks the market lost 1795 billion or 070 
percent in value 
nationwide turnover in nyselisted issues including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the overthecounter

american stores co declined comment 
wednesday on a report it will raise its bid from 45 to 50 a share 
for lucky stores inc which said it is talking to other parties 
about a possible sale of the supermarket chain 
mike holt spokesman for salt lake citybased american stores 
said he would not comment on a report by allbusiness radio station 
kmny in los angeles quoting unnamed lucky sources saying american 
would raise its bid soon 
meanwhile dublinbased lucky issued a statement that it is 
continuing to review a variety of alternatives to the pending 45 
tender offer by american stores with a view of providing lucky 
stockholders with greater value 
holt responded with the comment theyve been saying that all 
along 
however lucky also said for the first time it has had 
discussions with a number of lending institutions with respect to 
a possible leveraged recapitalization of the company 
none of the parties was named in the statement 
luckys shares gained 50 cents wednesday to 5375 in composite 
new york stock exchange trading 
luckys board of directors has not made a decision to sell and 
such a decision will be made only after a review of available 
alternatives is completed the statement said 
the merger of lucky and american stores could create the 
nations largest supermarket chain 
lucky said earlier this month its board rejected the unsolicited 
tender offer of 174 billion as inadequate and not in the best 
interest of the company or its stockholders 
the rejection came 17 months after lucky derailed a hostile 
takeover attempt by new york investor asher edelman

copper futures prices fell for the third straight day wednesday 
on indications of increasing supplies and concerns about higher 
interest rates 
on other markets precious metals also retreated livestock and 
meat futures advanced energy futures slipped lower grains and 
soybeans were mixed and stockindex futures gained 
copper futures on new yorks commodity exchange were primed for 
a sharp drop from a technical standpoint and several bearish 
fundamental factors gave the market a downward shove analysts said 
the first was a report tuesday that the us mint had been 
offered 4500 tons of copper at a price only 25 cents above the 
may futures price which settled wednesday at 922 cents a pound 
copper for immediate delivery has recently been selling anywhere 
from 3 cents to 6 cents above futures prices 
the second bearish factor was a report that chiles stateowned 
national mining co was selling on the open market copper that had 
been earmarked for export to brazil said bette raptopoulos metals 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
the copper was available because the brazilian government 
refused to issue import permits as part of its effort to correct a 
trade imbalance she said 
additionally industry reports indicated us copper mine 
production rose 21 percent in january and february compared to the 
same period a year ago and worldwide production increased 13 
percent in january said fred demler metals analyst in new york 
for drexel burnham lambert inc 
ms raptopoulos also cited persistent fears that the federal 
reserve will tighten the us money supply thereby raising 
interest rates which would impact adversely on copperconsuming 
industries such as housing and autos 
but demler cautioned that demand for copper remains strong and 
producer stocks are relatively low at 47000 tons 
this is a shortterm softening in the supplydemand balance 
going from a very tight situation to a shortterm surplus market 
he said a change in producer stocks of 20000 or 30000 tons 
either way could cause a price spike or a sharp price drop 
gold and silver futures fell in reaction to the governments 
report that consumer prices rose 05 percent in march the increase 
was less than the market had expected ms raptopoulos said 
gold settled 140 to 220 lower with the contract for delivery 
in june at 459 a troy ounce silver was 12 cents to 15 cents 
lower with may at 645 a troy ounce 
pork futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange with 
frozen pork bellies up sharply on speculation that cash hog prices 
were bound to improve in coming months while cattle futures 
advanced on higher cash prices analysts said 
live cattle settled 13 cent to 65 cents higher with april at 
7495 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 60 cent higher 
with april at 7930 cents a pound hogs were 20 cent lower to 83 
cent higher with april at 4450 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 30 cent to 130 cents higher with may at 5340 cents a pound 
oil prices continued to slide on the new york mercantile 
exchange amid profittaking and a lack of new developments in the 
persian gulf analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 29 cents 
lower with may at 1774 a barrel heating oil was 37 cent to 55 
cent lower with may at 4931 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
27 cent to 72 cent lower with may at 5142 cents a gallon 
corn and soybean futures settled lower soybeans sharply so 
on the chicago board of trade as rain washed away fears about 
weather damage to crops in the plains states wheat advanced 
slightly 
i think the markets are going through their usual gyrations 
this time of year said walter spilka an analyst in new york 
with smith barney harris upham amp co you get a brief rally on 
weather information then you get a little rain in the corn belt 
and that puts some pressure on the markets just because theyve 
been up a little 
wheat futures were supported by expectatons of new export 
business analysts said 
wheat settled 1 cent to 1 cents higher with may at 315 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent to 1 cents lower with may at 204 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents lower to cent higher with may at 166 
a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 
666 a bushel 
stockindex futures posted slight gains on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for june delivery of the 
standard amp poors stock index settled 60 point higher at 25790

start of the oil boom in 1973 and held it until 1985 fell to fifth 
in 1987 its average income actually fell 07 percent last year to 
17886

when adjusted for inflation which was 44 percent 1987 income 
growth was the smallest since the recession year of 1982 
the state growth rates showed that the nations bicoastal 
economy the phenomena of a healthy economy in the northeast and

industries averaged 18329 a 67 percent increase over 1986 
income in the midatlantic states grew 60 percent to 17538 
the southwest and rocky mountain states plagued by economies

capita income of 13512 in the southwest was only 22 percent 
above 1986 rocky mountain states average income of 13631 was up 
only 36 percent from the previous year 
however rudolph e depass an analyst with the commerce 
department noted that growth is accelerating from extremely low 
levels in the battered southwest and rocky mountain states while 
it is decelerating from higher levels elsewhere 
in 1986 the growth rate had been 09 percent in the southwest 
and 35 percent in the mountain states in new england and 
midatlantic states growth rates were a booming 76 percent and 
65 percent respectively 
wyoming was the only state in addition to alaska in which 
average income declined in 1987 it fell by 01 percent to 12759 
but the shrinkage was not as bad as the 11 percent decline in 1986

bond prices finished higher wednesday for the 
first time in a week as the market overcame some early worries 
about inflation 
the treasurys key 30year bond which has fallen 25 per 1000 
in face amount since last thursday rose point or about 250 
the bonds yield which moves inversely to its price and is an 
important signal of interest rate trends slipped to 9 percent from 
904 percent late tuesday a week ago the bond yielded 873 percent 
bond prices initially sagged after the labor department reported 
a 05 percent jump in march consumer prices the biggest increase 
since january 1987 the advance was larger than most analysts had 
expected and it drove bond prices lower because it provided 
additional evidence that inflation may be accelerating bond 
investors fear inflation because it erodes the value of their 
holdings 
but bond prices reversed course later in the day and headed 
higher 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research for 
the investment firm dean witter reynolds inc said the recent 
decline in bond prices has been so quick and deep that some traders 
felt it may have gone too far for the moment 
he said some traders also saw that a major reason for the strong 
consumer price growth in march was rising clothing costs and 
concluded the surge could be temporary 
without the rise in apparel costs the cpi would have been up 
by 04 percent or so and that is seen as being more manageable 
sullivan said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm 
maturities edged up 132 point intermediate maturities were up by 
between point and point and 20year issues rose point the 
financial information service telerate inc reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer rose 017 to 11052 the shearson lehman hutton 
daily treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement rose 
165 to 115633 
in corporate trading industrials rose point and utilities 
rose point in moderate dealings 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer fell 037 to 27820 
among taxexempt municipal bonds prices edged down point in 
light trading 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose 2 basis points to 582 
percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills rose 2 basis points to 624 percent but year bills 
were unchanged at 662 percent 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 7 percent up from 61316 percent late tuesday 
sullivan said it was unclear whether the rise in the funds rate 
indicated a tightening of the federal reserves money policy 
because wednesday was the end of a reserve reporting period for 
banks the shortterm lending rate often rises sharply on such days 
as financial institutions borrow to meet reserve requirements

including 307000 19831986 chevrolet chevette and pontiac t1000 
small cars the nations largest automaker said wednesday 
the release mechanism on the automatic transmission shift levers 
on the chevette and the t1000 can wear out so that the knob can be 
bumped from drive to reverse while the car is in motion

hoses and the pipes they connect with 
about 8200 198788 spectrum turbo models are being recalled for 
defects that may cause engine fires gm said six underhood fires 
have been reported so far in the cars which are built by isuzu 
motor co in japan 
the fires can occur when an oilandwater mixture builds up in 
an air inlet hose blocking it and causing increased pressure in 
the engine crankcase the pressure can cause oil leaks that can 
result in fires 
dealers will replace an air intake valve that may not be letting 
in enough air allowing the oilandwater mixture to accumulate 
they also will replace the cars fuel tank and the attached fuel 
feed line because of possible corrosion leading to a fuel leak 
gm also is recalling about 3400 1988 buick century pontiac

the reagan administration won a round in 
skirmishing over trade legislation wednesday raising chances that 
lawmakers might still drop plantclosings provisions believed 
certain to draw a veto 
it is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get 
a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law minority 
leader robert h michel rill said following action in the house 
rules committee 
the panel granted michels request for a floor vote friday on 
whether to send the bill back to a housesenate conference 
committee with orders to strip out the controversial provisions 
requiring employers to provide 60day notice of all but the 
smallest plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the reagan administration has been threatening a presidential 
veto over the plantclosings provision and there are substantial 
doubts about whether enough support exists to override such a veto 
lawmakers whose home districts are hungering for such other 
provisions as repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies 
and massive farm subsidies reportedly have been losing enthusiasm 
for anything that would draw a veto 
the measures central provisions streamline the system under 
which the united states imposes import curbs and takes other 
actions to retaliate against trade violations and aid american 
industries threatened by surges in foreign competition 
if michel wins his battle to send the measure back to the 
conference committee a floor vote on the bill itself scheduled 
for thursday afternoon in the house could be delayed 
the democraticcontrolled rules committee was not obliged to 
grant michels request for a vote to send the bill back to the 
conference committee with instructions to strip out the 
laborbacked plantclosings provisions 
but michel aide joanna schneider said she believed concern over 
how a plantclosings veto could have affected the windfall profits 
tax the farm subsidies and a host of other narrow issues might 
well have prompted lawmakers to scuttle the bill on the floor even 
without sending it back to committee 
rules committee meetings are normally fairly quick but 
wednesdays action was delayed for hours because of democratic 
fears that granting michels request would jeopardize the 
plantclosings provision 
the republican leader had sought earlier to delay action on 
grounds of a rule that newly minted legislation should sit for a 
minimum of three days before going to the passage stage on the 
house floor 
in this case we are dealing with a piece of legislation 1000 
pages long and containing some of the most profound changes in us 
trade law in a decade or more michel said in a letter to rules 
committee chairman claude pepper dfla 
we have yet to see the language in this legislation but 
nevertheless you are clearing the way for a vote for it within 24 
hours he said we are not even certain it will be printed in 
time for the floor vote 
the bill itself is expected to pass the house without much 
trouble when the passage vote comes the major question has been 
whether there will be enough votes to sustain a veto if the 
plantclosings provision remains in

the government outlined a program wednesday for 
expanding marketstyle economic reforms while fighting inflation 
the countrys most pressing economic problem 
reform goals for 1988 include introducing competition for 
company management posts and encouraging city dwellers to buy their 
homes 
so far these measures have been introduced only experimentally 
on a small scale 
the program announced by the official xinhua news agency also 
calls for such antiinflation measures as tightening bank credit 
limiting state investment to major civic projects and limiting the 
rapid growth of workers wages and bonuses 
retail prices jumped 11 percent nationwide in the first quarter 
of 1988 compared with a 73 percent increase in 1987 the price 
increases have generated widespread grumbling 
the reform program was devised by the state commission for 
restructuring the economy which drew up the blueprints for chinas 
transformation from a centrally planned economy to one partially 
directed by market forces 
the commission which was headed by the reformist zhao ziyang 
until he took over as head of the communist party last year now is 
led by the new premier li peng 
the plan bears lis stamp in its emphasis on fighting inflation 
and its lack of new reform ideas li lacks zhaos reputation as an 
innovator and is believed to favor stability over rapid change 
xinhua did not carry comment from li on the plan 
the agency said the plan calls for 80 cities including beijing 
and shanghai to reform their housing systems this year a change 
that is likely to generate widespread public opposition 
most urban houses and apartments are owned by the government or 
by workplaces which rent them for nominal fees 
housing reform intended to save the government money calls for 
rents to be increased in line with maintenance costs and for 
tenants to be encouraged to buy their apartments and houses xinhua 
said the change is to be implemented nationwide within five years 
some local governments have said they will initially give 
citizens subsidies to soften the blow of higher rents many chinese 
pay as little as 135 a month for rent 
under the program described wednesday the government will 
expand its policy of letting stateowned enterprises make their own 
economic decisions and will introduce competition in filling 
management posts xinhua said most managers are currently 
appointed by the government 
the program encourages businesses to use most of their profits 
to improve production and to make sure workers incomes do not grow 
faster than productivity 
economists have blamed rising inflation in part on companies 
using profits to give workers big bonuses 
more enterprises will be allowed to issue bonds to the public 
xinhua said enabling them to raise cash while soaking up some of 
the money supply 
it said the government also will issue bonds to the public and 
banks to make up its projected 22 billion deficit for 1988 
government investment will be limited mainly to major road bridge 
and other infrastructure projects 
banks will issue fewer loans and increase their supervision of 
companies that borrow money the agency said

the supreme court on wednesday upheld a law 
requiring municipal or state bonds issued after june 30 1983 to 
be registered before they can be taxexempt 
the justices by a 71 vote ruled that the federal law enacted 
to discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds does 
not violate any states sovereign immunity 
in other cases the court also ruled that 
unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to boycott 
neutral employers against whom the unions have no grievance 
the government may disqualify military veterans who are 
alcoholics from receiving benefits by viewing their condition as 
willful misconduct rather than an uncontrollable disease 
south carolina had challenged the municipal bond registration 
law arguing that it will hurt state and local governments by 
forcing them to chose between two costly alternatives continue to 
issue unregistered bonds for which investors will have their 
interest taxed or pay sizeable registration fees 
state and local governments issue bonds to finance various 
projects such as building roads and schools 
more than half the states had supported south carolinas 
challenge 
the law which took effect july 1 1983 is aimed in part at 
discouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or are 
passed on to an heir while the interest on government bonds is 
exempt from federal income tax the bonds are taxed as gifts or as 
part of an estate 
in passing the law congress mainly intended to crack down on 
the use of such bonds as an untraceable substitute for cash in 
illegal activities and to make it easier to catch criminals who 
deal in stolen or forged securities 
writing for the court today justice william j brennan said 
a nondiscriminatory federal tax on the interest earned on state 
bonds does not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity 
doctrine 
only justice sandra day oconnor dissented accusing the court 
of overturning a precedent that it has honored for nearly a 
hundred years by making state and municipal bonds subject to 
possible federal taxation 
in the union handbill case from florida the court ruled on an 
80 vote that although federal labor law generally prohibits unions 
from engaging in secondary boycott picketing of neutral 
employers it does not ban nonpicketing activities aimed at such 
businesses 
the controversy began when the florida gulf coast building and 
construction trades council a union sought to publicize its 
grievances against the high construction co which was building a 
store in the east lake square mall in tampa 
the union alleged that high offered substandard wages and 
benefits 
rather than picket or patrol the mall union members handed out 
literature urging a total consumer boycott of the 85store mall 
after the union refused to modify the handbills to make clear it 
had no dispute with the malls owner or any of the tenant stores 
the edward j debartolo corp which owns the mall filed an unfair 
labor practice claim against the union 
the national labor relations board ruled that the unions action 
was banned by federal law but the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals said that reading labor law to ban such handbilling would 
raise serious constitutional issues 
by reading federal labor law to allow the unions handbilling 
the justices avoided having to decide the constitutional 
freespeech issue presented by the case 
in a separate decision the court ruled by a 62 vote in a 
california case that forcing employers to provide free internal 
mail delivery for labor union literature aimed at organizing 
employees violates the federal law giving the us postal service a 
monopoly 
the justices reversed a decision by the state public employment 
relations board granting the free mail delivery for local 371 of 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
the union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the 
university of california in 1979 after being denied free use of the 
intercampus mail system at its berkeley campus 
in the alcoholism case the court ruled by a 43 vote that the 
veterans administration in denying benefits to two men did not 
violate a federal law protecting the rights of the handicapped 
the court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease but 
said the va is not compelled to regard it as such
