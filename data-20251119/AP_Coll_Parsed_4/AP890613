in a gesture of reconciliation more 
than four decades after the end of world war ii the soviet union 
has released the names of 1500 german soldiers who died in its 
prisonerofwar camps 
the list was presented to the german red cross to coincide with 
the arrival monday of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
it was the first time the soviets had provided a list of german 
soldiers still unaccounted for after the war west german officials 
said 
thousands of german soldiers died in soviet prisonerofwar camps 
and many prisoners were not released until the early 1950s 
german red cross officials applauded the soviet action saying it 
was a moving gesture of reconciliation and an important first step 
in clarifying the fate of these missing men 
the red cross and another west german group the federation for 
the preservation of german war graves said they hoped to be able to 
inform relatives of the soldiers on the list soon 
the red cross said it hoped that additional lists of missing 
soldiers would follow 
the kremlin has also agreed allow greater access to several 
cemeteries in the soviet union where german soldiers are buried 
german red cross president botho prinz zu saynwittgenstein 
called the soviet gesture a breakthrough in the humantarian 
relations between the two nations 
the bitter legacy of world war ii and the nazi attack on the 
soviet union has clouded west germansoviet relations for decades 
according to official estimates more than 20 million soviets 
were killed in the war and nazi armies destroyed vast areas of the 
soviet union 
soviet prisoners of war were subjected to brutal treatment by the 
nazis and thousands died in forced labor and concentration camps 
until the german defeat in 1945

the countdown has begun at the opera bastille 
some 1500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing 
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open 
july 13 as the french mark the bicentennial of their revolution 
french opera buffs hope the hightech musical complex built on 
the square where revolutionaries stormed the bastille prison on july 
14 1789 will finally put paris on the international music map 
for the moment doubts remain 
the new opera had been leaderless since last january when israeli 
conductor daniel barenboim was fired because of what president 
francois mitterrands representative said were his high fees and 
elitist views on opera 
pierre berge the head of the yves saint laurent fashion empire 
and the man mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final 
days said barenboims replacement would be someone who understood 
the presidents wish to create a modern and popular opera 
accessible to the masses 
five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when 
that someone turned out to be myungwhung chung a 36yearold 
korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist softspoken and 
unemotional the new music director said he would be a team player 
eager to work in harmony and unison with opera bastille 
administrators 
warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting 
that has beset the project from the start he said if there is a 
fight and ill say it publicly right now i wont fight ill just 
leave 
although berge declined to divulge chungs salary he said his 
fiveyear contract requires the maestro be in paris for 27 weeks a 
year for a minimum of 30 performances 
chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on popular 
opera 
popular means the house is full and people are dying to get 
in he said in an interview id like to broaden the operagoing 
public and see more young people and students in the audience 
meanwhile workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural 
concert billed originally as the centerpiece of official 
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before mitterrand 
president george bush and other luminaries 
french conductor georges pretre will conduct the paris opera 
ballet orchestra and chorus with a host of international 
celebrities performing selected arias from wellknown french operas 
the concert will be staged by american director bob wilson the 
longtime darling of the french avantgarde 
the operabastilles first bona fide operatic production is 
scheduled for next february although chung did not reveal the 
program the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself 
the new opera is a hulking mass of polished granite glass and 
stainless steel designed by canadian architect carlos ott critics 
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock looming over the place de 
la bastille in eastern paris the prison was torn down during the 
revolution 
a technical wonder the opera bastille is everything the ornate 
centuryold paris opera is not the palais garnier may be a landmark 
known worldwide for its baroque design and chagalldecorated 
ceiling but it has been inadequate for decades 
the old opera has a scant 1600 seats with unobstructed views and 
virtually no backstage which meant that sets had to be built 
elsewhere dismantled brought in and reconstructed the cost was 
staggering and so were ticket prices 
tickets to the new opera bastille are expected to cost a maximun 
of 250 francs about 40 less than half their cost at the palais 
garnier which from now on will be devoted to ballet 
the opera bastille has 12 stages in all including a main stage 
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to 
the main stage plus five identical stages one level below 
all are fitted with freight elevators electronically controlled 
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire 
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10 
minutes 
michael dittmann the scenic director who drew up the technical 
specifications calls the opera bastille practical not 
sophisticated 
sophisticated means complicated and this building isnt 
complicated he said during a tour of the building its very 
simple its a place where you have a lot of space here we dont 
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between 
performances 
the main stage offers 4300 square feet of space and is 66 feet 
high it is equipped with 9 elevators 72 traps and a movable 
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes 
a bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load 
the ceiling with carpets curtains and other decor without 
monopolizing the stage the ceiling is also designed for storage 
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate 
there is ample space for costumes workshops and storage areas 
connected directly to the main stage the opera bastille is a 
musicians dream with rehearsal rooms galore three for the 
orchestra two for ballet two for the chorus 16 studios for 
singers and 12 for musicians 
while backstage areas are still dusty construction sites the 
main hall itself is nearly ready on a recent visit workmen were 
busy polishing granite pillars washing windows waxing hardwood 
floors and installing cushions 
despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white black 
and gray the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate aided in part 
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of 
japanese pagodas 
dittmann says the halls computeranalyzed acoustics are 
excellent even the halls chairs have been designed with acoustics 
in mind there are small holes which allow the sound to pass through 
when they are empty 
a polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from 
the three metro lines that intersect under the place de la bastille 
if that isnt enough the subway cars themselves will be fitted 
with special rubber tires he said

take a population rejected by society for its 
misdeeds then look the other way when a killer virus takes hold and 
the afflicted complain about cruel treatment and deficient medical 
care thats the impact of aids in prison prisoners are regarded 
as people who dont matter its a double stigma for inmates 
with aids said nick fruedenberg a new york expert on aids 
counseling and education the second story in a threepart ap extra 
series medicine behind bars addresses care and treatment of 
inmates with aids

carmen harris isolated with other female 
alabama prisoners carrying the aids virus feared she would bleed to 
death in her cell 
stitches from routine uterine surgery had torn open but nurses 
on three shifts failed to answer her pleas for help in november 
1987 she said 
they was afraid of the blood they was afraid of catching the 
virus they had a fear of the word aids said ms harris who 
waited 12 hours before she was taken to a hospital near montgomery 
youre treated like an alien like you had the plague she 
said i got sentenced for manslaughter the judge could have just 
as well sentenced me to death row its like being punished for my 
crime and my diagnosis 
behind prison walls aids is a crackling health issue 
some states isolate inmates who have the virus even if they 
havent developed symptoms those in segregation consider it cruel 
confinement to a new death row prison officials defend it as a way 
to contain the virus and protect those infected from harm 
while arguments can be made for segregation nothing excuses the 
failure to provide medical care inmates advocates say yet prisons 
arent equipped to treat the longterm debilitating illnesses 
wrought by aids 
those on the new death row are not getting appropriate medical 
attention they are being condemned to waste away said benjamin 
schatz director of the aids civil rights project of the national 
gay rights advocates they are treated as if infection indicates 
they have done something wrong 
aids has made the job of providing prison health care more 
difficult more hazardous and more expensive said curtis prout 
director of the internship program at harvard medical school 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most commonly transmitted 
during homosexual acts and the sharing of contaminated needles while 
injecting drugs two behaviors common among prisoners 
in the most recent count last october 3136 aids cases had been 
diagnosed among the us prison population of more than 627000 
according to the national institute of justice aids in prison 
increased 60 percent last year as against a 76 percent jump in the 
general population which can pursue highrisk behaviors more freely 
alabama and five other states california georgia nevada 
tennessee and wyoming segregate prisoners who carry the hiv virus 
that causes aids whether or not they have the disease 
prisoners with fullblown aids are segregated in 20 other states 
and 14 states test or will soon start testing all incoming inmates 
for the disease 
federal prisons randomly test 10 percent of incoming inmates and 
all those leaving the system those with aids or the virus are not 
isolated 
mandatory mass screening and segregation of all hivpositive 
inmates is opposed by the national commission on correctional health 
care which sets voluntary standards for health care in prisons it 
favors solutions such as education and changing behaviors that cause 
aids 
alabama inmates who tested positive to the aids virus have 
charged in a class action lawsuit that they receive poor medical 
care and cruel treatment the federal trial began in march 
suits are pending in two other states that segregate inmates 
with aids in connecticut say their medical care is grossly 
inadequate california prisoners assert that the level of their 
medical and psychiatric care is atrocious 
theyre treated like lepers they might as well be wearing a 
scarlet letter theyre shunned ostracized and stigmatized said 
alexa freeman an attorney with the american civil liberties union 
which filed the alabama suit 
there is no logic no rational basis and no medical basis to 
the segregation policy said robert cohen former medical 
director at new york citys rikers island prison and an expert 
medical witness it is only fear and discrimination which gives 
rise to such barbarous actions 
of the 12000 inmates in alabama 138 have tested positive for 
hiv since 1987 all but eight are men 
men are segregated at the limestone correctional facility inside 
dorm 7 where even the exercise yard is cut off from the main yard 
by a 14foothigh chainlink fence topped with razor wire 
the sense of doom is so heavy that inmates call it thunder dorm 
recalling the futuristic city in mad max beyond thunderdome a 
movie about societys collapse after a nuclear holocaust 
inmates eat with wooden ice cream sticks instead of forks and 
spoons meals come on colorcoded trays their dirty laundry goes 
out in red plastic bags so it is washed separately 
they worship apart from other inmates and dont have equal access 
to programs that would allow them to have jobs or earn early parole 
one inmate with the virus was forced to mop the halls behind him 
as he walked others were given surgical masks and made to clean 
telephones with bleach or ammonia swabs after making calls 
the same hysteria on the streets is multiplied in prison 
said alvin bronstein of the aclu 
michael marsh 41 a thief said life in thunder dorm features 
fights knifings and highrisk sex among prisoners who figure 
theyre going to die anyway 
guys would rather be killed here than die from aids they 
hunger for death another way any other way something that would be 
honorable marsh said its like living in the valley of the 
shadow of death if aids dont kill you one of the guys might 
some inmates want to keep the hiv prisoners isolated saying 
those infected would be killed as soon as they got into the yard 
its either we take them out or they take us out said 
stewart hughey 28 a rapist who testified in favor of segregation 
in the alabama case if one of them gets his semen or blood on an 
open cut they just signed your death warrant 
in new york state where aids is the leading cause of death among 
inmates medical care is deficient according to an 18month study 
released last year by the correctional association of new york 
doctors were unfamiliar with aids treatment and detection the 
study said since 1981 more than 500 prisoners have died of aids 
in 25 percent of the cases the disease was not diagnosed until an 
autopsy 
prisoners with aids also have an unusually low survival rate the 
report said 
inmates from new york city who got the disease from dirty needles 
had a mean survival rate of 159 days half that of those in the 
outside community with similar backgrounds 
aids and prison is proving to be a devastating combination 
said cathy potler author of the report imprisonment becomes a 
virtual death sentence

california raisin growers heard it through the 
grapevine that ocean spray plans to market sweetened dried 
cranberries as craisins which they say capitalizes on the 
success of their dancing raisins campaign 
why do they call it a craisin if its a cranberry said clyde 
nef manager of the california raisin advisory board in fresno 
the farmers are upset weve spent millions of dollars in changing 
the image and promoting california raisins this appears to be an 
effort to capitalize on business weve created 
the craisin a registered trademark will be introduced this 
summer in ralston purina cos muesli cereal which already contains 
raisins 
it is red slightly tart and about the same size as a raisin 
ocean spray the plymouthbased cooperative of cranberry growers 
in wisconsin and massachusetts said it will be the first time 
cranberries will be used in cereal 
the company hopes they are someday used in granola cakes 
muffins and other foods 
raisin growers who have spent nearly 8 million this year on 
ads have asked californias attorney general to look into what they 
say is unfair use of the raisin name 
weve spent millions of dollars building the raisin image up as 
a healthy natural fruit of the sun now they put a c in front of 
it and call it a craisin said ernest bedrosian president of the 
national raisin co in fowler calif we made it so popular they 
just want to shirttail on our success 
ocean spray spokesman john lawlor disputed the raisin growers 
claims 
i dont think theres any confusion here he said monday 
its very clear when you say craisins are dried cranberries youre 
not getting a raisin we dont feel its unfair weve taken out the 
trademark its been approved 
ocean spray which last year grossed 781 million from cranberry 
products has steadily diversified over the years 
some raisin growers are convinced the craisin wont prove to be 
much competition raisins they pointed out are merely grapes dried 
in the sun while craisins must be infused with sugar to make them 
palatable 
its just the skin of the cranberry sugar infused and its 
very tart said pete penner vice chairman of the california 
raisin advisory board

he hugs a high school student as 
cameras click away a major newspaper trumpets his erotic aura 
his advance man hobnobs with miami vice heartthrob don johnson 
on live television 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev brought his entourage and 
his charisma into bonn on monday arriving amid enough hoopla for a 
us super bowl or more appropriately a world cup soccer final 
he also brought his penchant for pressing the flesh at unexpected 
times after a state banquet gorbachev bounced from his limousine 
and started shaking hands in a crowd of wellwishers along his route 
to the soviet embassy he was cheered with chants of gorby 
gorby 
the response to his firstever visit here has so far overshadowed 
the reception president bush received when he visited west germany 
two weeks ago 
the two main tv networks have led the way flooding the airwaves 
with hours of shows and documentaries that include everything from 
interviews with gorbachevs school teachers to a germanrussian 
songfest 
on saturday night the soviet governments top spokesman appeared 
on the hit tv show wetten dass a live potpourri mixing 
daredevil stunts celebrity chatter and song numbers 
we should exchange jokes and not rockets said gennady i 
gerasimov drawing wild applause and cheers from the audience in an 
auditorium in the ruhr industrial city of dortmund we want to be 
friends with your country 
the smiling gerasimov who arrived in west germany last week to 
put final touches on the trip preparations also listened 
attentively when actor johnson joined the celebrities 
were in the same boat johnson said shaking gerasimovs 
hand as he noted that neither speaks german 
gorbachev enjoying an improved eastwest climate is looking to 
west german investment and knowhow to help ease a growing economic 
woes at home chancellor helmut kohls government especially wants 
gorbachevs help in mending the split that divided germany into two 
nations after world war ii 
the changed climate between the old foes was obvious after 
gorbachevs arrival on monday at the villa hammerschmidt official 
residence of west german president richard von weizsaecker 
smiling and relaxed gorbachev mingled with invited guests some 
of them ordinary west germans they included a group from the 
heinrich heine classical high school in dortmund 
the kremlin chief suddenly reached out and hugged bielefeld high 
school student annette lang who had greeted him and his wife 
raisa in russian the young woman also gave gorbachev a west german 
pfennig and a soviet kopeck to symbolize friendship 
weizsaecker gently led gorbachev away from his enraptured fans 
gorbachev told the zdf television network he had arrived with 
the best feelings toward west germany 
later a wedge of motorcycle police led the soviet leaders black 
limousine to kohls office gorbachev waved from the open car window 
to a crowd of about 100 people some of whom had been standing in 
the afternoon sun for nearly an hour 
according to a weekend poll conducted by zdf 90 percent of those 
contacted said they trusted gorbachev and his politics of reform and 
disarmament 
gorbachevs rating surpassed that of both bush who received a 58 
percent approval rating and kohl who only received 50 percent 
he has an enormous erotic aura gushed a headline in mondays 
editions of the bild zeitung west germanys most widely read 
newspaper 
the newspaper run by the archconservative springer publishing 
empire added the man who now fascinates germans more than any 
other head of state in the world is arriving this morning 
as gorbachev began his visit red soviet flags fluttered along 
stately adenauer avenue named after the ironwilled chancellor who 
guided the first years of west germany after the havoc of world war 
ii 
konrad adenauer directed his nation toward the west for this 
week at least the nations attention is definitely focused on the

a week after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was 
buried his grave in a dusty field has become a goldendomed shrine 
to which hundreds of thousands of iranians a day make a mass 
pilgrimage in the scorching heat 
they travel from all over the country to keep nightlong vigils 
and touch the temporary monument over the grave of the octogenarian 
patriarch of irans revolution who is rapidly being elevated to the 
pantheon of shiite moslem saints 
many believe khomeinis blessing and protection are bestowed on 
anyone who touches the square monument fashioned from metal 
shipping containers covered in green cloth and topped by the large 
golden dome 
the containers are on metal pillars and a metal grille gilded 
with spray paint allows people to see the grave marble slabs around 
it buried under flowers make the temporary structure resemble the 
tombs of other moslem holy men 
the imam is the greatest man in iranian history said a 
teacher who identified himself only as mohammad and struggled with 
his 6yearold son through the mass of humanity around the shrine 
iranians call khomeini imam or spiritual leader 
he led the people back to our original faith away from the 
materialism of the west the teacher said in fluent english i 
brought the boy here so he can remember this great day 
tell the world how we loved the imam said a whitebearded 
old man he rode on the shoulders of a young man leading chants 
extolling khomeini the idol smasher 
around him women wailed o khomeini our days will never be the 
same without you 
the golden dome sparkling in the sun by day and floodlighted by 
night has become a beacon for followers of the fierceeyed cleric 
whose fundamentalist islamic revolution ended a 2500yearold 
monarchy 
all roads lead to the compound 500 yards square beside the huge 
behesht zahra cemetery 10 miles south of tehran khomeini was buried 
there last tuesday three days after his death to the accompaniment 
of hysterical anguish by 2 million iranians 
shiite moslem zealots most of them poor people who saw khomeini 
as their savior struggle for hours through the crowds to reach the 
shrine officials estimate more than a half million people visit the 
grave every day 
toothless old men from the tehran slums and cities as far away as 
isfahan mashhad and shiraz mingle with women clad in black 
headtotoe chadors babies clutched in their arms 
as the waves of mourners inch closer to the grave men beat their 
heads and breasts with their hands hoarsely chanting verses from 
the koran islams holy book and slogans of loyalty to khomeinis 
teachings 
some flail themselves with steel chains as drums beat slowly a 
traditional ritual during ashura the month of mourning for hussein 
the first shiite spiritual leader and founder of the sect 
fire engines spray water over the crowds to cool them in 
temperatures that reach 104 degrees fahrenheit under a blazing sun 
people arrive in unending thousands in packed buses and trucks 
tractors towing trailers in cars and on motorbikes 
water tankers are parked every few yards for the thirsty throngs 
free iced lemonade and canned soft drinks are provided 
visitors to the grave must walk two miles through open fields 
under a thick cloud of choking dust raised by the constant traffic 
the last halfmile to the square compound marked off by 
10footshipping containers is a nightmare of shoving and jostling 
revolutionary guards in black uniforms herd women to one side of 
the compound to keep them away from the men they wail in mourning 
their shrill lamentations drowning out the mens chants 
prayers chanted by mullahs or moslem clerics blare from 
loudspeakers and blend with the wailing and chants into a numbing 
wall of sound 
state radio and tv broadcast reports from the teeming scene 
almost every hour 
vast crowds pressed into the area the first days after the 
funeral but no one was allowed to visit the grave until friday 
after the compound had been enlarged and the temporary monument 
erected 
authorities have begun a fundraising campaign to finance a 
permanent monument money began pouring in as soon as it was 
announced

chinas current leaders once victims of the 
cultural revolution are raising fears that they may be ushering in 
a new period of political chaos with their own crackdown on dissent 
many chinese say they find strong similarities between the 
crushing of the prodemocracy movement and the leftist ideological 
purges of 196676 when thousands were suppressed by a campaign of 
propaganda arrests and executions 
the government of deng xiaoping who was imprisoned twice during 
the cultural revolution had pledged that there would never be a 
return to the rhetoric and radicalism of the past 
but his government as part of a propaganda campaign to discredit 
the protesters has revived language not heard for more than a 
decade phrases such as counterrevolutionaries and a small 
band of schemers are reappearing in government announcements 
the government is again making stinging criticisms of foreign 
governments and media the voice of america the broadcasts of which 
have been jammed recently has come in for especially tough 
treatment for its coverage of the armys violent crackdown in 
beijing 
already many chinese are refusing to meet with foreign reporters 
as a climate of fear spreads in the capital 
the military which had withdrawn from an active involvement in 
the countrys politics again is playing a critical role during the 
cultural revolution the military intervened often to restore order 
caused by political conflicts 
with the militarys crucial assistance the government is trying 
to round up the organizers of the democratic movement 
during the cultural revolution deng was branded one of chinas 
main capitalist roaders now he is using the techniques of his 
onetime accusers to fight the prodemocracy activists 
the first volley came in april with the publication of an 
editorial that called the student movement chaotic turmoil and 
urged the suppression of its leadership described as a small band 
of schemers chinese sources said the editorial was written on 
dengs command 
it was as if i went back to the 70s said an east european 
diplomat who did his first tour of duty in beijing in the 1970s 
the use of terms like small band of schemers and warning about 
chaotic turmoil are a return to the thinking of the cultural 
revolution in the space of a month china went back 10 years in 
time 
in may the government organized its own demonstrations to 
counter the prodemocracy protests being held in tiananmen square 
workers in state offices were threatened with fines if they didnt 
attend another throwback to cultural revolutionera practices 
those who did attend were rewarded with bread and eggs 
at one government rally an effigy of chinas mostfamous 
dissident fang lizhi was burned 
the government doing that is like something like 20 years ago 
when mao tsetung sent out the red guard that is dangerous 
said fang who has since taken refuge in the us embassy 
on june 3 the government took another page from its past when it 
used violence to clear tiananmen square home to thousands of 
students and their protest for freedom 
on april 5 1976 when hundreds of thousands had gathered to 
commemorate the death of premier chou enlai the police were called 
out to empty the square with sticks and clubs many died in the 
police onslaught 
another similarity is that chinese have been encouraged to inform 
on those who took part in the protests in a modern twist telephone 
numbers of reporting stations were published in beijing newspapers 
one man identified as a rumor monger was reportedly turned 
in two hours after his picture was broadcast on television 
a main difference between the techniques of the cultural 
revolution and todays struggle is that the current campaign has yet 
to extend throughout the nation 
one week into the crackdown there are fears the worst has yet to 
come

acting president manuel solis palma 
met with military strongman gen antonio manuel noriega monday after 
he conferred with an oas mission trying to mediate panamas election 
deadlock 
on its second trip to panama the organization of american states 
mission met separately monday with solis palma and opposition party 
members 
immediatedly after his onehour meeting with oas officials solis 
palma met for another hour with noriega the general was seen 
entering the governmental palace in civilian clothing with carlos 
duque the governments candidate in the may election that was 
annulled 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter told reporters later 
that panamanian officials and the oas representatives were trying to 
find an acceptable formula for a dialogue between the government 
and opposition 
this mechanism even though it obviously doesnt exist yet 
this is what we are searching for ritter said 
noriega did not speak with reporters 
one oas delegate ecuadorean foreign minister diego cordovez 
said earlier he is confident the government and opposition have the 
political will to settle their differences 
he said it is up to the panamanians to resolve the dispute 
the oas only can promote a dialogue and perhaps give ideas 
based on our national experience based on similar situation he 
said 
joao baena soares the oas secretarygeneral and the foreign 
ministers of guatemala and trinidad and tobago are the other members 
of the mission 
panamas political crisis began with the may 7 election which 
international observers said the opposition won by at least a 21 
margin the government controlled by noriega annulled the election 
and opposition candidates were attacked and beaten by his supporters 
the oas then agreed to send the mission to negotiate a national 
dialogue on the transfer of power on sept 1 as required by the 
constitution 
on their first visit to panama at the end of may the oas 
diplomats could not persuade the opposition and government to hold 
direct talks opposition leaders said they would talk only with 
noriega and he refused 
cordovez a former un official who negotiated the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan was optimistic monday 
i think there is a political will in the government and the 
opposition that has to be translated into specific steps he said 
it seems to me that it is most urgent to establish mechanisms that 
allow panamanians to talk and negotiate 
noriega and government officials blame panamas problems on the 
united states which they say wants to renege on 1977 treaties that 
turn over the panama canal to panama at the end of the century 
noriega commander of panamas defense forces was indicted on 
drug trafficking charges last year in the united states he denies 
the charges and has refused us demands he resign

a sightseeing plane that vanished between the 
islands of hawaii and maui with 11 people aboard may have sent out 
an emergency signal monday but foul weather prevented rescuers from 
searching for it 
theres an emergency signal coming from valley and we think it 
could be the plane said coast guard spokesman keith spangler 
but the weathers so bad helicopters cant go in and otherwise 
its about a 10hour hike 
a coast guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitters 
signal from the remote waimanu valley region of the island which is 
on the northwest end of the island and within the missing planes 
flight path spangler said 
the valley had no vehicular access he said adding that no 
decision had been made whether to dispatch searchers to hike in 
were getting all our information together and seeing if the 
weather will let up spangler said heavy rain and low clouds 
persisted in the area monday 
the scenic air tours hawaii plane disappeared sunday on what was 
to be have been an hourlong flight 
a coast guard cutter coast guard helicopter and seven civil air 
patrol planes searched 1279 square miles of ocean said coast guard 
spokesman scott hartvigsen police on hawaii and maui islands also 
checked areas where tour aircraft fly he said 
air strips also were checked in case the pilot landed without 
informing the federal aviation administration said faa spokesman 
george harvey 
the twinengine beechcraft carrying a pilot and 10 tourists had 
left hilo airport for kahului airport and headed up hawaii islands 
coast under partly sunny skies disappearing without any indication 
of trouble officials said 
the planes last reported position according to faa radar was 
about 10 miles north of hilo flying along hawaiis northeast coast 
hartvigsen said its altitude at that point was not known harvey 
said 
harvey said investigators suspect that if the plane went down it 
is in the area of that last radar fix because it was passing out of 
radar coverage and if it had gone further it likely would have been 
picked up by another radar station 
the sky over the area was partly sunny with low scattered clouds 
no rain and 15 to 20 mph wind at the time the plane disappeared the 
national weather service said the plane took off about 115 pm 
and was to have landed at kahului at 230 pm officials said 
alenuihaha channel which the plane would have had to cross to 
get to maui had 5 to 6foot seas at the time 
the last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an faa 
ground station that he had taken off from hilo for maui harvey said 
the plane was on a sixisland tour said company owner doris tom 
the passengers had taken a ground tour of the erupting kilauea 
volcano before leaving hilo she said 
most of those aboard are americans and two are from australia 
but the names are not being released because not all the families 
have been notified said david tom the operations manager for the 
tour company 
in 1987 a twinengine panorama air tours plane with eight people 
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from honolulu to 
molokai island

three new york art dealers set up a sting with 
the fbi that led to the recovery of nine old master paintings stolen 
from a swiss art gallery and three arrests according to a televised 
report 
the nine paintings worth more than 5 million were stolen along 
with 12 other old masters on april 12 from the koster gallery in 
zurich by three men who tied up a gallery employee at gunpoint fbi 
agent thomas pickard told the art market report a weekly financial 
news network program that aired monday night 
the theft and arrests were disclosed for the first time on the 
cable television station 
swiss police did not announce the theft hoping the robbers would 
try to sell the paintings if it was not publicized that they were 
stolen said richard schillay one of the three art dealers who run 
a gallery in manhattan 
a week after the theft a man called schillay from paris and told 
him he had an important collection he wanted to sell in the united 
states 
schillay and his partners at the schillay amp rehs inc gallery 
joseph and howard rehs became suspicious when the man could not 
explain why he wanted to sell the paintings here and not in europe 
the man also went through a whole grandiose story about how 
important his family was in our dealings here in the gallery 
we meet a number of people of wealth and virtually none of them 
present themselves in this manner said schillay 
the man also could not answer questions about the condition of 
the paintings estimated the worth of one painting at 500000 when 
it was actually worth 15 million and made no inquiries about the 
gallerys background as is customary for sellers to do the dealers 
said 
a man who claimed to be the sellers son brought the paintings to 
new york and later the seller came too schillay amp rehs had several 
experts examine the paintings and they were found to be genuine old 
masters 
eventually schillay came across an expert who had heard of a 
theft of old masters from a koster gallery the tip led schillay to 
contact a london dealer who often invests in works at the koster 
the london man confirmed that the paintings were stolen 
schillay amp rehs then called the fbi on may 1 two fbi agents 
posing as employees of schillay amp rehs arrested the seller rene de 
grove thierry houze the man who had posed as his son and a woman 
martine wins according to schillay 
pickard the fbi agent who set up the sting said the trio were 
being held without bail in the metropolitan correctional center 
awaiting indictment on charges of possession of stolen goods and 
bringing stolen goods into the country 
one of the gunmen in the heist is still at large schillay said 
the other 12 paintings stolen in zurich were not recovered but 
schillay said de grove was negotiating turning them over in exchange 
for being transferred to a swiss prison 
the paintings recovered were stilllifes landscapes portraits 
and other 17th and 18thcentury dutch and french paintings most of 
them 7 by 9 inches or smaller by the following artists jan david 
de heem marten ryckaert jan meartens jan steen louise moillou 
s von reysdael dirk hals adrien coorte and cornelius de heem 
schillay said

the justice department said for the first time 
monday night that rep william h gray iii dpa is not the target 
of a criminal investigation 
the department statement backed up what gray and his lawyer said 
they have been told by fbi agents ever since word leaked out last 
month that gray had been visited by two fbi agents on memorial day

in the house of representatives for the post of majority whip the 
thirdranking leadership position among democrats gray is 
contending with two others for the job 
congressman gray is not the target of a criminal investigation 
by the department of justice congressman gray and his office have 
been fully cooperating with the department of justice and the fbi 
said a statement read by spokesman dan eramian

authorized his executive assistant robert s ross jr to make the 
statement 
eramian declined to answer questions on why the statement was 
issued monday night 
government sources speaking earlier on condition that they not 
be identified said the department had opened a preliminary 
investigation into whether gray had a noshow employee on his 
staff 
gray said from the outset he knew of no such employees and 
members of his staff have said since that they had found no evidence 
of one 
in a statement issued monday after the departments gray said 
i have said from the beginning that i am not a target and this 
confirms it i have said from the beginning that i and my staff have 
cooperated full and this confirms it i have done nothing wrong and 
this too will be confirmed 
jon plebani grays chief of staff said he had been told that 
the justice department decided to issue the statement because 
reports about the investigation of grays office have done 
congressman gray a serious disservice and have inappropriately been 
a factor in the whip contest

fighting between christian and syrian 
forces has paralyzed the american university of beirut the middle 
easts most prestigious academic institute and much of the rest of 
lebanons educational system 
but senior university officials are bent on reopening as soon as 
they can the seaside facility that has given the arab world at least 
three presidents 10 prime ministers and more than 100 cabinet 
ministers and ambassadors 
acting president ibrahim salti contends the university will 
resume classes 48 hours after the latest round of fighting stops in 
lebanons 14yearold civil war

children grownups even the monkeys and apes 
stare up at sculptor steven weitzman as he transforms a 28foot tree 
stump at the national zoo into a mirror of the exotic life around 
him 
using chainsaw drill mallets and chisels from his scaffolding 
weitzman is sculpting a tribute to zoo volunteers from the barren 
trunk of a nearly centuryold willow oak that was chopped down last 
year because it was dying he found the stump lying abandoned near a 
creek in the zoo 
weitzman 36 a native of boulder colo who came to washington 
by way of los angeles has been working since last august to convert 
the trunk into a work of art honoring those who maintain our 
extended family the flora and fauna of the planet 
he already has inhabited the upper reaches of the stump with a 
miniature zoo among the carved figures are a swooping american bald 
eagle a scowling orangutan a contented panda great blue heron 
water lizard tree shrew fish squirrel and a giraffe nibbling 
greenery offered by the outstretched hand of a young man 
can you find the tree frog weitzman asks passersby its 
crawling out of its hole just below the black palm cockatoo 
operating on a 20000 commission from the national zoo and its 
volunteer organization friends of the national zoo weitzman works 
almost daily except when it rains in the hope of finishing his 
sculpture by the end of october 
his studio is a fencedin plot on the sundrenched lawn facing 
the zoos reptile and monkey houses the tourists swarming below 
arent simply gawkers weitzman occasionally invites someone to 
mount the scaffolding to model an ear or nose for the human figure 
he is carving 
early on weitzman got some helpful kibitzing from a denizen of 
the zoos nearby monkey island 
i was trying to carve an eagle but the tree was saying no 
this wont work he said i wrestled with it for two or three 
days cussing at myself but it was not becoming an eagle it just 
got worse and worse 
then i had the feeling something was watching me i looked over 
my shoulder and there was a barbary ape sitting over there with his 
hands on his knees staring at me so i forgot the eagle and carved 
him looking back at himself 
with a friendly eyes and a smile as wide as his mustache 
weitzman encourages his spectators to step forward grab a chisel 
and make their own artistic imprint 
one of my aims is to dispel the illusion that artists are a 
unique branch of humanity to show the public that creating a piece 
of art work is not beyond most peoples ability he said 
people say aw youre so lucky i wish i could carve like 
that i say come up here confront your fears and ill show you how 
to do it 
three hours later theyre still carving they say wow i can 
do it weitzman says 
its all about pursuing your dreams my dream is to do this 
sculpture out of a fiveton tree stump yours might be singing 
dancing writing painting crocheting everyone has something to 
communicate what it takes is tenacity pursuing it with all of 
your heart 
if you work your butt off if you work really hard you can do 
it maybe it wont be the best in the world but so what

virginians vote today in a republican 
primary to choose an opponent for l douglas wilder the democratic 
nominee seeking to making history as the nations first elected 
black governor 
polls show a deadlock in the gop contest among former us sen 
paul s trible jr former attorney general j marshall coleman and 
us rep stanford e parris todays primary is the first gop 
gubernatorial primary in the state since 1949 
wilder the states lieutenant governor was nominated saturday 
at a unified state democratic convention he and his running mates 
businessman donald s beyer jr for lieutenant governor and mary sue 
terry for reelection as attorney general launched a statewide tour 
monday 
all 26 million registered voters can participate in the primary 
because virginia does not have registration by party but turnout in 
the super tuesday presidential primary in march 1988 was only 
235000 on the gop side 
trible 42 had led all polls until last week but two surveys 
published as coleman turned 47 on thursday put him about even with 
trible parris 59 was was close enough to the leaders to fall 
within the polls sampling errors 
a poll released last week showed each of the three gop contenders 
leading wilder but only slightly wilder 58 is nurturing his 
image as an underdog a tactic which helped parlay him into the 
lieutenant governorship in 1985 
a grandson of slaves wilder grew up in segregated richmond and 
attended howard university law school in washington on a state 
stipend because he could not go to virginias allwhite law schools 
he has portrayed himself as a social moderate and fiscal 
conservative and has played down the racial aspect of the contest 
as have the three gop contenders 
the nation has not had a black governor since reconstruction and 
has never actually elected one lt gov pinckney pinchback of 
louisiana became acting governor in 187273 after gov henry

the wife of house ethics committee chairman 
julian dixon earned over 150000 in two years from an investment of 
less than 15000 in companies that help run stores at los angeles 
international airport 
airport officials are looking into the two companies to determine 
whether they qualified properly as minority contractors although 
they had identical boards of directors one was listed as a minority 
enterprise while another was listed as being run by women 
on monday dixon amended his 1986 financial disclosure form to 
show that his wife betty paid between 5000 and 15000 for the 
investment in the companies 
dixon dcalif initially told the associated press he did not 
have to reveal how much mrs dixon paid for the highyield 
investment because she owned no stock in the california companies 
mir kanon inc and peideau inc 
but he told the house clerk in a letter monday that upon recent 
review of the companies articles of incorporation it appears 
that technically betty is deemed a stockholder 
in this light her acquisition of interest in mir kanonpeideau 
in july 1986 also should have been reflected in the transaction 
section dixon said 
he said in a telephone interview he was sorry that i made that 
mistake of not disclosing the cost of the investment obviously 
i feel badly about it 
dixons forms from 1986 showed that mrs dixons investment was 
worth between 100000 and 250000 thus the investment appears to 
have soared after she paid between 5000 and 15000 for it in july 
1986 
mrs dixon invested in mir kanon and peideau three months after 
the companies were part of a joint venture awarded the concession to 
run dutyfree stores at the worlds thirdbusiest airport 
dixon who gained prominence in presiding over the ethics 
committee probe that ended with the resignation of speaker jim 
wright said in a telephone interview that the california investment 
has been better than we ever expected 
mrs dixon received dividends of over 100000 in 1988 and of 
between 50000 and 100000 in 1987 according to financial forms 
disclosed for those years 
dixon said there was nothing improper about his wifes business 
arrangement and that she was the ideal person to sit on the 
companies boards because she has a background in retailing her 
washington business much ado about something inc distributes 
advertising novelties 
as a member of both companies boards mrs dixon said she 
attends meetings and helps set corporate policy i dont have a 
job there not a 9to5 job she said 
los angeles airport officials are checking to see if the 
companies meet requirements to qualify as minority contractors 
glenn kroh the airports property manager said he has uncovered 
nothing illegal or immoral about the multimilliondollar 
concession business 
donald miller the airports deputy executive director said 
officials want to make sure they are a bona fide minority business 
enterprise and womens business enterprise 
when airport commissioners awarded the dutyfree concession 
miller said mir kanon was classified as a minority enterprise 
while peideau was classified as a business run by women 
but california records show the companies had identical boards of 
directors on sept 28 1988 they also had the same agent who 
listed the same address in culver city calif 
that is not the way it was proposed to us originally miller 
said 
however he said airport officials knew from the beginning there 
was overlapping ownership in mir kanon and peideau in that 
prominent atlanta businessmen jesse hill jr president of atlanta 
life insurance inc herman j russell a contractor and felker 
ward an attorney own part of the businesses 
dixon who also a member of the house appropriations committee 
said his wifes highyield investment has never affected his 
decisions in congress 
im sure ive supported bills that have supported the 
airport said dixon whose congressional district abuts the 
airport i dont recall any specific requests that ive made to 
members nor have i contacted the federal aviation administration 
dixons revision came as the finances of congressional spouses 
are in the spotlight because of wrights resignation after being

president raul alfonsin said 
monday night he will resign on june 30 nearly six months before the 
scheduled transfer of power but presidentelect carlos menem said 
thats too soon 
menem and his peronist party defeated alfonsins centrist radical 
civic union bloc in may 14 national elections and the inauguration 
of the new president and congressional winners was scheduled for 
dec 10 
alfonsin 62 said in a 15minute broadcast to the nation that 
argentinas disastrous economy forced his resignation interest 
rates and unemployment have approached record levels and at least 11 
people were killed late last month in food riots and looting 
i have decided to resign effective june 30 1989 the post of 
president of argentina alfonsin said 
vice president victor martinez also will resign on june 30 he 
said 
two hours after alfonsins address menem issued a statement 
saying it was impossible for him to take office on june 30 and 
criticized the unilateral decision by alfonsin 
the statement read by the news secretary of la rioja province 
adrian freijo said menem had no alternative but to allow the 
senate president eduardo menem to act as interim president as 
called for in the constitution 
carlos menem 58 is governor of la rioja eduardo menem is his 
brother 
earlier alfonsin representative rodolfo terragno told reporters 
in buenos aires that menem said he would take over in august at the 
earliest 
menem had said in a radio interview earlier in the day that june 
30 seemed to me to be too fast to take over 
in his speech alfonsin said the accord he sent to menem until 
now only has my signature 
he said the document includes his pledge to support the peronist 
economic program help renegotiate the foreign debt and cooperate 
in investigating any alleged wrongdoing by his administration 
earlier interior minister juan carlos pugliese announced the 
electoral college will convene june 21 more than seven weeks ahead 
of schedule to confirm menems presidency 
alfonsin could not run for reelection under the constitution 
and his partys presidential nominee eduardo angeloz was defeated 
by menem 
in an interview monday cesar jaroslavsky president of the 
radical civic union deputies in congress said the final obstacles 
to a handover were worked out in weekend talks with the peronists 
its just not possible to govern the country under these 
circumstances jaroslavsky said there is no other mechanism 
than to speed up the transfer of power 
the two parties apparently resolved that congress which in 1983 
set dec 10 as the transition date will set the new date and that 
radical legislators will support peronist legislative projects 
similar talks were cut short three weeks ago because they could 
not agree how to stabilize argentinas economy alfonsin wanted to 
raise rates for public services to balance the budget menem 
rejected that as antipopular 
menem wants the new congress to take office the same day he does 
because peronists won virtual control of both houses in the may 14 
balloting 
peronists reportedly are considering issuing a new currency to 
replace the devalued austral setting a high exchange rate to spur 
exports and curtail imports and granting big wage increases to ease 
social tensions and generate demand 
a final stumbling block appears to be an issue that has stymied 
alfonsin since his dec 10 1983 inauguration trials of officers 
accused of human rights violations during the 197683 military 
regimes dirty war on leftists 
at least 8961 argentines vanished after being arrested by 
security forces and are presumed executed according to a commission 
appointed by alfonsin human rights groups say the actual number may 
be two or three times as high 
menem clearly wants alfonsin to settle the issue by ending the 
trials alfonsin had half a dozen officers prosecuted and then 
cleared hundreds of others

ranging from a gocart to presleys favorite stutz bearcat 
many of the vehicles were kept until last year under a backyard 
carport at graceland and they had fallen into serious disrepair 
said brian hughes of classic car co of memphis 
even the 1955 pink cadillac that presley gave his mother was in 
rough shape said hughes whose company restored the vehicles for 
the museum like many of the display vehicles the caddy had to be 
stripped to its frame and rebuilt he said

including plans to join outside investors to open an elvis museum in 
england managers of the presley estate also expect to take part in

president bush has redefined the debate in 
congress over clean air and taken a leap forward in convincing 
environmentalists that while he may not be one of them hes not the 
enemy either 
to many environmentalists the significance of bushs 
threepronged proposal monday to clean up the nations dirtiest air 
is that it came forcefully from the white house along with a clear 
acknowledgement by the president that air pollution is putting 
millions of americans at risk 
this is in sharp contrast to the eight years president reagan 
occupied the white house reagan did not acknowledge acid rain as 
being an environmental concern and viewed tougher laws to curb urban 
smog and toxic industrial chemicals as excessive government 
regulation 
with republicans in congress rallying around the bush clean air 
package the political chemistry is going to change dramatically 
and the debate will center on finding a middle ground between the 
white house bill and more stringent democratic versions said jay 
hair president of the wildlife federation 
the republicans are now going to be in the bidding game on 
environmental issues agreed fred krupp executive director of the 
environmental defense fund he said the bush package will serve as 
a vehicle thats going to drive this issue through congress 
we no longer need to debate what the goals will be suggested 
paul pritchard president of the national parks and conservation 
association david gardiner legislative director of the sierra 
club said the bush proposal will definitely break the logjam 
that is not to say the power picture in congress has not also 
changed significantly from the reagan years and likely will be just 
as important 
sen george mitchell dmaine sponsor of an acid rain bill last 
year is now senate majority leader he succeeded sen robert byrd 
dwva who for years has been a staunch opponent of any 
legislation that might harm the highsulfur coal industry in his 
state 
public opinion polls also have told congress and the president 
that the voters are keenly interested in removing the yellowish smog 
from urban areas want to be protected against the release of toxic 
industrial chemicals into the air and approve of curbs on acid rain 
which is destroying lakes streams and forests hundreds of miles 
from the tall stacks of coalburning power plants 
such is the mood that rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
energy and commerce committee who in the past has blocked clean air 
legislation opposed by the auto industry responded to the bush 
package by saying the broad outlines appear reasonable 
to be sure there are provisions and details of bushs clean air 
package that brought criticism and uncertainty from the 
environmental community at the same time it was characterized as 
trying to move too far too fast by the coal industry 
despite those industry complaints bushs proposal to cut sulfur 
dioxide emissions from coal burning power plants in half by the year 
2000 a key to curtailing acid rain prompted widespread praise 
it was more than many environmentalists had expected 
the president basically sided with those in the administration 
who wanted a stronger proposal said george frampton of the 
wilderness society alluding to reports of sharp disagreement among 
some bush advisers over details of package 
so while environmentalists continue to chide bush for his slow 
response to the alaska oil spill tragedy and criticize him for a 
handful of midlevel appointments involving public lands and parks 
they also suggest that there is growing evidence his commitment to 
protecting the environment may not be purely rhetoric 
they see the bush clean air proposal as the clearest sign of that 
so far 
i believe the environment won today a beaming william k 
reilly head of the environmental protection agency told reporters 
after briefing them on the white house proposal

president bush has won praise for proposing the 
clean air package his predecessor wouldnt touch but he faces 
division over provisions on acid rain airborne toxic chemicals and 
auto emissions 
i think he got an a for effort richard ayres chairman of 
the national clean air coalition said monday after bush announced 
his proposal hes heading in the right direction 
ayres reaction was typical of the praise that flowed from 
environmentalists industry spokesmen and lawmakers viewing bushs 
proposals as generally positive they nonetheless took issue with 
particulars 
ayres for example said he was concerned the plan put too much 
emphasis on new cleaner fuels rather than cleaning pollution from 
existing gasoline engines 
much criticism also came from groups with vested financial 
interests who said bush went too far the coal industry and 
officials from mining states for instance predicted utility 
customers would pay for the switch to lowsulfur coal 
senate majority leader george mitchell summed up the remarks of 
many when he called bushs plan a significant departure from the 
negative environmental policy of the reagan administration which 
opposed every cleanair bill considered by congress for the past 
eight years 
mitchell dmaine was chief sponsor of the major clean air bill 
last year and his elevation to majority leader this year has led to 
numerous predictions of an end to a decadelong congressional 
gridlock 
bush alluded as well to the previous inertia 
too many americans continue to breathe dirty air and political 
paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution he 
said weve seen enough of this stalemate its time to clear the 
air 
the proposal would attempt to leave most cities free of urban 
smog by the year 2000 and to sharply reduce acid rain pollution 
bush recommended that automakers be required to build and sell 
methanolpowered cars in nine urban areas plagued by dirty air he 
proposed that limits on tailpipe emissions of ozoneproducing 
hydrocarbons in existing cars be tightened by almost 40 percent 
a proposed 10million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide from 
coalburning power plants a major cause of acid rain would mean a 
50 percent cut in these deadly emissions 
and bush said industry should be required to use new technology 
to curb the release of cancercausing toxic chemicals into the air 
the most critical voices came from the national coal association 
and sen robert c byrd dwva byrd said the acid rain provisions 
would unfairly penalize the highsulfur coal areas like his state 
by leading to massive switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur 
coal 
richard l lawson president of the national coal association 
called some provisions unnecessary unduly harsh and economically 
onerous and warned that electric ratepayers will likely pay more 
for electricity 
bush chief of staff john sununu said the stiffer standards would 
add 5 percent to 10 percent to utility rates in 18 states that burn 
high sulfur coal and contribute the most to the acid rain problem 
but he said their rates would still fall below the national average 
the clean air working group representing 1950 companies and 
associations said it recognized the innovative positive ideals 
in bushs plan 
but the group said the alternative motor vehicle fuels plan was 
excessive and agreed with the coal industry that utilities under 
the bush plan would be unwilling to spend money on new clean coal 
technology 
the technology would not achieve results until 2005 according to 
the coal industry too late to meet the year 2000 deadline for 
reducing sulfur dioxide 
sen alan cranston dcalif called the bush plan a welcome 
departure from the reagan administrations lack of action but 
added i do not think the proposal goes far enough in controls 
on mobile sources motor vehicles which are the single largest 
source of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution 
the tailpipe emission standards in force today are standards 
established in the clear air act of 1970 
but tim maccarthy director of federal liaison of the motor 
vehicle manufacturers assocation including the big three us 
carmakers said we dont support tougher tailpipe emissions 
standards 
he said the retirement of older cars increased emissions 
inspection and maintenance programs and pilot projects on 
alternative fuels are a much better idea 
but he said there is a very good likelihood there will be some 
tightening of tailpipe standards 
sen max baucus dmont the chief sponsor of clean air 
legislation in the senate this year said the rhetoric is good 
but its a bit vague in the urban smog provisions 
david gardiner of the sierra club called the air toxics part of 
the bill the weakest portion of the proposal he said industry 
would not have to use the best possible technology to reduce toxic 
emissions and predicted the bush standards will not make a dent 
in the problem 
william reilly chief of the environmental protection agency 
said cleaning the air will neither be free nor easy for 
example electric bills are expected to increase by 2 percent in 
some states to clean up coalfired electric plants 
at a briefing before bushs speech reilly estimated the overall 
program would cost between 14 billion and 19 billion a year after 
it is in full effect at the turn of the century

donald gregg has been assured hes not a target 
for possible prosecution in the irancontra affair a state 
department official says but greggs appointment as ambassador to 
south korea still faces an uphill climb in the senate 
the administration has no interest is appointing as ambassadors 
individuals who are the targets of grand jury investigations the 
state departments chief legal adviser abraham d sofaer said in a 
letter to sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee 
mr gregg would withdraw from consideration if his conduct was 
so regarded by a federal prosecutor said the letter made 
available monday this has never been the case however and it is 
not so today 
the committee has delayed greggs confirmation while it 
investigates allegations that while serving as vice president bushs 
national security adviser in the reagan administration gregg helped 
in the illegal resupply of the nicaraguan contra rebels 
sen alan cranston dcalif who has spearheaded the committees 
investigation of gregg has said he finds greggs firm denials of 
such activity hard to accept 
sofaer said independent counsel lawrence e walsh told gregg that 
he was a subject of the irancontra investigation being 
conducted by walsh but not a target 
the united states attorneys manual describes a subject as a 
person whose conduct is within the scope of a grand jurys 
investigation sofaer said 
a target is described as a person to whom a prosecutor or 
the grand jury has substantial evidence linking himher to the 
commission of a crime 
under longstanding practice a target who is a witness before 
a grand jury is warned that his conduct is being investigated for 
possible violation of federal criminal law sofaer said 
when mr gregg testified before the grand jury he was informed 
that he was not a target and was not told that his conduct was 
being investigated for possible violation of federal criminal law 
he said 
speculation that the grand jury might be preparing to indict 
gregg on perjury charges stemmed from walshs noncommittal reply 
when asked by cranston whether gregg was a target of the irancontra 
probe 
in that reply dated june 1 walsh said it is accurate that the 
investigation extends to perjury and false statements before the 
irancontra hearings as evidenced by the indictment of retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord 
walsh said his office had made no statement about gregg and was 
unable to comment further at this time 
under an agreement between cranston and republican members of the 
committee who contend gregg is being subjected to an unfair ordeal 
of delay and leaks gregg will be questioned under oath at a 
second investigative hearing on thursday 
cranston has said he will permit the full committee to vote on 
the gregg nomination on june 20

reporters roundly criticized an effort by 
columnist jack anderson to test security at the capitol by smuggling 
in a gun an action that could also lead to criminal charges and 
revocation of his media pass 
this was jack anderson making a quick buck bob franken of 
cable news network said monday he called andersons action a 
trivialization of journalism 
al freeman of mutual broadcasting called andersons technique a 
stunt 
freeman said someone such as anderson a nationally syndicated 
columnist is known and might have an easier time getting into the 
capitol without as thorough a check as lesserknown individuals 
but anderson said monday that he did not carry the gun into the 
building himself because he realized there was a possibility he 
would be recognized and therefore not checked as carefully as a 
person not known to security officers 
he said the accomplice who carried the weapon was with his party 
but went in far enough ahead of me i dont think that person would 
have been associated with me the accomplice was not named 
franken praised the capitol police for carrying out the difficult 
task of providing security while allowing people access to their 
elected representatives 
those are opposing philosophies said officer dan nichols 
spokesman for the capitol police the building draws 20000 visitors 
daily he said 
nichols said police and the us attorney for the district of 
columbia are investigating whether to file criminal charges against 
anderson in connection with the may 24 incident 
anderson pulled the pistol out of his pocket while taping an 
interview about terrorism with sen minority leader bob dole 
rkan in the senators office 
the columnist could be charged with possession of a gun inside 
the capitol a felony punishable by a 5000 fine five years in 
jail or both lesser charges also are being considered nichols said 
additionally the committee that hands out media credentials is 
considering revoking andersons privileges 
for us the issue is narrow did he abuse his position as a 
reporter said wall street journal reporter jeffrey birnbaum 
chairman of the committee which credentials about 2000 daily print 
journalists 
he said the fivemember committee could take away andrsons 
credentials reprimand him or do nothing after a hearing that has 
not yet been scheduled 
in an informal survey reporters who cover congress regularly 
expressed nearly unanimous displeasure for andersons act 
kenan block a producer for macneillehrer newshour said he did 
a similar story on airport security when he was reporting for a 
local station 
its a cheap shot he said its kind of a cliche i 
thought anderson would do a more sophisticated story 
senate mjority leader george mitchell dmaine and dole have 
threatened to require more timeconsuming searches of the media if 
the credentials committee doesnt deter any future repetition of 
this act

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has taken 
the lessons of the cuban missile crisis to heart changing his 
government to reduce chances of a superpower confrontation say us 
veterans of the incident 
over the past two years gorbachev has authorized disclosure of 
reams of new information on the 1962 crisis said raymond garthoff 
a former us diplomat who played a role in the crisis and has 
written a book on it 
at a seminar on his book garthoff said the soviets have decided 
the crisis stemmed from a decision reached by thensoviet leader 
nikita s khrushchev to send nuclear missiles to cuba without 
adequate consultation with other members of the politburo 
like the afghan invasion it is seen as an error caused by 
having too few people involved in a decision said garthoff who 
revised an earlier book on the basis of new soviet disclosures 
garthoff is now a scholar at the brookings institution 
the decision to invade afghanistan in december 1979 was made by 
thensoviet president leonid i brezhnev and a handful of politburo 
members according to other soviet disclosures the soviets withdrew 
their forces from afghanistan this year 
robert mcnamara who was the american defense secretary during 
the cuban missile crisis said gorbachevs close attention to the 
incident shows his sensitivity to the dangers that nuclear 
weapons pose 
garthoff and mcnamara interpreted many of the reforms proposed by 
gorbachev such as enhancing the presidency giving more power to 
the soviet parliament and publishing reports on meetings of the 
ruling politburo as efforts to expand the number of people involved 
in decisionmaking 
mcnamara like garthoff has taken part in a series of 
ussoviet meetings on the missile crisis including one in moscow 
last january attended by andrei gromyko who was foreign minister at 
the time of the crisis and by anatoly dobrynin who was the soviet 
ambassador to washington at the time 
dobrynin angered us officials during the crisis by telling them 
that there were no soviet nuclear missiles in cuba 
dobrynin assured participants at the conference in moscow last 
january that he had not known about the missiles and gromyko 
confirmed that according to mcnamara who also took part in the 
seminar 
gromyko leaned across the conference table cracking a rare 
smile and said i thought i told you on the way to the airport 
no you didnt dobrynin replied according to mcnamara 
us officials at the time had aerial photographs showing launch 
pads for soviet ss4 and ss5 missiles capable of reaching the 
united states but could not confirm that the warheads had been sent 
to cuba 
recent soviet disclosures have revealed that 20 nuclear warheads 
were in cuba and that 20 more were en route aboard the poltava a 
soviet freighter turned back by the naval quarantine that president 
john f kennedy ordered around the caribbean island during the 
crisis according to garthoff 
recent soviet disclosures have unraveled many mysteries of the 
missile crisis including the decision to down a us u2 spy plane 
over cuba at the height of the crisis said garthoff 
col gen dmitri volkogonov chief of the soviet institute of 
military history told garthoff in an interview that the decision 
was made by two soviet generals in cuba and was not cleared by their 
superiors 
the downing of the american spy plane caused khrushchev shock 
and dismay grathoff said soviets told him recently 
although soviet officials have been speaking more openly of the 
crisis said garthoff they have not yet declassified any internal 
documents from that era in contrast to the american government 
which has released thousands of pages of such material 
among the disclosures from the declassified us material was 
that us fighters sent to rescue another u2 that wandered 
inadvertently over soviet territory were armed with nucleartipped 
genie antiaircraft missiles said garthoff and mcnamara 
the presence of the genie missiles was disclosed previously in a 
book by scott sagan moving targets also based largely on 
declassified us documents

hungarian cardinal josef mindszenty hid out for 15 years at the 
us embassy in budapest tenthousand cubans once sought refuge on 
the grounds of the peruvian embassy now chinese dissident fang 
lizhi is holed up in the us embassy in beijing 
all have taken advantage of the right of foreign embassies long 
secured in diplomatic law to grant protection to dissidents and 
defectors from the countries where they are located 
sometimes an embassys granting of refuge can provide an easy 
way out for everyone in a political conflict foreign missions have 
been used as a convenient conduit especially in latin america to 
quickly get toppled leaders and their relatives out of the country 
after a revolution 
but far more often the granting of embassy refuge to opponents 
of the host government aggravates diplomatic tension it can also 
put a heavy burden on the mission doing the sheltering 
chinas leaders on tuesday showed their anger at the us 
decision to grant refuge to fang calling it an interference in 
internal affairs they ordered a nationwide alert for fang telling 
local authorities to arrest him if he is seen trying to escape the 
country 
under international law embassies are the territory of the 
country they represent not territory of the host country 
therefore a dissident or defector who makes it to a foreign embassy 
is usually safe from pursuit if the embassy takes him in 
the embassy has no ability however to guarantee the 
refugeseeker safe passage out of the host country 
in many cases embassies that have supported a dissident feel a 
moral obligation to help him when he gets into trouble 
oftentimes these people will go into an embassy where they 
have friends and its because of these friends and associations 
that theyre being pursued in the first place said peter tarnoff 
the president of the new yorkbased council on foreign relations and 
a former state department official 
tarnoff said in an interview that despite the dislocation that 
the practice sometimes causes for embassies most diplomats believe 
the right to grant refuge is a useful diplomatic privilege 
that includes nations of all ideologies said charles m 
lichenstein a former us ambassador to the united nations and now 
a fellow of the heritage foundation think tank in washington 
the most established totalitarianisms like the soviet union 
to the best of my knowledge respect these principles lichenstein 
said in an interview dictatorships he said tend to claim that 
their own dissidents or defectors who take advantage of embassy 
refuge are in fact common criminals not political activists 
perhaps the longestrunning modern case of embassy asylum was 
that of mindszenty who was arrested by hungarys communist rulers 
in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to life in prison 
hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising but 
mindszenty took refuge in the us mission in budapest after warsaw 
pact forces crushed the revolt he lived there until the vatican 
arranged for his release to the west in 1971 
many embassy refuge cases have involved the east bloc in the 
soviet union seven pentecostalists claiming religious persecution 
lived for five years in a cramped room at the us embassy in 
moscow leaving in 1983 
in the freer atmosphere now prevailing inside the east bloc it 
has even become possible now for citizens of one bloc country to 
seek asylum from another 
latin america has seen many instances of foreign embassies or

the victims rights movement despite achieving 
some recent legislative success has suffered a supreme court 
setback for the second time in two years 
the high court by a 54 vote ruled monday that a jury choosing 
between the death penalty and a life prison term for a convicted 
murderer generally may not be told about the victims personal 
characteristics 
the justices said a south carolina murderer unfairly was 
sentenced to death because a prosecutor told jurors the victim was a 
religious communityminded person 
also monday in another 54 decision the court gave white men 
significant new power to challenge courtapproved affirmative action 
plans even years after they take effect 
the court said white birmingham ala firefighters are entitled 
to a day in court to try to prove an affirmative action program for 
hiring and promoting blacks makes them the victims of unlawful 
reverse racial bias 
in contrast the court on monday killed by a 53 vote a 
sexdiscrimination lawsuit by three women who work at an atampt plant 
in illinois ruling they had waited too long to challenge seniority 
system changes 
writing for the court in the capital sentencing case justice 
william j brennan said the jurys lifeordeath decision cannot be 
based on factors of which the defendant was unaware 
his opinion relied heavily on the courts 1987 decision in which 
victim impact statements were barred from sentencing trials in 
which the death penalty is one possibility 
the maryland legislature had passed a law requiring sentencing 
courts in murder cases to allow members of the victims family to 
testify about the crimes impact on their lives other state 
legislatures had passed similar measures 
the courts four dissenters in the south carolina case said 
monday they are ready to overturn the 1987 decision 
but justice byron r white a dissenter in the 1987 case sided 
with brennan and provided the decisive vote 
justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul 
stevens completed the courts majority 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy dissented 
demetrious gathers was convicted of a 1986 killing in a 
charleston sc city park he killed richard haynes 32 during an 
attack in which haynes was beaten and stabbed 
at gathers sentencing trial a state prosecutor focused on 
haynes characteristics the prosecutor in his closing argument 
told jurors that among the things found at the murder scene were 
various religious items and a voter registration card belonging to 
haynes 
we know from the proof that haynes was a religious person 
he believed in this community he took part the prosecutor 
said 
the south carolina supreme court said those statements deprived 
gathers of a fair sentencing trial and mondays decision upheld 
that ruling 
the content of the various papers the victim happened to be 
carrying when he was attacked was purely fortuitous and cannot 
provide any information relevant to the defendants moral 
culpability brennan wrote

mondays twin earthquakes may have 
startled downtown workers but it didnt surprise oscar the fish 
the eightinchlong swimming seismograph was spotted swimming on 
his side in a classroom aquarium three hours before a quake 
registering 45 on the richter scale hit said ron schnitger a 
biology teacher at corona del mar high school who serves as oscars 
keeper and interpreter 
oscar has done the same before 15 to 20 other quakes schnitger 
said 
he just swims on his side about six inches below the surface 
he said 
the quake was centered under montebello some 25 miles away and 
was hardly strong enough to slosh the water in oscars 140gallon 
tank the quake and a subsequent 43magnitude temblor were 
moderate causing only minor damage and injuring one person 
schnitger said the freshwater fish was a south american red 
oscar the fish is missing one eye but schnitger and other 
believers said his cockeyed swimming doesnt have anything to do 
with trying to see better 
its nothing special for an individual fish to behave 
strangely before an earthquake said john fish who works at the 
aquarium stock co pet store in west los angeles 
so what does oscar think the future holds for quakewary 
californians 
hes upright so we dont have to worry about it any more

a further decline in this years wheat 
prospects is prompting renewed calls for federal drought aid to 
hardhit farming areas that have not yet recovered from the 1988 
burnout 
the agriculture department says farmers are harvesting a winter 
wheat crop estimated at an 11year low of 141 billion bushels down 
10 percent from last years harvest and 2 percent below the may 
forecast 
based on june 1 surveys the latest estimate announced monday 
compares with last months forecast of 143 billion bushels and the 
1988 winter wheat harvest of 156 billion bushels 
the next estimate will be july 12 
officials said the average yield based on june 1 conditions was 
estimated at 345 bushels per acre compared with 349 bushels per 
acre estimated in may and last years per acre average of 392 
bushels 
farmers are expected to have about 408 million acres for harvest 
this year up 3 percent from 398 million acres in 1988 the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its report 
once again we see evidence of a significant shortfall in the 
wheat crop on an expanded area said carl schwensen executive 
vice president of the national association of wheat growers the 
outlook is not likely to improve from this point onward 
winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested the next summer 
makes up about threefourths of total us wheat production the 
remainder is planted in the spring 
next months crop report will include production estimates for 
springplanted wheat thus providing the first 1989 look at total 
us wheat output 
the first estimates of 1989 output of corn soybeans cotton and 
other major crops will be issued aug 10 
lingering drought and lateseason freezes crippled much of the 
winter wheat crop in parts of the great plains notably in kansas 
where this years harvest was estimated at 2024 million bushels 
that was unchanged from may indications but far below last years 
harvest of 323 million bushels 
the continuing effects of drought in kansas and some other states 
have stirred demands for federal aid comparable to the 39 billion 
emergency measure passed by congress last year to help cover 1988 
losses 
legislation has been introduced to expand 1989 drought 
assistance but the administration has opposed any massive 
rapidfire remedies until more is known about the crop situation 
schwensen said the june winter wheat report highlights once 
again the need for federal disaster legislation 
the skimpy wheat outlook is not expected to have a major impact 
on the price of bread or other food products according to usda 
economists 
overall they expect consumer food prices to increase an average 
of 5 percent to 7 percent in 1989 compared with last years average 
gain of 41 percent higher vegetable prices stemming from severe 
winter cold and lingering effects of last years drought are major 
factors 
in a related supplyanddemand report usda projected total 1989 
wheat production a figure based on assumptions of normal weather 
and trend yields at about 203 billion bushels up from last 
years 181 billion bushels that was down slightly from the may 
projection 
the report showed that wheat prices could rise to an average of 
380 per bushel to 420 per bushel in 198990 from 374 per 
bushel in the wheat marketing year that ended may 31 
with higher prices ahead wheat exports could decline to 115 
billion bushels from 144 billion bushels in 198889 the report 
said the us wheat stockpile june 1 1990 would be down to about 
500 million bushels from 616 million bushels on hand this june 1

farmers have contracted with the government to 
take an additional 246 million acres of highly erodible cropland 
from production under the 10year conservation reserve program 
the additional acres were enrolled during the programs eighth 
round of signups held feb 624 the agriculture department said 
monday the next will be july 17 through aug 4 
keith bjerke administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service said the total contracted 
under the crp is nearly 306 million acres 
bjerke said the total now exceeds the 287 million acres that was 
in the 1960 soil bank program making the crp the largest 
longterm cropland retirement program in us history 
under the program farmers agree to take their land from 
production for 10 years in return based on bids they submit 
farmers who are accepted get annual rental payments from the 
government and onetime assistance to pay for half the cost of 
planting trees shrubs and grass to guard against erosion 
average annual rental payments have been running close to 50 per 
acre 
the goal set by congress in the 1985 farm law is to have 40 
million to 45 million acres in the program by 1990

the agriculture department says the outlook 
continues favorable for a bumper grain harvest in the soviet union 
this year

year would include 915 million tons of wheat 1055 million tons 
of coarse grains such as corn and barley and 13 million tons of

the bush administration last month approved the 
sale of nuclear power plant equipment to china that would have 
allowed backers of a canceled us plant to recoup 500 million but 
later rescinded the license after protests from the nuclear 
regulatory commission 
two weeks after issuing an export license for the sale the 
commerce department rescinded it following complaints from the nrc 
and a senate committee chairman who said the deal violated a 1985 
congressional resolution on nuclear nonproliferation officials 
said monday 
the primary beneficiary of the sale would have been holders of 
225 billion in bonds now held in trust by the chemical bank of new 
york according to the officials the bonds were declared in default 
after a washington public power supply system plant near olympia 
wash was canceled in 1982 
we viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law 
said leonard weiss staff director of the senate committee on 
governmental affairs we discovered the state department wasnt 
even aware of this export 
the committees chairman sen john glenn dohio complained in 
a letter to commerce secretary robert a mosbacher that the shipment 
would undercut a 1985 congressional ban on such sales unless the 
president first certified that china is not helping other countries 
build nuclear weapons 
glenn has been a frequent critic of what he says is chinas 
clandestine trade in nuclearrelated materials with third world 
countries particularly pakistan and middle east nations 
weiss said commerce department officials originally contended 
that a nonproliferation declaration from bush was not needed 
because the export license was only for nonreactor components 
however he said mosbacher later informed glenn that the deal was 
being deferred pending consultation with the nrc 
all of the events took place before the chinese governments 
crackdown on student demonstrators in beijing 
the proposed sale stems from cancellation of nuclear power plants 
in 1982 by the washington public power supply system and 88 
participating local utilities in the pacific northwest 
the cancellation of the plant 45 miles west of olympia at 
satsop wash and another at hanford wash touched off the 
biggest bond default in us history and scores of suits by 
bondholders 
last fall a tentative settlement was reached in which wppss and 
the local utilities agreed to pay bondholders roughly 20 cents on 
every dollar they invested in the two plants 
gary petersen a wppss spokesman said the settlement which has 
yet to be approved by a federal judge on phoenix ariz also 
called for the bondholders to receive any proceeds from sale of the 
unfinished plants equipment and other assets 
theres no direct benefit to the supply system other than were 
the custodian for selling the plants assets for the best return of 
the bondholders he said 
harold denton director of governmental and public affairs for 
the nrc said his agency protested the sale because neither the 
white house has not certified to congress that china is a 
fullfledged member of the nonproliferation club 
in addition to the export license for nonnuclear components of 
the satsop plant wppss also has sought permission from the nrc and 
state department to sell its atomic reactor and 250000 pounds of 
enriched uranium fuel to china 
the nrc rejected those license requests earlier this year because 
of the lack of a certification of chinas nonproliferation status 
from the president denton said 
among those lobbying for the export licenses were wppss chemical 
bank as the bondholders trustee the plants designer ebasco 
services of new york and combustion engineering corp the supplier 
of the plants reactor officials said 
while the nrc is in charge of licensing export licenses for 
reactors and nuclear fuel the commerce department has export 
licensing authority for all nonnuclear electric power plant 
components 
however such licenses are not normally approved by either agency 
until after interagency consultations among the nrc the us arms 
control and disarmament agency and the state commerce and energy 
departments 
he said the commerce department license was issued in early may 
without consulting with us but withdrawn two weeks later after 
we found out about it 
it sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part because 
normally they do consult with us denton said in this case 
they didnt theyve corrected that 
since then he said the commerce department has agreed to 
condition any license for the export of nonnuclear components on 
nrc approval of a reactor sale 
both of those events he said are contingent upon certification 
by the state department and the white house that the sales would 
pose no risk of nuclear weapons proliferation

the jury that convicted former congressman 
john jenrette of shoplifting says he should pay a heavy price for 
the necktie and shoes he stole from a suburban washington department 
store 
jenrette was found guilty monday of stealing the items and 
switching price tags on two pieces of clothing the fairfax county 
circuit court jury deliberated only 35 minutes before convicting the 
former lawmaker of the two misdemeanor charges 
the jurors recommended six months in jail and a 1000 fine for 
each of the two violations sentencing was set for aug 18 
the 53yearold former congressman from south carolina served 13 
months in prison and is still on probation for bribery and 
conspiracy convictions in the abscam scandal 
this could trigger three years extra in prison jenrettes 
attorney steve merril said he has his entire life left to lose 
hes going back to the penitentiary and hes losing any chance to 
practice law again 
upon hearing the verdict jenrette stared straight ahead and 
showed little emotion he left the courtroom through a back exit to 
avoid talking to reporters 
its a tremendous setback to his life merril said it 
appeared that he had put his troubles behind him now hes got 
major problems 
jenrette had been found guilty of the charges by a fairfax county 
circuit judge on feb 23 he appealed that verdict in order to bring 
his case before a jury where he felt he could succeed in 
establishing reasonable doubt 
but the jury ended up believing the testimony of two security 
guards at marshalls discount department store in tysons corner 
va heather mckeever and john brown told jurors they viewed 
jenrettes every move through the zoom lens of a security camera 
last dec 7 
ms mckeever said she saw jenrette put on a pair of store shoes 
and place his own in the bottom row of the stores shoe rack 
ms mckeever said jenrette also pocketed a tie and replaced the 
price tags on a pair of pants and a shirt with tags he removed from 
lower priced merchandise 
jenrette paid 14 for items valued at 80 the tie retailed at 
1799 and the shoes were 3999 when he was apprehended the 
former lawmaker had 139 and several credit cards in his pockets 
he said he was sorry and asked if there was anything he could 
do for me personally ms mckeever testified 
merril built his case around the fact that the camera did not 
tape the incident so there was no physical evidence that jenrette 
switched the labels he also questioned the accuracy of the camera 
and asked jurors to note that jenrette left behind a 125 pair of 
shoes 
jenrette testified that the tie was his own he said he brought 
it into the store to compare it with one he was thinking of buying 
and rosemary long jenrettes selfdescribed girlfriend backed him 
up by saying she saw the tie in his car trunk a week before the 
incident 
as for the shoes jenrettes excuse was absentmindedness 
i flat forgot it he said i had them on for 3540 minutes 
and embarrassingly forgot i had them on 
merril told jurors in his closing argument that a conviction 
based upon the evidence provided would be a disgrace 
prosecutor william pickett chose to attack jenrettes defense 
calling it totally fiction 
this defendant for some perverted pleasure went in and stole 
those items pickett said its hard to imagine a more clearcut 
case 
jenrette a democrat who served in congress from 1975 to 1980 
was sentenced to two years in prison and five years probation after 
his conviction in the abscam sting operation in which fbi agents 
posing as arab sheiks and businessmen offered bribes to lawmakers 
it will take an awfully strong person to come back from this 
merril said

as the advertising industry preened to receive 
its annual awards for excellence consumer groups issued mock awards 
of their own for the years most misleading unfair or 
irresponsible ad campaigns 
balancing the industrys coveted clio awards given monday 
night in new york the consumer groups issued their harlan page 
hubbard awards named for a pioneer advertiser of patent medicines 
that were supposed to cure whatever ailed you 
the winners of hubbards should they choose to accept them 
are entitled to a bronzecolored victory figure grasping a lemon 
the results were announced monday by the center for science in the 
public interest 
the us council for energy awareness a previous hubbard 
recipient was singled out for claiming that nuclear power can 
reduce oil imports when in fact most oil is used for gasoline for 
which nuclear power cannot substitute 
carl goldstein spokesman for the group said we dont pay a 
whole lot of attention to things like this he said the 
advertising claims are responsible and verifiable and should be 
judged by what responsible people think about it 
twa was cited for advertising a 298 roundtrip fare to london 
including hotel and car when the actual cost of the trip ranges 
from more than 700 to 1400 according to the cspi 
twa is no longer running the ads and have no further comment 
regarding the award said donald morrison a spokesman for the 
airline 
anheuserbusch was cited for beer commercials featuring a dog 
named spuds mackenzie the cspi said the commercials appeal to 
people under the legal drinking age and associate drinking with 
athletics 
as a responsible corporation we are satisfied that neither the 
spuds mackenzie advertisements nor our other brand commercials 
promote underage consumption said michael j roarty an executive 
vice president of anheuserbusch our commercials are placed only 
in programming in which the majority of viewers are above the legal 
minimum age to consume beer 
rj reynolds tobacco company selected for similar reasons did 
not respond to a request for comment from public relations spokesman 
david fischel 
the cspi also gave hubbards to ohio art co inc of bryan 
ohio for implying that its zaks toy could operate on its own 
power when a child must move the toy and to national benefit life 
insurance for claiming that a life insurance policy with big 
dollar benefits could be purchased for 395 a month when the 
policy provided as little as 1000 worth of coverage 
pat grandy advertising manager for ohio art described the toy 
as being like a puppet the creatures you can build have mouths 
that move ears that wiggle a puppet moves because someone moves 
it 
a call to the life insurance firm which uses bigname older 
actors in its commercials was not returned 
mercedesbenz spotlighted for encouraging reckless highspeed 
driving at 125 mph said it was surprised that such inferences 
were drawn from the advertisement at issue 
theres nothing reckless or irresponsible in the ad said 
ab shuman manager of public relations for the company it shows 
the car is capable of driving in its native country at those speeds 
and the indication is theres a tremendous reserve of handling 
comfort and safety in the united states at our speed limits 
bain de soleil was chosen for the award for promoting 
highpriced products containing a sunscreen rating from 20 to 30 
when the highest meaningful degree of protection most consumers can 
benefit from is a sunscreen rating of 15 
not so said debra bennets the companys director of 
communications we take issue with their assumption many 
dermatologists view a skin protection factor of 15 as a minimum and 
not a maximum level protection thats needed 
she said the skin cancer foundation the american cancer society 
and the national institutes of health have within the last year 
recommended daily use of sunscreens with a rating of 15 or higher 
however a consensus panel organized by nih last month concluded 
that there was no evidence that a protection factor above 15 
provided any additional protection 
the national pork producers council was selected for claiming 
that pork is nutritionally equivalent to chicken even though most 
cuts of pork are higher in saturated fat and cholesterol than 
chicken 
thats not true said charles harness a spokesman for the 
pork producers pork centerloin broiled contains 89 grams fat per 
3ounce serving compare the same thing to a chicken thigh skin on 
and roasted thats 13 grams of fat 
thompson medical company inc makers of dexatrim diet pills was 
chosen for advertising the nonprescription drug would not cause 
nervousness or irritability even though the active ingredient in the 
product is a recognized stimulant 
said kelly kaplan a spokeswoman for the company we sweepingly 
reject the charge and we believe that the charge itself is 
misleading the active ingredient in dexatrim is not a stimulant and 
does not make you nervous when taken in recommended doses

rep william h gray iii is not the target of a 
criminal investigation the justice department said in a statement 
issued less than two days before a house leadership election in 
which the pennsylvania democrat is a candidate 
gray a candidate for majority whip said the departments 
statement monday proved his earlier accounts that he was not 
targeted in a preliminary investigation that government sources have 
said involves allegations of a noshow employee on his staff 
congressman gray is not the target of a criminal investigation 
by the department of justice the department said in the statement 
issued monday night congressman gray and his office have been 
fully cooperating with the department of justice and the fbi 
department spokesman dan eramian said attorney general dick 
thornburgh authorized his executive assistant robert s ross jr 
to make the statement eramian declined to answer questions on why 
the statement was issued monday night 
grays top aide jon plebani said he had been told the 
department issued the statement because officials there believed 
news leaks about the investigation had done gray a serious 
disservice and possibly had influenced the whip contest gray 
currently chairman of the house democratic caucus is one of three 
candidates for the post 
gray in a statement said i have said from the beginning that 
i am not a target and this confirms it i have said from the 
beginning that i and my staff have cooperated fully and this 
confirms it i have done nothing wrong and this too will be 
confirmed 
plebani said an internal review by grays staff had left the 
congressmans staff convinced based on our exhaustive checking 
into every employee who worked for bill gray that weve never had a 
nonperforming employee 
word of the investigation surfaced after gray met with fbi agents 
on memorial day at a washington hotel gray and other congressmen 
including house republican leader robert michel complained to 
thornburgh about the leaks and the attorney general has ordered an 
aide to investigate their source

here are highlights of president bushs 
legislative proposals to clean the nations air 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
requires the 107 dirtiest electric utility plants in 19 states 
to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons and nitrogen 
oxide emissions by 2 million tons by the year 2000 with half of the 
reductions to be achieved by the end of 1995 
costs 700 million annually during the first five years and 
38 billion annually over the second five years the added costs 
are expected to mean higher electric bills but the amount of 
increase will depend on how a utility meets its emissions target 
utilities may meet their emission target by installing new

government after the beijing massacre remained in hiding today to 
study their options after declining to ask for political asylum 
the young consulate officers the first chinese diplomats to 
defect to the united states since the communist revolution in 1949 
met for several hours monday with the immigration and naturalization 
service 
they havent requested anything said david ilchert ins 
regional director they are not in ins custody and told us they do 
not wish to make any statement to the press theyre mulling over 
the options and may wish to seek legal counsel 
meanwhile chinas consul general in san francisco issued a brief 
statement calling the defections utterly unjustifiable and said 
china is making representations to the united states regarding 
the case 
the defectors are worried about giving up their homeland and 
careers but didnt appear to be worried about violent reprisals 
against them said fbi agent richard held 
he said the consulate officers who are at an undisclosed site in 
the san francisco bay area are not in fbi protective custody 
one of their options is to simply remain in the united states for 
another year under the visa extension granted to all chinese 
nationals last week by the bush administration 
zhou limin 26 vice consul for cultural affairs told the 
chinese times in san francisco in an interview published monday that

planned for several days to defect and decided to announce it at a 
candlelight vigil planned outside city hall 
at the vigil which was attended by about 5000 people they told 
the stunned rally they decided to defect after beijing leaders 
launched a propaganda campaign claiming no citizens had died in the 
clash in and around tiananmen square on june 4 
we are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed 
why because we are diplomats but we wont fake it here before we 
are diplomats we are chinese and we are human beings zhang said 
the chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed mostly 
soldiers however chinese witnesses and western intelligence said 
the toll could be as high as 3000 most of them civilians

cambodia should be boosted as high as 30 million to help prevent 
the khmer rouge from returning to power says rep stephen solarz 
dny 
providing military assistance to noncommunist resistance 
forces will strengthen the ability of cambodians wishing to resist 
the khmer rouge after occupying vietnamese forces are withdrawn in 
september solarz told a senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
monday 
these are cambodian forces who are willing to put their lives 
on the line in order to prevent a repetition of the khmer rouge 
holocaust solarz said dont we have a moral obligation to help 
them out 
solarz said he believes the 7 million in military aid sought by 
the bush administration is too little to do the job of strengthening 
anticommunist forces 
i would favor giving them more solarz said this is not a 
light or peripheral issue this is a matter of preventing another 
holocaust for starters i would provide somewhere between 20 
million to 30 million

twin earthquakes that shook los angeles did 
little harm but they scared people and highlighted the danger from 
recently discovered faults concealed deep beneath the nations 
secondlargest city 
the temblors however suggest the danger may be more likely to 
come from a series of moderate quakes than from a muchfeared big 
one 
nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake 
any more than we did before said us geological survey 
seismologist lucile jones what happened today should make you 
feel a little more relieved 
the monday morning quakes injured one person and caused scattered 
minor damage downtown and in suburbs to the east including cracked 
plaster fallen ceiling tiles and broken windows 
scientists said the sharp jolts at 957 am and 1022 am 
measured 45 and 43 on the richter scale respectively they were 
centered on the elysian park fault about 8 miles beneath 
montebello a city about 10 miles southeast of downtown los angeles 
at least five more small aftershocks followed 
the temblors sent highrise construction workers and window 
washers sprinting into downtown los angeles streets and stranded 
some elevator passengers momentarily 
it felt like a bomb struck the building said sheila 
dickinson a downtown worker 
panicky callers overloaded telephone lines making it impossible 
to get dial tones in many areas said michael guerin of the 
california office of emergency services 
based on historical patterns southern california faces a 1 
percent to 2 percent chance of a bigger earthquake within three 
days said jones 
the elysian park fault cuts a 60by10mile swath through the 
heart of the los angeles basin stretching from corona northwest to 
whittier then west to downtown los angeles hollywood beverly 
hills santa monica and malibu 
it was discovered after causing the oct 1 1987 whittier 
narrows quake which with its aftershocks killed eight people 
injured more than 200 and caused 358 million in damage 
that quake also spurred discovery of another fault the 
40by10mile torrancewilmington fault stretching from newport 
beach northwest through long beach los angeles wilmington 
district torrance and santa monica 
scientists dont know if the two faults relieve stress only by 
causing numerous mildtomoderate quakes of magnitude4 to 6 or 
also during infrequent majortogreat quakes of magnitude7 to 8 
said geologist kerry sieh of the california institute of technology 
in pasadena 
a major quake directly under downtown los angeles would be far 
worse than a big one on the more distant san andreas fault 
about 50 miles to the north officials estimate a big san andreas 
quake could kill up to 14000 people seriously injure up to 55000 
and cause 17 billion in damage 
on the richter scale of ground motion every increase of one 
number means a tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 can cause slight damage 4 moderate damage 
5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major 
earthquake capable ofwidespread heavy damage 8 is a great 
quake capable of tremendous damage 
the number of quakes in the basin has been twice normal since 
march 1986 jones said some scientists believe that suggests an 
increased likelihood of a major quake but the fact the recent 
quakes on the elysian park fault have been mild to moderate hints 
that future quakes on the fault may be about the same not larger 
she added 
it takes many smaller quakes to release the same stress as a 
disastrous jolt so i dont think any of us would be surprised if 
we had a flurry of 5s and 6s over the next 30 years sieh said 
on monday one woman was treated for head neck and back pain and 
released from a hospital after a ceiling tile hit her at the 
criminal courts building 
at the county hall of administration many people attending a 
board of supervisors meeting fled outside as ceiling and wall cracks 
sprinkled falling plaster into the auditorium 
the jolt also sent rookie basketball player david rivers running 
for the exit of the forum where the los angeles lakers were 
watching film of sundays game of the national basketball 
associations championship series 
i thought kevin johnson of phoenix was the quickest guard in 
the league but not after i saw david run for the door the 
lakers mychal thompson said

admitting years of steroid use in his quest to 
become the worlds fastest man ben johnson said he knew the drugs 
were banned but never would have taken them had he known of their 
potentially harmful side effects 
nobody bothered to tell me what the side effects were because 
they were happy to be making all this money the jamaicanborn 
sprinter told a canadian inquiry into drugs and athletics on monday 
nearly nine months ago johnson tested positive for the 
musclebuilding anabolic steroid stanozolol and was stripped in 
seoul of the 100meter olympic gold medal he won representing his 
adopted country 
johnson whose only previous statement since the disgrace had 
been that he never knowingly used illegal drugs still must tell the 
inquiry what happened in the weeks leading up to sept 24 when he 
tested positive 
on monday under oath johnson started what could be several days 
of testimony by admitting steriod use for the first time 
every shot that i got with an injection from his coach and 
teammates i had in my own mind that it was banned he said 
johnson said that his first use of steroids was in pill form in 
1981 and 1982 the steroids dianabol and stanozolol taken under 
direction of charlie francis his coach since 1977 
charlies my coach and if he gave me something to take id 
take it he said 
but by the time of the 1983 pan american games in caracas 
venezuela johnson said he was aware that he was getting steroids 
that they they were banned and that he risked disqualification if 
they were found in his system 
johnson said he left to others the concern about clearance times 
or how long before competition he had to stop taking the drugs so 
his system would be free of them 
im not the coach i just take orders he said 
he differed only from francis and personal physician dr jamie 
astaphan on the issue of whether they informed him about steroids 
potential for damaging health 
if they told me what the side effects were at that time i 
wouldnt have been part of the group at all the 27yearold 
johnson said 
the sprinter said it was francis idea that he use steroids 
i didnt go up to him and say i wanted to take it he said the 
whole world was using them and the only way id get better was if i 
took these drugs johnson said 
francis delivered eight days of often sensational testimony to 
the inquiry in february and march saying he believes athletes need 
to take them in order to be competitive because their use is 
pervasive among worldclass athletes 
astaphan confirmed in his appearance that he provided steroids 
for johnson since 1984 the doctor boasted of his ability to beat 
steroid tests and could not explain why stanozolol was found in 
johnsons system at seoul 
johnsons mother two sisters and brother were in the hearing 
room as the athlete calmly answered questions often responding only 
yes or no his father was home in jamaica 
the athlete forfeited his 979second performance at seoul 
because of the positive test but still holds the world record of 
983 seconds set at rome in 1987 he has said he hopes to compete 
again after the end of the twoyear ban that the international 
amateur athletic federation which governs world track and field 
imposed for the positive test 
estimates of the amount of endorsements and other income that 
johnson lost as a result of the olympic scandal run as high as 20 
million

officials welcomed a federal agencys 
decision allowing the city to resume digging a ditch around its 
reservoir to divert a stream allegedly contaminated at the rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant 
im elated city manager george diciero said after learning 
of the decision by the environmental protection agency 
diciero said work on the ditch would resume today 
meanwhile gov roy romer said he won assurance in washington 
dc from james d watkins head of the department of energy that 
the federal government would give the state what it needs to conduct 
its own environmental testing at rocky flats 
the purpose of the meeting was to deliver a message that they 
either have to clean it up or close it romer said of the plant 
which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons the response i got 
from adm watkins and his officials was absolute cooperation 
romer said he also wants state workers to monitor the handling of 
the hazardous waste at rocky flats rather than relying on the doe 
i intend to put in place the kind of monitoring where we dont 
need to rely on anybody else were going to have independent 
verification romer said 
last tuesday 75 fbi agents and epa investigators raided the 
plant as part of a us justice department investigation into 
allegations of fraudulent disposal and burning of hazardous 
materials at the site 
an affidavit made public last week charged that hazardous 
chemicals were dumped illegally into creeks at rocky flats last 
november the affidavit said the doe which owns the plant and 
rockwell international corp which operates it tried to conceal 
the illegal disposal of wastes 
following the allegations broomfield last week began digging a 
diversion ditch and building an earthen dam to divert walnut creek 
walnut creek flows out of rocky flats into great western 
reservoir which supplies half of broomfields drinking water the 
creek provides about 5 percent of the water needs of this denver 
suburb of 27600 residents 
the epa had halted the work over the weekend saying the city 
needed federal permits but epa officials on monday gave a goahead 
after meeting with city and federal officials and visiting the site 
the flow in the river is an absolute trickle said max 
dodson director of water management for the epas denver office 
the size of the stream and of the impacted area is not that 
significant 
dodson said a letter of confirmation that the work could proceed 
would be sent to the city by the army corps of engineers 
we want to do the diversion so we can have peace of mind and 
tell our residents the water is safe said george diciero 
broomfield city manager 
the state health department said samples taken over the weekend 
of drinking water in broomfield and other communities were not 
contaminated by any of 59 organic substances typically analyzed in 
checking drinking water 
however the state still was testing for 13 other chemicals cited 
by federal investigators in their probe of rocky flats results were 
expected later in the week department assistant director tom looby 
said 
we are confident that these initial tests indicate that the 
likelihood of any of the 13 chemicals being found in these drinking 
water supplies is very very small looby said

officials will be watching this summmer to 
see if new vapor control nozzles at gasoline stations noticeably 
improve air quality in new jersey the second state to require the 
devices 
new jersey officials imposed the regulations jan 1 on the 
states larger stations hoping to decrease harmful ozone pollution 
by between 3 percent and 5 percent to meet standards set by the 
federal clean air act the states smaller stations must comply by 
next year 
legislation to enact gasoline vapor control programs is pending 
in statehouses in massachusetts tennessee vermont pennsylvania 
and oregon said s william becker executive director of the 
association of state and territorial air pollution program 
administrators in washington 
but he said he would prefer national legislation to make the laws 
uniform 
we would prefer that congress mandate it what we have learned 
in the clean air act debate is that no progress is made and in fact 
things just get worse unless we adopt innovative technology he 
said 
the nozzles which look like small black accordions are designed 
to capture vapors normally emitted by gasoline when it is pumped 
into an automobile a vaporlock system routes the vapors back into 
the stations underground holding tanks where it reverts to liquid 
form 
new jersey follows california in enacting vapor control 
regulations california has had the nozzles since jan 1 1988 
also new york city the district of columbia st louis and several 
florida cities have similar laws john elston assistant director of 
air quality management at the new jersey department of environmental 
protection called the new nozzles a start in cleaning the air 
this regulation moves us one step closer to the real problem 
the motoring public he said 
many service station owners have opposed the new nozzles 
were not trying to stand in the way of progress but weve 
made a big capital outlay to comply with this for a very small 
improvement in air quality said john holtz associate director of 
the new jersey petroleum council the council estimated the nozzles 
cost an average of 29000 per station 
rolando idal a gas station attendant at a busy gulf station on 
us highway 1amp9 in elizabeth doesnt like the new system for 
another reason 
laboring between a truck belching exhaust fumes and a car whose 
gas tank resisted the bulky nozzle he said maybe it helps the 
air but they make it very hard to work they click off at the wrong 
time they scratch up the cars and the people think its my fault

after a fruitless search last year the german 
battleship bismarck has been found on the ocean floor 600 miles off 
the coast of france 48 years after it was sunk by the british navy 
the bismarck was located monday under 15000 feet of water by a 
remotecontrolled robot named argo that scuttles across the ocean 
floor argo and his master expedition leader dr robert ballard 
also discovered the sunken titanic four years ago 
the bismarck was sitting upright on the sea floor intact in an 
excellent state of preservation about 600 miles west of brest on 
the brittany coast said ballard who is based at woods hole 
oceanographic institution on cape cod 
the discovery is likely to trigger great curiosity among naval 
historians said maj charles neimeyer a history professor at the 
us naval academy 
theyll be looking for the sort of technology the germans had 
at the time because this ship was considered stateoftheart he 
said the find could answer questions about the way the ship went 
down and how the crew lived and survived at sea on a german 
warship he added 
no human remains were found near the bismarck on which all but 
about 100 of the 2200 crew members perished a memorial service for 
those who perished was held aboard one of the expeditions ships 
the ship will be left undisturbed as a grave site like the 
titanic according to david gallo assistant director of the center 
for marine exploration at woods hole the battleship might be 
explored by the sophisticated robot though gallo said 
ballard and a research team searched several days for the 
bismarck last year instead of the bismarck the explorers found a 
19th century sailing ship that has yet to be identified gallo said 
there were quite a few reports about its position when it 
sank gallo said but the problem is those reports can be off 
by a mile or more and a mile at sea when youre looking at the sea 
floor represents a very large area to be covered in a search 
the demise of the dreaded bismarck which was equipped with eight 
15inch guns began on may 24 1941 when it encountered the royal 
navy off the coast of greenland 
the bismarck sank britains battle cruiser hood but was hit by 
the prince of wales the germans then fled south for occupied france 
with the british in pursuit 
two days later british warships and aircraft located the 
crippled vessel and launched a furious attack the bismarck finally 
went down the next day 
the successful campaign was a significant victory for the allies 
who thwarted hitlers plan to use the bismarck to raid atlantic 
ocean shipping lanes 
neimeyer said the victory also gave a big psychological boost to 
the royal navy which was stunned by the loss of the hood 
tis gave confidence to the carrieraviation community that they 
could indeed sink a battleship he said 
the expedition was jointly funded by turner broadcasting system 
inc and a group of private investors the national geographic 
society plans to produce a documentary on the discovery that will be 
televised next fall

the dollar continued its rise against the japanese 
yen tuesday causing a further decline in stock prices dealers said 
the dollar gained 030 yen closing at 14870 yen its highest 
level since aug 17 1987 when it closed at 15020 yen on monday 
the us currency shot up 490 yen to 14840 yen 
after opening tuesday at 14880 yen the dollar ranged between 
14845 and 14975 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
fell 18446 points or 055 percent closing at 3321355 the index 
dropped 24197 points on monday 
a dealer at the bank of tokyo speaking on condition of 
anonymity said continued dollarbuying was linked to a flight to 
quality by investors 
it is not that japan itself is unstable but to investors the 
dollar is still safer he said 
he said the violent suppression of demonstrators in china a 
major trading partner of japan was one reason for investors flight 
from the yen 
nevertheless he said even if the dollar exceeds 150 yen there 
wont be a large impact on japan 
there is very little possibility that prices will rise he 
said 
the dealer also said the bank of japan intervened several times 
during the day in support of the yen selling 1 billion in the us 
currency 
the intervention helped to stop dollarbuying when the currency 
neared the 150yen level he said adding that dealers also began 
profittaking 
the falling yen has discouraged stock purchases on the tokyo 
exchange said an analyst at new japan securities also speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
no stock received particular attention during the days trading 
in which only 500 million shares were traded he said

our headlights he said 
the apna convention is being held in conjunction with displays of 
futuristic technology and its theme is protocols for progress 
every year we have a little clutch of fear that our technology

their coffee anymore he said they might like to but they have

syrian and christian forces fought with 
tanks and recoilless rifles in hills southeast of beirut today 
dampening hopes that arab league efforts would swiftly end the 
latest outbreak in the 14year civil war 
a spokesman for christian army commander michel aoun said syrian 
gunners were shelling his forces positions in hills around the 
mountain town of souk elgharb as well as in beiruts christian 
suburbs of kfarshima and hadath 
he said the syrians were shelling from positions in the village 
of aitat opposite souk elgharb and from the suburb of choueifat 
the spokesman accused the syrians of starting the barrage as arab 
league assistant secretary general lakhdar ibrahimi crossed beiruts 
dividing green line for talks with gen aoun and other christian 
leaders in east beirut 
they shelled us with tank cannons and recoilless rifles we are 
responding in kind said the spokesman on condition of anonymity 
he accused the syrians of provoking the fighting to foil 
efforts by arab leaders to work out a solid ceasefire 
shortly before dawn syrian howitzer batteries deployed in moslem 
west beirut fired 20 shells at the coastline north of the city in an 
apparent effort to maintain a blockade of christian ports 
police said the 130mm shells exploded around the ports of byblos 
and jounieh no casualties were reported 
the renewed shelling after a twoday lull contrasted sharply with 
reports in lebanese media that a ceasefire agreement had been 
worked out by ibrahimi in damascus the syrian capital 
the prosyrian daily paper assafir reported in its main story 
today that an air of optimism prevails over the situation in light 
of ibrahimis talks 
ibrahimi arrived in west beirut from damascus on monday he held 
talks in the citys moslem sector with salim hoss aouns rival as 
head of the moslem cabinet in lebanons dual government 
in damascus ibrahimi met over the weekend with president hafez 
assad and his foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
syria has 40000 troops in predominantly moslem sectors of 
lebanon extending from the northern akkar plain across the eastern 
bekaa valley to west and south beirut 
the official syrian news agency sana quoted alsharaa as saying 
the damascus talks centered on the need for the warring lebanese 
factions to reach agreement on the mechanism for lifting blockades 
reopening crossing points and making the ceasefire comprehensive 
the current round of violence broke out march 8 two days after 
aoun blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of 
beirut in order to salvage lost customs dues of around 100 million 
annually 
the syrians and their moslem militia allies retaliated by 
blockading the 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of the 
capital that is home to 1 million christians 
at least 367 people have been killed and 1432 wounded in the 
confrontation by police count 
aoun has agreed to previous arab calls that he should lift the 
blockade the syrians however have refused to call off their siege 
of the christian enclave to prevent aoun from obtaining 
iraqishipped war materiel

federal investigators probing embezzlement in 
the us department of housing and urban development want to 
question a lawyer about the disappearance of 3 million in the 
washington area a newspaper reported 
earl martin who has been missing for about a year is wanted for 
questioning in the probe of huds washington field office which 
administers federal housing programs in the district of columbia and 
its maryland and virginia suburbs the sun in baltimore reported 
today 
martin was a closing agent who represented hud at settlement when 
it sold houses in the district of columbia he worked for the 
washington office at the same time as maryland real estate agent 
marilyn louis harrell who allegedly embezzled 55 million as a 
closing agent for the department in the maryland suburbs 
ms harrell who has not been charged has admitted taking the 
funds and claimed she gave the money to charities because of that 
investigators have nicknamed her robin hud 
the sun reported that neither martin nor harrell were bonded as a 
precaution against theft or loss 
its another example of incredible carelessness the 
newspaper quoted a senior hud official as saying the washington 
office was in a state of total disarray 
meanwhile the washington post reported today that hud this week 
will begin a systematic review of property sales demanding that 53 
field offices explain what happened to any unaccountedfor proceeds 
according to a memo from secretary jack kemp 
the post said the content of the memo was disclosed by a senior 
hud official who estimated that as much as 100 million may be 
unaccounted for the source based the estimate on the early findings 
of audits of 11 field offices the newspaper reported 
the washington probe is one of several being conducted throughout 
the country in dallas a closing agent has been indicted in 
connection with the theft of 25 million in hud funds probes also 
are underway in denver los angeles and new orleans 
hud officials were able to provide little information about 
martin the sun reported motor vehicle records showed martin lived 
in potomac md neighbors said martin ran into financial trouble and 
sold his house last year the newspaper reported 
ms harrell said monday she was glad the embezzlement was finally 
discovered 
it really got out of hand she said in an interview at her 
camp spring md home im not at all proud of it im really 
glad its out in the open to carry this inside is so difficult why 
try to say i didnt do it i did it and im not proud of it at all 
ms harrell said she used the hud money in the past four years to 
fund a variety of charities in baltimore and suburban washington 
that serve the homeless drug addicts suicidal teens and the 
elderly 
i was just drawn into it she said hud doesnt serve the 
poor theres no way they serve the poor they dispossess the poor 
and i think thats unconscionable

kraft is apologizing but consumers say its 
pretty cheesy that the food maker called off a promotional contest 
in which thousands of consumers stood to win a new van 
the ready to roll contest required consumers to match the 
right half of game pieces carried in advertisements in sunday 
newspapers with leftsided pieces inserted in packages of specially 
marked kraft singles cheese slices the ads ran in the chicago and 
houston areas 
kraft planned to give away one dodge caravan valued at 17000 
100 bicycles 500 skateboards and 8000 packages of kraft singles 
according to the company the odds of winning the van were 1 in 
152 million 
but because of an error by the printer of the game pieces inside 
the cheese packages it is likely that thousands and thousands 
would have won the van said kathy knuth spokeswoman for the 
foodmaker based in suburban glenview 
instead of only a limited number of winning game pieces a 
company statement read essentially all of the game pieces appear 
to be winning ones 
kraft declared the contest null and void and pulled packages of 
singles from stores in chicago and houston 
the company regrets any confusion this promotion may have 
caused knuth said 
some consumers who won the dodge think theyre getting a 
dodge from kraft 
im not letting them get away with this baloney said sharon 
lamont of suburban skokie who claims to be a van winner along with 
her sister and mother 
i won a dodge caravan and four skateboards said karen 
winslow of des plaines now when i send it in ill probably get 
a packet of coupons for kraft cheese or something like that

in a setback for the prosecution a 
witness today changed his story in court and supported the alibi of 
a friend the man accused of killing prime minister olof palme 
the testimony came during the second week of the trial of carl 
gustaf christer pettersson who is accused of shooting palme to 
death in 1986 as the fourterm swedish leader was walking home with 
his wife from a movie 
witness ulf stinnars 35 claimed police interrogators had hinted 
that he could be eligible for the 50 million kronor 8 million 
reward if his testimony about petterssons whereabouts after the 
shooting was helpful 
the police tried to coax me with money they said 50 million 
50 million stinnars told the court 
stinnars led into the courtroom between two policemen wore a 
tattered jeans jacket and jogging pants and refused to remove his 
baseball cap and sunglasses apparently to keep his face hidden from 
courtroom artists 
he also refused to speak until the court agreed that his 
testimony would not be broadcast on national radio previous 
sessions have been broadcast 
after a 15minute recess chief magistrate michael af geijerstam 
ordered the radio not to transmit from the courtroom 
stinnars was called by the prosecution to repeat his story that 
pettersson returned to his suburban apartment about 1230 or 1 am 
on the night of the shooting countering petterssons alibi 
but stinners withdrew that story in court saying he now believed 
the defendant had been home before midnight on feb 28 1986 if 
true it would mean pettersson could not have shot palme in downtown 
stockholm at 1123 pm 
i cant remember ive thought about this for three months and 
i dont want to lie here so i cant say im sure stinnars said 
he acknowledged that he had spoken with pettersson about the hour 
pettersson returned but denied his friend had intimidated him to 
change his story 
stinnars also said he was taking drugs when he was first 
questioned by police and his memory was impaired 
he said he waited at the apartment while pettersson went into 
town to get a supply of drugs they often got drunk and used drugs 
together he testified 
pettersson 42 who has a police record of more than 60 crimes 
including a manslaughter conviction has pleaded innocent 
on wednesday the prosecution is expected to call its key 
witness lisbet palme who is expected to identify pettersson as the 
man she saw fleeing after her husband was shot 
in an adjoining room of the district court the former stockholm 
police commissioner who led the initial murder investigation was 
acquitted today of charges of disclosing secret information about 
the investigation 
the court found that hans holmer had not violated secrecy or 
libel laws in his 1988 book palme is shot in which he described 
the surveillance of suspects and disclosed the identity of witnesses 
holmer was fired in february 1987

the mayor says a us supreme court 
decision enabling white firefighters to challenge the citys 
racially tailored hiring plan is a setback for civil rights 
certainly its part of what i think is a carefully designed 
plan to turn the clock back on affirmative action period 
everywhere mayor richard arrington the citys first black mayor 
said after the ruling monday 
were very very disappointed its going to be a long hot 
summer 
ray fitzpatrick a lawyer for the citys firefighters union said 
the decision is a step toward ending racebased policies that hurt 
white workers 
in its 54 decision the high court held that the affirmative 
action plan approved by the city and a lower court is open to 
challenge by workers who took no part in the case that led to the 
agreement 
the case is expected to go to trial in federal court but no date 
has been set 
fire chief neal gallant declined to comment on the decision 
a civil rights attorney said birminghams history makes it ideal 
for testing affirmative action 
in the 1960s segregated birmingham was the site of civil rights 
protests in which police used firehoses and dogs against 
demonstrators many of them children news coverage of the protests 
galvanized the civil rights movement 
you would have to ignore several hundred years of united states 
history to find there wasnt sufficient record to warrant 
affirmative action here said robert joffe of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
joffe in a telephone interview from new york said the decision 
is just another unfortunately in a too long line of recent cases 
in which the supreme court has put up roadblocks in the way of 
affirmative action 
the case began in 1974 when the naacp and blacks filed a lawsuit 
charging racial bias in the fire department both sides eventually 
agreed on a plan for hiring and promoting minorities 
seven white firefighters challenged the plan saying 
lessqualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them 
a federal judge ruled the white firefighters must abide by the 
consent decree but a federal appeals court in 1987 reinstated the 
lawsuit and the supreme court agreed 
lt charles brush president of the union local said many whites 
have left the department after being passed over for promotions by 
blacks with less seniority 
birminghams population of 276000 is about 55 percent black and 
45 percent white of 497 firefighters 379 or 76 percent are white 
and 118 or 24 percent are black of 151 officers 38 or 25 
percent are black

former president reagan urged the west today to 
take risks with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev saying he was 
the soviets best and probably only hope to turn things around 
reagan also declared that the chinese government hasnt learned 
something very elementary you cant massacre an idea you cannot 
run tanks over hope you cannot riddle a peoples yearning with 
bullets 
in a speech on his first visit to london since stepping down as 
president reagan painted a sweeping picture of a world gripped by 
an information revolution in which computers and satellite dishes 
would inevitably dissolve the barriers between east and west and 
democracy would supplant communism 
i believe mikhail gorbachev is the soviets best and probably

the west i support president bushs proposal to keep pressure on 
the soviets to make good on their calls to reduce arms

friends of a judge who was shot to 
death in her chambers by her estranged husband took comfort when he 
was sentenced to two life terms 
the trial of 53yearold former policeman clarence ratliff caused 
outrage last month when he was convicted of manslaughter instead of 
murder for killing district judge carol s irons on oct 19 
i think our message was heard said sara smolenski a friend 
of irons who organized a petition drive and letter campaign calling 
for the maximum sentence 
ratliff on monday was given the maximum 10 to 15 years for 
voluntary manslaughter and two life terms the maximum for 
assault with intent to murder for shooting at officers who tried to 
help the mortally wounded irons neither officer was hit 
the sentences will run concurrently ratliff will be eligible for 
parole in 10 years a murder conviction could have resulted in life 
without parole 
irons friends and relatives hugged outside the courtroom after 
the sentencing 
circuit judge dennis kolenda said community sentiment played a 
part in his decision to exceed sentencing guidelines calling for 
seven to 15 years for assault with intent to murder he also said 
the site of the crime and ratliffs position compounded the 
seriousness of the slaying 
by resolving your dispute in the most violent way known to 
human nature by doing it in the place where peaceful resolution is 
always supposed to happen you struck close to a mortal blow to the 
peace of this community kolenda told ratliff 
ratliff had contended he didnt plan to kill irons but was drunk 
and angry about a property dispute in their divorce proceedings 
before the sentencing friends family and coworkers of irons 
40 addressed the court criticizing the law that allowed ratliff 
and defense witnesses to discuss irons alleged extramarital affairs 
as the trial went on and carols character was assassinated 
daily i waited and waited for some sign of remorse on the part 
of the defendant said nora lee carrier potts 
potts said she hoped the sentence would eliminate societys 
acceptance of the little boy excuse of i couldnt help it she 
made me mad

southern baptists put off a proposal to set up a 
conservative lobbying group in washington clearing the decks for 
the election today of a president of the nations largest protestant 
denomination 
the denominations executive committee voted unanimously monday 
to wait until next years convention to recommend creation of a 
religious liberty commission to lobby on issues such as school 
prayer and tuition tax credits 
that left the election between 44yearold daniel vestal pastor 
of dunwoody baptist church in suburban atlanta and incumbent jerry 
vines 51 pastor of first baptist church of jacksonville fla as 
the only major issue of the convention 
vines asked the executive committee to postpone the proposal for 
a religious liberty commission in the interests of a peaceful 
convention meeting and a positive witness in las vegas 
but the battle lines continued to be drawn as moderates hoped to 
reverse a decadelong string of conservative victories in 
presidential elections 
i think the southern baptist convention is in serious 
condition serious trouble said daniel vestal the moderate 
candidate for the presidency a lot of people are at the point of 
dropping out 
the 148 millionmember denomination has more than doubled its 
membership in the past quartercentury but has grown by barely more 
than half a percent in each of the last two years 
the convention presidency is considered a critical post because 
the officer appoints the committee on committees which has a 
central role in selecting people for the conventions boards 
commissions and committees 
vines is scheduled to address the convention prior to the 
election today while vestal appealed to delegates sunday and monday 
evenings in halfhour programs on a local television station paid 
for by his supporters 
also monday pbs reporter bill moyers withdrew a request to 
appear before the executive committee to discuss its criticism of 
his god and politics documentary the committee in february said 
the documentary was biased in support of southern baptist moderates 
moyers said in a letter to the committee that he realized i am 
up against a situation most unbaptist closed minds and in the 
parlance of your host city a stacked deck 
in other preconvention business a conservative pastor tom 
elliff pastor of first southern baptist church in suburban oklahoma 
city was elected president of the 6000member sbc pastors 
conference 
the central issues in the debate between the southern baptist 
moderates and conservatives cross over theological and political 
boundaries 
conservatives accuse moderates of being open to biblical 
interpretations that challenge the foundations of southern baptist 
faith 
but the moderates charge conservatives with violating another 
central belief of southern baptists that individuals are able to 
interpret the bible for themselves 
the issues have engendered passionate debate but paul pressler 
a houston judge who has helped rally conservatives to 10 straight 
presidential victories since 1979 said even if the moderates win 
the presidential election the war is over 
the course correction has been made he said

slip the mind of vice president dan quayle 
george bushs birthday is something i could not forget 
quayle said monday as he sat in the luxurious hilltop residence of 
us ambassador everett e briggs 
quayle had a good reason for remembering the occasion despite a 
day filled with plane helicopter and motorcade trips across two 
countries and a myriad of meetings that focused on the region 
because it also happens to be my mothers birthday quayle 
said 
he said he cabled birthday greetings to washington for the

through guatemala city

small openair store and went on a short shopping spree as a crowd 
of onlookers gathered 
the saleswoman showed him tshirts and a peasant skirt but 
quayle had his eye on the stores assortment of soccer balls 
quayle bought one saying his children tucker benjamin and 
corinne were very good at the sport but he tried it out first on 
the crowd out on the sidewalk tossing it to one lad who deftly 
returned it each time with his head 
quayle then threw the ball into a crowd of adults who scrambled 
all over it ill never see that quayle laughed in an aside 
apparently thinking he would not get the ball back but sure enough 
it popped into the air tossed right to him as he entered his limo

educators here have drawn the line against 
naming a school for the alamo hero william barret travis the 
problem skeletons in his closet 
it turns out the man who drew the famous line in the dirt during 
the defense of the chapelfort in 1836 abandoned his wife and child 
and owned slaves 
bryan school trustees voted monday night to name the school 
instead after black educator mary branch the first woman college 
president in texas 
countless schools and streets in texas are named for travis in 
fact the school named for branch will replace bryans travis 
elementary school which will close next year bryan is a town of 
59000 about 60 miles from houston 
during the siege of the alamo travis wrote an appeal for help 
legend also has it that when the defenders were surrounded by 
mexican troops he drew a line and asked those willing to die for 
freedom to cross it with him 
trustee wendy costa pointed out that travis had abandoned his 
family noting also that bryans population is 22 percent black she 
asked how can we even consider naming a school after someone who 
was so strongly in favor of slavery 
bob calvert of the texas state historical society described 
travis as a neerdowell who in two weeks time happened to do 
something wonderful 
all of my life ive been told that william barret travis is the 
greatest texas hero said trustee travis bryan jr no power on 
earth can convince me hes not not even wendy costa 
the name of william barret travis must be sustained im going 
to vote for him even if everybody votes against me bryan said 
the vote was 43 in favor of ms branch

civil rights advocates seeking to prevent 
affirmative action programs from being rolled back are shifting 
their sights to congress following a series of major setbacks in the 
supreme court 
it is just not possible for civil rights advocates to do 
business in federal courts any more russell galloway a professor 
at the santa clara university school of law in california said 
monday 
galloway and others commented after the high court ruled 54 that 
white firefighters in birmingham ala are entitled to bring suit 
to attack an affirmative action plan approved eight years ago to 
settle a lawsuit the white firefighters were not a party to the 
lawsuit and say they should not be governed by a settlement in which 
they had no say 
the decision was the latest in a series of high court decisions 
chipping away at affirmative action programs which have been used 
to give hiring and promotion preference to minorities and women 
civil rights groups contend the programs are necessary to 
compensate for years of past discrimination but the high courts 
conservative majority is showing a new concern over the issue of 
reverse discrimination 
the court ruled in january that state and local governments may 
generally not impose racial quotas for hiring on public works 
projects and on june 5 the justices made it more difficult for 
minorities to prove statistically that they are being relegated to 
less desirable jobs 
ray fitzpatrick an attorney representing the white firemen in 
birmingham said mondays ruling is a step toward ending 
racebased quota promotions that unfairly discriminate against 
whites 
in our view the oneforone black and white promotions that 
birmingham has been following for eight years are not legal under 
the us constitution fitzpatrick said today on cbs this 
morning theyre excessive the black population at the 
firefighter entry level is about 10 to 13 percent yet 50 percent of 
the promotions are going to blacks 
civil rights and womens groups however say they may ask 
congress to reverse the high court rulings 
i think a legislative remedy is something that is probably 
going to be pursued said judith winston a lawyer for the womens 
legal defense fund 
the time may have come to again go to the congress and attempt 
to get the congress to overrule what the court has done in the civil 
rights area said patrick patterson of the naacp legal defense 
fund in los angeles 
i think it is indispensable at this point that the battle be 
taken to congress said galloway who specializes in affirmative 
action law 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil rights said he was saddened by the courts 
decision and added well have to take a look at it with an eye 
to possible legislation 
this decision will open old wounds and create unfortunate new 
levels of racial animosity edwards said 
already he said his staff has been meeting with civil rights 
groups and professors about the june 5 decision he said legislation 
would be introduced and hearings probably held soon 
the last major congressional debate on civil rights was touched 
off by a high court decision in 1984 that placed limits on laws 
barring federal aid to schools and other institutions that 
discriminate legislation restoring the original broader 
interpretation of the laws was passed over former president reagans 
veto last year after a long struggle 
president bush so far has been noncommittal on the issue of 
affirmative action which was strongly opposed by reagan after the 
courts june 5 decision on statistical evidence bush said in 
response to a question that the ruling was still being studied but 
sometimes you can take remedy in suggested legislation 
some observers said they think bush might be more amenable than 
reagan was to legislative action in the civil rights field 
i think the bush administration is more concerned about 
reaching out to the black community than the past administration 
was said t alexander aleinikoff a professor at the university 
of michigan law school who follows civil rights cases closely 
said santa clara universitys galloway they havent taken a 
clear stance on affirmative action yet but i hope they may be 
somewhat more moderate

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and chancellor helmut kohl signed a broad declaration today that 
calls for a 50 percent reduction in nuclear arsenals and a worldwide 
ban on chemical weapons 
the document on common principles of both nations was signed on 
the second day of the soviet leaders first state visit to west 
germany 
the pact signed by kohl and gorbachev said their countries have a 
common european heritage and that european nations should exist in 
peaceful competition with one another and reduce their military 
might 
it also said cooperation by west germany and the soviet union 
is not directed against anyone and that a special place in the 
common european home is reserved for the united states and 
canada 
asked if the agreement could help resolve territorial questions 
stirred by the 1939 nonaggression pact signed by adolf hitler and 
josef stalin which allowed the soviet union to annex three 
independent baltic states gorbachev told the associated press i 
dont think we need to turn to such a distant chapter of history 
he said the joint agreement was to formalize the wish of both 
moscow and bonn to enter a new stage in our relations 
the signing ceremony was carried live on west german television 
the two nations appealed for a 50 percent reduction in the 
strategic nuclear arsenal of the superpowers and a reduction in 
conventional armies and weapons in all of europe 
the document called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons a 
treaty banning nuclear tests and the preservation of the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
that accord signed by both superpowers is seen by the soviets 
and west germans as a document banning the development of star 
wars space defenses advocated by president bushs predecessor 
ronald reagan 
the document signed today also stressed the importance of respect 
for human rights cultural contacts and youth exchanges for 
promoting lasting peace 
the soviets and west germans also signed 11 other agreements 
including pacts to establish a hot line between bonn and the 
kremlin and to increase educational and youth exchanges 
earlier gorbachev received a rapturous reception that 
outstripped the welcome given two weeks ago to bush who scores far 
below the soviet leader in west german opinion polls 
when gorbachev arrived in this key nato country on monday he 
declared that moscow and bonn had begun a new chapter in 
relations that could bring a new era of peace to the continent he 
also welcomed us proposals to reduce conventional forces on the 
continent saying they offer chances for speedy agreement 
outside bonns 18thcentury town hall today a crowd chanted 
gorby gorby and waved dozens of soviet flags 
a soviet leader surrounded by cheering west germans who would 
have thought of that a few years ago exclaimed a television 
commentator during a live national broadcast 
other banners reflected the german pain at the postwar division 
of their nation and of the former capital berlin telling gorbachev 
german unity peace in europe and in english gorby make 
love not walls 
no german needs to be reminded of the berlin wall 
most of the crowd cheered gorbachev but many hooted disapproval 
when mayor hans daniels in a brief speech before a ceremonial 
exchange of gifts referred to bonn as only the temporary capital of 
germany substituting for berlin 
gorbachev proposed monday that west germany and the soviet union 
combat pollution and exchange technology and emergency assistance in 
case of an environmental disaster 
and in a gesture of reconciliation the soviet union released the 
names of 1500 german soldiers who died in its prisonerofwar camps 
during world war ii it was the first time the soviets had provided 
a list of german soldiers still unaccounted for after the war west 
german officials said 
at a formal dinner monday night gorbachev said the soviets were 
pleased that the west has responded to some warsaw pact suggestions 
in bushs arms control proposal last month which links shortrange 
nuclear missile reductions to swift and substantial cuts in 
conventional forces 
there is now reason to presume that an agreement in vienna 
conventional arms talks can be reached much more quickly than was 
expected earlier he said 
gorbachev stressed however that the kremlin still wants 
separate talks on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
bush has pushed for progress on conventional arms before shortrange 
missiles are addressed 
kohl appealed to gorbachev for the kremlin to make a unilateral 
cut in shortrange nuclear missiles the soviets concede that the 
warsaw pact has an advantage in shortrange forces in europe 
gorbachev said the warsaw pact would wait until a meeting of its 
leaders expected next month to give a detailed response to bushs 
proposals for substantial cuts in eastbloc and western armies in 
europe by the early 1990s

the federal equal employment opportunity 
commission has sued on behalf of a state supreme court justice who 
is challenging the vermont constitutions requirement that judges 
retire at age 70 
justice louis peck turned 70 in december but refused to retire 
he maintains that the requirement violates the federal ban on age 
discrimination 
after several lawyers questioned pecks right to hear cases the 
administrator of vermonts courts put him on retirement status 
effective june 30 peck filed a complaint with the eeoc which sued 
in federal court late last week 
the state hired an outside lawyer to represent it because the 
state attorney general has sided with peck 
us district judge lee gagliardi who is himself 70 has told 
the parties he hopes to decide the case by june 30 gray said 
gagliardi is one of roughly 300 federal judges on senior status 
they are semiretired determine their own workload and handle about 
15 percent of federal cases federal judges can take senior status 
as early as age 65 
about a dozen states have mandatory retirement for judges 
a federal appeals court in massachusetts has upheld that states 
provision saying congress did not mean for the age discrimination 
in employment act to apply to appointed state judges but courts in 
other states have disagreed

a house subcommittee chairman released internal 
energy department documents that he said raised new doubts about the 
departments plan to open the nations first permanent nuclear waste 
dump in the new mexico desert 
rep mike synar dokla questioned how the department could 
meet its september target date for opening the waste isolation pilot 
plant a 700 million underground facility designed to entomb wastes 
from the manufacture of nuclear weapons contaminated with plutonium 
which remains radioactive for 24000 years 
at a meeting monday of the house subcommittee on environment 
energy and natural resources synar said the department was 
inviting failure by trying to overcome all the technical hurdles 
to opening the facility by september 
he suggested that it would be safer to put off the opening for 
some months 
the repository situated near carlsbad nm originally was to 
open last october it was put off because of delays in verifying 
that the design and construction are sound 
synar made public internal memorandums from energy department 
safety officers that he said indicated the department still was 
unable to provide assurances on the design and construction 
a memo dated june 1 from james p knight director of the 
departments office of safety appraisals said significant 
additional effort in ongoing staffing training procedure 
development and documentation is necessary before the department 
could approve opening the facility 
a similar note of caution was sounded by keith o fultz a 
general accounting office official who told the subcommittee hearing 
that his agencys review of the waste dump plan indicated the 
department has not yet satisfactorily addressed all key issues 
energy secretary james d watkins in a statement issued june 3 
said he still expected to open the waste dump in september for its 
5year experimental and test period 
watkins cautioned against inaccurate public alarm about 
progress at the waste site

neda said he himself was promoted to brigadier general shortly 
before coming to new delhi on march 23 
he said he served as secretary to the afghan supreme military 
council for the defense of the homeland a 20man group headed by 
najib 
the council assumed top government authority when najib declared 
a state of emergency on feb 18 three days after the soviet union 
announced it had ended its nine years of direct combat support for 
the afghan army in the war against usbacked moslem guerrillas 
najibs support in the party is not very good and if he did 
not have soviets attached to him he would not be able to survive 
neda said right now he has a very strong soviet support group 
and with this group is gen verinikov 
neda said he had never heard the soviet generals first name but 
had seen him and knew that he met top afghan military officials 
neda said he also had seen afghan military documents that said 
40000 soldiers defected from the 250000man army between sept 1 
and march 1 
other papers reaching the council said najibs government had 
nominal control of just 4000 of afghanistans officially 
recorded 36000 villages and 10000 other villages were destroyed 
and uninhabitable after a decade of civil war neda said 
the rest of the villages he added were controlled by or 
sympathetic to the mujahedeen islamic holy warriors who have been 
fighting to topple kabuls sovietstyle government for the past 
decade 
neda said he was a full member of the supreme military council 
his name however was not on the list of members announced by the 
government in february 
that is correct he said in response to a reporters 
question in the beginning of march i was promoted to this post 
his assertion could not be independently confirmed but the kabul 
government has a history of making appointments without public 
announcement 
neda said he had been one of four secretaries attached to the 
supreme defense council and was elevated to full council membership 
as a result of longtime association with vice president abdul rahim 
hatif a senior council member 
the 47yearold neda said he was not a combat soldier and had 
spent most of his military career in engineering and construction 
work before rising in the military bureaucracy 
nedas remarks were translated by said mohammad maiwand a 
selfexiled afghan who opposes the najib government and is at odds 
with most mujahedeen factions as well 
neda however understood some english and said he spent part of 
1978 in the united states on a military training course studying 
english at san antonio and engineering at fort belvoir va

vietnam told a un conference today that it needs 
money from other nations to stem the exodus of people fleeing the 
country and the united states said it would accept more of the boat 
people 
the conference attended by 60 countries is expected to endorse 
a proposal to reduce the number of vietnamese leaving their country 
for economic reasons and to promote regular emigration programs 
the plan will include screening procedures for all new arrivals 
in southeast asian coastal states to determine whether they are 
fleeing political persecution if they are they will be eligible 
for refugee status and resettlement 
the us deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger 
announced that over the next three years the united states will 
accept 22000 of the 55000 vietnamese now in refugee camps in 
addition the united states anticipates accepting up to half of all 
new arrivals granted refugee status he said 
vietnamese officials called on the united states to accept more 
refugees but it was not immediately clear if vietnamese officials 
were satisfied with the us commitment 
the number of boat people declined in the early 1980s but the 
exodus has accelerated again almost 90000 vietnamese three times 
the 1986 total now are living in refugee camps assisted by the un 
high commissioner for refugees 
another 100000 refugees from cambodia and laos live in the camps 
the japanese foreign ministry said today that 43 vietnamese 
refugees rescued by a united arab emirates tanker in the south 
china sea on june 4 arrived today at tomakomai a port on japans 
northernmost main island of hokkaido 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said fair 
international mechanisms must be found to deal with boat people 
while preserving the universal respect and preventing the abuse 
of the principle of asylum 
jeanpierre hocke the un high commissioner for refugees said 
the growing number of asylum seekers has caused an acute crisis 
in hong kong and poses a burden for other coastal state destinations 
of boat people 
foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam said one way to stop 
the exodus would be to grant international assistance to regions of 
his country that face serious economic difficulties and where 
illegal departures take place 
he said vietnam opposes the return of boat people who have been 
denied refugee status as urged by some countries 
eagleburger also said the united states will remain oppposed to 
forcing vietnamese refugees to return home unless and until 
dramatic improvements occur in that countrys economic social and 
political life 
australia will take up to 11000 vietnamese now in camps and a 
generous proportion of new arrivals provided other countries 
also participate in the un plan said foreign minister gareth 
evans

prime minister sousuke uno refused again today to 
answer questions by opposition lawmakers about a geisha who 
reportedly claimed she was paid to be his mistress 
a poll meanwhile showed his cabinet had one of the worst 
ratings of any new japanese government 
in an upper house budget committee session lawmakers questioned 
uno for a third day about a weekly magazines report quoting an 
unidentified 40yearold woman as saying uno paid her about 2100 a 
month for four months in 1985 to be his mistress 
socialist party member keiko chiba asked for an explanation and 
said unos vague attitude would jeopardize international trust 
in japan when he attends the paris meeting of major industrial 
democracies next month 
uno replied only that he would try to be worthy of being the 
sole representative from among asian countries and one of the 
advanced countries at the forum 
the report about the geisha was not covered by the poll on uno 
and his cabinet conducted friday and saturday by the national 
newspaper asahi shimbun 
the asahi said only 28 percent of those questioned in its 
nationwide poll supported the cabinet tying the previous low for a 
new cabinet that of takeo fukuda in 1977 
the asahi said the poor rating reflected public dissatisfaction 
with unos initial efforts at political reform in response to the 
recruit influencepeddling scandal the scandal involved dozens of 
prominent political figures and forced unos predecessor noboru 
takeshita to resign 
shortly before he left the prime minister post takeshitas 
approval rating had fallen below 4 percent in some polls 
uno 66 who was foreign minister under takeshita took office as 
prime minister on june 3 after the governing liberal democratic 
party chose him as its new leader because of his clean image the 
geisha reports came later 
the asahi also said 44 percent of the 2379 adults questioned in 
the poll indicated they opposed unos cabinet the highest 
nonsupport rate for any new cabinet in the 34 years the liberal 
democrats have been japans dominant party 
the asahi did not give a margin of error for the poll 
it said 73 percent of the respondents wanted uno to dissolve the 
house of representatives and call new general elections as early 
as possible another 13 percent opposed such a move the newspaper 
said 
opposition party leaders have called for early elections as a way 
for the voters to judge the ruling partys handling of the 
influencepeddling scandal 
prosecutors say that about 160 influential politicians 
businessmen and bureaucrats were offered bargainpriced unlisted 
shares in a real estate subsidiary of recruit co an 
informationpublishing giant purchasers reaped handsome profits by 
selling the shares after they went public in october 1986

commercialization of biomedical research in 
american universities is threatening the integrity of scientific 
institutions a congressional panel was told today 
sheldon krimsky associate professor of urban and environmental 
policy at tufts university testified before the human resources 
sucommittee of the house committee on government operations 
there have been changes in the social norms and values of 
biomedical scientists and their academic institutions krimsky 
said i believe some of these changes are detrimental to the 
general wellbeing of basic science and to the public interest 
biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within 
universities over a relatively short period of time he said i 
have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone 
gains from this marriage of academia and commerce nothing can be 
further from the truth 
not only are there losses but some of these losses threaten 
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public 
confidence in science 
he called for disclosure of financial interests related to 
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants 
david noble a professor of history at drexel university and a 
founding member of the national coalition for universities in the 
public interest said universy researchers are free to make 
undisclosed arrangements with private corporations in which they 
often have equally undisclosed personal roles 
they are free to shape and profit from the public investment in 
research and many have done so he said 
noble said collaboration between universities and industries may 
be useful but should be accompanied by proper disclosure and 
procedural safeguards 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the subcommittee said i 
am sure that many americans will be justifiably outraged by some of 
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold or 
manipulated for personal gain 
rep larkin smith of mississippi the ranking republican member 
of the panel said congress should send a strong signal to the 
research community that scientific misconduct will not be 
tolerated 
at the same time he said a careful balance must be struck 
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific 
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions we should not 
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way 
of overall progress

a rash of accidental shootings of 
children by children is being blamed on floridas liberal gun law 
and is renewing a push for legislation against leaving guns within 
reach of a youngster 
five shootings since june 1 involving children playing with guns 
at home have left two youngsters dead and one near death today 
gov bob martinez on monday said he will consider adding gun 
legislation to the agenda of a special summer session he wants to 
call on transportation matters 
theres been a series of tragic accidents here that has the 
people of florida very concerned said martinez 
under a bill proposed earlier this month by rep harry jennings 
leaving a firearm in reach of a child would be a misdemeanor it 
would be a felony carrying up to five years in prison if a child 
died or was maimed 
the bill which borrows language from the states 
abandonedrefrigerator law would require that guns be secured with 
a trigger lock or kept in a locked container 
a spokeswoman for the rifle association said the group would not 
oppose the bill if were amended to exclude shootings involving guns 
stolen from a home but she said the law would be superfluous 
we have laws on our books now that deal with child 
endangerment negligence culpable negligence and criminal 
negligence and there is recourse in the civil courts said marion 
hammer 
jennings said much of the problem results from floridas 1987 gun 
law which all but eliminated coolingoff periods for purchases 
banned local guncontrol ordinances and allowed most floridians to 
carry a concealed weapon 
jennings measure passed in the house during the recently 
completed regular session but the senate didnt take it up on 
monday senate president bob crawford said he would like to see the 
bill included in a special session 
anything that would encourage the family to be more aware of 
the dangers of leaving loaded guns in that setting id be 
willing to work with you on that he said 
some lawmakers expressed reservations 
you cant legislate against all tragedy said rep lois 
frankel why would the threat of going to jail be any more a 
deterrent to carelessness than having your child killed 
the latest shooting victim 4yearold silvio pierre was listed 
in very critical condition today at tampa general hospital he had 
found his fathers 25caliber pistol under a living room chair 
sunday police said 
no statewide statistics on such accidents are kept said linda 
booz information specialist for the florida department of law 
enforcement

competitive elections under communist rule 
the hungarian talks are to set the stage for free elections that 
will be held by mid1990 at the latest 
communist party leader karoly grosz told the evening daily esti

the talks were opened by parliament speaker matyas szueros who 
presided over the opening round in budapests ornate parliament 
building and briefly addressed the negotiators

multiparty system the state news agency mti reported 
the government and opposition on saturday agreed to hold the 
talks 
also participating are the official trade unions and the 
leftwing ferenc muennich society which opposes a change in the 
oneparty system the nine opposition groups initially wanted the 
communist party organizations left out of the meetings but later 
agreed to their participation

reforms he said in the case of a split the party would likely 
fall to pieces

in the city of gyoer that a real danger of a split exists 
grosz said there were differences among party factions over the 
pace of reforms and hungarys foreign policy orientation

the government today further 
restricted the movements of antiapartheid leaders and prevented 
them from participating in peace talks to end factional fighting in 
zululand 
more than 500 people have received restriction orders that 
interfere with their freedom of movement and prohibit them from 
addressing public meetings or being quoted in the press the 
ministry of law and order said 
and many were further restricted after president pw botha 
renewed the 4yearold state of emergency on friday 
those included members of the united democratic front which had 
scheduled peace talks this week in natal province to end factional 
fighting among antiapartheid groups that has left 1500 dead since 
1986 
we cannot interpret this as anything other than a deliberate 
attempt to perpetuate the divisions which have caused such frightful 
bloodshed in natal said anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
govan mbeki 79 an official with the african national congress 
the main south african guerrilla organization today was restricted 
to his apartment from 6 pm to 6 am he had already been banned 
from speaking to the press addressing public gatherings and leaving 
the new brighton township without permission 
the restrictions will stop him from participating in the united 
democratic front peace talks with the zulu group inkatha 
on monday archie gumede 75 a copresident of the united 
democratic front in natal was placed under house arrest from 8 pm 
to 5 am daily he was already prohibited from talking to the 
press addressing public gatherings or helping to prepare material 
for publication 
the fronts other copresident albertina sisulu is under 
similar restrictions as are most executive members of the 
antiapartheid coalition 
the groups leaders have frequently accused police of trying to 
sabotage the peace talks and of encouraging violence in the natal 
townships rather than trying to subdue it 
for more than 18 months natal and national church leaders have 
been trying to bring to an end the conflict between political rivals 
in the province tutu said during this period the government 
has acted only to hamper the process never to help it

thousands of ethnic turks deported from 
bulgaria have poured across the border in the past three weeks 
leaving behind what they say is a nightmare of government 
persecution officials said today 
since may 26 when bulgaria started the deportations the number 
of arrivals has reached 16297 the foreign ministry said today 
tent cities are being erected in a hurry 
as if they the bulgarians are trying to test the strength and 
power of the turkish state they are sending wave after wave of 
people to the border cabinet minister ercument konukman told 
reporters 
publicly premier turgut ozal has said turkey will accept all 
deported ethnic turks but officials say turkeys resources will be 
severely strained if the forced exodus from bulgaria continues 
the present wave of immigration comes at a time when turkey is 
hard pressed with other refugee problems 
in august 50000 kurds fleeing iraqi attacks crossed the border 
into turkey about 35000 of them remain housed in tent cities and 
crowded apartment buildings in southeastern turkey 
according to official estimates turkey is also home to 600000 
iranians who fled the islamic revolution or the war with iraq and 
settled in turkish cities principally istanbul 
bulgaria began deporting ethnic turks after unrest in the 
northeastern and southern regions last month many deported led 
resistance to a forced assimilation campaign that began in 1983 and 
includes changing ethnic turks moslem names to slavic ones 
also under the campaign sofia barred the public use of the 
turkish language and practice of islamic religious rites 
deportees said police attacked ethnic turks at late may 
demonstrations against the campaign with dogs and clubs killing 
about 40 people 
turkey has proposed negotiations with bulgaria to hammer out an 
immigration agreement that would allow ethnic turks to dispose of 
their property and bring out liquid assets deportees have said they 
were not allowed to take with them more than a suitcase 
bulgaria claims the moslem minority numbers 780000 while turkish 
officials put it at 25 million in the total population of 9 million 
through defections and immigration agreements 38000 ethnic 
turks have come to turkey since 1925

president bush standing 
against the backdrop of the majestic grand tetons declared today 
that environmental gridlock must end and appealed to the public 
and congress to unite behind his plan to clean americas polluted 
air 
invoking the memories of past presidents who created the national 
parks bush said his clean air initiative marks a new chapter in 
the tradiion of protecting our people and their parks 
he made the remarks in a speech at the teton science school an 
outdoor education center located inside this 310000acre 
mountainous preserve bush spoke on a brilliant morning in a field 
where bison roam in the winter with the 13770foot grand teton 
mountain behind him in the distance the tallest peak in the 
40mile snowcapped range 
bush who visited the stillblackened expanse of yellowstone 
national park before arriving here monday for an evening of fishing 
with his grandson said nature needs our help 
today with my back to the pacific and the jewels of the 
american rockies i look east across this fertile and productive 
land and call on the american people and on congress to join me 
in this new initiative for clean air said bush an avid 
outdoorsman who has treked through the tetons in the past 
recalling his meetings with environmental and industry groups 
before putting the finishing touches on the package he unveiled 
monday bush said no group is going to get everything it wants 
some say were asking too much too fast others say not enough too 
slow 
but now he said theres one thing everyone agrees on we need 
action and we need it now 
every american deserves to breath clean air and you shouldnt 
have to drive two thousand miles here to do it environmental 
gridlock must end he declared 
national park service police removed several demonstrators from 
the site before bush arrived they had signs denouncing bushs 
handling of the valdez oil spill jim northup of the national park 
service said they were arrested for demonstrating in a national park 
without a permit they were taken to teton county jail 
bush also announced he is nominating wyoming state sen john 
turner as director of the us fish and wildlife service turner a 
past senate president and his family own triangle x dude ranch in 
grand teton park 
bush said creating national parks was an american idea and 
it was one of our best from abraham lincoln who granted yosemite 
valley to california to teddy roosevelt who made the environment a 
hallmark of his presidency past presidents have done their part to 
help americans enjoy their natural heritage bush said 
his new plan is aimed at improving and preserving the very air 
we breathe for another five generations and beyond bush said 
even the tetons the heart of an environmental success 
storycannot escape the threat of pollution he said 
it can follow you here but the good news is were not going 
to put up with it any longer he said 
later bush was flying to lincoln neb to underscore his 
support for alternative fuels research 
earlier in the east room of the white house bush had unveiled a 
clean air package that he promised would cut acid raincausing 
sulfur dioxide emissions in half by the year 2000 
the initiative drew applause from industrialists 
environmentalists and lawmakers alike with some reservations 
environmental leaders hailed his stance on acid rain but 
questioned whether the plan was tough enough on smog and toxic 
industrial pollutants 
sen robert byrd dwva and coal lobbyists said it would put 
highsulfur coal areas at a disadvantage 
bush promised that his legislative package will be 
costeffective but above all it will work we will make the 1990s 
the era for clean air 
with a nod to congress but not a word about his predecessor 
ronald reagans failure to press the topic bush said weve seen 
enough of this stalemate its time to clear the air and you know 
i think we will 
the president is banking on the sale of 1 million 
methanolpowered cars a year by 1997 to help rid americas big 
cities of smog 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters on air 
force one that bush hopes to sign a clean air bill by the fall 
environmental protection agency administrator william k reilly 
estimated the overall program would cost between 14 billion and 19 
billion a year after it is in full effect at the turn of the century 
sununu said the stiffer standards would add 5 to 10 percent to 
utility rates in 18 states that burn high sulfur coal and contribute 
the most to the acid rain problem but he said their rates would 
still fall below the national average

a house ways and means subcommittee today 
approved extension of expiring tax benefits for employers who hire 
disadvantaged workers and for those who invest in lowincome housing 
the revenue subcommittee also renewed a tax credit that 
encourages rehabilitation of old buildings and approved a major 
simplification of the corporate minimum tax 
the four measures now go to the full ways and means committee 
whether they face further scrutiny rep charles rangel dny 
chairman of the subcommittee on select revenue measures emphasized 
that the minimumtax bill almost certainly will be modified by the 
parent panel 
the bills would 
extend through 1992 the targetedjobs tax credit under which 
the government in effect pays up to 2400 of the firstyear wages 
paid economically disadvantaged workers especially vietnamera 
veterans and those aged 18 through 22 this would cost the 
government 647 million over the next five years 
renew through 1992 with some modifications the credit for 
investment in housing for lowincome americans this would cost more 
than 3 billion over five years 
extend through 1992 at a cost of 145 million a credit for 
rehabilitation of historic and other older buildings the credit is 
for 10 percent of costs associated with nonresidential buildings 
built before 1936 and 20 percent for rehabilitation of certified 
historic structures 
drop one complex step involving adjusted current earnings 
from the calculations by which corporations determine their 
liability for the minimum tax aides said the version approved by 
the subcommittee avoids all but 100 million of the fiveyear 42 
billion revenue loss that had been estimated for the original bill

afternoon or early this evening plant spokesman ron sher said 
the 6 billion reactor won a lowpower testing license last month 
after years of delay and protests that made the plant a symbol of 
antinuclear activism and forced its chief owner into bankruptcy 
court 
plant officials hope to win a commercial license by the end of 
the year 
plant officials had hoped to start atomic operations as early as 
a week ago but were stymied by a malfunctioning valve in the 
emergency cooling system the systems valves worked properly in 
tests early monday sher said

britain will do all it can to stop the poaching of 
africas endangered black rhinoceroses environment minister lord 
caithness said tuesday 
but he also called on individuals to help end the illegal trade 
in rhinoceros horns 
we will certainly do at the government level what we can 
because this is a very serious question caithness said at the 
launch of an appeal fund for the charity rhino rescue a 
government can only do a certain amount people pressure rather 
than government pressure is the solution 
caithness gave no specific examples of what the government would 
do 
the black rhino is threatened because poachers can sell a single 
horn for as much as 25000 
the horns are used as traditional medicines and aphrodisiacs in 
asia and as ceremonial dagger handles in the middle east 
only about 4000 black rhinos remain in africa compared with an 
estimated 65000 in 1970

from charlie chaplin and ginger 
rogers to steven spielberg and robert redford some of hollywoods 
most sacred heroes and villains drew large crowds for three weeks in 
this filmloving capital 
nearly 100000 people flocked to a us governmentsponsored film 
exhibit waiting for hours in line for a ticket to such films as 
cinderella sophies choice and silverado 
the exhibit which opened may 18 and ended sunday is the first 
american film show in communist czechoslovakia it will appear in 
bratislava in september as part of a usczechoslovak cultural 
agreement 
six films were shown at eight screenings a day at three different 
sites in pkojf pragues largest amusement park the most popular 
movie according to organizers was sophies choice 
i wish we had more shows like this and more often one man

the exhibit has toured many east european capitals since it was 
launched in 1984 and total viewership is estimated at 700000 show 
officials said 
also on display were posters original costumes photos and other 
items 
a photo of czechborn filmmaker milos forman invited visitors to 
the corner of famous czechs who made it in hollywood featuring

ended the prague spring reforms and won five oscars with one 
flew over the cuckoos nest 
the average age of those who came here most was between 15 and

a bingo operation that grossed 562000 
in the name of a tiny church did so without authorization and turned 
over none of the proceeds the pastor says 
the use of the name of st cyprians catholic church is without 
authorization or even fraudulent said the rev john bench 
bingo is illegal in south carolina unless sponsored by a 
taxexempt organization with the profits going to charity 
an operation headed by richard webster president of charities 
consultants has used a permit in the name of the church charities 
consultants runs bingo games in the names of 51 charities webster 
would not comment about the permit 
the bingo operation in st cyprians name has taken in 562000 
since last july from games at myrtle beach state records show it 
has paid out 420000 in prizes leaving 142000 for expenses and 
profit 
bench overseer of st cyprian since july said he does not know 
webster and has not been able to find any records of bingo income 
over the past five years he said monday he has requested a state 
tax commission investigation 
benchs predecessor the rev thomas a evatt said a webster 
associate agreed to pay the church 200 to 400 a month for use of 
the name he said there was no written contract and he did not know 
how much the games took in 
apparently the operation was bigger than i thought he said 
evatt said that when he left st cyprians last year he did not 
inform bench about the bingo games but assumed the game operators 
would 
when i took over st cyprians it was absolutely bankrupt and 
thats why i checked the records bench said st cyprian has 100 
members and a monthly offering of about 600 church officials said 
earlier this year south carolina bishop ernest unterkoefler 
banned bingo as inappropriate for raising money for diocesan 
churches and schools but he said games operating on church premises 
can continue until july 1990

for the young photographer the decision to go 
underground wasnt hard last week police with rifles burst through 
the door to his house 
he had been warned beforehand by a neighbor and now is living on 
the run his appearance changed by a haircut shave some weight 
loss and rugged workers clothes replacing his light polyester 
shirts 
i am a new man he said laughing heartily in a small 
restaurant at his first sitdown meal in a week a new communist 
man 
the photographer a communist party member from beijing is one 
of hundreds of people wanted by police for participation in a 
movement for freedom some of the wanted are wellknown their faces 
appearing on television 
on tuesday night a nationally televised news program showed 
photographs with biographical information of 21 student leaders 
being sought by the government the photographer was not among them 
his alleged crimes are vague during the seven weeks of chinas 
prodemocracy demonstrations leading up to the june 34 killings by 
the army he took thousands of photos of marchers hoping to 
chronicle the movement one day 
he spent much time with the students and even wore a white 
headband that read hunger strike for freedom when the peoples 
liberation army stormed beijing the photographer was there 
snapping pictures as bullets cut down friends and classmates 
soldiers detained him briefly on june 4 
my mind was so clear at that moment i convinced them to let me 
go when i walked away from the barracks people came up to me 
weve heard gunshots from there all day they said we thought 
youd been executed also he recounted 
now he says he moves from dormitory rooms to friends apartments 
last night my old girlfriend took me in before that it was my 
high school teacher tonight i dont know where ill be id like to 
get out of beijing he said 
leaving beijing is difficult troops and police fill the railroad 
station searching baggage and interrogating passengers about their 
destinations staterun news reports say more than 70 prodemocracy 
activists have been arrested fleeing the capital 
i went down there to get a ticket but i saw troops take two 
students away he said the soldiers surrounded these guys and 
smacked one in the head with a rifle butt i was too scared to wait 
around 
a martial law regulation requires citizens to turn in anyone 
suspected of participating in the prodemocracy campaign telephone 
lines have opened throughout the city for use by informants 
the thing that scares me is that people seem to be listening to 
the governments order telling us to report on each other he 
said we chinese like to tell on people maybe some one is jealous 
and wants my cameras maybe they want to get ahead and need to 
report someone it doesnt have to be for political reasons 
despite the governments steppedup efforts to track down 
activists in the democratic movement the photographer was confident 
he could make it out of beijing safely 
a few days ago i was down life was dark he said but 
today i woke up and everything had lifted from me i just want to go 
far away find a place in the mountains and hide a while 
the meal ended and he got on his bicycle he turned west at one 
corner looked back over his shoulder and smiled

the design for a longsought 6 million korean 
war veterans memorial being unveiled wednesday depicts soldiers 
heading down a treelined path into battle according to sources 
familiar with the plan 
architects of the project to be built across the reflecting pool 
from the vietnam veterans memorial also contemplate a wall 
containing inscriptions about the war 
no one involved in the memorial from the designers to the 
veterans of foreign wars and other sponsors anticipates the 
controversy that surrounded the vietnam memorial at its veterans day 
dedication in 1982 
a vocal group backed by theninterior secretary james watt 
opposed the vietnam project as unheroic the group won a concession 
when a statue of three battleweary soldiers was added in 1984 to 
the memorials vshaped wall bearing the names of those killed in 
vietnam 
a oneeighth scale model of the korean memorial is being unveiled 
at a white house ceremony on wednesday 
the four designers said they could not describe the project until 
then but several government and nongovernment sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity described a succession of granite or bronze 
soldiers intended to collectively depict a transition from the 
anxious but brave entrance into war to combat to returning home 
four pennsylvania state university architects were named by a 
jury of korean war veterans two weeks ago as the winners of a 
national contest to design the memorial they described their entry 
a combination of sculpture architecture and landscape design 
all of the 1019 competitors for the 20000 first prize were 
guided by a memorial concept conveyed to them by the korean war 
veterans advisory board which was responsible for picking the 
winner and raising funds some of the 6 million has yet to be 
raised and it is uncertain when the memorial will be completed 
the purposes of the memorial according to the american battle 
monuments commission include expressing the the enduring 
gratitude of the american people for all who took part in that war 
under our flag 
the memorial is also to project in most positive fashion the 
spirit of service the willingness to sacrifice and the dedication 
to the cause of freedom that characterized all participants 
some 57 million americans served in korea during the 195053 
conflict more than 54000 were killed roughly the same number 
killed in vietnam the war began after the soviettrained north 
korean army crossed the 38th parallel into south korea and ended 
with a truce on july 27 1953 
i didnt know a lot about it we heard about it from relatives 
uncles and such said john paul lucas one of the penn state 
designers the designers who interviewed many korean war veterans 
for the project range in age from their 30s to their early 50s 
the project is unlikely to cause the stir created by the vietnam 
memorial said veronica burns lucas who is one of the four 
designers and is lucas wife 
to the general population its not likely to cause 
controversy we hope thats the case she said but we werent 
looking to make a noncontroversial memorial we were thinking in 
terms of meeting the stated purpose and creating a significant 
experience for anyone visiting to evoke an awareness on the part of 
any visitor 
korean war veterans have lobbied for a memorial since 1982 and 
at one time a group was pushing for a design by felix de weldon who 
designed the iwo jima monument congress passed legislation last 
year to erect the privately financed memorial on the mall 
contributors to the memorial include the vfw and the american 
subsidiary of hyundai motor co 
even before seeing the design vfw spokesman bill smith said the 
detailed screening process left him confident that the final product 
would have the 100 percent support of the veterans group

a survey of employee health plans shows nearly 
60 percent of employers who offer health insurance have had aids 
cases among workers or covered dependents but just 25 percent have 
formal aids policies 
an overwhelming majority of employers surveyed 92 percent said 
they had not modified their medical benefits plans because of aids 
but 3 percent said they had altered the plan and 5 percent planned 
to do so by the end of this year 
of those employers who had or planned to modify benefit plans 56 
percent said the changes included or would include an aids education 
campaign 48 percent said they had or would limit coverage and 23 
percent added or planned to add preemployment testing for the virus 
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the survey conducted by benefits consultant foster higgins last 
august and released this week gathered information on medical 
benefits policy from more than 1600 employers with work forces 
ranging from 700 people to more than 40000 employees combined the 
employers surveyed had more than 10 million workers 
not all employers answered all of the questions in the survey 
some simply chose not to do so while some questions were not 
applicable to certain employers so the sample group varied from 
issue to issue the employers surveyed represent a broad spectrum of 
us industry and business and were from every region of the 
country 
of 651 employers who responded when asked about cases of aids 
among employees or dependents covered by their health plans 58 
percent said yes and 42 percent said no the average number 
of aids cases reported was four 
employers in the midatlantic region were most likely to report 
at least one aids case among workers or plancovered dependents 73 
percent reported at least one case while employers in the north 
central region of the country 12 midwestern states were least 
likely to report aids among workers or their dependents with 47 
percent reporting cases 
communications and transportation services were the industries 
with the highest rate of employerreported aids cases among workers 
and insured dependents with 82 percent of employers in those fields 
reporting at least one aids case covered by their benefit plans the 
lowest rate was reported by employers in health care services 30 
percent of whom reported at least one case of aids covered by their 
medical insurance 
not surprisingly larger employers were more likely to have 
workers or dependents with aids than smaller employers 
twentyone percent of employers with fewer than 1000 workers 
reported at least one aids case among employees or their dependents 
while 89 percent of employers with 10000 to 19999 employees 
reported cases 96 percent with 20000 to 39999 workers reported 
cases and 98 percent of employers with 40000 or more employees 
reported cases

president raul alfonsin says 
economic chaos is forcing him to resign five months before his term 
ends and presidentelect carlos menem said today he is willing to 
assume office early 
we are willing totally willing to assume the direction of the 
argentine republic on that date and my hope is that the president 
of the nation will put on me the presidential sash menem told 
radio america 
alfonsin said monday evening he would leave office on june 30 
because of argentinas economic crisis and his inability to handle 
it given his partys loss to menem in the may national elections 
the governments room for action during the months that remain 
of its mandate is too narrow to face the problems with a chance for 
success alfonsin told the nation in a televised address 
but menem a populist champion of the working poor said he was 
taken by surprise by the announcement and said it would be 
impossible for him to take office five months early he said 
that it require legislation that could not be enacted in time 
it looked likely at that point that menems younger brother 
eduardo who is provisional president of the senate would act as 
interim president until menems change of heart today 
the sixyear term of alfonsin whose civilian administration 
replaced a discredited military dictatorship officially ends dec 
10 
alfonsins address followed days of talks between the governing 
radical civic union and menems peronist party 
on may 14 the peronist party won the presidency for just the 
second time in 34 years and attained virtual control of both houses 
of congress the party already controled legislatures in 17 of 
argentinas 22 provinces 
because menem 58 and alfonsin 62 have disagreed on how to 
improve the economy little has been done to curtail inflation 
which hit 785 percent in may interest rates and unemployment also 
continue to rise 
the economic problems have been fueled by argentinas 59 billion 
foreign debt problems in repaying the debt and meeting demands by 
foreign creditors also caused rioting in venezuela in february and 
have been blamed for instability in brazil peru and other latin 
american nations 
the independent news agency diarios y noticias cited another 
reason for the resignation of alfonsin who had been barred by the 
constitution from seeking a second term 
it quoted unidentified government sources as saying menem was 
trying to pressure alfonsin into granting amnesty to officers who 
led three barracks revolts during his tenure and to others convicted 
of human rights abuses during the military dictatorships dirty 
war against leftists from 197683 
the insistence prompted the government to decide to 
announce its departure dyn quoted the sources as saying 
alfonsin does not want an amnesty 
a former president and army commander gen jorge videla and 
seven other top officers were convicted of human rights abuses 
committed during the sevenyear dictatorship when at least 8961 
people were arrested never seen again and presumed executed human 
rights groups claim the death toll is much higher 
the armed forces claims it used unconventional tactics to fight 
an unconventional enemy and save argentinas democracy 
the military returned to the barracks after presiding over an 
economic collapse losing the 1982 falklands war to britain and 
encountering worldwide condemnation over its human rights policies

a possible plan for establishing an 
autonomous ethnic german settlement in the soviet union has ignited 
hopes for stemming the westward flow of soviet germans 
soviet officials have given contradictory reports on the 
likelihood of a german region emerging a designated zone that could 
trade freely with the west would offer a unique foundation on which 
to build sovietgerman business ties 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told journalists 
covering soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs visit to bonn that 
one proposal calls for establishing an ethnic german region in 
kaliningrad 
now a pocket of the russian republic wedged between poland and 
soviet lithuania on the baltic coast kaliningrad was known as 
koenigsberg prior to its transfer to soviet control after world war 
ii 
as the kremlin has relaxed restrictions on the emigration of 
those with german ancestry tens of thousands of ethnic germans have 
abandoned their soviet homes to settle in west germany 
many of the emigres stem from german settlers who went to russia 
300 years ago in the time of peter the great and their assimilation 
into modern west german society has been difficult and costly for 
the bonn government 
west germanys constitution recognizes a right by all people of 
german nationality to return to their homeland and massive outlays 
for housing language instruction and work training have been 
necessary to help the soviet germans get settled 
about 50000 soviet germans arrived in west germany in 1988 
asked if the idea of an autonomous region for soviet germans came 
up during gorbachevs talks with west german leaders monday bonn 
government spokesman hans klein said it had not but he added the 
subject lies close to the heart of west german chancellor helmut 
kohl 
i can assure you this development will be a very important 
subject in the discussions to be conducted klein said 
gerasimov said the idea of an autonomous german region within the 
soviet union is one of a number of possibilities under 
discussion as a means of helping those of german origin to retain 
their ethnic traditions 
a designated autonomous region for soviet jews was established in 
the siberian region of birobidzhan in the 1930s but today its 
jewish population is a minority 
large groups of soviet germans are settled in the central asian 
republic of kazakhstan where they were forcibly relocated from the 
volga region and bessarabia by dictator josef stalin before and 
during world war ii 
gerasimov said earlier that one idea under discussion as a means 
of improving conditions for soviet germans is to allow them to 
establish their own region within the country 
he said one location under consideration is the kaliningrad area 
because it is relatively undeveloped and sparcely populated 
kaliningrad remains a closed region within the soviet union 
presumably because it has a number of strategic naval bases on the 
baltic coast 
gerasimov said officials looking into ways of countering the 
trend toward emigration came up with the proposal and that they 
have even put forward a possible name for the region 
they could call it kantograd he said in honor of the 18th 
century german philosopher immanuel kant the most famous figure to 
have emerged from the region 
however a communist party central committee adviser on german 
affairs suggested the idea of an autonomous german zone within the 
soviet union remains speculative 
everyone has the right to speculate on how to solve problems 
but there is no such formal proposal said nikolai portugalov 
also in bonn for the summit 
establishing a special german zone would give west germans eager 
to help develop a stronger trade base in the soviet union a logical 
place to invest in joint ventures or other cooperative endeavors 
but a freetrading autonomous region on the baltic coast might be 
troubling to neighboring poland as well as nato members who might 
view a sovietgerman region as a precarious attraction for west 
germany 
it could also be negative for moscow since it would almost 
certainly boost the resolve of the baltic republics to gain 
independence from the kremlin

fortyfour veterans hospitals had 
significantly elevated rates of death among patients and more 
than five percent of those who died were found to have received 
inappropriate care according to a department of veterans affairs 
report issued today 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski who ordered the 
report released today cautioned in a letter to congress that no 
general statement about the quality of care in veterans hospitals 
can be drawn from these findings 
nonetheless derwinski said we must try to do better 
the report is based on a review of 1771 deaths in 1986 among 
patients at the 172 va medical centers around the country medical 
records for the dead patients were reviewed by several levels of 
evaluators and judged against a scale of predicted death based on 
several factors such as patient age condition and type of illness 
from this study the report concludes that 44 medical centers had 
significantly elevated mortality rates for at least one of four 
patient categories twelve of these 44 centers had overall death 
rates that were significantly elevated fifteen of the va 
medical centers were judged to have mortality rates lower than 
expected 
evaluators ordered 123 of the 1771 cases to be reviewed by a 
group of doctors not associated with the va hospitals a system 
called peer review 
of the 123 cases examined in detail two groups of peer reviewers 
found 90 cases in which the care given was not consistent with 
current medical practice 
the agreement of two peer reviewers on these 90 cases makes it 
appropriate to describe them as having likely quality of care 
problems the report said 
the va hospitals with higherthanpredicted death rates were 
identified as those veterans medical centers in these cities

after 10 years of conservative government by prime 
minister margaret thatcher it has been a while since her opponents 
have relished an election 
but this is it 
in the campaign for the european economic communitys 
parliamentary elections thursday the labor party has surged ahead 
the tories are on the defensive and theres only one issue mrs 
thatcher 
labor has turned the election into a referendum on the thatcher 
decade with emphasis on the charge that she is a reluctant 
european fighting each step toward a europe that conforms in 
everything from a single currency to the size of health warnings on 
cigarette packs 
the conservatives also face strong challenges in byelections 
thursday to fill two vacant british parliamentary seats in glasgow 
and london 
in the european elections british voters will choose 78 
representatives to the 518member parliament the bodys limited 
powers include approving trade agreements involving eec members 
the elections come as mrs thatcher is taking on the communitys 
administrative headquarters in brussels which she says wants to 
impose socialism by the back door on the 12nation eec 
she is particularly angered by a proposed eec social charter 
that would provide for europewide minimum wages and worker 
representation in industry 
we have not rolled back the frontiers of socialism in this 
country to see them reimposed from brussels she said at an 
election rally on friday 
labor wring their hands and protest that were far too 
combative she said what do they want a doormat 
the audience cheered 
but the government is in increasing trouble over strikes and 
rising inflation labor recently revamped its platform moving to 
the center and dropping its policy of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament a big voteloser now the party is on the attack 
so is mrs thatchers tory predecessor edward heath an ardent 
european who accuses her of misleading the public with absolute 
nonsense about moves toward socialism by the european commission 
that governs the eec 
some less prominent conservatives also are uneasy about the 
thatcher style in europe 
should we really have to block every european commission 
proposal on principle said michael welsh a tory member of the 
european parliament it simply isnt true that a lot of leftist 
loonies are running the show 
the economist a respected weekly said mrs thatchers prickly 
attitude toward continental europe could backfire on britains 
strong friendship with the united states 
for the americans it is no use having a special relationship 
with a sulky outsider the economist said 
many europeans believe mrs thatcher is a british nationalist who 
is only interested in the eecs economic benefits 
she responds that she dares to say aloud what others secretly 
believe that the united states of europe is a pipe dream 
in britain bashing what mrs thatcher still calls the 
europeans has never been a voteloser the tories balancesheet 
approach to europe is reflected in their main newspaper campaign ad 
which crows that since 1984 the tory government has won about 76 
billion in refunds from eec coffers 
the bulk of the refunds came after britain won arguments over the 
size of its contributions to the eec 
defending mrs thatcher kenneth minogue professor of politics 
at the london school of economics said she just doesnt want a 
highly regulated mercantilist absolutist fortress europe thats 
what shes attacking 
in the last european election in 1984 the conservatives won 45 
of mainland britains 78 seats in the strasbourg parliament labor 
32 and the scottish nationalist party one 
this time analysts expect the conservatives to lose four to five 
seats to the socialists 
the latest gallup poll a huge survey of 9000 voters gave labor 
435 percent of the vote a 7point lead over the conservatives and 
the opposition partys highest rating for eight years 
all parties share the biggest battle of all in a european vote in 
this island nation apathy which in the 1984 euroelection produced 
the lowest turnout in the eec 32 percent 
but gallup showed labor with a 15point lead among those who said 
they were certain to vote

sluggish automobile and department store 
purchases slowed the pace of retail sales in may to a weak 01 
percent increase the government reported tuesday and analysts said 
they do not expect much improvement soon 
i think this is what the pattern will be like as we look 
forward said lawrence chimerine an economist with the wefa group 
in bala cynwyd pa i dont think youll see a big retrenchment 
but there wont be much growth in consumer spending for several 
years 
allen sinai an econmist with the boston co agreed saying i 
think it the retail sales report reinforces what is now and 
probably will continue to be a much more cautious consumer 
throughout the balance of the business expansion 
the commerce department said retail sales increased to 1411 
billion on a seasonally adjusted basis last month after rising a 
strong 1 percent in april and 01 percent in march 
but the april increase included a 2 percent boost in auto sales 
due to rebates and low interest rates designed to lure buyers into 
dealer showrooms despite the extension of the incentives into may 
car sales increased only 02 percent last month auto sales rose 
only 05 percent in march 
autos represent about 20 percent of all retail sales 
also hit by the slowing economy were department store and general 
merchandise sales which fell 12 percent in may following an 08 
percent rise in april 
specialty clothing sales were off 14 percent after a 39 percent 
jump the preceeding month 
the economy has been slowing and until recently interest rates 
rising as the federal reserve applied the brakes in an attempt to 
stem inflation but as inflation seemed to slow and amid worries the 
economy could slide into a recession the fed slightly eased 
pressures on interest rates this month 
nevertheless analysts say interest rates and inflation continue 
to be a factor in consumer spending also in recent years 
consumers have taken on a large amount of debt to buy cars and other 
bigticket durable items expected to last more than three years 
some of the huge pentup demand for cars and other durables 
which existed five or six years ago has been used up to some 
extent chimerine said people borrowed heavily and spent for a 
number of years and now were on the down side of that cycle and it 
could take a long time before we see a major revival in spending 
the commerce department said sales of durable goods rose 03 
percent in may down from a 18 percent hike in april that included 
the incentivedriven boost in auto sales nondurable goods sales 
were level in may after a 06 percent increase the previous month 
sales in the food and grocery store category were up 05 percent 
in may gasoline service stations up 09 percent and drug stores 
up 18 percent 
bar and restaurant sales were down 04 percent while building 
material and furniture sales were flat 
the department said overall retail sales were up 5 percent for 
the three months from march through may compared with the same 
period of 1988

ronald reagan said tuesday that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev is possibly his countrys only hope for change 
and we should take the risk of believing he is serious about 
arms control 
of china the former president said the chinese government 
hasnt learned something very elementary you cant massacre an 
idea you cannot run tanks over hope you cannot riddle a peoples 
yearning with bullets 
reagan was addressing the english speaking union in the 
guildhall the 1000yearold seat of london city government where 
he spoke as president 13 months ago and where gorbachev gave a 
speech in april 
reagan on his first visit to britain since leaving the white 
house mixed jokes and reminiscences with a sweeping vision of a 
world where the goliath of totalitarian control will rapidly be 
brought down by the david of the microchip 
i believe mikhail gorbachev realizes these things said 
reagan 
i believe mikhail gorbachev is the soviets best and probably 
only hope to turn things around 
it is true that the west could stand pat while this is 
happening we are not the ones who must change it is not our people 
whore isolated from the information that allows them to be creative 
and productive he said 
but it is exactly when you are strong and comfortable that you 
should take risks 
he said i believe we should take the risk that the soviets 
are serious in their efforts to reach genuine arms reductions with 
the west i support president bushs proposal to keep pressure on 
the soviets to make good on their calls to reduce arms 
the biggest of big brothers is increasingly helpless against 
communications technology he said 
information is the oxygen of the modern age it seeps 
through the walls topped with barbed wire it wafts across the 
electrified boobytrapped borders breezes of electronic beams blow 
through the iron curtain as if it was lace 
he said that as long as the soviets restricted the flow by such 
measures as banning the unauthorized use of photocopiers the west 
should go on refusing to sell the soviets modern computers 
when the soviets are willing to allow their own people to have 
computers and telephones and copiers and the other devices of 
information then we should rethink our objections to what well 
sell them reagan said 
amazing things are afoot in the world this spring he said 
poland had held its first semifree election in 40 years hungary 
was moving to multiparty democracy soviet dissident andrei sakharov 
sat in parliament and in china those heroic chinese students who 
gave their lives have released the spirit of democracy and it cannot 
be called back reagan said 
answering a reporters question about china as he left the 
guildhall reagan said i think the students were right and we 
should do everything we can to help 
in his speech reagan joked about the pleasures of addressing an 
englishspeaking audience recalling an embarrassing episode in 
mexico when he enthusiastically applauded a speech in spanish which 
he didnt understand only to discover that he was listening to the 
translation of the speech he had just given 
another joke was about east german leader erich hoenecker meeting 
a beautiful woman and offering to grant her every wish she asks him 
to tear down the berlin wall to which he replies i know you 
want to be alone with me 
burkes peerage which chronicles the british aristocracy said 
reagan has accepted the offer of an honorary knighthood the highest 
royal honor britain bestows on americans but buckingham palace and 
reagans press spokesman mark weinberg refused to confirm or deny 
the report 
after dinner with prime minister margaret thatcher on tuesday 
night reagan and his wife nancy are to have lunch with queen 
elizabeth ii at the palace wednesday 
we understand it has been offered and will be accepted either 
this trip or his next trip which is expected to be next spring 
said harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage

a star wars experiment to test how a neutral 
particle beam accelerator would work in space was aborted tuesday 
when a rocket failed to ignite on command 
pete williams the pentagons chief spokesman said the socalled 
bear experiment at white sands missile range in new mexico had been 
postponed until next month while technicians tried to determine what 
went wrong 
there was a problem with the aires booster williams said 
the missile did not fire and thats all i can tell you about that 
and so the launch was aborted the strategic defense initiative 
organization hopes to reschedule the launch for midjuly 
the bear or beam experiment aboard rocket has been planned 
for more than a year and is considered a key step in the pentagons 
research to explore futuristic weapons that could shoot powerful 
beams of atomic particles across space 
the experiment involved the lifting into space just for a few 
minutes of a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small aires 
rocket before the rocket returned to earth the accelerator would 
be turned on and scientists would collect data on how it worked and 
how the particle beams moved 
the total flight was to last only about 15 minutes 
the star wars office at the pentagon said tuesday it was too 
early to gauge exactly what went wrong at white sands but that the 
problem clearly involved a malfunction in the rocket and not the 
payload 
the star wars program is a research effort to develop lasers 
beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be used to 
automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the united states 
or its allies the pentagon and energy department are spending 4 
billion on such research this year

the us embassy in beijing and the american 
consulate in shanghai the largest city in china soon will begin 
issuing temporary visas to chinese seeking to leave the troubled 
country the state department announced today 
it was not immediately clear whether authorities who have been 
cracking down on dissenters and other prodemocracy forces will 
permit a significant exodus but department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said us diplomats in beijing and in shanghai will do 
what is necessary to process aplications 
troops surround the us embassy in beijing the capital in an 
apparent effort to prevent students and others sought by authorities 
from taking refuge there with dissident fang lizhi and his wife li 
shuxian 
however ms tutwiler said she was not aware of any harassment 
of people standing in line 
the spokeswoman said the embassy and consulate would begin 
issuing limited nonimmigrant visas on wednesday these usually are 
for temporary visits and require either an invitation from the 
united states or a specific event the applicant wishes to attend 
students sought by the police were thought unlikely to apply 
because they would expose themselves to arrest also they would 
need the approval of their schools to get a temporary visas 
until now the us consulate in guangzhou formerly canton has 
been the only us post to issue immigrant visas to chinese 
applicants 
meanwhile ms tutwiler said secretary of state james a baker 
iii held an unannounced meeting monday with chinese ambassador han 
xu at the envoys request she declined to provide any details but 
apparently the meeting dealt with the two dissidents sheltered in 
the us embassy and efforts to arrange their departure from china 
the spokeswoman again criticized the chinese government for 
continuing arrests of critics of the regime she said the arrests 
were very disturbing and called on authorities to respond with 
dialogue instead of repression to the dissidents 
on the offensive monday the state department sharply criticized 
china and paramount leader deng xiaoping even while trying to work 
out a diplomatic solution for the two sheltered dissidents 
the us condemnation challenged chinese disavowals that hundreds 
of students were shot dead by army troops in tiananmen square 
the whole world has seen what happened ms tutwiler said 
large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by army units 
we condemn the use of live fire against unarmed civilians which is 
what happened in tiananmen square 
ms tutwiler said the chinese had strengthened security around 
the us embassy to prevent other dissidents from joining fang and 
li and were jamming voice of america broadcasts 
at the same time she had sharp words for deng who emerged 
friday from more than three weeks of seclusion with praise for the 
armys suppression of prodemocracy forces 
his performance cast doubt on dengs reputation as a cautious but 
ardent advocate of reform of the marxist system ms tutwiler said 
if deng was responsible for the brutal attack on tiananmen square 
then he has acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought 
to foster that is a tragedy for china its people and the legacy he 
sought to pass on

the government flashed pictures of 21 
prodemocracy activists on national television tuesday and said the 
students were wanted for leading a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
every province region city police department railway 
bureau airline and transportation organ is asked to prevent them 
from escaping the television and radio report said 
the government also put border guards on alert to prevent the 
escape of chinas leading dissident fang lizhi and his wife li 
shuxian who were accused of counterrevolutionary propaganda but not 
on the wanted list they were in hiding at the us embassy in 
beijing 
among the students on the wanted list was wuer kaixi who told 
premier li peng in a televised meeting in may that he should stop 
beating around the bush because china faced a political crisis 
the television report also showed footage taken by a hidden 
camera of the charismatic student leader and friends eating at a 
highclass hotel and us tv footage of him addressing rallies 
for democracy and a freer society 
li who played a leading role in crushing the seven weeks of 
protests told a meeting of top officials tuesday the army had won 
only an initial victory when it cleared student demonstrators 
from tiananmen square on june 34 
at present our task is to restore order and strike relentless 
blows at the counterrevolutionary rebels the official xinhua news 
agency quoted li as saying 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources say as many as 
3000 people were killed when the government turned army troops on 
unarmed residents the chinese government has said nearly 300 people 
died mostly soldiers 
streets adjoining tiananmen square were reopened to car and 
bicycle traffic tuesday although no stopping was allowed and 
pedestrians remained barred 
missing from the meeting with li were communist party chief zhao 
ziyang and highlevel party official hu qili moderates who 
reportedly opposed the crackdown and were stripped of their power by 
conservatives led by senior leader deng xiaoping 
li also said china would not yield to foreign pressure to change 
its policy toward the protesters 
we hope that all countries that wish to keep and develop 
friendly relations with china will take a longterm view and avoid 
doing anything to hurt the feelings of the chinese people he said 
many countries including the united states have condemned china 
for ordering its army to fire on the students and supporters 
several countries have recalled their ambassadors in protest but 
none has broken ties 
in washington the bush administration indicated it wont allow 
fang and his wife to be arrested international law forbids chinese 
authorities from entering the embassy compound which is regarded as 
american soil without us permission 
fang an astrophysicist did not play an active role in the 
prodemocracy movement but he has long been an outspoken human 
rights advocate criticizing marxism and chinas top leaders 
even before the army action many top student leaders went into 
hiding the beijing daily newspaper reported tuesday that some 
student leaders had surrendered but it gave no names 
the government wanted list indicated none of the top leaders had 
done so in addition to wuer it included beijing university 
history student wang dan and chai ling one of only two women on the 
list who sent a tape from hiding that was broadcast last week by 
cbs news 
the list accused the 21 students of inciting and organizing 
counterrevolutionary rebellion in beijing and contained details 
about their height hair and other features 
chinese television has more than doubled its usual 30minute news 
program on recent nights to show the arrests of more than 1000 
workers and unemployed youth nationwide for alleged participation in 
antigovernment demonstrations 
the government announced the arrest of a second hong kong 
resident in connection with the protests 
guangdong provincial radio in the southeast said guo wenshen was 
arrested in shaoguan city after posting reactionary slogans on 
poles another hong kong student was arrested at the shanghai 
airport on sunday and accused of leading an illegal student 
organization 
the government regards chinese residents of hong kong as chinese 
citizens even though britain will not return the colony to china 
until 1997 
in the first official indication of possible discontent within 
the army jilin provincial radio reported that soldiers of an 
unidentified army unit had pledged in writing to learn from troops 
supporting the crackdown and to abide by orders 
the radio report monitored by the bbc did not say what prompted 
the written pledges there were small skirmishes last week between 
troops carrying out the crackdown and soldiers opposed to it but 
there was no largescale opposition and by weeks end the army gave

a former federal housing official identified 
as a key figure in investigations of a lowincome housing program 
criticized for mismanagement and favoritism refused today to answer 
questions from a congressional panel 
invoking her rights against selfincrimination deborah gore 
dean onetime executive assistant to former housing secretary samuel 
pierce declined to answer questions about her involvement in the 
process to select which projects would be funded by the department 
of housing and urban developments section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program 
in view of my present inability to obtain access to the hud 
records which would enable me to give accurately testimony that 
would be complete and truthful i respectfully have decided to 
decline to answer any questions posed by the subcommittee at this 
time on the basis of the rights guaranteed to me under the fifth 
amendment to the constitution of the united states 
dean the sole witness to be subpoenaed by the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing is also the only 
one who has refused to testify dean was accompanied by two 
attorneys including former us attorney for the district of 
columbia joseph digenova 
panel chairman tom lantos dcalif told dean he and the 
subcommittee would assist her in obtaining the documents she needed 
but rep bruce morrison dconn questioned whether the extensive 
list of documents requested by her attorneys including all of 
pierces phone logs and appointments between january 1984 and 
december 1988 was reasonable 
earlier another hud official told congressional investigators 
that political influence was involved in the programs selection 
process 
silvio debartolomeis former general deputy assistant secretary 
in the department of housing and urban development and acting 
commissioner of housing said that he left town to avoid signing 
documents approving funding for two projects under huds section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program 
i didnt intend to sign them without the recommendation of 
career employees debartolomeis told the 
but he said he was subsequently ordered to sign the documents by 
dean 
i would have to say that there were political influences 
involved debartolomeis said in describing the program it has 
come under congressional scrutiny since a hud inspector generals 
investigative audit found several appointees of former president 
reagan profited as consultants to many projects that received 
federal funds 
debartolomeis said the people that were politically connected 
were the ones who profited from the program 
i never really was part of that selection process he added 
pierce has testified that he had set up a threeperson selection 
committee composed of debartolomeis dean and a department 
undersecretary 
lantos said in his opening statement that the investigation into 
the program has opened a can of worms at hud 
he said recent revelations that private escrow agents may have 
diverted millions of dollars from sales of hud foreclosure 
properties indicated pierce decided that those hud programs which 
could not be killed by budget slashing could be killed by neglect 
debartolomeis said that one of his concerns about the moderate 
rehabilitation program was that career hud staffers whom he had 
come to respect and depend on were not involved in the 
decisionmaking 
i felt that it could be viewed that these were being done in a 
political manner said debartolomeis 
he said he expressed his concerns to dean whom he viewed as 
the final decisionmaker

house democrats campaigned down to the wire 
tuesday as they sought to complete their top leadership team and 
begin to restore order to a chamber distracted for months by ethics 
charges 
rep richard gephardt who ran unsuccessfully for president last 
year was favored in the race for majority leader while three 
democrats were battling for the post of majority whip in a contest 
clouded by reports of an investigation of one candidates office 
staff 
the democratic caucus the 259member organization of all house 
democrats will vote by secret ballot wednesday to fill the 
secondand thirdranking positions 
the new majority leader will succeed rep thomas s foley 
dwash who was sworn in as speaker of the house last week foley 
replaced jim wright dtexas who was driven out by allegations of 
financial impropriety 
the new whip will take the place of rep tony coelho dcalif 
who is leaving congress thursday over questions about his personal 
finances 
gephardt of missouri is expected to win the no 2 spot though 
he does have opposition from ed jenkins of georgia who ran in an 
effort to give southerners and conservatives a greater voice in a 
generally liberal top echelon 
in the whips race the lineup is tighter rep bill gray of 
pennsylvania is considered to have a slight but shrinking edge over 
david bonior of michigan gray is chairman of the democratic caucus 
while bonior has been coelhos chief deputy also running but far 
behind is beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the partys house 
political campaign arm 
the whip contest has been touched by news reports of an fbi 
investigation into whether there was a nowork ghost employee on 
grays congressional staff the justice department said this week 
that gray himself is not a target of the probe grays attorney 
abbe lowell said the congressman met last week with fbi agents and 
will continue to cooperate 
foley said he did not believe the reports would affect the race 
i think the statement by the justice department was a clear one 
and the race is going to be judged on its own merits he told 
reporters 
the leadership shakeup no matter how it comes out represents 
what rep david obey dwis called the moving of a new 
generation of political power into this place 
the new team will be more telegenic more pragmatic more 
interested in bipartisan consensus 
i think it means more focus on the nittygritty daytoday 
management issues particularly on matters affecting the nations 
economy obey said the team thats shaping up is going to be a 
doggone effective team and people are going to feel good about it 
sometimes in the darkest storms you do have silver linings 
but some democrats fear the new team also may lack in the 
political gutfighting instincts that characterized wright and 
especially coelho 
i felt i was on the starting team and was one of the stars 
coelho said but you remove one of the starters and the team 
adjusts somebodys going to do the political work because it needs 
to be done and theres recognition for it and the caucus is going 
to demand it 
gephardt would bring his campaignhoned media savvy to the 
visible no 2 job as well as some luster from his having sought the 
presidency 
he has told supporters he is putting aside presidential ambitions 
and is instead putting himself into the longterm line to be speaker 
jenkins a popular insider who is a member of the taxwriting 
ways and means committee was still in the race on tuesday but was 
said to be reassessing his bid members were sympathetic to his call 
for greater representation for the partys conservative southern 
wing and there was talk of creation of a special post for someone 
from that group 
after weve seen the caucus elections well have a chance 
to examine whether any appointments might be made that would provide 
some additional balance in the leadership said foley

soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on tuesday challenged west german industrialists to bet on 
his reforms with new investments that could reinforce an era of 
better political relations 
if the federal republic wishes to secure access to soviet 
markets it should begin by offering strategic projects rather than 
trifles gorbachev told several hundred business leaders 
he criticized the wests restrictions on transfer of high 
technology to the soviet union and what he said is the unwillingness 
of many west german businesses to import soviet products 
despite the criticism gorbachev was greeted warmly by members of 
the german eastwest trade committee and received a standing 
ovation as he left 
west germany already is the soviet unions largest western 
trading partner with an annual trade turnover of 75 billion to 
10 billion 
german manufacturers provide machinery for soviet heavy industry 
as well as manufacture of consumer goods and food processing all of 
which gorbachev desperately needs to modify the soviet economy 
the meeting with the business leaders was a key event for 
gorbachev in his fourday visit as he tries to work out ways to meet 
soviets increasingly vocal demands that his reform program improve 
their daily lives 
but he has little room to maneuver premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
said last week the soviet union cannot afford to boost imports of 
consumer goods because of its budget deficit and poor balance of 
payments 
nevertheless gorbachev said the level of sovietwest german 
trade was laughably low and that the assets of sovietwest 
german joint ventures could be increased drastically 
gorbachev pledged the soviet union wouldnt back away from 
economic reform including taming its big bureaucracy but he said 
his reforms need time 
moving too fast to create what he calls a socialist market 
economy and make the ruble convertible would lead to economic 
chaos gorbachev said 
we dont need that and you dont either he told the finance 
and industrial leaders 
the inability to take rubles earned in the soviet union out of 
the country as profits is one of the main problems that discourages 
western businesses 
he defended the quality of soviet research and proposed that 
soviet scientists carry out projects for west germany in return for 
technology 
he proposed that german businesses help the soviet union convert 
defense industries to peaceful uses cooperate in building ships and 
planes and noted that talks are under way on developing economic 
zones in the soviet union 
otto wolff von amerongen chairman of the trade group told 
gorbachev that joint ventures with the soviet union have limited 
appeal for west german business 
we should not overestimate them as a business instrument 
amerongen said in your country they are occasionally thought to 
be a wonder weapon of foreign business reform 
he added that the soviet union could not permanently end its 
economic slump without improving the quantity and quality of the 
finished goods it exports soviet exports now are dominated by raw 
materials such as oil natural gas and timber 
gorbachev said he was deeply satisfied with his two days of 
talks with chancellor helmut kohl and other top political leaders 
both sides have said the talks are putting an end to a tradition 
of hostility and suspicion and opening up broad possbilities for 
future cooperation that is essential to gorbachevs vision for a 
common european home from the atlantic ocean to the soviet 
unions ural mountains 
he stressed to the business leaders that they have a key role to 
play in further lessening those tensions 
i cant imagine a common european home without firm economic 
ground beneath it gorbachev said in order to establish that 
security europe needs a long period of peaceful development he 
said

a rescue helicopter searching a remote valley 
early today spotted the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that 
vanished sunday with 11 people aboard authorities said there were 
no signs of survivors 
pieces of the twinengine beechcraft were strewn over the face of 
a cliff on hawaii islands northeast coast three miles from where 
aircraft had pinpointed an emergency radio signal on monday 
authorities said 
marines lowered themselves by ropes in an attempt to reach the 
crash site said coast guard spokesman david santos 
debris is spread out over a 200 to 300meter area said 
marine spokesman maj kerry gershaneck theres nothing that our 
people see that would identify the wreckage as an aircraft there is 
no sign of survivors 
the scenic air tours plane disappeared without indication of 
trouble sunday during what was supposed to be an hourlong flight 
from hawaii island to maui island the plane had left under partly 
sunny skies carrying a pilot and 10 tourists 
heavy rain and strong winds on monday prevented helicopters from 
searching the valley a coast guard helicopter had picked up the 
emergency signal from the waimanu valley region on the northeast 
side of hawaii island 
the valley is about four miles long with several major side 
valleys and has a 320foothigh waterfall it cuts deep into the 
5480foot kohala mountain and is thick with vegetation 
the planes last reported position was 10 miles north of hilo and 
flying at 2000 feet according to federal aviation administration 
spokesman george harvey the plane passed out of radar contact at 
that point and would not have reemerged on radar until it passed 
the islands northern tip 
the names of those aboard eight americans and two australians 
will not be released until all their families have been notified 
said david tom the tour companys operations manager 
the planes 28yearold pilot had about 4000 hours flying 
experience and had flown the aroundtheisland tour about 50 times 
according to scenic air tours chief pilot doug rogers 
in 1987 a twinengine panorama air tours plane with eight people 
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from honolulu to 
molokai island

despite its unilateral cuts the soviet militarys 
overwhelming numbers still make it the worlds biggest war 
machine and dont back up kremlin claims about a switch to defensive 
strategy the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff said 
tuesday 
speaking candidly it is rather difficult for americans and 
those in many other countries to see how such a massive array of 
power is mandated by the legitimate needs of defense adm william 
j crowe jr told students and instructors at the voroshilov general 
staff military academy in moscow 
crowe on an 11day official visit to the soviet union also 
suggested that instead of announcing more unilateral reductions the 
kremlin join the united states in negotiating mutual cuts even of 
modest scale a step he said would best promote progress in arms 
control 
youd be surprised at the effect it would have and pave the 
way for more dramatic steps in the future crowe told his soviet 
audience 
the 64yearold admiral accompanied by an entourage of top us 
brass and gen mikhail a moiseyev his official host and head of 
the soviet general staff also visited once secret military 
installations outside moscow to examine weaponry 
it was the latest in a series of highlevel military visits 
designed to dispel mistrust between the superpowers the visits 
began in july with one to the united states by marshal sergei f 
akhromeyev then soviet chief of staff in august thendefense 
secretary frank carlucci visited the soviet union 
in a heavy rain crowe and top us military officers who 
accompanied him were shown a training version of a snubnosed ss19 
missile in its silo at the balabanovo base where officer cadets are 
taught how to launch the icbm the pentagon says can carry six 
nuclear warheads up to 6200 miles 
at the kubinka air garrison soviet warplanes painted in 
camouflage including the mig29 fighter and su24 attack aircraft 
were parked on the tarmac for the admiral and his entourage to 
inspect 
like carlucci crowe also clambered up a metal ladder to board 
the soviet unions newest longrange strategic bomber the 
needlenosed tu160 better known in the west by its nato 
designation of blackjack 
after viewing the aircraft crowe said he was very impressed 
were talking worldclass aviation here he said 
gen monroe hatch deputy chief of the us air force said all 
10 soviet warplanes and helicopters on display already had been seen 
by westerners some at international air shows or during carluccis 
visit last year but to say many people have seen the blackjack is 
an overstatement hatch said 
in a dec 7 speech to the united nations president mikhail s 
gorbachev announced the soviets unilaterally would cut their armed 
forces by 500000 men to 37 million last month during a session 
of the congress of peoples deputies he also pledged defense 
spending would be cut by the equivalent of 153 billion by the end 
of 1991 
soviet officials say the reductions are in line with the new 
military doctrine announced by the sovietled warsaw pact in may 
1987 of reasonable sufficiency which stipulates that a country 
needs enough military might to repel an assailant and no more 
crowe in his speech at the academy on relations between the us 
and soviet militaries welcomed gorbachevs un declaration as an 
important step but played down its overall significance 
as we see it these drawdowns will affect only the margins of 
soviet military power crowe said even after the anticipated 
reductions you will still possess the worlds largest active 
military establishment as well as a larger inventory of military 
hardware than all of nato combined in many categories of equipment 
in a questionandanswer period a soviet army lieutenant general 
who identified himself only as krebyshev asked crowe if the 
americans intended to reduce their military forces to a defensive 
level as we are trying now to do 
crowe reacted with skepticism to the officers assessment of his 
own countrys military posture i base my judgment on whether 
policy is offensive or defensive on the total strength and weight of 
forces that can be brought to bear he said when im facing 
overwhelming numbers i cant conclude anything else but that its 
offensively oriented 
moiseyev seated in front of the lecture hall objected to 
crowes assessment he listed weaponry the soviet union has 
announced it will withdraw from service including 10000 tanks 
8500 artillery pieces and 850 warplanes 
this is not a propaganda campaign moiseyev said

over opposition of the bush administration a 
house ways and means subcommittee voted tuesday to extend expiring 
tax credits that benefit employers who hire the poor and investors 
who put money into lowincome housing 
also without dissent the revenue subcommittee agreed to a 
significant simplification of the corporate minimum tax and voted to 
expand a credit for rehabilitating historic and other older 
buildings 
the four bills now go to the full ways and means committee rep 
charles rangel dny chairman of the subcommittee said major 
changes in the bill affecting corporate minimum tax are likely 
the four house bills would 
extend through 1992 the targetedjobs tax credit under which 
the government in effect pays up to 2400 of the first years wages 
of newly hired workers from any of nine targeted poor groups those 
groups include youths aged 18 through 22 vietnamera veterans and 
welfare recipients 
the credit is due to expire at yearend the administration 
contends that in many cases the credit is only a windfall to an 
employer who would have hired the worker without any special 
incentive 
renewal would cost 647 million over the next five years 
modify and extend through 1992 the lowincome housing credit 
which encourages investors to put mney into building and 
rehabilitating rental homes for lowincome people this would cost 
more than 32 billion over the next five years 
the subcommittee agreed to permit states which administer the 
credit to carry over for one year any credit authority that was not 
used in the previous year another change would permit claiming the 
credit in 15year installments current law has a 10year limit 
the administration questions whether the credit makes more 
housing available to families who are substantially under the 
poverty level 
make the tax credit for rehabilitating old buildings more 
attractive to upperincome investors by watering down a restriction 
enacted in 1986 in an effort to reduce abusive tax shelters the 
change would cost 145 million over five years 
the credit is 10 percent of the cost of rehabilitating any 
nonresidential building constructed before 1936 and 20 percent for 
certified historical structures 
the change would allow an investor at any income level to use a 
limited amount of passive losses from rental activities to offset 
nonrental income and still claim the rehabilitation credit present 
law denies that benefit to an investor with total income over 
250000 
the subcommittee approved a similar change in the lowincome 
housing credit 
simplify the corporate minimum tax by eliminating a set of 
calculations concerning adjusted current earnings the 
simplification would cost about 100 million over five years this 
change overrides a provision that was enacted in 1986 but due to go 
into effect in 1990 
subcommittee members said they will seek to amend the measure to 
benefit specific industries including oil and gas and state and 
local bonds

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and west german chancellor helmut kohl endorsed a joint strategy 
tuesday to heal the wounds of european division which their 
nations helped inflict half a century ago 
they assured the world their partnership poses no threat this 
time as it did when adolf hitler and josef stalin divided poland in 
their 1939 nonaggression pact 
both nations want a common european home in which the united 
states and canada have their place and all nations exist in 
peaceful competition with one another the joint declaration 
says 
a tidal wave of goodwill toward gorbachev on the second day of 
his state visit appeared to wash away fears rooted in the collusion 
of the dictators and the destruction of world war ii 
at least 3000 people many waving soviet flags and handpainted 
banners with greetings in russian welcomed gorbachev and his wife 
raisa in sunny cobblestoned market square 
chants of gorby gorby arose when he ventured into the crowd 
to shake hands as he so often does on visits abroad 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the 
crowd made a strong emotional impression on gorbachev and he 
said he felt as if he were on red square among his own people 
on the steps of city hall mrs gorbachev beckoned a 
flowerwaving child her husband held up heinrichsebastian 
schilling 4 in front of photographers and a cheering crowd 
at a state banquet at augustusburg castle gorbachev declared 
our cooperation can serve as a catalyst for new relations between 
the whole of east and west 
also on tuesday he used a speech at the cologne stock exchange 
to outline economic reforms intended to encourage joint ventures 
with west german businesses he appealed for integration of the 
economies to make relations more quakeresistant 
gorbachevs fourday visit which began monday has been marked 
by a clear desire on both sides for a new start in sovietgerman 
relations and the cooperative pursuit of european unity by historic 
adversaries 
hans klein a west german government spokesman described the 
joint declaration signed by gorbachev and kohl as a turning point in 
relations 
the document states common objectives for improving security and 
ensuring peace which both sides see as a second stage in the 
ostpolitik detente begun in 1970 it reiterates the stated aim 
of nato and the warsaw pact to work toward a 50 percent reduction in 
strategic nuclear arms and ban on chemical weapons 
support is expressed for the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
between the united states and the soviet union which the soviets 
and west germans see as prohibiting development of the spacebased 
defense system advocated by former president ronald reagan 
no reference is made to ways of reducing shortrange nuclear 
weapons a major point of contention in arms control talks between 
the two military alliances 
the first joint eastwest approach to overcoming divisions in 
europe stresses that other nations should not fear renewed 
cooperation between the soviet union and west germany 
west germany and the soviet union have embarked on a new course 
assuring that better sovietwest german cooperation is not directed 
against anyone the declaration says 
among the common objectives are the right of all peoples and 
states to freely determine their fate and the need to heal the 
wounds of the past it says 
asked whether the agreement could help resolve territorial 
questions stemming from the hitlerstalin pact which allowed the 
soviet union to annex the independent baltic states of latvia 
estonia and lithuania gorbachev said i dont think we need to 
turn to such a distant chapter of history 
he said the joint agreements purpose was to formalize the desire 
of moscow and bonn for a new stage in our relations 
gerasimov said at a briefing with klein that gorbachev viewed the 
joint declaration as the reward of a long path of searching over 
many years 
ministers of the two governments made 11 agreements official 
during the signing ceremony at kohls office but an accord on 
access for soviet shipping to west german canals could not be 
completed in time 
some of the other agreements establish a bonnmoscow hot line 
and deal with protection of capital investments training of soviet 
managers in west germany and cultural and student exchanges

a yacht built for adolf hitler and sunk 
with great fanfare to commemorate the voyage of the damned was 
mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping 
lane officials said tuesday 
theyre going to have to move it said coast guard 
spokeswoman veronica cady 
the 85foot ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial 
reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast 
it was sunk june 4 50 years after the us coast guard turned 
away the ss st louis as its more than 900 jewish passengers were 
seeking refuge from the holocaust 
the sinking site was supposed to be near where the coast guard 
intercepted the st louis whose passengers also were turned away by 
cuba and forced to return to europe most of the passengers later 
died in nazi concentration camps 
for unexplained reasons the ostwind was pushed off a barge about 
a mile north of the site and is resting in 25 feet of water on a 
living reef 
it was truly an incredible incredible historic event and 
suddenly boom somebody made a mistake said mayor abe 
resnick a holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event 
federal and dade county officials who allowed resnick to sink the 
boat are upset about the result 
they didnt even come close complained susan markely an 
administrator with dades environmental department 
coast guard lt al crespo said the yacht is balanced on a 
delicate living reef threatening damage to coral and sponges its 
also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels 
heading to the port of miami and has been marked with a flashing 
buoy he said 
its close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor it could 
hit it crespo said 
the army corps of engineers said the ostwind must be moved or cut 
to pieces by june 22 if its not the government will remove it and 
bill resnick 
resnick blames the mistake on am daly jr captain of the tug 
that towed the yacht to where it was sunk 
daly however said chris cadley captain of a passenger boat 
that accompanied him had agreed to lead him to the site 
cadley denied that saying he only agreed to meet daly off the 
coast 
resnick said someone will have to pay 
i thinks thats going to end up being decided by attorneys 
said ben mostkoff the countys artificial reef director 
the ostwind was built at hitlers direction although he rarely 
used it after world war ii the badly decayed boat wound up in the 
hands of a jacksonville marina owner

a gunman branded by the mayor as the 
archtypical vigilante is being sought by authorities for 
allegedly shooting at six young people in a subway station in 
revenge for them robbing him a day earlier 
the gunman confronted the six youths saturday and asked 
remember me before opening fire with a 9mm gun police said 
the gunman described as about 17 then fled the station and 
disappeared police said 
robbery charges against three of the youths caught in the gunfire 
were temporarily dropped monday by the brooklyn district attorneys 
office while detectives searched for the victimturnedgunman 
we need the victim to corroborate the robbery said spokesman 
louis haber 
roy innis national chairman of the congress of racial equality 
likened the gunman to bernhard goetz the subway gunman who 
wounded four teenagers on a subway train in 1985 because he said 
they had threatened him innnis appealed to the gunman to surrender 
and offered him free legal counsel 
your assailants should not be allowed to walk arrogantly free 
while you are forced to hide innis said in a statement 
but mayor edward i koch dismissed any comparison between the 
gunman and goetz 
a jury found that bernie goetz was in danger in his mind 
reasonable under the circumstances for him to take an action to 
defend himself he said 
in this case this guy was not in any danger he had been held 
up on a prior occasion recognized the people apparently who 
allegedly held him up and went over to inflict personal 
punishment 
thats archtypical vigilantism unacceptable koch declared 
detectives canvassed the area of fridays robbery and saturday 
assaults in an effort to find witnesses 
brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzmans office decided 
monday to defer prosecution against david godbole 24 dantay smith 
16 and a 14yearold youth whose name was withheld because of his 
age until the victim of the robbery is found 
godbole and smith were wounded in the thigh and the teenager was 
wounded in the buttocks 
they were arrested based on statements from the other three 
youths who were present both nights said transit police spokesman 
al oleary 
they were charged with firstdegree robbery and possession of a 
weapon a hammer which was allegedly used friday by the group that 
surrounded the man believed to be the gunman and stole his gold 
chain and gold bracelet 
the gunman faces charges of attempted murder and criminal use of 
a deadly weapon police said

the nations beleaguered savings institutions 
lost 34 billion in the first three months of this year in sharp 
contrast with commercial banks which enjoyed record profits of 73 
billion the government reported tuesday 
as in the past texas sampls suffering from a depressed regional 
economy contributed the bulk of the savings industrys losses 
texas thrifts lost 22 billion although that was a 38 percent 
improvement over the same period in 1988 
seventythree percent of sampls nationally earned a profit 13 
billion but that was swamped by 47 billion in losses at the 27 
percent that lost money 
the federal home loan bank board reported that losses by the 
2938 sampls worsened from the revised 32 billion in the final three 
months of 1988 
meanwhile profits at the 13001 commercial banks hit a record 
level for the third straight quarter up from 67 billion in the 
final three months of last year 
the bank board revised its previously reported sampl loss total for 
all of last year adding 900 million to bring 1988 red ink to a 
postdepression record of 13 billion 
the thrift industry will be plagued by continuing losses 
predicted economist paul getman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa consulting firm not only are property values in some areas 
still falling but thrifts have been squeezed because their cost 
of funds have been rising faster than their mortgage rates 
james r barth chief economist of the bank board said heavy sampl 
losses would continue until congress enacts president bushs bailout 
bill 
no legislation no new funds is not the best way to deal with 
open but insolvent institutions he said 
barth said the more than 200 institutions rescued last year with 
government assistance contributed 145 million in profits but he 
said about 10 of those institutions were losing money 
reporting on commercial banks the federal deposit insurance 
corp said profits rose in 42 states and the district of columbia 
and declined in eight states and puerto rico new england in 
particular looked weaker with profits slipping in massachusetts 
connecticut and maine 
alex sheshunoff a financial industry analyst based in austin 
texas said he was concerned that banks have increased their real 
estate lending by 129 percent over a year ago while boosting 
commercial lending by only 14 percent 
real estate lending has been the achilles heel of the banking 
industry were beginning to see that deteriorate in the 
northeast he said 
only one state texas reported a loss for its banks but its 13 
million in red ink was minuscule compared with a 17 billion net 
loss in the comparable 1988 quarter other oilproducing states 
alaska oklahoma and louisiana also showed big improvements 
john quinn an fdic analyst attributed commercial bankings 
strong performance to a decline in bad loans particularly in states 
west of the mississippi river an increase in loan income caused by 
rising interest rates and success in controlling overhead expenses 
unlike sampls banks offer mostly shortterm loans and can more 
quickly raise the interest rate they charge while at the same time 
holding down rates paid to depositors compared with sampls banks are 
hurt less and sometimes helped by rising interest rates 
quinn said bad loans have declined particularly in farming states 
and noted that institutions there so far have not suffered because 
of last years drought 
despite the profits banks continued to fail at a high rate the 
fdic which insures deposits said 93 banks have failed or required 
government assistance so far this year compared with 89 during the 
same period in 1988 for all of last year a postdepression record 
of 221 failed 
however the number of problem banks has slipped to 1289 
the lowest level in three years down from 1491 a year ago 
despite the failures last year banks posted a record profit of 
251 billion that followed a postdepression low in 1987 of 28 
billion which was caused by large writeoffs of third world debt 
getman said argentinas problems in making payments on its 60 
billion in debt will likely begin hurting bank performance in the 
second and third quarters 
obviously bank profits are very good but theyre not likely to 
stay that good this year he said

presidentelect carlos menem 
changed his mind and said tuesday he will take office june 30 the 
date raul alfonsin intends to resign because of the worst economic 
crisis in argentine history 
we are willing totally willing to assume the direction of the 
argentine republic on that date menem told reporters in la rioja 
province of which he is governor 
on monday night alfonsin said in a nationally broadcast speech 
he lacked the political support to manage the crisis and said he 
would leave office at the end of the month 
from la rioja 700 miles northwest of buenos aires menem 
expressed surprise at the statement and said he could not assume the 
presidency on such short notice 
menems change of heart tuesday appeared to resolve an impasse 
that began when his peronist party defeated alfonsins radical civic 
union in national elections may 14 seven months before the dec 10 
inauguration date stipulated in the constitution 
the constitution requires four months between election and 
inauguration of a president so a formal electoral college vote can 
be taken but alfonsin called the elections early because of the 
economic crisis the charter limits a president to one sixyear term 
for half a day after alfonsins speech it appeared menems 
brother eduardo president of the senate would be interim chief 
executive 
at a news conference tuesday surrounded by his cabinet 
designees carlos menem said we are prepared to assume this 
responsability on the date the president has decided that is to 
say on june 30 we will begin to govern argentina 
the peronists and radical civic union tried for weeks to reach an 
accord on an early transition against a backdrop of inflation that 
nearly doubled prices every month a growing budget deficit a 
nearly worthless currency record interest rates and rising 
unemployment 
at least 14 people were killed and dozens seriously injured in 
food riots and looting that began the last week of may 
some in alfonsins party said the main obstacle was menems 
insistence that alfonsin end the divisive trials of about 18 
officers accused of violating human rights in the dirty war 
against leftists by the military governments of 197683 
alfonsin refused to intervene in those cases or to grant amnesty 
to officers already tried convicted and sentenced to prison 
army officers demanding the trials be stopped led three 
rebellions between april 1987 and december 1988 
in a draft agreement alfonsin signed and sent to menem on monday 
he said radicals in congress would support menems economic and 
social legislation 
menem said tuesday he needs those votes and asked for an 
explicit commitment before the argentine people that the package of 
laws that will be sent to the national congress are going to be 
respected approved and sanctioned 
he did not mention the military question

hungarys ruling communist party and 
leaders of the opposition began negotiations tuesday on multiparty 
elections that could lead to the nations first coalition government 
in more than 40 years 
parliament speaker matyas szueros who presided over the 
45minute meeting in parliaments ornate hunter hall said the 
unprecedented meeting marked the end of an era and the opening of 
a new one 
hungarians are anxious and hopeful szueros told the 
delegates the people expect to draw encouragement from your 
talks 
the party seven groups largely associated with it and nine 
opposition groups are negotiating to determine the rules for the 
first multiparty parliamentary elections since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 
the elections are due by the middle of next year but there have 
been increasing calls for them to be held sooner 
szueros said the negotiating parties will meet again on june 21 
to agree on the main themes they will address 
party chief karoly grosz told the participants he hoped for a 
viable governing coalition after the elections and in view of this 
we need to emphasize the things that unite us 
let us work together for a new hungary grosz said 
he said all of the participants want to accelerate the transition 
to a more democractic government 
speaking on behalf of the opposition imre konya said we do 
not want to share in power we want the citizens to decide whom they 
want to entrust with leading hungary 
everyone must renounce the use of force even if the elections 
do not turn out to their liking added konya a lawyer 
istvan kukorelli of the patriotic peoples front spoke on behalf 
of the groups largely associated with the communist party and said 
they were tolerant of different views 
the groups including the partys youth league and official trade 
unions do not consider themselves a unified body he said and do 
not wish to operate under the tutelage of any party 
the three factions formally agreed to the election negotiations 
on saturday 
opposition groups established in the past year and a half have 
been pressing for a say in drafting legislation and a new 
constitution for free elections and the transition to a more 
democratic government 
the party approached the opposition groups about the issues in 
march those groups said they would participate in any negotiations 
as a united front 
on june 4 poland held multiparty elections the most democratic 
in the soviet bloc in four decades and opposition candidates 
backed by solidarity won nearly every seat open to them

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade widened sharply in the first three months of the year as an 
improvement in the sale of american merchandise was swamped by a 
deterioration in the countrys investment balance sheet the 
government reported tuesday 
the commerce department said the deficit in the current account 
which had fallen for two consecutive quarters jumped 7 percent 
analysts viewed the setback as disturbing evidence of how severe 
americas trading problems are 
meanwhile the government also reported tuesday that retail 
sales held back by weak auto and department store sales rose a 
slim 01 percent in may 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but also transactions in services primarily 
investment flows between countries 
for the first three months of the year the merchandise portion 
of the deficit showed a marked improvement narrowing by 137 
percent to 2763 billion the smallest deficit for merchandise 
trade in four years 
that improvement was offset however by a steep drop in the 
services category which fell to a tiny surplus of 369 million from 
a surplus of 836 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988 
most of the first quarter decline was blamed on the rising value 
of the dollar which lowers the profits of us companies operating 
overseas because their foreign earnings buy less when they are 
changed back into dollars 
beyond the currency movements analysts said the trade report was 
disturbing because it reflected the fact that america once the 
worlds largest creditor nation is now its largest debtor 
simply put that means foreigners now own more in investments in 
the united states than americans hold in overseas investments the 
total excess of foreign holdings is estimated to have risen above 
500 billion last year although the governments official accounting 
of the us net debtor status will not be released until june 29 
many economists believe americas standard of living will 
deteriorate in coming years as the country is forced to transfer 
more and more of its wealth into foreign hands to service its 
foreign debt 
the current account reflects how much we have to continue to 
borrow said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co here 
we are doing so much better on our merchandise exports but we are 
still hurting because of our increasing debtor status 
cynthia latta senior economist at data resources inc said she 
believed a decline in living standards could already be seen in the 
weak growth over the last few years in personal incomes after 
adjusting for inflation 
we are already starting to feel the effects of the consumption 
binge the country has been on she said at some point we have 
to slow our consumption by saving more and thus lessening the need 
to import foreign capital 
the current account provides a measure of the amount of money 
this country must raise abroad to finance its economy 
at the start of this decade the united states was running 
surpluses in its current account because earnings from american 
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in 
merchandise trade 
but as americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign 
hands to pay for imported cars and televisions the investment 
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985 when 
america became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
the changed status has stired a political debate over whether 
growing foreign ownership of american companies real estate and 
treasury bonds means that the united states is transfering control 
of its economic destiny to foreigners 
tuesdays report said that in addition to the 2763 billion 
deficit in merchandise trade and the slight 369 million surplus in 
the services category the 3069 billion current account deficit 
reflected payments of 342 billion in foreign aid and pensions to 
americans living overseas 
the government is due to release on thursday its estimate of the 
merchandise trade deficit for april in advance of that report many 
analysts were looking for little change from the march monthly 
deficit figure of 886 billion 
in the report on retail sales the commerce department said the 
tiny 01 percent increase put may sales at a seasonally adjusted 
1411 billion 
analysts said they expected this sluggishness to continue as 
consumers saw their purchasing power constrained by higher energy 
and food costs

allowing steel import barriers to lapse this 
year would leave us firms little alternative but to file costly 
unfair trading cases against some steelexporting nations 
proponents of the restraints told a house panel tuesday 
a hearing by the house ways and means trade subcommittee pitted 
advocates of the import curbs against the policys opponents who 
argued that the steel industry has had too much special protection 
the reagan administration negotiated fiveyear 
productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements in 1984 with 
japan south korea the european community brazil and other nations 
to limit the flow of foreign steel into the united states 
the agreements expire sept 30 and president bush has pledged to 
continue the curbs in some form 
but with the domestic steel industry newly profitable opponents 
of the program believe they can make a case for ending the barriers 
or at least narrowing their scope 
house backers of the curbs said wednesday they have 240 
cosponsors for a bill implementing the program they are hoping 
that bush will soon begin negotiating new steel import pacts with 
the 29 nations covered by the old agreements 
but not all the house members at the hearing agreed that the 
pacts should be renewed 
republican leader robert michel of illinois called for a gradual 
phaseout of the import program and rep sam gibbons dfla said 
steelworkers salaries have been above the average manufacturing 
wage since world war ii 
why should we treat the steel industry any differently from all 
the other industries said gibbons the trade subcommittee 
chairman 
but united steelworkers president lynn williams told the panel 
that the alternative to negotiated agreements would be unfair 
trading cases filed by us firms 
most of our trading partners have entered into these 
negotiations primarily because absent negotiated settlements other 
trade restraint options could have been applied against them since 
they were vulnerable to being declared as unfair traders williams 
said in a prepared statement 
in other words it is not unlike an outofcourt settlement 
where the evidence of violation at least in the steel import 
situation was so overwhelming that the offending party preferred 
settlement to adjudication he said 
frank luerssen chairman of the american iron and steel 
institute an industry group agreed that the alternative to 
restraint agreements would be massive and very costly trade 
litigation 
but gibbons said the negotiated settlements have done little to 
discourage foreign governments from subsidizing their steel 
industries making it tough for us firms to compete 
i want to use the laws on the books to whack them in the head 
whack them in the knees and wherever else they need it he said

a soviet pilot said tuesday he battled to keep his 
mig29 from crashing into a crowd at the paris air show last week 
after a bird or other foreign object got caught in the fighter jets 
engine 
anatoly kvochur who saved himself by ejecting from the aircraft 
about 500 feet before it crashed thursday said he took about three 
seconds to decide where to aim his falling jet 
the 37yearold pilot who suffered only minor injuries spoke at 
a news conference inside a huge antonov225 transport plane 
about 2 minutes and 50 seconds after takeoff kvochur said he 
pushed the throttle to increase thrust and at that moment the right 
engine stalled he said the mig29 is equipped with a special system 
to deal with such a situation and he believed the engine would 
recover 
i was greatly concerned that the aircraft did not turn to the 
crowd of people buildings and aircraft said kvochur who has 12 
years of flying experience 
the aircraft began pulling toward the crowd along the airstrip 
he said and he expected the engine to recover 
i expected to save the aircraft he said 
he said he then realized the engines would not recover and a 
crash was inevitable and steered the aircraft to an open space on 
the airfield 
you see he said speaking in russian through an interpreter 
i had time to spare to think of the situation but very few 
seconds to do it 
it was a hard decision to eject it is hard to leave an 
aircraft thats still flying 
kvochur thanked the french emergency personnel and doctors who 
treated me with special care 
he also thanked claude martin director of flight operations for 
the 10day air show for making him fly higher than the usual 450 
feet at which he flies the same routine in the soviet union 
kvochur said he suffered only minor bruises to his back and 
stomach and a slight cut on his eyebrow when his oxygen mask struck 
his face when he hit the ground 
i feel quite good and if my bosses will allow me id like 
to fly the mig29 from paris to moscow and if they really trust me 
id like to fly another mig29 during the show he said with a 
grin 
martin who also attended the news conference said the pilot 
performed exactly the way im supposed to see everyone perform 
he was on the dot he made no mistakes martin said 
rostislav a belyakov general designer for the mikoyan design 
studio that crafted the mig29 complimented kvochurs performance 
calling him the most famous pilot of the day 
balyakov defended the reliability of the mig29 which he said the 
soviet union intends to market aggressively to clients in the 
future we have the production facilities to sell the aircraft for 
export and we expect to do it he said adding that it would be 
marketed at a price comparable to us fighters 
although an official report has not yet been issued kvochur said 
he believed a foreign object possibly a bird or a small stone from 
the airstrip was sucked into the right engine as it prepared for 
takeoff 
the two flight recorders were sent to moscow right after the 
crash and belyakov said they corroborate kvochurs analysis of the 
incident 
belyakov added that videotapes showed a bird near the aircraft 
there is nothing that can be done to stop a bird flying into 
the engine and if there was one bird there could have been two 
or a whole squadron he said

syrian and christian soldiers exchanged 
fire for five hours tuesday in an artillery war that has killed 
hundreds of people in the past three months most of them civilians 
an arab league envoy met with christian leaders about ways of 
stopping the battle the league proclaimed a ceasefire in april 
but it has been violated regularly 
police said nine people were wounded tuesday by shelling with 
howitzers tank cannons and recoilless rifles along the southeastern 
flank of the 310squaremile enclave east of beirut where 1 million 
christians live 
at least 367 people have been slain and 1441 wounded since the 
fighting began march 8 between christian army units led by gen 
michel aoun and a moslem alliance of syrian soldiers and druse 
militiamen 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 the year after lebanons 
sectarian civil war began aoun has declared a war of liberation 
against what he describes as syrian occupation 
a spokesman for aouns command accused syrian gunners of 
provoking mondays duel by shelling christian positions around souk 
elgharb a mountain resort southeast of beirut 
souk elgharb commands roads that connect the christian enclave 
and mountains controlled by the syrians and druse 
the spokesman for aoun who would not let his name be used said 
syrian gunners also shelled kfarshima and hadath christian suburbs 
of beirut 
christian gunners responded in kind to the enemy fire 
according to the spokesman he said the shells came from aitat a 
syriancontrolled druse village south of souk elgharb and from 
choueifat a druse suburb of beirut 
the syrian shelling targeted several residential areas the 
spokesman said the four civilians were wounded in hadath 
he accused the yrians of starting the fight to foil efforts by 
arab leaders to work out a solid ceasefire 
lakhdar ibrahimi assistant secretarygeneral of the arab league 
met with christian leaders in the enclave during the artillery 
exchange 
it began as he drove across the line from moslem west beirut to 
the christian eastern sector for separate meetings with aoun 
maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir former president 
charles helou and george saadeh leader of the rightwing christian 
phalange party 
ibrahimi met aoun at the generals combination bunker and office 
beneath the heavily damaged presidential palace in baabda east of 
beirut 
after conferring with the maronite general ibrahimi told 
reporters a threemember arab summit committee was determined to 
achieve its mandate on lebanon the contacts im holding are within 
this framework 
the committee king fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of 
morocco and chadli bendjedid president of algeria was appointed 
by the arab league summit in casablanca last month to find a 
settlement of the lebanese civil war 
last weekend ibrahimi was in damascus for talks with president 
hafez assad of syria who has become lebanons main power broker 
and foreign minister farouk sharaa 
the latest round in the civil war began two days after aouns men 
blockaded illegal ports run by moslem militias which deprive the 
government of an estimated 100 million a year in customs revenues 
druse militiamen led by walid jumblatt began the shooting the 
syrians soon joined them and moslem forces sealed off the christian 
enclave

two 20minute videos one for elementary school students and the 
other for teenagers were screened monday night for city officials 
religious leaders community organizers and some students 
many in the audience gasped at the stark depictions of racism and 
discrimination some of which were drawn from reallife cases 
according to police 
they will be shown to students in boston public and parochial 
schools in all grades including kindergarten this fall 
the videos included reenactments of an incident involving a 
white man beating a vietnamese youth on the street and two black 
teenagers punching a white youth as he stood at a bus stop 
the video designed for younger children included a sketch 
involving professional actors and a group of kids who ostracized all 
8yearolds by chanting down with eights 
among those authorities especially hope to inform are innercity 
children and newly arrived immigrants who learn about the american 
system through their children 
for the first time we will have a program that will teach the 
adults of the future that they have the right to dignity without 
being harassed intimidated or insulted said boston police 
commissioner francis m roache theres a law backing you up 
massachusetts is one of 14 states that has a civil rights 
statute according to police it was enacted in 1979 and is one of 
the toughest civil rights laws in the country carrying with it a 
mandatory 10year sentence for those convicted of criminal violation 
of a persons civil rights 
the 11yearold community disorders unit the first police unit 
in the country formed to investigate racially motivated crimes 
commissioned the videos they were produced in conjunction with the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith and wcvbtv in boston 
no one in 1989 should be made to suffer in silence said 
leonard zakim of the antidefamation league were doing more 
than saying its a terrible thing were doing something about it 
boston police say that members of the philadelphia police 
department have already visited the city to learn about the videos 
and civil rights education here they said they hoped the message 
contained in the videos will spread around the country and inspire 
civil rights education in other cities

rep julian dixon chairman of the house ethics 
committee said tuesday there was no connection between the panels 
hiring of the president of the los angeles airport commission in 
1986 and a lucrative investment by dixons wife in shops at the 
airport 
dixon said johnnie l cochran a los angeles attorney was paid 
170000 in 1986 and 1987 for legal work for the ethics committee 
i did hire cochran to do work on the st germain case dixon 
dcalif said in a telephone interview 
the ethics committee looked into the personal finances of rep 
fernand st germain dri and concluded in 1987 that any 
improprieties did not warrant further investigation st germain was 
defeated in his 1988 reelection bid 
two months after the house committee retained cochran on feb 5 
1986 the los angeles board of airport commissioners awarded a 
concession to run seven dutyfree stores at the airport to a joint 
venture headed by duty free shoppers inc of san francisco 
at that time april 1986 cochran was president of the airport 
board he is no longer president but remains on the fivemember 
board 
other companies in the joint venture were mir kanon inc a 
minority enterprise and peideau inc a femalerun business city 
policies required that minority and femalerun businesses be part of 
any concession handed out by the airport 
in july 1986 dixons wife betty bought a 12 percent interest 
in mir kanon and peideau this investment earned her over 150000 
in 1987 and 1988 according to dixons financial disclosure forms 
for those years 
there was no connection i want to make this as strong as i 
can no connection between the hiring of cochran and mrs 
dixons business dixon said i have never discussed with 
johnnie cochran anything about betty dixons business 
cochran said he didnt know mrs dixon was part of the duty free 
concession until about a year ago 
at no time did julian and i ever talk about it until recent 
weeks said cochran 
cochran said he voted to give duty free shoppers the concession 
on april 30 1986 but he was not part of the committee that 
recommended the firm 
dixon recently gained national exposure when he presided over the 
ethics committees investigation of house speaker jim wright who 
resigned after the panel charged him with 69 violations of house 
rules among other things the committee said wrights wife betty 
accepted improper gifts from a wealthy texas businessman 
allegations wright denied 
rep thomas s foley dwash who succeeded wright as the house 
speaker said he knew of nothing amiss about mrs dixons business 
or her husbands decision to amend his 1986 financial disclosure 
form 
as far as i know there is no impropriety of any kind and the 
refiling is in accordance with the rules he said 
dixon said cochran an outstanding lawyer was hired by the 
ethics panel based on his qualifications and the qualifications of 
his law firm 
meantime airport officials are examining the contract with duty 
free shoppers and the two other firms to make sure they are legal 
and meet the intent of the citys minority contracting policy 
duty free shoppers said mir kanon and peideau make up 32 percent 
of the concession for the seven dutyfree shops and 18 percent of 
the concession for the 18 gift and news shops at the international 
airport the thirdbusiest in the world 
dixon revealed monday that his wife paid between 5000 and 
15000 for her investment in the two companies in 1986 he filed an 
amended financial disclosure statement in response to questions from 
the associated press 
in his earlier 1986 financial disclosure form dixon said the 
investment was worth between 100000 and 250000 at the end of 
1986 meaning the value of the shares soared in a sixmonth period

the chairmen of the house and senate 
agriculture committees praised the bush administration tuesday for 
allowing the sale of surplus us butter to the soviet union 
weeks ago president bush called me at home to talk about the 
soviet wheat sale said chairman patrick leahy dvt of the 
senate agriculture committee i told him i would support him but 
urged him to consider the soviet offer to buy our surplus butter 
leahy said he was glad agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
took my advice and is prepared to go ahead with the sale 
it makes more sense to sell surplus butter to the russians than 
to store it he said 
house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
also praised the move 
i support the sale of any agricultural commodity which we have 
in surplus which can be sold on the world market at a reasonable 
price 
yeutter announced monday that 75000 metric tons of surplus 
butter could be sold to the soviets at prices to be negotiated 
his department has estimated that 135000 to 140000 tons of 
butter will be in the us surplus inventory by sept 30 this 
compares to 73165 metric tons in september 1988 
recent reports from the departments commodity credit corp 
indicate the taxpayers have about 147 per pound invested in the 
surplus butter or around 3241 per metric ton

the installation of vapor recovery 
nozzles at thousands of california gasoline pumps has made a major 
contribution to clearer air and motorists early complaints have 
vanished state officials say 
we did have complaints at the beginning largely because the 
nozzles were so different from the hoses people were accustomed to 
and they were bulky and heavy said bill sessa spokesman for 
the california air resources board 
unfortunately this program began at about the same time most 
stations were converting to selfservice so that compounded the 
problem the first hoses were designed for attendant use sessa 
added 
but now he said i cant remember when i heard the last 
consumer complaint our program seems to have been accepted by the 
driving public 
although there are still bulky doublehose vapor recovery systems 
at many california stations most now are equipped with lightweight 
hoses which look and feel to the motorists like the preregulation 
hoses 
the nozzles are designed to capture air pollutioncausing 
hydrocarbons that evaporate from gasoline when it is pumped into a 
cars gas tank a vaporlock system routes the vapor back into the 
stations underground holding tanks where some of it condenses back 
into liquid 
california ordered vaporrecovery nozzles at service stations in 
urban areas where the smog problem is greatest in 1977 a phasein 
period covered 90 percent of the states 14000 stations by 1980 
regulations adopted in 1987 extended the requirement to stations in 
rural areas with the final few hundred due for conversion in the 
next six months 
new jersey required the states larger stations to have the 
nozzles jan 1 smaller stations must comply by next year new york 
city the district of columbia st louis and several florida cities 
have similar laws 
legislation to enact similar programs is pending in 
massachusetts tennessee vermont pennsylvania and oregon said s 
william becker executive director of the association of state and 
territorial air pollution program administrators in washington 
consumer complaints in california have diminished agreed art 
boswell spokesman for the california service station and automotive 
repair association but that doesnt mean there arent still 
problems he said 
the biggest complaint is theyre bulky and heavy when you get 
a lady of 110 pounds trying to maneuver a doublehose system its 
obviously a problem boswell said 
he said the other major concern of the service station owners is 
installation and operating costs 
the vapor recovery nozzle that the motorist sees is only one part 
of the recovery system a network of pipes must be installed to 
return the vapor to the storage tanks 
then the delivery tanker truck must be equipped with a larger 
version of the recovery nozzle to collect vapor from the stations 
storage tank and return it to the refinery for reprocessing 
boswell said that adds 3000 to 5000 to the cost of a new 
station but at least 10000 to 15000 to convert an existing 
station in addition to that the pumps have higher maintenance 
costs adding 1500 to 2000 a year to the average stations 
operating expenses 
the old nozzles cost 15 to 20 each vapor recovery nozzles 
are over 100 and the new lightweight ones are 300 per nozzle 
he said so it does make the price of gasoline go up 
boswell said the conversion costs have led to closures of some 
small stations 
it does a good job of collecting vapors theres no dispute 
over that boswell said but onboard canisters on the vehicles 
do a better job 
sessa said californias battle against air pollution involves so 
many interrelated actions including emission standards on 
vehicles vapor recovery at service stations and industrial plant 
emissions that it is impossible to sort out the exact effect of 
just one program 
but he described the vapor recovery requirement as a crucial 
component to the air quality effort because it reduces the amount of 
hydrocarbon gases in the atmosphere

the us government formally joined a 
highstakes technology battle with japan on tuesday when a pentagon 
agency picked five companies to receive government grants to develop 
highdefinition television 
the defense advanced research projects agency announced that it 
would immediately open negotiations with the five over how much 
money to give them 
the agency has committed roughly 30 million to the 
highdefinition or hdtv technology program and has received 87 
requests from corporations and laboratories for money 
the pentagon said it could not predict how many other contractors 
might receive grants 
there will definitely be other contractors selected however 
because the five selected tuesday are all working on the displays 
or what amounts to the picture tube in a standard tv for the new 
technology the agency said 
other grants are contemplated to companies working on 
highdefinition processor technology the computer brains 
needed to allow hdtv systems to receive manipulate and display 
pictures maps or video 
four of the five companies selected tuesday are working on 
socalled projection displays while the fifth is working on a 
plasma flat panel display similar to the liquidcrystal displays 
found on many watches and portable computers darpa said 
the four working on projection displays are newco inc of san 
jose calif raychem corp of menlo park calif texas instruments 
inc of dallas and projectavision inc of new york city 
the firm working on plasma displays is photonics technology inc 
of northwood ohio 
newco has told the pentagon it is working with a subcontractor 
identified as spectra physics inc raychem has listed the xerox 
corp as a subcontractor texas instruments has listed the david 
sarnoff research center in princeton nj as a subcontractor 
projectavision has not identified any partners 
texas instruments also is working on the plasma display 
technology as a subcontractor to photonics technology the 
university of michigan also is on the photonics team 
the pentagons primary goal is developing an advanced small 
tvtype screen that can display text characters or video signals 
with great clarity the monitors would be used inside new 
helicopters and airplanes training simulators other types of 
vehicles and ommand centers 
the department also hopes however that by providing money for 
new research it can help us electronic and semiconductor 
companies take the lead in developing the next generation of tv sets 
for commercial use 
highdefinition television offers the promise of sharper 
brighter and wider pictures 
a study by the economic policy institute released in march 
concluded the united states must move aggressively into the new hdtv 
and flatscreen display industries or lose more than 2 million jobs 
annually and suffer a 225 billion trade deficit in electronic goods 
by the year 2010 
if the united states does not compete effectively with the 
japanese and other nations in the hightechnology arena the 
personal computer and semiconductor industries alone could have 
respective deficits of 114 billion and 76 billion early in the 
next century the report said 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has estimated that hdtv sales 
in this country could reach 140 billion in the next 20 years

the energy department has failed to show it can 
ensure the safe operation of a nuclear waste dump in new mexico and 
may be unable to meet its september target for opening the 
repository a house committee chairman said tuesday 
rep mike synar dokla said in an interview that energy 
secretary jmes d watkins may be moving too fast on the 700 million 
project a central feature of watkins plan for cleaning up the 
enormous amounts of hazardous wastes that have been temporarily 
stored at nuclear weapons plants for 40 years 
there is no crisis that requires us to move so quickly said 
synar chairman of the house government operations subcommittee on 
environment energy and natural resources 
a spokeswoman for the department said it planned to go ahead with 
the first shipments of radioactive waste to the waste isolation 
pilot plant 2150 feet below the desert near carlsbad in september 
despite mounting congressional criticism 
were still of the opinion that we can do it said christina 
sankey 
a failure to open the repository in september could have serious 
ripple effects on the energy departments nuclear weapons complex 
which includes 16 major plants in 12 states 
idaho gov cecil andrus for example has said he will not accept 
further shipments of radioactive wastes from a colorado weapons 
plant beyond september the rocky flats plant near denver has no 
room to store its wastes and so might have to close down if idaho 
carries out its threat to block further shipments 
wastes from idaho colorado and other weapons sites was supposed 
to have begun moving into the new mexico repository last october 
but the opening was delayed because federal officials could not 
verify the safety of the design and construction 
in setting his september deadline andrus sought to force a 
speedup of the new mexico project idaho is concerned not only about 
waste coming into the state from colorado but also about a 
continuing buildup of hazardous waste generated at the departments 
idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho falls 
at a hearing before synars subcommittee monday the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress presented a 
legal opinion that any move by andrus to block further waste 
shipments into his state would be unconstitutional 
synar also criticized the energy departments training of 
emergency response officials in the states that will be traversed by 
the waste shipments the training is designed to ensure that local 
police firefighters doctors and others could respond to an 
accident involving the radioactive material 
theyve done good training but they dont have adequate 
records to find these people in the event they were needed synar 
said 
the dump is designed to permanently entomb about one million 
barrels of wastes from the manufacture of nuclear weapons 
contaminated with plutonium which remains radioactive for 24000 
years 
at a hearing before his subcommittee monday gao officials raised 
numerous objections to the departments plan for determining the 
suitability of the waste repository 
keith fultz director of the gaos energy issues office said 
in our opinion doe has not yet satisfactorily addressed all key 
issues he criticized the departments plan for putting about 
7000 barrels of waste in the repository in an initial 5year period 
testing period 
most of the waste that doe would store before making a 
preliminary determination of compliance with epas standards is not 
essential for that purpose he said

hundreds of industrial plants spread across 45 
states are violating water quality standards by releasing toxic 
chemicals into public waterways and must take steps to curb the 
pollution the environmental protection agency said tuesday 
rebecca hanmer epas assistant administrator for water said the 
state standards involved under federal guidelines are designed to 
protect aquatic life and the levels do not necessarily pose a health 
threat to humans 
however epa officials said the statistics provide the most 
detailed picture to date of the extent of water pollution from toxic 
chemical releases by industrial plants and make clear a need for 
tighter controls 
the agency said all but a handful of states have at least some 
waterways that are contaminated beyond what the government considers 
environmentally safe because of industrial releases of 126 toxic 
chemicals including a variety of substances believed to cause 
cancer 
ms hanmer said in most cases the companies or government 
entities involved have proper permits and are not violating any 
laws but they are under a federal directive to develop cleanup 
strategies to comply with the standards by a mid1992 deadline 
the epa provided no information on levels of releases into 
specific waterways 
the polluters include not only industry but a dozen federal 
facilities and 240 local water treatment plants that often are 
discharging pollutants from industrial sources 
the greatest concentration of releases stems from plants in the 
metal finishing pulp and paper and natural gas industries which 
account for better than 40 percent of the industrial polluters cited 
among the polluters also were several military bases energy 
department facilities and the alyeska pipeline service co in 
alaska which has been told to tighten its controls on dumping 
contaminated water used as ballast in oil tankers 
about 40 percent of the 879 polluters cited have submitted plans 
approved by the epa to bring the toxic releases into compliance by 
1992 the remainder have either submitted plans that were rejected 
or have yet to submit a compliance program officials said 
the epa findings gathered from the states indicated that 
879 facilities in 45 states were releasing toxic chemicals into 
nearby waterways beyond what government standards consider 
environmentally safe for aquatic life 
the releases include a broad range of chemicals including 
benzene mercury nickel lead asbestos arsenic cyanide and 
dioxin 
nearly 600 stretches of waterway are affected by the releases 
to a degree that they are in violation of state quality standards 
contamination of waterways by at least some of the 126 toxic 
chemicals was found in all but five states north dakota south 
dakota nebraska hawaii and vermont the largest number of 
polluters were found in pennsylvania washington state wyoming and 
indiana although epa officials said in some cases a state had more 
polluters because of tougher state standards 
epa officials suggested that while the statistics from the states 
provide the best indication so far on the scope of industrial 
pollution of the nations waterways they likely represent only a 
fraction of the harmful chemicals that are being released into 
lakes rivers and streams 
the statistics cover only 126 toxic chemicals and do not take 
into account pollution that comes from nonpoint sources such as 
runoffs from agriculture and mining 
if those sources are taken into account said the epa more than 
17000 stretches of waterway as much as 10 percent of all of the 
countrys streams and shoreline are believed to have levels of 
chemical contamination that warrants corrective action

pollutants smog and toxic chemicals from the air bush declared 
environmental gridlock must end 
despite disputes among energy mining chemical and environmental 
groups about what to do bush said theres one thing everyone 
agrees on we need action and we need it now 
he said competing interests in congress have jammed the avenue 
to action for more than a decade 
bush spoke to an audience of more than 1000 residents and 
tourists in a field at teton science school the craggy snowfilled 
teton mountains served as his backdrop brilliant blue skies and a 
blazing sun helped make it a pictureperfect day

120 an hour to 455 bush ordered that it be sent back with his 
veto and the bill returned capitol hill 59 minutes after it arrived 
at the white house 
in lincoln bush spoke before an enthusiastic crowd of thousands 
in a sports center he said alternative fuel is going to help us 
reconcile the automobile to our environment 
after touring an enginetechnology laboratory where tests showed 
that fuels blended with ethanol made from fermented corn and 
agricultural wastes burn cleaner than gasoline bush said we 
know its time to cut exhausts the question is how 
he called alternative fuels an american answer that can help 
reduce the countrys dependence on imported oil 
bush drove an ethanolpowered chevrolet corsica compact around a 
test track twice with nebraska gov kay orr in the passengers seat 
he said later i dont do a lot of driving these days so im 
not sure that im the best judge but i enjoyed the ride and it had 
a lot of pickup certainly got more pickup than the 14000pound 
presidential limousine sitting outside this place 
the environmental protection agency says vehicles that can use 
both gasoline and methanol a fuel distilled from natural gas or 
wood give off 30 percent less tailpipe pollution while vehicles 
that use only methanol show an 80 percent reduction 
bushs cleanair proposals won general praise from 
environmentalists who said his package will be the framework for 
the first overhaul of the clean air act since 1977 
in particular environmentalists cheered the fact that the 
initiative originated at the white house after eight years of 
silence on environmental matters from ronald reagan 
in the pristine wilderness of the grand teton national park bush 
said every american deserves to breath clean air and you 
shouldnt have to drive 2000 miles to come out here to do it 
environmental gridlock must end 
on monday bush toured a fireblackened geyser basin in 
yellowstone national park 
he told the teton audience that he marveled at natures 
regenerative power but said whether restoring a forest or the air 
that flows above it nature needs our help 
bush said the medical wastes that washed up on east coast shores 
last year and the wandering garbage barge that nearly couldnt find 
a port helped provide the jolt we that needed for environmental 
action 
some say we are running out of time bush said wrong the 
only thing we are running out of is imagination and the will to 
bring what we can imagine to life 
repeating his oftstated phrase that there is a new wind 
blowing bush said that borne upon that wind is a new breed of 
environmentalism 
our mission is not just to defend whats left but to take the 
offense to improve our environment across the board 
bush said even the tetons cannot escape the threat of 
pollution it comes not from steam engines and logging saws which 
threatened the park in earlier years but from the very west wind 
that shaped those peaks bearing the often invisible poisons that 
gust in from the sunbaked smog of our cities 
bush who has visited the tetons several times said he 
frequently hears people say how nice it is to get away from urban 
pollution 
well the bad news is it can follow you here but the good 
news is were not going to put up with it any longer not here not 
at home where you summer visitors live most of your lives 
bush used his speech to announce his selection of john turner a 
wyoming state senator as director of the us fish and wildlife 
service turner owns a ranch in jackson hole 
national park service police removed several demonstrators before 
bush arrived for his speech the protestors had signs denouncing 
bushs handling of the valdez oil spill jim northup of the national 
park service said they were arrested for demonstrating in a national 
park without a permit and were taken to the teton county jail

president bush on tuesday vetoed legislation 
to raise the hourly minimum wage to 455 swiftly asserting himself 
in his first domestic policy clash with congress and its majority 
democrats 
bush traveling in the midwest vetoed the measure less than an 
hour after it arrived at the white house upstaging democratic 
congressional leaders who were still preparing for an event designed 
as a final plea to him to sign the measure 
the democrats promised to try wednesday to override the veto 
with new house speaker thomas s foley saying he would work through 
the night seeking the 30 or so additional votes he would need 
prospects seemed even less positive for the democrats in the senate 
white house aides joked about the speed with which the veto came 
however democrats said the swiftness only highlighted insensitivity 
to minimumwage workers who last saw an increase in 1981 
in a message to congress accompanying the first veto of his 
administration bush said the democrats bill would hurt those it 
was designed to help 
this bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive 
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities bush 
said in a message that ran more than 1500 words he repeated 
arguments the administration unsucessfully made in trying to 
persuade congress to adopt a more modest increase to 425 an hour 
the bill congress approved would damage the employment 
prospects of our young people and least advantaged citizens the 
veto message said it would accelerate inflation it would not 
help those in poverty and thus it would fail to properly reflect 
the thought behind this measure to help our lowest paid workers 
the democrats attacked those arguments as unfounded and promised 
to advance another bill should they fail to override the veto they 
also took bush to task for refusing to support the minimum wage 
increase at a time he is seeking to expand capital gains tax breaks 
enjoyed primarily by the wealthy 
it is particularly offensive to millions of poor working 
americans that president bush would veto a bill over 30 cents an 
hour at the same time that he is pushing hard to give a 
30000ayear tax cut to the very richest americans senate 
majority leader george mitchell said those are not the proper 
priorities for our nation nor should they be for the president 
robert l martin director of the chamber of commerces employee 
relations policy center said we are encouraged by the 
presidents action today but gerald w mcentee president of the 
american federation of state county and muncipal employees said 
this veto is a slap in the face of the working poor 
foley facing a major confrontation with the white house in his 
first full week as speaker refused to answer directly when asked 
whether he had any realistic chance of gaining the votes needed to 
override a veto 
hope springs eternal foley said with a broad smile 
but even if foley could deliver the votes in the house bush 
appears destined to prevail thirtyfive republican senators have 
signed a letter pledging to back bush in the veto fight two more 
votes than the gop would need to sustain a veto in the senate 
the chief sponsors of the legislation sen edward m kennedy 
dmass and rep augustus hawkins dcalif vowed to revive the 
issue if bush wins the initial fight 
there will be an increase in the minimum wage said kennedy 
if not today then soon 
in his message bush again called on congress to pass his own 
proposal which would boost the minimum wage from its current level 
of 335 an hour to 425 by january 1992 bushs measure also would 
allow employers to pay all new hires a subminimum wage for six 
months a provision he said would prevent most of the job loss he 
believes would be triggered by a higher minimum wage 
democrats contest the jobloss projections as unfounded and 
consider bushs subminimum wage proposal a cloaked attempt to allow 
employers to create a new underclass of lowwage workers 
the kennedyhawkins bill calls for a 455 an hour minimum wage 
by october 1991 with the first incremental increase taking effect 
this year and contains a far more restrictive provision allowing a 
subminimum to be paid to workers with less than 60 days work 
experience 
my difference with the congress is not just about 30 cents an 
hour bush said in the veto measure it is about hundreds of 
thousands of jobs that would be preserved by my administrations 
approach as opposed to those that would be sacrificed under the 
excessive increase included in this legislation 
mitchell insisted he was not surprised by the swiftness of the 
veto but the leaders seemed caught off guard kennedy and hawkins 
had printed statements urging bush to reconsider only to be told by 
mitchell just before the democrats event was to begin that his 
office had just been informed of the veto 
white house officials said the bill arrived at the white house at 
139 pm and bush traveling on air force one from wyoming to 
nebraska was notified by a clerk bush signed a prepared veto 
message he had taken on the trip and at 155 pm authorized the 
white house to affix his signature to another copy of the message 
and immediately return it to the capitol 
bush said that if congress is unwilling to accept his approach 
toward raising the minimum wage he would examine the possibility of 
raising the earned income tax credit to help the working poor 
the credit originally designed to offset social security taxes 
paid by the working poor can be worth up to 874 a year to a 
working family with children

curios beijing residents gawked at heavily guarded 
tiananmen square when they were allowed to cycle and drive around it 
tuesday for the first time since the army seized it from student 
protesters june 4 
pedestrians were not permitted and soldiers and traffic police 
allowed no stopping as bicyclists and cars passed nearly 40 tanks 
and armored personnel carriers along the northern edge of the square 
and a dozen at the southern end rolls of barbed wire lined southern 
corners of the 100acre square which was nearly empty 
soldiers armed with rifles stood every 15 feet along the 
perimeter facing outward 
the stone slabs that pave the square looked charred and scraped 
in places but there was no other sign of the battle that raged on 
its edges the night of june 34 when tanks roared in from the east 
and west some students say the army also fired on protesters inside 
the square but the government denies this 
most of the shooting was on changan avenue the main road to the 
square 
the government says nearly 300 people were killed most of them 
soldiers chinese witnesses and western intelligence say the toll 
could be as high as 3000 most of them civilians 
tiananmen square is the physical and symbolic center of beijing 
on one side stands the former imperial palace on another the great 
hall of the people the current seat of government 
protesters traditionally have taken their causes to tiananmen 
from college students who protested chinas ceding territorial 
rights to foreign countries in 1919 to the tens of thousands who 
occupied the square in april and may to demand dialogue with the 
government a free press and an end to corruption 
the square also is a favorite place for beijing residents to 
stroll fly kites and eat popsicles 
soldiers quickly cleaned up the students tents and banners but 
the 10day delay in reopening the square indicates it took longer to 
erase other signs of the occupation and violent recapture some 
television broadcasts in the past week showed soldiers scrubbing 
graffiti off the squares monument to revolutionary heroes and 
scraping up charred debris 
also opened for the first time in weeks was the imperial palace 
one of beijings top tourist attractions however visitors were 
directed to the north gate and a large portion of the palace 
compound in the south closest to the square was closed without 
explanation 
hundreds of chinese tourists most from out of town pressed 
their eyes to cracks in the gate of the closed section but could see 
only a vast expanse of empty courtyard 
when you stand here its as if nothing happened a young 
woman from the central city of nanjing said leaning on a carved 
marble baluster and watched birds circle over the palaces yellow 
tile roofs

mikhail s gorbachev took his message 
of reconciliation and peace directly to the west german people 
tuesday and later said the warm welcome in bonn made him feel as if 
he were in red square 
thousands cheered the soviet president in bonns packed market 
square 
i think this is the biggest thing happening in our 
relationship the striving of our people to cooperate and be 
friends gorbachev told the crowd 
later he told soviet spokesman gennady i gerasimov the welcome 
was so enthusiastic he felt as if he was on red square among his 
own people 
relaying gorbachevs words gerasimov told reporters the 
reception made a strong emotional impression on gorbachev and 
the entire kremlin delegation 
more than 3000 people crowded into the square outside the 
18thcentury town hall under sunny skies to greet the kremlin 
leader they chanted gorby gorby and waved soviet flags and a 
banner saying keep up the good work gorby 
cheers and applause rang through the square after the soviet 
anthem was played 
several wellwishers fainted in the crush of bodies behind police 
barricades 
some banners reflected the german pain at the postwar division of 
their nation and of the former capital berlin telling gorbachev 
german unity peace in europe and in english gorby make 
love not walls that referred to the berlin wall 
but the crowd hooted and hissed in disapproval when mayor hans 
daniels in a brief speech before a ceremonial exchange of gifts 
referred to bonn as only the temporary capital of germany 
substituting for berlin 
gorbachev and his wife raisa were given a tumultuous greeting as 
they emerged from their limousine and ascended the steps of the 
newly renovated town hall 
when mrs gorbachev spotted 4yearold heinrichsebastian 
schilling clad in traditional leather short pants and waving to 
her she quickly beckoned him to the balcony where she stood with 
her husband 
the couple hoisted the boy between them and mrs gorbachev waved 
the posy the youngster gave her as the crowd again chanted gorby 
gorby 
as police helicopters whirred overhead and sharpshooters scanned 
the crowd from rooftops gorbachev said we are opening a new 
chapter in our relations 
after the ceremony gorbachev greeted wellwishers behind police 
barricades smiling and shaking hands along the way 
a weekend poll conducted by the television network zdf indicates 
that 90 percent of west germans trust gorbachev and his policies of 
reform and disarmament 
a whitehaired woman who said she lost her brother in the soviet 
union during world war ii called it a great honor for gorbachev 
to visit bonn 
we have great hopes that gorbachev can offer a new future that 
will benefit both germanys a 21yearold student martina 
feldmann told the associated press 
gorbachev said tuesday he likes bonns smalltown atmosphere 
he said of the citys greenery and residential character i 
hope you can preserve that 
at a welcoming ceremony he noted that west germans often refer 
to bonn as a big federal village and he added i think in 
this case its good 
bonn with a population of 300000 is about the size of 
stavropol the southern russian city that gorbachev managed for many 
years as communist party chief 
gorbachev grew up on a farm in the stavropol area 
bonn was chosen as a temporary capital of west germany after 
world war ii by officials who expected someday to return the capital 
to berlin

the future of the american newspaper may 
depend on such small things as delivering the paper on time and 
offering prompt refunds for failing to do so the president and 
chief executive officer of knightridder inc said tuesday 
james k batten spoke at a general session on the second day of 
the threeday convention of the american newspaper publishers 
association 
much of the first two days was devoted to discussions of 
competition from other media for customers and advertisers and 
technology has been a recurring theme 
however the real danger to the future of newspapers is not as 
much an identifiable competitor as it is the mental attitude of 
publishers editors reporters printers and circulation personnel 
batten said 
i think the real danger lies in assuming that because our 
history has been so successful we can take our continued success 
for granted as some sort of mystical right decreed by the founding 
fathers he said 
specifically we have to develop a new fierce commitment to 
publishing newspapers and strain to satisfy our customers every day 
the days when we could do newspapers our way and tell the world to 
go to hell if they didnt like the results are gone forever 
if we persist in doing things the way we want to do them out of 
ignorance or foolish pride or muleheadedness our customers are 
going to fade away if we look for ways to tell our customers yes 
instead of no if we look for quality for the customers not just 
ourselves if we never take customers for granted if we make their 
satisfaction our central urgent daytoday priority then our 
future will be every bit as good as our past and as we all know 
that has been very good indeed 
one way to satisfy customers is to give to the people who contact 
them every day the power to resolve problems and satisfy complaints 
recognizing that fact we need to turn the authority pyramid 
upsidedown so power flows to the front lines where customers are 
being handled in ways that either please them or frustrate them day 
after day he said 
he said one west coast newspaper gave its customerrelations 
staff its rules for dealing with complaints written on one side of a 
small piece of paper it read this way rule no 1 use your good 
judgment in all situations there will be no additional rules he 
said 
he said that when he took over at knightridder he discovered 
that some circulation agents lacked authority to give a 25cent 
credit for missed delivery 
remember that a 10year personal subscriber is valued at 
anywhere from 4000 to 8500 he said these people were 
presiding personally over customers worth from 11 million to 18 
million over the next decade but we werent empowering them to 
extend a 25cent credit without clearing with the boss that was 
crazy and we fixed that 
he said moneyback service guarantees might be one way to keep 
subscribers and advertisers happy and advised publishers to 
encourage their reporters to get close to their communities 
most of it he said is just a new way of looking at the business 
whatever else we do to get closer to readers and advertisers 
we have to guarantee that our newspapers will be their newspapers 
not reporters newspapers or editors newspapers or publishers 
newspapers he said we run customers newspapers

the west point honor system should formally 
recognize that every proven violation of the academys strict honor 
code does not result in expulsion an advisory commission 
recommended tuesday 
if the sanction could feasibly be rehabilitation or 
forgiveness then you would probably be much more willing to turn in 
your roommate or counsel him and he would be more willing to 
admit his guilt or explain what he had done said wesley posvar 
chairman of the special commission of the chief of staff on the 
honor code and the honor system 
i think in a process like that these 18 or 19yearold people 
would become more mature 
the recommendation was among 25 changes suggested by the group 
which has just completed a sixmonths study of the honor system 
one major suggested change was to abolish the term quibbling 
which in academy parlance means intentional deception or untruth 
through use of vague or ambiguous language 
but basing charges on ambiguous use of language can produce 
ambiguity of guilt itself and a case can therefore be made for 
dropping employment of the word quibbling the report stated 
intentional deception would still be an offense 
the 13member commission submitted its report to the secretary of 
the army who has ultimate authority over the us military academy 
at west point 
under the code which states a cadet will not lie cheat or 
steal nor tolerate those who do west pointers are required to 
turn themselves in or blow the whistle on classmates for rules 
violations the report said many cadets have been deterred from 
following the code knowing that violators faced possible expulsion 
gorden estimated that in the last two years there have been from 
150 to 160 honor cases annually out of a corps of 4417 of those 
cases 30 to 40 have gone to trial and six to 12 cadets have been 
expelled each year 
the report also suggested changing the language of the code to 
put the onus on unethical acts rather than on cadets who commit 
them it advocated changing the language of the code to a cadet 
will not lie cheat or steal nor tolerate such acts by other 
cadets 
posvar said some of the changes recommended are just codifying 
actual practices at the academy 
in fact the superintendent and the authorities have made 
certain exceptions in special circumstances when there are 
extenuating circumstances misunderstanding poor communication and 
cadets have been retained forgiven if you will or 
rehabilitated he said at a news conference in the pentagon 
therefore rehabilitated cadets were as persons being 
tolerated they were retained it was the act it was the act of 
lying cheating or stealing that was prohibited not the person now 
thats a fine point but it doesnt change the essence of the code 
the report recommended against publishing a rigid schedule of 
alternatives to expulsion but rather a general categorization is 
appropriate 
these might include separation expulsion temporary 
reassignment to a rehabilitating position in the army suspension 
without pay or special measure such as counseling rehabilitation 
and probation the study said 
brig gen fred a gorden the west point commandant said the 
cadets have also recently completed a study of the honor system and 
made many of the same recommendations as the commission 
the commission was established to study the code in an atmosphere 
free from concern over a pattern of cases such as the widespread 
cheating scandal of 1976 when 136 cadets were expelled or the 
footballbased cheating scandal of 1951 which led to 83 expulsions

palestinian leaders in the occupied gaza strip 
on tuesday asked us ambassador william brown to urge the united 
states to step up its middle east peace efforts 
the israeli army demolished four houses and sealed seven others 
in the occupied west bank to punish palestinians accused of attacks 
on troops and on arabs suspected of collaborating with israel 
arabs in gaza met with brown as he made his first trip to the 
territory home to more than 700000 palestinians since he became 
ambassador in december 
we strongly suggested there has to be more serious intervention 
on the part of the united states to get people moving said lawyer 
fayez abu rahme who attended a luncheon meeting with brown two 
physicians also participated 
rahme said the palestinians were critical of israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs peace initiative which calls for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to select 
palestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy settlement for the 
lands 
the bush administration has backed the initiative but expressed 
concern that a lack of details especially on the final status of 
the territories will discourage palestinian acceptance 
rahme would not elaborate on specific palestinian requests but 
said participants told brown there can be no elections without a 
withdrawal of israel troops or international supervision israel 
rejects both ideas 
us embassy officials described browns visit as an 
orientation trip but gave no details brown declined to talk with 
reporters 
at least 516 palestinians and 22 israelis have been killed since 
the uprising against israeli occupation of the territories began in 
december 1987 israel has controlled the territories since capturing 
them from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
palestinian groups opposed to plo chairman yasser arafats 
attempts to negotiate with israel issued a statement in damascus 
syria on tuesday condemning egypt for sending a top official to 
israel 
butros ghali egypts minister of state for foreign affairs went 
to jerusalem this week to offer egypts services as a mediator 
between israel and the palestine liberation organization on the 
election proposal 
we warn our people to be awake to foil the moves of ghali and 
arafat said the palestine national salvation front 
an army spokesman said troops demolished the palestinian homes 
and sealed the others following arrests of arab attackers 
they included 49 arabs in the west bank town of nablus accused of 
being part of a squad with links to arafats fatah wing of the plo 
said the spokesman who cannot be identified under military rules 
one of the houses sealed was in the askar refugee camp near 
nablus the army said cement blocks were thrown from the house in 
april slightly injuring several soldiers 
ahmed shtawi 42 who owned the house said no one in his family 
was detained in connection with the incident and they should not be 
penalized for the acts of others 
the united states and international human rights organizations 
have condemned house demolitions saying they deny people due 
process under the law since suspects rarely are tried before their 
houses are destroyed 
the arabrun human rights group al haqlaw in the service of man 
says the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in the 
west bank and 58 in the gaza strip since the start of the uprising 
police minister chaim barlev told parliament police arrested two 
palestinian suspects in the murder of oren baharami a 13yearold 
israeli who was sexually molested and killed in the tel aviv suburb 
of jaffa two months ago 
he identified the suspects as a 26yearold man from gaza city 
and a 30yearold resident of rafah 
hundreds of arab prisoners in northern israel rioted at megiddo 
military jail for security offenders late tuesday after soldiers 
fired tear gas at prisoners who refused to leave their tent to be 
counted the army said 
the riot lasted less than an hour and three prisoners were 
treated for tear gas inhalation the army said israel radio 
reported 22 prisoners injured and 10 hospitalized and said a cloud 
of tear gas floated 2 miles away

more than 150 members of the house sent a 
letter to president bush on tuesday urging him to uphold all current 
antiabortion policies 
the 154 lawmakers said they were concerned that efforts will be 
made during this congress to subvert prolife policies by diluting 
or repealing laws that prohibit federal funding of or involvement in 
abortion here at home as well as overseas 
they urged bush to send an early clear and unmistakable 
signal of your intention to veto any appropriations or authorization 
measure that would undo or weaken current law regarding abortion 
the representatives number more than the onethird that would be 
needed to sustain a presidential veto 
rep chris smith rnj cochairman of the congressional 
prolife caucus said the letter was not aimed at a particular 
effort to change us abortion policy which prohibits federal funds 
to encourage or provide abortions where the life of the mother is 
not in danger 
but he said that with a decision expected soon in a missouri 
abortion case before the supreme court more action on the issue is 
expected 
smith also said such efforts are likely to be made if congress 
fails to enact a fiscal 1990 budget on time and is forced to fund 
government operations with stopgap measures which continue spending 
levels of the year before but allow amendments to slip through more 
easily 
additionally he noted that a draft rewrite of the foreign 
assistance act in the senate would reverse two current abortion 
policies one of the current policies bars funding of any 
organization that supports coercive abortions as practiced by some 
countries including china the other bars funding of any 
organization that promotes abortions overseas

transportation secretary samuel skinner warned 
the nations airlines tuesday that he would stop the buying and 
selling of international routes when it affects competition 
skinner in a letter sent to 28 airlines asserted the 
departments responsibility to review all foreign route sales 
although the justice department has had antitrust law authority over 
airlines since jan 1 
the action was the latest in a series of steps the transportation 
department has taken to discourage actions that might inhibit 
competition in the deregulated airline industry 
skinner earlier expressed concern about proposed takeover of 
northwest airlines by pan american or other suitors northwest has 
so far rejected takeover attempts he also asked the justice 
department to look into a planned merger of airline reservation 
systems owned by delta and american airlines 
skinner did not mention any specific airline route sale in his 
letter and department spokesman hal paris said it was meant to 
apply to any potential sale of international routes 
the justice department has already said it would oppose in court 
eastern airlines plans to sell its philadelphiacanada routes and 
other assets to usair because usair already has nearly a third of 
the flights at philadelphia 
i view with some concern the prospect that carriers might 
endeavor to sell these valuable international routes after having 
been selected to operate them skinner said adding that some 
routes might be acquired primarily for their sale value 
the department approves all applications for international routes 
skinner said the sale of routes may affect a carriers ability to 
remain an effective competitor or adversely affect industry 
balance 
in his letter skinner said the department would scrutinize all 
international route transactions 
where we find that the competitive and service benefits that we 
sought to achieve in making a significant route award would be 
undermined by a route sale we will consider giving the incumbent 
carrier the choice of either continuing to operate its service or 
relinquishing its certificate in order that the route can be 
reawarded through another selection proceeding skinner said 
he said the approach was designed to ensure that route sales 
strengthen rather than diminish the competitiveness of the us 
airline industry

ciriaco de mita who has been caretaker premier since 
his government fell three weeks ago was chosen tuesday to form a 
new government and said he would try to resurrect the same 
fiveparty coalition 
he also said no progress could be made in negotiating italys 
49th government since world war ii until after european parliament 
elections sunday 
both de mitas christian democrats and their socialist rivals had 
hoped president francesco cossiga would delay naming a 
premierdesignate until next week but opposition parties said the 
delay had brought most government work to a standstill 
after meeting with cossiga the premier said he would seek to 
form a government based on an alliance of parties receiving the 
constant growing consensus of italians 
his reference was to several local elections the latest in 
sardinia last weekend in which christian democrats socialists and 
smaller parties in the coalition posted gains 
de mita resigned may 19 after socialist leader bettino craxi said 
he could no longer support the governing coalition he accused de 
mita of failing to show leadership craxi is a former premier and 
has made no secret of wanting the job back 
with nearly all votes counted in the sardinia election the 
christian democrats long italys dominant party had 349 percent 
of the vote up from 322 percent five years ago and the socialists 
139 percent up from 101 percent 
the communists the no 2 party and currently in a slump dropped 
to 231 percent from 287 percent in the last election the rest of 
the vote went to smaller or regional parties 
political commentators said the results showed voters support the 
coalition which also includes the social democratic republican and 
liberal parties 
they also noted however that the trend has not eased the 
rivalry between the christian democrats and socialists

jerry vines was reelected president of the 
southern baptist convention tuesday maintaining the conservative 
resurgence within the nations largest protestant denomination 
vines pastor of first baptist church of jacksonville fla 
captured 565 percent of the vote in defeating his moderate 
challenger daniel vestal pastor of dunwoody baptist church in 
suburban atlanta 
vines received 10754 votes to 8248 for vestal in the 11th 
straight victory for conservative candidates since 1979 
more than 20000 messengers or delegates registered for the 
threeday annual meeting of the 148 millionmember southern baptist 
convention which opened tuesday morning 
moderates who came within 700 votes of defeating vines last 
year had hoped the relatively low turnout for the convention 
outside the bible belt would work in their favor with conservatives 
unable to bus delegates in for the election as many as 45500 
delegates have attended recent conventions 
but conservatives counted on the power of the incumbency no 
incumbent president seeking a second oneyear term has lost in 
recent years and until the moderateconservative controversy 
incumbents rarely encountered opposition 
in his presidential address before the election vines 51 
delivered a sermon on evangelism saying it is the one thing all 
southern baptists can agree on 
it is time for our denomination to get on the go he said 
vestal 44 made his lastminute appeals to voters via 
television paying for halfhour programs on a local station sunday 
and monday evenings 
he said in his televised address the election would determine 
whether southern baptists will be committed to openness and 
freedom and unity 
both candidates are biblical inerrantists who believe the bible 
is without error but their different approaches to doctrinal issues 
reflect the divisions within the nations largest protestant 
denomination 
vestal said conservatives have been engaged in a power struggle 
for control of the denomination that has run roughshod over the 
central baptist belief in the priesthood of the believer or that 
christians are able to interpret the bible for themselves 
i think the issue is freedom are southern baptists going to be 
free or are we going to be a controlled denomination are we going 
to be creedal or noncreedal he said 
vines said issues such as whether the world was created in six 
days or whether the bible permits the ordination of women are 
matters of interpretation baptists can legitimately disagree about 
but he and other conservatives contend there is a need to set 
stricter parameters on theological teachings to preserve 
denominational unity on central tenants of faith 
if the truth of the bible is questioned vines said even the 
accounts of the resurrection of jesus are open to dispute 
the appointive power of the denominations presidents allows them 
to exert control over its institutions and agencies 
but moderates have shown increasing strength in recent years 
winning elections at the state level in texas georgia north 
carolina south carolina virginia and tennessee at last years 
national convention in san antonio vines received just 505 percent 
of the vote in defeating richard jackson a moderate pastor from 
phoenix 
the denomination grew rapidly in the 60s and 70s to surpass a 
declining united methodist church as the nations largest protestant 
denomination but has grown by barely more than half a percent each 
of the last two years the lowest growth rate since 1937

want to buy a ski resort at a bargain without 
leaving the comfort of your living room it was no problem tuesday 
for bidders in one of the worlds largest real estate auctions 
conducted via satellite 
the bid for the maple valley ski area in west dummerston 
vermont came from one of the three million satellite dish owners 
around the country who tuned into an auction of more than 200 
million in real estate 
some of them bid by telephone to the auction which took place at 
a convention hall attended by investors and brokers 
the 370acre ski area which sold for 12 million was one of 71 
properties in new england texas florida and south carolina 
auctioned tuesday at estimated prices ranging from 250000 to 20 
million 
the parcels were varied one man got a steal with his high bid of 
35000 for three houses in odessa texas one of the biggest 
properties was a twintower apartment complex near the ocean in 
lynn mass that was expected to sell for about 25 million 
more than 400 people joined about 100 satellite dish owners who 
had preregistered with the organizers of the event the 
indianabased kruse international a real estate auction company 
kruse along with the bostonbased investment network of america 
created the concept of mixing high technology with oldfashioned 
auctioneering 
kruse held the first satellite real estate auction in november in 
chicago and two more are planned for the fall 
this is the marketing method of the future proclaimed dean 
kruse chief auctioneer of kruse international as telemarketing 
grows buyers and sellers are more comfortable with selling by 
satellite 
kruse barked out bids with the distinctive guttural roll of a 
veteran auctioneer and sprinkled his bids with the quaint hyperbole 
of a rural auction 
this is as good as it gets he crowed during one pitch for an 
office complex in connecticut 
but as he spoke he was flanked by two huge video screens that 
beamed his likeness and photographs of the properties to the 
audience at the hynes convention center and around the country and 
he began many of the bids at well over 1 million 
most of the bidders in boston were serious businessmen who sat 
grimly in their seats scanning the auction brochure for good 
investment properties 
baker salsbury an investor from new haven conn sat in the 
back row looking harried as he scribbled down bids in a notebook 
and pressed the buttons on his calculator to figure out mortgages 
and loans 
this is my first time so i dont know what to expect said 
salsbury who said he was willing to bid a total of between 10 and 
20 million tuesday russell bard 51 of wales maine who came 
with his wife rita was more relaxed about raising his hand and 
parting with cash bard had to defer to his wife when asked which 
properties he bid on because he couldnt remember one of bards 
highest bids was 21 million for a 63000 square foot industrial 
park in lowell 
i got one property to sell and ill probably buy a couple 
said bard im not used to real estate auctions i usually go to 
car auctions 
like others at the auction who registered the highest bids for 
each property bard said he would not know until the end of the 
event if the parcel had been sold to him the final decision is up 
to the seller all of whom came to represent their properties

a senator says attempts by balticamerican 
groups to halt the deportation of those suspected of nazi war crimes 
to the soviet union has no connection with his support for the long 
fight for freedom in three countries absorbed by the soviets 
sen donald riegle dmich and reps dennis hertel dmich 
and don ritter rpa arranged for a capitol hill reception to be 
held wednesday sponsored by the joint baltic american national 
committee and the baltic american freedom league marking baltic 
freedom day 
the baltic states of latvia lithuania and estonia lost an 
estimated 20 percent of their population during world war ii through 
executions mass deportations and flight out of the countries 
baltic freedom day commemorates those baltic republics and the 
people there who died at the hands of the nazis and during the 
soviet takeover in 1940 
riegle said on monday that the deportation issue has nothing to 
do with my interest and involvement over many years to try to bring 
about whats happening and that is the unraveling of the russian 
empire 
on tuesday he issued a statement saying i feel personally that 
all war criminals must be brought to justice and punished and i 
strongly support the executive branch of our government on deporting 
suspected war criminals when the facts warrant 
since the mid1980s the committee and the league have attempted 
to block efforts by the justice department to deport warcrimes 
suspects to the soviet union for trial 
the groups which deny they are pronazi or antisemitic say 
they oppose the deportations because the soviet system lacks due 
process and the deportations may constitute diplomatic recognition 
of the soviet takeover 
the joint baltic american national committee wants all war 
criminals whether communist or fascist to be brought to justice 
mariann rikken estonian representative to the committee said 
monday 
the organization is unhappy with the concept of making the 
soviets an equal partner in justice she said 
chip berlet of political research associates a research 
institute based in cambridge mass that studies issues related to 
authoritarianism and fascism said some eastern european emigre 
movements split over the question of collaborating with the nazism 
and most of the movements that survived intact did so because of 
collaboration 
after the soviet union absorbed the baltic nations the 
organizations in exile sought to bury their differences in a common 
antisoviet cause berlet said 
the organizations antisoviet stance has pitted them against the 
justice departments office of special investigations which handles 
cases involving nazi war crimes 
anthony mazeika at the time vice president of the baltic 
american freedom league and now a director of the organization was 
active in 1985 efforts to lobby against the osis search for war 
criminals among eastern european emigrants 
mazeika and officers of the joint baltic american national 
committee through an organization called the coalition for 
constitutional justice and security also fought the osis 
deportation in 1987 of karl linnas of new york linnas was an 
estonian who became an american citizen in 1959 and was sentenced to 
death by a soviet court after his conviction for the deaths of 
thousands in a concentration camp in estonia 
we are not saying that these people are innocent or that 
perhaps there could be some guilt said angela nelsas vice 
president of the baltic american freedom league 
the organization would like to change the law so that american 
citizens can receive the same due process of law that is expected in 
the united states through criminal trials in the united states 
she said neither hertel nor ritter responded to requests monday and 
tuesday for comment 
the osi said its only contact with the baltic groups was when 
they were lobbying against a deportation frankly i dont pay too 
much attention to them said osi head neal shear

the shedd aquarium is building a huge 43 million 
oceanarium but its having trouble obtaining whales to fill the 
complex amid waves of protest from activists opposed to capturing 
the mammals 
these captures raise havoc with the wild whale population they 
disrupt the family units other whales are injured and some are 
killed said edward morlan director of the midwest whale 
protection federation 
the federation is one of eight animal rights and environmental 
groups that filed a lawsuit monday in us district court in 
washington to block the aquarium from importing from japan three 
pacific black whales also known as false killer whales 
the lawsuit comes a week after canadas government refused the 
aquariums request for permission to buy three beluga whales from 
hudson bayarea eskimos 
neither species is considered endangered 
despite the objections there will be whales in the complex when 
it opens in fall 1990 said aquarium associate director david 
lonsdale 
we were surprised over the controversy lonsdale said we 
feel we are conservationists we preach conservation in all of our 
messages 
he said the canadians were concerned more about where the whales 
would be kept before the exhibit opened and not the exhibit space 
itself the aquarium has said the whales will be housed at an 
aquarium outside chicago while its oceanarium is completed 
the shedd will reapply for a canadian permit next year lonsdale 
said 
as envisioned the oceanarium will be a 170000squarefoot 
exhibit with a 2 milliongallon pool for the false killer whales and 
a 400000gallon pool for the belugas the 43 million construction 
cost is coming from a variety of sources including state aid 
the lawsuit said the federal permit shedd received for importing 
the animals from japan should be revoked until that country bans its 
fishermen from killing whales 
the japanese annually drive false killer whales to shore and 
slaughter them with harpoons or knives sparing a few for sale to 
aquariums said sandy goldberg an attorney for the sierra club 
legal defense fund one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit 
ms goldberg said the department of commerce permit violates a 
us law banning the importation of marine mammals from countries 
that dont give the animals the same protection they have in the 
united states 
we want to protect the wild populations and stop the killings 
in japan ms goldberg said this is no way to do it by paying 
them to save a few 
the other plaintiffs are greenpeace usa the humane society of 
the united states the american humane association the 
international wildlife coalition the cetacean society international 
and the animal protection institute of america 
aquarium officials deny any laws were broken they contend that 
if they didnt import the whales the animals would be slaughtered 
and that the exhibits benefit people who have no other place to 
learn about the creatures 
were serving an important function lonsdale said the 
educational value of the exhibits is they help people understand 
conservationist concerns 
while the plaintiffs acknowledge the exhibits help increase 
awareness of the whales plight many say they oppose confining 
creatures that normally range thousands of miles 
education cant take priority over protecting the animals in 
the wild ms goldberg said we dont want to protect the whales 
by putting them all in aquariums 
lonsdale countered that the aquarium handles marine animals with 
utmost care 
we feel we do the best job we can of keeping the animals he 
said their life here is very good they have a very pleasant 
existence

scientific researchers in american universities 
should be required to disclose financial relationships with industry 
that might create conflicts of interest a congressional 
subcommittee was told tuesday 
biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within 
universities over a relatively short period of time said sheldon 
krimsky associate professor of urban and environmental policy at 
tufts university i have heard it said within the scientific 
community that everyone gains from this marriage of academia and 
commerce nothing can be further from the truth 
not only are there losses but some of these losses threaten 
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public 
confidence in science 
krimsky said that at least 45 per cent of the biomedical faculty 
at harvard as an example have formal affiliations with 36 
biotechnology companies 
he called for disclosure of financial interests related to 
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants 
dr george d lundberg vice president for scientific information 
of the american medical association cautioned however that 
barring researchers from working in areas where they had a financial 
interest would be devastating and we would lose many qualified 
people and we would lose much information that would have come from 
those people if they had worked 
a lot of things motivate human beings and moneys one of the 
big ones lundberg said 
he said that if he had been a journal editor in 1905 looking for 
somebody to write an article on automobiles he would have asked 
henry ford 
would henry ford have been in conflict of interest totally 
he said would i care no id love that hed know the most about 
it 
david noble a professor of history at drexel university who is 
suing the massachusetts institute of technology on grounds that he 
was fired for speaking out against conflicts of interest said 
university researchers are free to make undisclosed arrangements 
with private corporations in which they often have equally 
undisclosed personal roles 
they are free to shape and profit from the public investment in 
research and many have done so he said he argued that such 
collaboration between universities and industries should be 
accompanied by proper disclosure and procedural safeguards 
noble criticized mits industrial liaison program in which he 
said firms pay a membership fee to the institution and gain access 
to research publications and other information 
he told the subcommittee that nearly all the member 
corporations of the ilp were multinationals with no necessary 
allegiance to the united states that fully half of them were 
foreign that 57 of them were major japanese competitors and that 
the ilp had for nearly a decade been operating an overseas sales 
office in downtown tokyo 
paul e gray president of mit told the panel that the 
institution would not operate this program were its only benefit a 
stream of revenue 
the educational and research functions of this sciencebased 
university require broadlybased understanding of industrial 
practice and industrial needsgray said the ilp is an important 
vehicle for developing that understanding and this is its principal 
benefit to the institute 
patricia k woolf of the woodrow wilson school at princeton 
university agreed that such arrangements can be beneficial but said 
the subject needs further study 
dr david blumenthal senior vice president of brigham and 
womens hospital in boston said that academic research 
institutions must insist on disclosure of relationships with 
industry that may create economic conflicts of interest 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the human resources 
subcommittee of the house government operations committee said i 
am sure that many americans will be justifiably outraged by some of 
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold or 
manipulated for personal gain 
rep larkin smith of mississippi the ranking republican on the 
panel said congress should send a strong signal to the research 
community that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated 
at the same time he said a careful balance must be struck 
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific 
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions we should not 
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way 
of overall progress

president najib said tuesday it is time 
for the backers of afghanistans anticommunist rebels america and 
pakistan to prove their sincerity and offer specific proposals for 
ending the civil war 
we ask the united states to consider the realities in 
afghanistan and aim for a peaceful settlement and restoration of 
peace he said in an interview with the associated press at his 
office near the presidential palace 
we believe that not only american public opinion but 
international opinion will demand this because the atrocities by the 
opposition inside afghanistan are against the humanitarian 
principles of the united states he said 
the 43yearold president spoke of his marxist governments 
efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the war and us and 
pakistani policies 
president bush and prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan 
agreed during their meetings in washington last week to search for a 
political settlement to the afghan conflict 
the revolt began after leftist officers seized power in 1978 and 
tried to impose marxism in this predominantly moslem country at 
least 13 million people have been killed in the war and about 5 
million afhans a third of the population have sought refuges in 
neighboring pakistan and iran 
bush and ms bhutto also agreed however that the united states 
should continue providing weapons to the rebels and seek an end to 
najibs rule 
it is too early to determine whether they are serious and 
sincere najib said of the two leaders 
how can one talk about a political settlement and reject one 
side in the conflict the government of afghanistan he asked 
rendering military assistance to the armed opposition means 
nothing but continuing war rendering military assistance to those 
who openly refuse a political settlement actually means continuing 
war and bloodshed and therefore preventing a political settlement 
the guerrillas refuse to negotiate with najib but their campaign 
to topple his government has stalled there are doubts within the 
us administration that the fractious rebel alliance based in 
pakistan will succeed 
pakistani officials have said the guerrillas could negotiate with 
the kabul government if najib and prominent members of the governing 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan were removed from power 
they also expressed hope the united states can press moscow to drop 
its insistence that the party be part of any future government 
najib a physician was tapped by the soviets in may 1986 to 
replace babrak karmal and then was elected president in november 
1987 by the grand national assembly the highest governing body in 
afghanistan 
he has said he would step down if that would guarantee peace in 
his wardevastated country 
after the last soviet troops left afghanistan on feb 15 many in 
the west predicted the government would collapse within weeks or 
months the guerrillas switched from hitandrun tactics and 
launched a frontal assault on the eastern city of jalalabad in early 
march and later offensives on the southern cities of khost and 
kandahar 
but the afghan armed forces held their ground bolstering the 
governments confidence 
how do we look weak or strong najib asked speaking through 
an interpreter they havent had a single military victory how 
should we feel 
with his troops able to stand alone najib has stepped up calls 
for a ceasefire peace talks and formation of a coalition 
government to be followed by election of a new government 
he has appealed to some guerrilla field commanders and their 
fighters to accept a truce major commanders rejected his offer but 
najib said about 60000 guerrillas agreed to stop fighting and 
negotiations were continuing continued 
the soviets intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 and sent 
more than 100000 military personnel into the country to help the 
government 
najib directed many of his remarks toward washington 
children are being killed in cold blood is that what mr 
bush would want for the american children everyday hundreds of 
women are grieving over the loss of their loved ones is that what 
mr bush would want for american women he said 
does the united states want fundamentalists extremists and 
terrorists or a government based on democratic principles 
nonaligned and neutral hasnt the united states tasted the bitter 
pill of extremism he asked possibly referring to irans 
fundamentalist islamic government does it want another one in 
afghanistan 
najib said our position is crystal clear the only practical 
and realistic solution for the cessation of war between all sides is 
to sit around a negotiating table and form a colaition government

the organization of american states is 
blind for not recognizing the opposition victory in the may 7 
elections presidential candidate guillermo endara said tuesday 
he spoke with reporters after talks with a fourman oas team 
seeking to resolve panamas political crisis that deepened when the 
government anulled the may elections 
the oas delegation is trying to arrange negotioations between the 
opposition headed by endara and the government controlled by gen 
manuel antonio noriega commander of the defense forces 
prospects appear dim noriega had rejected talks and the 
opposition insists the only solution is noriegas resignation a 
recognition of its electoral victory 
the way out of the crisis is what the people did on may 7 
said endara who was beaten up by noriega supporters after the 
elections international observers said the opposition had a winning 
margin of 31 in the balloting 
the oas is blind they dont understand the panamanian 
people endara said they must understand the people stop 
pressuring them and tell them that what they said on may 7 is what 
matters 
the oas group on its second trip to panama met tuesday with 
legislative leaders 
celso carrizo the pronoriega leader of panamas national 
assembly said he told the oas diplomats they first should tackle 
the issue of the us role in his country 
noriega and his supporters blame the crisis on washington which 
they accuse of wanting to renege on 1977 treaties ceding the panama 
canal to local control at the end of the century 
washington supports attempts to oust noriega who has been 
indicted in the united states on drug trafficking charges the 
panamanian leader denies the charges

chile has asked the united states to detain 
sergio buschmann wanted in connection with an attempt to 
assassinate president augusto pinochet until an extradition request 
can be filed a state department official said tuesday 
department spokeswoman nancy beck said buschmann an actor turned

australia 
this is a legal and diplomatic matter which is being studied by 
both us and chilean governments ms beck said adding that 
the united states wants justice to be served in this matter

contreras and another chilean is wanted in the united states in 
connection with the assassination in washington of orlando letelier

letelier was killed by a remotecontrolled bomb planted in his 
car in september 1976 riding in the car with him and also killed 
was an american assistant ronni moffitt 
capt armando fernandez larios who surrendered to us 
authorities out of remorse for his participation in the letelier 
assassination said contreras masterminded the plot 
buschmann is wanted in chile in connection with the sept 7 
1986 attempt to kill pinochet 
he has said in news conferences since his escape that he played a 
key role in the smuggling of a huge guerrilla arms cache into chile 
in 1986 
buschmann has been a spokesman for the manuel rodriguez patriotic 
front chiles principal leftist guerrilla group two years ago he 
escaped from a prison in chile where he faced armssmuggling 
charges 
he has been granted residence and politicalexile status in 
sweden but he was visiting australia when the chileans were seeking 
his extradition 
rather than extradite buschmann australia deported him last 
saturday australian authorities accused him of unacceptable 
activities he was raising funds for the guerrilla group and

a department of veterans affairs study released 
tuesday reports significantly elevated death rates for patients 
at 44 veterans hospitals and likely quality of care problems at 
22 of the medical centers 
the study based on a detailed analysis of selected cases said 
the quality of care problems were most pronounced at hospitals in 
tuskegee ala and battle creek mich 
in the tuskegee center the report said that three of 12 cases 
25 percent of those studied were judged to have likely quality of 
care problems at battle creek likely problems were found in 12 
of 59 cases or about 20 percent 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski ordered the report 
released but said in a letter to congress that the report did not 
represent a particularly effective use of va resources 
he said the report carries the qualifying note that no general 
statement about the quality of care within veterans affairs can be 
drawn from these findings 
nonetheless derwinski said we must try to do better 
he said the department must conduct a more extensive review so 
that the american public and especially our veterans have confidence 
in what we do independent oversight is essential to the 
credibility of va 
the report was initiated two years ago when the hospitals were 
operated by the veterans administration the va was elevated to the 
cabinetlevel department of veterans affairs in march when 
derwinski was sworn in 
a statement by the department said that the mortality study of 
veterans hospitals was initiated in 1987 after a separate federal 
study was conducted of mortality rates at community hospitals 
treating medicare patients 
officials determined that a similar study within the va system 
might be a useful adjunct to new quality assurance intitiatives the 
agency was undertaking the statement said but differences in 
vas methodology meant its results cannot be compared with data 
on community hospitals 
bill smith a spokesman for the veterans of foreign wars said in 
washington that the mortality figures reflect cutbacks in funds 
allocated for the hospitals 
the va has had to limit care to those who are the neediest the 
sickest he said this may account for the higher mortality 
rate 
the new mortality report is based on a review of 1771 deaths in 
1986 among patients at the 172 vterans hospitals around the country 
records for the dead patients were reviewed by several levels of 
evaluators and judged against a scale of predicted death based on 
several factors such as patient age condition nature of the 
illness and type of care 
from this study the report concludes that 44 medical centers had 
significantly elevated mortality rates for at least one of four 
patient categories fifteen of the veterans medical centers were 
judged to have mortality rates lower than expected 
evaluators ordered 123 of the 1771 cases to be reviewed by a 
group of doctors not associated with the hospitals a system called 
peer review 
of the 123 cases examined in detail two groups of peer reviewers 
found 90 cases at 22 centers in which the care given was not 
consistent with current medical practice 
the agreement of two peer reviewers on these 90 cases makes it 
appropriate to describe them as having likely quality of care 
problems the report said 
the hospitals with higherthanpredicted death rates are in these 
cities 
albany ny alexandria la asheville nc atlanta battle

disturbed two national endowment for the arts 
grants were used for morally reprehensible trash rep dick 
armey said tuesday he would seek to slash nea funding unless it 
adopts guidelines that end this horrible abuse of tax dollars 
the texas republican said he has collected the signatures of 107 
house members protesting the use of tax money on projects they deem 
inappropriate because of sexual or moral content 
armey said he met tuesday with hugh southern acting chairman of 
the nea to discuss guidelines for grant recipients that clearly 
pay respect to public standards of taste and decency 
armey also wants the agency to consider a potential recipients 
past work when handing out grants also at the meeting with southern 
were reps sid yates dill chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on interior and john murtha dpa a member of the 
panel 
southern said late tuesday that he believes the nea can craft 
something thats agreeable to all parties that doesnt get into 
any kind of chilling of expression 
southern said the peer panels that review grant applications and 
make recommendations to the national council of the arts which 
advises the nea in general do a very good job of advising us on 
very rare occasions they may recommend something that may be 
offensive to some people 
but the nea cannot absolutely guarantee none of our grants go 
to exhibits or works that do not offend anyone southern said 
armey said that while he welcomed southerns promise we have 
had verbal assurances in the past and theyve done no good 
the first nea grant that prompted the protest was to artist 
andres serrano who received 15000 in 1987 and created a picture 
of the crucifix which he submerged in a jar of urine 
the second was a 30000 award last year to support a national 
tour of a 150piece photographic retrospective called robert 
mapplethorpe the perfect moment 
armey complained in his letter to southern that the exhibit 
includes nude photographs of children homoerotic shots of men and 
a sadomasochistic selfportrait of the artist and other morally 
repugnant materials of a sexual nature 
the corcoran gallery of art on monday canceled its planned 
exhibit of the photographs because of concerns it would become 
embroiled in a battle over federal arts funding according to 
gallery officials 
the corcorans withdrawal from the exhibits tour is not a 
comment on the quality of the artists work neither is it an 
abrogation of the artists right of free expression nor does it 
question the endowments award system said gallery director 
christina orrcahall 
armey wrote in his letter we realize that the interpretation 
of art is a subjective evaluation but there is a very clear and 
unambiguous line that exists between what can be classified as art 
and what must be called morally reprehensible trash 
if nea fails to make progress in writing the new guidelines when 
congress considers next years budget later this year armey said he 
would consider cutting the agencys funding if the guidelines 
arent in place by next year he threatened even tougher cuts in the 
following years budget 
the graphic evidence is there id win those votes armey said

vice president dan quayle on 
tuesday asked rightist political leader robert daubuisson a man 
long linked to death squads not to embarrass the new government and 
urged leftist politicians to cut ties with guerrillas quayles 
spokesman said 
quayle met separately in san salvador with the newly inaugurated 
president alfredo cristiani of the arena party founded by 
daubuisson and various political and military leaders 
quayle pulled daubuisson aside said press secretary david 
beckwith and told him dont embarrass cristiani 
he meant dont do anything to cause problems for the 
administration beckwith said adding that daubuisson nodded in 
response 
its pretty obvious quayle was referring to the reputed ties 
of daubuisson and the political party he founded and rightwing 
death squads believed responsible for thousands of deaths over the 
past decade 
in light of the recent assassination of cristianis top cabinet 
adviser beckwith said there are concerns that rightists might try 
to retaliate 
quayles been pretty solid that nothing of that sort should be 
done beckwith told reporters traveling with quayle as the vice 
president flew from san salvador to san jose costa rica to 
conclude a threeday swing through central america which he has 
called a mission of peace and democracy 
quayle also met with leftist leaders guillermo ungo and ruben 
zamora who are closely allied with the guerrillas and told them 
the rebels should lay down their arms 
they refused beckwith said 
the vice president congratulated them for joining the democratic 
election process and urged them to cut their ties to the farabundo 
marti national liberation front or fmln the guerrilla organization 
according to beckwith the two leaders admitted that the fmln had 
been responsible for the recent assassination of el salvadors 
attorney general roberto garcia alvadora also an arena member and 
they suspected the fmln was responsible for last fridays shotgun 
slaying of cabinet adviser jose rodriguez porth 
however the two leftists declined to sever relations with the 
fmln stating that it represents a significant proportion of 
salvadorans 
in all his conversations quayle underscored the need to respect 
human rights 
critics in congress contend that even though cristiani has 
pledged support for human rights he is merely a front man for 
extremists who advocate use of torture illegal detention and death 
squad killings in the decadeold fight against guerrillas 
quayle flew to costa rica to end his trip by meeting with 
president oscar arias the two were to discuss nicaragua and the 
regional peace plan arias authored as well as us concerns about 
the continuation in office of panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
earlier tuesday quayle said it seems unlikely the contras will 
return to live peacefully in nicaragua but after meeting with their 
leaders he vowed continued us support for them 
quayle also accused nicaragua of trying to kill democracy in 
neighboring el salvador by arming the leftist rebel movement 
quayle met with contra military leader enrique bermudez and three 
top field commanders in tegucigalpa honduras before flying to el 
salvador on the second day of his threeday central american trip 
he told reporters he informed the contras he did not know what 
congress would do in terms of renewing military aid if the 
nicaraguan elections next february are rigged 
however i said to them we continue to have and will always 
have a moral obligation to the resistance he added 
but until i know whats going to happen between now and the 
election and how that election is going to go i cant get more 
specific than that he said 
the bush administration is backing a regional diplomatic approach 
to solve the nicaraguan war and supplying nonlethal aid to the 
11000member contra army until the elections are concluded 
us officials have held out the possibility of renewed military 
aid if nicaraguas leftist sandinista government does not hold a 
fair election 
but quayle and other officials acknowledge there is little 
sentiment in congress for such a move 
quayle also visited rodriguez widow and later told a news 
conference that type of violence was perpetrated by the fmln and 
the leftist guerrillas cannot be tolerated 
the rodriguez house in a luxurious neighborhood where 
securityconscious residents live in walled compounds was adorned 
with a black ribbon and a sign reading we are in mourning and we 
reject terrorism 
bloodstains were visible on the driveway as soldiers cordoned off 
the street and dozens of us secret service agents stood at thle also 
viewed ult rifles antitank rockets and other 
weapons the salvadoran military said it captured from the rebels 
quayles staff released a state department statement saying the 
weaponry was of eastbloc and cuban manufacture and blamed havana 
and nicaragua as the principal facilitators of arms shipments to the 
rebels 
the administration accuses the sandinistaating the 
regional esquipulas ii peace accords ban on export of revolution 
in light of that quayle said he is skeptical that the sandinistas 
will live up to their fairelection promise 
quayle said the contra commanders he saw whose noms de guerre 
were franklin vlos and ganso indicated they would not return 
peacefully to nicaragua because they feared for their safety 
the vice president said he did not urge the contras to return 
home but encouraged them to try to use the political process that 
is available to them 
but the commanders told him it would be a miracle tsee a 
fair nicaragua election quayle said 
he said the contras promised they were honoring the ban on 
military attacks that is a condition of the 49 million in us aid 
congress has allotted them until the election

a malpractice lawsuit accuses two doctors of 
failing to tell a man he had tested positive for aids and the 
plaintiffs lawyer said tuesday the lawsuit is one of the first of 
its kind in the country 
s michael long a former tire salesman who is divorced said he 
had sex with at least 14 women without using a condom before he 
learned last august that he had the disease 
if i knew then what i know now i would have been abstinent 
long said i would never dream of passing ths virus on 
kenneth e labowitz an alexandria attorney who represents long 
said there have not been very many aidsrelated malpractice cases 
there are about a dozen nationwide and most of them have to do 
with oddly enough false positives people who have been told that 
they did have aids when they did not he said 
long 39 says he requested the test for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in february 1987 while he was being treated for 
kidney stones at roanokes community hospital because he had been 
given blood transfusions in 1980 
long said michael j basile the internist who ordered the aids 
test told him he would contact him if it was positive and edgar b 
cutter the urologist who admitted him to the hospital knew the 
test had been performed 
long alleges he never heard from either doctor 
in court papers filed last month basile denied all allegations 
of negligence but acknowledged ordering the hiv test without 
providing counseling for long 
john jessee an attorney for cutter said his client denies 
that he was negligent or that anything he did harmed mr long in any 
way 
labowitz said long learned he had contracted aids apparently 
from the transfusions when he was admitted with symptoms of the 
disease including swollen glands and lethargy 
the lawyer said long is taking medication and his aids symptoms 
come and go hes healthier now than he has been he said 
long contends that the doctors failure to tell him the test 
result kept him from getting treatment that could prolong his life 
its a myth that aids is untreatable and theres nothing you 
can do labowitz said 
labowitz said long has told the women and his former wife that he 
has aids the lawyer said the women also might have grounds for a 
lawsuit

the national congress on soviet jewry voted 
tuesday to support trade concessions to the soviet union if 
president bush receives assurances that positive soviet emigration 
trends will continue 
the atmosphere is improving but there is much yet to be 
done said shoshana s cardin the chairman of the congress 
there are still major impediments to emigration 
the board of governors of the congress which represents 47 
jewish organizations around the country voted 483 with one 
abstention to endorse a 12month waiver of jacksonvannik amendment 
restrictions contingent on bush receiving assurances from the 
kremlin 
although the language of the resolution was mild it was 
significant because the national conference on soviet jewry is a 
major interest group monitoring emigration from the soviet union 
the jacksonvanik amendment passed by congress in 1974 under the 
sponsorship of the late sen henry jackson dwash and rep 
charles vanik dohio now retired requires the kremlin to allow a 
certain number of jews to emigrate each year in return for 
mostfavorednation status under which soviet exports are subject 
to reduced tariffs in the united states 
the legislation does not spell out levels of emigration but 
allows the president some leeway in determining what is acceptable 
soviet leaders have bridled at the law which they consider 
interference in their domestic affairs 
ms cardin predicted at a news conference that jewish emigration 
from the soviet union could reach 54000 this year up from 18965 
last year the previous high level was 51320 in 1979 and the low 
since congress passed the jacksonvanik amendment was 896 in 1984 
the resolution passed tuesday said that the soviet reform 
process is in a selfdescribed state of definition and 
experimentation the ussr today is suspended between the 
oppression of its past and the promise of the future the extension 
of new freedoms and democratic reforms coexist with old patterns of 
behavior and authority 
it said that the organization was prepared to support a waiver 
of the jacksonvanik amendment if the president receives 
assurances on four points that current levels of emigration will be 
maintained that those seeking to emigrate not be blocked because 
they had access to alleged state secrets that the cases of 
longterm refuseniks be resolved and that soviet authorities ease 
restrictions on socalled poor relatives 
ms cardin who is from baltimore said that her group knew of 
200 families being denied permission to emigrate because they were 
poor relatives requiring signed statements from kin that they 
have no outstanding financial obligations 
she said that some 400000 invitations have been mailed to soviet 
jews to leave the soviet union but that not all of those people had 
filed for permission to emigrate under soviet law those seeking a 
visa to emigrate must have permission from a relative in the country 
where they are seeking to travel 
ms cardin went to moscow in may and said she was told by soviet 
officials that they were drafting legislation that would ease 
emigration in part by not requiring the invitations to be sent by 
relatives she said there was no guarantee when the law would be 
passed

former state attorney general j marshall 
coleman narrowly defeated former us sen paul s trible jr on 
tuesday in virginias first republican primary for governor in 40 
years 
coleman will oppose democrat l douglas wilder who is trying to 
become the first elected black governor of a us state coleman 
lost in a previous bid for governor in 1981 
with 2006 of the states 2008 precincts reporting in unofficial 
returns coleman had 147538 votes to 139967 for trible or 37 
percent to 35 percent us rep stanford e parris trailed with 
112111 votes or 28 percent 
a joyous coleman appeared before his supporters at 940 pm 
saying with your work and commitment were going to take back 
the statehouse in 1990 
coleman said he appreciated the warmth and graciousness and 
eloquence of my two worthy adversaries these two men were the 
toughest adversaries a person could have 
trible who had been favored in the primary conceded at 925 pm 
ive always believed in the fundamental fairness and wisdom of 
the people of virginia trible told supporters in downtown 
richmond tonight in their wisdom the people of virginia have 
chosen another marshall coleman 
the primary generated little public interest despite 10 million 
in campaign spending voter turnout approached 400000 much greater 
than the 235000 turnout for the gops super tuesday presidential 
primary last year 
none of the candidates played up the racial aspect of a possible 
victory by wilder the 58yearold democratic lieutenant governor 
by contrast charges of racism marked a mayoral campaign that 
culminated tuesday in jersey city nj where city council 
president glenn cunningham lost a bid to become the citys first 
black mayor 
former mayor gerald mccann defeated cunningham by a margin of 
30169 to 24249 turnout was extremely light 
mccann 39 denied in the campaign that his supporters showed 
white voters a 1970s photograph of cunningham wearing his hair in an 
afro style cunningham now a 43yearold police captain was 
accused of attack advertising for trying during his campaign to 
portray mccann a wealthy accountant as antitenant and 
prodeveloper

leaving the senate last year after one term rather than taking on 
democrat charles s robb a popular former governor who won a 
landslide 
coleman 47 was branded by his opponents as a loser for his 1981 
defeat in the gubernatorial race against robb and his inability in 
1985 to win the nomination for lieutenant governor 
parris 59 was attacked as a regional candidate whose interest 
was limited to northern virginia and his opposition to statehood for 
washington dc

why do actors act singers sing or comedians 
crack jokes 
showing off is the answer reiterated by four performers in 
the title song of a chirpy cheery little musical revue now playing 
at a west side cabaret room called steve mcgraws they call this 
selfabsorption art for artists sake 
musical revues are an endangered species in new york these days 
and good ones are near extinction the longrunning and 
foreverchanging forbidden broadway cornered the market on 
spoofs of broadway musicals showing off written by douglas 
bernstein and denis markell takes a much wider aim and more often 
than not scores a bullseye 
its best songs are sly satiric numbers with just a touch of 
spite that capture the intense peculiarities of big city residents 
in one bernstein and markell poke fun at sip self important 
people you know the folks that work in theater box offices 
maitres d at fancy french restaurants auto mechanics or telephone 
receptionists whose first words are hold please 
in another bernstein who appears in the show with veanne cox 
donna murphy and mark sawyer plays the showbiz rabbi he leads the

bernstein is a sleepy bear of a man with a lazy laidback charm 
sawyer suggests a worldweary yuppie who lost it all in the stock 
market crash miss cox is a sexy olive oyl crossed with a kewpie 
doll while miss murphy smolders with a smoky voice and a deadly 
funny deadpan manner 
showing off demands a little intelligence from its audience 
it helps going into the show to know something about such diverse 
subjects as eudora welty blue velvet eraserhead and 
michele marsh an anchorwoman for the cbs affiliate in new york 
director michael leeds doesnt allow the pace to sag during the 
75minute show moving performers on and off the small stage with 
rapidfire precision pianist stephen flaherty provides strong 
unobtrusive support the hallmark of a fine musician 
showing off proves that such musical entertainments as the 
revue can be resusciated but it takes a special kind of writing and 
performance to make it consistently appealing this lively and 
literate show doesnt falter during its parade of funny business

the state parole board decided tuesday 
that the deranged fan who knifed theresa saldana in 1982 wont be 
released until march but the actress said she cant understand why 
he would ever be freed 
arthur jackson earlier given a goodbehavior parole date of 
thursday that had halved his 12year sentence for attempted murder 
must now serve an additional 270 days for breaking prison windows 
and refusing to obey orders california parole officials decided 
his pending release had spurred moves in the state legislature to 
lengthen the sentence for seconddegree murder and brought an 
outraged response from los angeles city officials 
new charges filed in los angeles last week accuse jackson of 
sending threatening letters from his prison cell but the board 
didnt rescind the goodtime credits allowing jackson an early 
release 
jackson a 53yearold scottish drifter attacked the actress 
from raging bull outside her west hollywood apartment and 
stabbed her 10 times with a kitchen knife 
i am temporarily relieved and im glad we can have the baby and 
not be worried about a release date around the time of my baby due 
date i will be able to have my baby in peace said the actress 
who is 6 months pregnant 
but she expressed dismay that jackson could eventually be freed 
its very confusing everyone tells me just have him 
committed everyone feels that will be the solution 
jackson attorney richard shore of sacramento said he may appeal 
the decision handed down after a closed disciplinary hearing by the 
board of prison terms at the california medical facility in 
vacaville 
the prisons chief psychiatrist v meenakshi told reporters 
afterward that jackson has been diagnosed a chronic paranoid 
schizophrenic who lives in his own world 
if you look at it in the way the courts look at it legally 
then no hes not dangerous in legal terms she said to people 
he is involved with in his delusional mind he is dangerous 
jacksons new parole date is march 15 1990 the board also added 
two conditions of parole he cannot contact the actress and cannot 
return to los angeles county without written approval 
last week los angeles prosecutors filed eight felony counts 
against jackson for allegedly making death threats against miss 
saldana los angeles district attorney ira reiner wanted the board 
to enforce the jacksons full 12year sentence 
jackson could face eight more years in prison and possible 
deportation if convicted on the latest charges 
our objective quite simply is to keep him off the street 
reiner said

the british museum placed the portland vase in a 
guarded bulletproof display case tuesday a year after the 
2000yearold roman treasure was deliberately smashed again and 
reassembled with modern glue 
the vase estimated to be worth 18 million had been broken two 
times before and was restored a third time because the glue holding 
it together had become yellow and brittle 
nigel williams the museums chief conservator of ceramics said 
the blue and white cameoglass vase now at last is restored to its 
former glory 
he said the latest epoxy resins were used in the restoration 
in 1845 william lloyd who had been drinking heavily for a week 
smashed the vase into about 200 pieces with his walking stick when 
it was displayed at the museum lloyd an irishman had a grudge 
against relatives of then prime minister the duke of portland 
whose family had owned the vase since 1785 
it was stuck together by the british museums craftsmen and put 
on display but the glue became so weak and discolored that in 1948 
it was dismantled and rebuilt last year it was broken again and 
reassembled 
the vase was made by the sculptor dioscourides and depicts men 
and women in a leafy setting probably the courtship of peleus and 
the sea goddess thetis who became the parents of the mythical greek 
warrior achilles 
it was discovered in 1582 in a tomb near rome and is believed to 
have belonged to the emperor augustus

the house responding to a drugdriven record 
murder rate in the nations capital voted tuesday to spend 127 
million to hire 700 additional district of columbia police officers 
the bill which passed by a 289104 margin authorizes spending 
the money over five years to bring extra force to a police 
department that now has slightly more than 3900 members 
this bill will bring peace and stability to neighborhoods that 
have erupted in an outbreak of drugrelated violence said del 
walter fauntroy ddc chief sponsor the measure 
the measure is awaiting action in the senate congress would 
still have to appropriate the money each year to allow it to be 
spent 
through tuesday 202 people had been killed in the district so 
far in 1989 compared to 133 at the same time last year a record 
372 persons were killed in washington in 1988 and police blamed 
more than 60 percent of these killings on drugs 
although opponents said the bill would be a costly special 
special stipend for one city backers won with arguments that 
congress has ultimate responsibility for safety in the nations 
capital 
i find it almost uncanny that members can on the one hand begin 
to be seriously concerned about the health and safety of residents 
of the district of columbia but when we begin to address that 
issue the issue suddenly becomes numbers said rep ron dellums 
dcalif chairman of the district of columbia committee 
the bill also directs the city to begin construction on a new 
800bed prison and drug treatment facility in southeast washington 
and establish a community relations plan by assigning the officers 
to regular neighborhood beats 
the measure also stipulates that all assets seized in drug raids 
be turned over to the police department for use in antidrug 
programs 
mayor marion barry whose contacts with a convicted drug dealer 
are the subject of a federal grand jury probe and criticism on 
capitol hill said the house action demonstrates that the city still 
has a good rapport with congress 
we are very pleased with the outcome barry said it shows 
that our relationship with the hill is still intact 
congress is also considering a proposal to assign officers from 
federal police agencies to the city police department while the 700 
additional officers are recruited and trained

us district judge robert aguilar was 
indicted tuesday on charges that he illegally aided felons making 
him the first federal judge charged with violating us racketeering 
laws 
also indicted by the federal grand jury were abe the trigger 
chapman a selfstyled former mafia hitman and longtime acquaintance 
of aguilars and rudy tham a convicted embezzler for whom aguilar 
allegedly interceded 
if convicted of all charges in the eightcount indictment 
aguilar 58 could be sentenced to 55 years in prison and fined 2 
million 
the indictment obtained by the justice department accuses aguilar 
of going to other federal judges and trying to get favorable 
treatment for tham and another felon ronald cloud a nevada casino 
owner who was convicted of bank fraud aguilar has disclosed in 
financial statements that he accepted an interestfree lifetime 
12000 loan from cloud 
the judge is also accused of tipping off chapman about a federal 
wiretap order advising one of chapmans lawyers to lie to the grand 
jury about aguilars activities making false statements to the fbi 
and helping his former secretary attorney vera hoff while she was 
a fugitive in mexico where she fled after a tax conviction 
aguilar a 1980 appointee of president jimmy carter is the first 
federal judge charged with racketeering and the fourth to be accused 
of crimes in the last decade 
unlike most cases brought under the federal racketeering law 
aguilar is not accused of benefiting financially from his 
activities instead the indictment contends the judge used his 
89500ayear job as a racketeering enterprise in multiple acts 
of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct impede and influence the 
due administration of justice 
aguilar declined to talk to reporters who went to his home in 
campbell near san jose after the indictment and attempts by the 
associated press to obtain his telephone number were unsuccessful 
talking to reporters before the longexpected indictment patrick 
hallinan a lawyer for aguilar called the accusations hogwash 
and contended the judge was being targeted as a minority liberal who 
has issued several important rulings against the government 
federal prosecutors sought the indictment because they dont 
like the viewpoint of one judge hallinan said 
the indictment was issued after mrs hoff who was arrested in 
march agreed to testify against aguilar in a plea bargain with the 
government 
aguilars former secretary broke down in tears while testifying 
tuesday afternoon said her attorney randy sue pollack 
mrs hoff was promised no additional time for absconding and a 
parole hearing in september regarding her twoyear prison sentence 
her lawyer said 
violations of a federal law called the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act or rico are punishable by up to 20 years 
in prison 
hallinan said aguilar has arranged to turn himself in on july 12 
or 13 he said he has asked the judge to take a leave from his job 
in the san jose federal court while the charges are pending though 
not to resign from office a federal judge can be removed only 
through impeachment by congress 
us district judge harry claiborne of nevada became the first 
judge this century to be impeached in 1986 two years after he was 
convicted of income tax evasion 
impeachment is pending against two other federal judges alcee 
hastings of florida over allegations stemming from his acquittal on 
bribery charges and walter nixon of mississippi who was convicted 
of perjury 
the rico law passed in 1970 prohibits conducting an 
enterprise in a pattern of criminal activity consisting of at 
least two specified crimes in a 10year period the crimes range 
from murder and kidnapping to mail fraud obstruction of justice and 
interference with criminal investigations 
the law was aimed at fighting organized crime but has been 
interpreted broadly to apply to a variety of ongoing criminal 
activity including the misuse of a government position such as 
police officer or state judge for personal benefit

the senate finance committee approved 
groundbreaking legislation tuesday that would give a new tax credit 
of up to 500 a year to lowincome working americans to help them 
buy health insurance for their children 
the provision was part of a larger measure crafted by committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas that also would enable the working 
poor to take fuller advantage of tax credits for child care already 
available to everyone 
democratic leaders are contemplating having the measure debated 
this week on the senate floor it is certain to produce sparks not 
only because of the innovative new health tax credit but also 
because it takes a more modest approach to child care benefits than 
another major democratic initiative yet differs significantly from 
yet another child care program proposed by president bush 
the 173 vote by which the measure cleared committee was not a 
true measure of its overall support even among committee members 
several republicans who voted for it said they had serious 
reservations and were acting largely to spur consideration of child 
care legislation 
i know there is going to be a big battle with the abc bill on 
the floor said sen robert dole rkan a committee member and 
the senate gop leader maybe well end up without any child care 
bill at all 
doles reference to the abc bill was to a measure by sen 
chris dodd dconn that envisions a much more expensive child care 
program and one that generates additional controversy because it 
would impose national standards on daycare providers 
the bentsen legislation aims at providing about 105 billion in 
additional benefits over a fiveyear period without increasing the 
federal budget deficit it would raise the money by keeping the 
existing 3 percent telephone excise tax in place indefinitely rather 
than allowing it to expire after dec 31 1990 under current law 
the measure also would delay for one year the imposition of 
socalled section 89 of the tax code governing tax deductions for 
employerpaid health insurance and simplify the rules once they do 
take effect 
although having little direct impact on individuals the section 
89 provisions have generated a huge outcry from businesses 
complaining largely about the complexity of compliance 
the rules are intended to discourage richer health insurance 
policies for executives than for rankandfile workers by 
prohibiting bigger tax breaks for such executive plans 
the new rules would simply recordkeeping procedures and clarify 
eligibility tests for what would constitute impermissibly subsidized 
policies 
although some members expressed skepticism that the health 
insurance tax credit would help much bentsen said he was encouraged 
by testimony before the finance committee on monday by a blue cross 
vice president who predicted the insurance industry would develop 
policies aimed directly at children if a new federal subsidy is made 
available to help pay for them 
he said such policies are already available in california for 
about 250 a year per child 
the new tax credit would be up to 50 percent of the cost of a 
policy up to 1000 resulting in a maximum of 500 for a family 
with 12000 or less income the percentage decreases steadily until 
the credit would not be available for a family with more than 
21000 income 
the policy would have to cover at least one dependent child under 
age 19 but also could cover other family members including adults 
here were trying to get at the working poor bentsen said 
the health tax credit would be refundable that is a family 
that qualifies for the tax credit but does not make enough money to 
have to pay income tax would get the benefit in the form of a cash 
grant 
bentsens package also makes an existing tax credit refundable so 
poorer americans would be able to claim the same benefit even if 
they do not incur an income tax liability 
the current credit is up to 30 percent for child care costs up to 
4800 for a household with two or more eligible children or 2400 
for one child 
the 30 percent credit is available only to households with income 
below 10000 and falls by 1 percentage point for each 2000 of 
adjusted gross income between 10000 and 28000 above 28000 
the maximum credit is 20 percent 
in addition to making the credit refundable the bentsen bill 
would increase the credit to 32 percent for taxpayers with income 
between 8000 and 10000 a year and to 34 percent for those making 
below 8000 a year

twin earthquakes that shook los angeles did 
little harm but they scared people and highlighted the danger from 
recently discovered faults concealed deep beneath the nations 
secondlargest city 
the temblors however suggest the danger may be more likely to 
come from a series of moderate quakes than from a muchfeared big 
one 
nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake 
any more than we did before said us geological survey 
seismologist lucile jones what happened today should make you 
feel a little more relieved 
the monday morning quakes injured one person and caused scattered 
minor damage downtown and in suburbs to the east including cracked 
plaster fallen ceiling tiles and broken windows

despite its unilateral cuts the soviet militarys 
overwhelming numbers still make it the worlds biggest war 
machine and dont back up kremlin claims about a switch to defensive 
strategy the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff said 
tuesday 
speaking candidly it is rather difficult for americans and 
those in many other countries to see how such a massive array of 
power is mandated by the legitimate needs of defense adm william 
j crowe jr told students and instructors at the voroshilov general 
staff military academy in moscow 
crowe on an 11day official visit to the soviet union also 
suggested that instead of announcing more unilateral reductions the 
kremlin join the united states in negotiating mutual cuts even of 
modest scale a step he said would best promote progress in arms 
control 
youd be surprised at the effect it would have and pave the 
way for more dramatic steps in the future crowe told his soviet

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and west german chancellor helmut kohl endorsed a joint strategy 
tuesday to heal the wounds of european division which they 
helped inflict half a century ago 
they assured the world their partnership poses no threat this 
time as it did when adolf hitler and josef stalin divided poland in 
their 1939 nonaggression pact 
both nations want a common european home in which the united 
states and canada have their place and all nations exist in 
peaceful competition with one another the joint declaration 
says 
a tidal wave of goodwill toward gorbachev on the second day of 
his state visit appeared to wash away fears rooted in the collusion 
of the dictators and the destruction of world war ii

that bob elliott always seemed like such a nice 
man 
remember the halcyon days of the elliott clan when all three 
networks would set up in the twoacre yard behind the hut the 
familys fabulous upper east side mansion better known nowadays as 
the metropolitan museum of art to cover those fairytale birthday 
parties that famous comedian bob elliott one half of bob and ray 
would throw for his youngest son chris who grew up to be 
semifamous as a regular on late night with david letterman 
did any of us realize that those were all bob elliotts friends 
did any of us really think a 6yearold would invite dick cavett to 
his birthday party or jerry vale or andy rooney and charles kuralt 
who wrestled shirtless for petes sake 
well it seems that after long years of painful selfexamination 
chris elliott has finally found the courage to write the book that 
explodes the myth daddys boy it makes mommie dearest 
and jackie rogers jrs damn you daddy dearest look like love 
letters 
what a shock to find out that bob elliott was so egomaniacal he 
named his sons bob jr 1 through 9 except the twins who were 5a 
and 5b chris the 10th son was even forced to wear a latex 
bald wig so he would look more like his father otto 
preminger chris heartless classmates called him 
how could i make people listen to me chris writes 
searchingly in his opening chapter how could i tell the story 
that so desperately needed telling and maybe make a few bucks in 
the process and then it hit me like a ton of bricks write a book 
 
but wait a second was i nuts did i really have enough 
complaints about growing up to fill a book i convinced myself that 
that didnt matter the only important thing was that i get my face 
on the cover 
what also mattered was the legal action bob elliott was sure to 
take when chris let him have it in the tellall book to assuage the 
legal eagles chris gamely offered his father a rebuttal to each 
chapter 
i dont know what chris is talking about bob complains in 
his rebuttal to chapter 1 of daddys boy delacorte press 
1295 chris doesnt have nine brothers he has three sisters 
and one brother we did not live in the metropolitan museum of art 
and i have never in my life had the pleasure of meeting mr jerry 
vale although i would not turn down such an opportunity if it 
presented itself do my lawyers actually think people are going to 
take this book seriously

bushs first 100 days on television media monitor a research 
publication of the center for media studies in washington says cbs 
was tougher on president george bush during his first 100 days in 
office than nbc or abc 
a study by the nonprofit media research group found bush 
received favorable personal evaluations but his policies were 
assessed positively only 39 percent of the time on cbs compared to 
63 percent favorable on nbc abc gave bush 85 percent positive 
evaluations according to the analysis 
whether negative or positive bush is getting less coverage than 
his predecessors according to the study he has drawn 37 percent 
fewer stories than ronald reagan did in 1981 and 45 percent fewer 
than jimmy carter in 1977 
more tales from some crypt cbs is reprising that fabulous cbs

bored by humdrum economic statistics like the 
unemployment rate housing starts and quarterly estimates of the 
seasonally adjusted annual growth rate of the real gross national 
product 
well the federal reserve has something new to spice up your 
study of economics the mysterious forces that help determine the 
size of your paycheck and make everything you want to buy too 
expensive 
its called pstar after the symbol p with an asterisk used 
in the mathematical equations by which it is computed 
the p stands for the level of prices everybody pays for goods and 
services the asterisk means roughly not the current level of 
prices but the naturallong term level where they would stand 
depending on the amount of money flowing through the economy 
in other words it is an experimental tool for measuring and 
managing future inflationary trends 
that makes it potentially important because the fed bases its 
decisions about whether to stimulate the economy by lowering 
interest rates or to slow it down by making credit more expensive 
largely on where it believes the inflation rate is headed 
traders in the financial markets also help to set interest rates 
by buying or selling bonds based on their inflation expectations and 
on what they believe the fed will do next 
so if the fed deems pstar significant and useful fedwatchers 
will watch it too and it someday could make a difference in whether 
you can afford a mortgage or how much interest you can get on a 
certificate of deposit 
alan greenspan the feds chairman described pstar several 
months ago in testimony before a congressional committee 
he said research by the central banks staff indicates that 
future changes in the rate of inflation have been fairly reliably 
linked to the difference between the prevailing price level p 
without a star and its equilibrium level pstar 
when actual prices stand below pstar the feds studies suggest 
inflation seems likely to increase at some point in the future 
when actual prices are above pstar conversely a slowing of 
inflation can be expected somewhere down the road 
calculated for recent threemonth periods actual prices have 
been below pstar suggesting increasing inflationary pressures but 
the gap has been narrowing and there is talk that the figures may 
soon point to lower rather than higher inflation in the future 
however private economists warn against putting too much weight 
on this nascent number 
first this is a longrun indicator and is not meant to be used 
for shortrun adjustments to monetary policy said darwin beck at 
the investment firm first boston corp 
second there is a long lag between when pstar points to a 
deceleration of inflation and when that deceleration begins to show 
up in actual price changes in most cases this lag is a year or more 
shortrun monetary policy will not be influenced by this 
indicator 
skeptics say the idea of pstar itself is questionable because 
the formula used to calculate it requires making some dubious 
assumptions giving stable values to some aspects of the economy 
that are inherently unstable and unpredictable 
its certainly too early to tell just what if any role this new 
analysis will have in the policy process said david resler chief 
economist at nomura securities international in new york 
if it is given prominence fed policymakers could find 
themselves exposed to criticism about the underlying assumptions 
that determine pstar

in the house interior committee hearing room 
hangs a portrait of chairman morris udall standing tall with his 
coat slung over his shoulder the longtime lawmaker former 
presidential candidate and wellknown humorist appears eager for a 
challenge 
but the man occupying the chairmans seat across the room no 
longer mirrors his portrait he sits stooped in his chair his hands 
quivering and his voice barely audible 
although physically ravaged by parkinsons disease udall 67 
years old today fends off calls for his retirement and still gets 
his message through clearly 
my replacement hasnt been born yet udall recently told rep 
ben nighthorse campbell dcolo who had the temerity to ask his 
fellow democrat whether hed been grooming anyone to take over the 
house seat from arizona hes held since 1960 
hes as tough as in the portrait says rep john rhodes 
rariz whose district neighbors udalls 
his mind is still very sharp said rep don young of alaska 
the committees ranking republican weve been fighting for 14 or 
15 years ive beat him two or three times but its very 
difficult 
udall who once played a year of pro basketball despite having a 
glass eye and unsuccessfully sought his partys presidential 
nomination in 1976 has taken the disease as a challenge and his 
staff says is fighting it with a sense of humor 
theres never been any doubt about that sense of humor 
one of the jokes aides like to repeat was used by udall back when 
news was circulating about paula parkinson a shapely lobbyist whose 
kissandtell habit had many members of congress nervous 
there are two kinds of parkinsons disease said udall 
both of them give you the shakes 
although udall a liberal says he doesnt use an iron hand to 
rule the committee which oversees government lands its easy to 
see that legislation he opposes doesnt stand a chance 
republicans stalked out of a committee session one day in may 
when their amendments to the udallsponsored american heritage trust 
act were defeated by democratic proxies held by udall 
my style is different he said in a recent interview he uses 
the merits to argue his position he said dryly pausing he 
said i jest 
then with the sagacity for which he is known udall defined 
power in washington as the ability for me to have you vote aye 
when you want to vote no 
it may be because of a favor from the past because you like me 
or because i gave time to the opposition he said 
udall was hospitalized last month to have his parkinsons 
medication adjusted and for treatment of pneumonia an old friend 
ben cole wrote a column for the arizona republic suggesting that 
udall retire 
it hurt him said cole former washington bureau chief for 
the republic retired and living in suburban virginia im sorry 
for that 
but cole said he sticks by his column you cant ask people to 
stay young forever he said adding that he fears people will 
start taking advantage of udall because of his health 
committee colleagues from both parties support udalls decision 
to stay 
we owe him said young even though we are adversaries on 
many issues and our philosophies are different i respect him 
very much 
another frequent adversary on the committee rep ron marlenee 
rmont said he would support mr udall for as long as he chooses 
to come to congress i have the greatest respect for him 
former arizona sen barry goldwater mentioned by cole as someone 
who knew when it was time to pass the burden to younger shoulders 
wrote udall after the column was published 
your fellow arizonans are sitting out here reading that 
everybody in the land of oz is urging you to step down and come 
home the republican said 
i hope to god you do what you want to do to hell with these 
advisors that want you to come back id love to have you in 
arizona with me but to be honest with you id rather have you 
in washington doing the things you do for our state 
when he was released from the hospital may 26 udalls doctors 
told him to rest for a week or two five days later he was back in 
his office 
he keeps very active which is very important said frank 
williams executive director of the american parkinson disease 
association of which udall is honorary chairman 
williams acknowledged that at times udall looks bad but said 
parkinsons patients have intact mental abilities 
they do not lose their faculties he said they watch their 
body deteriorate day after day 
williams said some people function for 25 to 30 years with the 
disease udall has battled it for about 10 he also suffers from 
arthritis said an aide which accounts for his stoop 
parkinsons is a neurological disorder that affects automatic 
movements forcing sufferers to concentrate on muscle reactions 
normal people have without thinking 
another symptom is loss of voice said williams 
despite that handicap udall speaks to other parkinsons patients 
at functions arranged by the association hes an inspiration 
because he hasnt given up said williams 
many dont want him to most bluntly goldwater gave udall this 
advice on detractors 
tell them to go to hell

a handsome obsessed young man in ascot and 
smoking jacket pensively paces the vast rooms of his ancestral 
manor as clouds scud across the moon on a brooding night 
he muses criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot so my 
disguise must be able to strike terror in their hearts must be 
a creature of the night black terrible 
crash the windows open and a huge bat flies into the room an 
omen thats it he exults i shall become a bat 
a halfcentury ago bruce wayne donned gray tights blueblack 
cape and bateared cowl to go forth in the dark of night in gotham 
city to fight crime as batman 
today as a 40 million movie he ranks with such great fictional 
detectives as sherlock holmes and the lone ranger 
he began 50 years ago in new york city superman had been 
around for a year eighteenyearold bob kane was asked by dc comics 
editor vincent sullivan to devise a new character to meet the demand 
for more superheroes 
i remember kane said in an interview when i was 12 or 13 
i was an ardent reader of books on how things began the 
automobile the steam engine the parachute and i came across a 
book about leonardo da vinci this had a picture of a flying machine 
with huge bat wings it looked like a bat man to me 
he also remembered the 1920 movie the mark of zorro starring 
douglas fairbanks sr during the day he was a bored count a 
philanthropist kane said but he became zorro at night he 
donned this mask and came out of a cave riding a black horse 
and there was a somber 1930 movie the bat whispers starring 
chester morris as a costumed villain who wore a fullface bat mask 
kane also was inspired by radio and pulp novel heroes such as 
wealthy manabouttown lamont cranston who by night became the 
shadow a grim avenger and news publisher britt reid who became 
the crimefighting green hornet 
i know it sounds like im copying but everyone saw what i 
saw kane said i was reinterpreting it was my vision my 
interpretation 
so within a weekend the batman was born

it is night in gotham a city of looming shadows expressionist 
architecture gutters and grinning gargoyles sixyearold bruce 
wayne is walking home from the movies the mark of zorro some 
say with his parents martha and dr thomas wayne 
a robber steps from the shadows an automatic in his hand a 
struggle he shoots dr and mrs wayne to death as the little boy 
watches the gunman flees the little boy sobs over the bodies of 
his parents

the minute that thomas and martha wayne died bruce wayne 
stopped living said denny oneill the batman writereditor at dc 
comics maybe he didnt know he was batman but he became the 
remorseless avenger 
the boy grows up he studies scientific crime detection 
acrobatics and martial arts he makes himself a supreme instrument 
of justice a fighter a forensic scientist an escape artist who 
rivals houdini a master of disguise 
the things hes about are obsession and human perfectablity 
which makes him unique among the pantheon of superheroes oneill 
said its about urban fears its about whats happened to cities 
in the last 100 years 
gotham city oneill explained is an important character in the 
batman saga gotham city is this dramatic brooding 
claustrophobic place where anytime you turn the corner something 
bad can happen he said 
robin the boy wonder joined batman in april 1940 his name was 
derived from robin hood another righter of wrongs and so were his 
red tunic and green boots 
you can argue that he was an essential element of batmans 
popularity because he counters all the grimness oneill said 
its also very useful for the grim avenger to have somebody to 
talk to so we can have what we writers call exposition 
robin was dick grayson the son of circus trapeze artists who saw 
his parents fall to their deaths slain by mobsters wayne took the 
young aerialist as his ward and soon the wisecracking young 
punster was a constant companion on the caped crusaders midnight 
patrols 
robin was for the kid reader to identify with which kind of 
puzzled me said the artistwriter jules feiffer the role of 
the kid was to be adventurous the role of the grownup was to save 
him 
the 40s were a great time for the dynamic duo when world war ii 
struck batman and robin fought at home against spies fifth 
columnists racketeers profiteers ration book counterfeiters 
they also conquered such enduring psychopaths as the penguin 
twoface and the joker the joker played by jack nicholson in the 
movie is a grinning greenhaired whitefaced leering clown 
prince of crime whose features were altered permanently by an 
unfortunate chemical bath he is utterly crazy 
by the early 50s some comic books were seriously nasty their 
stories of crime horror and war curdled with violence gore and 
bosomy babes in naughty clothes serious bondage and bad 
relationships 
sen estes keefauvers 195556 subcommittee on juvenile 
delinquency and other anticomics forces made the industry purge the 
sex and violence batman became a model citizen and role model 
he became a kind of bright sunny scoutmaster who would walk 
down the street and the people would say hi batman oneill 
said he wasnt the kind of guy who would scare me 
batman and robin traveled in time went to other planets and 
fought crooks in huge amusement parks futuristic playgrounds and 
vast arenas filled with oversized consumer goods and batmans 
inventions the batmobile batplane batcopter the multipurpose 
batarang and everuseful utility belt overwhelmed the scary aspect 
of batmans character 
his forensic abilities great scott theres only one place 
where you can find jute threads in gotham city were as sharp as 
ever but the fearsome underside of the batmans obsession was gone 
batman mutated into a beefy genial lanternjawed crookthumper 
who chuckled at robins awful pun in the last panel

batman is the hottest thing in tshirts right now said marek 
kiyashka whose company changes handles orders for batmanthemed 
shirts its been hot since early april and will probably be hot 
until october 
the batman bug has bitten scores of fans stores that normally 
would not carry or rarely carry any movie merchandise macys for 
example are carrying batman merchandise said brad nye 
publisher of biz the show business catalogue 
but what if batman the movie doesnt meet the feverish 
expectations and the movie fizzles will retailers be left with a 
surplus of batman pencil erasers refrigerator magnets and handcuffs 
although movie audiences have eagerly greeted the batman 
preview trailer the warner bros film is still an unknown quantity 
few people in hollywood have seen it whats more the batman 
character has limited audience appeal according to a 1988 marketing 
study 
in the test by marketing evaluation inc batman was less popular 
than deputy dawg moon mullins chicken little the incredible hulk 
and beany and cecil the california raisins in fact proved four 
times more appealing than the caped crusader 
on the strength of the characters appeal batman as a movie 
will have a hard time finding an audience said steven levitt 
president of marketing evaluation 
our projection is that batman as a movie will flop but 
that does not say that if you add up all the nickels and dimes of 
tshirts and lunch boxes and memo pads and balloons and every other 
license category under the sun that you cant aggregate all of that 
into 1 billion of license merchandise 
since the batman license holders dc comics and warner bros 
receive from 6 percent to 10 percent of the wholesale price of 
batman items sales from merchandise could generate a windfall 
furthermore store displays of the more than 100 different batman 
products may encourage reluctant moviegoers to take a chance on the 
film 
still while not everyone is pessimistic about the movies 
chances others are concerned that the span of batman goods may be 
too wide 
in the gift business i think theres an extraordinary 
opportunity here said bob solomon president of applause inc 
makers of batman plastic figurines pencil toppers stationery 
dolls coffee mugs and a batman suctioncup item which 
resembles the garfield cat dolls which some people attach to car 
windows 
but theres no getting around it the appeal for batman is 
somewhat limited and somewhat adult solomon said 
last year we did roger rabbit merchandise now well 
probably do as much volume with batman as we did with roger 
rabbit but we did it over a much wider age range with roger 
rabbit than batman 
among those cranking out batmanrelated items are view master 
hallmark cards butterick patterns onestop posters and 
fruitoftheloom 
the underwear maker is shipping a batmanfestooned childrens 
brief part of the companys funpals boys briefs which includes 
alf superman looney tunes and roger rabbit 
i think the batman underwear will be one of our top 
properties this year if not the no 1 seller said 
fruitoftheloom marketing manager debbie hills 
thermos too is confident that its batman lunch kit a lunch 
box and an insulated bottle will be a hit its definitely going 
to be in the top 10 in our lineup said thermos spokesman gary 
becker right up there with barbie and teenage mutant ninja 
turtles

avoiding the bothersome and timeconsuming 
process of actually writing original stories filmmakers are 
building new movies from a heap of dusty board games old songs and 
tattered comic books 
batman may not be the only movie adaptation but the caped 
crusader may set a record for having the most previous lives in a 
variety of comic books a tv series three television cartoons and 
two feature films 
the latest is the warner bros extravaganza starring michael 
keaton as batman and jack nicholson as his fiendish foil the joker 
with an average 18 million riding on every studio release it 
pays to stick with retreads look at all the james bond sequels 
see jane fonda remaking women on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown a critically acclaimed movie by spanish filmmaker 
pedro almodovar that was released only last year and watch columbia 
pictures redo 1963s lord of the flies 
the plots for you light up my life and ode to billy joe 
were taken from old records clue and the upcoming monopoly 
the movie were appropriated from parlor games 
batman like the superman films and a squadron of other 
current and future liveaction movies are all inspired by comic 
books dick tracy brenda starr the return of the swamp 
thing the punisher captain america watchmen 
spiderman teenage mutant ninja turtles and home box 
offices tales from the crypt 
theres something about the movie business thats really 
voracious as far as stories and characters are concerned said 
director wes craven who transformed a dc comic into 1982s swamp 
thing 
since the characters and stories in comics are in a sense 
presold theres a temptation to use a character thats already got 
a running start 
mark freedman who spun the independent comic teenage mutant 
ninja turtles into a toy line a television series and an upcoming 
feature film said a lot of people didnt realize that comic 
books were not necessarily a kiddie medium some comic books 
deal with pretty serious topics 
comics also unfold in a lively style that usually translates 
easily to film suggesting offbeat imaginative cinematography 
actually a comic is a visual movie said the inventor of 
captain america and veteran comic author jack kirby its a 
movie drawn by hand 
but sometimes for the filmmaker a comics catchy graphic look is 
as much a blessing as a curse 
director alan rudolph attempting to make a movie based on gary 
larsons the far side comic has labored to convert larsons 
distinctive caricatures into living breathing screen images after 
filming a fiveminute far side test paramount pictures passed 
on the project last year rudolph is still trying to convince 
another studio that his adaptation can work 
and while comicbook writers never have to worry about the cost 
of elaborate special effects movie studios do 
the real tricky thing in swamp thing was that the comic book 
had a tremendous amount of mutation heads with just hands on them 
strange monsters and at that time the budget for the movie was 
25 million said craven the effects were completely outside 
of our budget so we had to deal with more human villains and 
creations i think we used one dwarf 
comicbook characters also have a diversity of personalities and 
movie studios are bound to select the personality with the broadest 
possible audience appeal take warner bros and its approach to 
batman 
as remembered by fans of the television series and feature film 
of the late 1960s batman is a campy crimefighter a goofy 
dogooder but those familiar with the early dc comic recollect a 
darker obsessive figure and in the 1986 batman graphic novel 
collection the dark knight returns the caped crusader is a 
troubled vigilante the latter two batmans would never be mistaken 
for matinee idols 
warner producers didnt seem sure which batman they wanted from 
the final dark batman script written by sam hamm to the upbeat 
shooting script doctored by warren skaaren batman loses his 
paranoid fears the joker cast as a bizarre overwhelmingly 
malevolent criminal in hamms screenplay appears as a droll almost 
lighthearted thug in the finished film 
and that may leave some comicbook devotees disappointed 
im going to see batman said ron mann director of the new 
documentary comic book confidential which traces the history of 
the comics but it has nothing to do with the comic book 
absolutely nothing

the ateam had to wait until classes let 
out to descend into the boys gym office at dimner beeber middle 
school so they didnt frighten students with their masks and 
billowy airtight suits 
their mission is to remove asbestos insulation from a leaking 
steam pipe as required by a federal law that is forcing every school 
in the nation to take costly and drastic steps to control a mineral 
once used widely as a fire retardant it is now linked to lung 
cancer and other diseases 
ive seen people die of asbestosis said jim breslin 
abatement supervisor for the philadelphia school district and a 
former pipe insulator at the philadelphia naval shipyard im not 
interested in catching it 
its a fight some say could have been avoided if asbestos 
companies had heeded and divulged early warnings of health risks 
instead the substance was used in insulation ceilings floors and 
walls for decades 
the philadelphia school district will have to spend 4256 
million to remove asbestos from more than 400 buildings including 
291 used by children in addition to more than 50 million already 
spent on asbestos abatement in the nations sixthlargest school 
district 
every school had to submit an asbestos management plan by may 9 
or face fines up to 5000 a day under the asbestos hazard emergency 
response act of 1986 some 21 percent of us school systems had 
violated the law by not filing plans before the original oct 12 
deadline or obtaining a deferral to may 9 
pennsylvania schools were fifthworst with 413 percent failing 
to comply indiana had 415 percent not in compliance maine 419 
percent virginia 439 percent and mississippi 462 percent 
compliance generally has been higher for public than private 
schools said environmental protection agency spokeswoman alicia 
tenuta in washington 
an estimated 44600 of the nations 107000 school buildings 
contain asbestos that could become dangerous 
asbestos fibers can cause asbestosis a scarring of lung tissue 
that diminishes breathing capacity mesothelioma a cancer of the 
lining of the chest or abdominal cavity and lung cancer often long 
after exposure 
the cleanup law requires only management not removal of all 
asbestos 
were talking well into the next century for some of this 
removal said bernard rafferty district asbestos cleanup chief 
nevertheless the district expects to spend 758 million fighting 
asbestos during the next six years 
we dont question the need to address this environmental 
hazard said albert i glassman associate superintendent for 
buildings 
im sure responsible school people all over the nation feel the 
same way but we do question the imposition of the total burden for 
doing this on the backs of financially strapped school systems 
washington has provided little to offset cleanup costs the epa 
estimates at 3 billion nationwide from fiscal 19851988 160 
million had been distributed under the asbestos school hazard 
abatement act with 475 million to be distributed this year said 
epa spokesman lee blackburn 
its clear theres limited resources for schools and a lot of 
other demands educational reform issues increasing teachers 
salaries drug education said joel c packer coordinator of the 
washingtonbased asbestos in schools coalition his organization is 
pushing for more federal money 
the law requires states to review plans and monitor abatement 
the department of environmental resources ordered by gov robert 
p casey to review the plans was 3 months late with its report on 
compliance it gave pennsylvania schools a higher mark than epa 
with 36 percent noncompliance but the der still is developing ways 
to review the plans casting uncertainty over cleanups that the law 
requires to start by july 9 
school districts either cannot go ahead with removal work or 
run the risk of having to do work over again if it is not approved 
by der said state sen mike fisher chairman of the senate 
environmental resources and energy committee 
we have acknowledged that weve had a slow start but were 
moving very aggressively now der deputy secretary mark m 
mcclellan said the department is adding staff and plans to hire 
contractors this summer to speed the reviews 
much of the problem is the constant change brought on by the 
fragility of asbestos even after it is declared contained kids 
knock up against it with their chairs stick a pencil in it or a 
water leak occurs and breaks it down said glassman 
those cases are treated as emergencies by the 30member fulltime 
ateam trained in an epacertified program a cteam of 60 
maintenance workers has been cleared for parttime work both teams 
use the same procedures as workers in other schools once a problem 
is located 
using plastic sheeting the beeber ateam has sealed the boys 
gym office where the leaking pipe was found workers pass through 
two additional chambers of plastic that serve as safety traps the 
office is ventilated by a filter that catches 9997 percent of any 
fibers each worker going in dons two suits of a nonbreathable 
synthetic material a health hygienist monitors the air they breathe 
through masks 
when work begins in earnest this week with the end of school the 
asbestos will be sprayed with a wetting agent cut with a razor 
knife sprayed again and bagged no more than 20 pounds per bag 
because the bag might break 
on the way out the workers shed one suit in one chamber the 
second in the second chamber to ensure no fibers leave with them 
by the time they are done air samples must show less than 001 
fibers per cubic centimeter at times it might seem like overkill 
but you never know when youre going to have a problem breslin 
said 
each step is recorded the date work started how much asbestos 
is removed where it is taken how many fibers showed up on samples 
since theres such a long gestation period for these cancers 
and these cancerlike diseases its possible that 30 40 50 years 
would go by and then someone who gets cancer would file a personal 
injury suit said patricia donovan attorney for the school 
district 
i dont want my successors to have to try to reconstruct what 
happened in 1988 1989 and 1990

britains civil aviation authority on monday 
grounded all 12 boeing 737400 aircraft operated by british carriers 
following two recent engine failures 
both incidents involved damage to fan blades in cfm563c engines 
manufactured by snecma of france in a joint venture with general 
electric co the same engine and plan also was involved in a fatal 
crash in january 
in seattle kirotv reported that federal aviation administration 
officials were preparing an airworthiness directive based on the 
british action but there was no immediate indication what the 
contents would be 
spokesman t craig martin of boeing co in seattle confirmed only 
that there had been talks monday between faa officials and 
representatives of the manufacturer 
we consider our communications with the faa to be essentially 
private martin said 
on friday a danair 737400 carrying 100 charter passengers to 
minorca returned to londons gatwick airport after developing severe 
vibration in one engine 
the airline said the problem developed 15 minutes into the flight 
at an altitude of 31000 feet 
on sunday a british midlands 737400 flying from londons 
heathrow airport to belfast northern ireland with 80 people aboard 
made an emergency landing at east midlands airport after a problem 
developed in one engine

been damaged

reported that one engine had failed in flight but investigators

the federal aviation administration says it 
continues to monitor maintenance practices at strikebound eastern 
airlines although the company and an faa spokesman say the agency 
told eastern informally it had turned up no irregularities in 
maintenance paperwork 
in a recording played since friday on its tollfree telephone 
hot line for employees eastern said the faa has advised it that 
recent inspections at maintenance hubs in miami and atlanta did not 
uncover any systemwide problems 
faa spokesman fred farrar in washington said monday he couldnt 
confirm the agency told eastern no paperwork irregularities had been 
found he said the final report on a recordkeeping investigation 
that ended may 12 had not yet been submitted to acting faa 
administrator robert e whittington 
but jack barker an faa spokesman in atlanta confirmed that the 
agency had told eastern the information in question he also noted 
that the final report hasnt yet been given to whittington 
easterns unions and others have raised questions about 
maintenance and safety at the airline which has weathered a 
crippling strike since march 4 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation recently 
wrote whittington that she was concerned that shortages of staff and 
spare parts could be hampering easterns ability to properly 
maintain its fleet 
farrar said the faa undertook a special surveillance of 
easterns overall safety after the strike began although he said 
there is no separate distinct inspection currently going on 
visavis easterns maintenance 
robin matell a spokesman for eastern in miami said the 
telephone recording was made by eastern spokesman jim ashlock on 
friday 
faa informally advised us today that the miami and atlanta 
maintenance inspections turned up no irregularities in paperwork or 
gaps in missing records the recording said 
the faa concluded that it could not discover any evidence 
showing a systemwide maintenance problem at eastern with improper 
record entries or missing documents ashlock said on the tape 
which still was being played monday 
easterns recording also said the faa had reinstated eight 
eastern maintenance supervisors at new yorks john f kennedy 
international airport who had been temporarily suspended 
early last month eastern temporarily surrendered its repair 
station certificate at jfk after the faa determined the carrier had 
failed to follow its system for recording and inspecting maintenance 
work 
but kathleen bergen a spokeswoman in the faas eastern region 
office at kennedy airport said monday that any suspensions or 
reinstatements of eastern personnel would have been made by the 
airline itself not the agency 
we never took any action against any individuals she said 
the suspension of the jfk certificate was for actions that 
predated the march 4 start of the strike which pushed eastern into 
bankruptcy court five days later 
soon after the jfk certificate was pulled the faa sent nine 
inspectors to easterns main base in miami to determine if 
violations of maintenance record keeping rules such as those found 
in new york existed in miami and atlanta 
jfk miami international and atlantas hartsfield international 
are the sites of easterns three principal maintenance facilities 
in her june 1 letter to whittington collins said her 
subcommittees staff reviewed internal company documents indicating 
that manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the 
maintenance function of eastern 
collins who is recovering from recent surgery was reported to 
be unavailable to comment monday on the eastern recording 
although the faa says it is not conducting a special 
investigation of eastern maintenance practices at miami and atlanta 
easterns pilots union contends the union has participated in such a 
probe 
representatives of the pilots and machinists unions met with faa 
inspectors may 1516 in the context of that inquiry according to a 
pilots union spokesman who asked not to be identified

preacher jimmy swaggarts admission of 
sin was a blow not only to his television ministry but to the 
economy of a city that already was hurting from the downturn in the 
oil industry 
at its peak swaggarts ministry was a 150millionayear 
operation it remains one of the biggest industries in the area but 
area business owners and managers know that they arent as well off 
as they were before scandal touched the fundamentalist evangelist 
when you take a 150 million industry and cripple it of course 
the entire communitys going to feel it said butch spyridon 
executive director of the baton rouge area convention and visitors 
bureau 
it was in february 1988 when swaggart confessed to moral failure 
from the stage of his family worship center church at the heart of 
his 270acre compound although swaggart didnt admit specifics a 
rival minister revealed that the transgression involved liaisons 
with a new orleans prostitute 
baton rouges economy has paid along with swaggart for his sins 
where i used to get 150 rooms a night now i may get 75 said 
craig michelet manager of a holiday inn near swaggarts compound 
and im probably the only hotel in baton rouge still getting any 
of that business 
michelet remembers the old days fondly swaggarts followers 
never got rowdy and didnt frequent the motel bar 
they were the easiest guests you could have michelet said 
it was great business 
the huge ministry had scheduled nine conventions in 1988 expected 
to pull 45000 delegates and 14 million into the baton rouge 
economy 
most would have come for the familyoriented fourday camp 
meetings swaggart usually scheduled over holiday periods that 
traditionally generated little touristoriented revenue 
we lost millions last year although some of that was on 
paper because he had more meetings scheduled for 1988 than ever 
before spyridon said 
his ministry has been our largest single supplier of convention 
delegates make no mistake about it jimmy swaggart was good 
business for baton rouge 
and he still is he still draws it just isnt what it used to 
be the visitorbureau director added and weve really hustled 
to try and book more groups and make up for what we lost from mr 
swaggarts problems fortunately we managed to land the us hot 
air balloon national championships for 19891991 
almost half the faculty has left the jimmy swaggart bible 
college many left to save their credentials with the assemblies of 
god the denomination that defrocked swaggart when he refused to 
accept a oneyear rehabilitation church leaders ordered 
many have left the state for employment and schools elsewhere 
dumping homes and apartments onto a real estate market already 
suffering with the rest of louisiana from the downturn in the 
states oilbased economy 
faculty members from the bible college are among about 600 
employees who have either been laid off or left swaggarts employ 
since the ministry boasted in its 1986 heyday that its roster of 
1400plus employees and 16 million payroll had a snowball 
spending effect that infused about 305 million into the baton 
rouge economy 
attendance at the college is off by about 75 percent from 1450 
in 1987 to 400 now 
since 1981 the ministry spent more than 123 million on 
construction and land purchases making it the largest sponsor of 
construction in east baton rouge parish over the past five years 
but the first activity swaggarts tearful confession stopped at 
the complex was construction 
a new 9 million bible college dormitory still stands 
halffinished work was frozen and properties were mortgaged for 12 
million to cover construction debts records show 
jimmy still brings people in he still makes business for baton 
rouge said don gerald jr vice president of a restaurant near 
swaggarts ministries 
but its not what it used to be gerald said

in one day the number of coal miners on 
strike in appalachia increased fivefold and many of the union 
members who have walked off the job expect their numbers will swell 
even more 
theyre going to try to shut down all the union and nonunion 
mines by the end of next week said dave evans a pittston coal 
group inc miner youll see a nationwide and canadian strike 
whatever it takes to get this settled 
at issue is a 2monthold walkout by the umw against pittston 
over wage benefit and workrule disputes but miners say thats not 
all thats at stake many believe that if pittston wins a precedent 
will be set that could reverse gains made by labor unions early this 
century 
about 1600 union miners have been striking pittston operations 
in virginia and west virginia since early april on monday 
thousands of miners at other coal companies in appalachia walked off 
the job many saying they have to take a stand now or lose their 
union rights 
its going to be the same for all coal miners if pittston beats 
the umw on this said one miner who walked off his job monday at 
hobet mining in mingo county 
underground miners in west virginia refused to show up for the 
overnight shift monday less than eight hours after many attended a 
rally at which umw president richard trumka told them to rise up 
and fight back 
three west virginia mines also reported workers failed to return 
for todays midnight shift 
whatever its gonna take to get the court systems to drop the 
fines and get our fellas out of jail in virginia thats how long 
itll last said perry harvey a umw field representative in logan 
the umw already was involved in a twostate strike against 
pittston and a smaller strike against new beckley mining in raleigh 
county in the pittston strike a state judge in virginia jailed 
three union leaders and fined the union 3 million for disobeying a 
court order limiting pickets 
mondays wildcat strikes spread to operations throughout the rest 
of umw district 17 which has 8000 members in southern west 
virginia the president of the west virginia coal association 
estimated 10000 miners refused to show up for work 
its fair to say that all of southern west virginia is 
affected as far as i can tell said gary white president of the 
coal association 
west virginias largest coal field employer consolidation coal 
said only one of its operations was struck but it immediately asked 
for and obtained a court order telling its workers to return to work 
attorneys for the company argued that when the 250 of its 4000 
workers walked out they violated terms of a 1988 contract barring 
strikes and that their walkout could keep the company from meeting 
its contracts 
us district judge dennis knapp agreed and ordered the men back 
to the rowland mine pending another hearing june 22 when the 
temporary order expires 
peabody coal the nations top coal producer saw 2360 union 
miners walk out at midnight sunday said tom clarke a peabody 
attorney 
pittston miners struck april 5 after working more than 14 months 
without a contract pittston had refused to sign the 1988 bituminous 
coal operators association agreement that most other coal companies 
had signed about 100 miners have been striking at new beckley since 
january 
over the course of the pittston walkout by 1600 miners in 
virginia and west virginia more than 2200 miners retirees and 
their wives have been arrested for civil disobedience such as 
blocking coal trucks 
union leaders did not return several telephone calls from the 
associated press seeking comment the leaders have repeatedly 
stressed that the strike was not sanctioned by the union 
under terms of the 1988 bcoa agreement miners can take a 10day 
memorial period to air grievences none of the coal companies 
struck monday said they were informed that this would be a 10day 
work stoppage

dallas billionaire harold c simmons says he 
boosted his stake in lockheed corp to more than 6 percent from 42 
percent for investment purposes not to mount a takeover of the 
defense contractor 
simmons revealed monday that valhi inc nl industries inc and 
various other simmons companies had spent 6927 million including 
commissions to purchase 144 million shares of lockheed stock 
between may 15 and thursday 
the purchases which ranged in price from 47 to 49 per share 
make him one of the largest individual shareholders in the 
calabasas califbased company 
lockheed stock inched up 625 cents to close at 4962 in 
composite trading monday on the new york stock exchange 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission simmons 
said the lastest purchases were for purposes of investment and in 
order to acquire a significant equity interest in the company 
the filing said simmons does not currently have any plans to 
acquire control of the company by stock ownership or otherwise 
although it did not rule out such a move in the future 
earlier this year simmons revealed a 53 percent stake in the 
company prompting lockheed to create an employee stock ownership 
plan that effectively blocked any takeover ploy one day after the 
creation of the esop which holds 17 percent of lockheed stock 
simmons reduced his holding to 42 percent 
analysts have said the esops holding effectively blocks a 
lockheed takeover because in delaware where the company is 
incorporated a buyout must be approved by holders of 85 percent of 
a companys stock 
simmons sec filing said he met with lockheed chairman daniel m 
tellep and vice chairman vincent n marafino on may 15 the same day 
simmons began his recent purchases to discuss his investment 
lockheed spokesman ron meder described the meeting as 
cordial but said the company would have no further comment on 
simmons action 
in the filing simmons included a march 31 letter to tellep 
saying we view lockheed as a well managed company we have no 
plans or desire to disrupt management we expect to be a 
constructive longterm shareholder 
analysts said monday they believe that description still holds 
steven kinney who follows valhi for baird patrick amp co inc in 
new york said simmons first and foremost duty is to enhance 
stockholder value and greed and calculation will always be second 
to this interest 
he suggested simmons hopes to make money on the lockheed stock to 
use in other possible takeover moves 
simmons whose worth is estimated at 15 billion by fortune 
magazine has holdings in chemical timber and sugar industries

the government is giving carmakers six months 
to equip all new hardtop cars with backseat lap and shoulder belts 
but a safety research group says the new rule doesnt go far enough 
industry officials meanwhile said the order announced monday by 
the national highway traffic safety admnistration came as no 
surprise but nonetheless might speed up some planned installations 
more than half of 1989 cars already have such belts and they are 
scheduled for nearly all 1990 models industry and government 
officials said 
the rule will apply to all cars built after middecember except 
convertibles which are unlikely to be affected until the 1991 model 
year 
the safety agency said it was still working on detailed 
installation requirements for the rearseat belts as well as orders 
requiring them for convertibles vans small trucks and utility 
vehicles 
todays action makes the united states one of the first major 
vehicleproducing nations in the world to require rearseat lap and 
shoulder belts by regulation the highway safety agency said in 
announcing the rule 
brian oneill spokesman for the insurance institute for highway 
safety said testing rules are needed to ensure that shoulder safety 
belt systems work properly in each cars back seat 
our position is that if all you do is write a rule that the 
manufacturers are already following its not worth doing oneill 
said 
rear seat cushions in some cars may be too soft or improperly 
designed for effective shoulder belt use in the rear he said the 
institute is an independent nonprofit research and educational 
organization funded by the insurance industry 
in addition to the rear lapshoulder belts 1990 models must have 
frontseat air bags or automatic shoulder restraints carmakers can 
either install dual air bags dual automatic restraints or a single 
air bag on the drivers side and a manual or automatic restraint on 
the passengers side 
air bags inflate in a crash automatic restraints move into place 
as the driver or passenger enters the car 
the highway safety administration which is part of the 
department of transportation said about 2000 rearseat passengers 
die each year in road crashes and 600 lives could be saved if even 
existing lap belts were used by everyone riding in the back seat 
the agency did not estimate the number of lives that might be 
saved with the new order which would not affect any cars now on the 
road however if both shoulder and lap belts were used by the 16 
percent of backseat passengers who now use laponly belts it said 
25 more lives and 500 serious injuries could be avoided each year 
government surveys show that frontseat safety belt use has 
reached an alltime high of 47 percent with 33 states and the 
district of columbia requiring their use use of rearseat belts has 
increased eightfold over the last six years with five states 
requiring it officials said 
fred bowditch vice president of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association in detroit said 50 percent to 60 percent of 1989 cars 
have both lap and shoulder belts as standard equipment in the rear 
seat 
he said all manufacturers had planned to put the belts on even 
without a federal order in the next year or two he said the 
order may hurry up the schedule a little bit for a few models 
according to the insurance institute lap and shoulder belts are 
optional for the rear seat on chrysler cars and on some ford models 
but are already standard equipment on many ford and on all general 
motors cars and most foreign autos sold in the united states

the newly established bahrain stock 
exchange will start trading on saturday about six months later than 
originally planned its director announced tuesday 
fawzi behzad told a news conference the opening was delayed in 
order to complete discussions with financial authorities on 
marketactivity rules he said the dealing hall located in the 
citys financial center also had to be completed 
behzad and other officials say they hope the islands stock 
exchange will become the wall street of the gulf region 
now we deal in local bahrain companies we chall be moving to 
gulf companies then to the international companies he said 
the bahrain exchange will seek to attract private arab wealth 
accumulated during the 1970s oil boom that is currently invested 
abroad such holdings are estimated at around 150 billion 
its cautious beginning reflects official determination to avoid 
overheating of the kind that triggered the 1982 crash of kuwaits 
unofficial almanakh stock market under the pressure of 94 billion 
worth of postdated checks 
behzad said the market would trade for just 90 minutes daily and 
will close on fridays the moslem weekend 
he said five individual brokers and two financial companies would 
trade stock of 29 bahraini national companies that have a combined 
total of 44 billion shares their total nominal value is set at 
16 billion 
share values will be limited to a 15 percent move up or down on 
any trading day 
nationals of other gulf cooperation council states will be 
allowed to deal on the bahrain market but company ownership 
percentages have not yet been defined behzad said 
the gcc which groups bahrain kuwait oman the united arab 
emirates and saudi arabia has set the ceiling for ownership by 
citizens of one membercountry in companies of another at 25 percent 
behzad said the stock exchanges founding decree permits eventual 
trading in government bonds real estate and other financial 
instruments but set no date for the expansion 
the bahrain stock exchange opening comes as the gulf region 
anticipates an economic recovery based on improved oil prices and 
reconstruction after last augusts ceasefire in the 8year 
iraniraq war 
behzad said he hoped that each gcc country would eventually have 
its own exchange so that we shall be able to coordinate for the 
future it will push a gulf market in general 
oman last month opened a smallscale stock exchange where gcc 
nationals are permitted to deal kuwait has had an official stock 
exchange since the mid1970s and is reactivating the unofficial 
almanakh market while unofficial trading is carried out in saudi 
arabia

bring in excess of 150 million 
after all the spinoffs are completed hca will be left with about 
80 acute care domestic hospitals with about 3 billion in annual 
revenues

than 400 million to equicor a joint venture between hca and the 
equitable life assurance society of the united states

rural and suburban hospitals for 2 billion to a managementled 
group that formed a new company called healthtrust inc

security pacific corp one of the nations

despite four failed attempts to offer a futures 
contract based on homemortgage rates the chicago board of trade 
has decided it will try once again starting friday 
the contract will track the current coupon for the government 
national mortgage association known as gnma or ginnie mae and will 
be traded four months in the future in units of 100000 
the bot first tried the contract in 1975 and again in 1978 1984 
and 1986 each eventually fell by the wayside either because of the 
complexity of the design or a lack of interest from local traders 
that kept the contract from being liquid enough to sustain itself 
officials expect this version to succeed because of its 
simplicity 
potentially the market is bigger than the corporate bond 
market and with the volatility in mortgages in recent years there 
seems to be a real need for some sort of hedging device bot 
spokesman mike oconnell said monday 
this should look attractive to savings and loans mortgage 
bankers anybody who originates mortgages or deals in 
mortgagebacked securities 
traditionally institutional holders of mortgages and 
mortgagebacked securities bought us treasury securities or 
overthecounter options as a hedge 
but bot officials say the new contract will provide better 
protection against sudden swings in the interest rate by offering a 
futures contract that can be matched up with a cash position 
lets say you hold a gnma coupon for 10 percent suddenly 
interest rates drop to 9 percent and everybody refinances their 
mortgages now youve got a check for the original amount but no 
longer the revenue stream you thought you would have said sam 
kahan economist for kleinwort benson government securities inc 
chicago 
you could have hedged that if you were able to find a futures 
position that mirrored your cash position 
but kahan mindful of four failed efforts at such a contract 
withheld a prediction on whether investors would take to the product 
james florsheim a chicago corp vice president and hedging 
consultant and broker for financial institutions said big customers 
will be the ones to make this product go 
the savingsandloan mentality used to be that when you got 
caught holding mortgages behind interest rates you put the losers 
in a drawer and waited until you could get the value back 
florsheim said 
the idea now is to get the sampls back into the ballgame he 
said and giving them a hedge like this might be a step in the 
right direction people are more aware of the need for this now than 
at times in the past

as floridas citrus industry heads into the 
home stretch of the 19881989 harvest government forecasters 
reported about 2 million more boxes of oranges harvested than they 
had calculated last month 
the larger crop estimate translates to about 24 million more in 
industry income with prices for valencia oranges running at about 
12 a box delivered to processing plants 
the final value of the crop should be up there near the 
record of 13 billion set last season said bob terry citrus 
statistician with the florida agricultural statistics service in 
orlando 
the joint federal and state forecasting service projected monday 
that the harvest which ends july 1 will total 1463 million boxes 
of oranges and 5535 million boxes of grapefruit a box of oranges 
is equivalent to 90 pounds of fruit and a box of grapefruit is 
equal to 85 pounds 
while the orange forecast increased 2 million boxes from last 
months estimate because of the bigger valencia crop the grapefruit 
estimate was reduced by 500000 boxes the grapefruit crop still 
would be a record however just surpassing the 548 millionbox 
bumper crop picked in 19791980 
terry said both the orange and grapefruit adjustments were made 
to reflect amounts of fruit actually appearing in processing and 
packing plants 
california citrus forecasters also have had some difficulty 
nailing down the size of that states crop second in size to 
floridas among us producers 
california which is just completing its early and midseason 
orange harvest reduced its early and midcrop estimate by 1 million 
boxes to 34 million and lowered its valencia forecast by 2 million 
boxes to 23 million californias harvest typically lags behind 
floridas by three or four months because of differences in climate 
crop forecasters predicted monday that the juice yield for 
florida oranges would remain the same at 153 gallons of 
concentrated juice per box 
the last crop estimate of the season will be made july 12 and 
the final numbers for the completed season will be released sept 
29 just before the start of the new harvest on oct 1

grain and soybean futures prices rose modestly in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade following an 
agriculture department report estimating the us winter wheat crop 
at an 11year low 
in a report issued after the close of trading monday the usda 
pegged the droughtravaged winter wheat crop at 141 billion 
bushels down 10 percent from last years harvest and 2 percent 
below the may forecast 
but buying enthusiasm was tempered by forecasts for 
drierthannormal conditions early next week in the great plains 
which would accelerate the winter wheat harvest 
corn and soybean futures were supported in part by indications of 
strong export sales of those commodities last week but lower prices 
in europe for soybean meal and soybean oil kept a lid on the rally 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 390 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 
1 cents higher with july at 250 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
2 cents higher with july at 159 a bushel soybeans were cent to 
2 cents higher with july at 695 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly 
higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 25 cent lower to 10 cent higher with june at 
7032 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 22 cent lower 
with august at 8045 cents a pound hogs were unchanged to 22 cent 
higher with june at 4820 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
10 cent to 67 cent higher with july at 3420 cents a pound

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade worsened dramatically in the first three months of the year 
widening to 3069 billion the government reported today 
the commerce department said the deficit in the current account 
was 7 percent larger than the 2868 billion imbalance run up in the 
final three months of 1988 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but also transactions in services primarily 
investment flows between countries 
the merchandise trade deficit improved sharply in the first 
quarter narrowing by 137 percent to 2763 billion however this 
improvement was wiped out by a decline in the services category 
which fell to a tiny 369 million surplus from a surplus of 836 
billion in the fourth quarter of 1988 
analysts said the steep drop in the services surplus reflected 
the fact that the dollar rose in the first quarter lowering 
american businesses earnings overseas 
the current account provides a measure of the amount of money 
this country must raise abroad to finance its economy the united 
states because of huge merchandise trade deficits was transformed 
from the worlds largest creditor nation to the largest debtor 
country during the 1980s 
simply put that means that foreigners now own more us assets 
than americans hold overseas both the reagan and bush 
administrations have claimed that this is a sign of strength 
showing that the united states remains a popular place to invest 
however private economists have warned that the growing debt 
burden will ultimately lower americas standard of living as more 
and more dollars are handed over to foreigners as interest payments 
on the debt 
with the 3069 billion current account deficit in the first 
quarter the imbalance between us holdings abroad and foreign 
holdings in the united states has probably climbed past 500 
billion up from 368 billion at the end of 1987 however the 
government will not release the official calculation of that figure 
until june 29 
as recently as 1981 the united states ran surpluses in its 
current account because the nations cushion in overseas investment 
earnings was enough to offset perennial merchandise trade deficits 
but in 1985 the united states became a net debtor for the first 
time in 71 years as the value of american investments overseas were 
surpassed by the value of foreign holdings in the united states 
that reflected the fact that billions of dollars had been 
transferred into foreign hands to pay for foreign cars and 
television sets and other imported goods 
todays report said that in addition to the 2763 billion 
deficit in merchandise trade and the 369 million surplus in the 
services category the 3069 billion current account deficit 
reflected payments of 342 billion in foreign aid and pensions to 
americans living overseas 
in other government reports on the economy today 
regulatory agencies reported that the nations 2938 savings and 
loan institutions amassed net losses of 34 billion in the first 
quarter of the year while the 13001 commercial us banks were 
enjoying record profits totaling 73 billion for all of 1988 sampls 
toted up 13 billion in losses and banks posted a record 251 
billion in profits 
retail sales rose a sluggish 01 percent in may held down by a 
decline in department store sales and a slowdown in activity at 
automobile dealership the commerce department said sales climbed 
to a seasonally adjusted 1411 billion last month after rising 1 
percent in april

a third of all major bank fraud cases are not being 
pursued because the justice department lacks resources attorney 
general dick thornburg said today 
thornburg told the dallas bank fraud task force a recent survey 
indicates 8343 bank fraud related matters and cases pending in 
various us attorneys of fbi offices with 4000 classified as 
major bank fraud 
over 2300 of the pending cases were inactive for lack of 
adequate investigatory resources or prosecutorial resources and 
1332 of those were classified as major bank fraud he said 
thornburg urged passage of the bush administrations thrift 
bailout bill which includes 50 million to investigate major thrift 
industry fraud 
he said the added money would allow the justice department to 
double its bank fraud investigations adding 200 fbi agents and 100 
prosecutors and other personnel 
the attorney general estimated that between 25 percent to 30 
percent of the industrys losses are attributable to fraud 
the dallas task force is an interagency effort to prosecute 
malfeasance in the thrift and banking industry it has come under 
some criticism for failed prosecutions

hundreds of miners today defied a 
backtowork order and joined thousands of fellow united mine 
workers across west virginia in the second day of a sympathy strike 
the miners walked out monday in a show of support for 1600 umw 
members on strike against pittston coal group in virginia and west 
virginia since april 
theyre going to try to shut down all the union and nonunion 
mines by the end of next week said dave evans a striking 
pittston miner youll see a nationwide and canadian strike 
whatever it takes to get this settled 
an industry official today said the walkout appeared to be 
confined to southern west virginias umw district 17 the unions 
largest with 8000 members 
consolidation coal co said 250 of its 4000 employees stayed off 
the job today despite a backtowork order issued by a federal judge 
on monday the company had argued that its workers were barred by 
contract from striking 
as of this morning the court order has been ignored said 
consolidated spokesman paul kvederis he had no other word on what 
the company planned to do 
top union leaders did not immediately return calls today umw 
leaders have insisted the strike was spontaneous and not sanctioned 
by the union 
under their 1988 contract the miners can take a 10day 
memorial period and walk off the job to air grievances but they 
must give notice beforehand none of the coal companies struck 
monday said they were informed 
the president of the west virginia coal association estimated 
10000 miners refused to show up for work monday 
the number of mines or mining companies affected by the walkout 
was not immediately available 
monays wildcat action was in support of the 2monthold walkout 
umw against pittston many miners say a pittston victory might set a 
precedent that could reverse gains made by unions early this century 
the pittston miners have been working without a contract for 14 
months they went on strike over wages benefits and working 
conditions 
over the course of the pittston walkout more than 2200 miners 
retirees and their spouses have been arrested for civil disobedience 
such as blocking coal trucks 
a state judge in virginia has jailed three union leaders and 
fined the union 3 million for disobeying an order limiting pickets 
at pittston 
whatever its gonna take to get the court systems to drop the 
fines and get our fellas out of jail in virginia thats how long 
itll last said perry harvey a umw field representative in logan

a federal judge has denied requests from 
three states for jurisdiction over maxicare health plans inc 
bankruptcy proceedings 
us district judge john j wilson issued orders monday allowing 
the health maintenance organizations subsidiaries to operate under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in arizona louisiana and texas 
the ruling was a small victory for los angelesbased maxicare 
which is seeking to preserve as much as possible of its former 
nationwide health care network since it filed for bankruptcy 
protection march 16 
state regulators had said they had the expertise to rehabilitate 
the hmos but state control of the bankruptcy proceedings left open 
the possibility states would liquidate the units to pay maxicares 
claims 
maxicare cited a backlog of pastdue debts to providers among the 
reasons for seeking protection from creditors 
other states that have sought jurisdiction in the case include 
illinois indiana and ohio the orders given to attorneys monday did 
not include motions filed from those states

prime minister margaret thatcher said tuesday she 
fully supports chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson as she moved 
to dispel reports of a split over monetary policy 
in answer to questions in the house of commons mrs thatcher 
said i give full unequivocal and generous backing to my 
chancellor of whom i am very proud 
the comments followed speculation she and lawson are at odds over 
whether the british currency should join the exchange rate mechanism 
of the european monetary system 
mrs thatcher has said joining the mechanism could damage the 
governments antiinflation battle while lawson has said it would 
help buttress monetary policies to bring inflation down 
however lawson on monday also indicated he didnt see sterling 
joining the mechanism until 1990 at the earliest 
thatcher also said she agreed with lawson that the governments 
overriding objective is to reduce inflation 
the conservative government has come under criticism for its 
handling of the economy britains inflation rate has more than 
doubled to 8 percent in a year while the trade deficit has ballooned 
in an effort to fight inflation the government has pushed up 
interest rates to 14 percent from a decade low of 75 percent last 
summer

president bushs call for detroit to build 
alternatives to gasolinepowered cars is expected to propel the 
fledgling clean fuels move into overdrive 
one of the main beneficiaries may be the natural gas industry it 
is heavily promoting the idea of running cars on compressed natural 
gas which emits less of some pollutants than vehicles burning 
gasoline or diesel fuel 
natural gas also is a raw material for methanol the bush 
administrations favored choice for an alternative to gasoline oil 
companies however are critical of the methanol move which they 
say presents many cost and safety problems 
yet another alternative fuel is ethanol made from fermented corn 
and agricultural wastes it is limited in supply and more expensive 
than methanol or gasoline 
bush was seeking to drum up public support for alternative fuels 
tuesday with appearances in nebraska a big corn producer that last 
year used more ethanolbased fuel as a share of its total vehicle 
fuels market than any other state 
the aim of the bush proposal announced monday as part of a 
broader environmental package is to reduce vehicles contribution 
to air pollution but it also would mean higher prices for 
consumers if gasoline is gradually eliminated analysts said 
gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone 
that causes smog 
a key element of the bush plan is a phasedin requirement for 
auto manufacturers to produce alternatives to gasolinepowered autos 
in the nine major urban areas with the worst smog problems 
half a million such cars would have to be available by 1995 and 
1 million would have to be produced each year from 1997 through 
2004 the urban areas are los angeles houston new york milwaukee 
baltimore philadelphia san diego chicago and greater 
connecticut 
itll be a big boost for alternative fuel use said scott 
denman director of the safe energy communication council an 
environmental group that favors reducing use of fossil fuels mainly 
by improving energy and vehicle efficiency 
the technology exists to produce cars capable of running on 
alternative fuels the auto companies have hesitated to undertake 
fullscale production because of a concern that the fuels are not 
yet widely available while the oil companies balk at producing 
large quantities of the fuels until the vehicles win consumer 
acceptance 
william reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency told reporters the auto and oil industries must find a way 
of resolving this stalemate 
the point of this programis to make sure that we solve the 
chickenandegg problem that we have the fuel available to service 
the cars and the cars available to use the fuel he said adding 
that industry must ensure that that happens 
the oil industry strongly criticized the alternative fuels 
portion of bushs proposal which will be sent to capitol hill in 
coming weeks the industry wants a pilot program at least partly 
financed by the government to work out the technical and economic 
kinks before commercialscale production is required 
we are disappointed by the administrations apparent preference 
for mandating alternatefuel vehicles an extremely costly and 
inflexible step which would provide highly uncertain environmental 
benefits and presumably requirehigher prices for all fuels 
said the american petroleum institute the oil industrys main 
lobbying group 
the oil companies which sell about 100 billion gallons of 
gasoline a year are quick to point out the drawbacks to alternative 
fuels methanol for example emits less carbon monoxide than 
gasoline but produces formaldehyde and other harmful poisons 
methanol is highly corrosive so a cars fuel tank and the entire 
fueldelivery system must be made of a corrosionresistant material 
such as stainless steel 
engines running on compressed natural gas produce almost no soot 
and less carbon monoxide nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons than 
gasoline engines do but some experts worry that greatly increased 
use of natural gas would deplete the existing surpluses and could 
lead to greater reliance on middle eastern energy suppliers

the big three automakers said tuesday backseat 
lap and shoulder belts already are in place for many 1989 models and 
will be in all required 1990 models 
none of the companies would say how much the additional safety 
measure ordered monday by the national highway traffic safety 
administration for all 1990 hardtop cars will cost consumers 
the center for auto safety in washington estimated that kits for 
installation of the belts in existing cars cost 200 and up 
weve seen a transition from two decades ago from a period of 
little or no public acceptance in safety devices to an era where 
safety is perceived as a plus in most cases and the price of entry 
in all others said bill day a ford motor co spokesman in 
washington 
ford offers standard rear lap and shoulder belts on 34 percent of 
its 1989 cars including the taurus and cougar 
general motors corp has offeed rear lap and shoulder belts since 
1987 they are standard in all but two 1989 gm models the full size 
chevrolet blazer and the geo spectrum 
we were well ahead of the rule gm spokeswoman antonette 
simonetti said 
she said gm offers kits allowing installation of the rear 
shoulder belts but she could not say how popular they are 
james kenyon a chrysler corp spokesman said several chrysler 
models have the rear belts for 1989 including the dodge 
shadowplymouth sundance series and the eagle summit 
there is going to have to be some redesign work to accommodate 
this ruling but we are looking to have rear shoulder belts for the 
1990s kenyon said 
he added that a retroactive installation kit from chrysler will 
be available in august 
debra barclay a spokeswoman for the center for auto safety in 
washington said the agency has criticized gm for declining to offer 
kits for several models between 1978 and 1988 
the national highway traffic safety administration which is part 
of the department of transportation told the center gm was within 
its rights not to offer retroactive rear belt kits for some models 
barclay said anchors for permit installation of rear belts have 
been on all us cars since 1972 
she said consumer awareness of the availability of rear belt kits 
is limited many dealers she said are reluctant to offer them 
because of possible liability in case they dont protect a back seat 
passenger in an accident 
the prices of the kits often are inflated by dealerships she 
said 
simonetti said gms retroactive belt kits cost 50 to 60 
barclay said kits for older models begin in the 200 range and cost 
up to 300 for newer models

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade supported by a bullish 
agriculture department crop report and expectations for drier 
weather in the corn belt 
in a report issued after the close of trading monday the usda 
peggged the droughtdamaged winter wheat crop at an 11yearlow of 
141 billion bushels down 10 percent from last years harvest and 2 
percent below the may forecast 
the report gave a boost to the wheat market but buying 
enthusiasm was tempered by forecasts for drierthannormal 
conditions early next week in the great plains which would 
accelerate the winter wheat harvest 
the soybean market regained nearly all of the ground it lost 
monday amid talk of warm dry weather forecast for the midwest late 
this week and through the weekend those predictions also supported 
the corn market 
but some analysts said the strong soybean rally was inspired more 
by technical factors than weather forecasts 
i think the market was a little oversold going into todays 
session after the last couple sessions losses said mark weidner 
a soybean market analyst with cargill investor services inc in 
chicago 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 392 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 3 cents higher with july at 253 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 
3 cents higher with july at 161 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents 
to 10 cents higher with july at 701 a bushel

president carlos salinas de gortari said 
tuesday that renegotiation of mexicos debt with private banks may 
take months to complete 
as late as last week there was informed speculation that so much 
progress was being made in the negotiations that a final agreement 
could be reached in two to three weeks 
but in an interview with executives and members of the associated 
press salinas said there are still weeks maybe months ahead in 
the negotiations 
he said the talks with private banks are the toughest part of the 
debt renegotiation banks look at their balance sheets and we have 
to respond to social pressures he said 
some 500 commercial banks hold about 74 billion of mexicos 
1074 billion total foreign debt which is the secondlargest in 
the developing world after brazil 
mexico is attempting to renegotiate its bank agreements to cut 
its payment burden and help revive its economy 
salinas said mexico must cut its debt service from 7 percent to 2 
percent of gross domestic product to revive the longstagnant 
economy 
the president also reiterated his objections that debtforequity 
swaps where lenders exchange outstanding debts for equity in local 
enterprises generate inflation and damage the economy 
he said mexico wants additional foreign investment and would 
welcome foreign capital in infrastructure projects including 
telecommunications dams and roads 
the salinas administration is trying to encourage foreign 
investment by cutting red tape and opening up new sectors of the 
economy to foreign capital 
salinas said he is pleased the international monetary fund and 
the world bank are supporting mexicos efforts to restructure its 
foreign debt 
he said he is confident we will arrive at a satisfactory 
solution with the private lenders but it will still take some 
time 
the bank of mexico has not released any figures on foreign 
reserves since the end of 1988 but they are believed to be low some 
experts say they will not cover the debt payments coming due in the 
next few months 
there is not much time salinas said 
the social pressures on the sevenmonthold salinas 
administration are intense the president said real wages in mexico 
had dropped 50 percent since 1982 and a solution to the debt problem 
was needed to prevent social unrest 
when asked about the use of debtforequity swaps salinas said 
they lead to increasing liquidity in the economy and cause 
pressure on prices leading to greater inflation and the need for 
increasing government subsidies 
inflation is worse than stagnation he said 
salinas a harvardeducated economist devised mexicos 
successful antiinflation program while serving as budget minister 
to his predecessor miguel de la madrid 
while stressing the need for economic growth salinas said 
growth by itself will not be enough mexico needs clean 
growth which respects the environment he said 
mexico city and the countrys other major industrial centers are 
considered to be among the worlds most polluted cities

the european economic community will 
soon adopt a single license for banks operating in the 12nation 
trading bloc the european commissioner for financial services said 
tuesday 
we have made enormous progress in the last few days sir leon 
brittan said in a briefing with reporters 
brittan said he expects the regulations which would allow ec 
banks to operate across their borders to pass within a month 
but the licensing proposal has raised controversy because of its 
socalled reciprocity clause 
some ec members worried that foreign banks might be excluded from 
operating in the community unless eec banks were given equivalent 
advantages abroad 
sir leon amended the proposal earlier this year under the 
changes the eec would open negotiations with countries whose 
banking regimes were less liberal than its own but wouldnt 
systematically suspend an application by a foreign bank while it 
reviews access to the foreign banks home country

the chicago mercantile exchange said tuesday it 
has fined two traders a total of 175000 for making improper trades 
of stockindex futures during the week of the 1987 stockmarket 
crash 
the exchange said michael p walsh and paul f carbonaro 
prearranged six separate trades of standard amp poors 500 
stockindex futures contracts from oct 16 through oct 22 1987 
the trades involved a total of 94 contracts for future deliveries 
of the stocks tracked by the closely watched sampp 500 index 
walsh president of the spike trading co was fined 75000 and 
suspended from trading for 20 business days beginning tuesday 
carbonaro a floor broker was fined 100000 and suspended from 
trading for 30 business days beginning friday 
a receptionist at spike trading said walsh was not in a clerk 
for carbonaro said he was too busy to come to the telephone 
the penalties follow months of questioning by congress about the 
futures industrys ability to regulate itself scrutiny of the 
industry has intensified since the revelation in january that an fbi 
investigation of futures trading in chicago was under way 
the mercs compliance department reportedly began investigating 
walsh shortly after the oct 19 1987 stockmarket crash 
the wall street journal reported monday that an internal 
department memo dated nov 9 1987 indicated the exchange launched 
an investigation because during the period october 1923 1987 
walsh made over 25 million trading stockindex futures 
stockindex futures trading has been singled out as a factor that 
may have accelerated the stock markets collapse although futures 
exchanges have disputed that notion 
walsh was fined 1500 last november for unbusinesslike conduct 
in the trading pit he was fined 1000 in 1984 for use of undue 
force while entering or leaving the stockindex futures pit

steve jobs pulled off another coup when he 
landed a 100 million investment for his tiny company next inc 
from giant japanese electronics firm canon inc analysts said 
tuesday 
i definitely think that its an excellent deal for next said 
bruce lupatkin an analyst with hambrecht amp quist inc of san 
francisco its an extraordinary valuation thats being paid 
canon a manufacturer of camera and office equipment invested 
100 million for a 1667 percent stake in next pushing the market 
value for the 4yearold palo alto company to about 600 million 
the canon payment announced monday is considered extremely high 
for a company that still is not shipping its first product in 
significant volume something that worried some analysts 
we have to see how good next is its not clear that they have 
the winning product said david wu an analyst with sg warburg 
of new york 
the deal includes a separate agreement under which canon will 
become the exclusive distributor of next computer workstations in 
japan and eight other asian countries and follows another jobs coup 
in march whereby businessland inc of san jose said it would 
distribute nexts computers to businesses 
obviously businessland and canon are betting that next will 
deliver the product said laura lederman an analyst with duff amp 
phelps of chicago theyre betting that that product will perform 
to expectations and theyre betting on steve jobs 
jobs 34 who cofounded apple computer but left following a 
power struggle in 1985 first displayed nexts sleek black 
workstation in october when he offered it for sale to colleges and 
universities beginning at 10000 
he abruptly switched marketing tactics when he decided to include 
sales to businesses in the deal with businessland a leading 
computer retailer with 112 outlets nationwide 
the market for workstations highpowered desktop computers is 
expected to grow at a 30 percent clip through 1993 for total 
revenues of about 18 billion according to dataquest inc the san 
jose calif research firm 
hewlettpackards recent acquisition of apollo computer inc made 
it the no 1 player in the workstation market followed by sun 
microsystems according to dataquest other major players in the 
workstation market besides next include digital equipment corp 
and apple computer inc 
analysts said the canon deal was impressive because next did not 
give cannon any technology or manufacturing rights and the 
additional cash will allow next to complete its manufacturing 
facility and begin full production of its computer 
canon cannot expand its stake in next beyond 20 percent for the 
next 10 years only jobs with 50 percent and next employees with 
20 percent have a bigger ownership in the company texas 
billionaire h ross perot owns 125 percent of next 
hiroshi tanaka senior managing director of tokyobased canon 
said monday that his company made the investment because we feel 
that next will be the most important unix workstation company 
worldwide and that it is in our mutual interest to do all we can to 
strengthen our longterm relationship

us sprint communications co the no 3 carrier expects to offer 
direct dialing by buying room on atampt circuits spokeswoman terri 
dunn said 
the number of circuits between the united states and soviet union 
will increase as part of atampts agreement making it easier for 
calls to go through 
the exact date for resumption of direct dialing to moscow has not 
been set atampt said direct dialing is usually cheaper but 
wallerstein said he could not comment on the price before atampt made 
a rate filing 
calls to other parts of the soviet union will continue to require 
an operator although atampt is discussing expansion of direct dialing 
to more cities with the soviet ministry of posts and 
telecommunications direct dialing was available for part of 1981 to 
kiev leningrad tallinn and minsk 
atampt has provided telephone service to the soviet union since 
1943 
the only countries to which atampt provides no phone service are 
vietnam cambodia north korea and albania wallerstein said

president bush today vetoed 
legislation raising the minimum wage to 455 an hour setting up a 
political battle with the democratic majority in congress 
this bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive 
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities bush 
said in a veto message that ran more than 1500 words 
it would damage the employment prospects of our young people 
and least advantaged citizens he said it would accelerate 
inflation it would not help those in poverty and thus it would 
fail to properly reflect the thought behind this measure to help 
our lowest paid workers 
house speaker thomas s foley said the house would attempt to 
override the veto on thursday and that he would work through the 
night trying to sway democrats who voted against the measure when it 
cleared the house earlier this year 
hope springs eternal was all foley would say when asked if 
he had any evidence that he could swing the 30 or so votes democrats 
would need to pick up in the house in order to override a veto 
in the unlikely event the house voted to override it still 
appears that bush would emerge victorious thirtyfive gop senators 
have signed a letter pledging to support bush on a veto fight 
foley and senate majority leader george mitchell said democrats 
would quickly advance another minimum wage bill if bush prevails in 
the veto fight 
bush said that if congress is unwilling to accept his approach 
toward raising the minimum wage he would examine the possibility of 
raising the earned income tax credit to help the working poor 
the credit a portion of which is available for families with 
incomes up to 18576 is aimed at offsetting part of social 
security taxes paid by the working poor it can be worth up to 874 
a year a family can gain the full benefit even if its tax liability 
is less than the credit 
bush had said in advance that he would veto the legislation and 
he wasted no time doing so 
the bill was received at the white house at 1 pm edt and bush 
signed the veto message just 55 minutes later aboard air force one 
en route from wyoming to lincoln neb 
the bill sent to the white house called for a 455 hourly 
minimum wage by october 1991 while bush offered to go to 425 in 
january 1992 
the administration and congress also differ over whether 
employers should be able to pay newly hired workers a subminimum 
wage during a training period bush has said such a provision is 
vital to prevent massive job losses and proposed that employers be 
allowed to pay a subminimum wage to all new workers for up to six 
months regardless of prior work experience 
democrats initially resisted any such provision but included in 
their final bill a clause allowing a subminimum to be paid to 
workers with less than two months work experience 
i wish to be clear about this bush said in his veto message 
my difference with the congress is not just about 30 cents an 
hour it is about hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be 
preserved by my administrations approach as opposed to those that 
would be sacrificed under the excessive increase included in this 
legislation 
white house aides have been preparing for the veto chief of 
staff john sununu told reporters earlier today in wyoming that the 
measure will come to the white house hit the wall and bounce back 
like a rubber ball 
sununu said with a laugh this may be the first faxed veto in 
history 
it was an apparent reference to the legislation being sent via 
fax machine from the capitol to the white house 
democratic leaders were caught off guard by the swiftness of the 
veto they had called a news conference to ask bush one last time 
not to veto the measure and two had printed statements urging bush 
to reconsider 
i deeply regret that the president has chosen to veto this 
bill so important i think to the millions and millions of working 
men and women in the united states who deserve a living wage 
foley told reporters 
added senate majority leader george mitchell it is 
particularly offensive to millions of poor working americans that 
president bush would veto a bill over 30 cents an hour at the same 
time that he is pushing hard to give a 30000 a year tax cut to the 
very richest americans

the stock market finished broadly lower today 
amid concerns that a robust dollar could undermine corporate profits 
a weakening in bond prices acted as a catalyst for the selloff in 
stocks and encouraged investors to prune their holdings of shares on 
which they had made substantial profits in recent weeks 
also motivating sellers was a desire to make certain profits 
before the government reports a string of potentially marketmoving 
economic statistics later this week 
among the reports scheduled for release are ones on april 
merchandise trade and may industrial production on thursday and may 
consumer prices and housing starts on friday 
wall street analysts expressed worries about the adverse impact a 
highflying dollar might have on earnings of exportoriented and 
multinational companies these concerns surfaced despite a pullback 
in the dollar today 
previously investors had been concentrating on the benefits a 
strong dollar could bestow on the stock market by drawing in foreign 
money 
waves of program selling temporarly hit the market when stock 
index futures contracts dropped encouraging arbitragers to buy 
futures and sell stocks the impact was limited however and share 
prices managed to bob back up a bit from the lowest levels of the 
session

the international coffee organization cut export 
quotas for some producers tuesday after talks aimed at extending the 
present pricesupport pact collapsed and prices crashed 
the reduction was automatically triggered by a fall in the 
organizations indicator price of coffee below 115 a pound 
the price is the absolute floor the 74nation body seeks to 
defend by its pricesupport regime of export quotas which expires 
sept 30 the coffee organization indicator price tuesday was 
11463 
the organization cut the quota by 350700 bags which reduces the 
global quota allocation for the year october 1988 to september 1989 
to 5687 million bags one bag equals 132 pounds 
it was the third cut in quotas this year and like the others 
affects only producers of the poorer robusta bean the main burden 
falls on the ivory coast uganda and indonesia 
the selective application of quota cuts reflects the coffee 
organizations aim in the 198889 year to boost supplies of 
topquality arabica produced throughout latin america 
but quotas of producers of this type will be cut if the price of 
the grade drops below 130 a pound from its present level of 139 
the organization said 
negotiations between producing and consuming nations on a 
oneyear extension of the pact allowing prices to be stabilized by 
supply controls collapsed in confusion early tuesday 
brazil colombia all african producers the philippines and the 
european economic community backed a proposal at the nineday talks 
to extend the pact from oct 1 leaving details such as shares of 
the global export quota to be worked out before then 
the move was opposed by the 11nation group of producers of the 
topquality and increasingly popular mild arabica coffee including 
mexico costa rica honduras el salvador guatemala peru ecuador 
and india 
they proposed that an extension should be conditional on an 
agreement now that they would receive a bigger slice of the export 
quota market than at present the united states the biggest coffee 
consuming nation supported the proposal 
the nations agreed to hold a oneday session here july 3 to vote 
on the two proposals delegates said unless many nations change 
position both proposals are expected to be rejected they said 
in that event the coffee organization is expected to extend the 
present pact without its powers to regulate supplies and prices 
said the head of the west german delegation hugo roerig 
traders fear that producing countries will ignore coffee 
organization sales limits before oct 1 if no export quotas are 
adopted 
analysts said there are ample world supplies of coffee beans 
despite two consecutive poor brazilian crops huge stocks of coffee 
are also believed to be held in european warehouses

one of the 11 authors hired by whittle 
communications to write brief hardcover books that will contain 
advertising said tuesday he has withdrawn from the project because 
of editorial interference 
edward jay epstein had been signed to write a book about michael 
milken the former drexel burnham lambert inc executive who was a 
pioneer in developing the junk bond market 
the book was one of several that whittle plans to publish in what 
it is tentatively calling its larger agenda series for 
distribution to government and corporate leaders the books will run 
about 100 pages each and be sponsored by a single company which 
whittle has refused to identify 
however federal express corp of memphis has confirmed it 
intends to be a sponsor of the books 
epstein recently submitted an outline of his book but said 
whittle editor anthony kiser expressed concern about whether 
whittles audience would like the line of argument he was advancing 
the author said he didnt feel comfortable with the kinds of 
editorial suggestions being made by the editorial director there 
he declined to go into what was being suggested and said he had no 
way of knowing the reasons for demanding the changes 
but epstein said he had never run into such problems in writing 
11 other books with six different publishing companies in which no 
advertiser was involved in the project 
william rukeyser editorinchief at whittle communications said 
the advertiser had nothing to do with suggestions about epsteins 
book outline 
it was entirely an editorial process said rukeyser a former 
managing editor at fortune magazine adding he was outraged 
anyone would suggest an advertiser was interfering 
he seemed to be proposing a book that would take the view that 
michael milkens overall effect on the economy has been so healthy 
the fact that he may have committed felonies didnt matter we felt 
that was not an intellectually or morally viable stance for the book 
to to take he said 
milken has been indicted on federal securities fraud charges and 
could face a trial next year 
federal express spokeaman armand schneider said from memphis that 
the company has no editorial control over the books 
the content is up to whittle we know the names of the authors 
and the working titles but thats all he said 
rukeyser said he did not think epsteins withdrawal from the 
project would affect whittles broader plans for singleadvertiser 
books 
whittle disclosed earlier this year it signed book contracts with 
nine authors including epstein john kenneth galbraith and david 
halberstam 
the new york times which disclosed epsteins withdrawal from the 
project in tuesdays editions said halberstam and another project 
author james atlas told the newspaper they had not experienced any 
interference in their books 
rukeyser said two more authors he declined to identify have since 
been signed the first book could appear later this year with 
additional books expected in 1990

central banks helped push the dollar lower 
tuesday as the us government reported the deficit in its broadest 
measure of foreign trade worsened dramatically in early 1989 
the trade deficit did not directly contribute to the weakness in 
the dollar because the figures had been expected but some 
economists believe the huge gap in trade inevitably will halt the 
dollars earlysummer rally 
i dont believe this dollar rally can be sustained for more 
than a few weeks more than a month or two said charles taylor 
an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in washington 
americans are buying far more from overseas than they sell to 
foreign customers that can continue only while foreigners are 
willing to pile up credits in the form of loans and investments in 
the united states 
the commerce department said the deficit in the current account 
jumped 7 percent in the first quarter after falling the two previous 
quarters the current account covers merchandise trade as well as 
trade in services primarily investment income 
the dollar fell against all major currencies except the british 
pound which was weakened by speculation of a rift between prime 
minister margaret thatcher and her top economic official chancellor 
of the exchequer nigel lawson 
the pound finished the european trading day at its lowest level 
against the dollar in more than two years although action by the 
bank of england and a statement by mrs thatcher supporting lawson 
raised it from its lowest levels 
there were reports of dollar sales by the bank of japan bank of 
england bank of canada and the federal reserve the fed intervened 
five times according to jack adkins a currency analyst at refco 
group ltd in chicago 
in london the pound slipped to 15162 late tuesday that was 
the pounds lowest rate against the dollar since february 1987 late 
monday sterling cost 15250 in new york the pound traded at 
15270 down from 15285 on monday 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 030 yen to a closing 14870 yen later in london

coffee futures prices dropped to a 10month low tuesday amid 
fears the international coffee organizations failure to forge a new 
pricesupport pact could leave unroasted coffee free to fall to as 
low as 1 a pound 
on other markets orange juice futures rose sharply grains and 
soybeans advanced petroleum futures were mixed precious metals 
gained and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
coffee futures settled 475 cents to 946 cents lower on new 
yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery 
in july at 11538 the lowest close since aug 8 1988 
the price of coffee for july delivery in new york has dropped 
more than 11 percent since friday 
the loss of nearly 9 cents tuesday was nearly twice as large as 
the decline posted monday when it became apparent the worlds 
largest coffee producer and consumernations would end their 
nineday meeting in london without an agreement to replace the 
sixyear pact that expires on oct 1 
this has to be seen as followthrough from yesterdays 
selling said arthur stevenson a coffeemarket analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
the international coffee organization attempts to control coffee 
prices by limiting exports of green unroasted coffee from producer 
members to consumer members of the 74nation body 
one of the major stumbling blocks in london was a demand by some 
of the leading consumer nations including the united states for 
tighter restrictions on sales of coffee to nonico member nations 
such as the soviet union at prices below those charged to member 
nations 
traders fear that without a pricesupport mechanism coffee will 
flood the market and prices will collapse 
people are really talking up the 1 level said sandra kaul 
a shearson lehman hutton inc analyst in new york 
but she said the futures market may have overreacted to the 
failed london meeting noting that coffee inventories are relatively 
low and that brazil the worlds largest coffee is entering its 
coldweather season a damaging freeze in brazil could turn the 
market around in a hurry 
representatives of the international coffee organization will 
meet again july 3 no negotiations toward a new agreement are 
expected at that meeting but members could vote to extend the 
current pact 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures rallied strongly on the 
new york cotton exchange following five straight days of pronounced 
weakness analysts called the runup a technical correction to an 
oversold condition 
orange juice settled 75 cent to 695 cents higher with july at 
18025 a pound 
grain and soybean futures advanced on the chicago board of trade 
supported by a bullish agriculture department crop report and 
expectations for drier weather in the corn belt 
wheat settled cent to 3 cents higher with july at 392 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 252 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 161 a

crude oil for july delivery advanced slightly on the new york 
mercantile exchange but most other petroleum futures retreated amid 
signs of discord among opec members 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents lower to 8 
cents higher with july at 1934 a barrel heating oil was 60 cent 
to 87 cent lower with july at 4458 cents a gallon unleaded

kraft wont say what rocked its ready to 
roll game but the food giant may have to explain in court how 
more than 100 people wound up with winning game pieces for a one 
and only 17000 grand prize 
weve declared the game null and void were still evaluating 
what our next step will be kathy knuth spokeswoman for kraft 
general foods group of philip morris said tuesday at the companys 
suburban chicago offices 
were telling people whove matched the pieces to go ahead and 
mail them in but we dont know what well do she said 
obviously we feel very badly about the situation 
apparently not as badly as some of krafts customers who filed a 
classaction lawsuit tuesday in cook county circuit court 
a promotional insert in sunday newspapers in the chicago and 
houston areas carried the right half of four game pieces for ready 
to roll 
specially marked packages of kraft cheese contained a left half 
and matched pairs could be redeemed for one of 8000 free packages 
of cheese one of 500 skateboards one of 100 bicycles or at odds 
of 15 millionto1 a 1990 dodge caravan le 
the problem is that instead of there being a limited number of 
winners almost all of the game pieces that went out with the cheese 
had winning pieces of one kind r another said knuth she would 
not say who put the game together 
attorney jay degroot whose firm filed the lawsuit tuesday 
declined to discuss it his law firm filed a classaction lawsuit 
three years ago when a mistake caused beatrice cos to cancel a 
promotion and won a 2 million settlement for 2400 players 
id be willing to go to court if only because i had to go into 
the garbage can to get mine said larry bernstein a dissatisfied 
customer who is not named in the lawsuit he explained that his 
7yearold son richard loves contests and his wife joyce had 
thrown out the game piece that came with the cheese to hide it from 
richard 
but we were looking through the paper sunday and she realized 
she had the matching half i called kraft and by the time they 
called me back i was told hundreds of people claimed the same 
thing bernstein said 
almost immediately kraft began recalling all the specially 
marked packages from store shelves in both the chicago and houston 
areas 
knuth declined to reveal any details about the promotion other 
than to say the companys position is that it cannot be held liable 
for the error 
it is so obviously unintentional she said 
but the illinois attorney generals office already has heard from 
50 angry customers said spokeswoman therese mcmahon and a private 
attorney who already has been contacted by one winner says the 
company may not be able to say oops and forget about it 
in breachofcontract matters like this you can defend 
yourself by saying the error was so obvious that the person who 
benefits from it should know said attorney james magee im not 
sure that will wash in this instance especially in front of a 
jury 
robert blashek executive vice president for ventura associates 
international a new yorkbased contest sweepstakes and 
gameplanning service rated the kraft mixup pretty bad as these 
things go 
but on the scale of foulups he added ive heard of worse 
the difference is that most of those dont reach the public

prices for gasoline and heating oil futures 
slipped tuesday partly reflecting trader fear of an increase in 
stockpiles of petroleum products 
the fear turned out to be unfounded however after the close of 
trading the american petroleum institute reported stockpiles of 
crude oil gasoline and other refined products all fell in the week 
ended friday 
on the new york mercantile exchange wholesale unleaded gasoline 
for july delivery fell 181 cents a gallon to 5992 cents after 
sliding 199 cents on monday wholesale home heating oil for july 
delivery dropped 087 cent to 4458 cents a gallon after a 158cent 
decline monday 
crude oil for july delivery edged up 8 cents to 1934 a barrel 
after falling 62 cents on monday however subsequent contract 
months moved lower tuesday 
andrew lebow an analyst with edampf man international futures 
inc said the downward momentum of monday carried over into 
tuesday partly over fear of what the api stockpile report would say 
the market had expected the report to indicate an increase in gas 
and heating oil he said 
but the api said crude stocks fell 291 million barrels to 34194 
million barrels last week gasoline stocks fell 941000 barrels to 
22013 million barrels and other distillates fell 423000 barrels 
to 9889 million barrels

the seabrook nuclear power plant began its 
first atomic chain reaction tuesday a pivotal event for a 6 
billion project vexed by years of delays cost overruns and protests 
that made it a focus of the nations antinuclear movement 
seabrook operators began a sustained nuclear fission reaction in 
the plants 100 tons of uranium fuel at 523 pm plant officials 
said 
completed in july 1986 seabrook received its federal lowpower 
license on may 26 a day after a federal appeals court declined to 
block the tests 
three faulty safety valves delayed initial atomic operations by 
about a week final preparations for the first fission reaction 
resumed monday 
then plant operators withdrew control rods from the reactors 
fuel core and slowly began diluting the boron concentration in the 
reactor coolant water boron absorbs neutrons preventing them from 
striking and splitting uranium atoms to release more neutrons 
triggering a chain reaction 
seabrook originally was planned for commercial operation in 1979 
a twin reactor was abandoned 25 percent complete both reactors 
initially were to have cost less than 1 billion 
protests since construction began in 1976 have resulted in more 
than 3200 arrests including 734 arrests in two days of civil 
disobedience earlier this month 
lowpower tests must be completed successfully before a nuclear 
power plant may operate commercially but before seabrook may win 
its fullpower license it also must gain final approval for 
evacuation plans for crowded nearby beaches and communities up to 10 
miles away 
massachusetts has six communities within 10 miles of seabrook but 
refuses to cooperate saying evacuation of the area is not feasible 
federal hearings are underway on evacuation plans seabrook has 
developed for massachusetts 
federal regulators say approved evacuation plans are not needed 
for lowpower operation because the tests pose minuscule safety 
risks 
seabrooks owners also may have to prove they are financially 
qualified to run the plant commercially lead owner public service 
co of new hampshire is under federal bankruptcy protection and 
some of the other 11 new england utilities with seabrook shares also 
face financial problems 
but the nuclear regulatory commission ruled in december that 
those troubles pose no safety problem for lowpower tests as long as 
the owners posted a bond to pay to decommission the reactor after 
the tests should it never operate commercially owners posted the 
bond last month 
critics had argued that seabrook should not be allowed to start 
the tests and become contaminated by radioactive materials before 
commercial operation is assured and dumps are available for the 
plants nuclear waste 
plant officials maintained that contamination would be minimal 
outside the reactor vessel however with the start of a fission 
reaction spent uranium fuel would be classified as highlevel 
radioactive waste 
political and technical problems have delayed construction of a 
national highlevel nuclear dump while new hampshire has been shut 
out of the nations three lowlevel dumps because it has not met 
federal deadlines for becoming responsible for its own radioactive 
waste

motorists will see a new round of gasoline 
price rises this summer and a supply squeeze that could lead to gas 
lines reminiscent of the 1970s a consumer group said tuesday 
a report on the summer gasoline outlook by buyers up a division 
of the advocacy group public citizen painted a grim picture for 
motorists and called on federal authorities to investigate the oil 
companies for possible price collusion 
we could see spot shortages in the form of gas lines by the 
beginning of august said christopher dyson director of research 
for buyers up and chief author of the report 
dyson said gasoline prices at the pump could rise as much as 10 
cents a gallon by the end of the summer adding to a price spiral 
this spring that triggered calls on capitol hill for the justice 
department to investigate oil company pricing tactics 
the energy department and many independent analysts said gasoline 
prices are not likely to rise more than 4 or 5 cents a gallon this 
summer in part because of a recent decline in prices for the crude 
oil from which gasoline is refined 
the government said it expects no shortages barring a major 
disruption of supplies 
the oil industrys main trade group the american petroleum 
institute issued a statement challenging the buyers up predictions 
we are confident that gasoline supplies from both domestic and 
foreign refineries will be adequate to meet the nations needs this 
summer the institute said barring some unforeseen crisis that 
affects supplies we do not anticipate a shortage of gasoline or a 
return of lines at retail outlets 
prices jumped by about 15 cents a gallon following the march 24 
exxon oil spill in alaska which caused a brief squeeze on oil 
supplies to the west coast the industry blamed the price rise on 
normal seasonal increases in gasoline demand new environmental 
standards for gasoline and higher crude oil prices 
in the lengthy report on the gasoline situation buyers up said a 
supply squeeze is likely because oil refiners will be unable to meet 
growing demand for fuel this is due to a combination of factors 
including oil company efforts to sell more highoctane gasoline 
which result in less gasoline produced per barrel of oil 
the group also cited inadequate surplus stocks and a likelihood 
that imports will be more limited than in the past mainly because 
of production constraints in western europe 
even an optimistic assessment of the situation raises the 
possibility of gas lines this summer said joan claybrook 
president of public citizen 
the report said gasoline supplies would be the tightest since the 
energy crisis of the 1970s despite relatively abundant world oil 
supplies 
the authors called for increased regulation of the oil industry 
and called on the federal trade commission and the justice 
department to investigate possible illicit oil company 
cooperation to limit domestic supplies of gasoline

engines that run on a mixture of fuels could help 
the country switch from gasoline to the methanol auto fuel advocated 
by president bush for helping cut air pollution engineers at a ford 
motor co seminar said tuesday 
automakers have been testing methanolfueled vehicles for about 
10 years but the cars have relatively short driving ranges and fuel 
availability generally is limited to cities where test programs are 
in effect said donald r buist fords director of automotive 
emissions and fuel economy 
a flexible fuel system that could burn methanol gasoline or 
any mix of the two could make it easier to find fuel which also 
would ease consumer worriers about buying a methanolpowered car and 
being unable to use or sell it anywhere but cities experimenting 
with that fuel engineers said 
included in the broad environmentalpackage bush announced monday 
is a phasedin requirement for auto manufacturers to produce 
alternatives to gasolinepowered autos in the nine major urban areas 
with the worst smog problems 
gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone 
that causes smog methanol emits less carbon monoxide than gasoline 
but produces formaldehyde and other poisons 
fords current methanol testing program includes a 700car fleet 
in smoggy los angeles 
methanol has about half the energy content as the same volume of 
gasoline so the drivers going to have to refuel twice as 
often buist said it was unclear how commerciallyproduced 
methanols cost would compare with gasoline he said 
methanol an alcohol derived from natural gas coal or wood also 
is more corrosive than gasoline so engineers must develop fuel 
systems that can withstand it 
rewards will include some increase in performance along with the 
lower emissions of smogforming pollutants the ford engineers said 
david l kulp another in a group of ford officials holding a 
seminar for reporters on environmental and energy issues said a 
multifuel system would have a sensor that measures the 
methanolgasoline mix 
the sensor would be connected to the cars enginecontrol 
computer which adjusts spark timing and the flow of fuel 
general motors corp has a variable fuel control system 
designed to do the same thing on a fleet of 2220 cars being 
supplied to the california energy commission for a methanol 
demonstration program 
ford also will supply 2000 to 2500 cars with similar fuel 
controls for testing in a planned twoyear program in the los 
angeles area said buist who serves on an advisory panel on 
alternative fuels in california

prudential securities group said tuesday it has 
agreed to acquire the parent of the brokerage concern thomson 
mckinnon securities inc in a deal that could create the nations 
thirdlargest brokerage operation 
terms of the deal were not disclosed 
executives of the two concerns said the deal would result in 
operating efficiencies that will improve profitability and enable 
the resulting company to serve its clients better 
george ball head of prudential securities and its 
prudentialbache securities inc unit said the deal underscores 
our commitment to the retail securities business which has sagged 
since the october 1987 stock market crash 
the companies plan to merge the domestic retail brokerage 
operations of thomson mckinnon with those of prudentialbache 
securities into a retail brokerage arm to be called 
prudentialbachethomson 
ball said in an interview that the new brokerage would compete 
with dean witter reynolds inc for ranking as the nations 
thirdlargest brokerage concern behind those run by shearson lehman 
hutton inc and merrill lynch amp co 
the proposed transaction was announced jointly by ball and by j 
ronald morgan chairman and chief executive of thomson mckinnon 
inc who will become a vice chairman of the combined firm 
prudential securities is owned by the prudential insurance co of 
america 
thomson mckinnon is privately held owned by its management its 
employee stock ownership trust and by the hartford insurance unit of 
itt corp 
in a separate development hartford said it had agreed to sell 
its 23 percent stake in thomson mckinnon to the securities firm in 
advance of the prudential deal 
prudential agreed under terms of its agreement to acquire the 
outstanding thomson shares from the thomson management and the 
employee trust 
the statement said the price could not be stated because it is 
subject to adjustments and earnings through the closing date 
the deal is subject to a due diligence review and regulatory 
approvals 
the employee trust and prudential securities will each have about 
a 285 percent interest in the thomson mckinnon asset management lp 
57 percent of which is currently owned by thomson mckinnon the 
partnership operates thomsons money and investment management 
business 
the partnership went public in 1987 and its limited partnership 
units which comprise the remaining ownership will continue to 
trade on the new york stock exchange 
ball said in an interview that the retail securities business 
is very unpopular now but that prospects are brighter than 
they have ever been in the past the combined firm will be in 
position to prosper substantially as times do get better he said 
he said the shortterm catalyst for the deal was to cut down on 
overhead costs by allowing the two firms to share prudentials 
transaction processing operation 
this is going to help profitability in a period of drought in 
the retail business he said 
a longerterm benefit ball said would be increased capacity to 
create new products capture market share and advertise in a way 
that would help brokers and clients at both firms 
the new firm will have about 20000 employees and 13 billion in 
capital the companies said 
thomson mckinnon established in 1885 claims to be the 9th 
largest retail brokerage network with 154 offices worldwide and 
about 4700 employees including 2000 retail brokers 
prudentialbache currently ranks fourth among the brokerages with 
over 320 retail commodity investment banking and institutional 
sales offices worldwide and more than 16000 employees including 
over 6000 retail brokers

a delaware judge tuesday upheld a july 26 
shareholder meeting for prime computer inc denying a request by 
mai basic four inc to force its takeover target to hold its annual 
meeting wednesday 
meanwhile prime which is attempting to thwart the mai basic 
takeover bid by finding a friendly buyer reported in court 
documents it is currently in discussions with several fortune 
500size companies and two wellestablished leverage buyout firms 
the document said companies with which prime is negotiating have 
asked that their identities remain secret 
in his decision tuesday chancery court judge maurice a hartnett 
3rd rejected mai basics argument that delaware law compelled prime 
to hold a shareholders meeting every 13 months the california 
computer company had said the law compelled prime to hold the 
meeting wednesday 
hartnetts fivepage decision said the directors had sufficient 
reason to postpone the meeting until july 
in a letter to the court mai basic attorney michael goldman said 
primes move to postpone the meeting was a deliberate attempt by 
the prime board to prevent us from completing our offer 
hartnett said mai basic which is controlled by investor bennett 
s lebow had failed to submit sufficient evidence to support that 
allegation 
prime in a statement from its natick headquarters late tuesday 
said the directors had postponed the meeting in order to permit 
the stockholders to evaluate the new and much less attractive offer 
from basic and in order to give the directors reasonable time to 
find alternatives to basics new offer 
on june 1 tustin califbased mai basic lowered its original 
20pershare cash offer to 1950 per share for 75 percent of 
primes stock and notes for the remaining 25 percent 
primes management said the true value of the offer declined from 
13 billion cash to 975 million in cash plus junk paper 
prime chief executive anthony l craig said the company is 
continuing active discussions with several potential purchasers 
all of whom need additional time to consider their bids and arrange 
financing

monaghan has resigned as president of the fast food empire saying 
he wants to serve the church instead of serving up more than 2 
billion worth of pizza a year 
monaghan told thousands of dominos employees via closedcircuit

i love the daytoday work at dominos but i want to serve the

monaghan who owns the detroit tigers baseball team and is known

the house will test the possibility of raising 
taxes to cover 100 billion savings and loan losses as an 
alternative to borrowing the money 
up to now the only live alternatives being considered for 
financing the bailout had been swelling the federal deficit or a 
complex highcost offbudget bond scheme proposed by president bush 
with the sampl bill scheduled to reach the house floor on wednesday 
after four months of work the house rules committee on tuesday 
agreed to let lawmakers vote on three financing alternatives as well 
as separate measures to weaken and toughen bushs proposed 
regulatory reforms 
efforts to pay for the bailout through a tax increase or massive 
cuts in domestic spending programs were defeated soundly in the 
house ways and means committee and were never even formally 
considered by the senate 
and administration officials have repeatedly vowed to recommend 
that bush veto the bill if congress adopted anything other than his 
proposal to finance the 50 billion immediate taxpayer share of the 
cleanup through 30year private bonds 
in a statement issued soon after the rules committee action 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said we strongly urge the house 
to reject any amendments that would weaken the capital standards 
only tangible captial real hard cash provides the deposit 
insurance fund and the taxpayers with protection necessary to ensure 
a thrift crisis never happens again 
and onbudget borrowing to pay for the bailout is a grave 
mistake and will affect markets in addition the administrations 
plan is the best method to lock up the thrift industry 
contribution 
the house ways and means committee citing a potential 45 
billion savings in lower interest costs to taxpayers over the next 
30 years wants to make bush borrow the money directly through the 
treasury but exempt the new debt from grammrudman deficitreduction 
targets 
brady and other administration officials have vigorously opposed 
that saying it would open the door for allowing other needs such as 
cleaning up nuclear wastes and the war on drugs to swell the deficit 
and eventually force a tax increase 
under the rules committees action tuesday house members will 
get to vote on rejecting bushs plan in favor of borrowing the money 
directly through the treasury 
but there also will be a vote on an amendment by rep john 
lafalce dny on refusing to exempt the bailout costs from the 
budget balancing targets 
if we adopt the lafalce amendment were going to have to raise 
taxes or cut spending said rep gerald solomon rny i dont 
think its going to pass but at least well get a good fair debate 
on the issue 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois and administration 
officials have conceded that they expect bushs financing scheme to 
go down to defeat on a partisan vote in the house 
but with senate democrats falling 12 votes short of what was 
needed to kill it in april the administration has hopes of 
prevailing when house and senate negotiators meet later to iron out 
differences in the two versions of the bill 
what remains uncertain is whether bushs call for making some 450 
marginally healthy thrifts put up 6 billion new capital over the 
next five years will survive without a major loophole socalled 
supervisory good will 
the administration and the house democratic leadership have 
agreed on graudally phasing out the good will exemptions from 
capital requirements over the next five years this allows sampls to 
count intangible assets such as customer allegiance name 
recognition and the like as if they had a cash value 
however all but about a dozen of the houses 175 republicans as 
well as several democrats from districts with sampls that would have 
difficulty coming up with the money were alligned on the other side 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash claimed support for 
bushs tough capital approach was sufficient to defeat weakening 
amendments by reps henry hyde rill and james quillen rtenn 
but rep chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking republican on the 
house banking committee and one of the few gop members alligned with 
democrats in supporting bushs approach said the industry has 
someone in from every members district in its lobbying effort 
against the bush proposals 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp the agency that will be responsible for cleaning up the sampl 
problems said the administration may lose some ground but theyre 
not going to lose the fight on the capital issue 
figures released tuesday by the federal home loan bank board the 
industrys main regulator show that the nations 2938 sampls 
actually have more good will exemptions from the capital 
requirements than actual tangible capital invested in their 
businesses

president daniel ortega announced pay 
raises of up to 50 percent for public employees on tuesday and 
accused businessmen of fueling inflation by speculating in dollars 
taxicab drivers stopped work on tuesday in managua and three 
other major cities leon granada and masaya to protest 
government measures that doubled the price of gasoline and devalued 
the national currency by half 
the austerity measures by the leftist sandinista government were 
aimed at combating inflation 
the cabbies who steered clear of calling their action a strike 
formed a panel that started negotiations with government officials 
over a list of demands 
on monday ortega ordered the sharpest currency devaluation so 
far this year causing prices to skyrocket the 52 percent 
devaluation brought down the cordoba nicaraguas currency from 
9500 to the us dollar friday to 20000 per dollar on monday 
that kicked off a massive rise in prices for everything from 
food and transportation to clothing services and entertainment 
food prices doubled and markets emptied cab drivers doubled 
their fares but found few takers 
ortega said tuesday that nicaragua will have to import basic 
foods in june and july and will further restrict the financing of 
investments 
he had announced on monday a 110 percent rise in the price of 
gasoline from 17700 cordobas a gallon to 37200 cordobas 
the president said then there would be no further devaluations in 
the cordoba this month he also said he hoped to halt black market 
speculation in dollars that he said fuels inflation 
bus fares on routes within managua went up from 500 to 750 
cordobas overnight and dozens of people on tuesday hitched rides 
from private car owners saying they couldnt afford the new fares 
most cabs emptied after the fares doubled 
sales also dropped in food markets after prices shot up following 
the devaluation 
ortega said the nations 43000 public school teachers and health 
workers will get a 50 percent pay raise to make up for losses to 
inflation teachers also will receive a 14 percent increase that 
ortega promised may 20 after several schools were shut down by 
wildcat strikes 
an additional 87000 government employees will receive a 36 
percent pay raises retroactive to june 1 ortega said 
speaking on government television ortega said businessmen were 
fueling cost of living increases by speculating in dollars 
over these last few weeks a great deal of money has been moving 
in the speculative markets and over the last few days there has 
been a massive withdrawal of savings in order to speculate he 
said 
inflation was 155 percent in may the cost of living rose 20000 
percent last year 
the government has said that an austerity program launched in 
january has checked hyperinflation but the program also brought a 
recession 
nicaragua traditionally a food exporter to the rest of central 
america will have to import basic foods such as tomatoes onions 
bananas and cabbages in june and july to make up for domestic 
shortages ortega said 
to stimulate production the government has been giving financial 
incentives to agricultural producers who began their seasonal 
plantings in may but lack of rain destroyed seeds already planted 
and many fields had to be planted again an extra expense the 
economy can ill afford

boeing 737400 jets similar to those involved in 
two recent engine failures should be grounded for engine 
modifications boeing co and engine manufacturer cfm international 
recommended tuesday 
on monday britains civil aviation authority grounded all 12 
boeing 737400s operated by british airlines after two of the jets 
experienced engine failure on tuesday west german officials 
ordered that the engines be checked on the four 737400 jets used in 
that country 
the jets all are powered by by cfm563c engines made by cfm 
international a consortium of snecma of france and general electric 
co of the united states 
the federal aviation administration was preparing an 
airworthiness directive instructing us airlines to inspect the fan 
blades on engines in their boeing 737400s and to operate them at a 
lower power thrust dave duff an faa spokesman in seattle 
confirmed monday that directive was expected to be issued by 
midweek 
recommendations from boeing and the engine manufacturer include 
replacing fan blades and lowering the maximum thrust to 22000 
pounds from 23500 pounds that current cfm563c engines provide a 
boeing statement said 
the recommendation affects 29 cfm563cpowered jets outside the 
united states and five in this country all five of the us jets 
are operated by usair t craig martin of boeing said tuesday 
boeings announcement was not made to try to head off the 
expected faa directive martin said 
we have been working very closely with the faa as well as with 
cfm martin said 
the cfm563c engine problems result when fan blades break at a 
very high rpm scattering parts into the engine martin said 
the engine failures on the british jets involved damage to fan 
blades the same model engine and plane also were involved in a 
fatal crash in january in britain 
on friday a danair 737400 carrying 100 charter passengers to 
minorca returned to londons gatwick airport after developing severe 
vibration in one engine 
on sunday a british midlands 737400 flying from londons 
heathrow airport to belfast northern ireland with 80 people aboard 
made an emergency landing at east midlands airport after a problem 
developed in one engine 
in both cases the airlines reported that turbofan blades had 
been damaged 
questions about the cfm563c engine arose in january after the 
crash of a british midlands boeing 737400 at east midlands airport 
that killed 47 people 
the pilot had reported that one engine failed in flight but 
investigators later found the planes good engine had been shut down 
before the emergency landing was attempted the investigation has 
not been completed
