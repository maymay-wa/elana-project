hundreds of new pupils have entered 
the battered classrooms of pace community college signaling the 
rebirth of a private high school that was once a showpiece of us 
investment in black education 
when pace opened in 1982 the 6million tan brick building 
gleamed like a wellendowed institution in a wealthy american 
suburb despite the grassy 22acre campus separating it from 
sowetos dirt streets and shabby bungalows the school now seems to 
belong to an innercity slum 
offering commercial studies as an alternative to sowetos rundown 
state schools pace suffered during the 198487 period of nationwide 
black unrest and school boycotts against apartheid militants 
advocating peoples education tagged pace as elitist politics 
and violence distracted the students and few passed their exams the 
school closed for several months 
principals came and went vandals invaded the building us 
companies that had built the school withdrew their support the 
staff served without pay and enrollment shrank 
as the new term began jan 25 the roof leaked and the telephone 
didnt work toilets and lockers were broken books chairs and 
teachers were scarce 
two derelict cars stood in the driveway weeds had grown 
waisthigh in the tennis courts a handwritten note taped on a 
classoom door recalled an extracurricular struggle dont push us 
turkeys cause youll never get away with it 
but pace has human assets wilkinson kambule 68 the new 
principal and lekgau mathabathe 63 chairman of a new school board 
composed entirely of soweto residents both were school principals 
in soweto in 1976 and from their schools came leaders of student 
riots against afrikaanslanguage instruction imposed by the 
whiteminority government 
both resigned to support the student protest kambule becoming a 
university mathematics teacher mathabathe joining a foodprocessing 
company 
kambule retains a reputation as an insirational teacher who gets 
results and his arrival at pace in mid1988 was particularly 
welcomed by sowetans 
parents have confidence children started coming back from 
private schools in johannesburg kambule said in an interview 
im budgeting for the full number of 600 students and ive had to 
send hundreds away 
some of paces us corporate backers have divested and left 
south africa but those that remain are showing renewed interest 
we no longer have any say in running the school but we have 
recommended to our members that they become involved financially 
again said adrian botha executive director of the american 
chamber of commerce in south africa one company has already 
appointed a fund raiser for pace 
students are required to pay only half their annual fees of 3000 
rand 1250 and company donations are expected to make up the 
balance mathabathe said pace needs 60000 rands 25000 a month 
to stay open and much more to renovate the building and increase 
salaries 
the school increasingly has encouraged community involvement 
civic groups use the gymnasium and the auditorium is rented out for 
church services wedding receptions and taxi drivers meetings 
but kambule emphasized that paces goal remains the same to 
provide a superior education to blacks seeking middlemanagement 
business jobs the first pace students to take final high school 
exams under kambules direction numbered only 55 but 31 passed by 
far the best percentage of any soweto school last year 
im interested in children setting out on their own for the 
future through education kambule said i tell them dont 
call me principal im your employee im in your service but 
theres lots of discipline 
he appears to have ended paces political isolation from sowetos 
young militants 
people have been asking for alternative education i explain 
that this is an alternative school kambule said 
politics in the school arent over the revolution is still on 
but they shouldnt treat us like they treat a government school 
kambule said he allowed a youth group to use the auditorium last 
year to celebrate the birthday of the imprisoned black leader nelson 
mandela 
they came to me afterward and said we didnt think youd let 
us i replied why not its your school

the president the military and the virgin of 
guadalupe used to be offlimits for mexican political cartoonists 
now only the generals and the virgin are taboo 
the best of mexicos cartoonists say what others cant or 
wont their razorsharp commentaries sparkle on gray pages awash in 
windy progovernment prose 
they are in the vanguard of free expression in mexico said 
carlos monsivais one of mexicos most outspoken acerbic social 
analysts they get away with things i never could 
the political ferment of 1988 a year of unprecedented losses at 
the polls for the ruling institutional revolutionary party sparked 
a wave of graphic daring 
more than one artist has depicted mexicos diminutive jugeared 
balding new chief executive carlos salinas de gortari as a 
disneyesque rodent named mickey 
they are tough very tough monsivais said approvingly 
although president salinas seems to be getting a bit more cartoon 
respect than he did as candidate and presidentelect 
jerry robinson head of the new yorkbased cartoonists and 
writers syndicate agrees that something special is afoot 
mexico has a fantastically high number of exceptional 
cartoonists said robinson who syndicates many of mexicos best 
they are highcaliber graphic artists it makes their work very 
very effective 
rogelio naranjos razorsharp pen has been on the cutting edge 
for years day by day stroke by ironic stroke naranjo has chiseled 
away at the pretensions foibles hypocrisies and taboos that have 
buttressed a oneparty government for 60 years hes honed a sixth 
sense for what he can get away with in his 22 years of political 
cartooning 
its like a mystical thing in my work i navigate the line that 
divides what is possible and what isnt he said when it comes to 
government policy now there are very few limits 
government austerity programs and mexicos crippling foreign debt 
provoke some of the bitterest commentary 
naranjo resorted literally to gallows humor depicting a plump 
man representing the world bank picking the pocket of a starved 
barefoot and hanged worker 
bulmaro castellanos who draws under the monicker magu showed 
salinas architect of an austerity pact that controlled wages and 
prices as a crazed workman armed with a chainsaw standing over a 
bloody body skewered by the pact 
the generals are another story both official censorship and 
selfcensorship have a long history in mexico where few care to 
rouse the military and endanger decades of civilian rule 
the army is the most taboo thing naranjo said everyone 
assumes the army is a great power in mexico that can influence the 
government in a radical and substantial manner 
as for the virgin of guadalupe even naranjo who has lampooned 
the pope says such a revered symbol cannot be used to make a point 
a museum exhibit that included irreverent paintings of mexicos 
patron saint was shuttered after a public outcry 
although most of their satire is directed at the ruling 
establishment the cartoonists do take occasional pokes at the 
opposition efren maldonado showed opposition leader cuauhtemoc 
cardenas as a giant head supported by a magic carpet in the image of 
former president lazaro cardenas cuauhtemocs father and a national 
hero 
cartoonists such as naranjo and helio flores began stretching the 
limits of the possible as founders of the cheeky humor magazine la 
garrapata in 1968 a year of political upheaval in much of the 
world including mexico 
the notion of reverence disappeared monsivais said 
in a show of impatience with the oneparty status quo thousands 
took to the streets the unrest lasted only a few months until the 
army opened fire on a demonstration in mexico city killing scores 
not long after the massacre la garrapata cofounder eduardo del 
rio who signs himself rius was kidnapped by uniformed men and 
forced to stand next to an empty grave in front of what turned out 
to be a mock firing squad 
subsequent administrations began slowly opening a safety valve 
that included tolerance for press freedom 
the mexican chief executive was traditionally above reproach no 
matter how unpopular even now maldonado the first cartoonist to 
put dumbo ears on salinas insists he intends no disrepect 
flores remembers a cartoon of president jose lopez portillo who 
left office to almost universal relief in 1982 he was drawn as 
hamlet but very very handsome very athletic flores said 
with salinas cartoonists have gone far beyond making fun of his 
ears and his austere economics attacking the very legitimacy of his 
presidency his election was marred by accusations of fraud and 
cardenas still claims that he won 
the most audacious cartoons appear in el universal a mainline 
newspaper that gave significant space to the opposition in 1988 and 
in two publications born after 1968 la jornada a liberal daily 
and the feisty weekly proceso 
but both naranjo and flores who just won his second gran prix 
from the international salon of cartoon say even el universal 
sometimes refuses a cartoon it considers too daring 
after the july 6 presidential election which many say the ruling 
party rigged flores did a sketch portraying salinas as dr 
caligari the eerie protagonist of a classic silent horror film 
el universal rejected it without explanation he said the 
cartoon later ran in an opposition paper

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference monday 
bush well for more than half a century the us has operated a 
deposit insurance program that provides direct government protection 
to the savings of our citizens 
this program has enabled tens of millions of americans to save 
with confidence 
in all the time since creation of the deposit insurance savers 
have not lost one dollar of insured deposits and i am determined 
that they never will 
deposit insurance has always been intended to be selffunded 
and this means that the banks the savings and loans and credit 
unions that are insured pay a small amount of their assets each year 
into a fund thats used to protect depositors 
in every case these funds are spent to protect the depositors 
not the institutions that fail 
for the last 20 years conditions in our financial markets have 
grown steadily more complex and a portion of the savings and loan 
industry has encountered steadily growing problems 
these financial difficulties have led to a continuous erosion of 
the strength of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
fslic 
economic conditions have played a major role in this situation 
however unconscionable risktaking fraud and outright 
criminality have also been factors 
because of the accumulation of loses at hundreds of these thrift 
institutions additional resources must be devoted to cleaning up 
this problem 
we intend to restore our entire deposit insurance system to 
complete health 
while the issues are complex and the difficulties manifold we 
will make the hard choices not run from them 
we will see that the guarantee to depositors is forever honored 
and we will see to it that the system is reformed comprehensively so 
that the situation is not repeated again 
to do this i am today announcing a comprehensive and 
wideranging set of proposals 
the secretary of the treasury nicholas brady will describe 
these proposals to you in detail in a few minutes 
however i think its important to summarize some of the major 
points 
the proposals include four major elements 
first currently insolvent savings institutions will be placed 
under the joint management of the fdic and fslic pursuant to 
existing law 
this will enable us to control future risktaking and to begin 
reducing ongoing losses 
second the regulatory mechanism will be substantially overhauled 
to enable it to more effectively limit risktaking 
the fdic would become the insurance agency for both banks and 
thrifts under this system although theres no comingling of funds 
the insurer will have the authority to set minimum standards for 
capital and accounting 
uniform disclosure standards will also be implemented 
the chartering agency for thrifts would come under the general 
oversight of the secretary of the treasury 
third we will create a financing corporation to issue 50 
billion in bonds to finance the cost of resolving failed 
institutions which will supplement approximately 40 billion that 
has already been spent 
all of the principal of these bonds and a portion of the interest 
on them will be paid from industry sources

however the balance would be paid from onbudget outlays of 
general revenues 
hopefully some of these revenues will be recovered in the future 
through sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers 
fourth we plan to increase the budget of the justice department 
by approximately 50 million to enable it to create a nationwide 
program to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoing 
in the management of these failed institutions 
these funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devoted 
to the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraud 
in our financial markets 
as you can see these proposals are based upon several overriding 
principles 
first i will not support any new fee on depositors 
second we should preserve the overall federal budget structure 
and not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loan 
executives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantly 
alter our overall budget priorities 
and third i have concluded that this proposal if promptly 
enacted will enable our system to prevent any repetition of this 
situation 
and fourth ive decided to attack this problem headon with 
every available resource of our government because it is a national 
problem 
ive directed that the combined resources of our federal agencies 
be brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem 
and fifth i believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real 
cost of providing the deposit insurance protection 
the price the fdic charges banks for their insurance has not been 
increased since 1935 
we propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7 
cents per 100 of insurance protection that they receive 
every penny collected would be used to strengthen the fdic so 
that the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few years 
from now 
and i make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to 
recover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behind 
bars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior 
let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at 
risk the savings of american families anticipate that we will seek 
them out pursue them and demand the most severe penalty 
in closing i want to just say a word to the small savers of 
america 
across this great land families and individuals work and save 
and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote a 
brighter future for our children 
your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits 
before 
it does today and it will do so at all times in the future 
every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and credit 
of the united states of america which means it will be that it 
will be absolutely protected 
for the future we will seek to achieve a safe sound and 
profitable banking system 
however integrity and prudence must share an equal position with 
competition in our financial markets 
clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy and 
to the public confidence that is its most important ingredient 
ive determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for your 
support in putting it behind us 
i have ordered that the resources of the executive branch be 
brought to bear on cleaning up this problem 
i have personally met with the leadership of congress on this 
issue 
my administration will work cooperatively with congress as the 
legislation that we will submit in a few days time is considered 
i call on the congress to join me in a determined effort to 
resolve this threat to the american financial system permanently 
and to do so without delay

i welcome the leaders that are with me here on this platform 
i think their support says a lot about the efficacy of our 
proposal 
and now i propose to take just a few questions 
on the technical aspects i will defer to these people and then 
ill be glad to turn this over to secretary brady 
i believe we start with helen and then terry and then get going 
q mr pesident are you guaranteeing that the extra costs 
premium increases and so forth will not be passed on to the 
depositors taxpayers and also what is your responsibility in this 
debacle i mean the reaganbush deal for deregulation of business 
and banking 
a on the first place were not guaranteeing that 
i would hope that wouldnt happen but theres no guarantee what 
the institutions will do 
secondly theres enough to be said for everybody in this 
together trying to solve this problem 
so i cant equate any personal im not inclined to go into any 
personal blame simply to say that weve got to solve this problem 
and were on the path to doing that 
yeah terry 
q mr president the house votes tomorrow on that controversial 
pay raise plan and the senate has already voted against it would 
you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise not only for the members 
of congress but also for federal judges and other high officials in 
the government 
a i said i support it 
yes 
q mr president there is a feeling that part of this problem is 
attributable to deregulation of the financial industry in 
retrospect do you think that deregulation might have gone too far 
in the last 10 years or so and in the future is your marching 
order to your administration to be a little more careful in 
regulating this particular industry 
a jerry i dont know the answer 
id be most interested to know what our experts here feel about 
whether how much of the problem could be attributed to 
deregulation 
i just dont know the answer to your question 
so i cant reply 
yes 
q mr president you have placed considerable stress in these 
early days of your presidency on ethics and propriety yet in recent 
days theres this controversy on capitol hill concerning the 
propriety of senator towers alleged behavior and questions raised 
over the weekend about the financial arrangements on the private 
funds of the man in charge of ethis your counsel boyden gray and 
other questions involving members of the administration or 
memberstobe of the administration and i wonder sir whats 
happened here is it too harsh behavior on our part too lax 
behavior on your part what 
a i dont think anything has happened 
i learned long ago in public life not to make judgments based on 
allegations 
but having said that i want to have my administration aspire to 
the highest possible ethical standards 
and we have appointed a commission to go out there now and try to 
detail what these standards should be 
and we are in a new era on these matters matters that might have 
been approved and looked at one way may have a different perception 
today 
and so what i want to do is finalize our standards and then 
urge everybody in all branches of government to aspire to those 
standards

but i do think rick that its fair that we not reach judgment 
on senate hearings before the senate hearings are concluded because 
its very hard to filter out fact from fiction spurious allegation 
from fact 
and i am not about to make a judgment based on a sensationalized 
newspaper story 
im simply not going to do that 
that wouldnt be fair and im not sure how ethical it would be 
so lets wait and see 
this youre referring to the tower matter up there 
that matter has been looked at by the fbi 
the committee now has that 
they have the responsibility to make determination 
and ill be very interested to see what they say 
but i am not going to make conclusions jump to conclusions 
based on stories that may or may not have any validity at all 
yes 
q mr president even if as your spokesman says you do you 
continue to back senator tower for the position there are those 
youve heard who say that the best thing he could do for you is to 
step aside because even if confirmed he then would become 
damaged goods weaker in administering a very very tough job 
on your behalf how do you respond to that suggestion 
a well i think people would not want a person to step aside 
given rumor particularly if the rumor is baseless 
and the process what the problem is the process is taking a 
little longer than i would like and yet i think the senate has got 
to do what theyre doing looking at these allegations very 
carefully 
but you know as i said here at this same podium a while back 
the american people are basically fair 
and if these allegations prove to be allegations without fact 
behind them i think the people are going to say wait a minute 
what went on here how come it was all this wed read this one 
day and then kind of a puff of smoke the next 
and so i dont think in your substantive question though that 
if it proves if the senate committee gives its endorsement to the 
senator particularly after all of these allegations that there is 
any danger at all of damage to his credibility or his ability to do 
the job 
yes 
q mr president there are new and substantive allegations that 
senator tower lost control over the highly classified security 
documents and computer disks that were used in geneva under his 
watch if those allegations prove to be founded would you then 
withdraw his nomination 
a i would not answer hypothetical questions of that nature 
youre telling me something that i havent heard before 
and we did have access to fbi reports 
so if this matter is now before the congress let them 
investigate it 
but i cant go into a hypothesis 
all i would be doing would be adding to i think speculation 
that is not helpful at this juncture 
q but sir will you pursue these allegations in the executive 
branch are you going to track what the fbi is looking into are you 
going to personally surveil these kinds of allegations yourself 
a every rumor and every innuendo no 
but if you make if theres some substantive allegation of this 
nature of course it would concern me 
yes 
q mr president back to sampls if we might millions 
laughter millions of americans save alternatively that is they 
put their funds in mutual funds stocks and that kind of thing as 
i read it youve now outlined a plan that places a lot of the sampl 
bailout on the backs of the general treasury how fair is that 
a weve got a major problem and something has to be done 
and this is the fairest system that the best minds in this 
administration can come up with 
and so id i again would ask you to ask the specifics of 
the treasury burden to the chairman of the federal reserve or the 
secretary of the treasury 
ask how they see that

but look as ive said there is no easy answer to this 
all i want to do is make a sound proposal work to put it into 
effect and have that proposal such that the country wont have to 
face this problem again 
yes dave 
q mr president you said you dropped the deposit fee idea but 
this plan youve given us has an increase in premimums that may be 
paid by consumers as well as a large amount of taxpayers money 
isnt that the same thing consumers and taxpayers are still going 
to have to pay the price for this 
a well as i indicated earlier on there is no guarantee of 
passing this on to the consumer nor is there a guarantee it wont 
be passed on 
but this arrangement has been there since for 50 years 
and you might argue whether its been passed on or not i just 
dont know i havent seen the flowthrough in the industry 
but nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of 
this magnitude 
yes 
q mr president youve talked to several members of congress in 
various receptions and dinners and personal conversations over the 
past couple of weeks in many of them you discussed your plan for 
this problem what is your feeling for the reception that its going 
to get on capitol hill and of the selling job that it will make you 
have to get it passed 
a we may have a big selling job 
but ive been encouraged so far with the spirit epitomized by the 
members of congress particularly at the joint leadership meeting 
the other day 
we didnt go into every detail of this these plans were still 
being formulated and i wanted to get their views 
i was encouraged by what bill seidman told me earlier on about 
how he what he felt the receptivity of the plan will be 
but i dont think its fair to the congress to say that they have 
signaled to me that they are going to be enthusiastic on this plan 
although i hope they are 
yes 
q mr president 
a im going to take about three more and then turn this over to 
these gentlemen here who are prepared to go into as much detail as 
you want 
yes 
q mr president on these allegations that surround tower now 
at least variations on the theme surfaced early in the transition 
allegations of womanizing and taking money from defense contractors 
that sort of thing have you satisfied yourself that he is still the 
nominee you want and can you give us at this time a wholehearted 
endorsement of tower 
a yes i can and i will right now because some of the very 
same allegations that were floated that long ago apparently have 
been looked at and examined by the best possible examiners im 
talking about the fbi and found to be groundless 
so therefore im not about to change my view 
now if somebody comes up with facts i hope im not narrowminded 
enough that i wouldnt take a look but i am not going to deal in 
the kinds of rumors that ive seen reported and then knocked down 
and then reported and then knocked down 
yes

tour of the presidential residence pretty grand huh 
in an interview with the associated press mrs bush said she 
felt right at home from the very first moment 
her husband she said is exactly the same and has not 
changed since moving up from vice president under ronald reagan 
however she said everyone else has changed and everybody treats 
you differently when youre president 
when youre vice president and certainly vice presidents wife 
you get away with many more things than you do when youre 
president mrs bush said everything you say becomes major and 
it is major he is the president of the united states 
she said her husband has an enormous job has he 
philosophized about it no but hes absolutely determined to do the 
best he can 
i see my job as trying to take some of that pressure off him 
mrs bush said 
i see that as my job to try to not talk about those 
problems and also do not talk when hes working i mean i think 
thats a big part of it she said 
because he knows with me i hope that he can curl up with his 
problems and study them and hes not going to have me badgering him 
about something else 
i really do not lobby george bush his wife said i dont 
lobby anyone 
a lot of people try to skirt regular channels and send letters 
intended for the president to mrs bush in hopes shell pass it on 
i just dont give them to him she said 
despite the intense demands of his office bush does not seem 
weighed down by the job his wife said 
i should tell you yes but no he sleeps like a baby she 
said because he knows hes human i mean hes been around the 
presidency so long that i think he really feels he can do the best 
job that can be done 
she said bush awakens every morning about 6 am and has coffee 
and juice in bed while reading morning newspapers about five in 
all and scanning the white house news summary he also watches 
morning television shows before leaving for the oval office about 7 
am 
mrs bush said the president returns to the residence between 6 
pm and 630 pm its so much earlier than when he was vice 
president because he doesnt have that drive home i mean its 
wonderful the first lady said 
describing a typical evening at home she said wed sit in our 
little room private room watch the television have dinner then 
hed go to his office and id go to mine probably 
most nights she said they use the china service from woodrow 
wilsons presidency but we can do anything we want isnt that 
fun 
she said bush as president is working exactly the same 
routine he followed as vice president i mean george bush was 
born i think on this schedule

yes he always has his wife said he does a lot of 
reading and he does an awful lot of personal writing he brings 
home mail works on it he gets his little briefcase sent up ahead 
full of work

night the president suffering from what mrs bush said was the 
flu was asleep at that moment

affordable housing the minimum wage and other 
issues not tied directly to fighting racial bias are moving onto the 
shopping list of civil rights forces as they gear up for the 
postreagan era on capitol hill 
the traditional notion of what a civil rights bill is is sort 
of going through a change says jane ogrady a labor official and 
legislative chairwoman of the leadership conference on civil rights 
issues that civil rights advocates group under the heading of 
economic justice often dealing with labor and welfare are 
prominent on the list 
civil rights for the disabled legal services for the poor and 
mandatory leave from work for parents of newborns and sick children 
are all priorities for the leadership conference an umbrella group 
that takes in virtually the entire civil rights community 
the new emphasis represents not so much a change in direction as 
a return to issues that were largely ignored while civil rights 
forces skirmished with the reagan administration throughout much of 
the 1980s 
not all of the new priorities are economic for example civil 
rights advocates continue to press for easier voter registration and 
they are preparing to fight englishonly legislation that would bar 
bilingual education programs for hispanics 
it is an aggressive and ambitious agenda says ralph neas 
executive director of the leadership conference but we are 
confident that the 101st congress will pass it we hope that the 
bush administration will play a constructive role 
as usual civil rights advocates are watching carefully to see if 
president bush will name federal judges inclined toward moderate 
positions or hardline conservatives who might challenge the legal 
changes of the past three decades 
judicial nominations are always a chief concern of civil rights 
groups they count the defeat of outspoken conservative robert bork 
for the supreme court as one of their most important victories of 
the reagan era 
but the showdown over bork represented only one in a series of 
capitol hill victories for civil rights forces over the last eight 
years 
the congress prevented the right wing from passing any major 
items on its legislative agenda and furthermore the congress 
during the reagan years passed many important civil rights 
initiatives says neas 
the conference points with pride to the success of last years 
bill to toughen fair housing enforcement recent victories on south 
africa sanctions legislation and the martin luther king holiday 
plus the congressional override of president reagans veto of the 
civil rights restoration act 
that legislation came in response to the supreme courts grove 
city decision in which the justices held that the government could 
not deny federal aid to one program merely because of discrimination 
in an unrelated program operated by the same institution 
in fact congress has passed so many measures urged by civil 
rights advocates that they now say some of the most pressing needs 
lie outside the legislative arena that is especially so with the 
departure of edwin meese iii as attorney general and william 
bradford reynolds the longtime head of the civil rights division in 
the reagan justice department 
a recent report from the citizens commission on civil rights a 
17member panel of former federal officials was sharply critical of 
the departments enforcement record in the reagan era 
it said for example that the reagan justice department filed 
about 10 housing bias cases annually half the number under the 
nixon and carter administrations 
i think the question of enforcement of civil rights laws will 
be stronger because i think that with reagan gone there will be no 
great voice of weakening says benjamin hooks executive director 
of the national association for the advancement of colored people 
and chairman of the leadership conference 
there may be some reluctance to move forward with civil rights 
legislation until president bush indicates what he might accept 
i think thats just a sensible thing to do says rep don 
edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary committees civil 
rights and civil liberties subcommittee 
meanwhile he envisions hearings in the year ahead to determine 
just how well the existing civil rights laws are being enforced 
additional sessions of his panel will take up the longfestering 
question of whether college entrance examinations are skewed toward 
whites and thus place minority students at an unfair disadvantage 
the equal rights amendment to the us constitution which would 
ban discrimination on the basis of gender remains a cause dear to 
womens groups and many civil rights advocates edwards says 
however that the measure will not be brought to the floor unless 
there is enough support to pass it

president bush defended the ethical conduct of 
highranking officials in his administration monday but said he 
might have to tighten standards and make our people bend over 
backwards so they avoid even the appearance of conflict of 
interest 
bushs statement came as c boyden gray his longtime counsel and 
chief ethics adviser reversed an earlier decision and resigned as 
chairman of a multimilliondollar communications company 
last week dr louis sullivan the presidents nominee as 
secretary of health and human services asked if he could take a 
paid sabbatical leave from the morehouse college school of medicine 
while serving in the cabinet sullivan said later he would forfeit 
his accumulated sabbatical pay estimated at 300000 
bush said both officials had acted properly and gone beyond what 
was actually required 
the president also defended former sen john tower of texas his 
nominee to be secretary of defense against new allegations of 
womanizing and drinking as well as other matters asked if would 
still endorse tower bush said yes i can and i will right now 
he said some of the allegations about tower have been examined by 
the fbi and found to be groundless however bush said if 
somebody comes up with facts i hope im not narrowminded enough 
that i wouldnt take another look 
bush said all of grays actions had been reviewed and approved by 
the office of government ethics as he served for eight years as 
bushs counsel during his vice presidency 
however bush said we are in a new era on these matters 
matters that might have been approved and looked at one way may 
have a different perception today so i think it might be 
different now i have to approach it differently as president 
bush said that when it comes to the appearance of conflict of 
interest id like our people to bend over backwards as far as 
we possibly can 
on the other hand bush said he didnt want to go overboard 
i dont want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible 
way that good people just throw up their hands and say look who 
needs that kind f grief who needs it why should i have to give up 
all my whatever it is a health plan from xyz company 
and yet he added were in a different time now were in 
a time when weve got to set these standards as high as possible 
spurred by publicity about his finances gray announced he was 
stepping down as chairman of the familyowned summit communications 
group inc and putting his personal assets estimated at 10 
million into a blind trust 
the office of government ethics is investigating whether gray 
should have reported 89000 in income from the company in 1985 and 
1986 the new york times reported in tuesdays editions 
a reporter for the newspaper had raised the issue monday and the 
office said later in the day that it was investigating the times 
said gray did not return a telephone call from the reporter seeking 
comment on why the money was not reported the times said 
gray deferred receiving the income his financial adviser john 
sheets told the times but deferred income had to be reported in the 
year it is earned said donald campbell deputy director of the 
ethics office according to the newspaper 
earlier gray had said he would remain as head of the firm but 
would refuse a salary complying with rules announced by bush last 
july during the presidential campaign gray changed his mind and 
decided to resign after consulting with the leaders of bushs new 
ethics commission and seeing his financial background become 
frontpage news 
he has done nothing wrong said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater theres been no conflict of interest he has not 
profited or benefited in any way from his government service but the 
issue has been raised now in the press and so he simply wanted to 
take care of it 
gray is the latest bush appointee to find himself in the 
spotlight after questions about his ethical or personal conduct 
allegations about drinking and womanizing by tower resulted in a 
delay on a confirmation vote by the senate armed services committee 
sullivan sought a ruling on whether he could accept 300000 in 
sabbatical pay earned as head of the morehouse school of medicine 
while taking a leave to serve in the cabinet saying he wanted to 
avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest sullivan said 
he would forfeit the sabbatical pay 
rejecting the notion the bush administration was having problems 
with ethics fitzwater said its the presidents spotlight of 
focus on this matter thats caused everyone to be so ultrasensitive 
about every little thing and so be it 
talking about gray and sullivan fitzwater said there was no 
real problem in either case but to avoid the appearance of conflict 
and to get on with the business they said fine do it 
he said grays decision was prompted in part by stories in the 
new york times and washington post which noted that the reagan white 
house had a policy banning employees from serving in board 
chairmanships and from earning outside income rather than try to 
let that fester you simply deal with it and go on fitzwater said 
although gray worked in the reagan administration he was not 
bound by those rules because he was employed by thenvice president 
bush whose policy was more lenient 
over the past eight years gray was paid hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for serving as chairman of the company that owns more at 
least a dozen radio stations and has about 130000 cable television 
subscribers in the south

a year ago the hopes of families of us 
servicemen shot down over cambodia during the vietnam war were 
buoyed by phnom penhs declaration that it was prepared to hand over 
the remains of 83 airmen to american officials 
but a diplomatic stalemate which some congressmen blame largely 
on state department inaction has prevented the return of the bodies 
and dimmed hopes for a return any time soon 
theyve made these gestures in the last year to turn remains 
over and so far the good faith hasnt been followed up on said 
rep john g rowland rconn theres the remains of 80 american 
soldiers over there and were tripping over bureaucracy 
during a january 1988 trip to southeast asia reps robert c 
smith rnh frank mccloskey dind and rowland were told by tep 
henn cambodias ambassador to vietnam that the cambodian 
government had the bodies of the american servicemen and would 
return them to us officials the condition the administration 
would have to make the request directly 
the lawmakers lobbied the state department and enlisted the help 
of senior legislators including the late rep bill nichols dala 
chairman of the house armed services investigations subcommittee 
but the administration agreed only to send a message through a 
third party the international red cross the united states does not 
recognize the cambodian regime of premier hun sen installed by 
vietnam after pol pot and his brutal khmer rouge regime were driven 
from power by vietnamese forces in late 1978 
we do not have diplomatic relations with phnom penh and we 
dont recognize it so any diplomatic approach would be 
inappropriate said alex almasov an east asian specialist at the 
state department 
the congressional critics point to diplomatic contact with 
vietnam over soldiers missinginaction there 
we dont recognize vietnam but were constantly interacting 
with them rowland said half the congress has been over there 
as well as special us emissaries 
weve picked up remains from libya and theyre not exactly our 
friends either he said we allowed them to get some political 
mileage 
while cambodia is essentially a satellite of vietnam diplomatic 
contact with phnom penh is a more delicate matter than dealing with 
hanoi which is largely accepted despite the lack of diplomatic ties 
in cambodia three rebel groups including the khmer rouge headed 
by pol pot and two others supported by us aid have been fighting 
to overthrow the vietnaminstalled government with vietnams pledge 
to withdraw its troops from cambodia hun sen is desperately seeking 
legitimacy for his government earlier this year he visited bangkok 
for the first time for negotiations with thai leaders to seek a 
resolution to the 10year conflict 
state department officials fear that the phnom penh government 
would simply use us contact over the mia issue as a political tool 
obviously what the phnom penh regime wants from us is some sort 
of diplomatic approach that would confer some sort of legitimacy on 
them almasov said since we feel the mia issue is a 
humanitarian one and since we have made it clear that we are 
prepared at any time to receive the remains they say they have we 
feel they should respond positively 
the gop congressmen say they are well aware of hun sens 
political motivations but they believe that direct contact over the 
remains alone would not seriously affect american foreign policy in 
southeast asia 
i have no desire to build him up and give him credibility 
but my god we have to be willing to at least talk to the people 
smith said 
he added that state department officials think it will shake 
our credibility in the region and insult indonesia and thailand i 
dont 
the congressmen believe phnom penh is genuinely willing to turn 
over the remains 
they have clearly seen the positive exposure vietnam has gotten 
by turning remains over i think they would like to duplicate 
that rowland said 
hun sen recently reiterated his willingness to discuss the mia 
issue with us officials but rowland predicted that cambodian 
leaders would hold out for direct us contact so they can get 
more bang for their effort

president bush will meet in tokyo later this 
month with king hussein of jordan and egyptian president hosni 
mubarak and then at the white house in the spring with them and 
israel prime minister yitzhak shamir according to state department 
officials 
the tokyo talks will be held when bush and the two arab leaders 
attend the funeral of emperor hirohito of japan details of the 
separate visits to washington by hussein mubarak and shamir will be 
worked out over the next few weeks us officials speaking on 
condition of anonymity said sunday 
the main topics are the future of restive palestinians on the 
israeliheld west bank and in gaza and the role the united states 
will try to play in settling the 40yearold arabisraeli conflict 
hirohitos funeral which will draw scores of world leaders to 
tokyo is accelerating bushs introduction to murky middle east 
diplomacy us policy is now under review by the new 
administration but secretary of state james baker iii said at his 
confirmation hearing last month that he is opposed to the 
establishment of an independent palestinian state 
hussein mubarak and shamir all notified the new administration 
separately that they would like to visit washington in the spring 
which could drive bush to an early decision on how to approach the 
palestinian problem and israels troubles with its arab neighbors 
after a slow start the reagan administration tried to steer 
israel and lebanon toward a peace settlement but that was undercut 
by syria the administration then tried to set up arabisraeli 
negotiations but despite four trips to the region by former 
secretary of state george shultz the effort failed shamir and 
hussein both rejected us proposals for peace talks while yasser 
arafat head of the palestine liberation organization kept 
palestinians from meeting with shultz 
in one of its final acts the reagan administration broke a 
13year freeze and opened talks with the plo but there are no 
indications this has improved prospects for a settlement or an 
easing of violence in the israeliheld territories 
hussein mubarak and shamir would make separate visits to 
washington the state department officials said they all asked to be 
received in the spring and timetables were being worked out 
administration officials on jan 28 opened informal talks with 
congress on possible arms sales to egypt saudi arabia and israel 
there were no items on the list for jordan which congress since 
1985 has excluded until the kingdom shows willingness to negotiate 
with israel to whom it lost the west bank in the 1967 mideast war 
jordanian prime minister zaid rifai was asked in an interview 
published sunday in the kuwaiti newspaper alwatan whether he 
thought the united states would offer a new middle east peace 
initiative 
were fed up with initiatives rifai said the basis for a 
settlement and the solutions are there and agreed upon 
internationally with the exception of the israeli stance and 
regrettably they israel are supported by the american stance

john white was chairman of the democratic party 
when he first got to know ron brown and paul kirk they were 
around the office all the time mostly with a press release 
demanding my resignation 
white a sandyhaired texan was jimmy carters handpicked choice 
to head the party 
brown and kirk were aides to sen edward m kennedy who was 
opposing the incumbent presidents bid for renomination 
this was down and dirty noholdsbarred politics ill whip 
his ass the president of the united states had said of the 
massachusetts senator who bore one of the most famous names in 
american politics 
but white was an old pro and brown and kirk were budding young 
pros 
hell they were so nice about it i just got so i would invite 
them in for a cup of coffee recalled white we just got to 
where we liked each other i knew what they were doing and they knew 
what i was doing 
six years later kirk became democratic party chairman and on 
friday the 47yearold brown will succeed him in that post that 
transition will take place when the democratic national committee 
meets at a washington hotel a few miles from the white house a 
building where only one democrat has resided during the past 20 
years 
when brown began his quest for the chairmanship his opponents 
portrayed him as jesses man a reference to his role in jesse 
jacksons presidential campaign 
and if not jesses man then teddys man a reference to his 
earlier involvement with kennedy 
ultra liberal was the assessment of the alabama party 
chairman the wrong symbol said many party officials at a time 
when the electorate seemed more comfortable with conservative views 
yet none of that criticism stuck and one by one browns four 
opponents in the chairmanship race dropped out and endorsed him 
in part he succeeded because the only label that has stuck 
firmly on brown is washington insider 
hes nobodys man but his own said kennedy ron could say 
no to me or to jesse jackson or to anyone else if he believed that 
whatever was requested wasnt in the interests of the party 
from his childhood brown has bridged two very different worlds 
he grew up in harlem but his parents sent him to predominantly 
white private schools on the upper east side of manhattan 
he attended middlebury college in vermont where he was one of 
only a handful of black students when he joined sigma phi epsilon 
fraternity the house was stripped of its national membership for 
violating the whitesonly charter 
at st johns university law school one of his professors was 
mario cuomo 
brown ran the washington office of the urban league before 
joining kennedys staff and becoming a senior aide on his 
presidential campaign later he became general counsel of the 
senate judiciary committee which kennedy chaired 
bigtime bigmoney law beckoned and brown now is a partner in 
one of the capitals biggest most politically active firms 
that was the period he also became deputy chairman of the 
democratic national committee once again he was seen as teddys 
man at the dnc the party official who would look after the 
senators interests in advance of the 1984 presidential campaign 
chuck campion was at the dnc as walter mondales man campion 
recalled that instead of becoming rivals they became friends an 
outcome typical of browns career 
his law practice prospered with clients that included the 
japanese electronics industry and the government of haiti so did 
his establishment credentials he is a member of the middlebury 
board of trustees and chairman of the advisory committee for the 
kennedy school of government at harvard 
during a visit to middlebury last fall a student asked brown for 
advice on pursuing a political career 
his response offered an insight to his careful operating style 
keep a diary write down the names of people you meet and then 
keep track of them remember them when you meet them again 
connections are important 
a little ironic coming from a man whose connections were used 
against him in his most prominent effort to strike out on his own in 
politics 
when kennedy didnt run in 1984 brown stayed on the sidelines 
that was the campaign in which jackson emerged as a force in 
democratic party politics 
four years later jackson was rebuffed when he tried to get brown 
to head his 1988 presidential campaign 
as the campaign approached the end of the primary season the 
jackson forces began looking ahead to the democratic national 
convention that would take place in atlanta in july it was clear 
that michael dukakis would be the presidential nominee but jackson 
and his followers had a full agenda 
jim hightower the populist agriculture commissioner from texas 
was the choice of jackson aides to head their convention operation 
but then ann lewis a top adviser to jackson suggested brown 
ron knew the players and knew the territory jim didnt said 
white who also was advising jackson 
to the relief of most democrats brown agreed to take on the job 
there was a rather tense atmosphere going into the 
convention recalled paul brountas chairman of the dukakis 
campaign the reverend jackson had started a bus caravan in 
chicago which picked up speed and people on the way to the 
convention this was after several weeks where reverend jackson was 
hitting dukakis pretty hard building an expectation that jackson 
deserved more than he had received 
none of that created an environment which assured any kind of 
unity brountas said 
brown and brountas met privately on the saturday before the 
convention and the jackson aide showed up with a list of his 
concerns 
by the time their meeting ended brountas said i understood 
where he was coming from and i was able to respond to most of them 
and give an indication where i was coming from 
there would be more meetings including one that included dukakis 
and jackson the result was a convention that ended on a note of 
harmony 
during his visit to middlebury brown said the jackson candidacy 
showed that the issue of race has become less of a factor in 
american politics 
browns accession to the chairmanship of his party may confirm 
that assessment or may offer new evidence of how strong a factor 
race continues to be

drug czardesignate william j bennett took a 
close look at the heart of the problem with a twohour tour of 
detroit a visit that underlined the urgency of working fast to 
make things better 
we have a deadly serious issue on our hands he said sunday 
in a telephone interview from the detroit airport its 
compelling this was factfinding for me very preliminary to find 
out what people on the ground are facing 
they emphasized what i was looking at was the heart of the 
problem he said downtown detroit is as bad as it gets 
anywhere 
last year detroit recorded 629 homicides an 83 percent drop 
from the 686 homicides in 1987 according to city police statistics 
the city figures did not indicate how many of them were drugrelated 
an analysis of fbi crime statistics by the detroit free press 
showed washington was the only city last year with a higher ratio of 
murders per 100000 people 
the visit didnt result in any specific plans for how the war 
against drugs should be waged or how he should handle his new job 
said bennett who has been nominated by president bush to become 
director of national drug control policy 
ive got to work all parts of it he said what i saw today 
only underlined the urgency of working fast to make things better 
it must get better 
detroit police cmdr joel gilliam told him one index showing 
we are winning the battle will be when the price goes up and purity 
goes down but prices are down and purity is up bennett recalled 
whether drug trafficking was going on during the tour was a 
matter of opinion bennett said he didnt see any but the officers 
accompanying him gilliam who is chief of staff to detroit police 
chief william hart and sgt bruce ford said they did 
my eyes arent sufficiently expert discerning yet to spot 
the drug deals he said it was also sunday afternoon not 
saturday night 
bennett deferred questions on what the drug budget should be 
saying that six months after he is confirmed by the senate 
hearings begin march 1 he will have completed a national drug 
strategy and that will have budget implications 
he said he plans additional factfinding tours but he refused to 
disclose which cities he might visit 
bennett went to detroit because of a speaking engagement at 
cranbrook school a private school in the wealthy suburb of 
bloomfield hills mich the talk had been scheduled before bush 
nominated him to the drug czar post 
i told them when i got to the podium that ive just been in 
downtown detroit and now im in one of the loveliest places in 
america i feel like im getting the bends

its a mail carriers nightmare a magazine 
lovers delight someone is ordering magazine subscriptions by the 
dozens for five city officials in this increasingly literate 
northern ohio town 
its pretty entertaining said city service director charles 
ramer who has received 70 subscriptions from the anonymous donor 
there is always something to read there are a lot of 
magazines that i never knew existed 
although some of the magazines have been obscure most are fairly 
wellknown they include time popular photography working woman 
people sassy mens health life consumer reports and ladies 
home journal 
if the magazines had been weird magazines i would have been 
more concerned but they werent said mayor william lamb whos 
received about a dozen subscriptions 
the officials have asked the magazines publishers to cancel the 
subscriptions and in most cases the companies have complied 
some magazines have arrived with cards telling the new and 
surprised reader that the subscription is a gift for example city 
council president wilda bell got a card saying lamb had given her a 
subscription 
its a nuisance said lamb who later was billed for the 
subscription people keep coming up to me and thanking me for 
sending them a magazine and i have to tell them that i didnt send 
it i like wilda but not 109 worth

book because guinness doesnt have a category for gingerbread men 
its disappointing to us said kathy lockwitch assistant 
manager at kinsleys bakery if we would have known we would have 
attempted something else or we wouldnt have bothered 
lockwitch said bakery manager jerry laiso called guinness before 
he and lockwitch made the giant cookie she says he was told that 
guinness would consider their claim after they had made their 
gingerbread man 
but cyd smith assistant editor at guinness said she told a 
kinsley employee that there was no category for a gingerbread man 
and little chance that guinness would add the category 
people sometimes dont want to hear what youre saying she 
said they dont want to hear no because theyre determined to 
do their thing 
it took 300 pounds of gingerbread mix 280 pounds of icing 600 
egg whites and nearly 100 hours to create the giant cookie with 
all the attention and publicity we got we thought we were in 
lockwitch said 
but late last month kinsleys received a letter from guiness 
explaining the books position adding insult to injury the letter 
added that kinsleys had no claim on the world record anyway because 
a chef in buffalo ny created a 24foot gingerbread man in 1987

residents are expressing relief 
because of the arrests of five people who are accused of holding up 
amish farmers at gunpoint as they milked cows drove buggies or made 
harnesses 
two of these men have confessed and weve recovered some of 
the billfolds taken in the holdups said lawrence county sheriff 
tom pyrdum i feel weve got all the people involved 
for many folks life here centers on a job at the murrayohio 
bicycle plant the communitys largest employer or raising cattle 
and growing soybeans and corn 
they picnic at the david crockett state park named for the alamo 
hero whose presence permeates this town of 12000 in the tennessee 
hills south of nashville a statue honoring crockett who once 
operated a gristmill here stands in the heart of downtown and 
billboards extol the david crockett motel and miniwarehouses 
the town typically is so peaceful that it attracted a group of 
amish who left pennsylvania in the winter of 1944 
but that serenity was shattered last month when armed robbers 
began sticking up the amish as they milked cows in barns or drove 
their buggies 
the holdups began jan 22 when two amish farmers were robbed of 
85 by three armed men in masks and camouflage outfits who burst 
into a barn in nearby ethridge 
five days later three amish men were robbed of about 140 in two 
separate holdups when a man leaped into their buggies brandished a 
gun and demanded cash 
on jan 30 two men one of them carrying a sawedoff shotgun 
took 300 from an amish harnessmaker as he worked in his shop on a 
farm north of ethridge 
residents were outraged by the robberies 
the people who live here know the amish and do business with 
them said district attorney general mike bottoms they dont 
ever cause anybody any trouble they mind their own business and 
raise their families 
the amish a conservative offshoot of the mennonite church are 
noted for a lifestyle thats dogmatic in its simplicity 
the women wear long dresses and bonnets the men black round 
hats with dark blue jackets and pants they disdain buttons as a 
sign of vanity 
among themselves they still speak german accounting for a 
persistent accent in their english they refuse to own telephones or 
automobiles although they will ride buses or occasionally in a car 
and they believe in nonviolence which authorities said has made 
them easy prey for bandits 
people dont like to see the amish picked on said bob moore 
who works for the lawrence county ambulance service at the same 
time it makes people angry that they dont do anything to fight 
back 
the recent holdups as well as the unsolved jan 29 robbery and 
stabbing death of an elderly nonamish man in ethridge prompted 
pyrdums investigators to work around the clock 
the break came pyrdum said when they were able to link a 
partial license plate number to the description of a pickup truck 
used in the harness shop robbery 
on thursday deputies arrested michael mcconnell 24 and his 
nephews rodney jd smith 18 and james e smith jr 22 all from 
lawrenceburg and charged them with various counts of armed robbery 
each was being held on 250000 bond 
two lawrenceburg juveniles ages 16 and 17 also were arrested 
bottoms said the state has filed a motion to have them tried as 
adults 
although the amish have been reluctant in the past to file 
charges neither pyrdum nor bottoms said they expect any problem 
bringing the case to trial 
we dont have a lot of cases with the amish but when we do 
theyll come and testify truthfully said bottoms i dont have 
any doubt that theyll continue to cooperate with us 
the arrests brought a welcome sense of relief to the amish 
although many were reticent 
im glad they were caught it was correct to assist the 
sheriffs department in order to stop the robbing said a 
67yearold amish farmer who spoke on the condition that his name 
not be used

pravda reported that the last soviet 
soldier had left the capital but several hundred red army troops 
guarded kabuls airport on monday as military transports flew in 
grain and other supplies 
the communist party daily also reported that soviet troops would 
move monday out of the main military complex at shindand in western 
afghanistan the paper said soviet defensive checkpoints along the 
withdrawal route from the capital had been removed as far as 50 
miles north of kabul 
yesterday the last soviet soldier left kabul pravda said in 
mondays report 
however several hundred soviet soldiers were seen at the airport 
today soviet officials said about 1000 soviet soldiers were still 
at the airport on the outskirts of the city 
they said the last convoy left the capital on saturday 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
troops at the airport are assisting the supply airlift into the city 
and are not expected to pull out until feb 12 or feb 14 
the officials said troops were still moving up the salang 
highway the only land route north from kabul to the soviet border 
they said the troop movement was slow and there had been avalanches 
and some casualties but no rebel attacks 
on sunday radio moscow quoted the commander of soviet forces in 
afghanistan gen boris gromov as saying the withdrawal was 
proceeding according to schedule 
he said that the column of soviet troops did not come under 
fire there were snow slides during the withdrawal though and 
three men were killed and one was injured by them the radio 
reported 
in kabul on sunday president najib told about 10000 members of 
the peoples democratic party of afghanistan that his marxist 
government will survive the rebel onslaught despite the soviet 
pullout after more than nine years of occupation 
god is with us the people are with us we will win the war 
najib told about 10000 members of the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan who gathered in freezing temperatures near the 
presidential palace 
soviet and afghan officials said during the weekend there were 
about 1000 soviet soldiers still in afghanistan and that they could 
be gone as early as wednesday 
in neighboring pakistan soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze extended talks on the civil war guerrilla sources said 
he would meet monday with the moslem insurgents fighting the 
sovietbacked afghan government 
leaders of the iran and pakistanbased resistance signed a 
cooperation pact sunday in the iranian capital irans foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati said the agreement could boost the 
guerrillas chances of taking over in afghanistan and creating an 
islamic republic once the soviets are gone 
najibs rally broadcast on national television was staged 
largely for the dozens of foreign journalists in afghanistan for the 
soviet withdrawal 
the russian armies are leaving the country and we will defend 
ourselves said the 43yearold najib dressed in combat fatigues 
we have to be strong we have to unite 
as he spoke more than a dozen giant soviet transport planes 
streaked off in different directions spewing flares designed to 
deflect heatseeking missiles fired by the guerrillas or mujahedeen 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
replace one marxist regime with another and stayed to help fight the 
us and pakistanibacked insurgents 
under a unmediated agreement moscow agreed last year to 
withdraw all its troops out by feb 15 
the soviets began their pullout in may and resumed it january 
when convoys of tanks trucks and armored personnel carriers started 
heading up the salang highway toward the soviet border 260 miles 
away 
the pravda report said that in the western sector two columns 
had left shindand heading towards kushka on the soviet border

coalition in pakistan 
they finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future 
government for afghanistan he told the associated press

after decades of studying wildlife in an 
unspoiled area of antarctica scientists have begun a new unwelcome 
line of research the effects of an oil spill 
this disaster is the experiment nobody wanted said national 
science foundation spokesman jack talmadge 
by tuesday american cleanup crews are expected to reach the area 
affected by the sinking of an oilladen supply ship which ran 
aground jan 28 off the antarctic peninsula 
scientists have already seen oilcovered and apparently lethargic 
seals three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting 
birds said ted delaca chief scientist of the foundations division 
of polar programs 
thirtyeight of 40 penguins checked friday bore traces of oil 
thousands of dead and dying krill shrimplike crustaceans that are a 
key food for bigger animals have shown up on beaches delaca told 
reporters by telephone from palmer station a research outpost near 
the spill 
all the principle penguin rookeries here are now surrounded 
by fuel oil he said what its effect could be on the birds is 
anybodys guess 
adelie penguin chicks are expected to leave their nests for the 
first time in a few days swimming into contaminated waters other 
birds are being exposed to the oil as they land on water or dive 
into it to feed 
scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the 
oil disrupts their natural insulation or be poisoned if they 
swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oilcovered prey 
the spill struck an area that has the largest and most diverse 
plant and animal populations of the continent said polly penhale 
manager of the science foundations polar biology and medicine 
program 
apart from the large seal population about 30000 sea birds live 
there including adelie and chinstrap penguins cormorants kelp 
gulls and giant petrels she said 
scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20 
years but now the pristine nature of the area has been altered 
the paths of research that have been followed down there have 
been forever changed said talmadge i think if youre a 
scientist in the year 2035 youve got to remember there was an oil 
spill 
delaca said the highly sensitive environment has been 
compromised in a way that we cant even evaluate right now 
langdon quetin research biologist at the university of 
california in santa barbara said if the oil spill causes dramatic 
damage or longterm effects on plants and animals then we cant 
really depend on the area as a natural uncontaminated laboratory 
that really is unfortunate to say the least because it is one 
of the few areas in the antarctic we have good logistics to he 
said it will be the ruination of a good laboratory at least in 
the near future at least as a natural uncontaminated study area 
some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other 
organisms kept in tanks at palmer station which marine botanist 
mike neushul of the university of california at santa barbara calls 
probably the best marine biology laboratory in the antarctic 
the tanks draw water from the nearby harbor and if oil 
contaminates that supply the experiments might have to be stopped 
nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem penhale said 
neushul said one factor boding poorly for the areas wildlife is 
that the spill involved fuel oil which is much more toxic than 
crude oil because it can damage biological tissue 
neushul who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off 
the baja california coast some 30 years ago said the effects of 
that spill lasted 17 years 
in addition recovery in antarctica may be prolonged because 
bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down said 
paul dayton professor of marine ecology at the scripps institute of 
oceanography in la jolla calif

editors note barry renfrew the ap bureau chief in islamabad 
pakistan from 1985 to 1987 has just made his fourth trip into 
afghanistan with moslem guerrillas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the road to kabul is littered 
with burnedout afghan army tanks trucks and security posts 
abandoned by retreating communist forces 
dotted along the highway leading from the pakistani border to the 
afghan capital about 120 miles to the west are signs of the collapse 
of the afghan army in the area as moslem insurgents move in 
guerrilla commanders say afghan government forces began to 
disintegrate after soviet troops pulled out of the area late last 
year under a total withdrawal plan now in its final days 
the communists are all gone they are running for their 
lives said one guerrilla commander 
tanks and armored personnel carriers destroyed by guerrilla 
rockets stood abandoned in the center of the highway or lie in 
roadside ditches trucks and radio command vehicles stood where 
their crews abandoned them 
senior guerrilla commanders told a visiting journalist over the 
weekend that afghan army forces in the area are surrounded in the 
major city of jalalabad and a few outlying towns they claim 
government troops are demoralized that just a handful of diehard 
communists want to fight 
the afghan army is composed mainly of illtrained conscripts who 
are unwilling to fight for the sovietbacked kabul government 
western intelligence estimates put its strength nationwide at 30000 
troops 
afghan army units around jalalabad have put up little resistance 
as the red army withdraws after nine years of propping up the kabul 
regime 
commander abdul zaher said the guerrillas expect jalalabad to 
surrender soon when its supplies run out but would attack if the 
garrison tried to hold out the guerrillas he said wanted to avoid 
civilian casualties 
the only sign of fighting were a few salvos from government 
artillery in the distance around jalalabad which is about 90 miles 
east of kabul guerrilla commanders said 12000 insurgents were 
surrounding jalalabad but there was little fighting 
when the communist government is destroyed the fighting will 
end said khial nur a commander of the guerrillas most of whom 
are based in pakistan the insurgents are aided chiefly by pakistan 
and the united states 
an afghan army prisoner dressed in a ragged green uniform 
appeared dazed and shocked as guerrillas helped him walk to their 
base he does not want to fight we will look after him said 
one guerrilla 
some of the abandoned afghan army bases and security posts along 
the kabul highway bore signs of heavy fighting walls had been 
shatteered by mortar and rocket fire and were pocked with 
machinegun bullets 
other installations were undamaged and appeared to have been 
abandoned without a fight 
at landhi khyber guerrillas relaxed in a sprawling afghan army 
base green islamic flags with crossed swords fluttered from the top 
of the barracks and guerrillas prayed in the courtyard 
the burnedout wrecks of about 20 afghan army trucks littered 
what was once the motor pool a few bits of green and khaki army 
clothing lay on the ground flung away by fleeing soldiers 
at gerde ghous about 20 miles east of jalalabad guerrillas 
showed off a captured barracks they said once housed 1200 
government militia troops buildings were pocked with bullet holes 
two shattered tanks stood on the nearby highway their guns pointing 
blindly into the air 
guerrillas had crawled their names and islamic slogans on 
captured army posts long live islamic holy war said a slogan 
at ghazi abad 
insurgents wearing traditional baggy afghan trousers long shirts 
and turbans perched on gutted tanks yelling greetings to bands of 
compatriots who roared up the highway in trucks and buses islamic 
flags and posters were plastered on the wrecked army vehicles 
dushman dushman beaming guerrillas shouted as they pointed 
to the tanks and other wrecked vehicles using the pushtu word for 
enemy 
all of the wrecked and abandoned army vehicles were sovietmade 
operating instructions in russian on metal plates were still bolted 
inside the turrets of burned out t54 and t55 tanks 
captured army trucks still in working condition were being used 
by the guerrillas to ferry men and supplies towards jalalabad 
islamic banners fluttered from the trucks and pictures of guerrilla 
leaders were plastered on windshields 
bands of guerrilla fighters with bandoliers of bullets across 
their chests and machine guns and rifles hanging from their 
shoulders stood guard in every village and hamlet along the highway 
we are happy soon we will have islamic government and 
afghanistan will be free said one of the guerrillas

canadians looking for assurance that their country 
wont be ignored by washington now that a free trade agreement 
between the two countries is in place should be cheered by president 
bushs visit to ottawa this week 
bush continues a pattern set by ronald reagan in making his first 
presidential trip abroad to canada 
there have been hints that bushs halfday meeting friday with 
prime minister brian mulroney will be just the first of several 1989 
sessions an increase from the recent pattern of annual meetings 
canadians often complain that americans ignore or take for 
granted their northern neighbor and fail to recognize that their 
trade relationship is the largest of any two countries in the world 
after a heated election campaign last fall that attracted an 
unusual amount of international attention mulroneys progressive 
conservative party won a second consecutive majority government 
that cleared the way for the free trade agreement with the united 
states that he and reagan signed in january 1988 to take effect on 
new years day as scheduled 
the pact phases out all remaining tariffs between the two 
countries over a 10year period sets up panels to resolve disputes 
and eases barriers to investment and trade in energy and services 
opponents had argued that canada risked being overpowered by the 
vastly greater population and economic power of the united states 
labor groups in canada are now gearing up to bring attention to 
the closings of any plants that can be blamed on the trade pact 
although the pacts supporters forecast a net increase of 250000 
jobs in canada over 10 years they concede some plant closings will 
take place as business and industry restructure for the larger north 
american market 
the summit friday is expected to be largely a formal affair that 
will set the stage for future working sessions the top issue for 
discussion is certain to be acid rain 
william k reilly bushs choice for head of the environmental 
protection agency attracted widespread attention in canada with his 
comments about acid rain at his nomination hearing in washington 
in a major shift from reagans policy reilly said legislation to 
curb acid rain is first out of the box for the bush 
administration the reagan administration did not propose 
legislation to strengthen the clean air act 
canada has been pressing for an agreement on a timetable to 
reduce to specified levels coalfired power plant emissions that 
damage forests and lakes 
mulroney who shared with reagan an irish heritage and 
conservative outlook has called bush a great friend of canada 
the prime minister said during the fall campaign that he expected 
his good relationship with washington to produce an agreement on 
acid rain 
michael hawes a political scientist at queens university in 
kingston ontario said the bush visit wont necessarily be praised 
here just because it is his first 
i dont think were going to think of this as anything but 
ordinary that he should do this hawes who specializes in 
canadianus relations said in a telephone interview 
if bush had chosen another destination for his first trip 
however it would have touched off a chorus of complaints hawes 
said

the agriculture department is about to announce 
a joint venture with the plymouth division of chrysler motors to 
help put its recreational scenic byway program into overdrive 
billed as a pioneering partnership between plymouth and the 
departments forest service the details are expected to be 
announced thursday at a joint news conference followed by a 
reception at usdas interior patio 
the scenic byway program began last year with the designation of 
a 26mile stretch of us highway 64 in southeastern tennessee a 
number of others have since been designated and officials say 
various groups have worked with usda to place interpretive signs 
develop brochures and provide facilities to help make driving 
through national forest more enjoyable 
but the addition of chryslers plymouth division is being counted 
on by usda officials to pump new life into the scenic byways program 
and hopefully become a showcase of private sector participation 
a private nonprofit forest education foundation in santa ana 
calif is the prime mover in plymouths involvement says forest 
service spokeswoman marty longan the group is also the skier 
education foundation 
longan said that one of the main goals of plymouth involvement is 
to increase public awareness of scenic byways through national 
promotions 
there has been talk that the campaign might include plymouth 
dealer promotions and prizes although longan said she wasnt 
certain this had been settled national forest offices might be 
involved too she said 
weve done lots of partnerships or cooperative agreements 
with nonprofit organizations she said thats what most of our 
experience has been in the past this is probably the first real big 
one that weve had with a private corporation 
there has been grumbling among some usda professionals who think 
the highvisibility and direct role of chrysler motors is not 
appropriate although commercial products and private companies have 
had a long association with department promotional efforts 
most of the time in the past the identities of companies and 
brand names have been downplayed as in large displays of groceries 
to represent family food expenditures generic promotion of pizza 
ice cream and other foods are other examples 
but usda lawyers are not fearful that the forest service is doing 
anything wrong in its scenic byways arrangement with chrysler 
j michael kelly associate general counsel said he had not been 
asked for an opinion on the agencys program with the automaker nor 
had he had an opportunity to study the plan 
but very often he said private sector efforts are channeled 
through a foundation usually one that is nonprofit so that a 
government agency can say truthfully that it doesnt do business 
directly with the foundation thus there is no conflict of interest 
in this case i have no idea what business usda if any might 
do with the plymouth division of chrysler motors kelly said in a 
telephone interview no doubt in usdas many fleets of 
automobiles there are probably some chyrsler cars and trucks 
but chrysler is contributing through a foundation and that 
generally passes ethical muster and doesnt raise any significant 
questions he said

a report to the soil conservation service says 
the agencys field personnel should be rewarded for providing 
exceptional service to small farmers who have limited resources 
the report was the result of a study by the university of 
maryland eastern shore on the impact of the 1985 farm law on 
limitedresource farmers the study was based on interviews with 
1390 farmers who farm 50 acres or less in alabama florida 
maryland north carolina and texas 
farmers with household incomes of less than 25000 a year were 
considered limitedresource farmers 
the 1985 law requires farmers to have a conservation plan 
completed by dec 31 1989 if they are to continue farming highly 
erodible cropland and still receive usda benefits including price 
supports and emergency aid 
according to the study only 25 percent of those surveyed had 
conservation plans and 23 percent had never heard of a conservation 
plan 
only 5 percent of the limitedresource farmers many of whom 
farm marginal land felt they have a severe erosion problem the 
agency said 
the reports findings and recommendations were sent to the scs at 
the agriculture department 
to raise the consciousness of scs personnel for the special 
concerns of these farmers the agency should use its award and 
evaluation system to recognize and award those working with 
limitedresource farmers in an exceptional manner the report said

a nation at risk the landmark federal report 
that condemned mediocrity in americas schools nearly six years ago 
shocked the nation into a flurry of reform 
but three new reports describing the sad state of us students 
abilities in mathematics might be even more cause for alarm 
on the surface the reports released last week revealed little we 
havent heard before 
repeatedly during the last decade international comparisons have 
shown us students lagging behind other youngsters in math 
a world of differences a report by the educational testing 
service assessing 24000 13yearolds in six countries found south 
koreans doing best among students from ireland england canada and 
spain 
us pupils scored dead last 
a report by the national research council everybody counts a 
report to the nation on the future of mathematics education 
concluded that the nation desperately needs to agree on how math 
should be taught but it noted that compared with japan or korea 
math reform has consistently gotten nowhere in the united states 
largely because our decentralized national school structure makes 
consensus building so difficult 
the topdown systems have beaten us hands down the report 
concluded 
a survey conducted by the university of michigan compared math 
achievement levels of first and fifthgraders in the chicago area 
and beijing china it found american youngsters performing 
significantly worse than their chinese counterparts 
interestingly that survey also found that the american parents 
would be satisfied if their children scored a 70 on a math test the 
chinese parents had higher aspirations their children would need to 
score in the 90s to please them 
but the larger significance of these latest reports lays in two 
other findings students scoring highest did the most homework and 
watched the least television koreans ranked first in math homework 
with 45 percent doing at least one to two hours a week us 
students ranked last with 28 percent doing that amount 
if homework is indeed so central to better math scores and if 
mathematical knowhow is really as crucial as everyone insists it is 
to americas economic competitiveness america may be in more 
trouble than realized 
its common sense that students who do the most homework usually 
have the strongest belief that hard work pays off but some us 
educators wonder whether these math scores demonstrate that american 
youngsters have grown soft on hard work 
i think its a cultural phenomenon in this country said 
scott thomson executive director of the national association of 
secondary school principals we dont recognize the importance of 
studying math or studying tough subjects 
the countries that are most successful like japan or korea 
say right up front that it takes hard work and long hours and 
grinding it out we as a nation tend to be impatient with 
everything including studying 
put bluntly with math as with no other subject theres simply 
no faking it the answers right or wrong you either took the time 
at home to memorize and drill and practice or you didnt 
but equally important homework and a wholesome home environment 
are inseparable merely requiring teachers to assign more is like 
pushing on a string homework wont get done by the student who is 
hungry or unhealthy or chronically unhappy in singlefamily home 
environments where parents are uninvolved in their youngsters 
education 
chronically weak math scores then indicate problems not just 
with our schools but our society problems that wont be solved 
merely by tinkering with curricula or teaching methods though such 
changes may well be in order 
it means that there is probably no quick fix for low math scores 
and schools cant solve the problem alone 
given its exactitude mathematics is one of the truest 
bellwethers of the nations progress in educating children for the 
21st century in that sense these reports contain plenty to worry 
about

as a broiling summer day dissolved into a 
sultry night at new yorks coxsackie state prison joseph puma 
waited to see if five prison guards held hostage by prisoners would 
make it out alive 
after 14 hours about midnight the inmates released their 
hostages 
this guy came out a friend of mine he was bloody beaten 
battered and he wore inmate clothing he just collapsed in my arms 
crying said puma head of the state prison guards union 
puma saw the pain in the faces of the guards and their families 
and came up with an idea the union through lloyds of london 
established a captivity coverage insurance plan with benefits 
to be paid to survivors of prison uprisings 
its believed to be the first time an insurance company has 
allowed such a policy said nels carlson a lloyds underwriter 
union members held hostage at least 12 hours would be paid a sum 
equal to half their annual salary in the case of death or injury 
the insurance benefit paid to the guard or his family would be twice 
the salary a new york prison guards average annual pay 27500 
its kind of like your life insurance where you hope it never 
gets paid out but it happens said hardy rauch director of 
standards and accreditation for the american correctional 
association in laurel md the concept is quite nice its an idea 
that could very easily be expanded to other states 
its appropriate the idea should come from new york a state 
still haunted by the 1971 riot at attica americas bloodiest prison 
uprising inmates took 39 hostages in a fourday standoff that ended 
in furious gunfire fortythree inmates and prison employees died 
no one died in augusts coxsackie uprising but it changed the 
lives of the five guards involved 
the guards were watching a group of 32 prisoners with 
disciplinary problems the baddest of the bad when they were 
overpowered 
the five guards were blindfolded and moved from cell to cell 
while their captors negotiated with authorities a knife and razor 
blades were held to their throats and one guard was told his finger 
would be cut off if he didnt relinquish his wedding ring all were 
beaten 
its probably the biggest fear of a security officer puma 
said youre reversing the roles and now these sick and deranged 
people are in charge of your every move 
citing pending court cases and the trauma the five former 
hostages wouldnt talk about their experiences none of them still 
works as a guard 
psychological reactions to being taken hostage can range from a 
slight depression that lasts a few days to becoming completely 
dysfunctional said dr robin inwald a new york city psychologist 
who has studied the reactions of former prison hostages 
its controversial as to when they should go back into the 
prisons she added going back is important to recover the 
feeling of being in control of your life 
some never go back of 17 guards who were held for 2 days at new 
york states sing sing prison in 1982 only one is still working in 
the prisons said chuck booth a spokesman for the guards union 
its not something they want to talk about jimmy mann union 
chief at attica said of the three guards still working there who 
were taken hostage in 1971 theyve accepted it 
none of the guards from coxsackie attica or sing sing are 
eligible to claim money from the unions policy which cost about 
100000 puma said 
the union leader has promised that dues wont be raised to pay 
for the new insurance but he said it might be on the bargaining 
table when the unions contract with the state expires 
puma called the insurance gofishing money he said it will 
enable former hostages to take time off or search for a new job with 
fewer worries about feeding their family 
these hostage situations do not happen every day thank god 
but when they do happen its the worst thing that can happen to a 
person he said lets do a little something extra for them

and the tokyo stock exchanges leading index rose to another record 
high 
the dollar closed at 12970 yen 043 yen higher than fridays 
close of 12927 yen it opened at 12975 yen and traded in a range 
between 12970 yen and 13001 yen 
the higher opening in tokyo following the dollars climb in new 
york was prompted by us employment figures announced on friday 
said a dealer with the bank of tokyo speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the us jobless rate in january rose to 54 percent from 
decembers 53 percent but an increase of 408000 in 
nonagricultural employees from december encouraged dollarbuying by 
market players who took the figure as indicating continuous growth 
in the us economy he added 
dollarbuying also was encouraged by a meeting in washington 
friday of the finance ministers of seven major industrial nations 
who accepted current exchange rates the dealer said 
japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news conference 
today that representatives of the seven also agreed to strengthen 
policy coordination the seven are the united states japan 
britain france west germany italy and canada 
the bank of tokyo dealer said the dollars recent upward trend is 
quite strong based on such factors as high interest rates in the 
united states high us interest rates make dollardenominated 
investments more attractive 
but the us currencys movement was expected to be limited as 
other financial markts in asia including those in hong kong and 
singapore were closed today for the chinese lunar new year holiday 
they will reopen thursday 
on the stock market the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 
14297 points or 045 percent closing at 3182875 the indexs

police temporarily closed communist chinas 
largest avantgarde art exhibit ever because organizers allowed 
performance art which culminated in the firing of two bbs into a 
sculpture an organizer said today 
fei dawei said the show would most likely reopen on friday after 
the end of the spring festival chinas fourday long lunar new year 
holiday 
he said he did not believe the order was a sign of a new 
crackdown on art 
they are just punishing us for the trouble we caused he 
said i think the political element here is very small 
fei said a woman wanted in connection with sundays shooting 
incident had been detained by police later that day 
the woman xiao lu an artist from hangzhou was initially 
believed to have shot her own work of art a phone booth located on 
the first floor of the china art gallery 
but fei said police determined that her boyfriend tang song 
actually fired two bbs into the work police detained tang at the 
show and found ms xiao later 
what we know now is that they walked into the gallery she 
handed him the gun and he shot her artwork he said it was a 
performance art piece together they were attempting to negate 
modern civilization 
modern art has not been popular with the chinese government 
because its abstract and chaotic forms did not serve the interests 
of the ruling communist party recently however the government has 
allowed exhibitions of once banned art forms such as nudes as long 
as the exhibitions can pay for themselves 
organizers of the avantgarde show have tried for three years to 
put it together it was approved last year only after they had 
raised all the money 
the shooting of the phone booth was the last of several 
performance art pieces done in the gallery in defiance of a ban on 
such art 
fei said museum officials banned the pieces because they said it 
might cause chaos in society 
one artist sold shrimp to protest the commercialization of 
art three others wrapped from head to toe in white cloth walked 
around the gallery 
another took off some of his clothes and began sitting on several 
eggs 
and one strolled around the gallery tossing handful of change and 
condoms on the floor 
museum officials ordered these artists to stop their performances 
but none were arrested police did confiscate the identity cards of 
the three who walked around the gallery covered in cloth 
fei said he understood why police were punishing the organizers 
as organizers we are responsible he said they are 
closing the show now because the masses are on vacation and they all 
want to see it we will lose a good portion of our spectators this 
way 
after the show was closed sunday hundreds of spectators and 
artists spilled into the courtyard in front of the china art gallery 
at one point two carloads of riot police wearing helmets and 
toting automatic weapons and teargas cannisters drove into the 
crowd they left immediately after their cars were surrounded by 
curious onlookers 
that must be performance art too said one artist 
the museum is closed mondays the show is scheduled to run to 
feb 19

scott novaks luck catching walleyes won 
him top prizes in a weekend icefishing contest but the outing 
turned tragic a few hours later for him and three fellow teenagers 
encamped on frozen harpt lake 
all four were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning sunday in 
the wooden shanty where they had tried to keep warm with propane 
heaters as temperatures dipped below zero during the weekend contest 
it was too airtight said sandy koller whose 16yearold 
daughter sarah was among the victims found in the newly built 
shack 
mishicot high school where all four teenagers were students 
planned to bring in extra counselors and hold a faculty meeting 
before school today to help other students cope with the tragedy 
said principal terry vanhimbergen 
were seeing some reaction from kids already he said 
novak 17 captured first second and thirdplace in the 
contest by catching the three largest fish said august stueck a 
contest organizer 
his thirdplace catch was registered with contest officials at 
1150 pm saturday less than seven hours before the bodies were 
found 
the teens were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes from two 
portable propane heaters and a propane hot plate left running in the 
shanty said detective leo jadowski of the manitowoc county 
sheriffs department 
the unpainted 7footby6foot wooden shanty was one of more 
than 50 such shelters on the frozen 70acre lake about 85 miles 
north of milwaukee temperatures near manitowoc ranged from 16 below 
and 5 below zero overnight 
the victims were identified as novak miss koller cory a 
throndson 16 and shawn shoulak 16 said rita schultz a sheriffs 
department dispatcher 
the cause of death for all four victims was lethal doses of 
carbon monoxide jadowski said its a small ice shanty unit and 
the carbon monoxide must have filled it 
some of the fumes in the shanty also may have come from the 
corner of a synthetic sleeping bag that brushed against a heater and 
melted officials said 
mrs koller said the four teenagers and other friends taking 
part in the contest had been going from one shanty to another much 
of the night checking for possible catches at each tipup an 
apparatus that holds a hook and line and hoists a flag when a fish 
bites 
she said she had not been worried about her daughter because her 
husband and 18yearold son also were on the lake and she knew her 
daughter was with her friends and relatives 
the parents all knew that these kids were out there said 
jadowski they were good kids very fishing and huntingoriented 
so they had the blessings of their parents and the parents knew 
exactly where they were 
sarahs brother scott and another friend found the four victims 
about 610 am mrs koller said 
the girls father was in the shack right next door he tried 
mouthtomouth resuscitation said mary lee stueck another 
contest organizer 
the sporting group observed a moment of silence and members bowed 
their heads and prayed for the dead teens during the clubs award 
ceremony sunday night august stueck said

ted koppel said he welcomed a study released 
today that found his latenight news show nightline favors 
white conservative men as guests but he added the reports authors 
were wrong to criticize the show 
the guest list merely reflects the government that nightline 
covers he said 
the study of almost 2500 guests on more than 850 episodes of the 
abctv show found that 89 percent were men and 92 percent were white 
it also found that the 9yearold news interview program 
virtually ignored labor unions environmental and consumer 
advocates antiwar activists the working class and those who 
oppose us foreign policy 
i like studies like this koppel said im happy to see 
them whether they are from the right or the left they do give us 
an opportunity to reexamine what we do how we do it 
and sometimes its quite true we get into a rut 
the survey commissioned by the liberal media watchdog group 
fairness amp accuracy in reporting was conducted by boston college 
sociologists william hoynes and david croteau 
nightline which has won two dozen emmys and is seen by more 
than 5 million viewers nightly is widely perceived as one of 
televisions most influential news programs 
the findings challenge nightlines reputation for 
impartiality said jeff cohen executive director of fair 
when you see the same pattern week after week it becomes a 
political bias cohen said 
although welcoming the study koppel challenged its implications 
i think fair makes a great mistake when it concludes that 
simply by looking at a guest list you know what the substance of 
that program was koppel said we are accused of putting on the 
establishment yes we are guilty that is what we do 
he said his guest selections simply reflected former president 
reagans conservative appointees and that a liberal administration 
would yield a biased guest record in the opposite political 
direction 
what you do is bring on the architects of us foreign policy 
and hold them to account which is what we try to do on this 
broadcast koppel said 
and never is it suggested that i might ask the guests a tough 
question once in a while never is it even suggested that if you 
want to critique us foreign policy you dont bring on the 
opponents of us foreign policy and let them speak their minds 
nightline executive producer richard kaplan also criticized 
the study but conceded that it pointed out a narrow focus regarding 
guests 
kaplan said he gave copies of the report to his staff 
the study examined 40 months of nightline episodes from 
january 1985 to april 1988 
the analysis showed that the shows most frequent guests were all 
conservative leaders 
former secretaries of state henry kissinger and alexander haig 
topped the list with 14 appearances each followed by television 
evangelist jerry falwell and former state department official 
elliott abrams with 12 appearances each

an estimated 15 million hindus holy men 
from their himalayan cave homes naked recluses from forest dens and 
ordinary pilgrims from across india began immersing themselves at 
the confluence of two sacred rivers today 
todays bathing is the high point of the sevenweek kumbh mela 
festival which according to the guinness book of world records is 
the largest religious gathering on earth 
the ceremonial bathing began at 4 am with the blowing of conch 
shells and the chanting of hymns by the faithful who believe a dip 
in the rivers on this astrologically auspicious day will free them 
from the cycle of reincarnation and allow them to achieve salavation 
hindus believe that lord brahma creator of the world in the 
hindu religion and a member of the supreme trinity in the pantheon 
of hindu gods awakens at 4 am and therefore the day should start 
at that hour 
the kumbh mela is celebrated every 12 years according to the 
lunar calendar at the time of a rare planetary convergence jupiter 
in taurus the sun and moon in capricorn and a series of 
complicated calculations of hindu astrology 
but today takes on added significance for it is also the day of 
the new moon another good omen 
two people died in the early hours of the mass bathing a 
50yearold man collapsed on the river bank after his bath and soon 
died and a woman drowned when her boat capsized according to a 
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity in 1954 about 
800 pilgrims died in a stampede at the holy festival 
either these people are crazy or there must be something we 
cant see or understand said nina marshall a 23yearold student 
from berkeley calif who was among dozens of americans that came to 
see the religious spectacle 
it is vibrating she said pointing to the barefoot pilgrims 
trekking to the junction of the ganges and jamuna rivers 
for the faithful the bathing is often a onceinalifetime 
opportunity 
i planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop 
said sarju mahato a farmer from bihar state as he tended the 
blisters on his two sons feet we saved money and came here 
the festival takes the name kumbh mela from a story in hindu 
mythology in which a god seized a pot of nectar that made gods 
invincible in their war against the demons kumbh means pot and 
mela means fair 
a drop of nectar from the pot is thought to have fallen at 
allahabad where the ganges and jamuna rivers come together a bath 
at the exact spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring 
salvation from the cycle of birth and rebirth 
the bathing at the kumbh mela began with processions of holy men 
their order determined from days of yore according to the importance 
of their sects dipping at the confluence of the ganges the yamuna 
and the mythical swaraswati 
the swaraswati cannot be seen but hindus believe it flows 
beneath the earths surface where the two other rivers meet 
there was color everywhere a profusion of saffron scarlet 
white and gold robes 
some holy men wore only loincloths some had their foreheads 
smeared with vermilion and sandalwood paste and some wore garlands 
of basil wreaths around their necks wrists and arms 
some had shaven heads others matted hair tied in knots atop 
their heads 
the nagas or naked recluses smeared their bodies with 
ashes they wore garlands of marigolds around their necks and blew 
conch shells to drive away evil spirits 
they danced holding spears lances staffs and small rocks 
representing some of the hindu faiths 32 million gods and goddesses 
there were camels draped in brightly embroidered cloths adorned 
with feathers beads and mirrors with bells on their feet that 
tinkled when they walked 
some pilgrims pulled chariots holding the holiest of the holy 
men who offered blessings to the others 
the bathing followed the initiation of new nagas young men are 
inducted into the naked order only once every 12 years during the 
kumbh mela 
on sunday 1500 nagastobe shaved their heads burned their 
clothing and performed their last rites 
from this moment they have renounced the material world and 
since they will not depend on anyone anymore they themselves 
perform their last rites as if they are already dead from this 
world explained mp ashnata the fairs chief spokesman

a 3year separation has ended for sharon 
kowalski and karen thompson lovers forced apart following a 1983 
automobile accident that left miss kowalski severely braindamaged 
and in her fathers custody 
its been a pretty emotional reunion ms thompson said 
sunday in a telephone interview from kowalskis bedside at a 
hospital in duluth weve had a wonderful weekend and she wants me 
to be here as often as possible 
ms thompson a st cloud state university professor who lived 
with kowalski for four years before the november 1983 accident last 
saw kowalski on aug 19 1985 when donald kowalski used his power 
as his daughters guardian to deny her visiting rights 
kowalski 58 a retired taconite miner said ms thompsons 
visits were detrimental to his daughter sending her into 
depression he said he doubted ms thompson had a lesbian 
relationship with his daughter and denied visitation partly because 
he feared ms thompson would sexually abuse his daughter 
kowalski and ms thompson have been fighting in court over who 
should be able to care for miss kowalski since she came out of a 
coma five months after the accident which was caused by a drunken 
driver 
she has been in various nursing homes and hospitals since the 
accident and has lost the use of her limbs with the exception of the 
fingers on her right hand she whispers but communicates most of 
the time by shaking her head or typing on a computer 
ms thompson has charged that donald kowalski and his wife 
della have not provided adequate care even though it has been 
directed by a physician the kowalskis say ms thompson exaggerates 
their daughters ability to communicate and her potential for 
rehabilitation 
ms thompson 41 was allowed to see miss kowalski 32 under an 
order from st louis county district court judge robert campbell 
the judge has consistently upheld kowalskis guardianship rights 
but in december he overruled kowalski by ordering a reevaluaton of 
miss kowalski to determine how soundly she thinks and what her 
potential is to express her feelings about who should care for her 
according to the judges order anyone would be allowed to see 
her if she reliably requested to see them ms thompson was 
granted supervised visits because miss kowalski reliably 
requested to see her in interviews with a psychiatrist ms thompson 
said 
its really good to have private time with sharon again she 
said i think sharon is soon going to let everyone know that she 
can control her own future 
donald kowalski said he was angered that thompson was allowed to 
visit his daughter 
its just not right what theyre doing but theres nothing i 
can do kowalski said she thompson has been proven harmful to 
sharon 
i dont believe sharon reliably wants to see karen thompson

after last weeks meeting of the group of seven industrialized 
countries failed to break the markets bullish sentiment foreign 
currency dealers said gold prices also rose 
trading was thin as chinese new year celebrations in asia and 
carnival celebrations in parts of west germany kept many operators 
out of the market dealers said 
they said the market is ready to buy dollars because inconclusive 
comments from the group of seven industrialized countries in 
washington did not convince it to do otherwise 
however they said the general bullishness is dampened by fears 
that central banks might stage another round of concerted 
interventions 
the central banks have failed to reverse the trend all they 
can do is slow down the momentum said one dealer at a swiss bank 
in frankfurt the markets inclination to take in dollars is still 
very strong

as the soviets leave afghanistan a correspondent 
from the aps moscow bureau joined a military convoy as it covered 
the final miles to the border he filed this report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a convoy of soviet troops roared home 
today from afghanistan to a brassband reception waving flags and 
stuffing red carnations into the muzzles of their submachine guns to 
mark the end of their countrys involvement in the war 
the 350th parachute regiment which had been stationed in 
afghanistan since 1984 rumbled across the friendship bridge 
spanning the amu river and into termez red flags waving and 
headlights lit 
soviet officials brought about 150 foreign correspondents to this 
border town in soviet uzbekistan for the welcoming ceremonies or 
one for every two soldiers who returned 
the 300 paratroopers commanded by lt col alexander skachkov 
were presented with red carnations which they pushed down the 
barrels of the weapons on their armored vehicles and into the 
muzzles of their guns 
a 20piece military band played the national anthem and martial 
airs 
the tanks armored personnel carriers and armored cars that 
carried the returning soldiers held banners proclaiming peace to 
you afghanistan and the order of the fatherland has been 
fulfilled 
among the hundreds of termez residents to meet the returning 
airborne regiment was maria sabriba who found her grandson eldar 
galiev in its ranks 
the diminutive womans face lit up as she told reporters she had 
seen her grandson she said he had written a letter saying he was in 
mongolia rather than afghanistan so that she wouldnt worry about 
him 
at least hes healthy she said beaming 
the convoy was one of the last rolling north to the border as the 
soviets extricate themselves from their more than nineyear 
involvement in the afghan war under a unbrokered accord signed 
last year all soviet troops are to be withdrawn from afghanistan by 
feb 15 
the kremlin intervened in 1979 to prop up the marxist government 
in kabul but its troops fought to a costly stalemate the soviets 
say more than 13000 red army soldiers were killed in the conflict 
and many troops and veterans express anger and frustration at the 
outcome 
valery sudarenkov first deputy prime minister of uzbekistan 
welcomed the soldiers home saying we wish you to join the front 
ranks of those fighting for revolutionary change in soviet society 
but as the convoy logged its last miles in afghanistan on sunday 
soldiers expressed ambivalence about the purpose of their military 
intervention and uncertainty about the shaky prosoviet government 
they left behind 
the soviet policy in afghanistan brought nothing said tank 
commander andrei yevryolin speaking to foreign reporters who rode 
for an hour atop his tank 
at a military outpost near the northern afghan city of 
mazarisharif 30yearold capt arkady anonich bluntly answered 
no when asked if he thought the local people supported the 
government of president najib 
he told journalists the kremlins decision to send soldiers to 
afghanistan had been illconsidered 
there should have been another way to settle this conflict 
he said

a proposed 3 billion airport which survived one 
election and appeared ready to fly last spring has run into 
turbulence again 
the new airport which would be the first such major project 
planned in the united states since dallasfort worth international 
airport opened in 1974 is again the subject of debate and faces 
the threat of a second referendum 
meanwhile federal investigators are looking into the dealings of 
some land developers associated with the project 
i am frustrated with this state and this community not getting 
its act together we can debate ourselves to the tail end of the 
line said gov roy romer 
my frustration with the city of denver is for gods sake 
youve been working on this for seven years and sent me and some 
others out to represent you to a neighboring county adams and 
then whoops the rug came out from under us 
romer and other proponents including denver mayor federico pena 
contend the airport scheduled for a july groundbreaking will ease 
a projected national air transportation crush and boost colorados 
sagging economy stapleton international airport is too small and 
has a flawed runway design they say 
opponents including the two major airlines that serve denver 
have called the new airport a waste of money engineered by fat 
cats and point to declining traffic at stapleton in the last two 
years 
the squabbling could cost the city federal funds that would help 
build the airport the city has asked the federal government for 
500 million to help offset the estimated 17 billion cost of the 
first phase of construction 
adams county voters agreed last may to annex land northeast of 
denver to the city for the airport pena ordered a national 
advertising campaign that boasted the worlds largest airport is 
now off the ground and promised the new airport would be 
operational by the mid1990s 
three months later the city sued continental and united airlines 
for judicial approval to use stapleton revenue to help finance the 
new airport 
and then in january former denver democratic party chairman dick 
young and former state sen bill chenoweth spoke out against the 
citys plans reviving the opposition and threatening to start a 
petition drive to put the issue to a vote a newspaper poll showed 
most residents favored a second referendum 
young said the decision to build the new airport instead of 
expanding stapleton was made in the closed rooms and the 
boardrooms and the hidden rooms by the people who are going to make 
the money off what i consider the greatest boondoggle of all time 
at the heart of the investigation by the fbi and the 
transportation department is an alleged cash payment of 2500 to 
former adams county commissioner steve cramer from a developer weeks 
before cramer helped rezone a key parcel of land near the new site 
cramer denied receiving the payment and said the decisionmaking 
that went into the airport plan was too complex to be manipulated 
the denver city council has scheduled a feb 21 vote on whether 
to endorse the new airport 
the airport ultimately will need approval from the federal 
aviation administration which also would provide federal funding 
the faa has supported construction of the new airport to help ease 
future crowding in the nations transportation system 
the faa released a draft environmental impact statement last week 
that approved the new airport based on environmental protection 
agency findings 
the epa said it still had some reservations about the new site 
including the possibility of increased air pollution 
faa officials said they expected to issue a final environmental 
impact statement this summer and will decide before then whether to 
approve denvers airport layout plans

frigid air cloaked the nation today turning highways into icy 
demolition derby courses leaving snow in unlikely places and 
forcing a camp of nudists in texas to decide they couldnt bare it 
the arctic front that spilled out of alaska last week remained 
stalled over virtually the entire nation forcing temperatures below 
normal just about everywhere but florida forecasters said relief is 
at least several days away 
in arkansas churches canceled sunday services to spare 
worshipers the danger of traveling on icy roads public schools 
throughout central and northern texas as well as at least two texas 
colleges canceled classes today for the same reason 
the weather has contributed to at least 40 deaths in the lower 48 
states since the air spread from alaska on tuesday 
among the latest victims were three people killed sunday night on 
icy roads in kentucky and a man who froze to death beneath a freeway 
overpass in salt lake city earlier in the day 
accidents on slick roads also were blamed for four deaths in 
louisiana including two people who died when an 18wheel truck spun 
out of control on an icy bridge just east of monroe and rammed their 
vehicles 
in addition four teenagers competing in a wisconsin icefishing 
derby were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning sunday after they 
left propane heaters running overnight in a wooden shanty the 
overnight temperature near frozen harpt lake was about 16 below zero 
a texas boy died at a grand junction colo hospital late sunday 
after being trapped beneath an avalanche earlier in the day two 
other boys were buried but managed to escape from the snowslide at 
mount crested butte in the central rockies

degrees shattered a 100yearold record elsewhere it was 1 degree 
in chicago denver and minneapolisst paul 5 in st louis 6 in 
albuquerque nm and 8 in salt lake city 
on sunday low temperature records were reached in at least 26 
cities from the pacific to the plains 
in denver it was 24 below zero the citys coldest temperature 
in 26 years at 1 pm the thermometer crept to 1 degree breaking 
a 70hour streak of subzero cold the nations low sunday was 46 
below zero at wisdom mont 
it was minus 21 at south lake tahoe calif and parts of the san 
francisco bay area remained coated in snow astonishing longtime 
residents 
you could only find a scene like this on a postcard said 
timothy waters a 77yearold ranch resident at the point reyes 
national seashore just north of the golden gate its just 
extraordinarily beautiful our family cant remember snow like this 
in 40 years 
persistent snow in chicago forced the temporary closure of midway 
airport and the closure of two runways at ohare international 
airport causing 40 flight cancellations and numerous delays 
it just wont stop complained kirsten svare a spokeswoman 
for chicagos department of streets and sanitation it just keeps 
coming 
cool drizzly weather in new orleans didnt stop 11 scheduled 
mardi gras parades but it did contribute to sales of hot drinks in 
bourbon street bars 
thank god it did get a little bit colder said toni reyes 
manager of the seaport bar as soon as it rained it pushed 
everyone inside 
freezing rain was reported early today across the eastern 
seaboard from delaware to virginia and south and west across ohio 
kentucky tennessee northern mississippi and into the texas gulf 
coast and central texas 
in decatur texas 60 miles northwest of dallas members of the 
bluebonnet nudist park couldnt keep their clothes off sunday as 
temperatures were in the teens and low 20s 
unfortunately we nudists have to put it on hold for a few 
days said manager arthur moss as nudists were generally a 
sensible lot 
nudists and sensible conformists will be bundling up for at least 
the next few days according to harry gordon of the national weather 
services severe storms forecast center in kansas city mo 
however he added storms brewing in the southwest could spell 
relief of sorts for the rest of the country later in the week 
if the storms begin to push north and east they could bring more 
seasonable temperatures to the middle of the country gordon said 
but they also would bring more snow or rain 
as karl williams of the weather service in chicago said who 
knows when it snows it snows and when it doesnt it doesnt

a rise in racist violence by young 
skinheads shows that hate crime is a bigger problem than we 
ever suspected the head of a national monitoring group says 
pat clark the director of klanwatch said skinheads helped 
revive the white supremacist movement in 1988 a report released by 
her group today said white youth gangs attacked blacks homosexuals 
jews asians hispanics and indians last year 
blacks were victims of 56 percent of the hate crimes reported to 
klanwatch in 1988 jews were victims of 27 percent the other 17 
percent fell into other categories the report said 
the report also said skinheads were linked to murders in 
portland ore san jose calif las vegas and reno nev and 
twothirds of the racial assaults documented by klanwatch last year 
klanwatch monitors white supremacist activities for the southern 
poverty law center 
the report gives a representative sample of hate crimes during 
1988 including 193 incidents in 35 states but statistics in the 
report are incomplete since no national data collection system 
exists said ms clark 
she said the lack of national data has tended to disguise the 
threat of violence however she said the tremendous rise in 
skinhead crime as well as the evidence from states who do have data 
collection laws clearly shows hate crime is a bigger problem than 
we ever suspected 
the report cited a growing recruitment campaign by white 
supremacist groups 
old guard racists are organizing violent teen gangs into a 
national network the report said although many skinheads reject 
racism a hardcore group openly espouses white supremacy and 
violence 
not since the height of klan activity during the civil rights 
era has there been a white supremacist group so obsessed with 
violence or so reckless in its disregard for the law according to 
the report 
in the slayings in portland and reno black men were killed by 
assailants who apparently picked their victims at random the report 
said 
in san jose klanwatch said a 24yearold white man was fatally 
stabbed when he attempted to step between a skinhead and a black man 
at a party after the skinhead began making racial slurs 
in las vegas two skinheads who shared an obsession with satanism 
walked into a convenience store and fatally shot the 21yearold 
clerk in the face for no apparent reason the report said 
it added that the racist gangs represent a unique and 
frightening phenomenon in the history of white supremacism in 
america 
police in urban areas around the country were confronted last 
year with a violent new generation of racists whose weapons include 
baseball bats and their own heavy steeltoed boots and whose crimes 
ranged from gang beatings to murder ms clark said

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said today his talks with pakistani officials failed to 
come up with a solution for peacefully ending the afghan war but he 
said soviet soldiers would not reenter the battle 
shevardnadze also told a news conference before leavng for the 
airport that his visit helped pave the way for a continuing dialogue 
with pakistan which with the united states has backed moslem rebels 
fighting afghanistans sovietbacked government 
shevardnadze spoke as the last red army units were reported on 
their way home after nine years of involvement in the civil war 
between the kabul government and the guerrillas who call themselves 
mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
under a un accord all soviet troops are to be out of the 
country by feb 15 
contrary to reports from guerrilla sources who said sunday the 
soviet official would meet with the pakistanibased guerrillas 
shevardnadze said no such meeting occurred asked why not he said 
i never expressed any desire any request to meet with the 
mujahedeen there was no request from their side either 
he said any attempt to form a stable government in kabul 
following the soviet troop withdrawal would fail if it doesnt 
include the marxists 
whether you like it or not the pdpa is the most powerful force 
in afghanistan he said 
shevardnadze also pledged moscows continued support of the kabul 
government but he ruled out any reintroduction of soviet troops 
if new complications happen if there is continued and rising 
tension we will have to recall that the soviet union has 
obligations to the republic of afghanistan shevardnadze said 
he added we are not thinking of any soviet reentry into 
afghanistan 
shevardnadze said the last red army troops would be out of the 
country within a week 
the communists seized power in afghanistan in a 1978 coup soviet 
forces intervened in 1979 to replace one promoscow government with 
another then remained to fight the growing insurgency by moslem 
guerrillas 
shevardnadzes visit the first to pakistan by a soviet of his 
rank was seen as a lastditch effort to forge a political solution 
to the war before the soviet pullout 
afghan president najib has insisted his forces are strong and 
able to defend the country 
however the rebels claim najibs mainly conscripted army is 
demoralized and will defect to the rebels in large numbers once the 
soviets are gone 
shevardnadze who arrived early sunday had talks with his 
pakistani counterpart sahabzada yaqub khan as well as prime 
minister benazir bhutto and president ghulam ishaq khan

the boston society of young professionals has 
staged eight fundraising parties in the last 18 months but often 
failed to donate the profits to the charities in whose name the 
parties were conducted according to a published report 
the society a looseknit group of stockbrokers lawyers and 
other professionals is under investigation by attorney general 
james shannon after two charities complained they had received no 
money the boston sunday herald reported 
a suffolk superior court judge ordered a bank account for the 
society frozen last week but there was no money in that account 
according to assistant attorney general joanna soris who is 
handling the case 
the eight parties grossed up to 75000 but the amount donated 
to charity was 3565 or about 5 percent of the gross proceeds the 
newspaper reported 
our concern is to break even and if we have any money left 
over we give it to charity jeffrey southmayd 29 who heads the 
society told the paper there was no answer at southmayds home 
sunday 
the attorney generals investigation is still in the discovery 
process and soris said no decision has been made yet as to whether 
statements for the bank account should be subpoenaed 
its not our goal to chill charitable giving said soris but 
a charitable party she said should be a cooperative effort and 
you have to have the charitys interest first 
hundreds of young professional singles flocked to the parties 
which were billed as benefits for charities including the jimmy 
fund the us olympic swim team the american cancer society and 
the pine street inn 
businesses also donated drinks and hotel rooms on the assumption 
that proceeds from the functions would go to charity the newspaper 
reported 
a benefit party for the special olympics last month raised 1300 
for the charity but only after a bostonbased special olympics 
official karyl resnick threatened the society with legal action 
resnick called the societys methods underhanded she said 
they werent on the upandup with us people were thinking they 
made a donation to a charity when in fact they were paying for these 
people to have a big shindig 
the party had promised the opportunity to meet such stars as 
former bruin bobby orr and former yankee tommy john but resnick 
said there was not one celebrity there 
at a super bowl party held last month to benefit the pine street 
inn only 105 of the 250 guests paid admission the herald said the 
event grossed 3225 but expenses were 6000 resulting in a net 
loss of 2775 the newspaper said 
the quality inn donated a room worth 2000 and a 600 drinks 
discount for the party on the assumption that proceeds would 
benefit the pine street inn said the hotels food and beverage 
director bert patterson however the pine street inn has received 
no donation the herald said 
the pine street inn and the american cancer society were not 
informed in advance that their names would be used for the events 
the newspaper said public charities law forbids the unauthorized 
use of a charitys name in connection with any solicitation

china said today that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will visit from may 15 to may 18 for the first summit 
between the two countries since they split over ideology and 
strategy 30 years ago 
the official xinhua news agency also issued a joint 
chinesesoviet statement on cambodia containing points of agreement 
between soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his chinese 
counterpart qian qichen in meetings here last week 
in the statement both leaders said they support a vietnamese 
troop pullout from cambodia by september with strict 
international supervision and an end to chinese aid to cambodias 
antivietnamese guerrillas 
they said they still differed over the composition of a 
transitional government in cambodia from the current 
vietnameseinstalled hun sen regime to a popularly elected 
government xinhua said the two sides will continue to discuss their 
differences 
china apparently considers the cambodian problem close enough to 
resolution to go ahead with a chinesesoviet summit one of its 
conditions for a summit has been a vietnamese withdrawal from 
cambodia after a decade of occupation 
the soviet news agency tass announced sunday the summit would be 
held may 1518 xinhua did not say why the chinese foreign ministry 
waited more than 24 hours after shevardnadze ended his visit to 
announced the date 
the summit between gorbachev and chinese leader deng xiaoping 
will officially normalize relations that turned hostile in 1960 
trade cultural and other exchanges have increased sharply in the 
past few years especially since gorbachev became soviet communist 
party head in 1985 but china has held back on normalizing political 
ties 
aside from cambodia two other chinese conditions also seem 
resolved the soviet union is to complete its troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan this month and it has pledged to sharply reduce its 
troop presence along the chinese border

greek and american officials today began 
another round of talks on the future of four us military bases 
here 
the officials refused comment on the start of the fourday talks 
the 14th since negotiations began in late 1987 little progress has 
been made in the negotiations 
a fiveyear operating agreement for the installations expired 
december 20 under terms of the old accord the united states has 17 
months to reach a new agreement or dismantle the bases 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said at the end of last 
months talks that negotiators were no further than the preamble 
stage of a new accord and that a disagreement of views continues 
to be observable 
the resignation last week of rear adm christos limberis from the 
greek negotiating team was expected to create further delays until 
his replacement is found limberis chief of naval operations is 
being groomed to take over as naval chief of staff military sources 
said 
another reason for the slow pace is the socialist governments 
insistence that a new agreement provide assurances the united states 
will help solve the countrys disputes with turkey 
the two neighboring western alliance members have been at odds 
over military control of the aegean sea its seabed mineral rights 
and the cyprus problem 
american officials have said they dont want to involve regional 
politics in the bilateral talks 
premier andreas papandreou beset by a series of embarassing 
financial scandals is also expected to use the bases issue to 
attract leftist votes in the june elections 
papandreou has already said he plans to shut down one of the 
bases adjacent to athens international airport and hold a referendum 
on the remaining installations 
four major us bases have been operating here since the early 
1950s two are near athens and two are on the island of crete

the president of the teachers union said he 
would recommend a strike vote this week because contract talks with 
the nations secondlargest school district are at a standstill 
it was an absolute waste of time said wayne johnson 
president of united teacherslos angeles after eight hours of 
negotiations ended sunday night 
johnson said the talks narrowed differences on pay hikes but 
failed to solve the escalating labor dispute 
state mediator draza mrvichin had brought representatives from 
the union and los angeles unified school district together at noon 
sunday in hopes of settling the labor dispute which is beginning to 
be felt by the districts nearly 600000 pupils talks broke off at 
midevening 
teachers have been working without a contract since june 
johnson said union members would vote on a strike this week and 
predicted a strike was imminent but he was not specific on the 
timing of any possible strike which would be the first in the city 
since 1970 
the stalemate has triggered student protests and threats of 
lawsuits by parents on friday teachers withheld thousands of 
student grades from the district passing them out instead on union 
report cards 
negotiations are scheduled to resume wednesday 
teachers had sought a 12 percent pay raise this year while the 
district offered a 174 percent hike over three years 
during the talks the union offered to reduce its 198889 school 
year salary increase demand from 12 percent to 11 percent for the 
year with a 10 percent hike next school year 
the district meanwhile raised its offer to 20 percent over 
three years and possibly as much as 24 percent with an 8 percent 
increase the first year officials said 
board president roberta weintraub said the boards new offer 
would raise beginning teachers salaries to 28000 top pay would 
be 50000 
as far as i can see its our last offer i cant see anything 
beyond this she said

a park avenue physician says hes still getting 
new patients despite allegations that his prescription of cocaine to 
treat pain is medically unsound 
the new york daily news reported sunday that the state health 
department has been investigating dr milton reder 89 for 
administering cocaine to patients without a physical examination or 
referrals 
health department officials have said the amount of cocaine reder 
administers through cottontipped swabs placed in the nose is 
roughly equivalent to a dose of street cocaine and could lead to 
addiction 
the new york county medical society contends the treatment has 
no basis in scientific medicine 
why should these people suffer reder asked sunday ive 
got about 20 new people who want to be treated he said his phone 
didnt stop ringing after the story appeared 
reders patients have included singer sonny bono and comedian 
david brenner 
bono mayor of palm springs calif said sunday he was unaware 
whether reder used cocaine to cure his excruciating back pain in 
1968 but had no qualms about recommending him to friends 
i guarantee youd get less drugs from him than you would from a 
general doctor bono said in a telephone interview from his home 
bono said he had recommended the treatment to brenner who had 
chronic back pain 
i dont think its any illegitimate practice hes not 
trying to turn you into an addict or anything like that bono said 
reder calls cocaine the best local anesthetic there is but 
says hell shift to another substance if necessary

smoggy sky to greet the year of the snake early today but city 
residents didnt stint on traditional feasting and drinking 
people jammed stores over the weekend preparing for the lunar 
new year which the communist government dubs spring festival in an 
effort to rid the holiday of traditional superstitions 
the year of the snake for example is regarded as unpredictable 
because the reptile is considered cunning 
as the clock struck midnight colored rockets and sparklers burst 
from every street the cacaphony lasted half an hour but it was 
only a dim echo of fireworks fusillades of the past which went on 
for hours 
the government sharply cut back the fireworks supply this year 
allocating 30 percent less to beijing to try to reduce fires and 
accidents beijing also banned firecrackers from central tiananmen 
square and hundreds of other public locations shanghai banned them 
altogether from the downtown area 
lunar new year is chinas combination of christmas and new 
years a time for visiting family feasting giving gifts and 
reflection last year the year of the dragon brought the highest 
inflation in more than three decades the countrys worst drought in 
memory and the most deadly earthquake since the last dragon year

representatives of solidarity and the 
government today began unprecedented talks on the future of the 
trade union movement and changes in polands political system 
solidarity leader lech walesa led his 25member delegation into 
the conference hall and grinned as he took his seat at the round 
pine table 
just before 2 pm polish television began a special live 
broadcast to show the 57 representatives of the government 
solidarity the official trade union opzz the peasants party the 
democratic party and the roman catholic church taking their seats in 
the namiestnikowski palace 
we were brought together here by the sense of responsibility 
for the future of our motherland we are all responsible for the 
poland to be interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak told the 
participants the staterun pap news agency reported 
pap said the talks officially began at 223 pm when television 
concluded its coverage 
the talks are the first between solidarity as an organization and 
the government since the union was suppressed by the martial law 
crackdown in december 1981 it was outlawed a year later 
official representatives included kiszczak politburo member 
stanislaw ciosek and alfred miodowicz the leader of the official 
trade union alliance opzz 
walesa was accompanied by his close adviser tadeusz mazowiecki 
and wladyslaw frasyniuk the solidarity leader in the southwestern 
city of wroclaw 
walesa said earlier he was optimistic about the talks 
im happy im in warsaw and i will be even more happy if we 
break the first ice im an optimist he said today we 
will discuss general problems but solutions to the main problems 
will be made at the technical tables 
kiszczak first proposed the talks in august 1988 while strikes 
spread across poland in the countrys worst labor unrest in seven 
years 
the crucial issues concern the reinstatement of solidarity and 
electoral reforms that could allow the opposition representation in 
government 
we would like solidarity to be legalized as quickly as possible 
and we would like it done all at once said historian bronislaw 
geremek a solidarity delegate to the talks 
solidarity actvists remain skeptical about the outcome of the 
talks and reluctant to accept a political role 
both sides agree that compromise is urgently needed if the poles 
are to extract themselves from end an economic crisis that has 
spawned 60 percent inflaction and chronic consumer shortages 
poland is trying to cope with a 39 billion foreign debt an 
obsolete industrial base and the exodus of many talented young 
people to the west 
kiszczak and walesa met six times to set up the talks but walesa 
refused to commit solidarity until authorities agreed to legalize 
the union 
in a dramatic reversal of its stand against the movement it 
banned in 1982 the communist partys governing central committee 
last month approved a plan to conditionally reinstate solidarity 
the union movements leaders then agreed to take part in the 
talks 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski has suggested solidarity 
observe a strike moratorium as part of the agreement to legalize the 
union 
we wont abandon the right to strike but we declare solidarity 
will search at any cost to avoid strikes geremek said we 
accept that conflict must be avoided but we cannot accept it at the 
loss of our identity 
the authorities have signaled a willingness to allow 
representatives of the constructive opposition to run for 
parliament but the opposition does not believe that the communists 
have any intention of sharing power 
hence opposition leaders say they would be reluctant to run for 
parliament or accept cabinet posts 
the party demands solidarity be a trade union but it insists 
solidarity become politically engaged geremek said the key 
problem on the elections will be between those who want to reproduce 
their power and those who want free elections 
solidarity also says it wants to discuss reform of the legal 
system to create a more independent judiciary freedom of clubs and 
associations access to the mass media democratization of local 
government at smaller round tables 
both sides have expressed the desire to conclude the talks 
quickly

the energy department is privately urging 
energy companies to take extra precautions against terrorism in 
part out of concern that libya or iran might strike at key us 
energy facilities 
in addition the national security council has created a special 
interagency task force to assess the vulnerability of domestic 
energy systems and to study possible us responses to a wide 
variety of energy emergencies at home and abroad 
energyrelated terrorism in the united states would be a 
particularly significant threat in a military crisis involving the 
soviet union said an internal energy department report obtained by 
the associated press 
however even in the absence of a superpower confrontation 
there is the possibility that potential third world adversaries 
could sponsor attacks on the energy infrastructure in the united 
states the report said 
the report was prepared in december 1987 to describe the early 
stages of the departments accelerated effort to improve national 
energy security it was deemed too sensitive to make public 
although a sanitized version was presented to congress last year 
and a similarly limited edition was published last month 
electric power companies considered the most vulnerable segment 
of the energy industry have begun acting on the energy departments 
antiterrorism warnings according to sources familiar with ongoing 
discussions between industry and government 
but other energy businesses including the oil industry have 
been reluctant to join the program according to the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the report said a natural disaster such as an earthquake or 
disruptions of world oil supplies are more likely to cause a 
national energy emergency but that a terrorist incident would be 
more serious 
among the initiatives taken to improve coordination with private 
energy companies was a program of special security training for 
company officials at the energy departments central training 
academy at albuquerque nm the report said 
a key reason for the initiative according to department 
officials and documents is growing concern about 
technoterrorism the use of hardtodetect plastic explosives 
handheld missiles electronic surveillance gear or other 
sophisticated devices to carry out politically motivated acts of 
sabotage 
the heightened alert also reflects a fear of retaliatory strikes 
by libya and iran countries accused by the united states of 
supporting terrorism the sources said american bombers attacked 
libya in april 1986 and iranian oil facilities in the persian gulf 
were hit by us forces in october 1987 and april 1988 
taking its cue from the energy department the nuclear regulatory 
commission last december imposed new measures to strengthen 
protection against possible terrorist attacks at the few facilities 
it oversees that handle weapongrade nuclear materials however the 
measures were not applied to nuclear power plants which also are 
under nrc jurisdiction 
the energy department report said the most vulnerable segment of 
the energy system is the electric power grid which is stretched 
across long distances in many remote unprotected areas repairing 
or replacing critical power plant components such as generating 
stations can take weeks or months it said 
less vulnerable but still a source of concern are oil 
refineries and offshore production facilities oil and natural gas 
pipelines and coal transport links 
in 1987 an army special forces team acting as terrorists staged 
a moch attack that knocked out power substations an emergency 
operations center and valves of the strategic petroleum reserve in 
louisiana and texas the energy department says it is tightening 
security for the oil stored against an embargo 
the report noted that serious power disruptions have been carried 
out by terrorist organizations in western europe and parts of africa 
and south america 
in the past these attacks generally were poorly designed and 
executed but recent attacks by the same organizations have shown a 
higher level of technology and better planning the report said 
edward v badolato deputy assistant secretary for energy 
emergencies told congress last year that the energy department 
began passing on intelligence agency threat advisories in 1987 
to key industry trade organizations he gave no details however 
badolato declined to be interviewed on the subject he is 
scheduled to testify about the program wednesday before the senate 
governmental affairs committee 
the internal energy department document said the threat 
advisories are transmitted to organizations such as the american 
petroleum institute the american gas association the national coal 
association and the north american electric reliability council the 
groups then pass on the warning to their members the report said 
a source said the advisories are issued during a heightened state 
of international alert such as the july 1988 downing of a civilian 
iranian airliner by the uss vincennes 
gene gorzelnik director of communication at the electric 
council confirmed that his organization was working with the energy 
department to assess security but would provide no details 
it feels as if anything that is said about it may give them 
terrorists some hints or bring others out of the woodwork 
gorzelnik said 
officials said some industry executives have raised concern about 
possible antitrust and conflictofinterest problems in cooperating 
directly with the government 
as far as the oil industry is concerned there are some major 
concerns about antitrust said marshall w nichols executive 
director of the national petroleum council 
robert kupperman a leading private authority on energyrelated 
terrorism said a successful terrorist attack on us facilities is 
immensely feasible but that industry executives are balking at 
the energy department program because they dont want to admit 
their vulnerabilities 
theyre being dragged into it by the scruffs of their necks

a former judge convicted last year of 
perjury as part of a scandal involving three state supreme court 
justices was reprimanded publicly by the court after finding her 
also guilty of judicial misconduct 
the supreme court on friday accepted a recommendation by the 
judicial conduct board that former chittenden county assistant judge 
jane wheel be found guilty of failing to conduct herself in a manner 
befitting a judge the public reprimand is the harshest punishment 
possible because she is no longer a judge 
wheel and former justices william hill thomas hayes and ernest 
gibson iii were charged in january 1987 with 25 counts of 
misconduct the case has caused a major backlog in the supreme court 
as the justices disqualified themselves from hundreds of cases in 
order to avoid potential conflicts of interest 
the charges included allegations that wheel and hill had their 
arms around each other in an inappropriate display of affection in 
the courthouse and that the justices tried to block an attorney 
generals investigation of allegations that wheel falsified pay 
vouchers and used county funds to throw a party for hayes 
wheel and the three justices denied any wrongdoing the case 
against hayes was dropped when he died the one against gibson was 
dropped when he conceded some of his actions could have been 
construed as inappropriate the conduct board in march found hill 
guilty of five counts of misconduct and dismissed six others the 
supreme court has not acted on his case 
wheel was convicted last year of three counts of perjury brought 
because of the probe into the pay vouchers she was sentenced in 
june to 45 days in jail and 1500 hours community service the 
sentence is delayed pending appeal 
in the misconduct case conduct board prosecutors and wheel 
agreed in november that she would not contest the single 
discourteous behavior charge and the prosecutors would drop all 
others the board said it would accept the plea agreement because 
the judiciary had endured enough scandal 
wheel who was voted out of office in 1986 maintains her 
innocence and stipulated only that others might have construed her 
actions as inappropriate according to her attorney leonard wing

an israeli teenager avoided airport security 
booths at bengurion international airport and boarded a jet bound 
for paris before being caught without a ticket an airport spokesman 
said today 
the security breach occurred sunday morning as former 
intelligence agents and airline officials from around the world 
gathered outside tel aviv for an israelisponsored conference on 
aviation security 
airport authority spokesman menachem eyal said the 16uearold 
boy who walked into the airport and onto the plane did not carry a 
weapon and apparently meant no harm but was apparently deranged 
eyal said the youth was caught by stewards when he failed to 
produce a ticket or boarding pass after boarding the boeing 707 
eyal said the aircraft belonged to the israeli arkia company 
the boy was turned over to police eyal added 
we are still investigating what happened it is clear that 
something very wrong happened an apparent security breach we will 
take the necessary steps against whomever is found guilty eyal 
said 
it was the second such incident at an israeli airport in two 
months 
in december a 3yearold girl wandered onto a civilian plane at 
an air force base in southern israel that is also used for charter 
flights she was caught moments before the plane took off for 
copenhagen 
at the conference near tel aviv titled the first international 
seminar on aviation security leading antiterrorist experts and 
police from the united states are expected to deliberate methods to 
improve protection from hijackings and bombings 
the issue of airport security has been particularly sensitive 
since the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland all 
259 people on the jet and 11 people on the ground died

the productivity of american workers increased 
14 percent last year the government said today matching the 
average gains of the six previous years but falling short of the 
growth needed to meet the forecast on which president bush is basing 
his budget 
increased productivity getting each worker to produce more each 
hour he or she is on the job is vital to economic growth without 
inflation particularly given the current squeeze in the labor 
market 
but the labor department reported nonfarm productivity was 
unchanged in the fourth quarter of 1988 and was up 14 percent for 
the year that marked an improvement over 1987 but was exactly in 
line with the 14 percent annual average in productivity gains since 
the end of the 198182 recession 
output in the nonfarm sector was up 51 percent for the year 
but average hours worked climbed 36 percent the departments 
bureau of labor statistics reported 
manufacturers reported a 32 percent productivity gain for 1988 
down from 34 percent in 1987 productivity in the business sector 
dropped 20 percent in the final quarter of 1988 and ended the year 
up 10 percent 
the productivity report came as the federal reserve board 
prepared to set monetary goals for 1989 and as bush readied his 
budget proposals for delivery to congress later this week 
fed chairman alan greenspan is expected to seek to tighten the 
central banks reins on credit to ease inflation that would run 
counter to the economic forecast of nearly 3 percent annual growth 
that former president reagan included in his final budget and that 
bush has adopted for his amended spending plan 
one possible way for the economy to grow at 3 percent a year or 
more without an inflationary surge in wages would be through 
significant productivity gains something on which the reaganbush 
economic forecast relies 
the forecast assumes productivity gains averaging 19 percent a 
year which along with the projected growth of the labor force would 
allow for potential economic growth of 32 percent a year 
some economists have attacked the rosy projections of the 
budgets economic forecast they say productivity gains which 
averaged just 06 percent a year between 1973 and 1981 and 14 
percent since then are too difficult to predict

foreign minister moshe arens today accused the 
palestine liberation organization of breaking its promise to refrain 
from terror and indicated israel will ask the united states to end 
its dialogue with the plo 
in jerusalem police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on the 
main shopping street of the citys arab sector to disperse several 
dozen palestinian stonethrowers who smashed cars and shop windows 
a teenager was reported injured 
two days ago we had an example of a terrorist act by a branch 
of the plo arens said in a speech to the new yorkbased 
conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations 
he cited a clash saturday in which israeli troops killed five 
palestinian fighters on the northern border of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in south lebanon 
the radical plo factions of george habashs marxist popular front 
for the liberation of palestine and the syrianbacked palestinian 
liberation front said their guerrillas were on a mission to attack 
israeli positions 
arens said the action clearly and unequivocally violated us 
conditions for opening talks with the plo after a 13year boycott 
i presume that in washington they also noticed what happened 
but to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed we will 
draw his attention to it arens added on israel radio after the 
speech 
a foreign ministry official later said israel is calling on 
the united states to reconsider the dialogue considering that the 
plo the habash faction took responsibility for the attempt to 
penetrate israel 
us officials shocked israel by opening talks with the plo in 
december after plo chairman yasser arafat renounced terrorism and 
said he accepted israel 
israel argues the plo has not changed its objective of destroying 
the jewish state israeli officials note arafats mainstream fatah 
faction has refrained from attacks but express doubt that arafat can 
control other more militant plo factions 
seymour reich head of the jewish conference of presidents said 
he too would pressure the bush administration to end contacts with 
the plo 
im not sure the administration is prepared to cut off the 
dialogue yet reich said on israel radio but were going to 
press them on these issues and remind them that these terrorist 
acts are continuing 
in a speech sunday prime minister yitzhak shamir said israel 
would never allow a palestinian state to exist and branded 
palestinian people brutal wild alien invaders in the land of 
israel 
in the occupied territories meanwhile israeli troops today shot 
a 15yearold palestinian girl in the thigh arab hospital officials 
said gaza strip residents were on strike for a second day to 
protest the deaths saturday of two palestinian youths shot in 
clashes with troops merchants shuttered their shops and students 
went home 
the army said it was checking the report about the girls injury 
since the december 1987 start of the uprising 373 palestinians 
and 15 israelis have been killed

foreign minister ali akbar velayati said 
today iran will continue to export its islamic revolution but not 
by force and that better relations with the united states are 
possible only if washington changes its hostile stance 
we have a concept and we are going to continue the policy to 
export the revolution velayati told a news conference but this 
doesnt mean were going to export the revolution with a gun 
he also said iran and iraq will resume direct peace talks to end 
their eightyear war soon but that there would be no progress 
unless iraqi troops were withdrawn from iranian territory 
iran has been restoring relations with western countries and its 
arab neighbors as part of a policy aimed at ending a decade of 
selfimposed isolation 
but the tehran hierarchy is deeply divided over the issue of 
restoring links with the united states severed in 1979 
except for the palestineoccupying regime and the racist south 
african regime and precluding american sabotage we desire good 
relations with other countries of the world velayati said 
speaking in the foreign ministrys ornate audience hall in front 
of a lifesized portrait of iranian spiritual leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini velayati said the export of irans revolution 
would be cultural 
as you do in western countries youre trying to make other 
people in the world to be westernoriented he said were going 
to do the same on the basis of our islamic beliefs and concepts 
the news conference was attended by scores of foreign 
correspondents in tehran to cover celebrations marking the 10th 
anniversary of the revolution 
tehrans socalled pragmatists led by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani have made it clear that with the aug 20 ceasefire in 
irans war with iraq iran has backed off the militant export of its 
fundamentalist revolution 
velayati said the peace talks were deadlocked and will be 
useless unless iraq withdraws its troops from iranian territory 
if iraq adopts a stubborn attitude and refuses to retreat the 
talks will get nowhere he said 
velayati gave no date for resuming direct talks with iraq which 
broke off in november over the issue of troop withdrawals 
however he and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz are due in new 
york this week for talks with un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
the iranians have charged that iraq still holds about 390 square 
miles of their territory 
iraq has refused to withdraw until it gets a guarantee of freedom 
of navigation in the persian gulf and until the shattalarab 
waterway its main passage to the gulf is cleared of sunken ships 
and other war debris

state officials are studying a proposal to deny 
parole to illiterate inmates in an effort to motivate them to learn 
to read gov roy romer says 
i believe we have got to overcome the problem of illiteracy 
romer said in an interview with the denver post published today 
weve got people in prison we need to rehabilitate and one of the 
tools for rehabilitation is learning to read 
im trying to think of ways we can motivate or discipline 
people into using that time to acquire the skill of reading 
if colorado cannot constitutionally require literacy as a 
condition for release romer said he hopes to develop other 
incentives 
of colorados 6000 prison inmates 55 percent do not have a high 
school degree or its equivalent more than 27 percent read below a 
seventhgrade level according to a survey of 2938 inmates 
conducted a year ago 
experts believe many exconvicts wind up back behind bars because 
they dont have the skills to get and keep a good job 
one proposal would require that illiterate inmates successfully 
complete literacy classes before they are allowed to take 
higherpaying prison jobs said herman abeyta of the corrections 
department 
at the present prisoners enrolled in academic programs earn just 
56 cents a day while those with jobs earn 80 cents a day or more 
under a pilot program established by the legislature in 1988 100 
inmates at buena vista correctional facility and colorado womens 
correctional facility earn an extra four days a month off their 
sentences for participating in literacy programs 
people are staying in the programs longer than they were before 
without any incentives abeyta said money and reduction in time 
are the two big issues in prison

the judge at oliver norths trial scheduled a 
closeddoor hearing today reportedly to hear concerns of the 
intelligence community about classified information in the 
irancontra case 
us district judge gerhard a gesell scheduled the hearing as 
the jury selection process resumed and the judge added two people to 
the pool of prospective jurors bringing the total to 34 
he rejected three others including a woman who knew someone who 
was on a grand jury that has investigated the irancontra affair 
another woman rejected for the pool said she heard it in passing 
it was all over the news 
one woman sent into the jury pool is an office clerk who said she 
recalled seeking a july 1987 magazine with norths picture on the 
cover but didnt recognize north in the courtroom and when asked 
whether she had heard of him said no i never have 
another woman approved for the jury pool said she had seen north 
on television in his marine uniform that drew objections from north 
attorney barry simon who suggested she had been exposed to the 
fired white house aides immunized congressional testimony in 1987 
gesell however said that while she saw she did not listen to 
what was being said 
gesell scheduled the closeddoor hearing at the request of the 
head of the prosecution team john keker who apparently was acting 
on behalf of the intelligence community in the bush administration 
gesell said only that the hearing would deal with objections by 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh to one of my 
earlier orders it was understood that the matter pertained to 
classified information 
keker said walsh and a representative of the justice department 
wanted to be at the hearing to which gesell readily agreed 
responding i have been trying to get the department of justice 
here without too much success 
last thursday keker asked on behalf of the justice department 
and intelligence agencies that they be provided with four seats in 
the courtroom during the trial gesell agreed but said he was 
concerned that security gurus would try to run the case 
the national security agency made strong objections late last 
month to attorney general dick thornburgh over classified 
information that would be presented in the case and said it 
warranted blocking the trial thornburgh rejected the nsas 
suggestion 
gesells remarks today came as 39 additional prospective jurors 
were sworn in some of whom will undergo questioning on how much 
they know about north and the irancontra affair if they were not 
exposed to norths immunized congressional testimony in 1987 they 
likely will be placed in a pool from which a jury is to be chosen 
later this week 
 
thirtyfour people have been approved for the jury pool since the 
trial began last tuesday and gesell wants to have a group of 45 from 
which to choose 12 jurors and six alternates 
the jury pools lack of knowledge and interest in the 
irancontra affair marks them as unusual out of the first 104 
jurors who came into the courtroom just 31 said they hadnt 
watched listened or read about norths 1987 testimony to congress 
in which he detailed many of the activities for which he is now 
accused of crimes 
a number of the prospective jurors who were approved for the jury 
pool by gesell have said they recall hearing somewhere about 
shredding of documents in connection with the irancontra affair or 
north but recall nothing more than that 
three counts of the 12 criminal charges against north allege that 
he destroyed documents to conceal aid to the contras and the reagan 
administrations sale of arms to iran 
most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance at 
frontpage newspaper headlines and switch channels or dont pay 
attention when the news comes on 
they said they are too busy with jobs or occupied with other 
interests to have paid much attention to the biggest foreign policy 
debacle of the reagan administration 
most are blue or pinkcollar workers several with the 
government while several others are unemployed or retired one 
woman is holding down two jobs 
of the first 25 prospective jurors a dozen finished the 12th 
grade one has a masters degree two others finished college and 
another has some college education 
their occupations range from cement finisher to mental health 
administrator 
north is accused of allegedly concealing from congress in 1985 
and 1986 his efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contras and of 
covering up from the attorney general the national security 
councils role in diverting money from the iran arms sales to the 
contras 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with contributions to the contras

civil rights leader jesse jackson said today 
his rainbow coalition has signed an agreement with soviet officials 
to have an international telethon to raise resources for 
earthquakedevastated armenia 
jackson who returned recently from a sixday visit to the soviet 
union said on abctvs good morning america that he found 
conditions in armenia in the wake of the dec 7 quake really 
incomprehensible 
weve signed an agreement between the rainbow coalition the 
minister of culture the minister of radio and television to have an 
international telethon on june 10 jackson said from chicago the 
program would link armenia moscow and perhaps britain and 
america to raise resources to build churches houses hospitals and 
schools 
the rainbow coalition is jacksons national political group 
socalled because its aim is to encompass people of every race 
what is needed right now jackson said is prefabricated 
housing and just as many people have sent trees to israel as a 
concrete way of making a statement people or groups may want to 
send prefabricated housing to armenia or they may want to send 
direct contributions to the church 
the aftermath of the earthquake he said is an excellent 
opportunity for us as a nation to penetrate and to build good will 
within the soviet union and between our two countries 
jackson said that during his visit i made an appeal on the 
basis of human rights to release some soviet jews and they released 
four while we were there he did not elaborate last thursday he 
said in moscow that he did not know the names of four jewish 
refuseniks granted permission to leave the country 
however his spokesman frank watkins said today in chicago that 
the four are boris vladimirovich kagan of leningrad alexander 
veniaminovich mestechkin of moscow evgenia abramovna feldshtein of 
moscow and vladimir mihailovich civkin of leningrad 
watkins said the four have been given permission to leave the 
soviet union eric easter a press aide who accompanied jackson to 
moscow said soviet officials did not say when the four would be 
allowed to leave the country but they would be given freedom of 
movement immediately 
the former democratic presidential candidate said the earthquake 
presents a challenge to glasnost or openness in the soviet union 
to their restructuring of their priorities 
i think we must monitor their words we must verify their 
commitments we must also match their deeds as they move toward 
disarmament and move toward third world development and ending third 
world conflicts jackson said 
i think its a tremendous opportunity and we ought to match it 
and seize it

in most cajun towns masked horsemen celebrate 
mardi gras as they have for hundreds of years with a riotous ride 
from farm to farm to scare up some chickens and other ingredients 
for a huge pot of gumbo 
but in teemamou a town of about 400 people deep in cajun 
country the courir du mardi gras has used trucks since 1919 
the year the horses died 
they were running pretty hard it was rek 
said larry g miller teemamouiota mardis gras folklife festival 
associations folklikind of a long tfe director they ended up running 
across a 
blue norther that was blowing in right at the end of their run 
they got to the farmhouse to do their gumbo and tied the 
horses up 
when they went out later about twothirds of the 28 horses had 
died from pneumonia brought on by the sudden chill after a long hot 
run 
it sobered up a lot of mardi gras early and it busted up the 
dance said miller using mardi gras as folks do in these 
parts to mean those who participate in the drunken ride 
since that night in teemamou a town so small it seldom shows up 
on maps of acadia parish the courir has been made by truck a 
flatbed at first and now on a specially made wagon drawn by a 
pickup my miller said the only words that are both in 
their song and our song is we come from england thats kind of 
curious 
that reference in frenchspeaking southern louisiana may be to 
englands tradition of costumed peasants begging in hard times or to 
the acadians flight from nova scotia after it became english 
territory he said 
after the chant and some dancing things get really wild 
they break out and run all over the place chasing chickens and 
getting whatever charity they can get out of the farmhouse said 
larry miller 
theyll frequently go in to scare the womenfolks or children 
its kind of customary for the women and teenage girls to be 
deathly afraid of the mardi gras and little boys as well he 
said its kind of an ongoing thing from generation to generation 
you grow up scared of the mardi gras 
later on you become one of them

president bushs point man for ethics policy 
c boyden gray is resigning as chairman of a multimilliondollar 
communications company to avoid any appearance of conflict of 
interest the white house said today 
gray bushs official legal counsel since 1981 previously had 
said he would remain as chairman of the familyowned summit 
communications group inc but would refuse a salary 
he resigned effective today after consulting with the heads of 
bushs new ethics commission said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said the action was prompted in part by news accounts 
over the weekend in the new york times and the washington post that 
pointed out that the reagan white house had a policy that forbade 
employees from serving in such chairmanships or earnign outside 
income 
fitzwater said there would have been nothing inappropriate 
about gray keeping the post in the bush administration but he said 
gray was advised to resign by former attorney general griffin bell 
and federal appeals judge malcolm wilkie chairman and vice 
chairman respectively of the newly created presidents commission 
on federal ethics law reform 
the duties of the white house counsel are sufficiently broad 
that it would be constructive to resign such a directorship to avoid 
any possibility of even the appearance of conflict fitzwater told 
reporters 
he said gray also would be putting his personal assets into a 
blind trust the washington post estimated grays investments at 10 
million 
bush has made a major point in his presidency of stressing high 
ethical standards for government employees and said he wants 
tougher ethical rules than those he inherited from his predecessor 
president reagan 
boyden gray has the presidents highest trust and confidence 
and he will remain the primary adviser to the presidnet on ethical 
matters fitzwater said 
bush was aware that every year for the past eight years when gray 
worked for him as vice president the office of government ethics 
reviewed and approved grays financial disclosure forms he said 
the reagan white house had a policy that no white house officials 
should accept outside earned income or serve on the boards of 
outside corporations frank q nebeker director of the office of 
government ethics said sunday this policy was mentioned in a 1983 
written advisory opinion by the ethics office that was distributed 
to all government ethics officials including gray the times said 
gray was not bound by those rules when he worked for the vice 
president whose policy was more lenient and he was paid several 
hundred thousand dollars over the eight years for serving as 
chairman of the company that owns at least a dozen radio stations 
and has about 130000 cable subscribers in the south 
he reported the income on his financial disclosure forms more 
recent forms have also disclosed payments for his work as 
coexecutor of the estate of his father who died in 1982 
gray told the newspapers that he stopped accepting payment from 
summit for his work at the beginning of the year 
due to my promotion and due to the policies enunciated by 
bush during the presidential campaign i cannot and i will not 
take outside income and so have instructed the family company he 
said 
bush made a campaign pledge in july that his appointees would not 
accept any outside income but he did not address the problem of 
serving on outside corporations boards 
last week bush appointed an eightmember commission to review 
government ethical standards including conflictofinterest law 
bush has not yet named a white house ethics officer but gray has 
been serving informally in that role since before the inauguration 
gray who has an unpublished telephone number could not be 
reached for comment sunday according to the white house his 
deputy john p schmitz as suffering from back problems and was 
unavailable said schmitz mother 
gray told the post that he has avoided conflictofinterest 
problems by recusing himself since 1981 from any matters concerning 
communications he also said he had no conflict because he was not 
summits chief executive or operating officer he said he devoted 
four to six days a year to overseeing the company 
nintythree percent of the companys stock is owned by a trust 
administered by gray and his brothers the times reported 
nebeker declined to say what gray should do about his 
chairmanship of summit to meet white house ethics standards saying 
im not prepared to make any suggestions to him at all 
peter f watson who worked with gray on presidential transition 
matters defended gray on sunday 
all i can say is during the several meetings i participated in 
with him and his staff dealing with ethics issues i have never seen 
anybody more concerned not only with strict compliance with ethics 
issues but indeed nobody was more sensitive as to the appearance 
issues as well watson said 
specific communications issues did come up during transition 
and he immediately advised everyone in the room that he was not to 
be involved in those issues said watson an attorney who now 
works for the overseas private investment corp i personally 
witnessed him removing himself from any deliberations for 
appointments on the fcc 
timothy muris who worked on the fcc transition also attested 
sunday to grays recusal from communications matters boyden never 
had any conversations with me about the fcc he said 
nebeker said he met with gray on numerous occasions after the 
november election and before the inauguration to discuss matters 
concerning ethics and grays financial disclosure 
i apprised him of the existence of the 15 percent rule a law 
under which officials above a certain salary are prohibited from 
earning an amount equal to more than 15 percent of their government 
salary in outside earned income such as wages or other compensation 
nebeker said interest and dividends are not included 
nebeker said that while gray had not been at that level before 
hes at it now because his salary has increased

the public outcry over the proposed 51 percent 
pay increase for members of congress should hardly be surprising 
americans have been objecting to congressional pay raises for 
nearly all of the 200year history of the senate and house of 
representatives 
alexis de tocqueville a close observer of american life offered 
an explanation in his 1835 study democracy in america 
his conclusion democracies are far more stingy than other forms 
of government when it comes to paying highranking officials 
part of the reason de tocqueville wrote is that a salary level 
which seems inadequate to the official receiving it appears 
enormous to him whose wants do not extend beyond the necessities of 
life 
when he reflects on own humble dwelling and the small earnings 
of his hard toil he remembers all he could do with a salary which 
you judge insufficient and he is startled and almost frightened at 
the view of so much wealth he said 
more than 150 years later little has changed 
we have never had a satisfactory method for setting 
compensation for high government officials says senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine we still do not 
if contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant the 
pay of members of congress today would be the same as it was in 
1789 
the root of the problem is in the constitution 
article i section 6 provides senators and representatives 
shall receive a compensation for their services to be ascertained 
by law and paid out of the treasury of the united states 
that sounds well enough in theory 
but in practice it leaves the question of congressional pay 
levels up to congress itself posing an always sensitive 
uncomfortabe and sometimes politically explosive problem 
some of the framers of the constitution thought it would give 
members of congress a license to steal others argued that pressure 
from incensed constituents would rein in greedy impulses 
the issue has always been approached gingerly at best 
bringing up the pay raise issue is about as welcome in a 
legislative body as a skunk is at a sunday school picnic says 
sen charles e grassley riowa 
the first major american squabble over a proposal to raise the 
pay of members of congress arose in 1816 and it set back the early 
political career of daniel webster who later was to become a famous 
orator senator and secretary of state 
from the convening of the 1st congress in 1789 until 1816 a 
27year span members of congress were paid at the rate of 6 a day 
with attempts made from time to time to dock the pay of absentees 
in 1816 congress ended the daybyday payments and adopted an 
annual salary of 1500 a year 
the result public outrage 
nine members of congress resigned and several were defeated in 
the 1816 elections 
webster was one of those ousted in the payraise revolt 
it took him until 1822 to persuade the voters to send him back to 
capitol hill 
the 1500 annual salary also was a casualty it was repealed in 
1817 and the next year congressional pay was set at 8 a day 
eight dollars a day remained congressional pay for the next 38 
years 
the idea of an annual salary finally prevailed in 1854 when the 
compensation for members was set at 3000 a year 
congressional pay rose to 5000 a year in 1865 
but when congress acted in 1871 to boost the total to 7500 
annually the voters rebelled again 
the higher salary had been made retroactive to the beginning of 
the 42nd congress two years earlier in effect giving members a lump 
sum windfall of 5000 
congress already was besieged by accusations of corruption the 
new pay increase brought cries of salary grab and backpay 
steal 
members could not take the heat and when the 43rd congress 
convened dozens of bills were introduced to repeal the increase 
congressional salaries soon were rolled back to the 5000 level 
where they remained until 1907 a period of 33 years 
congressional pay was cut twice during the depression of the 
1930s 
salaries which had reached 10000 by 1925 were reduced to 
9000 in 1932 and to 8500 the next year but they have been 
growing slowly ever since 
the present congressional salary 89500 
the proposal by an independent commission increase it to 
135000 to more nearly approach the compensation offered in the 
private sector to lawyers corporate executives and others with 
similar responsibilities 
the senate has already rejected the raise 950 the house may or 
may not act 
the prospects as usual are highly uncertain

a new program to help firsttime michigan 
homebuyers meet their down payments will be formally proposed this 
week gov james blanchard said today 
in his state of the state speech tuesday blanchard said he will 
propose the home ownership savings trust program similar to the 
states program to help parents save for their childrens college 
costs 
i think this program will not only work but sweep the 
country blanchard said 
the program will let wouldbe firsttime buyers of homes invest 
small sums each month in michigan revenue bonds for three to 10 
years they would earn taxfree interest on their savings 
when enrolling in the program they would declare what price 
range house they were seeking and would save toward a down payment 
for a house in that range 
the state would guarantee them enough money for a down payment on 
a house in the declared price range no matter how much housing 
prices might increase during the time the wouldbe buyers are 
saving the governor said 
the plan is modeled after the michigan education trust in which 
parents invest with the state for their offsprings college 
educations the state then covers costs at state universities 
regardless of how much tuition may increase by the time the children 
are old enough for college 
in his address tuesday blanchard will also outline a 
workfare program aimed at getting ablebodied persons age 18 to 
25 off the dole 
this is not a budgetcutting measure its a longterm 
investment babcock said if we dont do something to have these 
people enter the labor market they have a greater chance of 
longterm dependency

with navajo officials under which they paid him 64269 for the 
flights 
hansen said his company arranged seven or eight charter flights 
for macdonald and his family who live on the navajo reservation in 
northeastern arizona including trips to boston to attend a 
daughters graduation from harvard

the illicit use of drugs in the us armed 
forces has declined even more than had been indicated last summer by 
preliminary results of a worldwide survey the pentagon said monday 
use of marijuana declined from 65 percent in 1985 to 29 percent 
last year while use of other illicit drugs dropped from 58 percent 
in 1985 to 31 percent in 1988 the defense department said in a 
statement 
the overall figure for the use of any drug dropped from 9 percent 
in 1985 to 48 percent in 1988 the pentagon said 
cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use also declined and the 
survey found that almost 80 percent of military personnel took 
some action within the past year to improve their nutrition the 
pentagon added 
last july based on some preliminary results from the same 
survey the pentagon projected 1988s overall illegal drug use rate 
at 55 percent the additional drop to a rate of 48 percent is 
based on final tabulations of statistics from military outposts 
around the world the pentagon said 
the 1988 survey is the fourth conducted since 1980 when the 
pentagon began attacking a drug problem within the ranks that had 
become almost out of control in 1980 the defense department 
discovered more than a quarter of its military personnel 276 
percent admitted using drugs illegally 
the pentagon responded with a variety of tougher disciplinary 
sanctions including dismissal from the service and launched a 
program that now subjects every man and woman in the military to 
random urine testing for drugs 
the worldwide surveys are not part of the disciplinary program 
however they are conducted every three years in strict 
confidentiality to chart what if any progress is being made 
as finally tabulated the 1988 survey concluded that cigarette 
smoking and use of other tobacco products dropped significantly 
between 1980 and 1988 
cigarette use declined from 51 percent in 1980 to 409 percent 
in 1988 heavy smoking smoking one or more packs a day declined 
from 342 percent in 1980 to 227 percent 
on the use of alcohol the level of heavy drinking defined as 
consumption of five or more drinks at least once a week also 
continued an eightyear decline in 1980 the survey found 141 
percent acknowledging heavy alcohol use that figure is now down to 
82 percent the pentagon said 
the 1988 survey conducted for the pentagon by the research 
triangle institute involved the completion of lengthy 
questionnaries by 18673 men and women in the service

president andres rodriguez today denied 
reports linking him to drug trafficking and said he will try to 
curtail cocaine shipments through his country 
also today rodriguezs office announced that elections to choose 
a new president and congress will be held may 1 
the army general who took power in a coup friday also said his 
overthrow of gen alfredo stroessner was necessary for the sake of 
the country but he said stroessner might be allowed to return from 
exile in the future 
stroessner who ruled for 34 years as president and 
commanderinchief of the armed forces left paraguay on sunday to 
the jeers of dictator get out he was in a remote farming town 
in central brazil and the brazilian foreign ministry said today he 
would remain there indefinitely 
i detest drugs rodriguez said i swear as a catholic and 
as a family man i swear on my children i have no connections with 
drugs rodriguez told the associated press 
at a news conference earlier at the national palace he said 
allegations he protects or sponsors drug shipments were spread by 
people trying to defame me 
he said he would cooperate with foreign governments and agencies 
including the us drug enforcement administration to curtail the 
flow of illegal drugs through paraguay 
rodriguez said he ousted stroessner because the general was not 
producing good results for his party which had trusted him 
the remark was an apparent reference to jockeying for power and 
infighting between prostroessner militants within the ruling 
colorado party and those who wanted to distance the group somewhat 
from the 76yearold stroessner 
rodriguez 65 added he was not a dictator his situation is 
being studied by the court system he could come back in two or 
three years he has gone for a rest in brazil 
he dismissed reports from diplomatic sources and local media that 
casualties from fighting during the coup topped 300 believe me 
total casualties dead plus injured do not exceed 50 he said 
the government has issued no official tally 
as soon as rodriguez was sworn in friday talk began about 
allegations he allowed drug traffickers to use paraguay to move 
cocaine out of south america 
the buenos aires herald commented in an editorial saturday 
there are reasons to link him rodriguez to the rampant 
corruption and even the drug trafficking under the stroessner 
regime yesterdays events the coup might not improve the 
system and could even make things worse if rodriguez becomes the 
manuel noriega of the region 
noriega panamas military ruler was indicated on drug 
trafficking charges in the united states last year he has denied 
the allegations 
a highranking foreign diplomat acknowledged rumors that 
rodriguez allowed traffickers to use an airstrip he owns near the 
border with bolivia but said absolutely no proof of that has 
ever been offered 
stroessner flew to campinas 290 miles southwest of rio de 
janeiro then took a brazilian air force plane to the rural town of 
itumbiara 800 miles northwest of rio a brazilian foreign ministry 
communique said 
the deposed dictator accompanied by a son and daughterinlaw 
three security guards a brazilian diplomat and 12 aides was 
staying in a guest house owned by the governmentrun furnas electric 
company the communique said 
brazilian ambassador orlando carbonar told the associated press 
that his nation granted stroessner asylum on humanitarian grounds 
stroessner owns a beachfront mansion in the atlantic coastal resort 
of guaratuba 
the new government quickly promised democratic reforms including 
allowing opposition parties to participate in elections 
one opposition leader suggested that elections be delayed because 
his group and others needed time to organize to have any chance of 
defeating the entrenched colorado party which has been in power 
since 1940 
if gen rodriguez is realistic he should stay in power for a 
minimum of two years and make changes in the electoral law that will 
permit the organization of parties and then call elections on the 
basis of equality said fernando levi rufinelli of the liberal 
party

apparently no one told the presidents 
military police about his press conference 
so it was a little surprising monday when the raucous reporters 
who were invited into lopez palace for the first news conference 
with a paraguayan leader in anyones memory ran headlong into the 
armed guards outside an ornate ballroom 
brandishing their brazilianmade assault rifles the guards in 
green uniforms white helmets and ascots chased the correspondents 
away from the ballroom the site of the news conference 
soon however the nervous aides to president andres rodriguez 
who seized power in a military coup four days ago cleared up the 
mixup with the guards the reporters were led into the ballroom 
there amid colonialstyle chandeliers historic oil paintings 
and the oriental rugs was a table and a large upholstered chair for 
the president from which to preside at the unprecedented news 
conference 
gen alfredo stroessner the dictator overthrown friday by 
rodriguez never held an actual news conference in his nearly 35 
years in power he rarely would meet with small groups of 
journalists but oldtime paraguayans could not recall any former 
leader taking direct uncensored questions from reporters 
perhaps that was why the paraguayans seemed so unprepared 
there was no microphone or public address system for the 
president no place for tape recorders and no platform for tv 
cameras 
the journalists furiously began stringing wires and cables and 
they jostled for places around the table furniture was rearranged 
and reporters who couldnt get near the nment officials pleaded get 
away from the table leave the 
chairs along but the reporters who had gathered at the downtown 
palace at 6 am and had waited hours for the news conference 
jammed in closer 
authorities then announced rodriguez would meet with reporters in 
small groups downstairs in his office 
that sent the pack swearing in several languages surging out 
of the ballroom and back toward the redcarpeted staircase 
once more the mps moved in finally journalists in bunches of 
five to 10 got to meet rodriguez 
standing behind a mahogany desk wearing a dark business suit and 
fiddling with goldframed glasses the 65yearold general calmly 
answered touchy questions on drug trafficking political 
persecution car theft and harboring international criminals 
his edgy aides apparently thinking that anything simmilar under 
stroessner would have meant bad consequences for the questioner 
stared stoically at the walls 
but rodriguez smiled and thanked the journalists warmly for 
coming pleading fatigue the aides said he could not meet with 
about 50 to 75 more correspondents still jammed in the entrance hall 
there was no word about the next presidential news conference

a man accused of slaying 14 family 
members before he went on a rampage in an arkansas town and killed 
two other people went on trial today as jury selection got under way 
r gene simmons 48 already is on death row after his murder 
conviction in may for the dec 28 1987 shooting of two people in 
russellville including a woman said to have refused his romantic 
advances 
the new trial is for the shooting and strangulation deaths of 
simmons wife becky 46 their seven children two of the 
childrens spouses and four of simmons grandchildren one of whom 
relatives say he fathered by one of his daughters they were killed 
in the days before the shootings at russellville 
officials had summoned 90 persons today as potential jurors by 
noon two had been chosen for the jury a 22yearold housewife and 
a 76yearold retired civilian employee of the air force 
one of the 90 didnt make it to court this morning and three 
others were excused during preliminary questioning jury selection 
was continuing 
the current trial was moved from russellville to clarksville 
because of pretrial publicity circuit judge john s patterson 
addressed that issue when he asked the potential jurors is there 
anybody who has not heard anything about this case nobody raised 
their hand 
patterson told them he realized that he cannot make you just 
wipe things out of your mind and forget it but that courtroom 
verdicts must be based upon a higher quality of evidence than what 
is reported in the media 
earlier today the defense made an unsuccessful motion to let the 
jury decide whether the deaths of simmons relatives were part of 
the same criminal episode as the shootings in russellville 
the defense had argued that to try simmons for the 14 killings 
after he has already been convicted of the two deaths in 
russellville violates his right not to be tried twice for the same 
crime patterson denied the motion to let the jury decide the issue 
just as he had earlier rejected the argument himself 
simmons was arrested in russellville after a 40minute shooting 
spree in which he wielded two 22caliber revolvers wounding six 
people at four businesses two of those victims died 
authorities went to simmons house and after several hours 
broke into the house because the only door was barred from the 
inside but no one answered they found five bodies in the house the 
next day they dug up seven bodies from a grave and found two more 
bodies both babies in the trunks of cars parked on simmons land 
it was the worst mass murder in state history and one of the 
worst in us history 
prosecutor john bynum said he would ask for the death penalty 
patterson who presided over simmons earlier trial will preside 
again and has decided that the prospective jurors will be questioned 
onebyone to help ensure that a fair jury is chosen he followed 
the same procedure in simmons trial in ozark where a jury was 
chosen in 1 days 
defense lawyers robert e doc irwin and john c harris said 
jury selection in the new trial may take three days 
not only can you not find 12 people in johnson county who 
havent heard about the case you cant find 12 people in arkansas 
or maybe even the united states harris said 
at the end of his first trial simmons startled patterson by 
waiving the right to appeal and asking to be executed as soon as 
possible 
let the torture and suffering in me end simmons said 
but his june 27 execution date was set aside because a roman 
catholic priest opposed to capital punishment the rev joseph 
franz filed motions contending that simmons was incompetent that 
his decision to waive his appeal rights was not a knowing and 
intelligent act and that an appeal was mandatory 
the state supreme court turned down franz on all three points 
ruling that appeals were not mandatory if the defendant wanted to 
waive them and that simmons was both competent to do so and did so 
knowingly and intelligently 
a federal court in little rock is considering one aspect of 
franzs argument whether the waiver was a knowing and intelligent 
act

house speaker jim wright bowing to opponents 
of a 51 percent congressional pay raise announced today he would 
order a roll call vote on the issue tuesdy before the boost can take 
effect 
the majority has spoken and the majority will speak even more 
emphatically tomorrow the majority will rule he said 
rep william gray dpa chairman of the house democratic 
caucus predicted their would be no pay raise no change in the 
lawmakers 89500 salary 
wright dtexas made the announcement from the house floor after 
opponents of the 45500 increase won a key procedural vote on the 
subject defeating an effort by the democratic leadership to adjourn 
the house until tuesday 
an attempt to adjourn is normally such a routine procedure that 
it does not require a roll call vote but in this case one was 
ordered and its rejected on a 23888 vote that showed opponents 
held the upper hand 
the pay raise is scheduled to take effect at 1201 am on 
wednesday the senate already has voted against the raise 
the vote and wrights subsequent announcement came after majority 
leader thomas foley dwash who was presiding over the days house 
session refused to recognize a payraise opponent who wanted to 
introduce a resolution calling for a vote on the hike 
that set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debate 
between the two sides 
rep arthur s ravenel rsc said the house was engaging in a 
shameful pay raise conspiracy by taking a money without voting 
for it 
but rep david obey dwis accused unnamed house members of 
hypocrisy by speaking out publicly against the raise and 
indicating privately that they wanted the money 
rep barbara boxer dcalif said she was going to be watching 
public opponents of the raise carefully to see whether they pocket 
the money i hope the press will be watching added rep john 
dingell dmich 
the proposed congressional pay is part of a package that would 
increase the salaries of federal judges as well as senior officials 
and managers in the executive branch for members of the house and 
the senate the increase would amount to a raise from 89500 to 
135000 a year 
it was not immediately clear whether the vote that wright set for 
tuesday would affect the recommended increases for judges and 
administration officials 
wrights decision to order the vote capped a remarkable retreat 
for the speaker 
as recently as last week he insisted there would be no vote on 
the pay raise he attempted to lessen the political damage by 
spreading the word that the house would vote swiftly on legislation 
that would ban payment for honoraria for speeches and impose other 
curtailments on outside compensation 
later in the week he conducted a private survey of house members 
and said the results showed they did not want a vote before the 
raise took effect despite that random surveys by the associated 
press and other organizations showed that sentiment was in favor of 
a vote 
by late last week wright had said he would seek to scale the 50 
percent pay raise back to 30 percent while banning honoraria 
throughout the maneuvering house republican leaders lent their 
silent support to wrights efforts to avoid a vote minority leader 
robert michel rill sat silently in his seat on the house floor 
during todays debate and vote 
the senate voted 955 last thursday to reject the entire raise 
for congress and other top federal officials but it will become law 
automatically wednesday under a special procedure unless the house 
also turns it down 
the raise would apply to congress top bush administration 
political appointees and judges but the constitution prevents 
reduction of judges pay once they receive a raise 
under wrights proposal to let the raise become law 
rankandfile lawmakers would see their salaries rise wednesday from 
89500 to 135000 the speakers plan would scale that back to 
116350 
the senate already has voted to offset the 51 percent raise 
partially by banning honoraria while the higher pay is in effect 
the house plans to pass its own package to ban speaking fees and 
limit other outside income 
public reaction to the congressional pay raise has been 
overwhelmingly negative dozens of protesters shouting no pay 
hike read our lips and hey mr speaker havent you heard 
50 percent is quite absurd sunday night met democratic house 
members returning to union station from a weekend retreat at the 
luxurious greenbrier resort in west virginia 
the lawmakers had earlier wondered aloud whether any strategy 
would satisfy the public and let them keep a pay raise 
itll sort of be like andy warhol said well be rich for 15 
minutes said rep gary ackerman dny 
while lawmakers wrestle with their own pay this week theyll 
also be working on solutions to protect the money that millions of 
americans have in shaky savings and loans about 350 insolvent sampls 
remain operating after regulators rescued 205 last year with 
promissory notes and loss guarantees 
bush met over the weekend with his top advisers on the sampl issue 
and while he gave no clue to his intentions administration 
officials said an announcement could come early this week 
the senate armed services committee meanwhile is expected to 
vote by midweek on the nomination of former sen john g tower to be 
secretary of defense the vote will take place after the panel 
receives an fbi report on what congressional sources say are new 
allegations of drinking and womanizing by the texas republican 
the 51 percent pay raise for congress and executive branch 
political appointees could remain in effect for some time if the two 
houses are unable to resolve their differences 
wright emphasized last week that his 30 percent rollback wouldnt 
be an increase at all but a dollarfordollar tradeoff for house 
members who have been pocketing the honoraria maximum of 26850 
30 percent of salary a common cause study showed that 108 house 
members were at or near the limit in 1987 
while the 51 percent raise is law house members giving up the 
maximum honoraria would gain 18650 a year in the trade since 
senators have been allowed to retain 40 percent of their salary in 
honoraria 35800 those at the maximum would gain 9700 
annually from the full raise

chief justice william h rehnquist called monday 
for reform in a death penalty system that he said invites delays in 
executions that extend for years 
rehnquist in a speech prepared for the american bar association 
acknowledged that federal courts have overturned many state 
convictions in deathpenalty cases the naacp legal defense and 
educational fund says about 40 percent of state death penalty 
convictions and sentences are overturned by federal courts 
but to my mind the flaw in the present system is not that 
capital sentences are set aside by federal courts but that 
litigation ultimately resolved in favor of the states takes 
literally years and years and years rehnquist said 
the chief justice cited the most recent execution in the country 
that of serial killer ted bundy in florida on jan 24 as an example 
of a system of death penalty appeals that is often chaotic and 
drawn out unnecessarily 
rehnquist noted that the supreme court turned down three separate 
emergency pleas in bundys behalf hours before he was put to death 
all three of these actions were being prosecuted simultaneously 
on the day before the execution of a prisoner who had been on death 
row for nine years he said surely it would be a bold person to 
say that this system could not be improved 
rehnquist renewing an appeal he made about a year ago to a 
conference of state chief justices urged the aba to support reform 
of the death penalty appeal process 
retired supreme court justice lewis f powell was appointed by 
rehnquist to head a committee of federal judges looking into the 
question and the aba also has a panel studying the issue 
rehnquist said he is not calling for a drastic curtailing of the 
right of convicted killers to appeal to the federal courts for help 
a process known as federal habeas corpus 
rather the chief justice said he is seeking modest changes 
which will impose some structure on a system in which the average 
time elapsed between the commission of a crime and execution is 
eight years nationally and more than 13 years in some states there 
are more than 2000 prisoners on death row nationwide 
since 1976 when the supreme court allowed states to reinstate 
the death penalty there have been 106 executions nationwide 
more than 11000 federal court appeals were filed last year in 
death penalty cases 
rehnquist endorsed a requirement that all such appeals be 
consolidated in one petition and filed within a reasonable time 
after state court appeals have been exhausted he also said states 
could promote speedier resolution of death penalty cases by giving 
incentives for lawyers to represent those filing federal appeals 
on another subject rehnquist reiterated his endorsement of a 50 
percent increase in pay for federal judges that will take effect 
wednesday unless blocked before then by both houses of congress the 
judicial pay increase is part of a package that includes a similar 
hike for members of congress 
these increases simply restore to federal judges the purchasing 
power that has been eaten away by inflation over the past 20 
years rehnquist said they are essential if we are to continue 
to attract from the financially greener fields of private practice 
the sort of experienced and capable lawyers whom we want as judges 
rehnquist also proposed some changes aimed at reducing the 
workload for the federal courts 
for example he said someone from one state suing someone from 
another state should not have an automatic right to take the case to 
federal court on that basis

american workers increased their productivity 
by 14 percent last year the government reported monday an 
improvement over 1987 that nonetheless revived doubts about economic 
projections at the heart of president bushs spending plans 
the 14 percent gain in nonfarm business productivity was up 
from 08 percent in 1987 and matched the average 14 percent annual 
gain experienced since the end of the 198182 recession the labor 
department reported 
increased productivity getting each worker to produce more each 
hour he or she is on the job is vital to economic growth without 
inflation particularly given the current squeeze in the labor 
market 
total business productivity including farming fell at a 20 
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1988 because of a drop 
in farm productivity manufacturers reported a 32 percent increase 
in productivity last year down from 34 percent in 1987 the labor 
department said 
in his final budget former president reagan forecasted a 12 
percent productivity gain in 1989 a 18 percent rise in 1990 a 2 
percent jump in 1991 and 21 percent increases the next three years 
that forecast adopted by bush fiscal advisers calls for average 
annual productivity gains of 19 percent for 19891994 but analysts 
said there was nothing in the 1988 productivity report to suggest 
that type of improvement would occur particularly at a time of slow 
labor force growth 
meeting those targets would be essential to reaching the more 
than 3 percent average annual economic growth called for in the 
budget forecast without a significant increase in inflation indeed 
the budget blueprint assumes higher productivity and lower 
inflation something most analysts say is improbable 
nobody believes that forecast not even the guys who wrote 
it said michael evans president of evans economics of 
washington there really is no chance of productivity doubling in 
the next few years under any conceivable circumstances that i can 
see 
evans attributed the overall productivity gain in 1988 to the 
rapid economic expansion early in the year citing unchanged 
productivity in the fourth quarter and the smaller 07 percent 
change in the final quarter compared to the same period of 1987 
that is extremely sluggish growth in productivity said evans 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan last week also 
questioned the likelihood of 3 percent or higher annual economic 
growth and declining inflation as assumed in the budget forecast 
greenspan is expected to move to tighten the central banks reins on 
credit thereby slowing economic growth when its open market 
committee meets this week to set 1989 monetary targets 
if as expected the fed moves to slow economic growth to about 
25 percent a year productivity would be affected as well and gains 
in the next five years likely will average 14 percent as they have 
the past six years said economist roger brinner of data resources 
inc a lexington massbased forecasting firm 
what happens when the economy slows down is that you get a 
cyclical reduction in productivity brinner said thats a 
problem for the bush administration

a stripper who said she performed sex acts while 
television evangelist jimmy swaggart watched denied monday that she 
made up her story to cash in on publicity surrounding a similar 
story last year 
catherine mary kampen said she received anonymous offers of hush 
money to stop publication of the allegations which appeared last 
week in penthouse magazine and received threats before and after 
publication 
swaggart said last week there was no truth to the story and 
kampens employer called it a pornographic fairy tale invented 
for financial gain 
every word thats written in this magazine is true kampen 
declared monday at a news conference 
she and a magazine spokeswoman declined to say how much she 
received for her cooperation but kampen said it was such a small 
sum of money that it really is inconsequential 
swaggart last february confessed to an undisclosed sin involving 
a prostitute and was later defrocked by the assemblies of god 
ministry 
she said she offered to tell her story to reporter art harris for 
free and did not receive the money until long after she talked to 
him in the spring of 1988 
if i was going to make something up to cash in on something i 
surely wouldnt have made this up she said at a news conference 
at penthouse offices noting that the story does not exactly put 
me in a good light

soviet refuseniks jews who have been denied emigration

of zion a group uniting immigrants who have been in soviet prisons 
for zionist activity 
jonathan pollard understood the tragic history of our people 
and acted with desperate urgency to protect the people of israel 
the petition said his course of action though unwise was not 
intended to hurt his country but to prevent another tragedy for the 
remaining jewish people

emigrate and spent a decade in and out of jail stood near ida 
nudel known as the guardian angel of refuseniks before her 1987

firsttime homebuyers would be guaranteed a 
down payment by investing in state bonds under a program gov james 
blanchard said monday is designed to give everyone a crack at the 
american dream 
anything government can do to help the next generation realize 
their dreams is extremely important i think this program will not 
only work but sweep the country blanchard said of the home 
ownership savings trust program he plans to announce tuesday night 
in his state of the state address 
details of the program still are being worked out but blanchard 
said the goal of the program he hopes will begin this year is to 
help young families save the 5 percent or 10 percent down payment 
they need to buy a house 
prospective homeowners would give the state a lump sum or make 
monthly payments to buy taxfree bonds like an 800 million issue 
approved by voters in november for environmental cleanup and parks 
at the end of a contract that could range from three to 10 years 
the families would have enough for a down payment for a house in a 
price range they chose at the outset if prices go up faster than 
expected the state would make up the difference if they go up 
slower the state would keep the difference 
the approachh is similar to the michigan education trust in 
which parents pay a lump sum to guarantee their childs tuition at 
one of 15 universities or 29 community colleges officials estimate 
college tuition could ach 25000 in 18 years it cost about 6800 
to enroll a newborn in the trust last year more than 40000 
children were enrolled for a total investment of 265 million 
state department of treasury officials believe the program can be 
started without approval from the legislature 
the state is not spending money at all youre guaranteeing 
thats all blanchard said in this case youre also using 
taxfree bonds that we would have to pay for anyway 
usually taxfree bonds are sold in denominations of 5000 
10000 or 100000 in this program were going to sell them in 
small units so young couples can buy them and have the taxfree 
status of the interest earned 
the program will help reverse the trend of declining home 
ownership among young couples and a declining rate of savings he 
said it deals with a whole range of problems ive seen in our 
society weve got a whole new generation of people that may not 
have the same opportunities that we have

kitty dukakis the wife of gov michael s dukakis 
has entered an alcohol treatment program according to a statement 
issued by the governor today that blamed the problem on the letdown 
after his failed presidential campaign 
mrs dukakis 52 has had a history of addictions and chemical 
dependency but was never known to be dependent on alcohol until the 
statement was released this afternoon 
in july 1987 mrs dukakis announced that she had recovered from 
a 26year dependency on diet pills the governors wife said she had 
conquered her addiction to amphetamines which she hid from her 
husband after undergoing treatment at a minnesota facility in 1982 
dukakis said today that his wife entered the edgehill newport 
facility in newport ri sunday evening and will stay there for 
about 30 days 
until shortly after election day on nov 8 kitty had never had 
a problem with alcohol dukakis said 
unfortunately a combination of physical exhaustion the stress 
of the campaign effort and the postelection letdown all combined to 
create a situation in which on a limited number of occasions while 
at home she has used alcohol in excessive quantities the 
governor said 
dukakis press office did not answer questions about the 
statement but said the governor would hold a news conference later 
today 
dukakis who last month abruptly announced that he would not seek 
a fourth term as govenor said in his statement that mrs dukakis 
decided to enter the wellknown clinic voluntarily and said he and 
his family supported her decision 
we know how loved and respected she is both here in the 
commonwealth and across the nation and she is grateful for the 
love and support she has received from so many good and decent 
people dukakis said 
mrs dukakis who won high marks as a political campaigner during 
her husbands 1988 presidential effort has been prominent in the 
fight to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol 
abuse 
since the presidential defeat mrs dukakis has launched a new 
career as an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her 
husbands side on several occasions when she might have been 
expected 
on jan 3 for example when dukakis made the surprise 
announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor some 
observers remarked on the fact that mrs dukakis was not present 
last week the governor and first lady celebrated the birth of 
their first grandchild alexandra jane dukakis the daughter of 
john and lisa dukakis 
in july 1987 mrs dukakis with her husband at her side 
revealed that she had been drugfree for five years after seeking 
treatment at the hazelton center in centre city minn 
mrs dukakis said she began taking mild amphetamines in 1956 as a 
teenager to control her weight she continued the practice 
secretively for two decades and said her husband did not know of her 
dependency when they married in june 1963 
the governor first discovered her drug problem in 1974 mrs 
dukakis said they discussed the issue and that she stopped taking 
the pills for a while 
in 1982 dukakis discovered that his wife was again taking pills 
and the couple decided that mrs dukakis should seek the clinics 
help she entered the 30day minnesota program on july 14 1982 
in 1982 the public was told that mrs dukakis was suffering from 
hepatitis 
when she announced in 1987 the real reason for her disappearance 
from the public scene five years earlier she said after five 
years of being chemicalfree i feel strong and confident in myself 
and what ive done and secondly and as important or more 
important one of the tenets of recovering is helping other people 
its important for me to talk about this publicly to try to help 
other people who have the same kind of dependency 
edgehill newport was founded in 1980 and is described as the 
largest private alcohol treatment center in new england 
new patients are put through a detoxification center then 
transferred to other rooms for the balance of the 28day program it 
includes intensive counseling and emphasis on rest and proper diet

after 142 years the jonesville post 
office finally has outgrown tc lindseys general store 
the post office is among the nations oldest in an original site 
and has been used several times as a movie location because of its 
oldfashioned look but stardom doesnt turn the head of its 
postmaster who once refused to let a film crew take down the 
american flag flying over the building 
now its combinationlock boxes handsorter slots and original 
hand canceler will all soon be part of the past land for a new 
building has been selected about 500 feet to the north and the 
postal department is getting ready to take bids 
postmaster reba nolan says she hates to move out of the colorful 
general store that draws visitors from across the nation but she 
says a new building is an absolute necessity for this east texas 
town of about 400 
were bursting out the seams mrs nolan said last week 
im literally crawling over the mail to get out the door 
but mrs nolan who has been postmaster four years says she 
hopes the general stores owners will keep the post office intact as 
a wellpreserved page of american history 
mrs nolan still cancels jonesville mail with the post offices 
original hand canceler also intact is an oldfashioned service 
window with metal bars that has been featured in several movies 
the post office was once saved from closing by mrs nolans 
predecessor emma vaughan 
mrs vaughan whose husband owns the general store and still 
operates it said she took the job in 1949 after learning she was 
the only one in town with a civil service rating 
i had to take it because i was the only one that was 
qualified mrs vaughan said we knew that if it closed wed 
never get another one i agreed to keep it for six months but i 
stayed 38 years 
she initially made 1000 annually as the jonesville postmaster 
mrs vaughan said her salary had increased 25fold by the time she 
retired 
mrs vaughan said she hates to see progress force the post office 
out of her husbands store but said her family is part of the reason 
it has to move 
my son owns an oil company and his mail volume has really 
increased she said 
mrs nolan is only the fourth jonesville postmaster since world 
war i she had a runin several years ago with the people filming a 
remake of the long hot summer which starred don johnson cybill 
shepherd and jason robards 
she said she let the production crew pretty much have the run of 
the post office but drew a hard line when she saw them taking down 
the post offices american flag 
they explained the halyard was clanging against the flagpole in a 
brisk texas wind and was ruining the movies sound track they 
begged her to let them take it down but she was staunch in her 
refusal 
i told them they could just have someone shinny up the pole and 
hold it down if they wanted it quiet but it wasnt coming down 
she said

official and independent groups monday 
increased pressure on hungarian leaders to accept a communist party 
reformers appraisal of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising 
mti state news agency carried statements giving unqualified 
backing to politburo member imre pozsgay he stunned hungarians nine 
days ago when he said in a radio interview the 1956 revolt crushed 
by soviet tanks was a popular uprising 
for three decades the revolt officially has been branded a 
counterrevolution instigated from abroad to destroy communism 
pozsgays statement touched off differences with other party leaders 
mti released statements of the official hungarian writers union 
and revived smallholders party as well as of an alliance of 15 
independent political groups including the union of young democrats 
and hungarian democratic forum 
they appear designed to bolster pozsgay after the reformer was 
rebuked by party chief karoly grosz other senior officials and the 
ferenc muennich society a club of conservative communists opposing 
hungarys fastmoving reform movement 
apparently reacting to his critics in the party pozsgay toned 
down his statement saturday telling a workers meeting popular 
uprising is not a final formula or a verdict but one recommended 
in the spirit of reconciliation with the people 
pozsgay has to answer for his stand at a special central 
committee meeting friday 
the smallholders said they consider october 1956 as a national 
uprising and a revolution against stalinism and find pozsgays 
reappraisal a compromise acceptable for society 
the other independent groups said political cooperation with the 
communists is conceivable only if there is a just historical 
appraisal and a revised outlook on the popular uprising unleashed in 
1956 against the stalinist party state 
over the weekend the daughter of revolt leader imre nagy and 
widows of two nagy colleagues executed for their part in the 1956 
uprising appeared on television for the first time in 32 years 
they called for a public reburial of their relatives 
nagy was executed by the soviets whom the hungarian leadership 
invited to crush the revolt 
the official hungarian roman catholic weekly uj ember meanwhile 
reported that the 1948 trial and life sentencing of the late 
cardinal jozsef mindszenty was rigged 
uj ember said published documents show his trial was carried 
out according to a preplanned and prepared concept 
the former primate of the hungarian catholic church was arrested 
in 1948 as an enemy of communism and following a humiliating trial 
was sentenced to life imprisonment under false charges of high 
treason 
in 1956 the cardinal was freed from prison by hungarian 
revolutionaries after the uprising he found permanent shelter in 
the us legation in budapest 
in 1971 under an agreement between the vatican and the hungarian 
government mindszenty left his asylum at the american mission and 
after a short stay in rome settled in vienna where he died in may 
1975 at age 83

outdated state laws aimed at preventing child 
abuse have allowed some organizations to act as illegal police 
forces glorified gun clubs and fronts for drug rings the state 
attorney general said monday 
legislators should repeal the 1875 law that authorizes creation 
of societies for the prevention of cruelty to children attorney 
general robert abrams said in his report on a yearlong 
investigation 
many of them have become parapolice organizations with no 
legitimate purpose having to do with children at all abrams said 
some groups have cars and uniforms patrolling the streets and 
arresting people for traffic violations according to the report 
members deceive people into thinking theyre police officers and 
have caches of firearms federal drug agents taped a conversation of 
a sullivan county member bragging that he uses spcc credentials to 
make drug dealing easier the attorney general said 
the 1875 law was passed at a time when government agencies played 
no role in child protection lawmakers gave spcc officers peace 
officer status meaning they can carry handguns and make arrests 
and gave them the right to enforce all laws relating to or 
affecting children said abrams report 
new york has 24 licensed spccs seven all formed before 1920 
act as social service agencies and dont use peace officer powers 
the remainder all but one formed after 1972 either have a 
distinct law enforcement orientation or do nothing at all 
abrams said five of these have dissolved and five are in the 
process there are only three such societies outside new york 
abrams said groups in nassau county and brooklyn have 
applications pending for new spccs but hes opposing them in 
court he is calling for the deletion of spcc agents from the list 
of peace officers and is proposing that the state department of 
social services be given the authority to supervise all spccs 
among the problems detailed in the report were 
a westchester county society that searched a 16yearold boy at 
gunpoint and bound him to a chair overnight abrams obtained an 
injunction barring that group from detaining suspects anywhere but 
in jails 
a suffolk county society was investigating the illegal sale of 
alcohol to minors in bars 
long island society members pulled cars over on new york city 
highways in one case drawing guns and telling the person they were 
police 
a sullivan county society member said in a taperecorded 
conversation that his status gave him access to weapons and less 
scrutiny when stopped by police he was arrested on charges of 
selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent 
investigators found no evidence that any organizations obstructed 
child abuse investigations if someone with a legitimate abuse 
complaint calls one of the societies theyre generally told to 
contact a social service agency 
kenneth ellman head of the westchester county spcc criticized 
abrams and said the state needed more spcc services not less these 
organizations give people an option when other state agencies have 
failed he said

millions of barefoot hindus from across 
india jostled and pushed their way to take a dip at the confluence 
of two sacred rivers monday in hopes it would bring them eternal 
salvation 
an estimated 15 million people bathed at river banks in this 
central indian city during the day many starting as early as 4 
am authorities said 
hindus believe that lord brahma the creator of the earth and one 
of the ruling trinity of a pantheon of gods and goddesses awakes at 
that hour 
the bathing is the high point of the sevenweek kumbh mela 
festival which according to the guinness book of world records is 
the largest religious gathering on earth 
the grand show was a grand success said ravindra gupta the 
chief administrator of allahabad it was a difficult day for us 
but its over 
his relief came from the fact that the fair a logistical 
nightmare at the best of times had ended without any major 
problems 
stampedes and armed confrontations between different hindu sects 
have claimed hundreds of lives in previous fairs in 1954 at least 
800 people died in a stampede 
police said four people died monday two were drowned when their 
boat capsized in midstream and two others died of natural causes 
said superintendent vibhuti narain rai 
authorities make arrangements for the supply of 13000 gallons of 
milk 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of cheese to the pilgrims every 
day allahabad city officials have also stockpiled 10000 tons of 
wheat 4000 tons of rice and 2000 tons of sugar 
the kumbh mela is celebrated every 12 years when a rare planetary 
configuration occurs jupiter in taurus the sun and moon in 
capricorn and a series of complicated calculations of hindu 
astrology 
monday is considered the climax of the festival which started 
jan 14 because it is also the day of the new moon another good 
omen 
the festival takes its name of kumbh mela from hindu mythology 
when the gods seized a pot of nectar that made them invincible in 
their war against the demons 
a drop of nectar from the gods pot is thought to have fallen at 
allahabad where the ganges and jamuna rivers come together a bath 
at the spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring salvation 
from the cycle of birth and rebirth 
the pilgrims were a diverse lot holy men from himalayan cave 
homes and naked recluses from forest dens came to the river banks in 
chariots and on camels draped with brightly embroidered cloths 
most trekked to the bathing spots but some came on horseback and 
the more affluent in mercedes salons 
the bathing at the kumbh mela began with processions of holy men 
their order determined from days of yore according to the importance 
of their sects dipping at the confluence of the ganges the yamuna 
and the mythical swaraswati the swaraswati cannot be seen but 
hindus believe it flows beneath the earths surface where the two 
other rivers meet 
the rivers turned muddy brown and foul smelling as more bathers 
immersed themselves many used empty liquor bottles and pots to 
carry the holy water home 
either these people are crazy or there must be something we 
cant see or understand said nina marshall 23 of berkeley 
calif 
it is vibrating she said pointing to the barefoot pilgrims 
walking to the junction of the ganges and jamuna rivers she was 
among dozens of americans who had come to see the unique religious 
spectacle 
for the faithful the bathing is a onceinalifetime opportunity 
i planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop 
said sarju mahato a farmer from bihar state as he tended the 
blisters on his two sons feet we saved money and came here 
ganesh dasgupta a railroad worker from calcutta brought his 
family of six and said with satisfaction i have got what i 
wanted a bath here is equal to visiting all the pilgrim centers in 
the country

iran will use diplomacy to export its islamic 
revolution foreign minister ali akbar velayati said monday but he 
appeared unwilling to use that persuasion on tehrans biggest foes 
washington and iraq 
iran will hold direct peace talks with iraq soon but they 
will make no progress unless iraqi troops withdraw from iranian 
territory velayati told a news conference 
he also said better relations with the united states are possible 
only if washington changes its hostile posture toward irans 
revolution 
we have a concept and we are going to continue the policy to 
export the revolution said velayati but this doesnt mean 
were going to export the revolution with a gun 
youre trying to make other people in the world to be 
westernoriented he told scores of foreign reporters in tehran 
for 10th anniversary celebrations of the revolution were going 
to do the same on the basis of our islamic beliefs and concepts 
he said 
iran has been restoring relations with western countries and its 
gulf neighbors in a new opendoor policy aimed at ending a decade of 
selfimposed isolation 
except for the palestineoccupying regime israel and the 
racist south african regime and precluding american sabotage we 
desire good relations with other countries of the world velayati 
said 
the tehran hierarchy is deeply divided over restoring links with 
the united states severed in 1979 
tehrans socalled pragmatists have united however to make it 
clear iran has backed off the militant export of its fundamentalist 
revolution since the aug 20 unsponsored ceasefire in irans 
eightyear war with iraq 
velayati said peace talks with iraq were effectively deadlocked 
and baghdad was making no effort to get them going again 
if iraq adopts a stubborn attitude and refuses to retreat the 
talks will get nowhere he said 
he gave no date for resuming the talks deadlocked since last 
november over the issue of troop withdrawals 
both velayati and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz are due in 
new york this week for talks with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar that could bring the two facetoface 
meanwhile aziz sent a letter to perez de cuellar saying iraq 
rejects any iranian preconditions for resuming talks the official 
iraqi news agency reported monday 
ina reported the letter said iraq is ready to cooperate with the 
secretarygeneral in a constructive manner to break the 
deadlock aziz accused iran of neglecting its obligations under the 
un ceasefire resolution by insisting on a troop withdrawal 
iran claims iraq still holds 390 square miles of its territory 
iraq refuses to withdraw without a guarantee of freedom of 
navigation in the gulf 
airlines that suspended their flights because of the war have 
begun to fly back to iran and iraq 
alitalia the italian airline announced monday it is resuming 
separate weekly flights to tehran and baghdad this week 
tehran has been spruced up for the revolutions anniversary 
buildings are draped in flags and sparkle at night with cascades of 
colored lights in sharp contrast to celebrations during the war 
when blackouts were in effect to combat iraqi missile strikes

the author of a landmark law limiting trade 
with the soviet union is proposing a relaxation of the curbs in 
light of the kremlins agreement to allow more jewish emigration 
according to a letter released monday 
the letter by charles vanik a former congressman from ohio who 
cosponsored the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment reflects a fledgling 
movement among legislators and jewish groups for a reassessment of 
restrictions on trade with the soviets 
the jan 30 letter from vanik now in private law practice was 
written to edgar bronfman president of the world jewish congress a 
copy was obtained from the organization 
the group is one of several prominent jewish organizations 
advocating a reexamination of the 1974 amendment that imposes high 
tariffs on imports from any communist country denying its citizens 
the right to emigrate 
the amendment which had been originated by the late senator 
henry jackson was designed to stop soviet restrictions on jews 
seeking to emigrate and has served as leverage in the hands of 
successive administrations in their dealings with moscow 
the amendment allows the president to recommend to congress a 
waiver of the restrictions for at least 18 months if the soviets or 
other communist countries stop their emigration restrictions over 
the years poland hungary and romania have benefited from such 
waivers 
critics of the amendment argue that whatever improvements have 
occurred since then in soviet emigration policy have been the result 
of internal reforms in the soviet union or developments in 
superpower arms control negotiations rather than the jacksonvanik 
law 
i disagree vanik said in an interview i think the 
amendment has done many people a great deal of good 
seeking to take advantage of the economic openness to outsiders 
instituted by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev us business 
leaders have in recent months launched a campaign to form joint 
ventures that would give them a foothold in the largely untapped 
soviet market 
vanik and other experts agree that a waiver of the jacksonvanik 
bill would not result in much immediate trade but would improve 
overall relations and the climate for doing business its a way 
of sending them a signal saying were encouraged by what youre 
doing keep it up vanik said 
but the push for a waiver which is written into the amendment 
would have to come from the jewish community which has been the 
main proponent and beneficiary of the bill vanik said 
the world jewish congress projects that at the current level of 
emigration some 38000 jews will be allowed to leave the soviet 
union this year this compares with the record 51320 allowed out in 
1979 and a record low of some 900 in 1986 
rep stephen solarz dny who has a large jewish constituency 
said in a recent speech that it was only a matter of time until 
the waiver is enacted if the emigration levels maintain their 
current pace 
organization officials say they will formally consider their 
position regarding a waiver of the jacksonvanik law at a may 7 
meeting in montreal canada but they indicate that if the soviets 
allow direct flights of emigrants from moscow to israel that 
would create the environment for immediate jewish support of a 
jacksonvanik waiver said executive director elan steinberg 
the soviets who broke off relations with israel in 1967 have 
refused to allow direct flights sending the jewish emigres to rome 
or vienna israel has complained that this practice allows jews to 
proceed from europe to the united states canada and other points 
rather than going to the jewish state 
the new administration has yet to take a stand on the subject 
state department spokesman charles redman reiterated the view of the 
reagan administration that this is the kind of thing were it to 
happen would require a very strong consensus among the 
administration congress and the american people

the government on monday 
cracked down for the first time on the countrys most powerful white 
extremist group banning the display of firearms at meetings of the 
afrikaner resistance movement 
law and order minister adriaan vlok imposed the ban on the 
neonazi group under the same emergency regulations used to restrict 
many antiapartheid movements 
meetings of the resistance movement known by its afrikaans 
initials as the awb were characterized by emotionladen speeches 
in which remarks about the use of violence were uttered vlok 
said 
often statements are made at such gatherings which disrupt the 
relationship between the different races and kindle a climate of 
animosity and polarization he said 
the movement was founded in 1973 and does not disclose its 
membership but regularly draws thousands of whites to its rallies 
many members wear swastikalike emblems on their khaki uniforms and 
the groups leader eugene terreblanche often ends fiery speeches 
with a hitlerstyle salute 
at a leadership meeting jan 21 in pretoria where terreblanche 
loyalists repudiated a challenge to his leadership the chief 
instructor of the the groups paramilitary unit was on guard outside 
the auditorium with an automatic rifle slung over his shoulder 
vloks statement said dissension within the movement has 
increased the possibility of violence 
the minister also said the government was considering broader 
steps including a ban on possession of weapons at all political and 
cultural gatherings at present many whites and a handful of blacks 
have permits which allow them to carry weapons virtually anywhere 
the challenge to terreblanches leadership began in december 
after he was accused of having an extramarital relationship with 
jani allan a former model who writes a column for the nationally 
circulated sunday times 
terreblanche who is married has denied any improper 
relationship with ms allan 
four senior members of the movement demanded his resignation and 
one of them accused terreblanche of womanizing and excessive 
drinking charges terreblanche denied 
the government recently has been criticized for failing to take 
tough action against extremeright whites involved in a series of 
racist incidents across the country 
last year the government banned a small whitesupremacist group 
called the white liberation movement and was accused of lacking the 
courage to act against the more powerful movement 
the group contends the governments limited political reforms 
will lead to a takeover by the disenfranchised black majority

talks that began monday between solidarity 
and the government likely will produce results some experts say 
because the oncebitter enemies now have no choice but to agree 
for the first time since the communist party consolidated power 
after world war ii a crosssection of the opposition has begun to 
negotiate openly with authorities over how poland should be 
governed how its political system should be reformed and how its 
economy should be managed 
i am proud that such an unprecedented event in socialist 
countries is taking place in poland said wanda paluszewska an 
engineer standing outside the palace where the talks are being held 
this may be really the last chance which may save poland from 
bloodshed 
the opposition is represented by solidarity chief lech walesa 
scholars writers and intellectuals the prosolidarity delegation 
numbers 25 
there are 57 seats at the round table built specially for the 
talks and the rest are filled by representatives of the ruling 
communist party two communistallied groups government officials 
members of the official opzz trade union alliance intellectuals 
linked to the party and three roman catholic church officials 
gen czeslaw kiszczak who as interior minister is polands top 
police officer is the host 
i am an optimist by nature i believe that the debates will 
be successful he said before the talks began 
although authorities vowed after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
that solidarity would never be allowed to operate legally again the 
talks are aimed at achieving just that 
officials faced with a deteriorating economy and tired of the 
political stalemate with solidarity decided in bitter debate at a 
party meeting last month to make peace with the opposition 
they said they hoped the decision would win them public support 
as they seek further economic sacrifices from a weary populace they 
also anticipate a larger measure of sympathy from potential lenders 
in the west 
poland desperately needs money for investments but western loans 
even for small commercial transactions virtually ceased after the 
martiallaw decree 
as the price for legalizing solidarity authorities want the 
opposition to back economic reforms and to participate in the 
communistdominated government and parliament 
it is this demand that causes the greatest uneasiness among 
solidarity veterans walesa has vowed not to accept any compromise 
that would inhibit the unions independence 
i think it is of historic significance michael mandelbaum 
an expert on eastwest relations with the council on foreign 
relations said of the talks during an interview in new york last 
week 
noting that the cold war began when the communists seized power 
in poland after world war ii he said cooperation between the polish 
government and the opposition could help ease eastwest tensions 
economic pressures make the move toward national agreement a 
necessity mandelbaum said 
if things go on poland would be a third world country this 
awareness has forced political changes he said 
charles gati an eastern european expert and professor at union 
college in new york said polish authorities seem ready to reverse 
themselves and come to terms with polish political realities and it 
is wonderful news 
poland cannot be governed without solidarity he said it 
can be ruled with some difficulty without solidarity 
but gati added polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski has 
learned that ruling by itself is simply not enough 
he cited several factors leading to the governments decision to 
sit down with solidarity strong support in society for solidarity 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs commitment to reform the 
continued decline of the economy and the appointment of a new prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski in a government shakeup last fall 
gati said rakowski is as shrewd at they come and recognizes 
the logic of talking with solidarity

angry relatives of flight 103 victims accused the 
federal government and pan american world airways on monday of 
negligence before the bombing that killed 270 people and of 
insensitivity afterward 
thirty relatives some with photographs of their lost loved ones 
pinned to their clothes chiefly demanded an accounting of why the 
government had not made public a terrorist threat that such a flight 
would be bombed 
the group also demanded the resignation of alan mcartor chief of 
the federal aviation administration saying he had failed to 
maintain security and asked that congress investigate the 
circumstances of the pan am attack 
but in an outpouring of emotion and frustration the relatives 
voiced a litany of other complaints ranging from their inability to 
recover their loved ones personal effects to the handling of the 
victims remains 
colleen hermann of huntington ny described how her family 
watched as 10 caskets one containing her brothers body were 
unloaded by forklift from a plane in a livestock cargo area at john 
f kennedy international airport 
there was no representative of pan am there no one even spoke 
english she said tearfully at a news conference and that is 
how my brother came home 
the relatives in a statement complained of utter silence by 
high government officials no condolence no attendance at memorial 
services no answers to letters they suggested officials were 
seeking to conceal mishandling of the threat that preceded the 
bombing 
i am outraged that the most democratic country in the world so 
they claim keeps information from people to choose when to die 
said marina de larracoechea whose sister was killed on the flight 
a life for an airline ticket is an extremely high price to pay 
the government told airlines and embassies of a threat that 
terrorists would bomb a us flight from frankfurt in december but 
it did not warn the public officials said they get such unconfirmed 
threats on a daily basis and would cripple the airline industry by 
announcing them publicly 
the relatives called that policy immoral and possibly 
criminal while the faa receives perhaps 500 threats annually 
fewer than 25 are considered highlevel threats as the 
frankfurt threat apparently was they said 
the relatives angrily suggested that the government had widely 
advised federal employees not to take flights such as pan am 103 
noting that it had more than 150 empty seats at the height of the 
busy christmas season 
the new yorkbound flight which originated in frankfurt and 
changed to a larger plane in london exploded over lockerbie 
scotland on dec 21 all 259 aboard died as did 11 on the ground 
pamela hanlon a pan am spokeswoman noted that the threat had 
not identified a specific flight and that pan am had increased its 
security after receiving the warning she said the number of vacant 
seats wasnt unusual 
ms hanlon said pan am had assigned each family an individual 
company official to serve as its liaison she said she had not known 
of the specific complaint by ms hermann on the handling of her 
brothers remains 
an faa spokesman did not return two telephone messages at the 
state department spokeswoman francis jones said she wanted to see 
the relatives statement before commenting

president robert mugabe on monday called 
for tougher economic sanctions on south africa and urged the united 
nations to increase the strength of its peacekeeping force for 
namibia 
the zimbabwean leader told foreign ministers from the 
eightnation commonwealth committee on south africa that the 
international campaign for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions 
aimed at ending pretorias legal system of racial separation must be 
intensified 
friends allies and sympathizers of pretoria must be told 
clearly that the commonwealth will not allow this call to be 
suppressed by anyone until south africa is ready to dismantle her 
evil system said mugabe who also is current chairman of the 
101nation nonaligned movement 
he was opening a threeday meeting of the commonwealth committee 
seeking ways to increase external pressure on south africas 
government and bolster blackgoverned neighbors threatened by south 
african destabilization 
several of south africas neighbors are members of the 48member 
commonwealth a loose association of britain and its former 
colonies britain is not a member of the committee because prime 
minister margaret thatcher opposes sanctions 
mugabe applauded the usbrokered peace plan plotting 
independence for namibia also known as southwest africa after 
unsponsored elections in november 
but he said african nations remain deeply suspicious of south 
africas part in the agreement which angola and cuba also signed 
and fear attempts to weaken the un role in the territory pretoria 
has administered since world war 1 
south africa must never be allowed to manipulate the election 
processes directly or indirectly in her favor all loopholes must 
therefore be closed to her he said 
any optimism this agreement may have generated must be tempered 
by anxiety about potential hurdles and land mines mugabe said 
the zimbabwean is an outspoken critic of suggestions favored by 
the five permanent members of the un security council to reduce 
the namibia peacekeeping force from 7500 to 4650 men to save costs 
britain china france the soviet union and the united states 
pay 58 percent of all peacekeeping costs 
commonwealth secretarygeneral shridath ramphal told the session 
that reducing the force will save the five about 160 million 
this was the cost of about seven fighter aircraft or two hours of 
the collective military spending of the five major powers ramphal 
said 
he described the proposed cuts as an emasculation of the uns 
role in nambia 
joe clark canadas external affairs minister and chairman of the 
commonwealth group said the meeting will review ways to strengthen 
the international arms embargo against pretoria measures against 
south africa in world money markets and the effects of sanctions on 
african nations dependent on south africa for trade and transport 
links 
other members of the committee are australia guyana india 
nigeria tanzania and zambia

the national association of housing and 
redevelopment officials urged president bush on monday to support a 
tax increase as a way to correct what it said is a crisis in housing 
it is now time to recognize the severity of the fiscal deficit 
and its pervasive impact on all aspects of the quality of life in 
our communities said helen l sause of san francisco president 
of the association 
the only way to address it is to increase revenues she said 
at a news conference unless this action is taken no one will 
seriously address the need to adequately fund domestic programs 
the association which is holding its annual winter meeting in 
washington represents more than 2700 local housing and community 
development agencies across the country 
she cited a 70 percent reduction in federal funding for housing 
since 1980 the loss of the 4 billion general revenue sharing 
program to local governments and the loss of tax incentives for 
building lowincome housing as a result of the 1986 tax law changes 
as devastating the supply of housing 
she said the increasing numbers of homeless families and 
households living in substandard housing are evidence of a crisis in 
housing 
in calling for higher taxes the association declined to suggest 
a specific proposal for raising taxes or to say how much money 
should be raised through higher taxes

israel formally asked the united states on 
monday to stop its dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization in view of an attempt by palestinian guerrillas to 
infiltrate the northern israeli border sources said 
the request was submitted by an israeli diplomat to the state 
departments bureau of near east affairs which handles the middle 
east said the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
in israel defense minister moshe arens accused the plo of 
violating its december pledge to renounce all acts of terrorism 
in a speech to the conference of presidents of major american 
jewish organizations arens cited a clash saturday in which israeli 
troops killed five palestinians on the northern border of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in south lebanon 
the radical plo factions of george habashs marxist popular front 
for the liberation of palestine and the syrianbacked palestinian 
liberation front took responsibility for trying to attack israeli 
positions 
last december the united states overturned a 13year ban on 
talks with the plo after the organizations chief yasser arafat 
promised to stop all acts of terrorism and declared that his 
organization recognizes israel 
the us ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau met with plo 
officials dec 14 and twice more since then the state department 
said 
department spokesman charles redman said were looking into 
whether saturdays attack violates arafats nonviolence pledge 
other officials said the united states was seeking additional 
information about the clash 
the complaint came as israels military chief of staff lt gen 
dan shomron began a visit to washington as the guest of the defense 
department shomron has been quoted as telling the israeli 
government in closeddoor session that the plo has kept its promise 
and refrained from attacking israelis in south lebanon or along the 
border 
but other officials contend that while arafats mainstream fatah 
group may be adhering to the nonviolence pledge other more 
militant factions within the plo are escaping arafats control 
shomron is scheduled to meet with pentagon officials and to tour 
army navy and air force installations

lack of unity in miamis black leadership must be 
overcome before real progress can be made in the overtown and 
liberty city neighborhoods that erupted into violence last month 
community leaders say 
black leadership in miami is a myth said garth reeves 69 
publisher of the miami times a newspaper that serves the black 
community we dont have any organized leadership a lot of people 
have their own agendas but its fractured 
as a result he said were powerless 
john due director of metrodades community relations board 
said he doesnt know what people are talking about when they refer 
to the black community 
i call it the noncommunity he said 
but unlike reeves due said he thinks he knows why there is a 
leadership vacuum were all migrants he said were all from 
somewhere else we have no shared childhoods to develop trust and 
loyalty and extended families 
he noted that after the 1980 and 1982 riots white leaders called 
in prominent national black leaders such as andrew young and jesse 
jackson to help deal with the situation 
but he said blacks must now organize at all levels 
weve got to have the street leaders there too he said 
you know the king of the pool hall 
the fractured nature of miamis black leadership was evident a 
week after the riots when rep john conyers dmich came to 
overtown to hear from local residents ray fauntroy president of 
the miami chapter of the southern christian leadership conference 
the sponsor of the event wanted to bar the media from the meeting 
but city commissioner miller dawkins and some other black leaders 
were opposed and threatened to walk out if the media ban were 
enacted after some heated discussion then reporters and cameras 
were allowed to stay 
just an hour earlier a new black organization people united for 
justice held its own event a rally for justice at the 
metrodade justice building only about a dozen participants showed 
up but organizer billy hardeman shrugged it off 
thats not important he said its the message not the 
numbers that are important eventually the numbers will come 
bill perry president of the overtown advisory board a 
longstanding committee of overtown leaders agreed that black 
leadership is unfocused and said it amounts to a real problem 
yet he said he resents the new faces that have emerged since the 
recent riots its annoying there are a lot of egos and prima 
donnas perry said 
the rev willie sims pastor of the new mount zion baptist church 
in liberty city said he welcomes new blood as long as it is not 
from out of town 
sims was especially critical of the visit by a controversial new 
york city black activist the rev al sharpton during the week of 
the riots we dont need any publicity seekers he said 
sims suggested that miamis black leadership problem may stem 
from the fact that the citys black communities are so spread out 
geographically 
it would be impossible for any one individual to lay claim to 
the entire black community he said 
but not all prominent miami blacks will admit that there is a 
leadership problem 
weve got black leaders who are doing it every day miller 
dawkins dade county commissioner barbara carey the urban 
league said t willard fair president of the urban league of 
greater miami we were all here before the riots and well all be 
here after the riots well ignore the johnnycomelatelys

conservation planning to protect highly 
erodible land from erosion has edged close to the twothirds mark 
give or take a few percentage points the agriculture department 
said monday 
as of jan 1 according to the departments soil conservation 
service plans were completed for 892 million acres or slightly 
less than 63 percent of the estimated 1417 million acres 
scs chief wilson scaling said in his agencys statement however 
we met our goal of having conservation plans on 65 percent of 
highly erodible land by jan 1

acres were an estimate that is expected to be adjusted to about 136 
million acres at some point 
thus said spokeswoman leslie wilder the goal for having 65 
percent of the plans done by jan 1 had been met 
to remain eligible for usda programs including crop price 
supports and other benefits farmers who operate highly erodible 
cropland must have a conservation plan approved by dec 31 1989 
as of jan 1 conservation plans have been implemented on 252 
million acres or 18 percent of the land

people gazed through iron fences at a 
former palace on monday some with rosaries in their hands hoping 
for signs that the government and opposition leaders inside were 
reaching agreement on the nations future 
people are standing around with tears in their eyes because 
they know the fate of poland is being decided a middleaged woman 
said we are all experiencing it we are praying 
hundreds were outside when the 57 delegates of the government 
roman catholic church and political opposition arrived at midday for 
negotiations that could bring political and economic reforms and 
restore legal status to the independent trade union solidarity 
a few people lingered in the darkening chill of late afternoon 
staring at the glow of light from the twostory meeting hall in the

a fruit farmer has offered to take in a 
retarded man who has spent 32 years in a state mental hospital after 
being mistakenly ruled insane a judge said monday 
the judge had planned to announce the fate of the man bernt 
murphy 51 at a hearing monday but put off his decision to 
consider the new offer the utah supreme court ordered murphy freed 
ruling he was wrongly judged insane in 1957 after first confessing 
to a murder and then recanting 
a committee appointed by third district judge pat b brian 
already had made recommendations on murphys future brian said he 
wants the committe to study the new offer and he will decide feb 
22 where murphy should live 
the farmer reid wayman 61 a retired school teacher said he 
has employed five mentally retarded men over the past 24 years one 
of which remains at the farm living in a mobile home 
i was looking around for someone to keep this boy company 
wayman said referring to the handicapped man who lives and works on 
his farm he said he did not consider murphy dangerous 
i gather from what ive read and what ive been told that its 
past history the incident was one that was not intentional he 
said 
the utah supreme court ruled last june that murphy should be 
freed from the utah state hospital in provo where he was sent 
following the 1957 rape and beating of a 5yearold girl 
during questioning about that crime murphy then 19 admitted to 
the 1955 murder of a 23yearold mentally retarded woman he had 
known at the utah state training school for the mentally retarded in 
american fork 
murphy later denied killing the woman he was found incompetent 
to stand trial and the murder was never solved 
his attorney brooke wells has said murphy has the mental 
capacity of an 8yearold and should fare well in a group home with 
other retarded adults but state officials have said murphy still is 
capable of violent behavior 
he has not been a model client said john lesnan program 
specialist in the state division of mental health it has been an 
ongoing series of events not sporadic that have convinced us he 
could be dangerous 
his episodes have ranged from minor like making threats to 
very serious like physical aggression that requires several people 
to restrain him lesnan said 
when questioned after the hearing monday about whether he wanted 
to leave the provo institution murphy replied yes i do real 
bad ive got friends inside and outside 
right now im starting to hate it more worser he said 
adding he would be happy living on a ranch because he grew up 
ranching and farming 
george brinkerhoff murphys treatment coordinator at the mental 
hospital said that if conditions were right at waymans ranch 
perhaps that would be the best choice 
social services officials have said there are three other 
choices they include placing murphy in a house or apartment under 
24hour supervision a small group home with other retarded adults 
and a semiindependent apartment setting with staff members housed 
on either side of those living quarters

however the balance would be paid from onbudget outlays of 
general revenues 
hopefully some of these revenues will be recovered in the future 
through sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers 
fourth we plan to increase the budget of the justice department 
by approximately 50 million to enable it to create a nationwide 
program to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoing 
in the management of these failed institutions 
these funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devoted 
to the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraud 
in our financial markets 
as you can see these proposals are based upon several overriding 
principles 
first i will not support any new fee on depositors 
second we should preserve the overall federal budget structure 
and not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loan 
executives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantly 
alter our overall budget priorities 
and third i have concluded that this proposal if promptly 
enacted will enable our system to prevent any repetition of this 
situation 
and fourth ive decided to attack this problem headon with 
every available resource of our government because it is a national 
problem 
ive directed that the combined resources of our federal agencies 
be brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem 
and fifth i believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real 
cost of providing the deposit insurance protection 
the price the fdic charges banks for their insurance has not been 
increased since 1935 
we propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7 
cents per 100 of insurance protection that they receive 
every penny collected would be used to strengthen the fdic so 
that the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few years 
from now 
and i make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to 
recover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behind 
bars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior 
let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at 
risk the savings of american families anticipate that we will seek 
them out pursue them and demand the most severe penalty 
in closing i want to just say a word to the small savers of 
america 
across this great land families and individuals work and save 
and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote a 
brighter future for our children 
your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits 
before 
it does today and it will do so at all times in the future 
every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and credit 
of the united states of america which means it will be that it 
will be absolutely protected 
for the future we will seek to achieve a safe sound and 
profitable banking system 
however integrity and prudence must share an equal position with 
competition in our financial markets 
clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy and 
to the public confidence that is its most important ingredient 
ive determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for your 
support in putting it behind us 
i have ordered that the resources of the executive branch be 
brought to bear on cleaning up this problem 
i have personally met with the leadership of congress on this 
issue 
my administration will work cooperatively with congress as the 
legislation that we will submit in a few days time is considered 
i call on the congress to join me in a determined effort to 
resolve this threat to the american financial system permanently 
and to do so without delay

gen andres rodriguez who seized power 
in a violent coup last week denied links with the drug traffic and 
announced monday that elections will be held may 1 with only 
communists excluded 
four cronies of ousted president alfredo stroessner who ruled 
paraguay for nearly 35 years until the coup were accused of using 
public funds and graft to obtain luxurious mansions expensive 
apartments abroad and sumptuous automobiles 
reporters asked the general about casualties during eight hours 
of fighting thursday night and early friday that ousted stroessner 
believe me total casualties dead plus wounded do not 
exceed 50 rodriguez replied earlier estimates by embassies and 
civilian witnesses put the number of dead alone at nearly 300 but 
no official figures have been released 
rodriguez also said congress has been dissolved and that the new 
president would take office immediately upon election some 
opposition leaders said they didnt have enough time to prepare for 
the election 
stroessner was given asylum in neighboring brazil and was staying 
in itumbiara a remote city 270 miles southeast of brasilia he is 
living in a house owned by the government power company which 
operates a dam on the nearby paranaiba river 
at the first presidential news conference paraguayans could 
remember rodriguez said rumors of his involvement with the drug 
trade were spread by people trying to defame me 
i detest drugs he told reporters let into his office in 
small groups i swear as a catholic and as a family man i swear 
on my children i have no connections with drugs 
paraguay has become a way station for cocaine produced in 
neighboring bolivia foreign diplomats academics and media reports 
have linked rodriguez with traffickers but no proof has been 
presented and no charges have been filed 
asked whether he would cooperate with the us drug enforcement 
administration he said paraguay will cooperate with all foreign 
governments and agencies including the united states and the more 
help we get the better we will fight together 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
us relations with paraguay will depend on the actions of the 
government on creating democracy respecting human rights and 
suppressing narcotics trafficking and cultivation we will be 
watching closely the extent to which the provisional government 
allows opposition parties to campaign and the media to broadcast the 
positions of the candidates and their parties he said 
rodriguez a 65yearold cavalry general said stroessner was 
not a dictator 
if the colorado party elected him for so many years it must 
have been because of confidence in him he said after seizing 
power in 1954 stroessner held elections every five years and won by 
landslides 
stroessners legal situation is being studied by the court 
system rodriguez added he could come back in two or three 
years he has gone for a rest in brazil 
asked what prompted the coup rodriguez said in recent times 
he was not producing good results for his party which had trusted 
him 
rodriguez did not explain the remark but he appeared to be 
speaking of an internal struggle between stroessner supporters and 
traditionalists who wanted to draw a distinction between the 
101yearold party and the dictator 
rodriguez also said several stroessner henchmen are under 
arrest and their cases will be brought before civil or military 
courts 
a lawyer pedro abilio rolon filed a citizens suit in supreme 
court on monday against the former ministers of the interior 
justice and public health and stroessners private secretary mario 
abdo benitez 
he accused them of misusing public funds and accepting bribes 
thirtyfive former government and colorado party officials were 
arrested after the coup 
the ruling colorado party said it would hold a convention soon to 
choose new leaders and candidates for the general elections 
the setting of an election date so quickly caught opposition 
leaders off guard several said they didnt think they could 
organize in time and early elections gave a tremendous edge to the 
colorado party 
this date was arrived at without consultation said domingo 
laino leader of what is thought to be paraguays biggest opposition 
group the authentic radical liberal party i personally cant 
even be a candidate for anything because im not registered 
in the past weve called for electoral abstention he said 
our people are not registered on the voter lists it seems to us 
that this early election could be interpreted as a trap 
rodriguez said all parties except those that are communist 
would be allowed to enter candidates our constitution doesnt 
consider the communist party to be democratic he said 
several colorado party leaders have indicated its candidate for 
president might be luis maria argana the foreign minister in the 
provisional government rodriguez appointed 
when asked whether he might be a candidate himself rodriguez 
smiled and said the colorado party not i selects the candidate 
i am simply a soldier not a politician however if i can be useful 
to my country i will do what i am asked

discoverys astronauts ran through 
emergency drills at the launch pad monday and their commander said 
he was confident engine pump problems would be resolved in time for 
a midmarch launch 
pad safety personnel briefed commander michael coats and his four 
crewmates on escape routes and other procedures in case there is a 
fire or other problem on the pad during the countdown 
included was a demonstration of a basket filled with ballast 
zipping down a 1200foot slide for life wire that runs from the 
spacecraft cabin level 195 feet above the ground this is the 
quickest escape measure and at the bottom the astronauts have a 
choice of entering a concrete underground bunker or driving away in 
a tanklike vehicle 
at the base of the launch pad technicians were removing the 
turbopumps from discoverys three main engines they will be 
replaced by three new pumps because of two tiny cracks discovered in 
a pump bearing shaft following the december flight of the shuttle 
atlantis 
the decision to replace discoverys pumps has delayed the launch 
from feb 23 until march 10 at the earliest 
officials said last week that if discovery does not get off the 
only available shuttle launch pad by march 18 the mission might 
have to be delayed until later in the year 
thats because the following shuttle mission that of atlantis 
has only a 30day period starting april 28 during which its crew can 
dispatch the magellan spacecraft to probe the planet venus 
nasa wants to preserve that entire launch window if possible 
because venus will not come into position as a target again until 
1991 
coats told reporters after mondays escape drills that he is 
confident about a midmarch launch 
we were discouraged about a week ago because the first 
analysis indicated it might take too long a time to get the new 
pumps and that there would be no way we could launch in march he 
said now everybody weve talked is very optimistic were 
confident theyve got a good fix on it now 
arnold aldrich the agenys national space transportation system 
director said in washington on monday he is confident of launching 
discovery without affecting the atlantis launch 
we believe this work has proceeded well since we started to 
build up the new pumps and barring any hiccup we believe we can 
well support an adequate launch window to launch sts29 discovery 
and still give full coverage to the window for magellan he said 
aldrich said if discovery is close to launching but cant make it 
by march 18 officials would consider launching atlantis later in 
its window 
he said nasa is aiming currently to launch discovery by march 14 
and that a firm date will be set march 3 following a twoday launch 
readiness review 
on tuesday astronaut coats and his crew will don their bulky 
spacesuits and climb aboard discovery for the final two hours of a 
countdown rehearsal

after five days of interviewing prospective 
jurors the judge in oliver norths irancontra trial said monday 
that he expects the selection process to end tuesday with a jury 
being impaneled 
i expect to be able to put a jury into the box tomorrow said 
us district judge gerhard a gesell after declaring six more 
people to be qualified to sit on the jury 
the number deemed qualified by gesell stood at 29 women and 9 men 
all black except for one white woman 
gesell also ordered that the jury will not be sequestered kept 
apart from family and normal life to avoid contact with news reports 
about the trial expected to last up to five months 
the minimum needed for the panel was 40 under this arithmetic 
there will be 12 jurors and six alternates the defense will be able 
to reject 10 members of the panel without stating a cause the 
prosecutors 6 in addition each side can have three alternates 
excused 
gesell is aiming for a pool of more than 40 a number that allows 
for any lastminute dropouts for reasons of illness or financial 
hardship the normal challenges to jurors for cause have been 
taken care of in the course of individual questioning that began 
last tuesday 
gesell said originally he wanted the panel to have 50 members 
but he reduced that number to 45 last week and said at the end of 
the court day monday he wanted at least 44 more prospective jurors 
will be questioned tuesday from a pool of 40 to be brought in 
norths lawyers had asked that the jurors be sequestered in his 
written order gesell did not state a reason for turning them down 
saying only that the court does not presently intend to sequester 
the jury 
north is accused of 12 crimes carrying a maximum of 60 years in 
prison 
after the court day gesell held a closeddoor session to hear 
independent counsel lawrence walsh gesell said only that it was 
concerning his classified document problems 
the national security agency strongly objected last month to 
attorney general dick thornburgh about classified information to be 
presented in the case and said it warranted blocking the trial 
thornburgh rejected the nsas suggestion 
only those prospective jurors who say they heard read or saw 
none of norths extensive televised irancontra testimony before 
congress in 1987 are being admitted into the jury pool so far 
norths defense has voted against nearly all those chosen on one 
ground or other 
i understand your position everybody is disqualified 
gesell told north lawyer barry simon on monday 
under the rules of the court the defense later will be allowed 
to remove 10 people from the pool and the prosecution 6 without 
stating a reason each side also gets three each of such peremptory 
challenges when it comes to choosing the alternates the jury will 
be composed of 12 jurors and 6 alternates 
one woman accepted for the jury pool is an office clerk who said 
she recalled seeing a july 1987 magazine with norths picture on the 
cover but didnt recognize north in the courtroom and when asked 
whether she had heard of him said no i never have 
five prospective jurors were excused in rapid order monday 
morning one because her boyfriend was on the grand jury that 
indicted north 
another who was excused told the judge that what she can recall 
from the hearings is only vague she said she had the television on 
but i was listening and not listening her dismissal came when 
she said she head heard on television that there had been shredding 
of documents and lying to congress 
the charges against north include lying to congress in 1985 and 
1986 about his efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contras and lying 
to the attorney general about the national security councils role 
in diverting money from the iran arms sales to the contras

kitty dukakis the wife of gov michael s dukakis 
is being treated for alcohol problems triggered by her husbands 
loss to george bush in the 1988 presidential election the governor 
said monday 
mrs dukakis was not known to be dependent on alcohol until the 
governors statement but she has had a history of addiction to diet 
pills she entered a minnesota treatment center in 1982 where she 
said she conquered her dependency 
until shortly after election day on nov 8 kitty had never had 
a problem with alcohol dukakis said in a statement 
he said that since the presidential campaign mrs dukakis 52 
used alcohol in excessive quantities on a limited number of 
occasions while at home 
as she has now discovered whether it comes in a bottle or is 
solid if you are chemically dependent you are chemically 
dependent dukakis said at a news conference 
dukakis who does not smoke and rarely drinks even a glass of 
wine said his wife had entered the edgehill newport facility in 
newport ri on sunday and will stay there about a month 
she recognizes it it was her decision to go into treatment 
dukakis said adding that he and their children supported her choice 
it is a disease from which you never recover youre always 
recovering he said calling her alcohol problem another 
manifestation of her underlying chemical dependency 
mrs dukakis said in july 1987 early in her husbands 
presidential campaign that she had recovered five years earlier 
from a 26year addiction to mild amphetamines she began taking as a 
teenager to control her weight 
she won praise for her candor and became an active campaigner 
often appearing as a surrogate for dukakis 
the couple was at home in suburban brookline during the weekend 
and there was no specific incident or accident that prompted the 
decision to seek treatment according to dukakis spokesman james 
dorsey 
mrs dukakis problem was caused by a combination of physical 
exhaustion the stress of the campaign effort and the postelection 
letdown the governor said 
we know how loved and respected she is both here in the 
commonwealth and across the nation and she is grateful for the 
love and support she has received from so many good and decent 
people dukakis said 
dorsey said the problem which he refused to characterize as 
alcoholism flared up in the three months since the election and 
did not involve a renewed use of drugs other than alcohol 
mrs dukakis has been prominent in the fight to educate 
youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse 
since the presidential defeat mrs dukakis has launched a career 
as an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her husbands side 
on several occasions when she might have been expected 
on jan 3 for example when dukakis made the surprise 
announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor some 
observers remarked on the fact that mrs dukakis was not present 
dukakis left open the possibility that he would run for the white 
house again in 1992 
in 1983 mrs dukakis took the lead in the states great 
american smokeout and announced that she was quitting cigarettes 
after smoking since age 14 but she quickly became a chronic quitter 
dukakis said that when his wife gets out of edgehill i expect 
that she will resume a very active and busy schedule

the governments top delegate to historic 
talks with the opposition opened the first session monday by 
offering to legalize solidarity if the union agrees to economic and 
political reforms 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak seated opposite 
solidarity leader lech walesa called for the opposition to 
participate in polands government 
fiftyseven delegates from the government the opposition and the 
roman catholic church gathered for the talks at the ornate council 
of ministers palace the building where the warsaw pact was created 
the delegates met for about three hours and issued a short 
communique that said talks by three working groups would resume 
wednesday one group will consider economic and social policies 
another political reforms and the third the issue of allowing more 
than one union to exist 
we were brought together here by the sense of responsibility 
for the future of our motherland we are all responsible for the 
poland to be kiszczak told the participants the staterun news 
agency pap reported 
we must accept the philosophy of necessity alongside that of 
the gradual character of transformations he said as it goes 
for trade union pluralism there is no question if but the point is 
how 
we demand solidarity we have the right to it walesa said in 
his speech pap reported 
walesa blamed polands economic and political crisis on a lack of 
freedoms but said he sensed the government was ready for change 
staterun tv reported 
we know the country is in ruins but it has not been ruined by 
gnomes but by the system of carrying out power which has been 
depriving people of their rights and wasting the fruits of their 
labor walesa said 
the time of social and political monopoly is ending we need a 
restructuring that will turn the oneparty state into a state of the 
nation and the society he said 
known as the round table the talks are the first between 
solidarity and the government since the union was suppressed by the 
martiallaw crackdown in december 1981 
if we work out at the round table a confirmed consensus on 
the idea of nonconfrontational elections as well as support for 
planned political and economic reforms there will be an immediate 
possibility to allow more than one trade union to exist at a given 
factory kiszczak said 
kiszczak called for changes in electoral laws and a new 
parliament that would represent a coalition of forces 
solidarity has expressed willingness to see the opposition enter 
parliament but it is reluctant to endorse opposition participation 
in a cabinet that despite reform is likely to be dominated by the 
communist party 
kiszczak a member of the ruling politburo said if solidarity 
were legalized it cannot return to old ruts becoming the source 
of anarchy and tensions 
walesa accepted all of kiszczaks suggestions in the name of 
the side he represents polish tv reported 
we are saying words but poland needs facts new brave 
actions all poles will take account of our every word and every 
decision and also and maybe first of all our lack of decisions 
walesa was quoted as saying 
the biggest problem we have to fight now is the catastrophe of 
the polish economy he said 
both sides agree that compromise is essential if poland is to 
overcome its huge 389 billion debt and chronic consumer shortages 
the talks were given heavy tv coverage throughout the night and 
the communist party daily trybuna ludu came out with an extra 
evening edition 
government spokesman jerzy urban told reporters that authorities 
were satisfied with the session 
the speeches showed a rather convergent way of thinking about 
the future and about the changes necessary in poland urban said 
kiszczak proposed the talks in august 1988 during the countrys 
worst wave of strikes in seven years but walesa refused to commit 
solidarity until the authorities agreed to legalize the union 
in a dramatic reversal of its sevenyear stand against 
solidarity the communist party central committee on jan 18 
approved such a plan four days later the union said it was willing 
to talk 
the participants represent the major political and social forces 
in the country and include the official trade union opzz the 
peasants party and the roman catholic church 
hundreds of cheering solidarity supporters waved at the union 
delegation outside the palace 
polish tv carried a live broadcast of the delegates taking their 
seats walesa led the solidarity delegation into the palace and 
grinned after he took his seat at the pine table specially built for 
the talks 
opposition activists expect the talks to continue for about six 
weeks

i welcome the leaders that are with me here on this platform 
i think their support says a lot about the efficacy of our 
proposal 
and now i propose to take just a few questions 
on the technical aspects i will defer to these people and then 
ill be glad to turn this over to secretary brady 
i believe we start with helen and then terry and then get going 
q mr president are you guaranteeing that the extra costs 
premium increases and so forth will not be passed on to the 
depositors taxpayers and also what is your responsibility in this 
debacle i mean the reaganbush deal for deregulation of business 
and banking 
a on the first place were not guaranteeing that 
i would hope that wouldnt happen but theres no guarantee what 
the institutions will do 
secondly theres enough to be said for everybody in this 
together trying to solve this problem 
so i cant equate any personal im not inclined to go into any 
personal blame simply to say that weve got to solve this problem 
and were on the path to doing that 
yeah terry 
q mr president the house votes tomorrow on that controversial 
pay raise plan and the senate has already voted against it would 
you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise not only for the members 
of congress but also for federal judges and other high officials in 
the government 
a i said i support it 
yes 
q mr president there is a feeling that part of this problem is 
attributable to deregulation of the financial industry in 
retrospect do you think that deregulation might have gone too far 
in the last 10 years or so and in the future is your marching 
order to your administration to be a little more careful in 
regulating this particular industry 
a jerry i dont know the answer 
id be most interested to know what our experts here feel about 
whether how much of the problem could be attributed to 
deregulation 
i just dont know the answer to your question 
so i cant reply 
yes 
q mr president you have placed considerable stress in these 
early days of your presidency on ethics and propriety yet in recent 
days theres this controversy on capitol hill concerning the 
propriety of senator towers alleged behavior and questions raised 
over the weekend about the financial arrangements on the private 
funds of the man in charge of ethis your counsel boyden gray and 
other questions involving members of the administration or 
memberstobe of the administration and i wonder sir whats 
happened here is it too harsh behavior on our part too lax 
behavior on your part what 
a i dont think anything has happened 
i learned long ago in public life not to make judgments based on 
allegations 
but having said that i want to have my administration aspire to 
the highest possible ethical standards 
and we have appointed a commission to go out there now and try to 
detail what these standards should be 
and we are in a new era on these matters matters that might have 
been approved and looked at one way may have a different perception 
today 
and so what i want to do is finalize our standards and then 
urge everybody in all branches of government to aspire to those 
standards

the head of a stateowned company 
linked to construction of an alleged chemical weapons plant in libya 
was quoted as saying monday that scores of western companies 
unwittingly helped build it 
but the official ernst pieper president of the salzgitter ag 
concern did not name any of the companies der spiegel newsmagazine 
reported 
according to our current information in addition to us about 
100 german european and american companies were involved in the 
pharma 150 and in such a way that none appears to have had an 
overview of the entire project der spiegel quoted pieper as 
saying 
pharma 150 was the code name used for the factory in rabta south 
of tripoli which us officials say is a chemical weapons plant 
libya says the plant makes pharmaceuticals 
a salzgitter subsidiary delivered switching equipment worth 
540000 to the rabta plant as well as blueprints and piping 
pieper was quoted as saying in the spiegel interview that salzgitter 
was duped into delivering the equipment by imhausenchemie a west 
german company based in lahr 
imhausenchemie is the target of a criminal probe into its 
dealings with libya 
pieper was quoted as saying his company believed the equipment 
was going to a plant in hong kong that imhausenchemie allegedly set 
up to conceal its dealings with libya the equipment never reached 
hong kong and is suspected of having been diverted to libya 
the disguise appears to have been so perfect that none of the 
many companies involved realized at the time who was behind the 
project and where the deliveries where going to pieper was quoted 
as saying 
the salzgitter president said in der spiegel he did not believe 
that imhausenchemie knew how to build a chemical weapons plant

more than 500000 people will need 
emergency food relief in the southern sudan this year but a un 
agency is having trouble delivering shipments officials said monday 
the world food program said it is facing tremendous logistical 
problems in moving desperately needed relief food to the southern 
provinces of the wartorn country due to bad roads and lack of 
proper equipment 
the agency the food aid arm of the united nations said its 
first overland shipment of food in more than four months recently 
arrived in the town of kaya near the ugandan border it consisted of 
220 tons of corn aboard 16 trucks 
the agency suspended ground shipments late last year after 11 
drivers were killed when sudanese rebels attacked a truck convoy in 
september 
the agency said it was organizing a second truck convoy to carry 
another 400 tons of corn to kaya 
in a statement issued in italy the agency said more than 150000 
refugees have flocked to camps in juba about 90 miles north of 
kaya it said they need 2000 tons of food monthly but that an even 
greater amount must be delivered and stockpiled before roads are 
made impassable by the start of the rainy season in late april or 
early may 
if overland transport proves insufficient to fulfill needs 
the world food program may consider initiating a new airlift to 
juba the agencys statement said 
the agency ended an airlift to the provincial capital in december 
after delivering 3700 tons of food but several other 
organizations including the european community and the 
international committee of the red cross are continuing flights 
the un agency said little or no food has been delivered to more 
than 200000 refugees in bahr el ghazal and upper nile provinces 
both far north of the ugandan and kenyan borders it said 500000 
sudanese will need emergency food this year

but i do think rick that its fair that we not reach judgment 
on senate hearings before the senate hearings are concluded because 
its very hard to filter out fact from fiction spurious allegation 
from fact 
and i am not about to make a judgment based on a sensationalized 
newspaper story 
im simply not going to do that 
that wouldnt be fair and im not sure how ethical it would be 
so lets wait and see 
this youre referring to the tower matter up there 
that matter has been looked at by the fbi 
the committee now has that 
they have the responsibility to make determination 
and ill be very interested to see what they say 
but i am not going to make conclusions jump to conclusions 
based on stories that may or may not have any validity at all 
yes 
q mr president even if as your spokesman says you do you 
continue to back senator tower for the position there are those 
youve heard who say that the best thing he could do for you is to 
step aside because even if confirmed he then would become 
damaged goods weaker in administering a very very tough job 
on your behalf how do you respond to that suggestion 
a well i think people would not want a person to step aside 
given rumor particularly if the rumor is baseless 
and the process what the problem is the process is taking a 
little longer than i would like and yet i think the senate has got 
to do what theyre doing looking at these allegations very 
carefully 
but you know as i said here at this same podium a while back 
the american people are basically fair 
and if these allegations prove to be allegations without fact 
behind them i think the people are going to say wait a minute 
what went on here how come it was all this wed read this one 
day and then kind of a puff of smoke the next 
and so i dont think in your substantive question though that 
if it proves if the senate committee gives its endorsement to the 
senator particularly after all of these allegations that there is 
any danger at all of damage to his credibility or his ability to do 
the job 
yes 
q mr president there are new and substantive allegations that 
senator tower lost control over the highly classified security 
documents and computer disks that were used in geneva under his 
watch if those allegations prove to be founded would you then 
withdraw his nomination 
a i would not answer hypothetical questions of that nature 
youre telling me something that i havent heard before 
and we did have access to fbi reports 
so if this matter is now before the congress let them 
investigate it 
but i cant go into a hypothesis 
all i would be doing would be adding to i think speculation 
that is not helpful at this juncture 
q but sir will you pursue these allegations in the executive 
branch are you going to track what the fbi is looking into are you 
going to personally surveil these kinds of allegations yourself 
a every rumor and every innuendo no 
but if you make if theres some substantive allegation of this 
nature of course it would concern me 
yes 
q mr president back to sampls if we might millions 
laughter millions of americans save alternatively that is they 
put their funds in mutual funds stocks and that kind of thing as 
i read it youve now outlined a plan that places a lot of the sampl 
bailout on the backs of the general treasury how fair is that 
a weve got a major problem and something has to be done 
and this is the fairest system that the best minds in this 
administration can come up with 
and so id i again would ask you to ask the specifics of 
the treasury burden to the chairman of the federal reserve or the 
secretary of the treasury 
ask how they see that

but look as ive said there is no easy answer to this 
all i want to do is make a sound proposal work to put it into 
effect and have that proposal such that the country wont have to 
face this problem again 
yes dave 
q mr president you said you dropped the deposit fee idea but 
this plan youve given us has an increase in premimums that may be 
paid by consumers as well as a large amount of taxpayers money 
isnt that the same thing consumers and taxpayers are still going 
to have to pay the price for this 
a well as i indicated earlier on there is no guarantee of 
passing this on to the consumer nor is there a guarantee it wont 
be passed on 
but this arrangement has been there since for 50 years 
and you might argue whether its been passed on or not i just 
dont know i havent seen the flowthrough in the industry 
but nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of 
this magnitude 
yes 
q mr president youve talked to several members of congress in 
various receptions and dinners and personal conversations over the 
past couple of weeks in many of them you discussed your plan for 
this problem what is your feeling for the reception that its going 
to get on capitol hill and of the selling job that it will make you 
have to get it passed 
a we may have a big selling job 
but ive been encouraged so far with the spirit epitomized by the 
members of congress particularly at the joint leadership meeting 
the other day 
we didnt go into every detail of this these plans were still 
being formulated and i wanted to get their views 
i was encouraged by what bill seidman told me earlier on about 
how he what he felt the receptivity of the plan will be 
but i dont think its fair to the congress to say that they have 
signaled to me that they are going to be enthusiastic on this plan 
although i hope they are 
yes 
q mr president 
a im going to take about three more and then turn this over to 
these gentlemen here who are prepared to go into as much detail as 
you want 
yes 
q mr president on these allegations that surround tower now 
at least variations on the theme surfaced early in the transition 
allegations of womanizing and taking money from defense contractors 
that sort of thing have you satisfied yourself that he is still the 
nominee you want and can you give us at this time a wholehearted 
endorsement of tower 
a yes i can and i will right now because some of the very 
same allegations that were floated that long ago apparently have 
been looked at and examined by the best possible examiners im 
talking about the fbi and found to be groundless 
so therefore im not about to change my view 
now if somebody comes up with facts i hope im not narrowminded 
enough that i wouldnt take a look but i am not going to deal in 
the kinds of rumors that ive seen reported and then knocked down 
and then reported and then knocked down 
yes

alcoholism experts praised kitty dukakis on monday 
for seeking treatment of alcohol abuse after a relatively brief bout 
of heavy drinking following her husbands loss of the presidential 
election 
doctors attributed the familys quick action in part to their 
awareness of addiction problems following mrs dukakiss earlier 
struggle with a dependence on diet pills 
for a public figure who knows any revelation about problems is 
going to be widely publicized it takes great courage to seek 
treatment said dr domenic ciraulo of new england medical center 
in boston 
this is a family that certainly knows about substance abuse 
he said its unusual to seek help so early but it shows they 
know the signs of trouble so well 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis said monday that his wife 
had been admitted to a private hospital in newport ri he said she 
had never had a drinking problem until shortly after the nov 8 
election which dukakis the democratic nominee lost to george bush 
unfortunately a combination of physical exhaustion the stress 
of the campaign effort and the postelection letdown all combined to 
create a situation in which on a limited number of occasions while 
at home she has used alcohol in excessive quantities the 
governor said 
mrs dukakis was treated in 1982 for a 26year reliance on 
amphetamine diet pills 
dr peter nathan director of the rutgers centers for alcohol 
studies in piscataway nj said that if the drinking only began in 
november there probably has not been time for mrs dukakis to 
become physically dependent on alcohol 
if what the governor says is accurate they have been quite 
courageous in deciding to do something about this early nathan 
said the odds are far better that they will be able to get it 
under control and there wont be any permanent consequences 
dr patricia sutker of the veterans administration medical center 
in new orleans said that seeking treatment for alcohol abuse does 
not necessarily mean someone is an alcoholic 
you could go in because you dont like the fact that you drank 
heavily on a few occasions she said you want to nip it in the 
bud she might not be an alcoholic and wants to go in for some 
stress management 
several experts said that people who already have had one form of 
addiction are susceptible to developing another 
drug switching does occur and the drug thats easiest to 
switch into is alcohol said dr roger weiss of mclean hospital in 
belmont mass its easy to get cheap legal and the most 
socially acceptable 
the experts discounted the once popular notion that some people 
have addictive personalities instead they said that abusers of 
drugs and alcohol tend to have little in common except their 
addiction 
ciraulo said people may turn to a variety of moodaltering 
substances as a way of coping with their problems 
as a way to deal with stress and pain alcohol or any other 
drug is an effective way on a temporary basis to relieve it he 
said some people may also experience depression or psychological 
pain more intensively than others and then use drugs or alcohol as a 
way to treat their own pain

q mr president there have been hints that gorbachev may 
propose a test to defuse the situation in central america i wonder 
if you see the possibility of superpower deals in central america 
and if so what you if you could suggest what would be acceptable 
to you 
a i dont know about a deal but i can see a possibility of 
cooperation in central america because i would like the soviets to 
understand that we have very special interests in this hemisphere 
particularly in central america and that our commitment to 
democracy and to freedom and free elections and these principles is 
unshakable 
and i dont think they really have substantive interests in this 
part of the world certainly none that rival ours 
so i would like to think they would understand that 
and there are so many areas where we could demonstrate a new 
spirit of cooperation and this would clearly be one of them 
so id like to think that is the way that the matter would be 
approached by the soviets 
yeah a followup 
q could i follow up and ask you whether an understanding on 
central america whether youd be willing to include abandonment of 
aid to the contras as part of such an understanding 
a i wouldnt make a deal on that with the soviets nor would 
that come up 
i dont believe youd ever have a i cant see a situation of 
that nature arising knowing as i do what will be negotiated and 
discussed with the so i think thats a so hypothetical as to not 
even be a possibility of any kind 
yeah charles and then i do have to run 
q mr president we still dont know what the taxpayers burden 
is in here out of this 40 billion and cents first from sampl funds 
and the shortfall from treasury funds how big is it and have you 
in going through your budget had to knock out some things to pay 
for this 
a weve had to knock out a lot of things on the overall budget 
for a lot of different reasons but id like to leave this to dick 
for the questioning to give the specific amounts 
it is shared as ive indicated and he can give you the amounts 
that are involved

the speaker of the house jim wright caved in 
monday to opponents of a 51 percent congressional pay raise 
conceding the majority has spoken in demanding a vote that will 
likely keep senators and representatives from getting any increase 
wright set the vote for tuesday the senate was expected to 
quickly give its assent and sent legislation halting the raise due 
to take effect at 1201 am wednesday to president bush senate 
republican leader bob dole said he expects bush to sign it 
the vote wright said will be on a simple resolution of 
disapproval of the raises which would also affect federal judges 
and top executive branch officials 
wright had planned to let the raise take effect wednesday then 
have the house vote the next day to scale it back to 30 percent 
members of congress would have seen their annual salaries jump at 
least temporarily from 89500 to 135000 
the speaker relented after opponents won a dramatic vote to keep 
the issue alive on the house floor he said the chamber will vote 
tuesday and promised the majority will rule 
the resolution would then go to the senate which voted 955 
thursday for a differently worded rejection measure 
that chambers majority leader sen george j mitchell dmaine 
said he hopes and expects to bring up whatever the house sends 
over and send it to the president before the raise becomes law 
according to mitchell aides 
bush at a late afternoon news conference was asked would you 
sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise not only for the members of 
congress but also for federal judges and other high officials in 
the government 
he answered in an apparent reference to the pay raise i said 
i would support it 
but mitchells republican counterpart sen bob dole rkan 
told reporters 
i understand hell sign it he needs to do it by midnight so 
the judiciary doesnt get a big step while everybody else is being 
stepped on 
the constitution forbids raises for judges from being reduced 
once they take effect 
wrights turnaround came after pay raise opponents mustered a 
23888 majority against a house democratic leadership motion to 
adjourn 
the majority has spoken and the majority will speak 
emphatically wright said afterwords 
one leading opponent of the raise consumer advocate ralph nader 
said wrights capitulation showed he had realized that the power 
of the people is greater than the power of his tyranny in trying 
to close down the house of representatives until the members got 
their salary increase 
the chairman of the house democratic caucus rep bill gray 
dpa predicted there would be no pay raise no change in the 
lawmakers salary gray also said he doubted the house would move to 
ban speaking fees and other honoraria a plan favored by wright in 
return for the raise 
gray said members feared a vote to end mondays debate and 
adjourn was going to be interpreted as a vote on the pay raise 
he said any vote to increase lawmakers salary now would fail even 
if its a vote on 4 percent it aint going to pass gray added 
this pay raise is dead said rep thomas tauke riowa an 
architect of the opposition strategy 
tauke however said he expects congress to take up the issue 
later along with a review of honoraria often paid to members by 
special interests seeking to influence legislation 
the vote and wrights subsequent announcement came after majority 
leader thomas foley dwash presiding over mondays session 
refused to recognize a payraise opponent who wanted to introduce a 
resolution calling for a vote on the hike 
that set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debate 
between the two sides 
from the start the house electronic tote board showed the 
adjournment motion by house majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
was losing 
wright last week conducted a private survey of house members and 
said the results showed they did not want a vote before the raise 
took effect despite that random surveys by the associated press 
and other organizations showed sentiment in favor of a vote 
a weekend gallup poll indicated overwhelming public opposition to 
the pay raise the gallup organization asked 1001 adults from 
friday through sunday whether they favored or opposed increasing 
congressional pay from 89500 to 135000 the results with a 4 
percent margin of error showed 82 percent opposed it with only 15 
percent in favor 
meanwhile the president of the american bar association 
addressing the groups convention in denver urged members to call 
their congressmen to register their support for the pay raise for 
judges robert raven the associations president then gave his 
listeners the phone number of the congressional switchboard 
besides the raise for members of congress the presidential 
commission proposed 
increasing the presidents pay from 200000 to 350000 and the 
vice presidents from 115000 to 175000 the raises would not 
affect president bush and vice president dan quayle 
raising the salaries of top federal officials now in the range 
of 75500 to 99500 to a range of 115000 to 155000 
hiking the salary of the chief justice from 115000 to 175000 
and the salaries of associate justices of the supreme court from 
110000 to 165000 
raising the pay of federal appellate judges from 95000 to 
140000 and that of federal district judges from 89500 to 
135000 
retired congressmen presidents vice presidents top federal 
officials and other federal judges would also receive higher 
pensions under the commissions proposal

president bush said monday there is a chance 
for a new spirit of cooperation between the soviet union and the 
united states in solving central american problems 
bush was asked at a news conference if he foresees a deal with 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev to resolve the regions problems 
which include a superpower dispute over leftistruled sandinista 
the soviets help supply the sandinista while the united states 
provides aid to the antinicaraguan contra rebels 
bush said he wouldnt make a deal on contra aid but added i 
can see a possibility of cooperation in central america 
the soviets dont have substantive interest in that part of the 
world certainly none that rival ours so i would like to think they 
would understand that bush said and there are so many areas 
where we could demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation and this 
would clearly be one of them 
the united states has an unshakable commitment to democracy 
freedom and free elections in the fivenation region he said 
bush hasnt spelled out his central american policies 
particularly the contra aid question and the fighting in neighboring 
el salvador between the usbacked government and leftist rebels 
bush said he is reviewing the policy of his predecessor ronald 
reagan which involved unswerving support for military aid to the 
contras 
but officials have said no contra aid will be sought in the near 
future and the administration is willing to support regional efforts 
toward a diplomatic solution to the contra war 
bush and secretary of states james baker havent yet named a new 
assistant secretary of state for latin america 
baker has settled on bernard aronson a democrat who helped the 
reagan administration win contra aid but the appointment hasnt 
been announced said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the previous holder of the post elliott abrams discussed 
nicaragua during several meetings with soviet officials but no 
substantive action ever came of the meetings 
the united states has continually objected to the soviet supply 
of weaponry to nicaraguas leftist government saying the shipments 
continued through 1988 even after us arms to the contras were 
stopped 
vice president dan quayle visited the region last week and met 
with presidents of the four central american democracies el 
salvador honduras costa rica and guatemala 
the united states refuses to meet with nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega on the grounds that he should conduct talks first with 
the contras 
quayle said the administration supports the regional effort by 
the five presidents to reach a diplomatic solution 
bush sent a message last week to the salvadoran military and the 
government urging human rights improvements quayle deplored human 
rights violations from the leftist guerillas and the right wing 
factions and indicated that unless el salvador improves its record 
us aid to the country would likely be jeopardized

biologists edward b lewis of the california 
institute of technology and john b gurdon of britains cambridge 
university were awarded the 1989 wolf prize in medicine monday for 
their work in molecular biology 
the 100000 prize will be presented to them in may 
lewis 70 a native of wilkes barre pa was recognized for his 
studies of genes in fruit flies that serve as master plans for the 
insects growth and might help explain some birth defects in humans 
lewis has been a professor of biology at caltech for 40 years is 
a graduate of the university of minnesota and a past president of 
the genetics society of america 
working with the drosophila fly lewis identified a group of 
genes known as the bithorax complex in the cell nucleus the 
foundation said 
the genes work at the earliest stages of an embryos development 
to control formation of a flys head chest and abdomen as well as 
formation of wings and other organs included in those body segments 
lewis said 
homeo boxes which are portions of homeotic genes havent 
changed much since the fly and are found in mice and humans in 
which they also help direct formation of the head chest and 
abdomen he added 
thus some basic and very ancient parts of genes that control 
anatomy are shared by flies mice and humans lewis said 
gurdon 55 a native of dippenhall hampshire and a graduate of 
christ church college oxford has been at cambridge since 1972 
the professor of cell biology was cited for his work with frogs 
he found that certain cells taken from the organs of a mature animal 
contain all the genetic information necessary to produce a frog the 
foundation said he showed such cells could be made to develop into 
tadpoles 
the wolf foundation was set up in 1975 by ricardo wolf a 
germanborn chemist who emigrated to cuba and later served as its 
ambassador to israel he died in israel in 1981

listen thank you all very much 
and now im going to turn this over to secretary brady 
and then i in order i guess theyll refer to each of these 
others 
huh 
q mr president one more word for the word for the small 
q back here mr president 
a what was that substantive question laughter 
q all the way in the back we didnt see you get back in this 
area 
a we didnt get that far back no 
but if theres been an egregious offense to those in the back 
benches i will take one parting question and inasmuch as you 
raised it fire away 
q thank you very much mr president back on the ethics issue 
a couple of your prospective 
a mindful that the last question always does get you in great 
trouble go ahead laughter 
q a couple of your prospective nominees one of your 
prospective nominees and your counsel have just recently changed 
their minds on matters that would have violated the ethics rules 
under the reagan administration did you have difficulty in getting 
the word out that times would be tougher under your administration 
a no i dont think so 
for example if youre referring to the boyden gray matter which 
i think you are that matter was reviewed every single year by the 
office of government ethics 
and he was deemed in compliance every single year 
but now weve got a new ball game here 
hes the general counsel here in the white house and im the 
president 
and ive set out rhetorically the highest possible standards and 
were trying to back that up by findings from this commission 
and so i do think that that weve got weve got to be very 
careful about perceptions of impropriety when it comes to conflict 
of interest not rumors or innuendoes of one sort or another 
i dont think you can i should deal in those things 
but when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest id like 
our people to bend over backwards 
and i think thats what has happened in both the question of lou 
sullivan whether hes entitled to all he did was ask am i 
entitled to continue these arrangements with this small university 
and all boyden did in my view now is to try to go a step beyond 
what the government ethics office has said to avoid the perception 
of impropriety 
but so i think it might be different now 
i have to approach it differently as president not that you have 
lower standards but i just think that again this whole question of 
perception weve got to look at it very very carefully 
but i want to be fair 
i do not want to have the loudest charge no matter how 
irresponsible be that that sets the standards 
weve got to achieve more objective standards 
and thats why im putting a lot of faith in the hope to put a 
lot of faith in the findings of judge wilkey and former attorney 
general griffin bell 
and they will be looking at all these matters in terms of 
reality and then to some degree im sure in terms of perception

so what might be legal and what might be perfectly sound 
ethically might have to be altered given this new approach because 
of perception 
its a delicate one 
i dont want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible 
way that good people just throw up their hands and say look who 
needs that kind of grief who needs it why should i have to give up 
all my whatever it is my health plan from the xyz company 
and yet on the other hand were in a different time now were 
in a time when weve got to try to set these standards as high as 
possible 
so i think dr sullivan did the right thing in asking what was 
proper 
i think boyden gray did the correct thing every year in asking 
what was proper and reviewing his own personal holdings in a family 
company with the ethics office but now taking another step because 
of perception in this case 
so weve got to reach weve got to work with these individuals 
to find the proper answer and weve got to work with the commission 
to try to codify these standards 
q sir if i might follow up you said during the campaign very 
clearly that your staffers would not take outside income i wonder 
why they need a legal opinion to understand that 
a they had a legal opinion saying it was perfectly proper from 
this family company 
and so now were changing that and saying look theres this 
different perception problem here in this new era so lets bend 
over as far backwards as we possibly can to recognize that 
thank you all very much 
q what about leveraged buyouts mr president 
a theres your lbo man right there referring to brady

jan timman of holland fought back from a 
losing position with black on monday to defeat lajos portisch of 
hungary in the fifth game in his world chess championship candidates 
quarterfinal 
with only one more game to go timmans victory tied the match at 
2525 portisch won the third encounter in the sixgame match last 
week and the other three games played so far ended in draws 
the 37yearold dutchmans performance in mondays action was not 
the sort that will earn his win a place in chess theory books 
needing at least a draw to keep alive his chances against the 
51yearold hungarian timman chose a somewhat unusual variation of 
the modern defense in an apparent effort to offset his opponents 
opening advantage 
but portisch one of the worlds greatest opening theoreticians 
played as if he had seen it all before 
with a series of strong confident moves he built up a vastly 
superior position sacrificing an exchange to blast a trail for his 
center pawns on their advance to eventual promotion 
my god was all timmans west german second vlastimil hort 
could say when he studied the position after the first twenty moves 
dutch grandmaster genna sosonko was more explicit 
its sad he commented but all black can do now is hope 
for white to make a mistake it would not be the first time portisch 
gets nervous when he seems to be winning 
for 10 moves however the hungarian did just fine steadily 
working on his pawn advance and increasing the pressure on blacks 
hedgedin troops 
but when the crucial moment came and one of his advanced pawns 
was on the verge of reaching the eighth rank portisch made a 
serious error allowing timman to return the exchange and even out 
completely 
a few moves later it was timman who had the upper hand and he 
made no mistakes a black pawn supported by queen and bishop 
reached the second rank and portisch had to weaken his position in 
order to block it 
timman was at his best in this stage exploiting whites 
weaknesses to the full and gradually gaining command of the whole 
board 
portisch soldiered on for a while but resigned at his 47th when 
he stood to lose a piece 
the hungarian will be playing black in wednesdays sixth game of 
the match which will go into overtime with a twogame extension if 
neither player manages a win 
in case the extension fails to produce a winner a series of 
suddendeath rapid games at increasing speeds will have to decide 
the outcome of the contest 
the winner of the candidates series will challenge world champion 
garri kasparov for his world title in 1990

residents of britain who are suspected of being 
nazi war criminals could be tried quickly if the government enacted 
simple changes in the law a parliamentary committee said monday 
nazihunters have accused britain of delaying action on fugitive 
nazis and their collaborators including a lithuanianborn man the 
simon wiesenthal center of los angeles says was involved in killing 
thousands of jews 
the war crimes group with members from all parties said british 
laws could be amended within six months to give courts jurisdiction 
over war crimes committed abroad by people who were not british 
citizens at the time 
parliament has amended laws to allow prosecution of hijackers 
terrorists and others who committed sufficiently grave crimes 
abroad and later obtained citizenship the committee said 
the crimes under consideration principally those of murder 
manslaughter and genocide were all criminal according to the 
general principles of law recognized by civilized nations at the 
time of their commission according to the 71page report 
it said australia and canada had enacted such laws since 1987 in 
order to prosecute war criminals 
the government is expected to complete an investigation next 
month of allegations that nazis who committed war crimes in world 
war ii are living in britain investigators also are considering 
whether the law can be amended to allow prosecution 
philip rubenstein secretary of the committee said it fears the 
government will delay action for two or three years even though 
amending the statutes requires extremely minor legislation the 
report said 250 people are being investigated for possible war 
crimes 
last summer the wiesenthal center gave the government a list of 
13 alleged war criminals it said had come to britain the home 
office said it would try to trace the men russians now aged 6389 
whose names were first submitted by the soviet ambassador in 
november 1947 
the wiesenthal center has identified 400 alleged war criminals in 
eight western countries the most publicized british case is of 
antanas gecas born in lithuania and now living in scotland who 
acknowledges witnessing killings but denies involvement

president bush on monday stood by john tower 
his embattled nominee to be secretary of defense and said the 
former texas senator shouldnt have to withdraw because of rumors 
about his personal life 
the confirmation process is taking a little longer than i would 
like and yet i think the senate has got to do what theyre doing 
looking at these allegations very carefully bush said 
bush added that if any rumors or innuendo turn out to be a 
substantive allegation of this nature of course it would concern 
me 
he said he still endorses tower but added if somebody comes 
up with facts i hope im not narrowminded enough that i wouldnt 
take a look but i am not going to deal in the kinds of rumors that 
ive seen reported and then knocked down and then reported and then 
knocked down 
tower has subject of allegations that he is a womanizer and has a 
drinking problem 
the administration said fbi investigations into the matter had 
turned up nothing that would prevent tower from carrying out his 
task as head of the pentagon 
but the senate armed services committee last week put off a 
thursday vote on tower s confirmation saying two new allegations 
came up that had to be checked out 
although bush said the fbi report was delivered monday to the 
committee the panels chairman sen sam nunn dga and ranking 
republican sen john warner rva said they hadnt seen any such 
document 
nunn said we have not had anything delivered to us and we are 
awaiting on it so the status quo is right where it was asked 
about bushs statement nunn elaborated that weve done some 
talking back and forth but weve received no report whatsoever 
bush refused to speculate about the tower rumors if this 
matter is now before the congress let them investigate it but i 
cant go into a hypothesis all i would be doing would be adding to 
i think speculation that is not helpful at this juncture bush 
said 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan said at a news 
conference that towers confirmation chances had probably not been 
hurt by delay in a vote 
we should get the nomination out dole said if we 
investigated every rumor about every senator we wouldnt have a 
quorum around this place i checked as late as 4 pm and i havent 
learned anything new the fbi should wrap up its investigation by 
tomorrow morning 
asked about suggestions from some quarters tower should withdraw 
bush said i think people would not want a person to step aside 
given rumor particularly if the rumor is baseless 
tower participated in white house sessions on the defense budget 
both on saturday and again monday said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said

israel formally asked the united states on 
monday to stop talking to the plo and top leaders began a campaign 
to convince the us administration that plo chairman yasser arafat 
broke a pledge to end terrorism 
an israeli diplomat delivered the request to the state 
departments bureau of near east affairs sources in washington said 
on condition of anonymity 
israeli leaders cited the case of five palestinian guerrillas 
killed saturday night by israeli soldiers in south lebanon near the 
israeli border israels embassy in washington submitted information 
identifying details and additional facts linking the plo to that 
squad israel television said 
state department spokesman charles e redman said were looking 
into whether the encounter saturday violated arafats renunciation 
of terrorism other officials said the united states was seeking 
additional information 
in jerusalem foreign minister moshe arens accused the palestine 
liberation organization of breaking a promise to refrain from terror 
and gave the firefight as evidence 
in a speech to american jewish leaders he said israel was urging 
the united states to reconsider its dialogue with the plo on grounds 
the conditions for such contact had been clearly and unequivocally 
violated 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said threats by arafat against 
palestinians who might negotiate with israel were the worst terror 
more important even than an attempt to infiltrate from lebanon 
on the main shopping street of arab east jerusalem police fired 
rubber bullets tear gas and a water cannon to subdue dozens of 
palestinian stone throwers who smashed cars and shop windows 
arab witnesses said the demonstrators blocked the street with 
blazing tires and overturned garbage bins israel radio said two 
police officers suffered minor injuries 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers shot and wounded a 
15yearold palestinian girl in the leg during clashes arab doctors 
said the army said it was checking the report 
also monday assailants set fire to the israeli tax office in the 
occupied west bank town of qalqiliya an army official said the top 
floor of the twostory building was gutted the official said 
hamas a moslem fundamentalist group claimed responsibility for 
the attack in slogans sprayed on city walls tax boycotts are part 
of the palestinians 14month uprising against israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
the revolt which has taken the lives of 374 palestinians and 15 
israelis was largely responsible for the more moderate stance 
arafat stance that led the united states to open a dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization 
us officials opened talks with the plo in december after arafat 
renounced terrorism and said he accepted israel israeli officials 
were shocked at the us move which ended a 13year boycott 
the jewish state considers the plo a terrorist group and refuses 
to talk with it 
the army said the guerrillas slain saturday were en route to 
carry out an attack against targets inside israel the guerrillas 
had hand grenades a pistol equipped with a silencer and wire 
cutters army officials said 
three were identified as members of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine a marxist plo faction and the other two as 
members of the radical palestine liberation front 
on sunday the groups issued a statement saying the target was 
within the israeli security security zone in south lebanon 
but on monday israel radio reported they issued another 
statement that said the failed attack was an answer to the 
attempts by some palestinian leaders to put an end to military 
struggle against zionism 
the statement reportedly said the two groups would not stop 
antiisraeli attacks from lebanon as instructed by arafat 
arens in a speech before the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations said the us conditions for a 
dialogue with the plo as they were set forth by the state 
department have been clearly and unequivocally violated 
i presume that in washington they also noticed what happened 
but to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed we will 
draw his attention to it arens said 
seymour reich head of the us group said the jewish leaders 
would pressure the bush administration to end contacts with the plo 
im not sure the administration is prepared to cut off the 
dialogue yet reich said but were going to press on them these 
issues 
israels supreme court meanwhile ruled that military officials 
can be forced to disclose secret evidence against palestinians 
facing deportation an israeli defense lawyer said 
the ruling came on an appeal by balal shakshir a palestinian 
from the west bank city of nablus who was ordered deported last 
year said leah tzemel one of his lawyers 
in previous appeals military prosecutors did not have to show 
the defendant evidence against him if the defense ministry said the 
information was classified shakshirs appeal is continuing 
since the uprising began 49 palestinians have been deported to 
lebanon from the occupied lands

the last military convoys rolled north 
toward the border monday soviet officials said more than a week 
before the deadline for the red army to leave a frustrating war in 
which it lost more than 13000 men 
a soviet military spokesman said less than 20000 soviet soldiers 
remain in afghanistan and that they were moving toward the border on 
monday 
but in kabul hundreds of soviet soldiers still guarded the 
airport where military transports brought in food and fuel to ease 
shortages caused by a blockade of the capital by moslem guerrillas 
who surround it 
in moscow the communist party newspaper pravda said the last 
soviet soldier left kabul on sunday soviet officials in the 
afghan capital however said about 1000 red army troopers would 
remain at the airport until the end of next week 
eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister met with 
officials in neighboring pakistan but did not find a way to end the 
11yearold civil war peacefully he said monday the soviets would 
continue supporting the marxist government in kabul but would not 
send troops back into the country 
soviet envoy yuli vorontsov left tehran after talks with afghan 
guerrillas leaders in iran afghanistans neighbor on the west 
he said he hoped all political forces would join a coalition 
government after the soviets are gone irans official news agency 
reported but the insurgents have consistently refused such 
proposals 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 
growing in numbers to an estimated 115000 by the time the 
withdrawal began may 15 under a unmediated agreement 
all are to be out of the country by feb 15 the kremlin says 
more than 13000 soviet soldiers were killed and 35000 wounded in 
the nine years

left their garrison the last soviet military complex in the 
country they said the soldiers headed out of the western city over 
the weekend to meet a convoy at herat and were expected at the 
border wednesday or thursday 
pravda said soviet troops had moved defensive checkpoints on the 
salang highway to about 50 miles north of kabul at a tunnel through 
some of the roughest terrain of 260mile withdrawal route 
pravda said insurgents did not attack soviet convoys on the 
salang the only land route to the soviet border from the capital 
but four avalanches crashed down on retreating columns sunday it 
reported three soldiers killed and one injured 
terrorist grenades wounded three soviet officers who were 
handing over vehicles to the afghan army sunday in a kabul suburb 
the paper said 
at termez a soviet border city where an airborne regiment 
arrived monday from afganistan lt col igor korolev said the last 
red army soldiers were moving toward the border 
the military spokesman said a total of 20000 troops were still 
in the provinces of balkh samangan baglan and parvan between 
kabul and the soviet border to the north and in the northwestern 
afghan province of herat 
thousands of residents servicemen and relatives greeted the men 
of the 350th parachute regiment as they came across the friendship 
bridge over the amu river into termez the unit had been in 
afghanistan since 1984 
a brass band played soldiers waved flags and stuffed red 
carnations into the muzzles of their submachine guns 
on the road behind the kabul airport by contrast several young 
soviets clutched their rifles nervously as they manned checkpoint 
bunkers 
andrei a 20yearold from moldavia said he and the others would 
be flown home before feb 15 but had not been told exactly when 
tass the official soviet news agency said guerrilla shelling 
killed eight people in kabul province it said one person was killed 
and two were wounded in the cities of gardiz and khost in paktia 
province 
rockets and rocketpropelled grenades hit residential areas in 
herat and the airport at kandahar in the south the agency said 
guerrillas control nearly the afghan countryside and when the 
soviets are gone holding the cities will be left to afghanistans

the white house asked congress on monday to 
reschedule confirmation hearings for louis sullivan the health and 
human services secretarydesignate in the wake of his decision to 
forfeit nearly 300000 from his medical school presidency 
no hearing date had been set by late monday afternoon 
the move by the administration signaled that the white house is 
satisfied with sullivans financial disclosure and the fbi 
background check which had been cited earlier as reasons to 
postpone a previously scheduled hearing 
the hearing was put back on track after sullivan decided to forgo 
297000 in funds due him from his contract with the morehouse 
school of medicine in atlanta which he founded and heads as 
president 
in a white house statement issued last weekend sullivan said he 
had agreed to take an unpaid leave of absence to avoid any 
appearance of a conflict of interest between the hhs job and 
morehouse which receives about 58 million a year in federal funds 
sullivan had originally asked the white house for permission to 
take a paid sabbatical from morehouse after having worked at 
morehouse for 13 years he was entitled to a twoyear leave at half 
pay about 200000 total according to a senior administration 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the office of government ethics at first glance approved the 
request but later reversed itself because the schools sabbatical 
policy did not apply uniform standards to everyone at the school 
regardless of their situation the source said 
sullivan however had another source of potential income from 
morehouse that met with approval of the ethics office the white 
house counsels office and the justice department the source said 
that was a severance clause in his fiveyear contract as president 
on which he has 20 months left under that clause he was entitled 
to pay for those 20 months 297000 if he severed his ties with 
the school the official said 
sullivan decided to take the severance pay and cut his ties with 
morehouse the official said explaining that the atlanta doctor 
is not someone with a lot of independent means and wants to keep 
his atlanta home during his tenure in washington 
however after news reports appeared about a possible 
arrangement sullivan felt he was taking a beating in the press 
and decided on balance it was just not worth it the source said 
sullivan now plans to borrow money and his wife a lawyer will 
go back to work to make ends meet the official said 
in atlanta sullivan earned 172000 a year as morehouse 
president as hhs secretary he would make 99500 though that 
could go up to 155000 if congress approves a pending pay raise 
sullivans decision to forgo the money surprised many in the 
nations capital though ethics officials say it is not unusual for 
people entering government to give up large sums of money due them 
from former employers 
there are government people who give up unbelieveable sums to 
take government positions because they are afraid it could 
create a problem for them said don campbell deputy director of 
the office of government ethics it happens with frequency 
however there are also people at sullivans level who do take 
large sums from former employers deferred income that is 
legally theirs because it had been earned before they came to the 
government or money afforded them in a contract buyout clause for 
example 
the new agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter last year 
while he was us trade representative received 561602 from the 
chicago mercantile exchange for an annual installment for deferred 
earnings plus the aftertax proceeds of a lump sum distribution 
yeutter had been president of the exchange before joining the reagan 
cabinet 
sullivan however feared that his leave from morehouse combined 
with controversy over his statements about abortion and the fbis 
focus on his connection to a georgia politician convicted of 
extortion could affect his crediblity and that of the bush 
administration the source said 
the official quoted sullivan as saying that he simply accepted 
this as unfortunate but this is a cost of becoming part of the 
government 
on capitol hill sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
senate finance committee which will hold sullivans confirmation 
hearing praised the nominee saying his decision to give up the 
funds shows a major personal commitment to public service 
sen ted stevens ralaska said he admired sullivan for his 
decision but said no one should be pressured to give up funds to 
which they are legally entitled 
we have so much pressure in the government only those born 
with two gold spoons in their mouth will be able to serve around 
here pretty soon he said it is impossible for me to understand 
this pressure that comes on people who were not born wealthy and who 
have earned a certain right

a convoy of soviet paratroopers came home 
from afghanistan on monday to a bittersweet brassband welcome and 
a military spokesman said 20000 soviet soldiers remain in the 
country 
the 350th parachute regiment which had been stationed in 
afghanistan since 1984 rumbled across the friendship bridge 
spanning the amu river and into termez red flags waving and 
headlights shining on the 60 tanks and armored personnel carriers 
a 20piece military band played the soviet national anthem and 
martial airs 
the 300 paratroopers commanded by lt col alexander skachkov 
were presented with red carnations which they pushed down the 
barrels of the weapons on their armored vehicles and into the 
muzzles of their submachine guns 
that sign of peace marked the end of their involvement in the 
conflict that took the lives of more than 13000 soviet soldiers and 
injured 35000 others 
soviet officials brought about 150 foreign correspondents to this 
border town in soviet uzbekistan for the welcoming ceremonies 
despite the publicity effort the welcome was a relatively 
lowlevel affair the highestranking official to speak was valery 
sudarenkov first deputy prime minister of uzbekistan 
hayratan afghanistan on the other side of the river is the 
terminus of the salang highway from kabul the main withdrawal route 
of the soviet soldiers 
convoy after convoy of withdrawing soldiers reached the border 
area in the past week but uzbekistan officials bused in hundreds of 
school children and workers to give an official welcome to the 350th 
parachute regiment 
the workers and students were entertained with loud popular 
music including american artist stevie wonders i just called to 
say i love you and ate food provided by several dozen specially 
installed stands 
a freight train carrying military equipment could be seen 
crossing the bridge before the spectators pressed to the edge of the 
reviewing stand to catch the first glimpse of the returning warriors 
just before the welcome military spokesman lt col igor korolev 
said the last remaining soviet soldiers in afghanistan were on the 
move toward the border 
korolev said that as of 8 am monday more than 30000 
soldiers have left in the second half of the withdrawal 
the soviet union withdrew half of its 100000 soldiers from 
afghanistan by aug 15 and must complete the second half of the 
pullout by feb 15 under a unbrokered agreement the kremlin 
intervened militarily in afghanistan in december 1979 
korolev said fewer than 20000 soviet soldiers remained in balkh 
samangan baglan parvan and herat provinces and that they were 
moving toward the border on monday 
herat as well as the four northcentral provinces between kabul 
and the border are along main withdrawal routes 
the soldiers are returning to a society where the opposition of 
many to the afghanistan war and indifference to their service have 
caused returning soldiers difficulty in adjusting 
dozens of people in the crowd in termez were searching for 
familiar faces among the group of returning afghanistan veterans 
one of the few who were successful was maria sabriba who found her 
grandson eldar galiev 
the diminutive grandmothers face lit up as she told reporters 
she had seen her grandson she said he had written a letter saying 
he was in mongolia rather than afghanistan so that she wouldnt 
worry about him 
at least hes healthy she said beaming 
sudarenkov the uzbekistan official said we wish you to join 
the front ranks of those fighting for revolutionary change in 
soviet society 
the tanks armored personnel carriers and armored cars that 
carried the returning soldiers held banners proclaiming peace to 
you afghanistan and the order of the fatherland has been 
fulfilled

the nations largest organization of lawyers went 
on record monday in favor of legislation to bar discrimination 
against homosexuals 
the american bar association which twice before rejected similar 
proposals endorsed a resolution supporting federal state and local 
legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation in employment housing and public accommodations 
the abas house of delegates the policymaking body for the 
350000member lawyers organization voted 251121 to adopt the 
resolution 
members said the action will have important symbolic and 
practical impact in influencing lawmakers to adopt gayright 
measures 
the house of delegates also approved by voice vote a proposal 
calling for increased federal regulation of the insurance industry 
the proposal urges passage of federal legislation repealing the 
antitrust exemption the insurance industry was granted by congress 
in 1945 
the aba resolution is a response to the socalled liability 
crisis in which lawyers and insurance companies have blamed each 
other for the skyrocketing costs of liability insurance 
proponents of the gayrights resolution noted that many states 
and cities already have legislation to protect the rights of 
homosexuals 
many states and cities already have legislation to protect the 
rights of homosexuals 
laws banning discrimination in public employment based on sexual 
orientation have been adopted by california illinois maryland 
michigan minnesota new mexico new york ohio oregon 
pennsylvania rhode island and washington state many cities have 
enacted more sweeping protection 
in a debate that was at times emotional proponents of the 
gayrights measure said the aba is behind the times in speaking out 
in behalf of homosexual rights 
its a question of basic human rights said alexander forger 
a lawyer from new york city what we do here today is simply make 
a statement in favor of decency and human rights a compassionate 
voice for social justice 
but opponents of the resolution said the aba is taking sides with 
perversion and the corruption of children 
the aba is encouraging a federal statute that will invade the 
rights of every american said augustine smythe of charleston sc 
we shouldnt ram it down peoples throats with a federal 
statute he said 
joe stamper of antlers okla said the resolution endorses 
homosexual conduct a majority of americans looks with distaste on 
perversity that violates our religious precepts he said 
the abas house of delegates rejected a similar proposal by nine 
votes in 1985 and by 24 votes in 1983 in 1987 the group approved a 
resolution condemning crimes of violence based on prejudice against 
the victims race religion sexual orientation or minority status 
supporters of the gayrights proposal emphasized that homosexuality 
is not a matter of choice for most 
they also said there is no scientific evidence to show 
homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children 
alice richmond of boston said its important to me to separate 
out conduct that would be offensive whether by heterosexuals or 
homosexuals she said that when she was in the sixth grade she 
succeeded in getting a male teacher fired for making sexual advances 
to her endorsing equal treatment for homosexuals does not mean 
condoning conduct that would be offensive or illegal she said 
earlier monday chief justice william h rehnquist called for 
measures to limit the time in which death row inmates may challenge 
in federal court their convictions and death sentences 
rehnquist said such a limit should be combined with expanded 
legal help for those accused of capital crimes to ensure that 
constitutional challenges to death penalty sentences are handled 
more efficiently

united nations nicaraguas foreign minister on monday proposed 
a joint uscentral american campaign to wipe out the diabolical 
scourge of drug trafficking in the region 
miguel descoto met reporters after talking to secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar about a proposed international military 
observer force to police the central american peace plan 
descoto is leading a meeting wednesday and thursday of foreign 
ministers of nicaragua honduras costa rica guatemala and el 
salvador which signed the 1987 peace plan 
we will be proposing an agreement between the central american 
republics and the united states on the elimination of illegal drug 
trafficking said descoto 
this is a scourge on the world we were very very happy to see 
the priority that president bush gave to this issue in his inaugural 
address he said 
the united states backs the rebels seeking to overthrow the 
leftist sandinista government in nicaragua but the nicaraguan 
government has spoken in favor of improving relations with the 
united states since the change in us administrations last month 
descoto said nicaragua is volunteering to draft an agreement 
that would be submitted to the other central american countries and 
the united states followed by a meeting of those involved in 
managua 
descoto would not provide other details of the proposal and 
declined to say whether nicaragua would be prepared to share 
intelligence data or coast guard duties with the united states 
we would be proposing to go as far as we should go in order to 
really stamp out this diabolical sourge to humanity he said 
panama which is ruled by gen manuel antonio noreiga is 
considered part of south america not central america 
noreiga has been charged with drug trafficking in us federal 
courts but says the charges are false and are an attempt to lay the 
groundwork for abrogating the treaty under which control of the 
panama canal will pass from the united states to panama 
nicaragua has defended noriega saying he is a victim of us 
persecution intended to undermine panamas sovereignty 
the central american foreign ministers are meeting in new york to 
set the agenda for a summit meeting of their five presidents feb 
1314 in el salvador to try to revive the peace plan 
the peace initiative which calls for democratic reforms in 
central american countries has stalled over the lack of full 
compliance by its signers

improvement over the weekend according to a hospital spokeswoman 
the 71yearold marcos recognized family and friends and was able 
to respond to simple commands such as to raise his right hand said 
st francis medical center spokeswoman norma kop 
marcos remained in the intensive care unit attached to a 
respirator to regulate his breathing kop said 
hes still in critical but hes showing signs of 
improvement she said hes more alert 
marcos has been hospitalized since jan 15 with pneumonia and 
bronchial asthma while in the hospital he suffered a collapsed 
lung which was reinflated and underwent a tracheotomy to relieve 
the buildup of fluids in his lungs 
along with his wife imelda marcos was indicted last october on 
federal racketeering charges accusing him of plundering his 
homelands economy and stashing much of the money in the united 
states a hearing this week in new york to decide whether he is 
healthy enough to stand trial has been postponed until march 6 
assistant us attorney debra livingston confirmed that the 
hearing before us district judge john f keenan had been put off 
at the defense request 
ms livingston would not comment on why the defense had sought a 
delay saying it was not on the public record

thursday in the hospital and said marcos should be forgiven and 
allowed to die in his homeland where he ruled for 20 years 
philippine president corazon aquino has refused to meet with 
laurel and receive a message from marcos 
it is not a matter of me not wanting to talk to him but i feel 
since he says this is a matter of great import to the filipino 
people i think he should inform the people directly instead of with 
me because people might have the wrong impressions that we are 
keeping something from them mrs aquino said monday in manila 
marcos was ousted in a february 1986 civilianmilitary revolt and 
has lived in hawaiian exile since with mrs aquino forbidding his

socialist michael manley expected to 
defeat conservative prime minister edward seaga in this weeks 
election said monday he would restore diplomatic relations with 
cuba but give higher priority to us ties 
manley said he wants a new beginning with the united states 
and and would visit washington before restoring ties with fidel 
castros communist government 
the 64yearold former prime minister in an interview at his 
kingston home with seven foreign correspondents said he saw clear 
opportunities for cooperation with the united states including 
cracking down on drug trafficking through jamaica 
an opinion poll published sunday put manleys leftleaning 
peoples national party 14 points ahead of seagas centerright 
jamaica labor party 57 percent to 43 percent 
thursdays voting will be the first nationally contested election 
since 1980 when 700 people were killed in politically related 
violence during a ninemonth campaign at least eight people have 
been killed and scores injured in political attacks since this 
campaign opened jan 15 
police said eight people were wounded in three separate shootings 
sunday night in and near kingston the capital six people were 
attacked leaving a political meeting two others a 22earold man 
and a 15yearold boy were hit by shots fired from passing buses 
carrying political supporters 
nevertheless the violence has not been anywhere near as intense 
or widespread as it was in 1980 
manleys party boycotted the last election in 1983 in a dispute 
over voter registration lists at the time seaga one of the reagan 
administrations closest allies in the caribbean was riding a wave 
of popularity following his outspoken support of the 1983 us 
invasion of grenada the boycott left seagas party with all 60 
seats in parliament 
manley who was prime minister for eight years during the 1970s 
said he was confident of winning at least 40 parliamentary seats to 
seagas 20 
manley reiterated his pledge to restore diplomatic relations with 
neighboring cuba but he said he would not bring back droves of 
cuban doctors and builders as he did in the 1970s 
manleys close ties with cuba alienated the united states and 
foreign investors leading to economic decline seaga broke 
relations with cuba shortly after taking office for the first time 
in 1980 
asked about his image as a radicalturnedmoderate manley 
rejected the notion he espoused farleft views 
i never was what you call a hardline socialist said manley 
who is vice president of the influential movement socialist 
international ive always belonged to that broad family of social 
democracy 
what i really am if you want to know is a hardline 
democrat he continued but not democrat vs republican 
democrat in the sense that i really believe my abiding commitment 
is to the democratic process

banks and foreign exchange houses 
were ordered closed monday as the government grappled with how to 
lower interest rates while keeping the currency stable 
the economy ministry ordered the closings late sunday night after 
a week in which the austral fell to 1759 to the dollar on the open 
market monthly interest rates to 17 percent or more and the 
central bank lost nearly 500 million in foreign exchange 
the government ordered a 25 percent devaluation in the official 
value of the austral to 1441 australs to the dollar effective 
tuesday when the banks and foreign exchanges were scheduled to 
reopen 
also beginning tuesday the central bank which has spent at 
least 1 billion in recent months in an effort to hold down the 
dollar no longer will make dollars available on the free market 
the former commercial rate which was higher and at which the 
government used to sell dollars and make a profit will be replaced 
by a special rate equal to the official rate plus 25 percent 
ie 1801 australs per dollar beginning tuesday 
the free rate will be whatever the market will bear the central 
bank no longer with try to keep the black market value of the 
dollar within 20 percent of the official value 
the problem as always is inflation which was an unexpectedly 
high 89 percent in january a rise from decembers 68 percent and 
novembers 57 percent and an indication that despite strenuous 
efforts the government is losing control 
in august president raul alfonsin implemented a program of 
voluntary wage and price controls budget cuts and regular 
minidevaluations in the austral 
to persuade argentines not to trade their money for dollars 
which deprives the banking system of funds and drives up interest 
rates the central bank made plenty of dollars available interest 
rates were kept attractively high though well below levels of last 
july and august 
through november the plan seemed to work inflation and monthly 
interest rates both returned to single digits the dollar rose 
modestly and of crucial importance argentines purchasing power 
recovered from the months when it lagged behind inflation national 
elections are set for may 14 
critics said any improvement was illusory because it was obvious 
the dollar was undervalued and as soon as that was common 
knowledge speculators would buy dollars in anticipation of profits 
one indication that was near was argentines huge rush to buy 
airline tickets figuring that as they were denominated in dollars 
they could be bought at a substantial discount 
by the governments tallies the austral lost 42 percent of its 
value since september while the dollar rose by only about 27 
percent 
middleclass argentines who ordinarily might have vacationed at 
the atlantic coastal resort mar del plata 250 miles south of buenos 
aires decided to vacation in brazil tickets to cuba also were 
particularly cheap and popular

a man accused of killing 14 relatives in 
a christmastime rampage went on trial monday for the slayings even 
though he has said he is ready to die for his convictions of two 
other murders 
two of the 89 potential jurors were excused during preliminary 
questioning monday after that individual questioning began to 
select a panel for the trial of r gene simmons 
earlier monday circuit court judge john s patterson denied a 
motion to let the jury decide whether the deaths of simmons 
relatives were part of the same criminal episode in which two people 
were killed in russellville on dec 28 1987 simmons 48 was 
convicted may 12 for those slayings and sentenced to death he told 
patterson he was ready to die and did not want his sentence appealed 
eight prospective jurors were excused by patterson four said 
they thought simmons was guilty one of those excused robert e 
humphrey said i think he ought to get 30 days in the electric 
chair and the dogooders who intervened last time when he asked to 
be executed ought to have to hold his hand 
four jurors were selected monday 
the state indicated it would call 20 witnesses in the current 
trial the defense indicated it would call three 
simmons first trial was moved to ozark because of publicity in 
russellville and the second trial was moved to clarksville for the 
same reason patterson addressed that issue when he asked the 
potential jurors is there anybody who has not heard anything 
about this case 
nobody raised their hand 
patterson told the jury that he realized that the court cannot 
make you just wipe things out of your mind and forget it but that 
verdicts must be based upon a higher quality of evidence than what 
is sometimes reported by the media 
the new trial is for the shooting and strangulation deaths of 
simmons wife becky 46 their seven children two of the 
childrens spouses and four of simmons grandchildren one of whom 
relatives say he fathered by incest with one of his daughters 
patterson also presided over simmons earlier trial 
simmons surrendered after the shooting spree that left two people 
dead and authorities then went to his home 14 miles north of 
russellville they found five bodies the next day they discovered 
seven bodies in a grave and found the bodies of two babies in the 
trunks of cars 
prosecutor john bynum said he would ask for the death penalty 
the jury could give simmons life imprisonment without parole

a sentencing hearing began monday 
for 25 blacks who could face the death penalty for their alleged 
complicity in the mob killing of a policeman 
the socalled upington 25 are believed to be the largest group 
ever convicted in a south african murder trial 
their case is similar to that of the sharpeville six a group 
of blacks reprieved from the gallows last year by president pw 
botha following a storm of international protest 
in both instances the prosecution was unable to show that most 
of the defendants physically contributed to the killing however 
the judges found the defendants guilty under the doctrine of common 
purpose which holds them responsible because they were part of a 
crowd that intended to kill the victim 
the upington 25 were convicted of murder last year for the nov 
13 1985 killing of a black policeman lucas sethwala who was 
assaulted and set alight by members of the mob after they chased him 
from his house 
evidence presented at the trial identified four of the 25 as the 
men primarily responsible for the assault that killed sethwala 
judge jj basson convicted the remaining 21 because he said they 
shared the same intent 
the group began attacking sethwala and his house after police 
broke up a rally protesting a rent increase and other grievances 
black activists have attacked hundreds of black policemen in recent 
years saying they are collaborators with the whiteled government 
the upington 25 have received scant publicity because the town is 
located in the isolated northwestern part of south africa 
however when the sentencing hearing began monday morning the 
packed courthouse included both south african and foreign 
journalists it was not immediately clear how many days the hearing 
would last 
during the hearing defense lawyers will call expert witnesses to 
argue that the judge should not impose the death sentence because of 
extenuating social and political factors 
the upington 25 range in age from 21 to 64 and include three 
women all are from paballello a black township on the edge of 
upington 
the sharpeville six five men and a woman are serving prison 
terms ranging from 18 years to 25 years which were imposed when 
botha commuted their death sentences 
botha has never explained his decision to intervene although 
most observers said the extensive international pressure persuaded 
him to block the executions

authorities have canceled the great prayer 
festival a sacred annual event in tibet that last year was the 
scene of antichinese violence that claimed more than 20 lives 
the official xinhua news agency said monday the festival in the 
tibetan capital of lhasa was canceled by the tibet branch of the 
buddhist association of china and other buddhist organizations 
the decision was made after taking into consideration the 
opinions of the majority of lamas xinhua said it said related 
religious activities could be conducted in monasteries 
the festival which begins the eighth day of the first month of 
the tibetan calendar usually takes place in february and march 
the xinhua report did not say whether the riots last march were 
responsible for the decision to cancel this years festival 
it also did not mention whether the jan 28 death of the panchen 
lama tibetan buddhisms secondmost revered man after the exiled 
dalai lama was related to the cancellation 
on march 5 the final day of the 10day event buddhist monks 
broke up the ceremonies by shouting antichinese proindependence 
slogans starting riots that led to an estimated 24 deaths 
chinese authorities said one policeman was killed in the riots 
twentyfive rioters were given prison terms 
chinese authorities hailed the opening of last years festival as 
an example of how religious freedom is now protected in china and as 
a sign that lhasa had returned to normal following riots the 
previous september and october 
the great prayer festival which dates back to 1409 was halted 
by the communists in 1960 a year after a failed uprising drove the 
dalai lama into exile and not held again until 1986

all 33 foreigners on trial for refusing to be 
fingerprinted under japans alien registration law said monday they 
will reject a planned amnesty marking emperor hirohitos funeral 
the 30 koreans two americans and one chinese said the amnesty 
would leave them unable to challenge the controversial law in court 
the laws opponents say it violates the human rights of japans 
approximately 870000 foreign residents by requiring them to be 
fingerprinted and carry an alien registration card at all times 
the government has declared an amnesty that will in the name of 
the late emperor dismiss our court cases and nullify all attempts at 
legal redress the group said in a statement not only is the 
government denying us due process the right to a fair trial and 
the right to appeal it is also trying to silence us hide the past 
and distort history 
many of japans foreign residents are koreans or chinese whose 
parents or grandparents were brought forcibly to japan as laborers 
while their countries were controlled by japan before and during 
world war ii 
foreigners born in japan do not automatically receive japanese 
citizenship and often face discrimination in schools housing 
marriage and employment 
government officials say they plan to pardon about 30000 people 
for minor criminal offenses including violations of the alien 
registration law to commemorate emperor hirohitos funeral on feb 
24 
the court is one of the few places where koreans and chinese 
can challenge the law said robert ricketts of scottsdale ariz 
one of the americans in the group when i was found guilty of 
violating the law i was told i have the right to appeal but now 
im told i dont have that right its an attempt by the 
government to get rid of these trials which have attracted a lot of 
attention in japan and overseas 
in its statement the group charged that militarists used 
hirohito and the emperor system to rally national support for 
colonizing neighboring countries and killing millions of people in 
world war ii 
we are challenging not only the alien registration system 
itself but also the imperial ideology that undergirds it and that 
continues to legitimize and perpetuate ethnic discrimination and 
oppression in postwar japan the group said 
conviction under the law carries a penalty of up to a year in 
prison and a 1500 fine

japanese officials discounted us congressional 
concerns monday and said they hope to proceed with coproduction of 
a jet fighter by general dynamics and the japanese company that 
built the famous zero during world war ii 
some us senators say the project will mean giving away us 
high technology that might allow japan to compete against the 
american aerospace industry us officials pushed for last years 
coproduction agreement to offset japans trade surplus 
the two sides spent a long time working on the agreement and i 
believe its a good agreement a foreign ministry official said on 
condition of anonymity i hope we can proceed with development as 
scheduled 
during prime minister noboru takeshitas visit last week to 
washington five us senators urged president bush to review the 
agreement to use the us f16 built by general dynamics as the 
basis of japans future mainstay fighter jet called the fsx 
japanese officials said japan originally planned to develop the 
40 million plane on its own 
weve told the us government that we dont need any 
technology for the plane from the united states said a high 
defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity we had 
hoped to develop it alone but because of us requests we agreed 
to codevelopment of the plane 
he said the f16 technology would probably make the project go 
more smoothly but it isnt clear how much it will actually 
benefit japan 
under the current agreement reached after several years of 
negotiations mitsubishi heavy industries is to head development 
using technology from japan and from the f16 
the american company is to act as a subcontractor to mitsubishi 
and receive about 3545 percent of the work funded entirely by the 
japanese government 
the japanese technology likely to be used in the plane includes 
sophisticated radar advanced materials and a special control system 
used to maneuver short additional wings called canards which allow 
the plane to move horizontally or vertically without any change in 
the angle of the planes body 
initially 130 of the planes are to be built with a possible 
followup order of about 100 more each fsx will cost 40 million 
defense officials say 
although japan has made several types of aircraft including the 
ys11 civilian transport plane its aviation industry remains small 
during world war ii the nation turned out 25000 military 
aircraft a year including the famous mitsubishi zero fighter but 
after japans defeat us occupation forces closed down the 
industry until 1952 when japanese companies began servicing us 
planes during the korean war 
since then the industry has relied heavily on defense contracts 
including the development of japans current fighter jet the f1 
and production of f15 fighters under license from mcdonnell douglas 
of the united states

hovercraft named yunus after the hebrew prophet jonah who was

fars province can carry 12 people transport loads up to one ton

the homeless man accused of strangling a pregnant 
doctor told police a voice ordered him to kill the pathologist 
according to court papers filed monday 
dr kathryn hinnant 33 was raped sodomized and strangled with 
a wire in her small office jan 7 at bellevue hospital 
shortly after his arrest steven smith 22 told a detective that 
during the attack she asked me why am i doing this according 
to the detectives report 
the detective david argenzio reported that he asked smith what 
his response was after a pause he asked again 
he stated to me it was just something i had to do the 
detective reported 
the exchange took place while smith talked continuously in a 
room at kings county hospital jan 9 sometimes about things 
unrelated to the murder argenzios report said 
but most of the time he went on about how he had to do it 
because something inside of him makes him do it the report said 
smith said that if someone had given him psychiatric help the 
slaying wouldnt have occurred and the lady would still be 
alive the detective reported 
the crime reminded smith of an incident involving his girlfriend 
in south carolina the report said 
argenzio quoted smith as saying that a voice had told him to stab 
his girlfriend but he had forgotten where he put his knife so he 
beat her she survived the beating 
he went on to say that is why he knew he had to strangle the 
lady because of something inside of him like a low voice 
telling him 
smith has pleaded innocent to charges of seconddegree murder 
firstdegree rape sodomy and firstdegree robbery 
defense lawyer marvyn kornberg said he will probably present a 
psychiatric defense for smith a mental outpatient at kings county 
hospital for three years kornberg said smith is under suicide watch 
at all times at the hospital

cartoonist doug marlette whose work brought the 
atlanta constitution a share of its first pulitzer prize in 20 
years resigned monday to join newsday 
marlette was brought to the atlanta newspaper from the charlotte 
nc observer by former constitution editor bill kovach kovach 
resigned three months ago in a dispute with senior executives 
constitution editorial page editor tom teepen said he knew of no 
disputes particularly involving the cartoonist there have not 
been any clashes here over cartoons teepen said 
but the 39yearold marlette said in his resignation letter that 
he had been upset by kovachs departure 
as a native southerner i came here inspired by the vision of 
bill kovach for worldclass journalism in this region so richly 
deserving of it marlette wrote tragically that dream was 
thwarted like many southerners before me i head north with a sense 
of sadness and longing for what might have been 
marlette in an interview monday with wsbtv in atlanta made no 
mention of any disputes or other problems 
leaving is a very sad thing i feel real ambivalence about 
it he said at the same time im excited about the 
opportunity 
marlettes 1987 work at both the observer and the constitution 
won a 1988 pulitzer prize 
obviously the addition of an exceptional talent such as doug 
marlette to the editorial pages of newsday and new york newsday will 
strengthen what we believe to be the best viewpoints in the new york 
area said robert m johnson publisher of newsday in a statement 
newsday has three editorial cartoonists 
marlette will begin work for newsday based on new yorks long 
island in around three weeks teepen said adding that he was 
not sure if the cartoonist would produce any more drawings for the 
constitution while he prepares to move 
well be bringing in a good editorial cartoonist teepen 
said were looking at some folks 
marlette also writes the syndicated comic strip kudzu he 
was the first cartoonist to win a nieman fellowship at harvard 
university

in addition the national security council has created a special

energyrelated terrorism in the united states would be a 
particularly significant threat in a military crisis involving the

there is the possibility that potential third world adversaries

as a broiling summer day dissolved into a 
sultry night at new yorks coxsackie state prison joseph puma 
waited to see if five prison guards held hostage by prisoners would 
make it out alive 
after 14 hours about midnight the inmates released their 
hostages 
this guy came out a friend of mine he was bloody beaten 
battered and he wore inmate clothing he just collapsed in my arms 
crying said puma head of the state prison guards union 
puma saw the pain in the faces of the guards and their families 
and came up with an idea the union through lloyds of london 
established a captivity coverage insurance plan with benefits 
to be paid to survivors of prison uprisings 
its believed to be the first time an insurance company has 
allowed such a policy said nels carlson a lloyds underwriter 
union members held hostage at least 12 hours would be paid a sum 
equal to half their annual salary in the case of death or injury 
the insurance benefit paid to the guard or his family would be twice 
the salary a new york prison guards average annual pay 27500 
its kind of like your life insurance where you hope it never 
gets paid out but it happens said hardy rauch director of 
standards and accreditation for the american correctional 
association in laurel md the concept is quite nice its an idea 
that could very easily be expanded to other states

the whole family helped out when dican 
hadjy kabakjian began moonlighting in his basement in 1924 
stretching his physics professors salary and riding the crest of a 
promising new cancer treatment 
kabakjian was a great man and a brilliant scientist said one 
neighbor in the middleclass suburb of towering trees stately old 
houses quiet deadend streets and back yards big enough for great 
games of hideandgoseek 
the business in the basement of the threestory stuccoandframe 
victorian duplex helped get the kabakjians through the depression 
it also did something else it made theirs the only single 
residence on the governments list of the most toxic waste sites in 
america 
for two decades until kabakjian died in 1945 the family 
supplied doctors and hospitals with radiumtipped needles to insert 
near cancerous tumors 
id take the raw stuff and cook it until you get these radium 
crystals said kabakjians daughter alice kabakjian lewis 74 
her sister louise would weigh the crushed crystals and pack them 
into platinum needles the physicists sons armen and raymond worked 
during vacations dicranouhi kabakjian helped her husband when she 
wasnt keeping his house daughter lillian kept the books 
there was no fear of radiation then far from it two decades 
after it was discovered radium was hailed as a miracle treatment 
for everything from cancer to tonsilitis it would be years before 
scientists learned that radium decays into radon gas that can cause 
cancer the disease may not show up for 40 years 
someone living in the house 16 hours a day for their whole life 
stood a oneinthree chance of cancer said victor janosik who is 
managing the cleanup for the us environmental protection agency 
raymond kabakjian died at 65 of abdominal cancer in 1977 his 
son raymond jr died of bladder cancer in 1983 at age 37 william 
dooner who delivered radium died in 1984 at age 71 of cancer of 
the head and lungs 
dican kabakjian didnt develop cancer he died in 1945 at 70 of 
emphysema probably caused by fumes from the acid he used to process 
the radium ore 
the tallant family bought the house in 1949 and lived there until 
moving into a bigger place in 1961 anna tallant died of breast 
cancer in 1969 at 54 
the hot house came to light in 1962 during a search for 
forgotten radium sites in 1964 authorities spent 200000 to 
decontaminate it they declared success after removing furniture 
dishes rugs and clothing and after replacing windows walls sinks 
and a concrete basement floor that september the couple who owned 
it harry and mary kizirian moved back in 
but in 1983 during a survey of sites that might be eligible for 
federal cleanup assistance the epa found radon levels in the 
basement 10 times higher than allowable and gamma radiation similar 
to xrays 3 times higher 
in 1985 the house was put on the epas superfund list 
last august whitesuited workers equipped with oxygen masks 
vacuums and geiger counters arrived they dismantled the house board 
by board and brick by brick all but 1 bricks had been contaminated 
with radium 
the trees where neighborhood children played were uprooted 
squirrels had scampered up them carrying radioactivity from the 
ground where kabakjian dumped workshop waste the yard was dug up 
too leaving a 9footdeep pit 
about 240 feet of sewer line running down the street is 
contaminated and will have to be replaced none of the surrounding 
houses have been found to be contaminated but six lots showed 
higherthannormal radioactivity pushing the cleanup cost from 75 
million to 95 million 
i dont feel a great deal of anxiety about radiation said 
georgianna gretzenberg the back door of the house she and her 
husband bought in 1987 is 20 to 30 yards from the chainlink fence 
that surrounds the empty lot and from the trailers where workers are 
checked for contamination the freestanding garage they planned to 
turn into a studio may be lost to the cleanup 
its sad to see the neighborhood ripped up for me its more 
that said mrs gretzenberg who had a healthy baby boy six months 
ago my biggest concern is they wont finish i hope it will be 
done so we can go back to doing what you do in suburbia 
helen click who has lived behind the house for 23 years said 
we were told as long as its not in our house we shouldnt be 
concerned 
richard kizirian whose family bought the house from the 
tallants wonders if the radium can be blamed for illnesses that 
afflicted his family including sores that developed on his fathers 
legs before he died 
thats the 64 question our understanding is the longterm 
effects of radiation have not been proven said kizirian he has 
considered suing but isnt sure who to sue and lawyers say hes 
lucky the epa paid for the cleanup 
the costs included 140000 paid to the kizirians and the 
basehore family who lived in the other side of the duplex the 
families retain ownership of the land which will be filled and 
landscaped when the work is done this summer 
kizirian said that given its history he doubts anyone will buy 
so he and the other heirs to his parents estate might donate it to 
the town 
nancy basehore who is in her 70s declined to talk at length 
about her experiences but considers kabakjian to be a great man 
she hasnt decided what to do when the property can be occupied 
again either 
once the epa finishes theyll certify they dont have a 
radiation problem said george bochanski a borough councilman and 
former environmental protection agency spokesman thats more than 
some of us can say 
penny flaherty who rents the house next door grew vegetables 
the summer of 1987 but kabakjians legacy worried her it was 
funny i grew them and brought them in but i had qualms about 
eating them and threw them out

after reaching the 11th grade keith gordon 
dropped out of school so when at the age of 27 he had a chance to 
direct his first movie the chocolate war he drew upon a very 
different kind of education 
gordon who had acted in dressed to kill and all that 
jazz among other films remembered his conversations with such 
directors as brian depalma and john carpenter 
that was film school working with those people he said i 
think theres no medium thats more immediate its just beginning 
to be scratched 
depalma body double the untouchables directed gordon 
in dressed to kill and home movies 
brians really a brilliant stylist gordon said he really 
took the time to explain to me why he picked a certain lens 
that was brians contribution 
and from carpenter christine gordon took some pointers on 
how to keep a film crew happy 
carpenter showed me how a set should be run john never yells 
his theory is life is short and if were not going to have a good 
time you might as well pack and go home 
the turning point for gordon came 20 years ago when he saw 
stanley kubricks sciencefiction classic 2001 a space odyssey 
i thought ok thats what im doing i was haunted by it 
had nightmares by it i started going to offbeat things foreign 
films i found myself obsessed by stories that didnt have neat 
answers that made me question things 
gordon worked in the film library at the museum of modern art 
going through the museums archives and began appearing in school 
plays but by the time he was in high school he was ready to move 
on 
i never did well with rules said the director just 16 when 
he left school 
his professional acting career had already begun the year before 
when he joined the national playwrights conference at the eugene 
oneill theatre he worked in stage television and films over the 
next few years but dreamed of being on the other side of the camera 
it was always in my heart to direct gordon said to be 
honest i thought i would be 45 or 50 not 27 
the chocolate war is based on robert cormiers bestselling 
novel which gives a lurid account of life at a catholic school in 
washington gordon recalling his own unhappy experiences in school 
was attracted to the issues dealt with in the book 
i carried this book around in my head for 10 years i wondered 
if stuff in the book was unrealistically harsh or vicious but i met 
people who had been sexually molested and repeatedly beaten up 
stuff where your mouth is hanging open 
for years the book was passed around all the major studios but 
when the rights finally became available gordon quickly snapped 
them up and persuaded jonathan krane an independent producer to 
back the project 
the crew was young my cinematographer was only a few years 
older than me said gordon who completed filming in just 24 
shooting days for a cost of 700000 
the chocolate war stars john glover as the sadistic brother 
leon wally ward as the ruthless leader of a student gang and ilan 
mitchellsmith as a freshman caught up the schools vicious 
atmosphere 
following the example of carpenter gordon made sure the crew 
working on a limited budget was properly appreciated 
im almost proudest that we had a great time almost everybody 
who worked on that film said he never had more fun on that kind of 
money youd be better be sure that they have a good time any 
director that doesnt avail himself of the talent around him is a 
fool 
he was tested early in the project one day after shooting for 
15 hours gordon could sense that the natives were restless 
i made a speech bought pizzas and shook everybodys hands i 
made sure they were heard i made the producer give everybody an 
extra 100 for such a long day 
when filming was over gordon gave himself high marks for his 
performance on the set 
i was surprised how much fun it was i expected to be more 
miserable more panic struck he said i discovered im pretty 
good in panic situations parking tickets i get nervous breakdowns 
but on the set i was very clearheaded 
gordon seems unlikely to drop out of the film world 
ultimately youre realizing your own vision he said its 
collaborative but also very personal film involves literature 
music acting and lighting its a wonderful chance to stretch 
yourself in every direction at once

in a basement along the tiber river a roman catholic 
priest is poring over thousands of dusty wormeaten books in a 
project to preserve precious remnants of jewish culture in italy 
the collection of some 20000 books manuscripts and magazines 
helps document the vitality of what may be the oldest jewish 
community in the west with its roots believed to predate the 
christian era 
but like other remnants such as ancient synagogues and 
catacombs much of the written record has deteriorated or been 
shipped to israel for safekeeping 
now however through a combination of grants a nobel 
prizewinners contribution and volunteer work by the rev pier 
francesco fumagalli the books will be cataloged restored and made 
available to the public in the new national jewish library and 
heritage center when it opens in rome within a year or so 
as long as there are jews in italy they are entitled to their 
heritage said tullia zevi the driving force behind the project 
mrs zevi is president of the union of italian jewish 
communities which represents the countrys 40000 jews 
having successfully pressed for a turnover of the jewish 
catacombs from vatican to italian government jurisdiction five years 
ago she next set her sights on placing collections of jewish books 
from around italy under one roof in rome 
unable to afford a lay library expert she turned to fumagalli 
one of italys leading judaic scholars who worked for eight years at 
the 400yearold ambrosiano library in milan he is a member of the 
vaticans commission for relations with judaism 
he spends monday afternoons working with four jewish university 
students in the basement of romes jewish school to cataloge the 
books stacked in metal cabinets and protected from further decay by 
a humidifier 
several thousand are in very bad shape with their bindings worn 
off pages yellowed and damaged by worms 
its a mutually enriching experience he said noting that 
the jewish press in italy dates to the late 1400s 
culture is a measure of the vitality of a people 
he said italys jewish press was the oldest in europe a jewish 
press began in spain about the same time as italys but closed down 
when jews were expelled by spains catholic rulers in 1492 
about 80 percent of the books in italy are in hebrew many of 
those from the collection of the rabbinical college in rome 
others have come from siena florence ferrara pisa and such 
towns as pitigliano near viterbo where there are no longer any 
jews 
in addition to prayer books and books on jewish history and 
customs there are publications and documents put out by the various 
communities that provide a glimpse of jewish life in italy through 
the centuries 
the government provided 460000 for restoration of the library 
site a former mechanics workshop about 50 yards from the school 
and facing the monumental ochrecolored main synagogue across the 
tiber 
rita levimontalcini the italianamerican scientist who is 
jewish contributed what mrs zevi called a slice of the 
145000 cash prize that came with winning the nobel prize for 
medicine in 1986 the money allows the community to pay the students 
about 300 a month for their work with the library 
olivetti the business machine company donated a computer for 
the book cataloging 
the jewish presence in rome is believed to date back 2000 years 
its history was heavily conditioned by the papacy in 1555 pope 
paul iv confined romes jews to a ghetto that stood until papal rule 
ended in rome in 1870 
but according to mrs zevi jews lost faith in italy only after 
the enactment of the racial laws by benito mussolinis fascist 
dictatorship in 1938 which foreshadowed deportions to nazi death 
camps 
more than 8000 jews were deported and only around 900 returned 
mrs zevi said many of those who emigrated on their own never 
came back while those who survived shipped valuable items to israel 
but attitudes appear to be changing italian jews were heartened 
by the broad support from politicians at a recent convention 
examining the damage done by mussolinis racial laws 
by the same token italian towns have shown an interest in 
restoring synagogues and other jewish remnants 
this is a 99 percent catholic country mrs zevi said it 
prides itself on being pluralistic we are the ones who can supply 
the pluralism

two and a half years ago 60000 
people lived in milange then a lively place with night clubs and 
shops and prospering from a large tea estate 
but then mozambiques guerrilla war came to milange and today 
only 5000 remain the others fled to safety in malawi just two 
miles away the night clubs and shops are heavily damaged the tea 
estate razed grass pokes through potholes in the wide avenues 
the destruction was wrought by the guerrillas who are trying to 
overthrow the southern african countrys marxist government they 
occupied milange in september 1986 government forces drove them 
into the bush last june 
now government troops are supervising the reconstruction of the 
town in northern mozambiques fertile zambezia province 
but reconstruction is slow the rebels control much of the bush 
isolating milange and leaving it dependent on international aid 
brought in from malawi 
a school and clinic have been rebuilt but only three teachers 
are available for 1500 children in the school and one medical 
assistant with scarcely any medicines runs the clinic 
the mozambique department of agriculture has begun rehabilitating 
the tea estate it plans to bring equipment from other teagrowing 
regions and envisions some 500 workers reviving production that is 
so vital to the towns economy 
the united nations high commission for refugees is distributing 
seeds for cassava groundnuts peanuts and maize corn to 
encourage mozambican refugees in malawi to return to their abandoned 
homes 
an estimated 640000 mozambicans have fled into malawi in recent 
years because of food shortages and the war between the government 
and the mozambique national resistance known by its portuguese 
acronoym renamo 
the guerrillas took up arms in 1977 in an attempt to install a 
prowestern government in mozambique a portuguese colony until 
independence in 1975 
the refugees in malawi are among an estimated 12 million 
mozambicans who have taken refuge in neighboring countries but aid 
officials say those in malawi are slowly starting to return home 
with 500 leaving in december many headed for milange 
one recently returned refugee said he fled to malawi when he 
heard the rebels were coming 
those who stayed were beaten and the women young or old 
were raped said the father of five who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity i have come home because i feel safe with the 
frelimo government soldiers and i want to plant my fields 
little effort has been made to rebuild milanges derelict town 
center instead poeple have built grass huts on the edge of their 
fields around the town 
a bulldozer lent by aid donors is clearing an airstrip for 
light planes to bring relief supplies 
milange is gradually coming back but defense from rebel attacks 
is still a main concern 
we will liquidate the armed bandits and construct freedom and 
progress says a government poster on the wall of milanges vacant 
hotel

kleinbooi matsegeng is a 
typical black south african businessman his premises are the 
sidewalk and hes spent much of his 15 years as a street vendor 
trying to dodge the police 
now times are good matsegeng obtained a license in 1987 and 
sells an array of goods in a zone where vendors can operate freely 
he is able to pay four helpers with income that has risen tenfold 
since he began peddling paper bags in 1974 
matsegeng and entrepreneurs like him personify the booming 
informal sector of south africas economy hundreds of 
thousands of blacks who work for themselves outside the more 
structured whitedominated realm of paychecks job applications and 
tax forms 
no one knows the exact scope of the informal sector but experts 
believe it represents perhaps onefourth of the countrys economic 
activity and provides a living for at least a million blacks 
president pw botha has acknowledged the informal sectors role 
in creating jobs last year he presented three mobile hotdog 
stands to street vendors in pretoria and sampled stew at a sidewalk 
stall 
street vendors known in south africa as hawkers peddle 
everything from hair spray to handcrafts sausages to sunglasses 
recently they have begun to work collectively to increase their 
economic influence 
about 16000 hawkers and owners of spaza shops small 
unlicensed grocery stores operated inside homes in black townships 
have joined the african council of hawkers and informal businesses 
the council was founded in 1986 by lawrence mavundla 30 a 
former shop steward for the national union of mineworkers who was 
fired from a gold mine during a 1985 strike later that year he saw 
some hawkers being chased by police and decided to form an 
organization to represent their interests 
one old woman who could not run fast enough was caught her 
goods destroyed and she was thrown in the back of a van he 
recalled i thought this should not happen to people who are 
trying to make an honest living 
the council financed by membership dues of 10 rand 4 a month 
has a staff of 17 it campigns to ease licensing restrictions 
provides legal aid to hawkers who face fines and negotiates with 
businesses in hopes they will become more supportive of hawking 
hawkers are regulated by local authorities and many of the 700 
municipal governments maintain bans or tough restrictions but 
mavundlas council has helped achieve major reforms in johannesburg 
the largest city 
hawkers now can obtain licenses in two days rather than six 
months he said leading to an increase of licensed hawkers from 250 
a few years ago to 9600 now 
johannesburg recently opened its central business district to 
hawkers after years of exclusion and has created free hawking 
zones where traders like matsegeng can operate 
the city has scrapped requirements that hawkers have storage 
facilities and advertise in newspapers in order to qualify for a 
license 
now johannesburgs hawkers can operate as close as 100 yards 
from a store selling similar goods in contrast to 400 yards before 
they can stay in one place for two hours before they had to move 
every 20 minutes 
the established business community is our biggest problem 
mavundla said in an interview retailers see hawkers as a threat 
a pressure group coming to take their customers away 
they need to see theres a benefit for themselves he added 
the more competition there is the more business there will be we 
can provide jobs and help the economy grow 
the councils ultimate aim is give more economic power to blacks 
and to help poor uneducated people provide for themselves in a 
society where 5 million whites dominate 26 million blacks 
economically as well as politically 
economics is going to succeed where politics have failed to 
find solutions said mavundla 
the councils publicity director vicky sussens said hawkers are 
receiving increasing cooperation from wholesalers and manufacturers 
even though they fear reprisals from retailers 
she added that wholesalers and manufacturers realize their future 
is selling to blacks 
there is more respect now they see hawkers as businessmen not 
just someone trying to eke out a living like a beggar 
successful hawkers such as matsegeng can earn 1200 rand 500 a 
month double the wages of a typical black mineworker those 
operating out of houses often earn even more 
police harassment of hawkers has declined but remains a problem 
said mavundla he said hawkers commonly spend 60 rand 25 a week 
bribing policemen to avoid fines or confiscation of goods either of 
which can wipe out a weeks earnings 
government leaders praise the informal sector but theyre only 
saying it for political gain mavundla said theyre not really 
serious 
louise tager a law professor who has studied the informal 
sector says it is flourishing because of restrictions on formal 
black business development in townships such as lack of approved 
sites and bans on using homes as business 
its existence is evidence that no legislation however harsh 
can totally extinguish the entreprenurial spirit she wrote

ask freshman rep ben jones how he feels about 
the 51 percent congressional pay raise and hell tell you to read 
his lips then hell twist them into contortions defying translation 
jones the tv actorturnedgeorgia politician demonstrated that 
evasion technique at a blacktie dinner the other night it was 
comedy with a message 
the 101st congress is in a political and parliamentary maze on 
pay an issue that has nagged senators and representatives since the 
first 
while he backed this raise president bush said that in a perfect 
world the members of congress would vote on salaries instead of 
operating under a system of raises by remote control that vision of 
perfection is not widely shared at the capitol 
for 200 years setting pay has been a headache for members who 
fear voter retribution for approving their own raises for the last 
20 the senate and house have sought political shelter in a system 
designed to spare them votes on their own salaries 
using one of the besttested of political hedges congress turned 
the pay dilemma over to a commission that usually means getting 
somebody else to cope with a highrisk issue preferably somebody 
who doesnt have to run for reelection 
that process was supposed to make congress a spectator when 
salary commissions proposed pay increases for house and senate the 
federal courts and the top tier of the executive branch the 
president can accept reject or modify before sending the pay 
recommendation on to congress which gets the raise unless both 
houses vote no within 30 days 
that sounded foolproof it isnt 
it led to intramural bickering at the capitol since the senate 
often has had free politicallypopular votes against pay raises 
that took effect anyhow for lack of house rejection that seemed to 
be happening again but the game plan came apart in the house 
because of widespread public opposition to the 45500 raise the 
commission recommended 
congressional pay is a readymade issue for an election 
challenger who if elected comes to see the need for higher 
salaries in a new light 
that instinct showed when republicans tried to use yet another 
whopping pay increase as a 1989 fundraising issue but they had to 
drop it because president reagan recommended the raise and president 
bush endorsed it both coupling support with a ban on the 
speechmaking fees many members have used to supplement their pay 
the pay commission said the increase is needed to restore a 35 
percent drop in the spending power of congressional judicial and 
top executive branch salaries during the past 20 years debate 
seldom centers on the merits of an increase although the size of 
this one has made it particularly vulnerable to voter wrath 
congress has tried again and again to find a system that would 
calm the salary issue there have been proposals to turn the issue 
over to a permanent independent panel even to have the supreme 
court set congressional salaries 
nor is there new business in the call for reform as the price of 
a pay raise president ford said his endorsement of a 1977 raise was 
based on a firm commitment to a new code of conduct that was to 
have included a ban on moneymaking speeches the raise took effect 
without the ban 
one salary commission called the whole business a prolonged 
adventure in futility prolonged indeed the first congress in 
1789 got 6 a day that was raised to 1500 a year in 1816 
stirring a voter rebellion that ousted incumbents including daniel 
webster that led to repeal and an 8 daily wage 
when the bill of rights was proposed so was a constitutional 
amendment forbidding any congress from raising its pay until after 
the next election it never was ratified the assumption was that 
house and senate would vote on their salaries and that their 
constituents would be the final judges 
now the sytem avoids pay votes 
lloyd cutler chairman of the salary commission said thats the 
way it should be in advocating a raise without a direct vote 
cutler a washington lawyer and former democratic white house 
counsel said utility infielders who bat 200 are being paid more 
than judges and members of congress 
some are but they do have to risk going to bat

a posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago 
for emperors awaits president and mrs bush when they come to china 
feb 25 the guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs 
20000 a night for regular guests 
an electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main 
bedroom 
the diaoyutai state guesthouse stands almost as a contradiction 
to the austerity of todays china 
yes we are socialist explains sun guotong one of the 
officials who run the place but for heads of state you must have 
such things 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union will stay 
there when he visits in may so will prince charles and princess 
diana when they come in november 
the 26room guesthouse on the complex simply called no 18 was 
remodeled for queen elizabeth ii when she visited beijing in 1986 
the chinese government pays the bill for official and state 
guests such as these but others have to come up with 20000 a 
night 
diaoyutai which means fishing terrace sits on 100 acres of 
pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond 
the complex is made up of 15 large guest villas no 18 is the 
most sumptuous 
from its goldplated bathroom fixtures and silkcovered walls to 
its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne the villa 
radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby gray city where 
egalitarianism so lately was in style 
but ideology seems to stop at the gates to diaoyutai even during 
the extreme leftist cultural revolution of 196676 chairman mao 
tsetungs wife jiang qing relaxed in villa no 17 by watching 
western movies 
chinas shifting foreign policy can be charted however from the 
guest list in 1959 when the separate villas were built most of 
the guests were communist comrades 
now director cheng shaoliang said most guests are americans and 
japanese 
the vietnamese revolutionary ho chi minh soviet leader nikita s 
khrushchev president francois mitterrand of france and presidents 
richard m nixon jimmy carter and ronald reagan were among the 
parade of world leaders who stayed at diaoyutai 
other hotels in beijing may be more convenient guests can 
come and go more freely cheng said in a recent interview but 
we offer quiet and security they cant match 
diaoyutais telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls 
to guests if the caller doesnt know their room number the police 
who stand at attention at the compounds gates admit only cars whose 
license plates have been cleared in advance 
for the guests however almost anything is possible cheng tells 
a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the 
winter when they were out of season the guesthouse sent peoples 
liberation army soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and 
try to find some he said 
now we wouldnt do that cheng said but almost diaoyutai 
sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has 
special ingredients flown in from all over the country 
it pays 1000 yuan 270 a pound for a rare herb necessary for a 
special scallop soup 
hotels wont do that cheng said 
with that kind of overhead rates start surprisingly low at 140 
a night for a standard room presidential suites cost 500 a night 
but the fanciest villas no 12 and no 18 must be rented in 
their entirety for 20000 a night 
among other recent users of no 18 were prime minister rajiv 
gandhi of india and armand hammer the american industrialist 
prince charles and princess diana are booked for nov 1 
no 18s presidential suite includes separate hisandher 
bedrooms and bathrooms each thickly carpeted and decorated with 
costly art works 
he gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath 
she gets a sunken tub with brass rails 
to help cover its annual 28millionyuan 75million budget 
diaoyutai began selectively accepting nonvip tourists and 
businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign 
businessmen last year 
but nonvips need connections to get a room reservation 
people cant come in off the street said sun guotong 
chengs deputy 
the club with a 40000 membership fee also is intended only 
for the leading people sun said 
if a lot of people come the air is not so fresh he added 
while walking through the deserted exercise room threelane bowling 
alley and billiards room the indoor swimming pool is only four feet 
deep very safe for visiting leaders sun said 
he paused in front of a green feltcovered table used for playing 
the chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to 
reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new 
game 
mahjong in china is practically synonymous with gambling which 
is illegal do guests gamble 
i dont know sun said diplomatically

his role models are the rev martin 
luther king jr and bishop oscar romero of el salvador two 
assassinated civil rights activists 
he nearly followed them full circle in september when attackers 
opened fire on his car killing his bodyguarddriver and wounding 
his adopted son 
the rev andres giron a 42yearold roman catholic priest 
hasnt stopped what hes been doing pressing for land reform and 
seeking permission from the vatican to run for president of this 
central american country 
but that doesnt mean he is fearless 
im afraid he said sometimes i think its better to be a 
live burro than a dead thoroughbred 
giron a useducated priest who taught in the slums of memphis 
tenn in the 1960s and marched with martin luther king in the 
citys garbage workers strike continues to pursue land reform even 
though it can be mortally dangerous to do so 
his father and four other relatives were among the estimated 
100000 people killed in political violence during the late 1970s 
and early 1980s local and international human rights groups blame 
government security forces for the vast majority of the killings 
the slaughter of suspected leftists quelled a stubborn decadesold 
insurgency though pockets of guerrilla activity remain 
giron spent 198183 in the united states because of threats on 
his life here 
in guatemala land is the source of power no land no power 
he said in an interview beneath an almond tree next to his church in 
tiquisate 55 miles southwest of guatemala city 
two bodyguards one with a submachinegun and the other cradling 
a shotgun leaned against the priests car nearby giron had just 
said mass for about 200 parishioners among them eight adolescent 
girls dressed in white lace and finery for their first communion 
he told them in the homily that his christian duty and theirs 
included denouncing the terrible things going on in this country 
that officials are stealing that the army is killing people 
he exhorted them to act as yeast in the firgurative bread of 
society to contribute to a rising up 
giron has enlivened a political scene already focused on 1990 
presidential elections 
he said he intends to use the national campesino association he 
formed in 1986 as the base for a political party the party will 
challenge the centrist christian democrats and rightists who have 
dominated partisan politics since the return to civilian government 
in 1986 
the peasant organization represents 120000 people he said 
ultraconservatives who with the armed forces ran the country 
throughout its modern history consider giron a subversive some 
have called for his arrest 
this country needs a spark to ignite a revolution and i want 
to be part of that revolution he said 
the priest calculates that 71 percent of guatemalas arable land 
is owned by 1 percent of its population others dispute that figure 
but there is agreement that land distribution is among the most 
skewed in the hemisphere favoring a small group at the expense of 
poor indian peasants who make up nearly 60 percent of the population 
according to the us agency for international development 
usaid enough uncultivated land is available on big estates to 
provide fiveacre plots to each of the estimated 500000 heads of 
peasant households with no land at all 
challenging the gentrys hold on land has always been dangerous 
president jacobo arbenz began the countrys first and only land 
reform in the early 1950s and his initiative galvanized rightist 
opposition military officers supported by the us central 
intelligency agency overthrew arbenz in 1954 and returned all 
expropriated holdings to their previous owners among them the 
usbased united fruit co 
usaid subsequently described arbenzs reform plan as moderate 
and progressive 
giron does not have a detailed plan yet for redistributing land 
but he describes his philosophy as radical he envisions a guatemala 
with no landless peasants a place where country people have enough 
land to grow the food they need 
it cant be done in one year or even two because people have 
to be educated but i would make a real revolution here and they 
the landholders know it said giron 
giron who supported the successful presidenical candidacy of 
vinicio cerezo in the 1985 election said he has letters from the 
president in which the christian democrat committed himself to land 
reform 
cerezo has made no such commitment publicly but he has supported 
programs to aid small farmers he also has used government funds to 
buy about 11000 acres of land to divide among some 3000 peasant 
families 
all that has been done has been done very timidly said 
giron who with some followers invaded and occupied fallow farmland 
in 1986 the government bought the parcel and sold it to the 
peasants at subsidized prices 
girons campesino association runs three cooperative farms on 
such land bought cheaply from the government 
he said cerezo probably would have pursued smallscale 
redistribution had it not been for a coup attempt last may 
the military high command backed cerezos government and put the 
rebellion down but the civilian administration which had been 
barely able to assert authority against the military in the best of 
times became even more conditioned by and dependent upon military 
tutelage 
may was it for vinicio said giron 
rightists contend that breaking up large holdings would hurt 
production of hard currencyearning mainstays of the economy 
coffee sugar bananas and cotton 
even in good export years people are dying of hunger 
responds giron im not in favor of destroying the productive 
apparatus im smart enough to know we cant live without dollars 
but i cant go along with a system under which a small group of 
the privileged live like kings while most people live like beggars 
some have suggested giron harbors a death wish 
how can they say i want to be martyred he said its a 
risk but its a risk im willing to take but that doesnt mean i 
want to die 
what the hell he added switching from spanish to the 
colloquial english he picked up in memphis i dont want to die i 
wanna live

only 52 of 500 or so soldiers accused 
of trying to overthrow president corazon aquinos government have 
been convicted so far despite her vow to punish them to the fullest 
that the law allows 
military records indicate 108 have been acquitted 
sources close to the judge advocate generals office predict most 
of the accused will either be acquitted or receive light sentences 
unless mrs aquino applies pressure on the military justice system 
military courts have charged at least 488 officers and enlisted 
men with involvement in six coup attempts since mrs aquino took 
power in an uprising against president ferdinand e marcos in 
february 1986 
no reliable figures are available on the actual number of 
soldiers involved in the coup attempts including a mutiny aug 28 
1987 when at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded 
but military officials say at least 2000 mutineers took part 
that last and the most serious attempted coup hundreds more were 
involved in five others 
many lowerranking enlisted men were quietly released without 
charge because they were simply following orders others escaped 
including former lt col gregorio gringo honasan who led the 
mutiny in august 1987 
so far the stiffest sentence 12 years at hard labor was 
given to col oscar canlas leader of the takeover of a private 
television station in manila in january 1987 
although the sentence called for hard labor sources close to the 
military say canlas who was convicted last may is being held in 
relative comfort with access to tennis courts and other amenities 
at a military garrison pending completion of a review of his 
conviction 
in december 41 soldiers were acquitted of taking part in an 
attack in april 1987 on fort bonifacio headquarters of the 
philippine army the military said they were freed because of lack 
of witnesses although sources said prosecutors had sworn statements 
from witnesses linking most of them to the attack 
the acquittals have led to charges in the philippine press of a 
military whitewash in a recent editorial the independent 
philippine daily inquirer said the acquittals reflect an esprit de 
corps in the military that assumes the form of a closed club 
the members of which in each others eyes can do no wrong 
a western diplomat with links to the philippine military said he 
suspects the courts will go easy on defendants to avoid worsening 
factionalism in the 160000member armed forces 
i dont think anyone will be put up against the wall said 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity there may be a 
few who get punished but i suspect most will get off lightly in the 
spirit of national reconciliation 
a military lawyer also insisting on anonymity acknowledged that 
personal ties and the brotherhood of arms often influence 
courtmartial boards which are trying the soldiers 
before we write our decision on that piece of paper our 
conscience asks us can you live with this can you live with the 
thought that you sentenced a guy to be killed a guy in your same 
uniform and the establishment he said 
then my heart tells me do this he gave a thumbs up sign 
for acquittal 
in such an atmosphere military lawyers say it will take pressure 
from the aquino administration to overcome widespread sentiment for 
acquittals or light sentences 
another military lawyer also speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the military justice system had become accustomed to 
presidential pressure during the 20year marcos administration 
he said that during some major trials in the 1970s marcos 
himself would monitor proceedings via closedcircuit television and 
telephone prosecutors with detailed instructions on arguing the 
cases 
thats not done now anymore the lawyer said but if they 
in the aquino government want these guys convicted they will have 
to orchestrate it give us directives

its vino novello italys version of 
frances beaujolias nouveau and it has proved a boon to a wine 
industry that had been in the doldrums 
the new wine was the idea of piero antinori the nobleman and 
wine baron and another producer in 1975 when a flood of lowgrade 
chianti had customers turning up their noses at the rustic 
strawcovered red wine flasks 
the two producers came up dressedup variation of chianti called 
vino novello ready for drinking just about six weeks after 
harvesting 
today the wine is booming with production in 1988 estimated 30 
million bottles the italian wine industry is looking at novello and 
other young wines as a way out of the crisis brought on by quality 
problems a tainting scandal and declining demand 
its been an immense success said antinori his gray eyes 
twinkling as he sipped a glass of novello in the 16thcentury 
antinori palace in florence i was really surprised 
italy is the worlds largest wine producer and its citizens have 
a long tradition of washing down hearty meals with equally hearty 
amounts of wine 
but in recent years domestic consumption has plunged from 99 
quarts percapita in 1977 to 63 quarts in 1986 according to 
statistics of the european economic community 
officials say a similar drop is occurring throughout the 
mediterranean as people in busy industrial centers abandon long 
lunches 
the basic customs have changed shrugs ezio rivella managing 
director of villa banfi wines the worker used to do peasant work 
ate badly and drank wine for energy to work that doesnt exist 
anymore 
but thats not all italians are increasingly gulping soft drinks 
and beer or simply cutting back on wine in the interest of their 
diets 
i even drank mineral water at lunch today rivella said 
the change in demand has battered italian winemakers whose 
incomes are also suffering from a worldwide wine glut and a methanol 
poisoning scandal in 1986 that crippled italian exports 
in an effort to appeal to a more affluent society winemakers 
have come up with a river of new offerings such as novello fragrant 
whites sparkling wines and fruity reds 
people now want wines that are lighter and fresher says 
antonella abeti of the novello wine institute a regulatory body 
even in the land of pasta she says people just arent eating 
heavy anymore 
since antinori and another company gaja began making novello in 
1975 129 other italian wineries have followed suit most in the 
past two years 
sales of vino novello in 1987 the lastest year for which figures 
are available reached 19 million according to the vicenza fair of 
novello producers an average bottle costs the equivalent of about 
4 in italy 
italians have long produced a harvest wine but until the french 
introduced sophisticated equipment for fermenting young wines three 
decades ago italian novello was somewhat bitter and did not travel 
well 
it took the publicitydriven success of french beaujolais nouveau 
to persuade the italians to start massproducing their own novello 
like beaujolais nouveau novello not only is ready to drink in 
about six weeks it is made by putting whole grapes into oxygenfree 
vats where the fruit releases carbon dioxide that in turn breaks 
down the grapes to produce a fresh fragrant wine 
but italian novello is drier and tarter than beaujolais nouveau 
because of a greater variety of grapes and the addition of some 
traditionally fermented wine 
vino novello represents an important development said 
antinori whose family has made wine since the 14th century 
but its not even so much in income it has perhaps changed 
some of the image of young wines its also been a help for regions 
that have had an image problem 
one of those regions was tuscany the home of chianti in the 
late 1960s and 1970s the quality of much chianti declined as small 
grape plots were supplanted by large estates that planted highyield 
grapes 
producers hope that the young wines that have helped revive their 
own image will now open up foreign markets 
while still the largest exporter of wine to the united states and 
other large nations italy has seen its exports drop from 520 
million gallons in 1982 to 312 million gallons in 1987 according to 
the most recent government figures 
much of the drop stemmed from the methanol scandal which killed 
two dozen people another factor was the increasing sophistication 
of consumers who turned away from the inexpensive fizzy wines italy 
traditionally exported 
what part novello will play in helping italy recoup its foreign 
market is still unclear it is more expensive than beaujolais 
nouveau and there is neither strict government regulation of how the 
wine is made nor preparations for a major foreign advertising 
campaign 
the reality of italian novello wine is becoming stronger and 
stronger antinori said but theres one handicap novello is an 
italian reality it hasnt yet crossed the borders

director of the allegheny county industrial development authority 
were changing from gray to green essentially were looking at 
open space clean light industrial development and some heavier 
activity 
from 1979 to 1987 more than 67000 jobs in basic steel and 63000 
jobs in heavy manufacturing were lost in the pittsburgh area 
companies closed within days sometimes overnight leaving behind 
eerie ghost townlike plants where coats still hung on hooks and 
lunch boxes waited to be opened 
while social service agencies tried to help the displaced 
workers planners turned their attention to the shuttered plants 
themselves 
in particular they looked at mills in the monongahela valley 
south of pittsburgh the cradle of americas steel industry for 
psychological and economic reasons they believed the change had to 
begin there or the valley so dependent on steel for so many 
decades would wither 
around the end of the 70s and the early 80s we were 
experiencing a major shutdown every week barrouk says the 
magnitude was such that it was almost impossible to respond in any 
way you thought was adequate 
there were a lot of major facilities in private corporate 
hands and the companies were not interested in being landlords 
public and private entrepreneurs with a vision stepped in 
although theres no general longterm plan for the region a quiet 
renaissance in real estate has emerged some examples 
just six miles from downtown pittsburgh usx corps centuryold 
homestead works is being turned into a new alloy of light 
manufacturing plants offices and a riverfront playground with water 
slides a boardwalk and a sandy beach 
within five minutes of downtown pittsburgh the former jampl steel 
corps hazelwood plant is becoming the citys version of 
californias silicon valley bulldozers have cleared the way for the 
pittsburgh technology center a site for developing robots computer 
programs and research into biotechnology 
in glassport about 10 miles southeast of pittsburgh the former 
copperweld corp wire manufacturing plant is the home of 14 
companies producing windows ball bearings steel rods and 
futuristic airbuses 
in neighboring mckeesport and duquesne usx corp last year 
turned its national and duquesne works over to barrouks agency in 
what is believed to be the nations largest transfer of industrial 
property to local governmental agencies for redevelopment 
at an international conference on urban renewal a team of 
experts led by britains prince charles descended upon the valley 
last year to examine ways to revitalize the area in general their 
ideas validated what some private and public developers already had 
planned or begun 
not everyone has been receptive 
those who believe basic steel can bounce back say demolishing 
plants such as homestead is akin to hammering the last nail in the 
coffin of the nations oldfashioned integrated mills and the 
communities that became dependent on them 
in many cases these facilities were horrendously managed 
says bob erickson of the steel valley authority which is trying to 
maintain steelmaking in the mon valley 
with leaner smaller operations that can respond more quickly to 
changes in the market some doomed plants still could be producing 
steel profitably erickson says in some cases steel is even being 
manufactured on a limited scale at plants that are being demolished 
such as aliquippa 
others however point to study after study that have determined 
that steelmaking at many of the facilities is no longer feasible 
the future for the sites they say is to offer a more diverse mix 
of goods and services 
were going to get jobs back barrouk says but instead of 
one manufacturer that has a club of influence on a community were 
talking about dozens of manufacturers 
erickson questions whether such sites are truly marketable 
theyre unattractive he says they have high taxes poor 
access bad public service and bad school systems the locations 
arent conducive to light industry or high technology without a lot 
of work being done 
kelly park whose company is developing the homestead works 
acknowledges it will take millions of dollars to clean the sites of 
pollutants and build roads bridges and sewer and water lines but 
he says once the stage is set there will be plenty of interested 
actors

you take 100 acres in the mon valley and put in sewer and water 
lines and it will fill up says park vice president of the 
clevelandbased park corp 
for the past year giant shears have been nibbling away at andrew 
carnegies citadel of steel and smoke in homestead slowly 
demolishing the plant that once employed 15000 and supplied massive 
amounts of armor plate in world war ii 
the park corp which liquidates and recycles industrial 
property bought most of the 3milelong plant from usx for more 
than 275 million kennywood park an amusement park bought the 
rest 
if this development happens as we anticipate i can imagine 
streets here with names like open hearth avenue park says this 
is going to be a real showplace with heavy and light manufacturing 
and some commercial and recreational ventures 
a brick building that was the site of the bloody 1892 labor 
dispute pitting carnegies pinkerton guards against striking 
steelworkers a battle that set the unionization of steel workers 
back 50 years may be preserved as an historic landmark 
a communitybased credit union plans to construct a 1 million 
building on a former parking lot 
park also may restart two mills within the plant and a local 
investment group is trying to buy part of the plant and produce 
steel for use in farm equipment cars and major appliances 
at one end of the site bulldozers are clearing brush and debris 
and regrading land for the water park scheduled to open this july 
kennywood president carl hughes says the park is the brainchild 
of an associate who felt that pittsburgh nearly 400 miles from the 
ocean needed a beach 
not only was the homestead property available but it has a 
gentle slope and offers a view across the river of a densely wooded 
hillside 
i think people are going to be astounded when they see this 
hughes says its such a sylvan setting its almost impossible to 
imagine its an old steel mill 
hughes says the park will feature 18 water slides a boardwalk 
wading pool and a channel for floaters this in the midst of a 
roughandtumble town known more for its food banks and soup 
kitchens than recreation 
if its successful he plans to build a large marina and floating 
restaurant 
a few miles upstream glassports fortunes sank with heavy 
manufacturing and in the mid80s when the county bought 
copperwelds vacant glassport plant the economic climate for 
startup companies didnt appear too bright 
when we walked through the plant it was the eeriest feeling 
because the papers were still on the desks jackets were still hung 
on hooks lunch boxes werent even opened barrouk says people 
were given oneday notice when they left that place it was like a 
neutron bomb it was just like walking through a ghost town 
using public funds the county and an incubator group bought the 
1milelong facility in 1984 for 600000 and spent 25 million to 
renovate it 
officials hoped they could find tenants within five years it 
took less than two 
the site houses 13 companies employing about 200 people most of 
whom were hired locally and the county is considering buying 
adjacent property 
the activity has pumped some life into glassport itself says ron 
stuart who manages the facility 
where the restaurants were closed before people now have 
lunch riteaid is putting in a brand new drugstore down the street 
the first new building glassport has seen since hitler was a 
corporal he says 
heady with glassports success the county last november bought 
two landmark steel mills usx corps national works in mckeesport 
and its sister plant the duquesne works across the river 
the 360acre package cost the county 36 million which wont be 
paid until the land is redeveloped and sold 
barrouk estimates the cost of redevelopment could reach 40 
million 
in pittsburgh the jones amp laughlin steel mill once a symbol of 
the citys grimy past is perhaps one of the best examples of the 
citys clean new future 
in 1983 the city and county bought 52 acres for 4 million and 
in conjunction with the university of pittsburgh and carnegie mellon 
university are redeveloping it to make room for the pittsburgh 
technology center a hightech industrial park 
a master plan adopted last year calls for each university o 
develop a portion within six to seven years 
we took a calculated gamble says evans stoddard of the 
citys urban redevelopment authority 
stoddard says the high cost of developing the land more than 
500000 an acre necessitated public financing 
theres no private developer in the world thats going to do 
that he says the only way that can be done is with substantial 
subsidy 
stoddard is convinced such ventures are necessary for areas like 
pittsburgh and the mon valley to prosper into the next century 
theres a sense of urgency on everyones part that we have to 
get started with this economic transformation and prepare for the 
next century he says we cant look back

editors note can cancer cells be altered by chemicals to 
behave more like normal cells and thus become less lethal some 
researchers think thats a possibility and recent experiments have 
been encouraging weve got gold here said one if we can 
mine it appropriately and exploit it 
</TEXT>

early experiments with cancer patients are 
showing tantalizing results for an unusual therapy rather than 
killing cancer cells it seeks to mature them into less recklesse body 
by prodding cancerous cells out of their immature state of wild 
reproduction and toward a more normal specialized form the 
treatment aims to sto 
denizens of thp the uncontrolled growth that characterizes 
cancer 
researchers hope that approach will let them attack cancer cells 
that resist current drugs and reduce the serious side effects of 
chemotherapy 
big obstacles remain before differentiation therapy could 
become part of standard treatment scientists say but even 
observers not involved in the recent human trials in europe asia 
and the united states say they see reason for hope 
as a basic idea itsappear anyway 
apart from issues of therapy scientists are looking for help 
from basic research better drugs may result if researchers can 
define just what signals trigger differentiation in normal and 
cancerous cells 
one target for study is oncogenes malfunctioning versions of 
some normal genes which turn a cell cancerous another possibility 
has been discovered only recently suppressor genes or 
antioncogenes which appear to inhibit the transformation to cancer 
international collaborations of scientists and physicians are now 
studying differentiation factors and the cooperation should shorten 
the time needed to develop the potential says waxman who helps 
organize annual meetings of differentiation researchers 
despite the unanswered questions researchers say they believe 
differentiation drugs may one day play a significant part in the 
battle against cancer 
weve got gold here sartorelli says if we can mine it 
appropriately and exploit it

editors note after his first book about a sensational murder 
case joe mcginniss was deluged with letters from people wanting him 
to look into other killings most of the letters he didnt read but 
he did read one that led him to write blind faith for 
mcginniss there will be no more books about murders 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
joe mcginniss says his new book blind faith 
is the last one he will write about a murder case hes running out 
of empathy 
i think my capacity for empathy is over there is nothing worse 
than a writer not feeling as sorry as he should for the people who 
are hurting says mcginniss author of the bestselling fatal 
vision about jeffrey macdonald a green beret officer convicted 
of killing his pregnant wife and two small children 
blind faith examines the case of a toms river nj 
insurance salesman robert o marshall deeply in debt from gambling 
losses and enamored of the town jezebel 
so marshall decides to hire a hit man to kill his wife the 
beautiful maria as he always called her collect the 15 million 
in life insurance he had bought for her then convince his three 
teenage sons that they too could learn to love their new 
mother 
the book already bought as a miniseries is a compelling yarn 
that involves hints of corruption in new jersey two imported hit 
men from louisiana forged insurance policies and a town that within 
24 hours after the murder turns its back on a pillar of the 
community a leader in the country club set chairman of united way 
it was just the opposite of the macdonald case mcginniss 
says all of macdonalds friends rallied around convinced he was 
innocent 
the macdonald case proved a legal nightmare for mcginniss 
macdonald sued and mcginniss agreed to pay 325000 in an 
outofcourt settlement however following complicated litigation 
macdonald collected only 50000 for himself plus 92000 in legal 
fees a judge ordered that some of the money should go to the mother 
of his murdered wife as well as macdonalds mother 
mcginniss maintains that he too believed the green beret 
innocent until he started to examine the evidence he then 
concluded and let his book reflect that macdonald was indeed the 
man who wiped out his family 
except for the principals mcginniss uses pseudonyms in blind 
faith for the other characters although the real names are all 
part of the public record 
considered an ideal couple with three blond sons the marshalls 
were teasingly called ken and barbie by their friends 
mcginniss says he sort of stumbled onto the book when a toms 
river woman a stranger to him wrote him a long letter shortly 
after the murder 
she had about 90 percent of it right two months after the 
murder he says the letter was very compelling 
mcginniss says he doesnt know why he even read the letter after 
fatal vision went on the air in 1984 as a twopart miniseries 
he was deluged with letters from people asking him to write a book 
about some murder or the other 
i got hundreds of letters from people whose second cousin was 
murdered or from someone who was beaten up in a barroom brawl and 
they wanted me to write a book about it he says i was just 
throwing them away 
what first interested me about the marshall case was what kind 
of a place was this where a guy who had lived there 20 years this 
pillar of the community was automatically presumed guilty by his 
friends within 24 hours of the murder 
i was also interested in doing something about the social mores 
of a town in the 80s particularly a town that didnt have any kind 
of distinctive identity it seemed to be a town transformed by 
materialism 
it was also a book about these three boys and how they coped 
when they learned their mother truly beloved by them was dead and 
then they heard their father is a suspect and then they see him 
convicted 
mcginniss first book the selling of the president became a 
best seller 20 years ago when he was 26 the book chronicled how 
richard nixon defeated the late hubert h humphrey 
the difference between illusion and reality has always been a 
theme of mine mcginniss says here the illusion was good 
housekeeping come to life maria bought that whole ideal that she 
was an ornament attached to the husband that her job was to give 
them a happy home for that she paid with her life 
for the children 13 16 and 17 at the time of the murder it 
was a fairytale life of mustangs and jeeps swim meets and country 
club lunches with mom and dad 
this is not a story about their father mcginniss says im 
not interested in exploring the recesses of his mind like i was with 
macdonald im interested in the story of how these kids grappled 
with the worst sort of shock there was a monster under their bed 
and it was their father and they had to look him in the eye and not 
blink it stripped them of every illusion they ever had 
the youngest boy john still does not believe his father is 
guilty

<TEXT>
when i talked to them john was still desperately clinging like 
a little boy lost at sea to the only thing he had left mcginniss 
says 
the other two chris and roby believe their father had their 
mother killed a mother who put notes in their lunches always 
kissed them goodbye and fixed them pancakes for breakfast even when 
they got up at 11 am she was super mom they will not answer their 
fathers letters nor speak to him 
they feel their father is already dead says mcginniss 
the father is on death row in trenton nj awaiting the outcome 
of appeals he still proclaims his innocence clinging to a story 
that he pulled into a secluded rest stop on the jersey state parkway 
to check on a leaking tire and someone hit him over the head and 
then shot maria leaving two bullet holes so close you could cover 
them with a 50cent coin marshall claims he was robbed of his 
atlantic city winnings and then staggered onto the highway to get 
help 
the tire which was slashed after it was parked showed no 
evidence of a slow leak and there were brightly lit places within a 
few miles he could have stopped 
then there was the mistress he planned to marry he had bought 
yet another life insurance policy this one for 100000 that very 
day marias signature had been forged on various documents to raise 
cash 
prosecutors presented evidence linking him to the louisiana hired 
guns one of them was granted immunity to testify the other 
accused of being the actual shooter was acquitted by the jury that 
found marshall guilty another man who acted as gobetween during 
the negotiations received a life sentence for conspiracy to commit 
murder 
mcginniss hints in the book that the prosecutors office could 
have taken another tack which would have involved more people but 
he wont say much more about it 
if i wanted to write a book about organized crime in new 
jersey i could have but i think it would have been less 
interesting than what these boys are going through he says 
political corruption is everywhere what is unique is the 
situation these three kids find themselves in their love has kept 
them very close even though they all viewed the case differently at 
first 
chris was the first to feel his father was guilty roby was next 
spurred on by a jail house call in which his father asked him to lie 
the next day on the witness stand roby would not do it 
the children received some of the insurance money as the heirs 
and will receive more roby is moving to california to help with the 
miniseries based on the book 
although this was another murder it was completely different 
from fatal vision mcginniss says the town of toms river was 
sort of a metaphor for the blind faith we all have in the american 
dream but how thin is that veneer how much of what passes for 
social intercourse in america is sheer hypocrisy toms river is a 
good example of this superficialty of cocktail and dinner parties 
and country clubs where everybody finds it necessary to stay on top 
i didnt feel like i was repeating myself 
mcginniss says his next book will be about sen edward m 
kennedy the man he has been negotiating with kennedy but does not 
yet know whether kennedy will cooperate with him 
i want to do this because i have no sense of what it must be 
like to have had this extraordinary life of being the little 
brother and having everything handed to you and then become the 
family spokesman mcginniss says this will not be a book about 
chappaquiddick it will be about the man and his life 
after the selling of the president mcginniss tried his hand 
at a novel the dream team not one of his great successes but 
he says he will do another novel some day 
he wrote heroes in 1975 and lived in alaska for one year to 
write going to extremes published in 1980 he has also taught 
fiction and nonfiction writing at bennington college 
mcginniss and his wife nancy doherty live in a small town in 
western massachusetts and have two children he also has three 
children from a previous marriage

editors note there was a time when louisianas cajuns were 
spanked at school if they spoke french all that has changed in a 
resurgence of pride in cajun culture a culture that is celebrated 
in the rendezvous des cajuns a twohour program of music and 
humor that is broadcast live every saturday night from a restored 
vaudeville theater no english is spoken there 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the footstomping and fiddling inside the old 
eunice vaudeville theater spoke of a packed house for the cajun 
version of prairie home companion 
they lined up around the block ignoring a tornado watch and 
gullywashing rain to purchase tickets for a show where no english 
was spoken except for brief opening remarks by a uniformed park 
ranger 
for more than a year now the crowds have been filling the 
700seat liberty theater every saturday night for a live twohour 
show broadcast locally regionally and at several points in the 
nation on a delayed basis 
the music the humor and the recitations of spicy recipes by 
guest chefs are in cajun french which is based on a language spoken 
in the 18th century 
the acadians were exiled from nova scotia by the british in 1755 
and 10 years later many had found their way to the swampy coasts and 
inland prairies of south louisiana others went to inland canada and 
maine 
the tape of this show is being sent to public radio in maine 
and new brunswick says mayor curtis joubert who led a local 
movement to save the threestory brick liberty theater from 
destruction once it finally closed as a movie house in 1982 
built in 1924 the liberty was the tiny towns chief window into 
a world filled with vaudeville comedians actors singers and 
ultimately the movies 
joubert a retired high school principal and veteran politician 
sweettalked the citizens into buying the building next he used 
his charms on the national park service which entered into a joint 
venture with eunice 
town residents helped restore the gaudy grandeur of the old 
theater tearing down rotted curtains that had covered original 
ceilingtofloor murals one a painted carmen dancing with a 
tambourine moldings were regilded chandeliers cleaned and floors 
scrubbed of more than 50 years of accumulated wax and dirt 
revealing sparkling greenandwhite ceramicpieced floors 
an old organ with wooden pipes now valued by the historical 
organ society at 25000 was found under a pile of debris 
the theater is part of the jean lafitte national park which is a 
series of places scattered around south louisiana including the new 
orleans french quarter 
construction was set to begin earlier this month on a 3 million 
acadian culture center adjacent to the theater it is scheduled to 
open sometime next year 
the jean lafitte national park chose the liberty theater as a 
site for an interpretive center for the prairie cajun culture the 
city signed a cooperative agreement with the national park service 
which uses the theater for its living history presentations 
that the city of eunice is now the site for a national park 
boggles the minds of many of the people in this rural area 
joubert says 
also a stateoftheart sound system is being installed that 
will allow larger radio stations to air the program 
they demand quality sound and well have it joubert says 
the heart of the liberty is the rendezvous des cajuns which 
features cajun bands from the famous to youngsters just getting 
started on the traditional sound that was isolated along with the 
french heritage until the late 1960s 
in my generation we were spanked at school if we spoke 
french recalls joubert there was a sense of shame in being 
cajun we kept the music to ourselves 
in less than 20 years the state has brought back that heritage 
with a bang offering french courses in elementary schools with many 
teachers from france chefs have traveled the world touting the food 
no one represents the new wave of cajun culture better than dr 
barry ancelet the 37yearold humorist who hosts the show boasts 
joubert 
ancelet is a specialist in folklore at the university of 
southwestern louisiana and did his doctoral dissertation on cajun 
humor 
i would die in english because the tone of voice the melody 
and the vocal pattern are so important in humor ancelet says 
the humor here is not the slick johnny carson type its more 
earthy and rural theres a lot of hunting and fishing stories and 
here they poke fun at prominent people in the community 
when the show started in the summer of 1987 ancelet says he was 
pleasantly surprised to find that the 20 percent to 25 percent of 
the audience who didnt speak the language were laughing 
well get someone in from wyoming or tennessee who will nudge 
the fellow next to him and ask what i said the cajun must be 
interpreting well because the tourist laughs theyll get into a 
conversation get to know each other theres a twofold victory 
here the tourist gets his moneys worth he came down here to see 
cajun culture in the liberty he talks with them dances with them 
the cajun sees that his native knowledge is thereby valued he feels 
good about himself 
ancelet says he sees the show as an extension of his classroom 
i call it guerrilla academics i have the opportunity to talk 
to 700 people and while they are being entertained i get to slip 
information to them about who they are where they came from why 
they are the way they are 
the show stirs some of the younger people especially musicians 
to learn the french language 
the musicians are learning that its not just enough to mouth 
french words ancelet says they need to understand what the 
words mean to make the song live 
a local committee whose members identities are kept secret to 
avoid pressure chooses the bands for each show from a long list of 
applicants 
the committee tries to encourage new talent and yet bring in 
the wellknown bands from time to time the mayor says well 
never run out of musicians 
until the liberty theater opened the younger generation didnt 
get much opportunity to hear cajun music because the bands were 
performing in nightclubs he says 
weve been portrayed so many times as a bunch of drunks falling 
off horses at mardi gras he says heres a soft drink and 
popcorn crowd on saturday night a familyoriented crowd enjoying 
life and the good things we have to offer in acadiana

editors note the committee that chose the new president of 
brown university was looking for someone with a record of academic 
excellence says the head of the panel and it wouldnt hurt if 
they could also raise money and walk on water the man they chose 
was vartan gregorian a veteran educator with a flair for healing 
ailing budgets 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
vartan gregorian is an ebullient armenian 
who rejuvenated the new york public library in a flurry of fund 
raising brown university is a 224yearold ivy league institution 
with dwindling donations and an iconoclastic curriculum 
brown with an enrollment of 7000 has a 370 million endowment 
the lowest among ivy league colleges massachusetts harvard 
university by comparison has a 3 billion endowment 
gregorian who will be inaugurated as browns 16th president on 
april 9 is a curlyhaired roundfaced workaholic who rescued the 
new york library from a financial crisis by raising nearly 500 
million in his seven years there 
ive always favored the underdog says gregorian 54 brown 
has always had to do more with less 
gregorian who took over the duties of former president howard r 
swearer on jan 1 has 22 years experience as a teacher and as a 
provost at the university of pennsylvania but he acknowledges that 
his fundraising ability was not held against him 
brown now in the final year of a threeyear fundraising drive 
saw gifts drop from 513 million in 198687 to 351 million in 
198788 according to samuel babbit vice president for development 
while he may become involved in fundraising gregorian says his 
primary obligation will be to the academic welfare of the 
institution 
its the educational challenge that has brought me here he 
says 
brown was one of the first major colleges in the turbulent 1960s 
to do away with most general requirements today its one of the 
last to resist returning to the more traditional program of core 
courses 
gregorian who holds a doctorate in history and humanities from 
stanford university is concerned with the overspecialization among 
students at many colleges 
he wants college not only to give students training but to 
give them an education not just an education but to instill them 
with culture with breadth of scope so they can adapt in these 
difficult times to a fastchanging world 
curriculum is not a frozen document gregorian says he plans 
to study records for the full 19 years of the new curriculum 
before deciding if he will change its direction 
browns success is the flexibility of its curriculum as it 
enables students to respond to their needs he says this 
onedimensional or narrow professionalism reduces peoples 
intellectual curiosity and brings a narrow range 
we must teach people how to cope not with success alone but 
with adversity and failure out of failure and adversity there is a 
lot you learn 
gregorian knows of both he left the university of pennsylvania 
for the library in 1981 after being passed over for the universitys 
presidency 
a native of iran who was educated in beirut he says he missed 
academia during his time in new york 
one of the things i missed in the years at the library i 
didnt have time to read or write says gregorian the author of 
three books one of the tragedies is to sit on the mountain of 
knowledge and not have time to get to it 
gregorian who plans to teach a freshman course so he can set 
an example that teaching and leadership are not mutually 
exclusive says his first priority will be faculty recruitment 
nationally and internationally 
twothirds of the american professors will be retiring in the 
next 10 years he says 
while gregorian will focus on the faculty his reputation is with 
the students 
a faculty adviser to two dormitories at penn he often dined with 
the students he says he hopes to continue that practice at brown 
ill be getting to know the students whether theyd like to 
know me he jokes 
officials on the brown search committee which chose gregorian 
among 200 applicants looked for a scholareducator according to 
committee head martha nussbaum a philosophy professor 
we wanted to find someone who had experience doing research and 
a high level of excellence and it wouldnt hurt if they could also 
raise money and walk on water she says

jason suffers from aidsrelated complex or arc a disease that 
often precedes the fatal fullblown acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome at school he was isolated in a trailer next door to the 
classroom and his only real friend was a tattered doll named mick 
jasons story is similar to the plight of indianas ryan white 
an aids victim shunned at school and forced to leave town 
jason is the only student in the school trailer 
he has endured a lawsuit and a move from nearby granite city to 
this tiny southern illinois community in search of peace phone 
calls playing funeral music and taunts added to the scorn 
now his mother tammie father al and 10yearold sister 
melissa are picking up the pieces after a struggle that turned 
neighbor against neighbor in a battle over jasons future 
jason weighs only 46 pounds and stands about 4 feet tall his 
most striking features are his big brown eyes a quiet boy he 
answers most questions with few words 
i like good people jason says i like to go places 
when he grows up he says he wants to be a police officer 
jason was born with hemophilia a condition in which the blood 
fails to clot properly he also had stomach problems and a shortened 
esophagus problems that were corrected by surgery 
but he underwent hundreds of blood transfusions and at least one 
of them involved tainted blood products that brought the deadly aids 
virus into his body in march 1986 jason was diagnosed with arc 
that was the beginning now the family its former school 
district and neighbors wish they had done some things differently 
fearing he would endanger other children his mother pulled him 
from kindergarten in granite city and a district tutor taught him at 
home until november 1987 
thats when the robertsons and the school district agreed that 
jason should be taught in a special trailer 50 feet from regular 
classes 
jason started school 15 minutes before the other students every 
day and left 15 minutes later than they did he was not allowed on 
the playground 
school officials say they told mrs robertson that jason probably 
would be placed in regular classes at the school of 750 in the fall 
of 1988 because his health had improved 
but mrs robertson contends the district made the offer only 
after the american civil liberties union at her request filed a 
lawsuit on jasons behalf in april 
on may 5 a federal judge ordered jason back into regular 
classes but the ruling touched off protests from parents in granite 
city a steel town of 36800 across the mississippi river from st 
louis 
angry parents chanted back to the trailer upon his arrival 
drew callender 29 says he got into the fight because of anger 
and fear for his childrens safety i did say some foolish 
things he also founded an informal group of protesting parents 
called save the society against virus environment 
its a fear of not knowing he says 
mrs robertson says she got up to three telephone calls a day 
from protesters threatening her and jason people hurled epithets 
on the street home had become a war zone and i felt like i was 
dying inside she says

her former neighbors insist they never heard anyone harass the 
robertson family and they say the family had an unlisted phone 
number 
if she would have just kept her mouth shut instead of going and 
going and going she wouldnt have any problem says maggie 
rigsby 68 a former nextdoor neighbor of the robertsons 
she just couldnt stay out of the tv and the newspaper and it 
just made a mess she says i dont think people should be 
harassed but she asked for a lot of this stuff 
ms rigsby who lives with her 8yearold granddaughter says she 
would not want her to get near jason she opposed his entry into 
regular classes its too contagious and i dont know enough 
about it 
nobody harassed her in this neighborhood says alice perkins 
34 who lived next door to the family for nearly 10 years there 
was no vigilante group 
shes trying to write a book and she wants a grand finale about 
granite city im glad shes moved because someone else can have all 
this fun that we had 
with family permission the st louis postdispatch printed the 
phone number 
to protest state cuts in funding for hemophiliacs mrs robertson 
contacted two newspapers including the postdispatch and the 
familys life became public record 
i did not comprehend that it would be this big of an issue 
says mrs robertson maybe we made some mistakes i was doing what 
was best for my kids 
stu mills the granite city districts supervisor of special 
educational programs described her as volatile she often 
initiated confrontations but he said he had sympathy for any parent 
in mrs robertsons situation 
he said that the mother of an aids child thinks she has special 
license to say whatever she wants even characterizing one town as 
the good guys and the other the bad 
mrs robertson says the family decided to leave granite city 
after a man accosted her and hit her on the head with a stick 
they moved to south roxana a oil refinery town of 2300 nearby 
to the home where jasons father who manages a plastics company 
grew up it was a good move for jason 
he just smiles all over says sharon waters a teachers aide 
and registered nurse hired for jasons secondgrade room at the 
375student south roxana elementary school 
his little eyes just dance they talk more than he does she 
says i think hes happy just to see him play like when he gets 
the right answer he gets real excited 
at first she said jason didnt know how to deal with his 
classmates because he had had only limited contact with children 
his age for nearly two years but they encouraged him and in days he 
made friends 
south roxana principal dorothy stickels calls jason an average 
secondgrader in a class of 24 his writing has improved and he 
seldom misses school she said i see him every morning with his 
back pack and a smile on his face 
but the school lost eight students because of jasons attendance 
fear of aids again 
jasons mother says her new neighbors are quick to offer support 
they said we want you to stop running make this your home 
she said 
many of the new neighbors seem knowledgeable about aids which 
cripples the bodys defenses against disease and leaves the victim 
prey to infections and cancer it is both incurable and fatal but 
cannot be spread casually it can be passed on by contact with 
infected blood or by sexual contact 
jason doesnt talk often about his disease or his experience in 
granite city his mother says although his hurt has spilled over to 
the familys new life in south roxana once hurt he was crying and 
asked doesnt god know i am sick 
it hasnt been easy for jasons sister either frustrated and 
confused she needed counseling 
now jason feels more at home his kitchen poster ends with the 
words love may be the hardest thing to get

the rev bobby joe stuckey takes over his 
fathers television evengelism empire in hbos glory glory and 
is soon up to his halo in trouble just likewell some recent 
headlinemakers 
but richard thomas who stars as bobby joe insists that the 
script for the 3hour musical comedy was written long before jim 
and tammy bakker and jimmy swaggart became household names 
the scripts been around for a while says thomas 
bestremembered as john boy on the tv series the waltons we 
filmed it last summer in toronto it more or less started as an 
examination of the phenomenon of television evangelism 
the story originated in 1981 with coexecutive producer bonny 
dore who had worked briefly with evangelist oral roberts in 
polishing his broadcasts 
if i felt the film was taking cheap shots at someones faith i 
never would have done it thomas says at the center stuckey is a 
man of true faith but hes been seduced into straying he can speak 
for the importance of spirituality but all institutions are subject 
to compromise and corruption 
the movie directed by lindsay anderson the whales of 
august o lucky man will premiere on sunday 
bobby joe is a biblical scholar totally lacking in the star 
quality his father used to turn his little church into a television 
empire hes earnest but dull and the ratings start to tumble in 
desperation he turns to a downandout rock singer who becomes the 
charismatic sister ruth the ratings and the donations reach 
unprecedented levels with sister ruth 
but behind the altar unknown to bobby joe shes leading a life 
of sodom and gamorrah hes deeply in love with her and when it 
comes crashing down hes the candidate for a pillar of salt 
ellen greene stars as sister ruth winston rekert as an 
investigative reporter james whitmore as a church elder and barry 
morse as bobby joes father the rev dan stuckey 
when they called me they said the part was for a nice 
cleancut preacher thomas says some things you do because 
theyre radically different from what youve done before some you 
do because theyre familiar this was familiar but i liked the way 
it was written its satire without taking cheap shots 
he compromises himself with this woman and before he knows it 
hes trapped in a web of deceit and conspiracy 
in february thomas goes to the hartford stage in connecticut for 
peer gynt he will appear in a new translation of henrik ibsens 
sevenhour play which will be presented over two nights the 
sixweek run will keep him there until may 
i played hamlet there in 1987 thomas says thats 
shakespeares longest play and this is a thousand lines longer than 
hamlet many people consider the play to be ibsens masterpiece 
thomas spends much of his time teaching classes at colleges 
across the country 
and with any luck ill get another tv movie or two he 
says thats how it works out i dont have the most expensive 
habits a tv movie will take care of my expenses so i can do theater 
and teach then when im at home its a fulltime job for my wife 
and i to look after four kids 
thomas left the waltons in 1977 the immensely popular series 
that ran on cbs from 197281 was based on earl hamners 
reminiscences about his boyhood in virginia in 1977 
id love it if we had a reunion show thomas says but only 
earl could write it hes a sly fox with a deliciously wicked sense 
of humor hes as much a country bumpkin as donald trump 
as for another series thomas says he would certainly consider 
it but a series takes up so much of your time it would have to be 
something i absolutely loved he says i prefer plays but im 
an actor the material comes first if its right ill go anywhere 
and work in any medium 
i have been lucky as an actor ive always gotten work ive 
never had to wait by the phone too many actors regard the theater 
as some place you go to stretch as though it was an aerobics class 
or they say its their duty to go back as though it were an 
obligation like having tea with a maiden aunt when people see me in 
a film they see my work but when they see me on stage they see me 
work 
thomas recently observed 30 years as a professional actor he 
made his debut in 1958 at the age of 7 in sunrise at campobello 
he played the youngest of franklin roosevelts children john that 
same year he made his television debut in a christmas tree for 
the hallmark hall of fame

in a large unfinished room on the third 
floor of a downtown office tower a stocky intense man sits on a 
piano bench and stares at a cardboard stage setting 
three actors work their way through a scene as the man follows 
their movements he listens to their voices and checks their 
reactions to each other 
the scene is repeated again and again between repetitions the 
observer shadowed by an interpreter jumps up and walks over to the 
makeshift scenery to demonstrate what he wants 
director yuri yeremin who doesnt speak english is rehearsing 
an american cast which doesnt speak russian in a hit soviet play 
at the hartford stage company the rehearsal process which will 
last four weeks is slow but cordial its theatrical glasnost in 
the making a unique cultural collaboration made possible by the 
thaw in sovietamerican relations 
the hartford stage experiment occurred after its artistic 
director mark lamos traveled to the soviet union last year to direct 
a soviet production of eugene oneills desire under the elms at 
moscows pushkin drama theater which yeremin runs it was a first 
for an american director now yeremin has returned the favor 
the drama he is directing is alexander chervinskys the paper 
gramophone it is on view at the hartford stage through march 18 
before the recent liberalization of soviet life under mikhail 
gorbachev the play couldnt have been performed in the soviet union 
in its original version 
the paper gramophone which is set in the stalinist era of 
1948 deals with the awkward romance between a young girl and a 
naval cadet chervinskys play was written as a film script in 1980 
but never was produced because of its criticism of stalin 
with yeremins help chervinsky adapted the paper gramophone 
for the stage eight years ago it opened at the central academy 
theater of the soviet army in moscow but was closed quickly by 
soviet authorities 
changes were made in script and the play was allowed to reopen 
the press was so good that it is still running said yeremin 
speaking through an interpreter the paper gramophone remains in 
the repertory of the central academy theater where it is performed 
several times each month 
during those years of stagnation the theater was probably the 
only place where you could hear a word of truth yeremin says 
for the american version yeremin has rewritten the play again 
going back to the original screenplay he has also made it clearer 
for american audiences who arent familiar with the details of 
soviet life and politics 
yeremin found some details of american theater rehearsal and 
production different to say the least one he even found 
painful in the soviet union the artistic director of a theater 
rules he chooses the actors from his own company for specific 
roles there are no auditions 
on the one hand i like auditions a great deal because the 
director has more choice yeremin says you can look for what 
you really need on the other hand i think the theater is a family 
so there are other considerations not just whether the actors fit a 
given role but also that you speak the same language you have the 
same asthetic and the same creative outlook to me a production is 
always an ensemble in the soviet union it was easily solved 
because we have worked together for years 
that wasnt the case in hartford where yeremin chose two 
unknowns ann dowd and ray virta for the romantic leads he was 
pleased with the quality of the actors who auditioned and was 
particularly taken with miss dowd and virta who the director says 
looks very russian 
during the rehearsal session the director the actors the 
hartford stage production team and the theaters dramaturg greg 
leaming sit at a long table miss dowd virta and a third cast 
member kathleen chalfant go over another scene 
yeremin urges virta to improvise the actor complies 
embellishing a speech by the young man the director also tells the 
dramaturge different dialogue is needed to clarify a situation 
the script on this third day of rehearsal remains very fluid 
although he makes the final decision yeremin likes to have input 
from his actors and with the authors permission has them create 
their own dialogue 
i think it is very unfortunate that in many instances the actor 
is turned into nothing but a performer the director says its 
as if we are denying the actors the authorship of their creativity 
yeremin has even improvised with the work of one of the worlds 
greatest authors anton chekhov adapting his short story ward 
number six for the stage by allowing actors to improvise for 90 
minutes based on specific ideas and topics from the story 
yeremin feels the paper gramophone has universal appeal 
transcending its soviet origins and thats why he chose it for 
american audiences 
i found that in the fates of the people who inhabit this play 
there is much in common with people everywhere he says it is a 
story of first love great dreams and the tragic pressure of the 
time and the breaking through to other spiritual spaces shall we 
say the play is full of humor but next to the comedy theres 
tragedy 
the idea of an exchange of soviet and american directors evolved 
in 1986 when yeremin took over the puskin theater he thought it 
would be interesting to have an oneill play directed by an 
american through an organization called the theater international 
exchange service and its director edith markson he found lamos 
i never thought that soviet actors could come up with a 
production in four and a half weeks says yeremin referring to 
lamos 1988 production of oneill at the pushkin 
in the soviet union directors rehearse a lot longer yeremin 
says its an average of six months but sometimes longer depending 
on when the director thinks his production is ready for an audience 
at the pushkin theater where a season of three or four plays 
usually runs from about the middle of september until the end of 
may yeremin has just opened a production of possessed by camus 
based on the dostoyevsky novel when he returns to moscow he will 
continue rehearsals of his next production the gospel according 
to mikhail based on several chapters from the bulgakov novel 
the master and margarita 
i have no hobbies no other interests the 44yearold 
yeremin says directing is all that concerns me only theater 
everything that doesnt have anything to do with theater bores me to 
tears except life itself which is the food of what art is

an american inventor and wildlife 
researchers at kruger national park say they have achieved a major 
breakthrough in conservation an immunization system that can stop 
epidemics in freeranging animals 
the breakthrough is the biobullet a vaccine in a biodegradable 
projectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter it 
has been used for three years to immunize animals ranging from 
warthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped out 
species in the park a 7800squaremile reserve 
anthrax is endemic in the northern part of the park an area 
where 200 rare roan antelope roam before 1970 when the park began 
an inoculation program by firing disposable darts at the animals 
from the air severe outbreaks had affected most of the herd animals 
if we have another major outbreak we have a method now of 
controlling the epidemic said valerius de vos head of research 
at kruger i consider this a major breakthrough it will be 
used widely in the future 
how widely depends to some extent on politics while south 
africas wildlife management program is regarded as the best on the 
continent its experts seldom visit other african countries where 
similar problems exist black african governments restrict contact 
with south africa because of apartheid its system of racial 
separation 
its a pity de vos said the rest of africa needs us and 
we need them weve got expertise and we need interaction 
for instance the numbers of endangered black rhinos are 
increasing in south africa but declining elsewhere due to south 
african conservation efforts the white rhino was removed from the 
endangered category worldwide 
representatives of private wildlife groups sometimes come to 
south africa and exchanges take place by mail but many western 
universities wont send copies of research papers to krugers 
scientists 
gus mills the chief predator researcher made a tape recording 
of hyena territorial cries and plays it from a jeep at night 
all the hyena in the area come around to listen and we can 
count them he said ive sent my tape to kenya and now kenyan 
hyenas are listening to south african hyenas 
de vos said the airrifle that fires the biobullet can be 
locally produced but not the bullet itself he worries what 
sanctions could disrupt the immunization program 
there has been talk of banning shipments of fourwheel drive 
vehicles to south africa from japan because they have military 
potential 
thats going to affect us de vos said i dont know what 
were going to do but i guess we can keep going with twowheel 
drive vehicles 
in 1973 de vos and his team began inoculating large mammals by 
firing dartsyringes from the air disadvantages included large 
numbers of plastic darts left on the ground and the time and cost 
of manufacturing the syringes 
de vos found fred paul an inventor from white bear lake minn 
who had developed the biobullet and used it to vaccinate domestic 
livestock and wild bighorn sheep paul came to kruger park to assist 
the research which includingfiring differentsized bullets at 
varying velocities until the right size and shape were determined 
the bullet can be fired rapidly allowing marksmen to inoculate 
about 1500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy the material a 
cellulose polymer dissolves inside the animal releasing the 
vaccine 
vaccinating 1500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy is 
impressive to say the least thats a lot of animals said 
maurice lefranc director of the institute for wildlife research a 
branch of national wildlife federation in the united states 
the south african park lends itself to such an effort because it 
has wide open spaces and concentrations of animals lefranc said in 
vienna va 
the project illustrates the place that south african wildlife 
researchers have in the forefront of species preservation and the 
national park boards philosophy about when to let nature take its 
course and when man should intervene 
south africa has taken a real strong leadership in the 
preservation and conservation of their wildlife said dr werner 
heuschele an endangered species specialist at the san diego zoo in 
california some of their game parks are among the best managed in 
the world 
one researcher at kruger is capturing impala to find a cure for a 
humancaused stress disease that occurs when antelope are chased for 
long distances and caught in a net in the wild predators chase 
impalas only for short distances 
the main form of research at kruger is surveillance taking 
aerial photos of vegetation counting animals taking blood levels 
of elephants to see if car exhaust affects them the data is fed 
into computers to help determine what projects are needed in the 
park a fenced area the size of massachusetts 
roads affect the natural spread of fire so controlled fires are 
set deliberately fenced animals cannot migrate during drought so 
dams are built 
in the early 1970s wildebeest rapidly diminished a new fence 
around the park had cut off one herds traditional migration route 
and heavy rainfall encouraged long grass rather than the short 
grass the wildebeest like 
managers could have set fires to eliminate the tall grass 
instead they decided to kill off lions and hyenas who preyed on the 
wildebeest 
to prevent the need for such action in the future mills and his 
team spend two weeks at a time following lions cheetah and 
leopards to monitor their eating habits 
are they depressing the prey in large numbers or living in 
harmony with their environment mills says researchers want to 
know 
although anthrax and footandmouth disease are natural african 
diseases they are controlled because it would take 20 to 30 years 
for the herds to recover after an endemic 
drastic fluctuations in animal populations are part of nature 
but we cant afford that said de vos 
we cull shoot buffalo and elephant and sometimes hippo 
these are species that can outgrow the system the rest of the 
animals are controlled by the system drought predation disease 
all act as controls for the buffalo and elephant the main predator 
in the past was man we have taken man out of it so now were 
bringing man back in in a controlled way

scientists at kruger 
national park are recruiting tourists to help them track count and 
conserve the african wild dog the most endangered large carnivore 
on the continent 
the bigeared dogs have intricately patterned coats each one 
distinct enough so individual animals can be identified from 
photographs once scientists know how many wild dogs there are and 
how they move they will begin drawing up conservation plans 
south africas national parks board and the private endangered 
wildlife trust have started a contest to get tourists to take 
pictures of the animals and send the prints in with information on 
location pack size and number of young 
about 1000 photographs have been entered in the contest which 
began in january and runs through july 
the first prize is a free trip to a south african national park 
and the runnerup prizes are photo equipment 
we could drive through the park for a month and never see one 
wild dog but probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees 
them they stay close to the road and they are not scared of 
vehicles said gus mills head of predator research at the park 
he said he believes there are about 300 in the park the biggest 
group in africa others are in botswana zimbabwe zambia and parts 
of east africa 
they move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the 
park when that happens they get into trouble said mills 
since wild dog packs hunt by day and dont fear humans they are 
easy targets for farmers protecting their livestock mills said a 
farmer whose land borders the park recently shot 20 dogs 
people have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs its somewhat 
like the way the wolf is regarded in america mills said 
wild dogs travel in packs of up to 25 and need to kill three or 
four impala to feed their members 
only one female and male in each pack breed with the female 
producing 10 to 15 pups and all members helping to raise the litter

after a year of scientific debate 
archaeologists still cant figure out how to keep the sphinx from 
falling apart 
its been almost six months since workmen made emergency repairs 
and replaced a stone that fell feb 7 1988 from the crouching 
lions right shoulder 
but the experts cant decide what to do next 
scholars from egypt and around the world have given us good 
advice but not one has been able to come up with a sure way to save 
our wonderful sphinx said sayed tawfik egypts top 
archaeological official 
as chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization tawfik is 
caretaker of egypts enormous treasurehouse of the past 
in all the world theres only one sphinx like this he said 
we love him and dont want to do anything to injure him this is 
why we have an international panel studying where to go from here 
the sphinx with its wideeyed stare and smug expression has 
undergone the jabs and probes of restorers almost since anonymous 
artisans sculpted the halfman halfbeast 4600 years ago at the 
base of gizas pyramids plateau 
none of the intermittent remedies has been able to stop 
occasional rock falls 
major falls touch off political uproars in cairo 
a tumbling rock in 1982 cost the job of the antiquities chairman 
at that time 
last years rockfall brought the departure of ahmed kadry 
pressured out of office because of a vocal and highly public row 
with his boss farouk hosni the minister of culture tawfik was 
appointed to replace him in december 
such sensitivity illustrates the sphinxs monumental importance 
to the egyptians ancient egypt was a catworshiping country and 
the sphinx remains a very personal and popular cat 
at times mostly buried in desert sand at times not the sphinx 
has survived into the late 20th century as one of worlds bestknown 
relics although bruised and battered 
nobody knows how or why or when it lost its nose and pharaohs 
beard but they are the most obvious reminders of the unseen 
stresses at work 
tawfik said he believes the ancient stonemasons knew the sphinx 
wouldnt survive as long as the pyramids of giza which form a 
backdrop against the horizon 
some of the sphinxs building blocks are as strong as those of 
the pyramids he said but others especially in the neck shoulder 
and rear haunches are weaker 
perhaps they knew after 4000 years or so the sphinx couldnt 
survive any longer said tawfik an archaeology professor i 
think the sphinx is a decoration of giza plateau a unique one not 
a monument for eternity as were other monuments 
the first known effort to help the sphinx was 3400 years ago as 
recorded in stone the prince who would become pharaoh tuthmosis iv 
followed an order that came to him in a dream during a daytime nap 
to remove the sand from the sphinx he did so and as promised in 
the dream the sphinx repaid him by arranging for him to usurp the 
throne of egypt 
fourteen centuries later roman technicians performed emergency 
restorations at a time when the pyramids and the sphinx already were 
drawing tourists from around the mediterranean 
in modern times foreign and egyptian teams have had a go at 
stopping the decay applying mudpacks to remove salt clusters and 
injecting glue down its throat didnt work more drastic suggestions 
like reburying the monument in sand or encasing it in glass arise 
from time to time 
in the year since the stone fell experts from egypt germany 
italy france the united states and other countries have given 
advice on how to proceed 
egyptian geologists are studying rock samples specialists are 
monitoring desert winds that blast the sphinx pollution experts are 
studying the effects of dirty air water and soil technicians are 
testing the water table level on and near giza plateau checking 
whether subterranean water is causing salt to weaken the limestone 
even so the giza plateaus antiquities director zahi hawass 
remains optimistic 
i believe for the first time in its history we are able to save 
the sphinx hawass said explaining that advanced scientific 
findings in many fields are being applied to archaeological work 
but for the sphinx he said time is passing fast 
hes like a suffering old man who needs an operation but what 
kind when the rock fell last year it was kind of a red flag 
hawass said at that time the government appointed a committee to 
decide what to do were still meeting 
and it will continue to meet he said until it comes up with a 
plan that wont repeat the earlier restoration efforts that harmed 
the sphinx more than they helped

physical evidence 
 
hollywood in the late 1940s and early 50s offered a series of 
films in which the hardboiled detective sifted through unsavory 
characters and wandered a labyrinthine route to uncover the real 
perpetrator of a heinous crime 
the stars were usually humphrey bogart dick powell or robert 
mitchum the author was often raymond chandler or a chandler clone 
the plots were as interwoven as macrame in the big sleep 
howard hawks even accomplished a miracle a flashback within a 
flashback within a flashback 
physical evidence is an update of that genre but with a 1989 
touch the real protaganist is a woman lawyer the 
bogartpowellmitchum figure is a defrocked cop so ineffectual that 
he spends the final shootout flat on his back wounded 
jenny hudson theresa russell is a public defender who resents 
assignment of all the good cases to male lawyers she demands a 
headlined defendant a suspended police detective burt reynolds 
accused of murdering a shady night club owner 
everyone believes reynolds did it everyone except russell she 
leaps into the investigation putting herself at peril from the many 
desperate figures who had good reason to knock off the club owner 
she also finds herself torn between the slovenly but appealing 
reynolds and her stockbroker housemate ted mcginley 
you can take your pick of suspects kenneth welsh as a smooth 
mobster ray baker a cop on the take tom obrien the deceased 
mans unmourning son kay lenz perhaps a blackmail victim and more 
these films are usually more fun in the playing than in the 
payoff and physical evidence is no exception bill phillips 
script provides a climactic body count of six and no great surprises 
michael crichton generally associated with science fiction 
westworld coma directed the film with a fast pace and an 
eye for offbeat characters some of his observations are wry 
particularly the yuppie lifestyle of russell and mcginley 
the opening sequence is a corker a wouldbe suicide ends up 
dangling from a bridge with a corpse in his hands unfortunately 
that is the most exciting part of the movie 
reynolds has admitted that physical evidence represents a 
change of character for him he plays a not too lovable excop who 
has lost control of his life and his destiny he pulls it off in 
good style retaining the cynical wisecracks while exhibiting more 
character than he has since deliverance 
theresa russell impressive as the husband killer in black 
widow remains totally in charge of her role as the dedicated 
lawyer ned beatty plays the devious prosecutor in his usual style 
and the rest of the cast offer an intriguing gallery of nogoods 
the columbia pictures release was produced by martin ransohoff 
and is enhanced by a henry mancini score the rating is r for 
language and violence

mississippi burning 
 
in the summer of 1964 young men and women from around the nation 
poured into mississippi to take part in freedom summer a 
concerted effort to register black voters in the segregated state 
one was 20yearold andrew goodman a student at queens college on 
june 21 goodman and two members of core congress of racial 
equality michael schwerner and james chaney drove to the town of 
lawndale where a black church had been burned they never returned 
they were stopped for speeding near philadelphia and jailed for 
several hours on bogus charges after being released that night the 
workers failed to call in after an extensive search involving the 
fbi and 200 sailors and a tip from a mr x the bodies were 
discovered aug 4 on a farm outside of philadelphia 
a fictionalized account of the murder of those three young 
volunteers is unraveled in alan parkers mississippi burning 
the movie is by no means an accurate or riveting account of that 
strange and horrendous period in american history rather it is a 
detective story that boils down to the typical hollywood good 
copbad cop treatment it is male bonding redux 
parker focuses on two fbi agents sent to mississippi to 
investigate the disappearance of the civil rights workers ward 
willem dafoe is the upstanding neatly suited partner who plays 
things by the book anderson gene hackman is a redneck and a 
maverick he does things his way and has a short fuse 
their search and andersons seething tensions are relentless 
through plot twists that suspend belief they discover the bodies 
and peel away the facade of white southern virtue exposing it as an 
ugly oozing canker sore parker almost has his audience cheering 
for the wonderful fbi bring back efrem zimbalist jr canonize j 
edgar hoover 
but the reality is that the fbi was more a harassment to blacks 
and sympathetic whites during the civil rights struggle than heroic 
knight the movie also overlooks those who were at the very helm of 
the movement and who led and suffered through that summer blacks 
are mere pimples on the landscape in parkers thinking they stand 
by and do nothing they have no passions no aggressions no 
thoughts 
the strength of mississippi burning is not its shallow look 
at segregation but its performances especially by hackman his 
portrayal of anderson is perhaps the best in his career he 
steamrolls through the movie with volcanic force filling the 
theater with a crackling tension dafoe is by necessity the 
antithesis and he delivers well 
taken as a detective film mississippi burning the fbi file 
name for the case is a fine piece of entertainment but dont 
expect a credible history lesson 
the orion pictures release was produced by frederick zollo and 
robert f colesberry the movie is rated r

horse feathers mca home video vhsbeta 2995 no rating 
 
even in this era of glasnost horse feathers proves that marx 
still reigns supreme marx a la groucho harpo chico and zeppo 
marxism according to minnies boys was always more akin to 
anarchism of course starting with the title of this 1932 classic 
which naturally bears no relationship whatsoever to the films 
goingson 
horse feathers takes us to huxley college a school so 
desperate for a winning football season that it names professor 
quincy adams wagstaff as its president the good professor played 
by groucho quickly spells out his program for the schools revival 
in one of the funniest musical bits ever filmed 
i dont know what they have to say 
it makes no difference anyway 
whatever it is im against it 
no matter what it is or who commencd it 
im against it 
as with all marx brothers movies it gives away nothing to say 
that insanity prevails huxley whips the bad guys on the football 
field and groucho harpo and chico commit trigamy with the campus 
femme fatale known as the college widow 
for trivia collectors said widow is played by thelma todd a 
comedian who in real life died a violent underworldrelated death 
three years after this movie was made 
with the madcap sj perelman as scriptwriter along with bert 
kalmer and harry ruby horse feathers was destined to be one of 
the funniest marx brothers films which is to say one of the 
funniest by anyone at anytime it easily ranks with the marxs 
monkey business and duck soup 
groucho always at the center of the antics is perhaps a little 
nastier than usual and thats just how we like it watch his scene 
in the canoe for example wooeing the comely todd with his guitar 
enough said horse feathers is 69 minutes of nonstop 
hilarity

reach for the sky atlantic ratt 
quiet riot pasha quiet riot 
 
why is it that guys in heavy metal bands always have permed hair 
maybe its the decibels of sound they crank out of their guitars or 
maybe its just to get a little variety in their lives 
because there sure isnt much variety in the music 
of these two heavy metal bands ratts effort is the more 
imaginative the band actually uses horns and a harmonica on one 
bluesy tune way cool jr and quiet riot with a revamped 
lineup is the more poporiented im fallin is actually kind 
of bouncy 
but otherwise the music and lyrics follow the wellworn 
tyrannosauruslike heavy metal footsteps on both reach for the 
sky and quiet riot 
theres the loud foursquare thumpthumpthumpthump of the bass 
and drums the themes of sex domination misogyny partyin and 
wonderin why that evil woman up and left theres the guitar solos 
always guitar solos reaching ever new levels of speed and 
showing off the soloists digital dexterity and the high scratchy 
vocals from the studlead singers over it all 
no deviation is allowed from the heavy metal form and ratt and 
quiet riot dont dare take a chance 
while they sing about being the king of the hill quiet

in her first two american films italianborn 
valeria golino has had a dizzying contrast of lovers peewee herman 
and tom cruise 
first came peewees big top in which she played the circus 
aerialist who wins the heart of the little guy in the tight suit 
the comedy didnt exactly overload the nations box offices but her 
next film did in rain man the seasons reigning boxoffice 
champ she is cruises secretary and bedmate 
golino 22 is unexpectedly modest about her work in rain man 
i am proud to be in the movie but i am not in it very much 
the dark beauty said but that is good the relation is between 
the two of them cruise and dustin hoffman thats what the movie 
is about the relationship of two brothers if i was there all the 
time i would have been in an awkward position or i would have had 
to be arguing with cruise all the time so i had to leave 
golino worked in the los angeles scenes as well as the locations 
in cincinnati and las vegas but she missed the middle portion in 
oklahoma 
there was something about cincinnati that i liked the people 
the architecture she commented las vegas it was fun but two 
weeks and a half in caesars palace was too much there is something 
about the sound that gets you you go in the rooms and youre like 
in a cage there are things on the windows to keep people from 
jumping out but you can have fun 
valeria golinos ascent to stardom appears to have resulted from 
a series of happy accidents 
i started as a model in rome when i was 14 or 15 she said 
i was not planning to be an actress then i met director lina 
wertmuller and she said you are going to be in this movie it 
was not an easy thing for me to work with someone like lina who is 
a wild woman for the first time it was kind of shocking 
i said i thought this was glamour and this is hell she was 
very tough to me she is very affectionate also very severe but 
after the first movie i decided this was what i wanted to do 
she appeared in 11 italian films earning the venice film 
festivals golden lion for love story the producers of big 
top peewee saw one of her films and brought her to hollywood for 
a screen test 
when i came here i didnt know who peewee herman was or 
randal kleiser the director she recalled in the beginning i 
didnt want to do the movie i had never done comedy before 
then i saw peewees first movie and there was something about 
him that made me say i can do this there was something about the 
way he moved his character that was so different so original i 
said thats not going to be police academy its going to be a 
comedy 
how did she land rain man 
in the most traditional way possible my agent called me and 
said there is a movie with tom cruise and dustin hoffman i said 
what he said the role is written for an american girl now 
theyre not sure lets give it a try 
the actress made a good impression on the casting director she 
read scenes twice for the director barry levinson then with tom 
cruise having finished big top peewee she flew home to rome 
then was asked to return to read once more with cruise then with 
cruise and hoffman 
ive never done so much reading for such a small role she 
said the script was rewritten to accommodate her accent since 
cruise imported italian cars she could logically be his 
secretaryinterpreter 
how was working with cruise 
it was much more interesting than i imagined she said for 
the first moment i met him i understood that this guy was great he 
wasnt like anything i thought before always we have big prejudice 
when someone has big success he must be an unbearable human being 
so i found myself in front of a nice in the most full meaning of 
the word really nice guy a gentleman 
and hoffman 
unfortunately the only thing i got to work with him on was in 
the elevator where she tries to teach him to dance it was a 
delicate scene to do because it could have looked very easily like 
seduction it was a naive way of trying to make him happy because 
his date hadnt arrived 
dustin like deniro is one of the totems of films even though 
i had a small role it was worth it to be around him to see how he 
moved how he reacted to me it was like going to acting school 
golino who speaks english as well as greek french and her 
native italian recently completed torrents of spring with 
timothy hutton even though she is now in demand she doesnt plan 
to settle in hollywood 
i like to work here but i wouldnt want to live here she 
said i always want to know i can go home to rome and europe

austrian composer gustav mahler was plagued by 
depression selfpity and writers block as a young man according 
to mahler letters recently acquired by jerusalems hebrew university 
letters by german composer felix mendelssohn also part of the 
new collection show he couldnt handle money but was a family man 
who wrote glowing descriptions of his wife nursing their son 
some of the letters have never been published they will now 
enlighten several aspects of the composers lives said iaacov 
ghelman head of the universitys music department 
in addition to 67 letters by mendelssohn and 46 by mahler the 
correspondence also includes communications from jacques offenbach 
ernst bloch giacomo meyerbeer jacques halevy and arnold 
schoenberg the letters were donated by the widow of new york 
collector otto lobbenberg 
the letters written by the young mahler who was born july 7 
1860 as the son of a jewish peddler in austrian bohemia reveal a 
man in emotional turmoil 
writing to anton krisper a friend from composing class at the 
vienna conservatory the 19yearold mahler described in a feb 14 
1880 letter how he procrastinated instead of composing 
i spent most of my time to indulge in sweet suffering in the 
most wasteful way i lived in my dreams and dreamt while 
awake mahler wrote adding later ill have to taste all the 
sorrows of this world and wont be spared a single one 
mahlers letters to krisper most written in the spring of 1880 
are filled with yearning for the absent friend 
sitting in their old haunt viennas cafe imperial mahler wrote 
an undated letter on cafe stationary i just arrived in vienna and 
immediately went to the place where we shared so much suffering and 
joy my thoughts only revolve around you 
on march 14 1880 he wrote to krisper im so lonely and i 
dont know how much longer i will be able to bear it 
mahlers early years were also marked by restlessness ive 
been in vienna for three months and in addition to various hotels 
have already lived in five apartments you can imagine what that 
does to my work mahler wrote to krisper in january 1883 
again the crying of some little kid is bothering me mahler 
wrote of his abode at the time adding that despite the 
distractions he had completed the first act of ruebezahl an 
opera for which he composed some music in the 1880s 
mahler initially made his name not as a composer but as a 
conductor leading orchestras in prague leipzig budapest hamburg 
and vienna in between conducting he composed nine symphonies the 
10th unfinished as well as several songs and song cycles 
the letters of mahler in later years contained in the collection 
focus more on business than on his personal life as he arranged 
concerts hired artists and quarreled with theater directors 
but in a dec 9 1893 letter to natalie bauerlechner a friend 
mahler expressed deep concern for his younger brother otto whom he 
supported financially and tried to advance as a musician 
dear natalie wrote mahler the second of 14 children and the 
oldest of six to survive childhood today i received a letter from 
otto in which with his usual grandeur he told me with dignity that 
i insulted him and that he could no longer accept my support 
mahler asked natalie to find out discreetly whether otto would 
manage i cant very well answer him since this is the way he 
feels but i dont want him to go hungry or suffer mahler wrote 
otto committed suicide two years later in vienna 
the climax of mahlers career came in 1897 when he was named 
conductor of the vienna court opera he was baptized a catholic just 
before the appointment because at the time noncatholics were barred 
from holding important official positions 
in his letters mahler made no reference to either religion 
suggesting that the conversion for him was just a formality 
mendelssohn a member of an illustrious german jewish family was 
baptized as a 7yearold in 1816 along with his three siblings his 
parents converted to christianity six years later 
as an outward sign of conversion the family added the surname 
bartholdy which according to music publications was that of the 
owners of a garden site purchased by a mendelssohns uncle 
when mendelssohn gave a series of concerts in london in 1829 he 
got in trouble with his father because concert flyers only referred 
to him as mendelssohn 
apparently his father abraham was anxious that the original 
surname by itself sounded too jewish and he suggested at one time to 
his son that it be dropped altogether the younger mendelssohn 
responded in a letter dated july 16 1829 that his english sponsors 
had promised to print the full name mendelssohnbartholdy but then 
reneged 
im convinced it wasnt my fault he wrote i wont ignore 
your orders but i certainly didnt do it on purpose 
mendelssohn described how after his arrival in england he was 
touted in a local magazine as the grandson of moses mendelssohn the 
famous philospher of the englightenment 
from this moment all the musicians called me mendelssohn and 
asked me about my grandfather and his works he wrote the 
people i met asked me about him and said nice things about him 
while proud of his family heritage mendelssohns new religion 
also found an expression both in his work and private life he wrote 
choral music and six organ sonatas and in one undated letter 
expressed his appreciation for spiritual music praising a choir 
concert he attended in england 
the performance recalled to me the effect of chorals when sung 
by the whole congregation and in a crowded church he wrote 
being so free from any harshness of tone and shrieking sound 
something one should not expect from such a mass of voices 
in another letter mendelssohn asked an unnamed friend to be 
godfather to one of his sons showing he apparently accepted his 
baptism as permanent several of the letters show mendelssohn as a 
loving father and husband who took his family responsibilities 
seriously 
on feb 2 1838 one day before his 29th birthday mendelssohn 
wrote to german diplomat karl klingemann a friend since the 1820s 
to express his joy at the birth of a son 
i wanted to tell you how i feel when my little son cries and 
when cecile holds him to her breast and looks at him calmly and 
she is so healthy and charming and good like an angel he wrote 
the obligations of fatherhood sparked a burst of creative energy 
in mendelssohn a prodigy who composed one of his most famous works 
the overture to a midsummer nights dream at age 17 
im in the middle of writing composing and i have to be 
industrious in these years to get ahead i have obligations and also 
the desire to do it mendelssohn wrote to klingemann i could 
finish a new oratorium in one year

bobby brown had completed recording sessions in 
los angeles for his second solo album but felt something was 
missing seeking inspiration he and producer gene griffin headed 
for new york the result was my perogative a no 1 smash off 
the millionselling dont be cruel 
i felt my album was lacking a strong aggressive song and i 
thought where better than new york to come up with it said 
brown an original member of new edition one of the hottest groups 
of the 1980s 
a lot of things had been said about bobby brown why was he 
doing this a solo career its my way of expressing to people its 
your perogative to do as you want but make sure what you do is the 
right thing 
brown has erased any doubts about his decision to leave new 
edition in 1987 although he had originally planned to return to the 
group after one album the success of dont be cruel and his 
first solo record king of stage have established him as a 
major star in his own right 
none of these songs could have come by new edition brown 
said i wanted to express more of me in a group youre limited 
you have different roles 
brown grew up in the same boston ghetto of roxbury as fellow new 
edition members ralph tresvant michael bivins ricky bell and 
ronnie devoe they began singing together in 1981 when brown was 
just 13 and made their debut in a matinee performance at bostons 
high hat club 
we sang a jackson five number brown recalled it was the 
start of something big we enjoyed performing together and we used 
to go around to the matinee clubs we were the ones out of the 
neighborthood who took the time to try and do something better for 
ourselves 
the jackson five would loom large in the early days of new 
edition not only were they both fiveman vocal groups barely into 
their teens but new editions breakthrough hit in 1983 candy 
girl had an uncanny resemblance to jackson 5 songs such as 
abc and the love you save 
the groups had something else in common fans devoted ones 
in one town it got totally out of hand and we all ended up in 
the hospital brown said we were going to the show and when our 
car pulled up a gentleman we thought was with the organizers told us 
to go through this door 
but it was the wrong door the audience turned around and saw 
us and they started chasing us we were terrified 
there were further hit records and soldout shows but new 
edition would run into legal problems when producer maurice starr 
filed suit claiming he had legal rights to the groups name 
although a boston judge ruled in new editions favor brown decided 
in 1987 to go out on his own 
it was time for a direction change brown said i loved the 
group and we will be friends forever but i would catch myself going 
into my own thing at times on stage i have a real energetic type of 
personality they were going for allamerican boys so to speak i 
wanted to express more to my audience 
but brown admitted that the decision took its toll emotionally 
yeah it was tough it took a lot of going over a lot of 
getting used to it wasnt an easy decision by no means they took 
it as well as could be expected we left in good standing 
his first solo album came out in 1987 and contained the single 
girl friend which topped the rampb charts but on stage at 
least some adjusting was necessary 
i went on a tour with ready for the world i got up there and i 
was going through a new edition song like mr telephone man and i 
would start anticipating that ralph would come in for his part he 
said it didnt take me a real long time to get over that 
feeling 
dont be cruel a mixture of uptempo tracks and ballads has 
established brown as a major crossover artist at a time ironically 
that new editions latest album is also topping the charts the 
singers desire to let people see the real bobby brown was 
tested by the title track 
the people in the studio had seen a girl i had brought to the 
rehearsals brown said they got a feeling that she was being 
cruel to me the song was devised around that i knew it was a good 
tune 
but brown didnt anticipate the song reaching the top 5 or the 
album becoming one of the years biggest sellers the singer called 
it a pleasant surprise 
to tell you the truth i was hoping for a single platinum that 
would have been a feat that i would have loved to have attained now 
being multiplatinum is inconceivable im still overwhelmed at the 
numbers

yearning to breathe free they are oxfordeducated professors from 
india wealthy families chased from idi amins uganda factory 
owners fleeing afghanistans upheavals they are americas new 
immigrants arriving via concorde not a refugee boat 
they have found a voice in bharati mukherjee a selfdescribed 
hindu bengali brahmin who was raised in affluence in bombay india 
educated in british and swiss schools before receiving a masters 
and doctorate at the university of iowa and who last year became an 
american citizen 
in january her sixth book the middleman and other stories 
grove press 1595 won the prestigious national book critics 
circle award the honor has been gratifying for two reasons she 
said in a recent interview 
first it has put the book published last spring back on the 
shelves but far more importantly she said it has shown a 
marvelous curiosity and adventurousness on the part of the 
literary establishment to select such an unconventional book 
a country that allows a writer from a minority community or a 
marginalized group to be included as a voice in mainstream american 
literature now thats a tribute to the country said mukherjee 
a slight thoughtful woman with a relaxed laugh and exquisite poise 
during the interview at the associated press offices 
she was asked if she chose the title the middleman because 
immigrants are in effect middlemen shuttling between their 
native and adopted countries 
immigrants are middlemen and i also feel that america is going 
through transition that the country has changed since the 1970s 
with the fast influx of immigrants from nontraditional countries 
she said we are in many ways similar to the european and 
especially the jewish influx of 30 to 40 years ago but in many 
significant ways we who are coming from asia and the caribbean are 
very dissimilar very distinct 
for many of my characters as it was for me coming to america 
is a social comedown i had a life of ease and privilege which i 
have chosen to not to want to continue by living in the united 
states a social demotion ill never have that kind of money and 
physical comfort in this country 
mukherjee 48 who has lived in north america for 28 years has 
wholeheartedly embraced the united states she said she thinks of 
this collection of short stories as my tribute to america this is 
finally my very american book and i want the exuberance to reflect 
the kind of exuberance that this country has released in me that 
none of the countries i have lived in have 
while studying at the university of iowa mukherjee met and 
married clark blaise a novelist and the two moved to canada in 
1968 to teach and write they both became canadian citizens but 
left that country in the late 70s because of racial prejudice and 
physical harassment of foreigners there the couple came to the 
united states and now live in new york city where mukherjee teaches 
fulltime at queens college and parttime at columbia and new york 
universities 
she has written two novels the tigers daughter and 
wife and a previous collection of short stories darkness 
she also has collaborated on two nonfiction books with her husband 
days and nights in calcutta and the sorrow and the terror 
the latter is about the 1985 air india flight that crashed over 
ireland killing 329 people 
the middleman is a departure for her because she now feels 
comfortable adopting the persona of white americans when needed in 
fact this collections power lies in the enormous range of 
characters and locales so convincingly portrayed a vietnam vet who 
becomes a hired killer in florida a trinidad woman who sneaks into 
america from canada and finds work as an au pair a sri lankan high 
school teacher who gets stranded in west germany a young woman from 
a close italian family trying to introduce her afghan lover to her 
bluecollar parents 
when im with ro i feel i am looking at america through the 
wrong end of a telescope thinks the woman with the afghan lover 
in the story orbiting 
he makes it sound like a police state with sudden raids 
papers detention centers deportations and torture and death 
waiting in the wings 
other characters see america as disneyland a nation of infinite 
plenty where adults act like overfed children 
mukherjee said she is not surprised at americans ignorance of 
events and geography beyond their borders i remember as a kid in 
calcutta where we had to know street names in london and paris 
because real life was lived elsewhere and whatever life we lived 
was somewhat devalued by colonialism and postcolonialism i envied 
americans their insularity 
america will learn about the rest of the world when geopolitical 
events force it to she predicted and perhaps the literary worlds 
recognition of the middleman is a small step toward increasing 
understanding of this new and different generation of immigrants 
the people im writing about have had no voice in american 
literature she said and i think one of my tasks becomes 
sensitizing editors of magazines saying look we all exist out 
there the people you sit next to on the no 7 train have enormous 
stories to tell

in a rare contemplative moment for 
country music thunderbolt hank williams jr he paused in his west 
tennessee office and stared at the picture of his parents he winked 
at his mother then fixed his admiring gaze on his dad 
well he said to the large photo showing his famous father 
it looks like ive got a new singing partner and youre no 1 
again 
hank williams sr a country music legend who died in 1953 and 
hank williams jr are finally a duet through the magic of 
technology they sing together on the current song theres a tear 
in my beer 
the previously unreleased song by the elder williams was recently 
discovered improved technologically and vocals by his 39yearold 
son were added the result is one of the most anticipated country 
music releases in years 
its a wonderful feeling to be singing along with him 
something i never thought possible williams said in an interview 
to me you are looking at two rockabilly stars that finally got 
together for one hot shot its just a very contented feeling 
thats an apt description of williams entire career these days 
hes country musics no 1 act right now having been voted 
entertainer of the year two straight times by the country music 
association 
he has a whopping five albums on the country music charts 
including his greatest hits vol 1 which has sold 2 million 
copies 
his concerts 2 hour marathons have set attendance records in 
several cities agents have said he commands up to 100000 per show 
his music reveals him to be an enduring explorer singing blues 
hardcore country and rock n roll his concerts tingle with fury 
as he charges around stage singing his bluecollar anthems and 
rapping with raucous fans who shout their salutes 
his bold baritone celebrates the south with such songs as dixie 
on my mind if heaven aint a lot like dixie and if the 
south woulda won 
but his music is not entirely provincial his a country boy can 
survive is about world tensions something to believe in is 
about the struggles of the common man 
he performs his highvoltage music by playing an array of 
instruments including guitar banjo fiddle piano steel guitar 
harmonica and drums 
i write songs that most of my fans can relate to about 
everyday life he said i play sixseven instruments on stage 
and they know if you are enjoying what you are doing 
hes also had a turbocharged lifestyle having survived cocaine 
use suicide attempts and a 500foot fall off a montana mountain in 
1975 that required a year of anguished recovery his ever present 
beard and sunglasses hide the stubborn scars a spiffy cowboy hat 
tops off his commanding 6foot2 frame which tapers to gleaming 
cowboy boots 
i dont sit around the penthouse and polish my nails he said 
williams who was just 3 when his father died has recorded more 
than 50 albums at one point in 1982 he had an unprecedented nine 
lps on the country music charts 
he made his first public performance at age 8 and was appearing 
on the road not long thereafter he is a high school dropout this 
year marks his 25th year as a recording artist 
im proud of it he said the longevity has been good its 
hard to imagine all the good things that have happened in just the 
past eight years and i aim high 
he inherited a famous name from his father who in the early 
1950s was country musics top star with hits including your 
cheatin heart im so lonesome i could cry and hey good 
lookin 
but it wasnt until this decade that the younger williams decided 
to carve his own style and not be a clone of his father 
i just started doing what i wanted to do not that long ago 
he said all that before doesnt count in my book i was just a 
kid it was do this do that i was not that enamored with the music 
business then it was all built in for me 
he has used music videos to good advantage enlisting rock n 
roll stars van halen comedians cheech and chong and pro football 
stars among dozens of other celebrities who have appeared in them 
i call em up and say this is bocephus his nickname i say do 
you want to do this thing they say yes it amazes me he said 
he recently pondered what his father would say about his career 
hed say boy i knew you was going to do it all the time im 
so proud of you you got out there and did it the way you wanted 
to i think he would be pretty happy over it

mysterious holes that periodically form in the 
ice covering antarctic seas may serve as vents for excess heat and 
trapped gas helping to shape the earths climate and influencing 
the greenhouse effect 
these icefree regions some as large as france werent 
discovered until 1974 when scientists began examining new satellite 
images of antarctica and the frozen ocean encircling it scientists 
dont know if the holes called polynyas existed before then or even 
how frequently they develop in the vast ice cover 
teams of scientists from the soviet union the united states and 
west germany have worked since 1981 to figure out how the holes 
form what role they play in ocean circulation and how they affect 
the climate 
polynya pronounced paleanyah is a russian word used to 
identify an area in an ice field that is persistently free of ice 
said arnold gordon a professor of physical oceanography at columbia 
university in new york 
some oceanographers believe the antarctic polynyas might play a 
role in the greenhouse effect that could have dire consequences in 
the coming century 
as the worlds largest oceans converge in an area unofficially 
named the southern ocean they expel heat from the tropical sun and 
probably some carbon dioxide from decaying fish and plants into the 
atmosphere oceanographers say 
this antarctic zone region is very important to the global 
climate because this is where the ocean loses heat to the 
atmosphere said gordon an authority on polynyas scientists 
believe that during the winter the polynyas act like vents to 
eliminate excess heat and provide outlets for excess carbon dioxide 
that could kill marine life 
some scientists believe the greenhouse effect is caused by excess 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from tropical deforestation and 
burning fossil fuels 
polynyas by venting carbon dioxide also may be acting like 
our burning of fossil fuels and putting more co2 in the atmosphere 
and contributing to the greenhouse effect warming of the climate 
gordon said 
thats why its most critical that we know in the future what 
causes the polynya what effect the heat and co2 flux has on the 
greenhouse effect and how might that be changed in the future as the 
earths atmosphere warms up 
in a search for those answers gordon has visited antarctica 
twice during the southern hemispheres winter he went in 1981 with 
soviet scientists from the arcticantarctic research institute in 
leningrad and in 1986 with a west german team from the alfred 
wegener institute for polar and marine research in bremerhaven 
us soviet and west german scientists plan this summer to sample 
ice and water at varying depths near a large underwater ridge called 
maud rise 
scientists believe this ridge and others in the ocean floor may 
help create polynyas by pushing warmer water from the bottom up to 
the ice cover where it melts the ice or prevents it from forming 
gordon said 
polynyas also may develop because of the antarctic regions role 
in global ocean circulation gordon and josefino c comiso a 
physical scientist with the national aeronautics and space 
administration reported in scientific american 
the exchanges of energy water and gases between the ocean and 
the atmosphere around antarctica have a major role in determining 
the largescale motion temperature and chemical composition of the 
ocean and atmosphere throughout the globe gordon and comiso said 
in their june report 
when the sun warms the oceans in the tropics and subtropics 
the warm water mixes downward by vertical turbulence the heat 
from the upper layers is carried down by turbulence to the deep 
ocean gordon says the warm water is drawn to antartica by a 
complex process called windinduced vertical upwelling as the wind 
blows the upper 300 feet of water northward from antarctica it is 
replaced by the warmer deeper water like a giant conveyer belt 
scientists have identified two types of polynyas in the ice 
blanket that can cover an area up to twice the size of the 
continental united states 
coastal polynyas are essentially seaice factories gordon 
and comiso wrote they develop when strong local winds blow ice away 
from the shoreline and remain unfrozen as warm water surges up from 
the bottom this exposes an area of open ocean on which more ice 
can form continuing the process 
openocean polynyas form in the middle of the vast ice cover on 
the ocean around antarctica and could have a great effect on the 
chemistry and climate of the atmosphere and the deep ocean 
worldwide gordon and comiso wrote but they occur irregularly 
and at this point are unpredictable gordon said 
scientists believe small polynyas about 40 square miles 
probably form for several weeks during the antarctic winter and then 
inexplicably disappear but theyve also discovered much larger 
holes in the ice 
they are so big that you cannot really think they do not have 
any impact at all on the earths climate comiso said in a 
telephone interview 
in 1974 oceanographers found a polynya about the size of france 
in the weddell seas ice cover during the summer the ice melted 
as it usually does but in the winter of 1975 the giant polynya 
mysteriously reformed in just about the same area it disappeared 
again during the summer and reappeared in 1976 in 1977 it didnt 
return smaller polynyas have developed for several weeks since then 
in the same area but the mammoth one hasnt returned 
another large polynya 36000 square kilometers has been 
observed since in the cosmonaut sea also in an area of a large 
undersea ridge gordon said 
the real question he said is what causes these really big 
ones because those are the ones that will have a major impact on 
the climate

a robot surgeon that mimics and 
downsizes human movements could be more precise than the doctors 
guiding it says a surgeon who hopes one day to perform the most 
delicate eye operations by remote control 
dr steve charles who has been working on his robot for about a 
year expects in another year to have equipment ready for testing on 
dummy eyes in the operating room charles 46 says he has spent 
about 300000 so far 
nobody else now is working on robotics operated by a human 
being where it mimics his motions but downsizes them he said 
charles system which uses three groups of machines and 
supporting computers would allow a doctor to view his patients eye 
on a tv screen while performing surgical movements with tools 
similar in concept to joysticks used for video games small 
mechanical arms would actually perform the surgery 
one group would be analogous to a persons head and eye 
muscles that positions the microscope he said the other two 
robots position the surgical tools to work on a dummy head with 
dummy eyes in it 
charles an engineering student in undergraduate school 
specializes in microsurgery that can require removal of tiny scars 
from a patients retina he said the equipment could be adapted to 
other delicate surgery as well 
robots that are manually operated now are for things like 
fixing up nuclear reactors picking up submarine parts at the bottom 
of the ocean or black boxes after airplane crashes the hazardous 
environment stuff charles said theyre like great big 
gorillas now well have a guy that is more precise than the most 
precise watchmaker or surgeon ever was 
he hopes his robot also will let a surgeon operate on a patient 
hundreds or thousands of miles away in remote areas or on a space 
station for example a medical team would be required on the scene 
to set up the equipment and monitor the patient but the surgeon 
could be elsewhere 
charles has set up the center for engineering applications to 
pursue his robot project and signed up roy williams an electrical 
engineer to handle the daytoday lab work the project has 
attracted assistance from engineers and physicians around the 
country including specialists with the national aeronautics and 
space administration and the air force he said 
charles a member of the surgical staff at baptist hospital here 
has gotten a 300000 grant from the baptist memorial health care 
foundation and is looking for further assistance from government 
grants or foundations 
its the kind of thing that will never get finished he said 
it will be evolving with better performance every year we 
anticipate a budget that ultimately will approach the range of 3 
million to 4 million a year 
this is public domain stuff this is not an entrepreneurial 
effort on my part 
much of the progress on developing the equipment will depend on 
continued advances in smallmotor technology and related fields he 
said specialists in those areas say research on smallmotor 
technology is a growth industry

california wines among the most manipulated 
in the world are heavily in debt to science for their quality 
winemaking of course will always be an art said barry jackson 
president of thhe harmony wine co a winemaker is primarily a 
stylist 
it remains for the winemaker to arrive at the crucial decisions 
when to harvest what type of grape how long to age it and whether 
in steel or wood jackson told the american association for the 
advancement of science 
still science has opened new understanding of the way grapes 
grow and how they can flavor the wine said don williams of robert 
mondavi winery weve only recently learned that we can control 
flavor at the grape level 
in the next few years said williams californias traditional 
bushy vines during the growing season might be replaced by 
configurations including narrow leafwalls to better control the 
sunlight received by the vines 
before and during the growing season winemakers will go into the 
vineyards to try to engineer vines and leaves for sunlight and shade 
to produce grapes with character color varietal intensity flavor 
and aroma 
for example a sunlightstarved vine will produce overly 
herbaceous wines grapes that have gotten lots of sun produce 
brighter wines with berry flavors 
other elements in wine flavor arent so easily explained a few 
years ago at a napa valley tasting judges found a wine with 
overtones of eucalyptus they learned that a large stand of 
eucalyptus trees grew near the vineyard

a solarpowered pump thhat tracks the 
sun through the sky with an array of mirrors could be useful for 
irrigating fields and in outoftheway places where maintenance is 
difficult 
a 36squarefoot array could provide power to pump 16000 gallons 
of water a day enough to irrigate 5 to 10 acres said khanh dinh of 
alachua who began developing the pump after he left vietnam in 1975 
and got a 75000 national aeronautics and space administration 
grant for the project in 1982 
vietnamese farmers need an effective way to irrigate rice paddies 
without using dieselfueled pumps 
dinh said his pump would cost about 5000 compared with about 
1000 for a diesel pump over 10 years he estimated the diesel 
pump would cost 13000 in fuel and maintenance the solar pump 
would need little maintenance 
university of florida researchers are monitoring dinhs pump 
before hooking it to an actual irrigation system irrigating farm 
fields requires a constanst flow of water which is difficult for a 
solar system said dorota haman an assistant professor in the 
agricultural engineering department 
agricultural engineering professor c direlle baird said much 
work needs to be done before the pump would be effective for 
irrigation a battery system to store energy for when the sun is 
obscured might be too costly he said 
dihn said his design effectively doubles the collection 
capability of the solar panels he also sees potential uses outside 
agriculture 
the south florida water management district is considering a 
solar pump in the everglades where diesel and electric pumps are 
difficult to maintain

aids is forcing sex therapists to confront new 
ethical issues in deciding how to treat patients who also are 
infected by the virus 
do we as physicians have the right to withhold treatment of 
sexual dysfunction in patients who have a potentially lethal 
disease dr brenda lightfooteyoung of the sepulveda veterans 
administration hospital asked in januarys issue of the western 
journal of medicine 
the ethical dilemma was illustrated by the case of a 55yearold 
aidsinfected man who was unable to have an erection because of 
circulation problems stemming from diabetes before the mans aids 
infection was diagnosed a sex therapy clinic had promised him a 
device that would help him achieve and maintain erections so he 
could have sex after it was revealed the man carried the acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome virus he complained that clinic staff 
members were stalling him 
this patient had frequented bathhouses before his positive 
aids test and was ambivalent regarding his sexual practices in the 
future lightfooteyoung wrote in a letter to the journal he 
made no commitment to use his newly functional penis inside a 
condom 
the man got the device after promising to wear a condom and 
inform any sex partners that he was infected she said in an 
interview 
his case not only raises the question of whether doctors should 
withhold treatment for such peoples sexual disorders but also 
whether treatment should be provided only if patients promise to 
engage only safe sexual activities that wont spread the virus 
to other people 
among the questions it raises said lightfooteyoung are by 
what measure can we be responsible if a patient does infect another 
person while using a device to enhance sexual function 
if we do not treat sexual dysfunction in aidsinfected 
patients are we infringing upon the rights of the individual as 
this patient alleged 
and what of society and our responsibility to the health of 
potential partners are the patients verbal assurances sufficient 
or does there need to be a formal psychiatric assessment of a 
patients stability and reliability

under a bright winter sun off apple cove 
point in puget sound miss melanies crew hauled in the seine and 
dumped a catch of chum salmon on the deck the net was far from 
full but there was no disappointment 
these salmon were meant for laboratories not dinner tables and 
the crew would be paid no matter the size of the catch they only 
needed 200 chum under the northwest indian fisheries commission 
contract 
the fish were cut into samples instead of steaks so biologists 
can learn more about the dozens of runs of chum returning to puget 
sound streams and so fisheries managers can try to maximize the 
catch on strong runs and protect weak stocks by ordering closures 
for specific times and places 
the northern sound where it meets admiralty inlet is a big 
stock area with a wide mix of different species of salmon from 
different parts of puget sound and hood canal said biologist mike 
messenger nobody really has a handle on what that mixture is 
aboard the 55foot miss melanie the chum were hefted onto a 
cutting table susan bishop the indian fisheries commissions 
biologist in charge sliced the fish we collect scales record 
the length of the fish and its sex as well as take tissue samples 
we take muscle tissue and heart and liver tissue 
the salmon species chinook or king coho or silver sockeye 
pink and chum sex and age go into a database used to determine the 
catches that will be allowed next season test fisheries conducted 
during the seasons between spring and fall will allow catch limits 
to be changed midseason 
besides that primary information collection of biological 
samples gives scientists much more complete data on the 
streambystream abundance of salmon runs through a process called 
genetic stock identification 
the samples are quickly frozen on dry ice and taken to a state 
department of fisheries lab where they are pureed together in a 
blender the proteins are removed and put in a dyed gel and an 
electrical field is applied the proteins leave distinctive patterns 
in the gel because each accepts a charge differntly 
with chum stocks from each stream of origin have differing 
proteins so the numbers of fish from each stream can be calculated 
the base line for comparisons is established from chum salmon 
collected from the rivers 
you can break it down into fine details said ms bishop 
for instance you can break it down to the nisqually river 
but salmon run estimates will remain an imprecise science with a 
resource that travels thousands of miles over years before it 
returns to a home stream 
they wont hold still so we can count em said dennis 
austin chief of harvest management for the department of fisheries 
its not like a bunch of oysters 
genetic stock identification is only one of the tools used to 
track fish through their life cycle from stream to ocean to stream 
others include tagging with coded wires inserted in the fishes 
snouts and otolith banding which is marking the fishes 
equivalent of the inner ear for later reading 
gsi works especially well for chum because it can be used for 
wild or freespawning fish and most chum are not hatchery stock 
however some salmon including sockeye have little differences in 
proteins and are thus poor candidates for the process said ms 
bishop 
however the chum study has confirmed tagging studies showing 
movement of various puget sound stocks of the species she said in 
some cases especially with depressed stocks it shows were doing 
the right thing

american airlines will buy up to 60 new 
mcdonnell douglas jets in a multibillion dollar contract that will 
enable the carrier to retire many of its older widebody jets news 
reports of the deal said today 
airline spokesman ed stewart told the associated press the 
airline would have a major announcement tuesday morning and declined 
to elaborate but unidentified industry sources quoted by the dallas 
morning news and wall street journal said american officials would 
unveil the aircraft order then 
the accounts said american is expected to order between 50 and 60 
md11 widebody jets which carry around 320 passengers the md11s 
have a list price of 100 million but americans actual purchase 
price will probably be in the range of 80 million85 million per 
plane according to industry estimates 
the md11 announcement is expected to include a handful of firm 
orders for the aircraft with the remainder in options to buy 
american also has negotiated the purchase of as many as 100 
md80s a smaller twinjet manufactured by mcdonnell douglas that 
sells for about 20 million apiece but wasnt clear whether the 
carrier would announce an order for that plane as well 
such an order marks a major victory for mcdonnell douglas in the 
intense competition with larger rival boeing co and the aggressive 
european consortium airbus industrie 
american based in fort worth texas is one of the biggest us 
carriers and mcdonnell douglass most important customer

futures prices of grain and soybeans opened mostly 
lower today on the chicago board of trade on perceptions that 
fridays late rally had been largely unwarranted 
the runup late in fridays trading session was sparked by reports 
that the soviet union had ordered the evacuation of 20 ukrainian 
villages in an area contaminated with radiation from the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear accident 
you heard the word chernobyl and everybody started to buy on 
fears of a new radiation leak and contamination of soviet crops 
said victor lespinasse a grain trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago 
but cooler heads prevailed this morning as traders realized there 
had been no new radiation leakage and no cause for alarm 
heavy weekend snowfall in the corn belt was another bearish 
factor in the corn and soybean markets 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 428 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents lower with march at 270 a bushel oats were cent lower 
to cent higher with march at 218 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent 
to 3 cents lower with march at 768 a bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange

at 7537 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 20 
cent higher with march at 8445 cents a pound live hogs were 25 
cent to 72 cent lower with february at 4330 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 35 cent to 50 cent lower with february at 4045

if financial and economic proposals by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady are representative of the bush 
administrations goals then eyes will be focused on the long term 
long term is a concept that had been trampled and forgotten by 
american business in government financial crises made 
implementation impossible at the consumer level it showed up as 
spending rather than saving 
to change such ingrained attitudes is an enormous challenge made 
even more difficult by two related symptoms of the recent past a 
deterioration of quality and a tendency of americans to prefer 
consumption to production 
making it easier however is the fact that in some respects the 
change already is in motion 
a bit of background 
after the easy days of the 1960s some american industries went 
to sleep assured that they were the best and that it was up to 
others to catch them the others such as the japanese caught 
them and then outperformed them 
with the pressure on many us manufacturers sought desperately 
to keep sales and earnings from shrinking by resorting to 
expedients thinking became short term to meet the immediate 
challenge quality suffered 
adding to the pressure was the new attitude on wall street which 
stressed immediate profits rather than longterm strength it made 
investing for the long term all the more difficult traders wanted 
results now not later 
runaway inflation worsened things shortening the focus even 
more and rising interest rates created an almost impossible 
situation how could anyone focus on a long term that couldnt be 
foreseen shortterm survival was in 
eventually american industry and government and individuals had 
to face the music while opportunists and exploiters of the 
situation could benefit for the short term such as by borrowing and 
repaying in cheap dollars the general public and its institutions 
were being weakened to collapse 
faced with the inevitable industry caught hold of itself bit 
the bullet took its shortterm losses invested in capital 
improvements whose payoff was years into the future raised quality 
and sought to become more competitive 
for many companies automotive concerns for example it paid 
off and once again they are healthy higher quality has been built 
not just into physical facilities but into the thinking of workers 
and executives 
unions helped recognizing that the only way to reclaim jobs lost 
to foreign companies was to restrain wages and cooperate in raising 
productivity and as inflation cooled realistic plans for the 
future could be made again 
the process though under way still has a long way to go 
the investing scene has been a notable laggard with corporate 
raiders still seeking instant profits versus longterm performance 
and brokers urging investors to trade on shortterm news rather than 
investing for the future 
in the consumer area there is still a tendency to live beyond 
means as shown by the persistence of installment debt and a savings 
rate that remains relatively low but that too has begun to change 
and some analysts forecast a steady increase in savings as the 
socalled babyboomer generation ages 
if there is indeed a growing tendency to think longer term today 
it seemingly couldnt be hurt by a lift from public policy 
among other things brady would consider lowering the capital 
gains tax on longterm investments to just 15 percent compared with 
28 percent to 33 percent now hoping thereby to encourage longterm 
investing 
pension fund managers who sit on the largest mound of financial 
assets in the world would be encouraged in ways not yet made clear 
to invest for longterm rewards and leveraged buyouts would somehow 
be curtailed or discouraged 
whether these particular techniques will work is likely to be 
debated vigorously 
but it isnt likely that therell be much debate about the long 
term versus short term issue itself those bad old days are still 
fresh enough to serve as a warning

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs 
dropped this week by 17 to total 780 as the count continued its 
seesaw activity industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
last week the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797 while 
plummeting by 51 the week before the previous three weeks the count 
declined twice by 32 and once by 36 all following a twoweek 
increase of 25 rigs 
a year ago the number of rigs totaled 986 baker hughes said 
monday 
the decline follows normal seasonal patterns according to baker 
hughes economist ike kerridge the count usually drops off during 
late december through late march or early april he said 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states california and oklahoma saw a 
decline at four followed by ohio two and michigan new mexico 
north dakota pennsylvania and texas one each 
colorado kansas and louisiana had gains of two each while

a us offer of a 35 billion emergency loan 
remains open officials said monday even though mexico has decided 
not to borrow the money and is trying to renegotiate payments on its 
crippling foreign debt 
treasury secretary pedro aspe was beginning talks in washington 
armed with what aides described as a menu of options for 
repaying the 106 billion mexico owes foreign creditors 
late sunday the treasury department issued a brief statement 
saying mexico would not use the 35 billion shortterm loan the 
us offered in october 
the money the largest single us loan ever offered to a 
debtburdened nation was intended as a cushion against political 
and economic instablity during a change in administrations 
us officials said the money is still available if mexico wants 
it 
the offer does not expire until april us embassy spokesman 
steve telkins said in a telephone interview 
the treasury department statement said mexico didnt need the 
35 billion shortterm loan because the bank of mexicos 
international reserves stopped falling in december it did not 
elaborate 
the loan was aimed at helping mexico weather the sensitive months 
before the dec 1 inauguration of president carlos salinas de 
gortari 
a change of administrations in mexico historically has been 
marked by a drain on capital caused by businesses and the wealthy 
who fear changes in economic policies and send money abroad as a 
protection the united states wanted to help mexico avoid the 
pressure such an exodus puts on the peso currency which has been 
devalued severely over the past several years 
the bank has said about 16 billion has returned to mexico in 
recent months 
the loan also was intended to tide mexico over until it could 
renegotiate new credit packages with the international monetary fund 
and other world lending institutions 
salinas is facing widespread public impatience with a 7yearold 
economic crisis that has stagnated growth and halved the average 
workers buying power 
voters gave him the smallest victory margin in 60 years of his 
ruling partys history in the july 6 election and even this slim 
victory was clouded by widespread allegations of fraud 
salinas has said renegotiating the debt is his top priority and 
that payments must be cut enough to let mexicos economy start 
growing again 
mexico has been devoting the equivalent of nearly six per cent of 
its gross national product to satisfy debt payments last year the 
payments most of them interest came to about 13 billion 
about 40 percent of the foreign debt the secondlargest in the 
developing world after brazils is owed to us banks 
there was no official comment from the treasury department monday 
on what options aspe planned to present to creditors in washington 
but news reports said that among the ideas under consideration were 
debtforinvestment swaps in which creditor banks would exchange 
some debt for an equity stake in mexican businesses

bankruptcy protection in november on monday reported it lost 131 
billion in the fourth quarter because of costs from its 
restructuring 
the loss in the final quarter of the year compared with a 5998 
million shortfall in the same period of 1987 
the results of the latest quarter reflected a 13 billion charge 
from manvilles chapter 11 reorganization 
manville president tom stephens said in a statement the company 
expected the charge as the price we knew we had to pay to put our 
asbestos financial obligations behind us 
the company filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws in 
1982 because of claims from people who suffered illnesses because of 
contact with asbestos 
without the charge manville said it would have lost 263 
million in the fourth quarter 
manville reported fourthquarter sales of 5221 million up from 
486 million a year earlier 
for the full year manville reported a loss of nearly 13 
billion compared to earnings of 726 million or 61 cents per 
share in all of 1987 
the fullyear loss also included a 139 million pretax charge 
for environmental cleanup costs and a 107 million charge for an 
accounting change 
without the charges manville said it would have earned nearly 
96 million in 1988 
fullyear sales totaled 206 billion up from 194 billion

share prices fell sharply monday on the london 
stock exchange depressed largely by data showing british retail 
sales were higher in december than had been initially reported 
the data which dispelled some hopes of an early cut in domestic 
interest rates added to profittaking pressure which followed the 
markets surge of about 250 points since the start of the year 
at the close of trading the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index was down 256 points or 123 percent at 20443 a 
weak opening on wall street helped drag the london index down as 
much as 264 points in the late afternoon 
volume was moderate with 5615 million shares changing hands 
well below fridays turnover of 7687 million shares 
the markets recent strong rise has been partly due to 
indications of a slowdown in consumer demand which in turn helped 
to inspire hopes of a cut in british interest rates perhaps around 
the time of the fiscal 1990 budget presentation in march 
those hopes were at least partly dispelled by a revision to the 
december retail sales figures which were adjusted upward to a gain 
of 03 percent from a preliminary reported decline of 01 percent 
the narrower financial times 30share index was down 208 points 
at 16682

president bushs plan to bail out the savings 
and loan industry will include a temporary hike in insurance 
premiums paid by banks and sampls as well as a revamped regulatory 
structure an industry official said today 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush would 
announce his plan to resolve the sampl crisis at a lateafternoon news 
conference and would not propose that depositors be required to pay 
a fee 
banks have been given assurances that the money raised by the 
higher premiums will go into their own insurance fund and will not 
directly pay for the sampl problem said the source who was briefed 
by white house aides but declined to be identified 
however for budget purposes the money raised by the premiums 
will count as revenue thus in an arrangement envisioned by white 
house budget director richard darman the government would be able 
to spend several billions of taxpayer dollars a year without adding 
to the budget deficit a government official said 
insurance premiums are currently 83 cents per 1000 for banks 
and 208 for sampls the increase mentioned at least before bush 
reviewed the plan would bring the premiums to about 180 per 
1000 for banks and 250 for sampls that would raise about half the 
7 billion to 9 billion needed each year 
another element of the plan would merge the federal deposit 
insurance corp which insures bank deposits with the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp a new fivemember board would 
oversee the two insurance funds 
meanwhile a separate threemember board chaired by the secretary 
of the treasury would control the spending of the new money raised 
to close or sell the 350 insolvent sampls remaining open 
the federal home loan bank board will lose control of the sampl 
insurance fund and it will be brought into the treasury department 
in a system similar to the one used for banks where the regulatory 
agency the office of the comptroller of the currency is part of 
the treasury 
a presidential aide richard c breeden and federal reserve 
board chairman alan greenspan advocate this arrangement which will 
be strongly opposed by the sampl industry which wants to keep its 
regulator independent of other government controls the industry 
official said 
the president will propose a permanent and comprehensive 
solution to the sampl situation as well as a financing arrangement 
that does not include depositor fees spokesman fitzwater said 
earlier 
the plan will deal with problem thrifts as well as the 
foundation for future stability in the industry he said 
the president will propose reforms in the federal regulatory 
structure and he will assure all americans that the full faith 
and credit of the united states government stands behind their 
deposits and that the american banking system remains sound the 
spokesman said 
fitzwater said the administration had conferred with 
congressional leaders and said we think therell be general 
support for this proposal 
another financing problem is how to sell the bonds without 
inflating the governments already huge 27 trillion national debt 
a way around that is to cover the principal of the bonds with 
several billion dollars in retained earnings at the regional federal 
home loan banks which are owned by the industry that way only the 
annual interest paid on the bonds would be onbudget 
however the money is raised congress and the administration are 
sure to assume more control over how it is spent members of 
congress have complained bitterly about sampl regulators power to 
write promissory notes committing the government to vast 
expenditures that the regulators cannot pay in effect writing 
checks that congress later will be forced to cover with 
appropriations 
other likely recommendation would require sampl owners to put up 
more of their own money force sampls to keep more cash reserves for 
liquidity limit the amount they can loan to a single borrower and 
more strictly control who can buy or start an sampl

after more than two years of taunts feints and 
jabs eastern airlines management and its largest union are standing 
toetotoe with a potential slugfest threatening the moneylosing 
carriers survival 
the national mediation board a year after entering eastern 
contract talks with its machinists union last week declared an 
impasse and began a 30day coolingoff period that ends march 3 
if no settlement is reached by then the company would impose its 
last contract offer 150 million in salary cuts and the 
8500member union representing more than onefourth of eastern 
employees would be allowed to strike 
the two sides are 200 million apart with the machinists last 
offer seeking a 50 million raise but money is only part of the 
confrontation marked by deep philosophical differences 
veteran eastern machinistsleader charles e bryan the district 
100 president has tried unsuccessfully to engineer an 
employeecontrolled takeover believing that a company whose workers 
have a say in decisionmaking and a stake in profits will work 
efficiently and productively he believes his workers have been 
paying for poor management for years and have current management 
that doesnt care about easterns future 
the eastern management put in place by houstonbased texas air 
corp since it took over the carrier 2 years ago seeks a lean 
operation with the shots called by corporate executives they see an 
airline with good routes experience and overall good structure that 
needs to reduce operating costs mainly labor to turn around 
after losing 1 billion the past decade 
bryan played a leading role in bringing down former eastern 
leader frank borman the apollo astronaut replaced after texas air 
bought eastern in an 11thhour deal in february 1986 
but easterns new management features airline experience directed 
by frank lorenzo a bottomline entrepreneur who got rid of 
continental airlines unions after taking over that airline 
bryan went to the floor of the eastern shareholders meeting 
arguing against the texas air takeover and he has been the focus 
since of widespread eastern labor opposition to the new management 
whose style has aggravated traditionally tense labor relations at 
eastern 
the machinists pilots and flight attendants unions have tried to 
head off management at any pass waging myriad lawsuits and 
grievances and lobbying politicians 
but recent months have seen events going the costcutting 
managements way 
it won court approval for 4000 layoffs and major route cuts last 
year along with the 365 million sale of its profitable northeast 
shuttle to new york developer donald trump the department of 
transportation refused to reopen last years probe that concluded 
eastern was operated safely 
management has been lobbying for months for declaration of an 
impasse insisting that bryan and the iam wont seriously negotiate 
until they are faced with a deadline 
bryan says management has been trying to provoke a strike and 
will try to break the strike and bust easterns unions bryan said 
that hell work for a settlement but his union will be ready for a 
wingding of a strike 
the national mediation boards lead mediator harry bickford has 
met with both sides separately in recent days and is expected to 
continue such shuttle diplomacy if talks get to the final 10 
days nmb chairman walter c wallace will jawbone the two sides in 
supermediation participants expect 
it seems unlikely there will be any settlement before the final 
few hours putting pressure on travel agents but eastern management 
is counting on strong frequentflier business travel to stick with 
the airline despite uncertainty 
eastern has been to the brink before in 1983 the machinists 
went to the final days of a coolingoff period before a settlement 
was reached in 1986 strikes and bankruptcy were hours away when 
deals were cut to avoid selling eastern

futures prices of corn and soybeans fell sharply 
monday on the chicago board of trade resuming a trend that had been 
interrupted in fridays session by unwarranted fears of a radiation 
leak in the soviet union 
wheat and oat futures also closed lower 
grain futures gave back all the gains posted friday when a late 
rally was sparked by reports that the soviet union had ordered the 
evacuation of 20 ukrainian villages in an agricultural area 
contaminated with radiation from the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident 
the mere mention of the chernobyl incident apparently was enough 
to prompt heavy buying of us grain futures on friday but the 
realization that there had been no new radiation leakage was a key 
factor in mondays selloff analysts said 
analysts said heavy weekend snow in the corn belt which will add 
badly needed moisture to the soil also contributed to mondays 
decline 
at the close of trading wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 425 a bushel corn was 4 
cents to 6 cents lower with march at 266 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 4 cents lower with march at 214 a bushel soybeans were 
11 cents to 16 cents lower with march at 754 a bushel

satellites will continue to be competitive with 
undersea fiber optic cables for communications between continents 
over the next 15 years according to a study released monday by a 
satellite company 
the study by communications satellite corp disproves the notion 
that fiber optic cables are destined to drive satellites out of 
business said richard mcgraw a company spokesman 
comsat a private company based in washington dc that 
provides satellite service is the us governments representative 
to the international telecommunications satellite organization 
the study covered the period from 1995 to 2005 comsat said that 
was as far into the future as it could make realistic predictions 
mcgraw said comsat was sensitive to appearances that it would tip 
the findings in favor of satellites and had actually given the 
benefit of the doubt to fiber optics in cost comparisons

pork futures prices collapsed monday in a disappointed reaction 
to indications that wintry conditions in the midwest had not slowed 
the movement of hogs to packing houses 
in other markets orangejuice futures continued to decline 
grain and soybean futures fell sharply precious metals advanced 
and energy futures weakened 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live hog futures finished 50 
cent to 142 cents lower with the contract for delivery in february 
at 4270 cents a pound most contracts for future delivery of frozen 
pork bellies plummeted the permitted daily limit of 2 cents with 
february settling at 3882 cents a pound 
cattle futures fared much better live cattle settled 40 cent 
lower to 10 cent higher with february at 7540 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 40 cent higher with march at 
8447 cents a pound 
expectations for a coldweather slump in hog marketings turned 
out to be a bust for speculators who had bid pork futures up sharply 
on friday 
instead of a decline packers reported that hog marketings over 
the weekend and on monday were higher than both weekago and 
yearago levels the hog flow in iowa and southern minnesota for 
example totaled 120000 head on monday compared with 110000 a 
week earlier and 95000 a year ago 
spotmarket prices for hogs plunged by as much as 3 cents a pound 
and the futures market followed suit with porkbelly contracts 
leading the way 
thats what happens when you dont get enough of a storm 
said tom ohare a livestockmarket analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
the plunging pork prices led to some weakness in the cattle 
market but many cattle traders were reluctant to sell ahead of 
wednesdays national cattle inventory report from the agriculture 
department 
that report is expected to show the nations cattle herd as of 
jan 1 at its lowest level since 1960 said charles levitt senior 
livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
weatherrelated selling also hit orangejuice futures on the new 
york cotton exchange 
frozen concentrated orange juice settled 4 cents to 46 cents 
lower with march at 1354 a pound as fears of a freeze in the 
florida citrus groves continued to ease 
corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of 
trade resuming a trend that had been interrupted in fridays

energy futures prices were mostly lower in light 
trading monday influenced in part by opecrelated concerns 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil settled 
15 cents lower at 1738 a barrel after seesawing last week 
other contract months also declined 
among refined products traded on the exchange the march contract 
for domestic heating oil rose 05 cent to 5036 cents a gallon but 
other contract months fell 
unleaded gasoline for march delivery closed 043 cent lower at 
4874 cents a gallon with other contract months ending the day mixed 
analysts said prices were little influenced by the cold weather 
despite rumors of refinery slowdowns in southern texas they said 
the cold weather arrived late in the season after most buyers had 
already purchased their winter stocks 
jim fiedler vice president of edampf man international futures 
inc attributed much of the price decline to technical factors 
theyre looking for a new support level probably heading down 
to 17 fiedler said 
prices also came under pressure from a report by the middle east 
economic survey a respected industry publication that iran had a 
large buildup of unsold inventory that it was looking to get rid of 
said nauman barakat vice president of energy investments at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
my own opinion is that iran wont dump it but the question is 
what will they do with it barakat said 
since the organization of petroleum exporting countries lowered 
its production by some 4 million barrels a day to 185 million 
barrels on jan 1 market observers have expressed concern over the 
whereabouts of all the excess oil 
many had expected world oil prices to remain soft while the 
oversupply came on the market instead prices have soared over the 
last several weeks leaving analysts to wonder what happened to the 
excess 
mondays report on iran was one of the first to confirm existence 
of the excess petroleum

pennzoil cos disclosure of a stake in burlington 
resources inc raised speculation monday that the oil company has 
found a way to spend a big chunk of the 3 billion cache won from a 
protracted battle with texaco inc 
although pennzoil said it had acquired about 12 million shares of 
burlington as an investment or about an 8 percent interest the 
company did not rule out future transactions 
we may dispose of all our part of the stock or we may buy 
additional shares pennzoil spokesman bob harper said 
harper said houstonbased pennzoil is not looking to force a 
merger reorganization liquidation sale or transfer of a 
material amount of assets or any change of management in 
burlington a large seattlebased diversified resource and energy 
holding company 
on the new york stock exchange monday burlingtons stock soared 
987 a share to 4912 compared with fridays close pennzoil 
closed up 150 at 8325 a share 
pennzoil filed documents with the securities and exchange 
commission on friday because it had exceeded 5 percent ownership of 
burlington stock harper said under sec rules any investment in a 
publicly held company that passes the 5 percent threshhold must be 
reported to the federal agency 
pennzoil disclosed it had bought nearly 86 million shares of 
burlington resources stock for about 300 million and got 34 
million more shares as a result of a distribution by burlington 
northern inc in addition pennzoil purchased another 355000 shares 
earlier this month the company said 
burlington resources was spun off last year from burlington 
northern 
the stock acquisition was an investment but pennzoil said in its 
sec filing it will take actions deemed appropriate pending its 
continued review of burlingtons business affairs 
a spokesman for burlington resources did not return telephone 
calls monday 
industry observers have been waiting to see how pennzoil would 
spend the 3 billion settlement it received last april from texaco 
to end the companies fouryear legal battle over texacos 
acquisition of getty oil co 
prior to the burlington stock purchase pennzoils only major 
investment since the texaco settlement had been the 250 million 
purchase of facet enterprise inc of oklahoma city facet 
manufactures automotive parts and oilfield equipment 
one analyst said monday that pennzoils stock acquisition doesnt 
mean burlington is an actual takeover target 
their move is perplexing said paul kuklinski of cowen amp co 
in boston it is not clear to me if this is anything more than an 
investment typically when a company acquires this size of stock 
the intention is fairly evident but not this time 
kuklinski said that in the past pennzoil has acquired fairly 
good amounts of stock for investment purposes and not followed 
through with takeover attempts 
in addition burlington has some attractive assets it would be 
expensive to buy he said 
but other analysts said they believe pennzoil is positioning 
itself for a takeover whether by accumulating more stock on the 
open market or by making an offer before burlington has the 
opportunity to put up more barriers 
burlington has shown little interest in being acquired 
installing a poison pill and other takeover defenses in 
december the pill designed to make an unwelcome takeover 
prohibitively expensive would be triggered when a hostile bidder 
acquired 20 percent or more of the voting power of burlington 
resources 
the cat is in the bag im sure they wont sit on their hands 
on this one i think they will actively pursue something one way or 
another said ron londe an analyst with ag edwards in st louis 
londe said pennzoil likely wont take the whole company but 
gas reserves are first on the menu 
burlington is believed to hold the largest natural gas reserves 
in the united states outside of the major oil companies with a 
nearly 18year supply compared with an industry average of 10 years 
a merger of pennzoil and burlington would propel the company into 
a position just under the majors in natural gas reserves londe said 
they would have 58 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves that 
means a lot he said 
burlington resources largest units include el paso natural gas 
co which consists of a 22000mile interstate gas transmission 
system extending from west texas to california and meridian oil co 
one of the nations largest independent oil and gas companies 
burlington also has extensive mining operations including gold 
and more than a million acres of timberland 
analysts valued burlington resources stock at between 49 and 51 
a share

dividend on gm 1 23 par value common stock

important evidence of the great strength of the company and in 
particular the continued success of gms reindustrialization 
program gm chairman roger b smith said

more affordable for individual investors following the stocks 
significant appreciation over the past year smith said

common shares covered by its stock repurchase program from 64 
million to 128 million the statement said gm announced the program

ltv corp the troubled aerospacesteelmaker said 
monday its profit dropped 32 percent in the fourthquarter 
primarily because of a charge involving an accounting change for 
medical and life insurance benefits 
for the year the company said it lost 315 billion mainly due 
to special charges taken earlier in the year the company has been 
operating under bankruptcy court protection for more than two years 
while it struggles to find a formula to cut expenses and pay 
creditors 
the company said fourthquarter results were hurt by a 338 
million charge relating to medical and life insurance benefits 
it said other factors contributing to the fourthquarter profit 
decline included a steep drop in aerospace and defense earnings 
absence of operating income from the warren ohio steel facility it 
sold last june and exclusion of results for the steel bar division 
which will be sold 
for the quarter aftertax profit totaled 953 million or 67 
cents per share compared with 1406 million or 101 per share 
in 1987 
fourthquarter revenue fell 161 percent to 167 billion from 
199 billion a year earlier 
the companys huge 1988 loss contrasts to a profit of 5026 
million or 367 a share in the previous year 
revenue for the year fell 3 percent to 732 billion from 758 
billion in 1987 
ltv officials said the annual loss resulted in part from chapter 
11related noncash special charges of 135 billion taken earlier 
in 1988 it also included a onetime noncash charge of 226 
billion taken in the third quarter for what the company anticipates 
will be its potential liability in health insurance costs of 118000 
current and retired employees 
while special charges led to a net loss overall operating 
results continued to show a positive trend said raymond a hay 
ltv chairman and chief executive they demonstrate that ltvs 
businesses are sound and that the company is taking the right steps 
to make its operations efficient and competitive 
the deferral of interest pension and other costs while in 
chapter 11 continues to be the major factor contributing to positive 
results hay said however strong demand for steel and improved 
steel prices were also important contributors for both the quarter 
and the year

despite some reservations securities analysts 
generally applauded president bushs announcement monday of a 
savings and loan industry bailout plan that includes higher federal 
insurance premiums for banks as well as thrifts 
its something the whole system can live with james wilson 
an analyst with sutro amp co in san francisco said of the deposit 
insurance premium hike a key part of bushs proposal 
under bushs plan the higher premiums would be used to help pay 
the interest on 50 billion in bonds to finance the bailout of 
insolvent thrifts 
its a big dollar figure but its an enormous industry the 
effect on individual depositors or homebuyers isnt going to be 
enough for them to notice signficantly wilson said 
allan bortel an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in san 
francisco said the premiums that are being increased are very 
small it doesnt raise much more money each year from savings 
instiutions 
it doesnt seem to be onerous for the sampls he said 
but james marks of snl securities in hoboken nj said the 
proposed increase could force some shaky thrifts over the edge 
they cant afford to pay as much as they are now marks said 
to increase themcould force thrifts that would otherwise have 
survived into insolvency 
the analysts said banks and thrifts could be expected to pass on 
at least a portion of their costs to consumers possibly in the form 
of lower interest rates on savings accounts or in higher service or 
loan charges 
but the analysts did not expect depositors to withdraw money from 
sampls because of the possibility they might ultimately pay for the 
higher premiums 
with the rise in shortterm interest rates money market funds 
are extremely attractive right now marks said people are 
looking at what they can get but it has nothing to do with this 
analysts said people who are concerned about the safety of their 
money will leave it in thrifts because those deposits are 
federallyinsured while money market funds are not making them 
slightly riskier 
bush also recommended combining the federal savings amp loan 
insurance corp which insures deposits at thrifts with the 
insurance fund for banks the federal deposit insurance corp while 
keeping each agencys funds separate 
the president proposed regulatory changes including steps to 
reduce the type of risky investments that got the industry into 
difficulty he also suggested that insolvent savings and loan 
institutions be placed under the joint control of the fdic and fslic 
you have a much larger staff they can work with at the fdic 
some of them quite experienced in real estate a trouble spot for 
many thrifts sutro said 
overall the analysts were pleased that the government was trying 
to end the thrift crisis which has seen hundreds of sampls forced 
into insolvency 
but said wilson to some degree its almost too little too 
late most of the problems that led to thrift bailouts such as 
mismanagement or fraud at some institutions and the economic 
depression in the southwest have already happened he said 
however the plan should be more expeditious in solving the 
current problems wilson said 
shearsons bortel called bushs proposals a step in the right 
direction but said they did not provide enough money for the 
hundreds of savings institutions that still are short of funds

president bushs proposed rescue package for 
the savings and loan industry while praised as a good starting 
point raised immediate questions on monday concerning the huge 
burden being placed on taxpayers 
members of congress and the financial industry said the plan is 
likely to be substantially modified before winningcongressional 
approval although officials gave bush credit for moving quickly to 
address the crisis 
the president deserves credit for at least putting a plan on 
the table said rep charles schumer dny and a member of the 
house banking committee he faced up to a difficult problem that 
president reagan spent a year ducking 
senate republican leader bob dole said bushs proposal gives us 
a starting point well probably have a lot of people who dont like 
this plan 
dole himself raised questions about the amount of the tab 
taxpayers will be asked to shoulder bushs budget director richard 
darman estimated that the cost in direct taxpayer funds would 
amount to 399 billion over the next 10 years 
dole called that figure a little high it would begin to crowd 
some of these other programs congress wants like education the 
environment i would propose we shrink the taxpayer impact 
barney beeksman chairman of the us league of savings 
institutions the largest lobbying group for the sampl industry said 
in a statement he was glad bush dropped his proposal to impose a 
premium tax on depositors but he said the league had reservations 
about other parts of the plan 
we are neither endorsing nor rejecting it beeksman said 
there are components of the presidents proposal that would be 
burdensome to our industry if adopted but we see todays proposal 
as a first step only 
bud koch chairman of the national council of savings 
institutions another sampl trade association said his organization 
was unhappy because bushs plan would not eliminate the discrepancy 
between sampls and banks over the amount they pay in deposit insurance 
premiums 
the basic inequalities that the healthy sampls have lived under 
for four years are still there said koch the president of first 
federal savings bank of cleveland 
the american bankers association said in a statement that it was 
glad that the nations banks were not being asked to pay to resolve 
the sampl crisis 
the burden to fund this crisis will fall largely on the savings 
and loans themselves where it belongs said cg holthus 
presidentelect of the aba we are encouraged that apparently 
banks and their customers will not be asked to bail out the sampls 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan appeared at bushs news 
conference where the plan was unveiled and in a statement issued 
later expressed support for the proposal 
this comprehensive package of measures to strengthen the thrift 
industry and depository institutions generally should assure that 
the problems that occurred in the savings and loans will not happen 
again greenspan said in a statement 
rep henry b gonzalez chairman of the house banking committee 
said he was withholding judgment on bushs proposal until it was 
analyzed 
but he praised bush and treasury secretary nicholas brady for 
their sensitivity to the seriousness of the problem and for 
presenting under pressure a formal proposal worthy of careful and 
most serious consideration 
sen donald w riegle dmich the chairman of the senate 
banking committee promised to move the legislation quickly 
i think the proposal is by and large a sensible proposal he 
said i think the structural reforms make sense and the proposed 
changes in the law would put an end to the excessive practices 
that have led so many sampls to failure 
but riegle said the taxpayer cost was a substantial amount of 
money he said he was concerned federal programs such as fighting 
drugs and helping education not be hurt as a result 
sen phil gramm rtexas praised bush and said he supported the 
solution even though any answer to a 50 billion problem wasnt 
something youd want to embrace and kiss on the mouth 
i think youre going to see some real bipartisanship here he 
said i think we have a reasonable proposal before us 
rep trent lott rmiss said he had some questions on 
specifics such as including credit unions in the premium increases 
but believed the major portion of it will fly 
rep john j lafalce dny a member of the banking committee 
said he had some concerns but overall the plan was praiseworthy 
there is no solution without cost and without pain he said 
this plan tries to ensure that both are fairly shared

employees of two companies battling hostile 
takeover bids from outofstate pursuers have banded together and on 
monday appealed to gov michael s dukakis for help but he told 
them his options are restricted 
the governor said an important reason he could not make a 
stronger commitment to prime computer inc and polaroid corp two 
important massachusetts employers was that both companies are 
incorporated in delaware though they have their headquarters in 
massachusetts nevertheless he said they deserve massachusetts 
protection 
what a state can do is limited legally dukakis told 2500 
employees of prime at its headquarters 
both polaroid and prime face hostile corporate takeovers launched 
by smaller firms seeking to borrow hundreds of millions to finance 
the transactions 
last week a group called pact people against corporate 
takeovers was formed by employees of prime and polaroid members of 
the group said monday they are trying to expand to other companies 
that are facing takeover battles 
dukakis drew thunderous applause from the crowd in what sounded 
like one of his presidential campaign speeches 
im a free enterpriser im an entrepreneur dukakis said 
but there also have to be some reasonable rules of the game 
how can you spend your time thinking about what youre going to 
do for your company when youre not even sure whether the company is 
going to exist in a couple of years dukakis said 
the governor said he plans to go to washington wednesday and will 
lobby for federal legislation that would change tax laws that 
encourage debtfinanced takeovers sometimes called leveraged 
buyouts 
as the phenomenon of hostile highly leveraged corporate 
takeovers continues subsidized by the federal tax laws our 
international competitors must be laughing all the way to the 
bank dukakis said 
as dukakis spoke in the packed atrium of primes suburban 
headquarters with hundreds of other employees watching on 
closedcircuit television polaroid officials were in us district 
court in boston seeking to block the takeover of their company 
attorneys for the instant photography giant sought an injunction 
against shamrock holdings inc arguing that the pursuer has been 
making false statements about polaroids current ecponomic strength 
prime meanwhile is a week away from yet another deadline set by 
mai basic four inc for its 970 million 20pershare takeover 
offer to buy prime a much larger company prime is scheduled to be 
in federal court in boston tuesday to argue its case that mai is 
seeking to borrow too much 15 billion according to prime in 
its buyout bid 
mondays meeting and speech came a day after a special 
massachusetts commission on corporate takeovers issued preliminary 
recommendations on how the state can curb the practice two of the 
recommendations involved increased lobbying efforts in washington 
other proposals included forcing corporate takeover strategists 
to provide laidoff employees with substantial benefits and pension 
programs 
william benjamin one of the prime employees in the audience 
called it very encouraging for dukakis to visit regardless 
of whether theres any weight behind it 
prime employs 5000 people in massachusetts polaroid employs 
about 8000 company spokesmen said 
daniel jones representing prime employees said a takeover by 
mai would hurt the companys ability to compete overseas prime is 
the leading seller of computer aided designcomputer aided 
manufacture systems in europe and second worldwide according to 
company spokesman richard eckel 
nick pasquarosa representing polaroid employees said the stakes 
could not be higher since both companies are in danger of being 
absorbed through takeovers and disappearing in their current form

president bushs quickness in dealing with the 
savings and loan crisis which is felt most acutely in texas met 
with praise monday from several of the states troubled thrifts 
we were pleased to hear that he bush made a concerted effort 
to study the problem to come up with a proposal and announce it 
today said russ cobler a spokesman for san antonio savings 
association one of 350 thrifts the presidents plan is designed to 
help 
bush called for an increase in the insurance premium banks and 
savings and loans pay on deposits and more money for the department 
of justice to pursue fraud in the thrift industry the plan does not 
include a fee on depositors but the increased cost of insurance for 
deposits likely will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower 
interest rates on savings accounts 
we like the fact that its not hitting the consumer directly 
said sam hart a spokesman for first gibraltar bank fsb the giant 
thrift recently formed through the consolidation of five texas 
savings and loans 
hart said first gibraltar viewed bushs plan as a move in a 
positive direction but added the companys officers were still 
looking it over 
first gibraltar was formed in one of the largest consolidations 
of the southwest plan the federal home loan bank boards program to 
cleanse the thrift industry of its most troubled institutions 
through a series of consolidations and recapitalizations 
at the fhlbbs dallas office a focal point for administration of 
much of the southwest plan spokesman david colgren said i really 
cant comment on the presidents plan until weve had a chance to 
look at it 
san antonio savings cobler praised bushs assurance that 
deposits in the nations thrifts are safe 
we are pleased that he very strongly at the beginning and end 
of the press conference spoke of the full faith and credit of 
government behind thrifts cobler said 
cobler said employees of his thrift in recent weeks have noted 
a lot of confusion by the consumer 
they dont necessarily know the full story about whats 
happening to savings and loans he said theyre concerned about 
taxes they see headlines about failed institutions what we hear 
from our customer is that theres a lot of confusion out there

consumers arent likely to see cuts in the 
interest they earn on their savings if president bushs plan to bail 
out the savings and loan industry is enacted top executives of 
several california thrifts said monday 
thats because the thrift industry faces too much competition 
from within and from banks and securities brokers to risk scaring 
away depositors by passing along a proposed increase in federal 
deposit insurance premiums 
when people say are they going to pass this premium on to the 
public i have to laugh said marion sandler president and chief 
executive officer of world savings amp loan association of oakland 
were not a costplus industry were going to have to eat it 
top officers at four other big california thrifts great 
western california federal glendale federal and home federal 
said they too were extremely unlikely to cut their interest rates 
for fear of losing depositors to banks mutual funds or the stock 
market all five thrifts are among the nations 10 largest 
robert adelizzi president and chief executive officer of home 
federal savings amp loan of san diego said it is inevitable that 
higher insurance bills would be taken out of thrifts profits 
rather that passed on in the form of lower interest rates and higher 
fees to depositors 
if we were a monopoly yes but were not adelizzi said 
were competing with a broad variety of investment alternatives 
and its real hard for us to just raise our rates or lower our 
rates 
the sampl executives reserved judgment on parts of bushs proposal 
but were generally supportive of the plan which would split the 
burden of bailing out failing thrifts among taxpayers and the 
industry itself 
the presidents plan would finance thrift bailouts with a 
combination of government bond sales with tax money financing the 
interest and increased premiums paid by both sampls and banks for 
their federal insurance 
the fact that both banks and sampls would pay higher insurance 
premiums inevitably would force down interest rates paid to 
consumers said jj pinola chairman and chief executive officer of 
first interstate bancorp one of californias biggest banks he 
called the decision unfair 
im somewhat appalled and looking for the right word to 
describe why someone in another industry that had nothing to do with 
the mistakes of the first industry now is being asked to pay 
pinola said its simply a bashing of the banks 
in general thrift executives praised the new president for 
quickly tackling a problem that many have seen as a crisis for four 
years 
i like what is see said james montgomery chairman and chief 
executive officer of beverly hillsbased great western financial 
corp i think hes showing some leadership saying weve got to 
get on with this problem and spreading the pain around a little 
bit 
montgomery and other thrift executives were particularly 
supportive of proposals to increase capital requirements the 
amount of a thrifts own money that must be used to back deposits 
and to crack down on fraud and mismanagement 
that is because many at strong thrifts believe they unfairly have 
received a black eye through association with the estimated 
onethird of the industry thats on shaky ground

compensate asbestos victims could run out of money by later this 
year causing delays in payments to thousands of claimants

the fund is running out of money because settlement payments have 
averaged about 50 percent higher and settlements have been reached 
at a quicker rate than expected when the fund was established 
according to court documents and officials quoted in tuesdays 
editions of the new york times 
its not as bleak a situation as it appears said david t 
austern the trusts general counsel but if we run out of money 
it means that we will be temporarily unable to make payments

could be filed against the trust the newspaper stated 
court documents and people involved in manvilles legal 
proceedings indicated that the trust in recent months had agreed to 
settle almost 14000 claims averaging 38000 each creators of the 
trust had estimated claims would average 25000 
in a report recently filed in us bankruptcy court in manhattan 
manville trustees stated they expected that in the third or fourth 
quarter of this year the trust will recurringly find itself 
temporarily unable to pay claimants 
trust officials told the times they could not predict how long 
payments might be delayed 
the trust is to be replenished periodically over 27 years by the 
sale of stock note payments and injections of manville profits 
mostly after 1982 
the fund currently has 685 million in assets and more than 665 
million in liabilities according to al kamhi the trusts director 
of communications the trusts total value was expected to exceed 
25 billion over its life

131 billion in the fourth quarter because of a 13 billion charge 
for costs of its chapter 11 reorganization
