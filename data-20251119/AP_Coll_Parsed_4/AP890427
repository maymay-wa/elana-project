the federal inspector who oversees united 
airlines boeing 747 fleet testified thursday he had not been aware 
the airline had a problem with a cargo door that later blew off in 
flight killing nine passengers 
inspector george batiza also said the federal aviation 
administration had failed to ensure that united complied with a 
federal rule that took effect last july 1 requiring airlines to 
inspect cargo doors after they were manually operated because of 
electrical problems 
testimony on the final day of a threeday hearing into the 
accident held by the national transportation safety board also 
centered on boeings design for the door but the hearing failed to 
unearth any definite cause for the accident 
on wednesday the airline testified that it was unaware of the 
faas inspection rule and was not in compliance for about nine 
months 
but by coincidence company mechanics made a partial inspection 
of the illfated cargo door in late december two months before the 
feb 24 disaster a united executive said thursday the inspection 
followed repairs made to the door which had failed to open and 
close electrically 
i am convinced the check verified that the door was 
working said robert doll united vice president for technical 
services 
he added however that the inspection was not as thorough as 
the federal aviation administration required under the new rule 
batiza testified that he was unaware of the repairs at the time 
and had not found any deficiencies in uniteds maintenance program 
recently 
ray ramakis manager of aircraft maintenance for the faa 
testified later that agency inspectors were required to review rule 
changes with airlines to see if airline plans for responding to the 
changes were adequate 
ramakis declined to comment when asked to explain how batiza 
who oversees uniteds 31plane 747 fleet could not know that 
united was failing to follow the new rule 
another faa inspector robert sanchez said thursday he was 
unaware that united was using power tools to operate some cargo 
doors despite recommendations from boeing not to do so for fear of 
damaging the mechanisms 
sanchez who oversees maintenance for uniteds entire 412plane 
fleet said he was unaware until just a few weeks ago that the 
company had received faa approval to use the power tools 
the ntsb hearing was being held to gather evidence on why the 
door and part of the fuselage tore off united flight 811 as the 747 
was climbing to 23000 feet nine passengers were sucked out of the 
plane over the pacific ocean 85 miles southwest of honolulu as the 
plane headed for australia 
speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking 
mechanism of the cargo door which remains on the bottom of the 
pacific ocean the ntsb has not decided whether to retrieve it 
boeing was sharply criticized by an accident investigator for 
the air line pilots association for insisting 747 cargo doors are 
safe despite two incidents since 1987 of the doors opening in 
midflight 
a door on a pan am flight out of london partially opened in 1987 
and the plane had to return to london with no loss of life no 
definite cause has ever been established for that incident 
we cannot explain the pan american incident and we have the 
united accident where the door failed but we steadfastly are 
saying the door is safe capt douglas robinson of alpa 
complained 
boeing engineering manager james fitzgerald spent two hours in 
the witness chair defending the design and operation of the cargo 
door which has been the main focus of the investigation 
i dont know how the door came open fitzgerald said i 
dont want to speculate on how it happened 
under questioning fitzgerald told the ntsb that boeing had not 
done projections on the effect of cargodoor openings in midflight 
you had no idea what would happen when the door came off 
the airplane an incredulous robinson asked 
the doors are not designed to come off the airplane 
fitzgerald replied we had no way of knowing exactly what would 
happen if a door came open in flight

the president of rite aid corp the nations 
largest retail pharmacy chain was arrested thursday on charges of 
paying a 33000 bribe to a state pharmacy board member 
authorities said 
martin grass allegedly was videotaped saying the money was 
intended to induce the board member to quit so a replacement of 
rite aids choosing could be appointed by the administration of 
gov richard celeste prosecutors said 
assistant cuyahoga county prosecutor william caine said grass 
also promised the pharmacy board member family medical insurance 
for four years if the member signed an undated resignation letter 
rite aid in a statement said the arrest stemmed from a 
vendetta by the pharmacy board against rite aid and said the 
payment by check reflected money legally owed by the chain to the 
board member 
a spokesman for the governor denied celeste intended to appoint 
a pharmacy board member who would be supportive of rite aid which 
is based in shiremanstown pa 
the prosecutors office did not identify the target of the 
alleged bribe attempt but rite aid said grass met with board member 
melvin wilczynski of toledo who declined to comment on the 
allegations 
caine said grass brought six drafts of an undated resignation 
letter one of which the board member signed and suggested that 
the board member retire between june and october 
well let you know caine quoted grass as telling the 
board member with regard to the effective date of the resignation 
the pharmacy board is made up of eight voting members appointed 
to staggered fouryear terms by the governor subject to senate 
confirmation the executive director only votes to break ties 
grass was charged with bribery and was freed after posting 10 
percent of his 100000 surety bond his attorney john s pyle 
declined comment 
garry south celestes communications director said the 
governor knew nothing about the matter 
he the governor has never heard of the guy grass south 
said he is either using the governor for cover or using too many 
drugs from his own drug store 
suzanne mead assistant vice president for corporate 
communications for rite aid said the charge was totally without 
merit and the payment in question was made in satisfaction of a 
contract between a pharmacist who also is an ohio pharmacy board 
member and peoples drugstores his former employer 
she said rite aid acquired the lane drug division of peoples 
drugstores on april 10 and was liable for the payment under the 
contract the payment was made in settlement of the contract and 
was legal she said

members of his team were frequenting a bar where drug trafficking 
is common

a federal appeals court spurning charges of 
reverse discrimination affirmed an agreement thursday that calls 
for the government to promote 240 black civilian workers at robins 
air force base 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld a consent degree 
issued by us district judge wilbur owens that also required the 
government to pay 375 million in back pay to 3200 black 
civilians who were employed at the base between 1972 and 1979 
the agreement reached in 1984 on a lawsuit filed in 1975 was 
one of the largest discrimination settlements in air force history 
the threejudge appeals panel agreed with owens that black 
civilian workers were entitled to the promotions because of past 
discrimination at the base near warner robins about 100 miles 
south of atlanta 
the appeals court earlier had ordered owens to allow a group of 
white and nonminority employees called the warner robins 
constitutional rights fund to intervene in the lawsuit and 
challenge the promotions that group had challenged owens decision 
in october 1987 to reaffirm the 1984 decree 
the court ruled on an appeal by the fund upholding the consent 
decree and saying the interveners had failed to present any 
evidence that the decree would have hurt their own chances for 
promotion 
robert t poss president of the warner robins constitutional 
rights fund said in a telephone interview that the group would 
discuss the ruling before deciding whether to appeal future 
but he added we thought from the beginning it would be a 
case that would have to be decided by the supreme court 
thursdays opinion written by circuit judge charles clark 
noted that 169 promotions were granted to blacks under the decree 
between december 1984 and october 1986 and that those promotions 
comprised only 43 percent of the promotions made at warner 
robins during that period of time 
the court noted that the decree was narrowly written so the 
promotions were made only to 38 target positions to which the 
original black plaintiffs had demonstrated that black employees 
were promoted in proportions less than their representation in the 
work force or in lower grades 
clark wrote that the white and nonminority employees did not 
present any evidence that any one of them otherwise eligible for a 
target position was denied that position 
robins air force base spokesman dale brinkman said thursday 
night that base officials had not had time to study the courts 
ruling so it was premature for me to make any statement on it

as he was finishing an emergency appendectomy dr 
james w turner noticed what he throught was a stray thread on the 
surgical drapes then it wiggled 
the thread was actually a 2inchlong skinny red worm slithering 
out of the patients incision it was a fish worm inadvertently 
eaten by the patient in sushi the night before 
the patient was undergoing the operation for abdominal pain but 
doctors believe the worm was the real cause of his misery 
the incident described in todays new england journal of 
medicine is an uncomfortable reminder of the potential danger of 
eating raw fish noted dr peter m schantz of the us centers 
for disease control in atlanta 
raw fish in sushi and sashimi has become popular with the spread 
of japanese restaurants in the united states but health experts 
say most cases of worm infection occur when people prepare raw fish 
at home experienced sushi chefs are good at spotting wormy fish so 
it doesnt reach customers 
in the latest case the victim ate raw fish at a friends home 
in new york city 
he looked like anybody else with appendicitis recalled 
turner a surgeon at booth memorial hospital i operated and 
much to my chagrin the appendix was normal i was getting ready to 
close the abdomen and i see this little thing and it looks like 
its moving 
i said wait a minute theres something wrong ill be 
damned its a worm 
the astonished doctors sent the worm to albert einstein college 
of medicine where it was identified as a larval nematode known as 
eustrongylides 
there is a clear danger involved in eating raw fish this 
underscores that danger said dr murray wittner an einstein 
parasitologist 
the adult form of eustrongylides is a parasite of fisheating 
birds while the larvae are found in the flesh of fish that live in 
brackish and fresh water 
in an editorial in the journal schantz noted that only four 
other cases of human infection with a nematode have been reported 
all were fishermen who swallowed bait minnows whole a practice 
not likely to be widely imitated 
the worms most commonly acquired from raw seafood are larvae of 
the family anisakidae between 25 and 50 us cases have been 
documented but experts believe most cases are not recognized or 
reported to health officials 
the worms often pass harmlessly through the digestive system or 
are coughed up a few hours after the meal doctors have even 
described a condition known as tingling throat syndrome which 
occurs when the worms get stuck in the back of the throat 
sometimes however the worms burrow into the wall of the 
stomach or the intestines they must be removed with a tube thats 
pushed down the victims throat 
schantz noted that many commercial fish are commonly infected 
with worms these include mackerel herring rockfish salmon and 
cod the parasites also are more common in fish from the pacific 
ocean than from the atlantic 
the number of worm infections is increasing in the united 
states but schantz doubts that this will ever become a major 
health problem since most americans still prefer their fish 
cooked which kills the worms

a libyan air force officer split away from a 
fivehelicopter squadron flying to sudan landed his craft in 
southern egypt and requested asylum a senior security source said 
the incident wednesday was the fourth defectionmotivated 
landing by libyan military aircraft in egypt in just over two 
years relations between egypt and libya have been badly strained 
since 1972 
the security source speaking by telephone from the southern 
provincial capital of aswan identified the officer as maj fathi 
miloud alsaghir 26 
he said elsaghir landed his sovietmade helicopter about 62 
miles south of aswan and told egyptian officers he wanted asylum 
because he opposed participation in military operations in southern 
sudan and was unhappy with the regime of libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi 
libya has been giving military aid to the sudanese government of 
prime minister sadek mahdi to fight a 6yearold rebellion in three 
southern regions 
libyanegyptian relations soured in 1972 after cairo spurned a 
bid by gadhafi for immediate merger of the two countries 
five years later the two countries fought a fiveday border war 
after a series of bombings in egyptian cities that cairo blamed on 
libyan agents relations chilled further after gadhafi denounced 
egypt for signing a peace treaty with israel in 1979 
libya expelled more than 40000 egyptian workers in 1986 but 
tens of thousands of egyptians continue to work there

bootes has been thrust from obscurity and named the 
astrophysical symbol of the french revolution bicentennial 
hundreds of people toasted the new twinkling symbol with 
champagne at the paris observatory at sunset wednesday and peered

jeannoel jeanneney head of the commission planning the 
festivities marking the revolutions 200th birthday said choosing 
an official star showed the poetic side of the celebration 
gamma boo also known as seginus was chosen because it is the 
brightest of several stars that are roughly 200 lightyears from 
earth light now reaching earth would have left the star at about 
the time parisians were storming the bastille prison in july 1789

president bushs mass media adviser for the 1988 
presidential race denied wednesday that his campaign strategy and 
tactics were dirty or too negative 
look at trash tv look at the lines blurring between tabloid 
journalism and journalism look at the garbage that is out there in 
general said roger ailes a panelist at a seminar on the 
presidency in the 90s at fordham university 
i would submit that the political campaigns are among the 
cleanest things on television today ailes said 
nbc news commentator john chancellor who moderated the seminar 
said that since presidential candidates are spending public money 
about 41 million each in 1988 we ought to have some say in how 
they spend it 
jeff greenfield political and media adviser for abc news 
defended political advertising as admittedly a short and clumsy 
way to get to know a candidate yet even within those limits you 
pick up something 
kathleen hall jamieson an expert on presidential politics from 
the university of texas at austin suggested a nonpartisan panel be 
instituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairness 
and accuracy 
and while some may complain that the presidential campaign drags 
on i dont know what you can do about the process being too long 
short of legislating it and that would just drive it underground 
like booze he said 
ron brown chairman of the democratic national committee 
suggested that allowing the political parties a bigger role in 
selecting candidates might produce more leaders on a par with the 
great presidents of years past 
there are people who believe when it comes to selecting 
candidates for president that you use participatory democracy to 
its fullest extent in a general election but that there are other 
ways that parties ought to select candidates brown said 
certainly no changes are going to be made by 1992 but it 
certainly isnce because there are too many imponderables in 
making a successful campaign 
brown said that negative campaigning was one of the factors that 
turn people off and keep them away from the polls on election day 
greenfield said he believed the role of television was vastly 
exaggerated even with the skills of media gurus like ailes 
you run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent unemployment and you 
have a very different result he predicted 
greenfield a former speech writer for sen robert kennedy also 
criticized the level of public discourse the campaigns have reached 
every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of the 
debate he said whether its jesse jackson and his working 
poor litany or george bushs acceptance speech at the republican 
convention you can feel the public almost come alive say more 
please give us more 
at a later seminar wednesday night pollster louis harris said 
he believed that presidents should turn to public opinion polls 
after they confront the issues and make a decision 
but he pointed out our polling is either victimized or a 
reflection of what is reported theres no question about it and 
television is the most powerful medium 
cbs white house correspondent lesley stahl said televisions 
coverage of issues is dependent like it or not on the president 
presenting them in a simplified manner 
if they want to communicate what their policies and their 
thoughts and their decisions are to the american people over 
television they simply must learn how to simplify it she said 
she also noted that bush has not been getting his message out as 
well as president reagan or even as well as he did during the 
campaign 
presidents win support in these times not because the public 
agrees with them on their ideology or their policies or on 
substantive issues but because they come to like them over 
television she said 
reagan became adored by the public because the white house 
manipulated very brilliantly the media with staged events and 
photo opportunities she said bush has not done that she said 
adding i kind of respect it but its not doing him any good 
the seminars at fordham in manhattan were part of the citys 
commemoration of the bicentennial of george washingtons 
presidential inauguration

she never knew how great she was 
amid the blimpsize egos of the entertainment world lucille 
ball stood out like an orange beacon she never bragged she never 
exercised her considerable power she always seemed astonished 
even embarrassed when honors inevitably came her way 
when she was to receive a humanitarian award from variety clubs 
on a cbs special five years ago she told me there comes a time 
in your life when you get a lot of plaques its very flattering 
and ill go along with it especially if it benefits children 
whenever she was praised for i love lucy she invariably 
replied well all of the credit should go to writers madelyn 
pugh and bob carroll jr or desi was a genius he was 
responsible for the shows success or she cited costars desi 
vivian vance and bill frawley 
yes the writing and producing and casting of i love lucy 
were marvelous but lucys performance added the quantum force her 
inspired pantomime could be written by no one the growing panic as 
the chocolate assembly line speeded up her catalog of pained 
expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating 
unlike many stars lucille ball rarely indulged in 
selfanalysis but on one occasion she revealed why her feelings 
about the i love lucy triumph might have been ambivalent 
living through the last five years of the show she said took 
the edge off any enjoyment i might have had desis drinking and 
carousing were a terrible embarrassment bad for a womans 
selfesteem the talk around town was poor lucy because i 
couldnt face people i became a recluse for more than 5 years 
i never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio and 
actually working together was a blessing desi had everything so 
well organized that it was easy to do the work 
lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential she was 40 when 
i love lucy started on cbs and revolutionized television and 
although she spent many years in hollywood none of the studios 
ever designed comedies for me the way mgm did for red skelton 
paramount did for bob hope and sam goldwyn did for danny kaye 
she once said 
television was the medium for me the medium for anyone who 
wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half 
for a movie to come out she said in an interview late in life 
television is an instant barometer especially the way we did it 
it was all new nobody knew anything about television nobody 
was there to say no dont do that its wrong we never knew 
what was wrong and what was right we were all feeling our way 
desi was very innovative and very showmanshipconscious and was 
very intent on going ahead and doing it that sounds all right 
lets go so we went 
always the credit to someone else but millions upon millions of 
television watchers know otherwise

when 200 officers in riot gear came to 
arrest protest organizer zviad gamsakhurdia two weeks ago they 
stormed over the walls of his home actually a museum to his 
poetfather 
and when the heavily armed officers returned to search the 
premises they were stymied outside for four hours because 
gamsakhurdias 9yearold son refused to open the door when he was 
home alone 
gamsakhurdia 50 is one of georgias most prominent dissidents 
who helped organize demonstrations that ended april 9 in a bloody 
confrontation between troops and protesters at least 20 people 
died in the unrest 
one of the southern republics most prominent activists he is 
following the example of his late father konstantin a revered 
writer who was involved in creating the independent republic of 
georgia that existed from 1918 to 1921 
after the government confiscated some of his fathers earnings 
six years ago his son persuaded authorities to use the disputed 
funds to renovate the family home into a housemuseum showcasing 
konstantins life 
the leaky roof and old linoleum are gone according to zviads 
wife manana the family now lives in spacious rooms with carved 
wooden shutters and a sweeping staircase 
mrs gamsakhurdia said in an interview tuesday that her husband 
is still being held and she has not been allowed to see him or 
heard from him since 
gamsakhurdia helped start the series of demonstrations that 
culminated in the april 9 tragedy when he went on a hunger strike 
march 11 with a list of 20 demands many of the demands involved 
ethnic issues such as vandalism of an antique church allegedly by 
southern ossetians and antigeorgian discrimination in abkhazia a 
region of georgia on the black sea 
but in seeking a resolution to these disputes he drew 
accusations that he was inciting ethnic tensions himself 
by the end of march abkhazians were holding mass meetings to 
complain about discrimination against them by georgians the 
tbilisi demonstrations started as a response to the abkhazian 
demands for secession from georgia and evolved into a mass call 
for georgias secession from the soviet union 
on april 9 protesters helped gamsakhurdia and other organizers 
escape the tbilisi clash because they assumed the leaders were the 
targets of the soldiers said mrs gamsakhurdia 
at 6 am that day gamsakhurdia was at tbilisi state 
university organizing a general strike mrs gamsakhurdia said 
at 830 am about 200 officers of the kgb the interior 
ministry and police descended on the family home in a neighborhood 
of antique meandering streets and scaled the 12foothigh brick 
wall rather than ring the bell mrs gamsakhurdia said they had no 
arrest warrant nothing at all she said 
the officers donned riot gear burst through a door attacked 
her husband and dragged him off to jail she said 
the officers did not damage the shrine of books photographs and 
memorabilia of gamsakhurdias father and his involvement in 
georgias heady three years as an independent nation but in the 
garden the officers uprooted the crosses on the graves of 
konstantin his wife and daughter 
why do they do that to dead people mrs gamsakhurdia asked 
when the police returned april 15 for a search only to be put 
off by the 9yearold mrs gamsakhurdia called the communist party 
headquarters of georgia she said she threatened to release to the 
world press a photograph of the troops swarming over her home if 
such actions did not halt 
on april 20 her home was searched by just four officials she 
said 
mrs gamsakhurdia says she does not believe new georgian 
communist party chief givi gumbaridze when he says he wants a 
dialogue with opponents to replace the traditional party monologue 
they still dont want a dialogue she said if officials 
really wanted to talk with her husband and other activists they 
would release them from prison she said 
she also noted that her husbands 20 demands have never been 
published in the local press but soviet tv ran daily reports last 
year on an american hunger striker in front of the white house 
gamsakhurdias other demands include halting construction of the 
transcaucasian railway and several hydroelectric dams closure of 
the polluting oil refinery at batumi on the black sea return of 
the deported meskhetian minority from central asia to their 
homeland in georgia and restoration of universitylevel georgian 
studies programs 
authorities have taken action on only one of his 20 demands 
conversion of the metekhi chapel from a concert hall to a place of 
worship his wife said

barbara bush has called on the nations newspaper 
publishers to step up their efforts to fight illiteracy 
we know the job of building a literate america is far from 
done and newspapers have a crucial role to play the first lady 
told an audience of about 1000 gathered at the american newspaper 
publishers associations 103rd annual convention on wednesday 
mrs bushs talk came on the final day of the threeday meeting 
which president bush addressed monday 
mrs bush plans to direct much attention to the nations 
literacy problems during her husbands presidency 
tens of millions of americans will never pick up a 
newspaper and that has obvious implications for the industry 
she told the publishers 
she said one of the main thrusts of literacy programs should be 
family literacy where it all begins 
parents are their childrens first role models and 
illiterate parents are likely to raise children who cannot read or 
write the first lady said 
to break this cycle of despair we have to establish literacy 
as a value in every american family 
she gave several examples of disadvantaged people across the 
country who with the help of literacy programs have gotten off 
welfare and continued their educations 
one woman evelyn vega 29 of stamford conn was a 
thirdgeneration welfare mother who learned to read and got off 
public aid last year with the help of a united way literacy program 
these are the stories of struggle and triumph that newspapers 
nationwide have used to mobilize literacy efforts mrs bush said 
newspapers also should look within their own ranks in tackling 
the problem she said citing the case of a typesetter at a 
washington dc publication who could not read what she 
produced 
the woman is an example of people who learn to cope and mask 
their reading problems but still must be helped mrs bush said 
los angeles times publisher tom johnson who spoke after the 
first lady cited his newspapers efforts as an example of what the 
industry can do to address the problem 
the times has organized a literacy program that includes centers 
where children and their parents can learn to read johnson said 
no profession is more affected by illiteracy than ours he 
said the future of newspapers depends on the ability of our 
citizens to read 
johnson urged his colleagues to take part in an allout 
national campaign against illiteracy together he said we can 
make a difference

beards an ancient badge of wisdom and 
virility are vanishing from the halls of congress but a few of 
the house members who are still sporting chin whiskers and proud 
of it gathered to keep the faith 
therell always be beards said rep david e bonior 
dmich the undaunted chairman of the house beard caucus whose 
members convened in the house barber shop wednesday to count noses 
and admire each others facial adornments 
only two others showed up reps mickey leland dtexas and 
dana rohrabacher rcalif the two remaining members reps ron 
dellums dcalif and floyd flake dny sent their regrets 
the dwindling ranks of the beard caucus down to only five 
members from about a dozen last year surely make it one of the 
smallest and least influential specialinterest groups on capitol 
hill 
indeed rep gary ackerman dny says with a laugh that he 
recently shaved off his distinctive goatee which hed worn for 17 
years when i discovered there was no pac political action 
committee that was interested in the beard caucus 
bonior who also is chief deputy whip for house democrats says 
the caucus is a fun group that meets anytime we can get a 
photographer to come and give us some free publicity its sole 
purpose he says is to allow members to fraternize about the 
politics of having hair on your face 
bonior confessed that he shaved off his 10yearold beard 
briefly during the christmas holidays my family hadnt seen me 
for 10 years so i shaved they didnt like what they saw so i 
grew it back he said 
beards may not be an endangered species as bonior claims but 
they have fallen on hard times washington is full of earnest 
cleanshaven yuppies the senate hasnt seen a beard since philip 
a hart the liberal democrat from michigan died in 1976 there 
hasnt been a bearded president since benjamin harrison left office 
in 1893 
in the turbulent sixties beards enjoyed a brief renaissance as 
symbols of antiwar liberalism but bonior says they are a 
nonideological growth today 
bonior might be right although he dellums flake and leland 
are all liberal democrats the bearded rohrabacher is a staunch 
reagan conservative who won a house seat last november with active 
campaign support from irancontra defendant oliver l north 
the experts told me that if i had any chance of winning i had 
to shave my beard and stay away from ollie north i refused to do 
either and i won rohrabacher said 
another conservative california republican rep robert k 
dornan shaved off his beard and won reelection handily but when 
liberal former rep mike lowry dwash tried the same trick in 
his bid for a senate seat last fall he lost 
i had my beard for six years lowry said in a telephone 
interview from seattle where he is teaching college and 
reassessing his political future 
i had it so long i was becoming identified with it i was 
tired of being a yasser arafat lookalike also my mother hated 
it 
rep sam gejdenson dconn shaved a beard hed worn for six 
months last year during that time i got more nasty mail over my 
beard than over any other issue since ive been in congress he 
said generally they didnt like the way it looked or thought 
it was unclean 
gejdenson who intends to grow a new beard believes the rise 
and fall of their popularity has some mysterious connection with 
the economy 
when the stock market goes down there are more beards and 
when the market goes up there are fewer beards he observes 
when i showed up for the 101st congress i was cleanshaven and 
the economy was back up again

the future of abortion in america will be on 
the supreme courts discussion agenda when its nine members gather 
for a closeddoor conference friday morning 
first item must the court in resolving an abortionregulation 
controversy from missouri plunge into its landmark 1973 decision 
that women have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies 
although chief justice william h rehnquist may conduct an 
initial vote friday and begin the opinionwriting process the 
courts final decision likely will not be announced until late june 
or early july 
missouri officials and the bush administration are urging the 
court to overturn or curtail the 16yearold ruling in roe vs 
wade and while speculating about the supreme courts direction is 
always tricky business questions from the bench in wednesdays 
argument session indicated three key justices may be willing to 
undertake a broad review of abortion rights 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m 
kennedy all appointees of former president reagan pointedly 
asked lawyers for both sides about the dimensions of abortion 
rights 
do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether to 
have a child or not a right to procreate oconnor asked the 
administrations lawyer do you deny that the constitution 
protects that right 
scalia asked the lawyer representing opponents of the missouri 
law how can you derive a fundamental right without making a 
determination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not 
the justice added it is very hard to say it just as a matter 
of basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless you 
make the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a 
human life 
kennedy asked the administrations lawyer about a 1965 supreme 
court decision striking down a state law that barred use of 
contraceptives the high courts first enunciation of the 
constitutional privacy right which served as the basis for roe 
vs wade 
does the 1965 case stand for the proposition that there is a 
right to determine whether to procreate kennedy asked 
of the justices considered strong supporters of abortion rights 
harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood marshall and john 
paul stevens only stevens participated fully in the session 
brennan asked one question blackmun and marshall none 
rehnquist and justice byron r white dissenters in and 
consistent critics of roe vs wade each asked several questions 
but seemed intent on giving the three junior justices as much time 
as they needed 
their questions could have zeroed in on the particulars of the 
missouri laws regulations many of them did not 
the court however still could resolve the missouri case 
without reconsidering roe vs wade 
such a decision still would be read as a barometer of the 
current justices commitment to the 1973 ruling but might not 
affect many women outside missouri higher stakes would be left for 
a future case 
but the possibility exists for a broader ruling one that 
includes in its scope a nation in which 15 million legal abortions 
are performed each year

the united states and soviet union traded 
charges of hypocrisy lying and bad faith in a blistering finale to 
three weeks of debate on afghanistan in the security council 
the meeting adjourned wednesday without resolution and no 
further meeting was scheduled 
the debate marked the first fullfledged council discussion of 
afghanistan since january 1980 right after soviet troops 
intervened in afghanistan replacing one marxist government with 
another and staying on to help fight a moslem insurrection 
the session began april 11 and included more than 40 speakers 
all of them calling for a political settlement and 
selfdetermination by the afghan people 
ambassador patricia byrne us representative to the council 
told delegates wednesday it is the height or should i say the 
depth of hypocrisy for the representative of the soviet union to 
claim that the regimes in kabul and the ussr are fulfilling 
their obligations under the geneva accords of april 14 1988 and 
that the united states and pakistan have failed to do so 
the truth is precisely the opposite distortion and 
falsehood will not work 
the whole world knows full well who created the dreadful 
situation by its invasion of afghanistan the soviet union has at 
least withdrawn its troops but it is seeking to lay the blame for 
the chaos and continued suffering at the feet of others 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov earlier delivered an 
extensive and stinging rebuke to the united states for arming the 
afghan guerrillas with weapons transported across the border from 
pakistan 
the world community has formed a very clear idea about who 
is hypocritical and who has been lying in this hall he said 
jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis 
referring to us arms being supplied to the rebels through 
pakistan belonogov gibed we dont believe babies are borne by 
storks or come from cabbage patches so how did these arms from the 
territory of pakistan get there into afghanistan 
did they fall out of the sky or were they brought by some 
other force 
neither the united states nor pakistan admitted supplying 
weapons including stinger and blowpipe missiles and other arms to 
afghan guerrillas 
the united states is not setting the best example of respect 
for international agreements belonogov said during an hourlong 
statement 
by supplying the afghan opposition with weapons on pakistani 
territory the united states has thereby been pushing pakistan 
toward a violation of the bilateral agreement between pakistan and 
afghanistan 
that unmediated agreement between the two west asian 
neighbors guaranteed by washington and moscow calls for 
noninterference in domestic affairs of pakistan and afghanistan 
it also provided for the soviet troop withdrawal completed in 
february 
afghanistan and the soviet union say pakistan violated the 
accords by arming and training afghan rebels in pakistan and 
sending them into afghanistan along with weapons convoys they 
claim the pakistani military intelligence units logistics 
officers and militia are involved both directly and indirectly 
in fighting within afghanistan 
pakistan denies it and says soviet supply of weapons to the 
kabul regime has continued the warfare and suffering in 
afghanistan most afghans reject the marxist government in kabul 
pakistan says 
pakistani ambassador s shah nawaz said in response to an afghan 
threat of retaliation issued in the council monday that his 
government will defend itself against any aggression from its 
neighbor

island of madagascar on friday where opposition parties have 
declared a papal truce following violent antigovernment 
protests 
the pope later will go on the french indian ocean island of 
reunion to zambia and finally to malawi on his nineday trip his 
fifth to africa as pope and the 41st foreign pilgrimage of his 
10year papacy 
the visit comes seven months after his tour of five southern 
african countries and underlines john pauls emphasis on the 
fastest growing segment of the roman catholic church the vatican 
counts 75 million adherents in africa and expects the number to 
reach 100 million by the turn of the century 
among issues he is expected to address are human rights aids 
apartheid in south africa foreign debt the environment the 
shortage of priests and the process of adapting african traditions 
to a faith imported from europe 
in a papal first john paul will fly on the concorde although 
the air france jetliner that will take him from reunion to zambia 
will not travel at supersonic speed because of the shortness of the 
trip 
madagascar a 235000squaremile island off southeast africa 
has been the scene of turbulent demonstrations against the 
government of president didier ratsiraka who has been in power 
since 1975 and was reelected last month to a third sevenyear term 
at least five people have been killed and 74 wounded in the past 
week in demonstrations by opposition parties which accuse the 
government of rigging the election 
opposition leaders said tuesday they will suspend their 
demonstrations during the popes visit recognizing the work of 
john paul and the church in favor of democracy and the rights of 
man 
about 25 percent of madagascars 10 million people are catholic 
and the church has spoken out against some of ratsirakas policies 
vatican officials said the pope is expected to stress the need for 
respect of human rights and political freedoms in madagascar 
churchstate relations improved in recent years after ratsiraka 
turned from many of his socialist policies to gain western aid to 
tackle a severe economic crisis and protect the countrys unique 
plant and wildlife 
in reunion a french overseas territory where 90 percent of the 
500000 people are catholic john paul will be received by premier 
michel rocard of france in the capital st denis and address 
bishops from other indian ocean islands 
the pope is expected to raise the issue of apartheid in zambia 
a frontline state that provides headquarters in exile for the 
african national congress the main group fighting to end white 
domination in south africa 
in a major document released in february the vatican condemned 
apartheid south africas policy of racial segregation as the 
most systematic form of racism in the world 
vatican officials previewing the trip on the condition of 
anonymity said malawi could provide the pope the opportunity to 
address the problem of aids which is estimated to have stricken up 
to 20 percent of the male population 
in the past the pope has urged compassion for aids victims the 
vatican has condemned the use of condoms as a means of stopping the 
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome prescribing 
abstinence as the best means of avoiding the fatal disease 
malawi one of africas smallest and poorest nations has been 
strained by an influx of 650000 to 800000 refugees fleeing the 
civil war in neighboring mozambique the church is inviting the 
catholic refugees to attend the papal events 
the pope is scheduled to return to rome on may 6

brace yourself in the soviet union the cat is 
the hat 
but the good news is that not all soviets like felines turned 
into fedoras and in a kind of purrestroika members of a 
moscow cat club are in animalloving britain seeking advice on how 
to promote better treatment of their furry friends 
the position of homeless cats in the soviet union and in 
moscow is very difficult said nikolai nepomnyaschy vice 
chairman of the fauna club 
the sanitary inspectorate is very strict on homeless cats and 
they destroy a lot of them they poison them with different poisons 
and they make hats out of them nepomnyaschy said 
dogs are no better off 
its not just cats theyre after but also dogs 
nepomnyaschy said theyre very bad people even people who have 
been setting up cooperatives to make and sell cat hats 
such profitmaking cooperatives have become possible under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of perestroika or 
social and economic reforms 
while cruelty to cats is illegal in the soviet union its not 
against the law to make hats out of them nobody is actually 
going to punish you if you turn a cat into a hat nepomnyaschy 
said 
how did the problem start 
as we dont have a tradition of looking after cats some 
parents buy cats for their children simply as toys so it happens 
that children can play with the cats until they get tired of them 
and then they let them out into the street and parents dont say 
anything about it he said 
nepomnyaschy brought a film crew that is making a movie about 
cats they arrived tuesday and will stay until may 2 visiting cat 
rescue centers and talking to experts 
three or four years ago such contacts between our countries 
would not have been possible they probably would have said 
youre completely mad you cant do that nepomnyaschy said 
wednesday 
its only been possible since the process of perestroika 
starting in our country in 198586 
britain is the first noncommunist country the club has visited 
we couldnt have possibly not come to england because there 
are almost legends about how well people treat their pets 
nepomnyaschy said 
we were very pleased indeed that we were approached to ask if 
we would be willing to hold their hands a little said philip 
wood deputy chairman of britains cats protection league 
with uncharacteristic british immodesty he said we do have 
quite a good international reputation 
cats are increasingly popular in the soviet union where perhaps 
30 million people keep felines as pets nepomnyaschy said 
fauna club the soviet unions oldest and biggest cat club was 
established in 1986 and has attracted 1000 members its opening 
cat exhibit was attended by 80000 people he said 
and the cats they were queuing to see were just household 
cats he said 
the film is targeted at young people and will be shown in movie 
theaters and perhaps on television 
the film we are going to make is a continuation of this 
propaganda of the advertisement of cats said nikita voronov the 
films director and a fauna club member wed like to make a film 
that shows that everything alive has a right to life 
incidentally its not just tough being a cat in the soviet 
union owning one isnt easy either 
for starters theres no canned cat food said nepomnyaschya 
the club recommends boiled hake a kind of fish 
there also are no covered cat litter pans fitted plastic 
liners or mintscented cat litter soviets use plastic 
photodeveloping trays filled with paper or sand he said

why shouldnt a crack at the fattest jackpot in 
north america create a ticketbuying frenzy how else can you turn 
a one dollar lottery chance into a 100 million payoff 
the lure of great prizes fires people up theres a kick of 
anticipation said abe kramer a psychologist who counsels 
compulsive gamblers in new york city the bigger the prize the 
better even though they dont have a snowballs chance in hell of 
winning 
pennsylvanias super 7 lottery drawn wednesday night was worth 
more than 100 million the worlds largest prize outside spains 
159 million pot divvied up in last december 
the pennsylvania prize illustrates how popular lotteries have 
become since new hampshire opened its game in 1964 
lottery sales are expected to top 15 billion this year in 32 
states and the district of columbia up from an estimated 14 
billion last year sales in at least eight states exceed 1 billion 
the lottery is the poor mans stock market it lets you 
fantasize about the lifestyles of the rich and famous said j 
blaine lewis jr president of the north american association of 
state and provincial lotteries 
for 1 players of super 7 picked seven numbers from one to 80 
the winner must match them against 11 numbers drawn the official 
winning numbers were 06 16 24 34 35 37 40 41 45 60 71 
the odds of winning were 96 milliontoone and the pot grew 
because there was no winner for six weeks 
tickets were sold at a rate of 500 a second in a scene 
reminiscent of a gold rush rabid prospectors invaded pennsylvania 
by car bus and plane to queue up it was as if an entire state had 
gone mad 
its a dream the fantasy of getting rich of never having to 
work again said don baucum a professor of psychology at 
birminghamsouthern college in alabama people get to carry 
around a little extra glow

say players can spend their life savings or write bad checks to 
cover debts 
theres a dramatic increase in lottery addicts said valerie 
lorenz executive director of the national center for pathological 
gambling in baltimore 
gambling used to be immoral sinful and illegal associated 
with greed and crime the lotteries are promoting it as an act of 
civic responsibility because it supports education transportation 
and elderly programs she said 
lotteries were introduced as a way to raise money without 
raising taxes in a way of using a vice to fund a virtue lottery 
proceeds pay for senior citizens programs in pennsylvania 
education in ohio and california and economic development in iowa 
but states pocket an average of 35 percent of lottery sales and 
the games account for only a small percentage of a states budget 
the lottery is a rather inefficient and ineffective method of 
general revenue but nobody wants to raise taxes thats a dirty 
word said roy kaplan of the florida institute of technology who 
has studied state lotteries for 20 years 
i look at the lottery as the flip side of work gambling gives 
the tantalizing thought of achieving success without work kaplan 
said its an innocent diversion for a few days 
the sheer magnitude of a 100 million treasure and the chance 
to chase rainbows and get rich instantly has a strong american 
appeal but while a dollar may make you rich it can also cost you 
your privacy

eds leads with 8 grafs to update with latest returns comments

craig thomas gave the republican party its 
first victory of the spring by outdistancing democrat john vinich 
in the race for wyomings atlarge seat in the us house of 
representatives 
with 88 percent of the vote in and just 40 of the 334 precincts 
left to report unofficial returns gave thomas 60262 votes or 53 
percent and vinich had 49435 or 43 percent 
independent craig mccune received just 4475 votes while daniel 
johnson an independent who espoused white separatist views 
claimed just 413 
tonight the best man won guy vander jagt chairman of the 
national republican congressional committee said from his 
washington dc office craig thomas won the special election 
for wyomings congressional seat because he was a better candidate 
than john vinich 
vinich and the democrats started with enormous advantages in 
a campaign that was only 40 days long john vinich had a towering 
lead in name identification and had an established campaign 
organization that only five months ago nearly won a us senate 
seat 
before the polls closed howard schloss of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee complimented vinich for his 
campaign and touched on the democratic victories in indiana and 
alabama earlier this year 
our victories in indiana and alabama and our strong showing 
in the heavily republican state of wyoming proves two things he 
said one the voters have responded to the democratic message 
and vision for this country 
and two the republican strategy of divisiveness hate and 
gutter politics does not work and the people will not accept it 
from republican john rice waving the confederate flag in alabama to 
a republican pollster spreading lies about john vinich in wyoming 
the gop has proven and even flaunted their gutter tactics 
the special election was called to fill the house vacancy 
created last month when dick cheney resigned to become defense 
secretary 
at stake in the election was republican pride as the gop lost 
special elections in indiana and alabama earlier this year

cheneys move from the house to the bush cabinet gave democrats 
their best opportunity since 1978 to gain a seat on the 
congressional delegation 
the democrats fielded vinich who has spent 15 years in the 
legislature and almost upset sen malcolm wallop last november the 
gop countered with thomas who just won a third term in the state 
house of representatives 
the short campaign centered more on negative political 
portrayals than on specific philosophical differences both vinich 
and thomas boasted of being fiscally conservative in favor of 
multiple use of federal lands and concerned over health care 
issues 
both oppose gun control and voted in the legislature to restrict 
public funding of abortions 
both support an amendment to the us constitution that would 
let states restrict abortion however vinich has been quoted as 
saying abortion is a matter of personal choice 
thomas said he was the candidate who aligned best with sens 
wallop and alan simpson 
the basic choice will be whether the people want continuity of 
the conservative representation we have had or to move over to the 
left of center and send a liberal to represent the state of 
wyoming thomas said often during the campaign 
vinich denounced republican effors to paint him as a liberal 
tied to big labor and stressed that wyoming must be represented 
within the majority in congress 
i want to be part of a team that makes sure wyoming gets the 
best from both sides of the aisle from democrats and 
republicans he said 
the national republican congressional committee at one point 
seemed on the verge of torpedoing thomas campaign ed rollins a 
strategist hired to reverse gop fortunes early on declared that he 
was calling the shots for thomas 
vinich used those comments to charge that thomas a 56yearold 
businessman had lost control of his campaign the 38yearold 
democrat also scored the republicans for a telephone poll that 
implied vinich was a liar 
thomas countered by noting that the bulk of vinichs campaign 
contributions came from outofstate labor groups he portrayed the 
democrat as beholden to organized labor with little wyoming support

millions of homeowners hire companies to treat 
their lawns but most states make no attempt to assure that workers 
are properly trained and that precautions are taken against 
chemical poisoning says a public interest group 
public citizen a private environmental and consumer 
organization says its national survey found far too few state laws 
and regulations aimed at protecting public health from hazards 
posed by lawn care chemicals 
as a result millions of americans may be unwittingly exposed 
to potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards said 
laura weiss who wrote public citizens report on the survey 
for example the report said nearly twothirds of the states 
have no requirement for either training or testing lawn care 
employees twothirds do not require that customers be provided 
with information on potential hazards of the chemicals used only a 
handful require notice before a lawn is treated or a warning that 
it has been treated 
ms weiss also was the author of a recent report maintaining 
that many of the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have the 
potential of causing longterm health problems including cancer 
birth defects liver kidney or nerve damage as well as shortterm 
ailments 
the industry has defended its use of the chemicals saying the 
companies only use them in accordance with safety instructions 
supplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approved 
by the environmental protection agency for lawn care use 
we have to be registered and certified in most states said 
james brooks a spokesman for the professional lawn care 
association 
but ms weiss says in her new report that while the epa approves 
chemicals and doses that may be used on lawns some of the 
standards may be outdated and there is little federal regulation of 
companies that actually apply the chemicals 
federal regulations for example allow any company employee to 
apply chemicals as long as the worker is under the supervision of a 
person who is certified but the certified employee need not 
actually be present when the treatment is applied 
for the most part government regulation is just as lacking on 
the state level although the commercial lawn care industry has 
grown into a 15 billion business servicing more than 7 million 
households a year the report said 
most states have failed to take the necessary steps to protect 
public health from the hazards associated with law care 
pesticides said joan claybrook president of public citizen 
here are some of the findings according to the public citizen 
survey 
only six states require both that advance notice be given of 
scheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward those 
states are maryland massachusetts connecticut new jersey new 
york and rhode island 
maine and iowa require the warning signs but no advance notice 
while new hampshire and pennsylvania require the advance notice but 
no posttreatment warning signs 
a dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass a 
state test those states are arizona connecticut illinois 
indiana iowa kentucky massachusetts minnesota new mexico 
tennessee utah and wisconsin 
only in indiana and utah are lawn care employees required to be 
both trained and tested under statesupervised programs 
in most states consumers also are left without detailed 
explanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn care 
chemicals said ms weiss 
only massachusetts new york and maryland require state 
information sheets to be provided to customers seventeen other 
states have some form of consumer information requirement but in 
many cases that amounts to merely providing the names of the 
pesticides being used the report said 
this is inadequate because pesticide labels are often 
difficult if not impossible to understand and do not tell the 
full story about a chemicals known or potential chronic health 
effects said ms weiss

some of the agriculture departments federal 
aid programs of last year have been kicked into gear to help 
farmers through the 1989 version of drought and privation 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced on wednesday the 
reactivation of some of the key parts of last years drought 
assistance package including permission to graze livestock and cut 
hay from land set aside for conservation use under 1989 crop 
programs those include programs for wheat feed grains rice and 
cotton 
the emergency measures will apply to kansas and other states 
where drought has hurt 1989 crop prospects and in counties where 
farmers meet eligibility standards 
rain is what these states need but i cant guarantee that 
yeutter said however i trust the assistance we are able to 
provide will help 
livestock and poultry producers also will be able to buy surplus 
grain owned by the departments commodity credit corp at half 
price in a related program ccc will help pay feed cost for 
farmers who must purchase more than usual amounts of feed for 
livestock 
yeutter said he had directed the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service to respond within 24 hours to requests from 
the agencys state offices for drought aid 
the emergency measures he said will have the potential to 
make substantially more acres available to farmers for haying and 
grazing this year and thus help stem any forced livestock 
liquidations 
yeutter said he had also instructed the farmers home 
administration to sell hay at reasonable cost and take bids for 
livestock grazing on farmers taken over by the agency in counties 
where the emergency grazing of setaside acres has been approved 
kelly shipp yeutters press secretary said the aid package is 
essentially the same as usda made available during the 1988 
drought which spread by summer throughout most of the nation and 
cut last years harvests sharply 
asked if there were significant changes from what was offered 
last year shipp said not really its pretty straightforward 
shipp said that while kansas is expected to benefit greatly from 
the emergency assistance farmers in a number of other states are 
also expected to be eligible including iowa nebraska oklahoma 
and texas others are expected to qualify too she said 
yeutter also announced that a 1989 usda drought task force has 
been established headed by undersecretary richard t crowder who 
oversees international affairs and commodity programs 
the action followed yeutters visit april 14 to the hardhit 
winter wheat drought area with sens robert dole and nancy 
kassebaum rep pat roberts all kansas republicans and gov mike 
hayden 
in a letter to hayden yeutter said he had no authority to 
extend to 1989 wheat producers the broader relief provisions in 
last years 39 billion disaster assistance act a move that had 
been sought by the governor 
the 1988 law included disaster payments to farmers who lost at 
least 35 percent of their normal crop production 
rep dan glickman dkan applauded yeutters decision but said 
it was unfortunate it took him this long to respond 
it doesnt go far enough but at least its a recognition that 
there are people who need help said glickman and from here we 
can proceed to provide more help to them 
dole said these first steps cant take the place of a weeks 
worth of rain or a green wheat field but its the best news yet 
under the circumstances 
on capitol hill meanwhile usdas chief meteorologist norton 
strommen told members of congress that except in the central great 
plains the weather outlook for crops has improved greatly 
conditions are much more encouraging than in 1988 strommen 
said 
but he said the damage from a february freeze and lack of spring 
rain has caused irreversible damage to a large part of the winter 
wheat crop in the texas and oklahoma panhandles west kansas and 
southern nebraska 
strommen said he expects a more normal distribution of summer 
rainfall and a weather pattern favorable to the spring planting 
that is beginning 
despite the severe damage to the winter wheat crop in kansas 
usda and private analysts think the total us wheat harvest will 
be up substantially from last year when production dropped to 181 
billion bushels 
unofficially those put 1989 total wheat output at around 21 
billion bushels or more but that would not be enough to rebuild 
depleted us wheat stockpiles siphoned off by export demand the 
past year 
on june 1 the beginning of the 198990 wheat marketing year 
the stockpile is forecast by usda at a meager 549 million bushels 
down from 126 billion bushels a year ago and 182 billion two 
years ago

a lastminute change of heart by ted turner 
will keep commercials out of the news show for schools that his 
turner broadcasting system inc plans to launch in august 
the decision prohibiting ads on the new program from turners 
cable news network puts the atlantabased company squarely at odds 
with whittle communications lp which has been testing a similar 
news show with commercials 
educators who have criticized the whittle program for letting 
companies pitch candy bars and shampoo to a captive audience 
applauded turner 
ted turner should be commended for responding to this ethical 
concern gary marx an executive of the american association of 
school administrators said wednesday 
turner said he initially had planned to help pay for the daily 
15minute news program for schools by getting companies to 
underwrite up to two minutes of messages per show the messages 
would advocate such causes as safe driving and the importance of 
staying in school 
but turner said he changed his mind after hearing marx object to 
that type of advertising while at a private breakfast turner held 
wednesday for about 40 educators shortly before the news conference 
to announce the venture 
turner said the show cnn newsroom will cost millions of 
dollars but he said cnn was profitable enough to absorb it 
christopher whittle head of the knoxville tennbased company 
that recently completed a sevenweek test of its channel one news 
service in six schools said he still thinks his show with 
commercials is on the right track 
the money channel one collects for advertising will be used to 
supply each of the participating schools with about 50000 in 
video recording equipment tv monitors and satellite dishes if 
whittle decides to expand the test nationally 
we wish the cable industry the best of luck in its endeavor to 
bring free news and information programming to schools whittle 
said in a statement 
but he added that channel one successfully addresses what has 
been the gap between need and delivery in the past by delivering 
all of the components necessary to deliver news and information 
programming to students 
whittle is evaluating results of the test of channel one and 
hopes to decide by midsummer whether to expand the service to as 
many as 10000 schools nationwide in the fall of 1990 
turner is not supplying equipment to the schools but will make 
teachers guides with tips on how to use the material available to 
schools that have the right computer equipment to receive it 
three top cable operators telecommunications inc 
continental cablevision inc and jones intercable joined turner 
at the news conference to express support for his program and 
pledged to see that schools in their areas each were equipped to 
receive the show the three operators serve about a third of the 
estimated 50 million homes with cable nationally 
turner said he expected individual cable operators would decide 
for themselves what to do if some schools cannot afford video 
recording equipment or monitors 
cnn plans to run the cnn newsroom show before dawn every school 
day so that teachers can record it and replay all or parts of it as 
they wish 
whittle sends channel one by satellite overnight to 
participating schools and requires that the show be played once a 
day throughout the school 
turner declined to say how much lost revenue his decision 
against any advertising cost the new program 
but some industry insiders said the commercialfree news program 
could work to the entire industrys benefit by building up some 
goodwill at a time when calls have grown for more regulation of the 
industry

both sides of the abortion issue are finding 
grounds for hope as they await a supreme court ruling in a key 
missouri case that could alter the right of women to end their 
pregnancies 
frank susman a st louis lawyer who urged the court wednesday 
to strike down a missouri law restricting abortions said he is not 
conceding any votes among the nine justices 
i have given up on no one he told reporters after the 
hourlong argument session that packed the courtroom and drew more 
than 200 demonstrators and spectators outside the court building 
twentyseven prochoice protesters were arrested for 
breaking through police barriers that lined the court buildings 
plaza 
referring to the courts 1973 ruling in roe vs wade decision 
that legalized abortion nationwide susman said he believed the 
justices are now aware roe works you cannot put the cork back in 
the bottle you cant turn the clock back 16 years 
missouri attorney general william webster who urged the court 
to uphold the states abortion regulations even if it does not 
reverse the broader 1973 decision also said he was pleased with 
the arguments 
to the extent roe works you have to ask yourself why we are 
standing in front of the court 13 years after the case was 
decided and after numerous subsequent court rulings on abortion 
webster said 
he said the missouri regulations are a lot less severe than the 
prochoice forces claim and stop far short of outlawing 
abortions 
the debate has been polarized and exploited frankly the 
missouri law just doesnt go that far he said 
harvard law professor charles fried a former top reagan 
administration official argued in behalf of the bush 
administration he urged the court to overturn its 1973 ruling but 
declined to speak to reporters outside the courtroom after the 
argument session 
the justices who do not necessarily have to reconsider roe vs 
wade in resolving the missouri dispute gave little indication of 
how broad their decision will be they are expected to announce 
their ruling by july 
at one point justice antonin scalia a potential swing vote 
along with justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy 
asked whether the court must consider the nature of a fetus 
can you derive a fundamental right to abortion without 
making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or 
not scalia asked the lawyers 
the justices will take their initial vote in the missouri case 
friday in a closeddoor meeting they will discuss their views 
beginning a process that will include drafting and redrafting 
opinions 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said she was heartened by the discussion before the justices 
because it focused in part on the link between abortion rights and 
contraception rights 
weve said all along the right to privacy is the same in 
both cases she said 
she and others in the abortion battle agreed the courts ruling 
while potentially momentous will not be the last word 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said while the attention of the national 
press is on the supreme court today it is important to keep in 
mind that prochoice activities are occurring all across the 
country we must take our message to the public today and tomorrow 
and every day until we settle this issue once and for all 
james bopp general counsel to the national right to life 
committee said opponents of the missouri law are seeking to 
expand the right to abortion the question is whether the court is 
ready to make that right more absolute 
a federal appeals court relying on roe vs wade struck down 
major provisions of the missouri law as unconstitutional the law 
banned use of public hospitals for performing abortions not 
necessary to save a womans life prohibited any public employee 
from performing or assisting an abortion or encouraging or 
counseling women to have abortions and required doctors to 
determine whether a fetus older than 19 weeks is capable of 
surviving outside the womb by for example testing lung maturity

a man accused of murder and a potential 
witness against him held hands through the jail bars that separated 
them as they were married and now she cannot be forced to testify 
against him 
jacqueline jonet thomas on wednesday married cedric burton who 
is charged with firstdegree murder in the death of a car salesman 
the victim was kidnapped during a test drive robbed and shot 
desoto parish district attorney don burkett who tried 
unsuccessfully to get the courts to forbid the ceremony until after 
the trial said burton will still be tried for the death of michael 
wade langton 
it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the evidence 
in a case before it is tried but the marriage of the witness will 
have absolutely no effect on the case going forward burkett 
said it is fixed for trial on june 26 and it will go to trial 
on june 26 
burkett had said earlier that thomas was living with burton when 
langton was slain and her testimony could destroy burtons alibi 
against charges of murder aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery 
under state law someone cannot be compelled to testify against 
a spouse 
thomas got a marriage license tuesday at the parish clerks 
office on wednesday state district judge claude r sledge waived 
the required 72hour waiting period the couple said their vows a 
few hours later before a baptist clergyman 
two jailers served as witnesses and other jail employees 
gathered around for the doublering ceremony 
the couple won the right to marry april 12 when the 2nd circuit 
court of appeal in shreveport upheld sledges ruling that the state 
lacked the authority to prevent someone from marrying 
jail administrator jerry lowe spent several days calling 
ministers before he found one willing to marry the couple 
burton said on april 19 that he had changed his mind and wanted 
to postpone the wedding but after talking with thomas last 
weekend he told lowe he was ready to proceed with the marriage

the senate intelligence committee will try to 
determine why congressional irancontra investigators were not 
given crucial reagan administration documents that turned up during 
the trial of oliver north 
the documents which were missed during a supposedly thorough 
search of administration files during the panels 1987 
investigation portray far more clearly than previously known the 
involvement of reagan and thenvice president george bush in aid to 
the nicaraguan rebels throughout 1985 
three former members of the senate investigating panel said in a 
letter to intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla and 
vice chairman william cohen rmaine that a quick staff review 
found four documents introduced as evidence in norths trial that 
they had never seen before 
two other documents released at the trial are similar to ones in 
the committees files but include important attachments or 
notations that are missing from the committee versions 
one document an april 25 1985 memo from thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane recommends that reagan telephone 
honduran president roberto suazo to reassure him of us backing 
for the contras missing from the congressional copy is the 
notation cc vice president apparently showing that bush was 
sent a copy of the memo 
these six documents are sufficient to raise questions about 
the procedures followed by the executive branch in providing 
documents to the irancontra committee and the completeness of its 
compliance with agreements on the provision of documents the 
letter stated 
the request was signed by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and sens daniel inouye dhawaii and warren 
rudman rnh the chairman and vice chairman of the senate 
irancontra panel 
boren in a statement promised to look at this matter 
expeditiously and in a businesslike nonpolitical manner 
responding for the bush administration white house counsel c 
boyden gray wrote mitchell on wednesday we have confidence that 
the last administration followed the agreed procedures for 
releasing the material and that its representatives will be able 
to address your concerns we of course endeavor to be as helpful 
as we can 
the letter from the senators said some of the documents contain 
key evidence about the way us officials conducted policy in 
central america in 1985 and raise questions regarding 
possible efforts to circumvent the provisions of the law which 
barred direct or indirect us aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
one of the documents a feb 20 1985 memo from north to 
mcfarlane states it is very clear that the law forbids any 
direct or indirect military aid for the contras that is at odds 
with testimony by north and other administration during the 
congressional hearings that they had believed they had found a 
loophole to get around the law 
a similar request for an investigation was made two weeks ago by 
rep lee hamilton dind who was chairman of the house 
irancontra committee an aide to hamilton said wednesday that he 
had not yet received a response to his request which was directed 
to gray 
congressional investigators ultimately concluded in november 
1987 that a cabal of zealots in the reagan administration 
seized control of policy in the affair which sent weapons to iran 
and profits from the sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
despite the documents released in the north case former 
committee counsel mark belnick now a new york attorney said he 
does not believe that conclusion would have been much different had 
the documents been turned over 
the documents were clearly called for we would like to have 
had them and they would have led to additional questions he 
said but if this is the sum and substance they wouldnt have 
materially changed any of the conclusions reached by 
investigators he said 
among documents which the congressional panels did not receive 
a feb 19 1985 memo for reagan outlining a plan to step up 
us aid to honduras in return for its support of the contras and 
proposing that an emissary go to honduran president suazo and 
very privately outline the link between us aid and help for 
the rebels approval of the proposal is initialed rr 
a memo dated feb 20 1985 from north and nsc official raymond 
burghardt to mcfarlane noting that the emissary to honduras would 
be needed to keep the request to aid the contras secret from 
congress 
an oct 30 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane outlining plans 
for reconnaissance flights over nicaragua and mentioning plans to 
airdrop two recoilless rifles to the rebels 
a feb 22 1985 memo outlining plans for delivery to suazo of a 
reagan letter promising support for honduras if needed against 
nicaraguan military attack and saying i hope that your 
government will do all in its power to support those who struggle 
for freedom and democracy

two dredging ships from the us army corps of 
engineers have been modified to provide cleanup crews with their 
most effective weapon yet against the massive oil spill in alaska 
army officials say 
the hopper dredging vessels normally pick up silt sand and 
other debris from the bottom of harbors off the coast of valdez 
alaska however the corps has shown that such ships can be altered 
to suck up huge quantities of oil floating on the oceans surface 
the two dredging ships are the major oil pickup vehicles up 
there now robert w page the assistant army secretary for civil 
works said in an interview wednesday we are really forging 
ahead with a new technology 
over the past week the hopper dredges essayons and 
yaquina have managed together to pick up roughly 3300 barrels 
of oil that represents 36 percent of all the oil recovered since 
april 18 when the 200foot yaquina arrived on the scene page 
said the 350foot essayons joined the yaquina april 21 
by comparison page continued a soviet oil recovery ship named 
the vaydaghubsky that volunteered last week with great public 
fanfare to assist the oil cleanup effort has managed to reclaim 
only about 250 barrels 
we always knew these vessels were versatile said john p 
elmore the chief of the corps operations and readiness division 
adding it had taken the ships crews only half a day to modify the 
dredges for oil operations 
the technology being applied by the army corps is deceptively 
simple and involves only the rotation of the draghead the 
business end of a large boom that dangles off the side of the ship 
and leads to a huge hopper on board 
in normal operations the draghead is dropped into the water and 
pulled across the ocean bottom sucking silt or sand into the boom 
and up into the hopper 
according to page and elmore the corps initially experimented 
by raising the boom and huge draghead level with the ocean surface 
with disappointing results when that didnt work the corps 
decided to remove the dragheads from their booms rotate them 180 
degrees and then reattach them 
that simply turned the draghead and its huge suction mouth 
upside down where it could be placed just below the oceans 
surface and suck oil down instead of up 
its set up like a giant vacuum cleaner said page 
the inverted system was tested by the yaquina on april 20 and in 
the course of just 15 minutes the dredge sucked up 1500 barrels 
of oil page added 
the yaquina and essayons are now attacking the oil spill when

house members of the proirish caucus say 
congress should renew support of an economic grant program in 
northern ireland but nationalist critics say the program must 
first stop discriminating against the roman catholic minority 
the international fund for ireland is an outgrowth of the 1985 
angloirish pact the program seeks to ease violence between the 
protestants and catholics in britishruled northern ireland by 
improving economic conditions with special grants designed to 
create jobs in the unemploymentwracked nation 
most of the funds money has come from a threeyear 120 
million us aid package pushed by thenpresident reagan and 
thenhouse speaker thomas p oneill jr dmass fund advocates in 
congress now are pressing for another threeyear package to provide 
50 million annually 
the fund is the only way the united states can play a 
constructive role in northern ireland said rep brian j 
donnelly chairman of the friends of ireland congressional caucus 
he was joined by house majority leader thomas foley dwash 
proponents cited new fund projects such as one to build a 
shopping center in a poor catholic neighborhood outside of west 
belfast that has no local food store 
but father sean mcmanus national director of the irish national 
caucus and a leading fund critic said there is blatant naked 
discrimination against northern irelands catholic minority in 
the distribution of funds he called for a congressional 
investigation 
in county fermanagh one of six counties in northern ireland 87 
percent of the fund money went to protestants while catholics 
received 10 percent he said the countys catholicprotestant 
population is split 52 percent to 48 percent 
gerald e coleman national information officer of the irish 
american unity conference cited cases of abuse including the use 
of fund money to build luxury hotels saunas golf courses and a 2 
million british government fishing vessel he called for a 
restructuring of the board to make it more independent of the 
britishcontrolled bureaucracy in northern ireland 
if st patrick headed the fund as currently structured it 
would discriminate against catholics coleman said 
subcommittee members including reps gary l ackerman dny 
and benjamin a gilman rny said they back continued us 
support of the fund but expressed concern over the reports of 
abuse and discrimination 
my support of the fund should not be taken as blind faith 
said ackerman who indicated that the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on europe would look at placing new requirements on 
us contributions 
gilman said the accounting firm of price waterhouse is now 
auditing the program for the united states results are expected 
within several months 
but donnelly and foley urged the subcommittee to provide 50 
million in us aid without new conditions or restrictions 
foley testifying with donnelly said the subcommittee should 
not be swayed by the arguments of mcmanus and coleman because they 
are opponents of the fund and the angloirish pact 
the majority leader specifically attacked colemans appearance 
before the subcommittee 
coleman according to his printed testimony was appearing on 
behalf of his group and eight other irish activist organizations 
including irish northern aid that group is registered with the 
justice department as the us agent of the irish republican army 
a catholic militant group according to foley 
i dont think they should really be welcomed said foley 
adding that it was the first time he knew of that an agent of a 
terrorist organization came before congress 
coleman said he was not a member of the ira and that his group 
did not advocate the iras violent activities

lawmakers are predicting a fight over 
president bushs proposal to develop two kinds of landbased 
nuclear missiles and are targeting the committee chairman who 
helped work out the deal without consulting colleagues 
house democrats who support the midgetman missile on wednesday 
called the bush proposal a sucker play that will ultimately use 
financial constraints to eliminate the singlewarhead missile they 
support under the plan a 10warhead railmobile mx missile would 
be deployed first 
but both supporters and opponents were upset with house armed 
service committee chairman les aspins failure to consult with them 
on what they considered a deal between the white house and the 
chairmen of the armed services panels aspin in the house and sam 
nunn dga in the senate 
it is not a rebellion rep barney frank dmass said 
after a meeting aspin held with about a dozen house democrats it 
is a reminder to him that he was never authorized to make this kind 
of deal 
the twomissile plan is putting frank in the position of 
supporting the mx which liberal democrats have opposed in the 
past in order to avoid supporting two mobile systems 
rep les aucoin dore said the meeting became a bit testy 
when members pointed out that consultation is different than 
notification the oregon democrat said his colleagues left a 
reminder card 
the genesis of the mxmidgetman plan is defense secretary dick 
cheneys original recommendation to move the nations 50 mx 
missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than 
developing the midgetman 
but president bush chose quick deployment of the mx and 
researchanddevelopment funding for the midgetman 
the pentagon budget calls for 12 billion funding in fiscal 
1990 for the mx and 100 million on the midgetman 
if you go through with those figures you might as well kiss 
the midgetman missile goodbye said rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass 
its really a onemissile package said aucoin who charged 
that sequencing mx first is just a sucker play 
aspin chairman since 1985 said he spoke for himself in 
discussions on the mx and midgetman missiles i was talking from 
my own point of view and what was necessary to get through in the 
house he said 
at the house armed services hearing with cheney aspin sought 
assurances that the midgetman missile would not be squeezed out and 
suggested possible legislation to ensure development of the 
strategic weapon 
aspin also argued that the two landbased missiles are necessary 
as a bargaining chip for us arms control negotiators dealing with 
the soviet union 
this issue of getting a consensus on where we go on landbased 
missiles is fundamental to whether we get a start agreement said 
aspin who told reporters he raised that point after frank left the 
meeting 
frank said he had consulted with republicans vin weber of 
minnesota newt gingrich of georgia and joseph mcdade of 
pennsylvania about defeating the midgetman 
i think les aspin miscalculated the extent to which the 
democrats will fall in line frank said and president bush 
miscalculated republicans falling in line to support the cheney 
plan 
weber who called the plan to fund midgetman a bad decision 
said budgetary constraints and demands of various domestic programs 
may force the hand of many lawmakers 
while there has been debate in the house over mx vs midgetman 
that debate has mainly taken place just among the defense 
intelligentsia of the congress weber said the problem among 
the rankandfile membership has been increasing hostility to 
defense spending

grunt the halfton pig whose abandonment 
and nearslaughter touched the hearts of hundreds who wanted to 
give him a home will spend the rest of his days roaming a ranch 
after sorting through about 300 offers nationwide that ranged 
from making the porker a county fair mascot to a pig farm stud 
officials chose a ranch in ojai 75 miles northwest of los angeles 
this place sounds like a perfect location with other 
animals there like donkeys geese all kinds of other animals 
gail christensen spokeswoman for the los angeles county department 
of animal care and control said wednesday 
grunt was taken to the shelter last week after his owners 
abandoned him in affluent rolling hills estates because they were 
moving they gave their gardener permission to butcher him but 
grunt was saved from becoming breakfast when his frightened squeals 
alerted neighbors 
at the shelter the pig apparently liked the fuss 
he seems to be happy about it said animal care officer 
leslie mitchell in fact he seems to be a big ham about it

at age 75 the original raggedy ann 
and raggedy andy dolls were beginning to look a little well 
ragged 
the dolls were removed tuesday from their case at a coral gables 
library and sent to new york for restoration 
you could repaint the face and replace the clothes and make a 
new doll but thats not what we want said barbara young arts 
services coordinator for the metrodade library system 
the dolls will be restored at a branch of the smithsonian 
institution and a textile expert will clean and mend them and 
their clothes 
they were given to the library by the late myrtle gruelle widow 
of johnny gruelle who wrote and illustrated the raggedy ann books 
first published in 1918 with the dolls as his models 
young noticed last year that the dolls needed to be restored 
she said in addition to the wear and tear from age the pair had an 
active youth 
they were played with quite a bit by the children of the

thanksgiving in april 
some texans say a weary band of conquistadors was the first to 
give thanks and feast 
amateur and professional historians of the mission trail 
association say the first thanksgiving feast was celebrated near

rock 
the association plans to reenact the april 30 1598 banquet on 
sunday about 6000 to 8000 spectators are expected officials 
said 
mission trail president sheldon hall said he wants the 
reenactment to become an annual springtime thanksgiving tradition

account of juan de onates 1598 expedition from central mexico to 
northern new mexico onate had been appointed to take formal 
possession of the rio grande basin in the name of spain

upon the rio grande the group spent 10 days hunting fishing and 
recovering then they sat down for a huge feast 
hall doesnt expect a change in the national observance of 
thanksgiving but said he wanted people to know about the 16th 
century meal in texas or the historical correction of the 
first thanksgiving

the latest kremlin shakeup is a tremendous 
victory for soviet president mikhail s gorbachev part of a 
methodical consolidation of his power and purge of his opponents 
analysts say 
it signals that gorbachev is strong and the bush 
administration cannot wait for two years to see whether he will be 
in power said jerry hough of duke university in durham nc 
gorbachev forced the retirement tuesday of 74 of the 301 voting 
members of the communist party central committee and promoted 24 
nonvoting members to full status 
although gorbachevs maneuver did not entirely rule out a 
backlash by soviet conservatives it appeared to guarantee him the 
top job for several years strengthening his hand at home and 
abroad 
president bush and other administration officials while 
welcoming gorbachevs efforts to democratize soviet politics and 
cut the size of the military have warned that the kremlin leader 
could be removed from power before the reforms are carried through 
bush has adopted a waitandsee attitude in reaching new 
ussoviet accords and administration spokesmen reacted 
cautiously wednesday to the latest kremlin developments simply 
expressing hope that they will further reform 
but private us experts on the soviet union agreed that the 
shakeup vastly strengthened gorbachevs hand 
one has to count this as obviously a tremendous victory for 
gorbachev said thane gustafson a sovietologist at georgetown 
university in washington 
but said gustafson what we have seen is a preemptive move 
that shows that gorbachev is not entirely serene 
by purging the socalled dead souls central committee 
members who have lost the party and government jobs that won them a 
spot on the policymaking body said gustafson gorbachev himself 
was telling us that he faced a threat 
only once since the 1920s has the central committee played the 
decisive role in kremlin politics in 1957 when nikita s 
khrushchev summoned it to overturn a vote of the ruling politburo 
ousting him as party leader seven years later the central 
committee and politburo agreed to dump khrushchev 
the removal of the dead souls was a clear victory for 
gorbachev but not as decisive as it could have been said 
marshall goldman of the russian research center at harvard 
university it reduces the pressure he faces from conservatives 
dmitri simes a soviet emigre scholar at the carnegie endowment 
for peace in washington said the dead souls were a potential 
pool of opposition who might have voted against gorbachev in 
favor of more conservative politburo members such as yegor 
ligachev or viktor chebrikov 
if you were gorbachev would you want one third of the central 
committee to have nothing to lose by going after you said simes 
the 24 nonvoting central committee members who advanced to 
voting status include conservatives as well as reformers said 
simes the one thing the new members have in common is that they 
owe their new status to gorbachev 
gorbachevs latest action fits a pattern including a central 
committee plenum last sept 30 in which he removed a number of 
aging politburo members including thenpresident andrei gromyko 
and shifted ligachev and chebrikov to new jobs gromyko lost his 
central committee seat tuesday but ligachev and chebrikov were not 
touched 
what he has done as usual is to divide those that remain 
said gustafson now there is a big plum that he can dangle before 
people telling them you be good and i will make you a full 
member central committee 
hough who does not agree that gorbachev faced a threat from 
conservative politburo members viewed the central committee purge 
as a calculated effort to strengthen the soviet leaders hand at 
home and abroad 
he has been strong all the way through since 1986 in my 
opinion said hough 
soviet officials said hough have fostered the belief that 
gorbachev faced a threat from ligachev and chebrikov 
now they understand that this has had two bad consequences 
said hough the stories about the ligachev opposition were 
unsettling both to ussoviet relations and to peasants who have 
been reluctant to take out longterm leases 
gorbachev so far has balked at decollectivizing land seized from 
peasants in 192930 but instituted longterm leases to encourage 
them to boost production and profits on land to which they have 
exclusive rights 
that program key to gorbachevs reforms and to increasing 
soviet food supplies has drawn few takers among a deeply 
suspicious farming class 
if they are going to persuade peasants to take leases they 
have to convince them that there will not be a palace coup in two 
years said hough

the coast guard commandant says the exxon 
valdez likely would have sunk and created a worse problem if its 
captain had succeeded in rocking the giant tanker off a reef where 
it spilled 11 million gallons of oil 
adm paul a yost also praised coast guard cmdr steve mccall 
who radioed a warning to captain joseph hazelwood i wouldnt 
recommend doing much wiggling 
yost told a news conference wednesday that was sound advice for 
the vessel that rested atop a pinnacle of reef in alaskas prince 
william sound with 42 million gallons of oil still in its hull 
a transcript of the march 24 conversation between mccall and 
hazelwood was released on tuesday after a freedom of information 
request from the anchorage daily news 
its probable that had the ship gotten off the reef it would 
have sunk in position where it was in about 300 feet of water 
yost told a news conference 
the remaining oil was transferred off the ship before it was 
moved several days after the incident 
it would have been much more difficult to remove the oil had the 
ship sunk yost said 
i dont know whether hazelwoods action was 
illconsidered yost said in response to a question but i 
think commander mccall gave the captain some very sound advice 
i hope what hazelwood ultimately did was in response to that 
advice which was not to jerk that thing off the pinnacle 
the transcript showed that mccall warned hazelwood to take it 
slow and easy after the captain said he there was a little 
problem here with the third mate but were working our way off the 
reef 
the transcript shows that mccall warned before you make any 
drastic attempt to get away make sure you dont you know start 
doing any ripping he added that the tide was still rising 
hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while 
intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of 
pollution into the water all misdemeanors 
exxon earlier had estimated that 101 million gallons of crude 
oil had spilled from the ship state officials said it was 112 
million and yost confirmed it was more than 11 million 
exxon said hazelwood was not on the bridge when the ship ran 
aground but had turned over the tanker to his third mate gregory 
cousins who was qualified to operate the ship but not licensed to 
steer it through the sound 
yost said hazelwoods reference to a little problem with 
the third mate may have only been a reference to the ships 
having run aground rather than an indication of any other problem 
with the third mate

jane roe a texas cleaning woman whose 
pregnancy led to the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion 
watched quietly as the supreme court revisited her case 16 years 
later 
recently emerged from the anonymity that had concealed her real 
name and kept her away from the court when it decided in her favor 
in 1973 norma mccorvey was inside the supreme court on wednesday 
as an observer during its arguments on whether to overturn the roe 
vs wade decision 
im very overwhelmed she said later i was just looking 
around and trying to listen to the arguments i was thinking i 
should have been there in 1973 
mccorvey as jane roe agreed to become a test case in the legal 
challenge of antiabortion laws when she became pregnant with a 
second child in 1970 
mccorvey 41 answered questions with great difficulty and 
stumbled through a nineline written statement as she met with 
reporters her present attorney gloria allred assisted her and 
told reporters that mccorvey has only a modest income cleans other 
peoples homes for a living and has a 10th grade education 
allred a feminist lawyer from los angeles known for her 
flamboyance has helped mccorvey put together a movie deal about 
her experience mccorvey is being paid as a consultant to the 
project 
she has been in hiding since april 4 when shotgun blasts were 
fired at her dallas home she suspects abortion opponents were 
trying to intimidate her 
mccorvey disputed suggestions she has been used in the new case 
and said she stepped forward at considerable risk because she still 
believes in the cause of a womans right to an abortion 
our law is in jeopardy for all the women of the united 
states she said i have to protect roe vs wade 
mccorvey said she considered an illegal abortion in 1970 but was 
revolted by conditions at a backalley abortionists office she 
visited 
she didnt have an abortion instead she gave birth and put her 
child up for adoption 
her lawyer said mccorvey considered the experience far more 
traumatic to her than an abortion would have been 
yet mccorvey said she has recently begun efforts to locate that 
adopted child whose conception triggered the landmark case 
allred insists theres no irony or inconsistency there the 
whole point is its about a womans right to choose she said 
so what would norma mccorvey once jane roe say to this child 
well i obviously wouldnt discuss politics right away she 
said id just say im your mom how about a hug

here are excerpts from the supreme court oral 
argument wednesday in a case in which the justices are being asked 
to overturn the courts 1973 decision in roe vs wade that women 
have a constitutional right to abortion 
missouri attorney general william webster this case represents 
a direct appeal that involves a 1986 missouri statute defining the 
rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in missouri 
missouris appeal involves three basic areas for this courts 
review the first the constitutional boundaries on the limitations 
of public funding the second the effect of and the facial 
constitutionality of legislation declaring that life begins at 
conception and third the ability of a state to require a 
physician to preform tests and to make and record findings when 
determining viability 
finally we have asked this court to reconsider the standard of 
review to be applied to state abortion regulation 
since 1973 this court has reaffirmed roe vs wades mandate 
state and lower federal courts have repeatedly interpreted that 
mandate frequently strictly against the states 
one result is that the states have effectively been forbidden 
not only to prohibit abortion but usually to regulate abortion in 
any significant way 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
webster it seems to us a convoluted result to suggest that if 
you can afford an abortion we have to provide one for you in a 
public facility but if you lack the financial capacity the 
state and other public governmental entities are not obligated to 
provide those services for you 
justice john paul stevens can i ask you one clarifying 
question what is the consequence of a violation of that section 
 
what if a doctor who had a patient in a public hospital went 
ahead and performed in the first trimester performed an abortion 
is there any sanction against the doctor if he did that 
webster this particular chapter of the law carries a general 
misdemeanor penalty for violations but there is no operative 
language 
stevens so it would be a misdemeanor then 
webster arguably it would be a misdemeanor 
stevens what is your opinion dont you know 
webster my opinion is that there is no language in that section 
which was adopted here which would suggest that it would make it a 
criminal offense 
stevens is it your opinion as the chief enforcement officer of 
the state that it would not be a misdemeanor 
webster we wouldnt view that violation as a misdemeanor no 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
justice anthony m kennedy wouldnt it be grounds for discharge 
 
webster it is conceivable the hospital board could if somebody 
violated the policy of that facility seek to discharge that 
particular employee

charles fried for the bush administration today the united 
states asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in 
roe vs wade 
at the outset i would like to make quite clear how limited that 
submission is 
first we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of 
unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in 
previous cases 
rather we are asking the court to pull this one thread 
and the reason is well stated by this court abortion is 
different 
it involves the purposeful termination as the court said of 
potential life 
and i would only add that in the minds of many legislators who 
pass abortion regulation it is not merely potential life but 
actual human life 
and though we do not believe that the constitutions 14th 
amendment takes any position on that question we think it is an 
utter non sequitur to say that therefore the organized community 
must also take no position in legislation and may not use such a 
position as a premise for regulation 
kennedy your position then is that griswold vs connecticut 
striking down a states ban on contraceptive sales as an invasion 
of personal privacy is correct and should be retained 
fried exactly your honor 
kennedy is that because there is a fundamental right involved 
in that case 
fried in griswold vs connecticut there was a right which was 
well established in a whole fabric of quite concrete matters quite 
concrete 
it involved not an abstraction such as the right to control 
ones body an abstraction such as the right to be let alone it 
involved quite concrete intrusions into the details of marital 
intimacy 
kennedy does the case stand for the proposition that there is a 
right to determine whether to procreate 
fried griswold surely does not stand for that proposition 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
justice sandra day oconnor do you say there is no fundamental 
right to decide whether to have a child or not a right to 
procreate do you deny that the constitution protects that right 
fried i would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract 
terms and i think the court prior to roe vs wade quite prudently 
also avoided such sweeping generalities 
oconnor do you think that the state has the right to if in a 
future century we had a serious overpopulation problem has a right 
to require women to have abortions after so many children 
fried i surely do not that would be quite a different matter 
oconnor what do you rest that on 
fried because unlike abortion which involves the purposeful 
termination of future life that would involve not preventing an 
operation but violently taking hands on laying hands on a woman 
and submitting her to an operation 
oconnor and you would rest that on substantive due process 
protection 
fried absolutely 
kennedy how do you define the liberty interests of the woman in 
that connection 
fried the liberty interest against a seizure would be involved 
that is how the court analyzed the matter in griswold 
kennedy how do you define the liberty interest of a woman 
in an abortion case

fried well i would think that there are liberty interests 
involved in terms perhaps of the contraceptive interest at 
all points it is an interest which is matched by the states 
interest in potential life 
i would like to make clear that in our view if roe were 
overruled this court would have to continue to police the far 
outer boundaries of abortion regulation under a due process 
rational basis test and that test is muscular enough to strike 
down any regulation which did not make proper provision for 
cases where the life of the mother was at risk 
stevens is there a difference between the courts power in the 
case of an abortion that would be life threatening to the woman and 
an abortion that would merely cause her severe and prolonged 
disease is there a constitutional difference 
fried i think that is a matter of degree and it is perfectly 
clear that severe health effects shade over into a threat to the 
life i cannot promise the court that our submission would dispense 
the federal courts from considering matter like that

justice byron r white suppose there is a state that permits 
abortions and they are done in public hospitals do you think that

fried i think the constitution takes no position on this point 
the countrys experience and the courts experience under the 
constitutionalization of that issue has been so regrettable that i 
could not in conscience recommend that it be constitutionalized in 
some other way at another point in the spectrum

frank susman for those who challenged the missouri law i think 
frieds submission is somewhat disingenuous when he suggests to 
this court that he does not seek to unravel the whole cloth of 
procreational rights but merely to pull a thread 
it has always been my personal experience that when i pull a 
thread my sleeve falls off 
there is no stopping 
it is not a thread he is after 
it is the full range of procreational rights and choices that 
constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized by this 
court 
for better or for worse there no longer exists any bright line 
between the fundamental right that was established in griswold and 
the fundamental right of abortion that was established in roe 
these two rights because of advances in medicine and science 
now overlap 
they coalesce and merge and they are not distinct 
justice antonin scalia you find it hard to draw a line between 
those two but easy to draw a line between first second and third 
trimester i dont see why a court that can draw that line cant 
separate abortion from birth control quite readily 
susman things have changed 
the bright line if there ever was one has now been 
extinguished 
thats why i suggest to this court that we need to deal with one 
right the right to procreate 
kennedy do you agree that the state can forbid abortions save 
to preserve the life of the mother after the fetus is say eight 
months old suppose the health rights of the mother are not 
involved 
susman yes i am willing to recognize the compelling interest 
granted in roe of a state in potential fetal life after the point 
of viability 
kennedy but that is a line drawing isnt it 
susman yes it is but that is a line that is more easily 
drawn 
procreational interests are indeed implicit in the concept of 
ordered liberty and neither liberty nor justice would exist without 
them 
it is truly a liberty whose exercise is deeply rooted in this 
nations history and tradition 
i suggest that there can be no ordered liberty for women without 
control over their education their employment their health their 
childbearing and their personal aspirations 
there does in fact exist a deeply rooted tradition that the 
government steer clear of decisions affecting the bedroom 
childbearing and the doctorpatient relationship as it pertains to 
these concerns 
chief justice william h rehnquist it is a deeply rooted 
tradition but surely abortion was regulated by the state in the 
19th century and in the 20th century 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
scalia let me inquire i can see deriving a fundamental right 
from either a long tradition that this the right to abort has 
always been protected i dont see that tradition but i suppose 
you could also derive a fundamental right just simply from the text 
of the constitution plus the logic of the matter or whatever 
how can you derive it that way here without making a 
determination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not it is 
very hard to say it just is a matter of basic principle that it 
must be a fundamental right unless you make the determination that 
the organism that is destroyed is not a human life can you as a 
matter of logic or principle make that determination otherwise 
susman i think the basic question whether this is a human 
life or whether human life begins at conception is not something 
that is verifiable as a fact it is a question verifiable only by 
reliance upon faith 
it is a question of labels 
neither side in this issue and debate would ever disagree on the 
physiological facts 
both sides would agree as to when a heartbeat can first be 
detected both sides would agree as to when brain waves can first 
be detected 
but when you come to try to place the emotional labels on what 
you call that collection of physiological facts that is where 
people part company 
scalia i agree with you entirely but what conclusion does that 
lead you to that therefore there must be a fundamental right on 
the part of the woman to destroy this thing that we dont know what 
it is or rather that whether there is or isnt is a matter that 
you vote upon since we dont know the answer people have to make 
up their minds the best they can 
susman the conclusion to which it leads me is it must be 
left as a fundamental right 
women do not make these decisions lightly they agonize over 
them and they take what we see out front of the building and 
what we see in the media and they personalize it

a father tearfully unhooked his comatose baby 
sons lifesupport system early wednesday then took him into his 
arms and kept hospital workers at gunpoint until the child was 
dead authorities said 
im not here to hurt anyone ill only hurt you if you try to 
plug my baby back in police quoted rudy linares as saying 
you can understand the motivation police sgt william 
rooney said i guess he didnt want his child to continue living 
under those conditions 
the painter from west suburban cicero was charged with murdering 
his 16monthold son samuel said lisa howard spokeswoman for the 
cook county states attorneys office 
this is the best thing linares wife tamara told radio 
station wbbmam sammy is out of his misery 
at an evening court hearing a judge ordered linares released on 
a 75000 recognizance bond which means he does not have to post 
money unless he fails to appear at future hearings 
but his release was delayed until early thursday when his 
family raised 1000 bail for an oustanding warrant from an 
unrelated incident in cicero 
assistant states attorney james piper in arguing that linares 
be held in jail told judge marvin ruttenberg that the weapon was 
cocked and linares had threatened to kill anybody who 
interfered 
we feel that showed that the defendant is a danger that 
lifethreatening actions were taken toward the nurses and other 
people piper said 
ruttenberg told linares to appear in court again on thursday 
about 25 people turned out in support of him including his 
wife and his mother father brother and family friends mrs 
linares is not charged in the boys death 
the couple has two other children both under 5 
linares also unhooked his sons life support system on dec 30 
but staff members reconnected it detective gary bulava said when 
linares arrived early wednesday he spoke briefly with security 
personnel but was not searched bulava added 
doctors had notified the parents tuesday that the child was to 
be transferred to a longterm care unit said rushpresbyterianst 
lukes medical center spokeswoman carolyn reed 
police said linares and his wife walked into the hospital about 
1 am and were escorted to the pediatric intensive care unit 
where their sons breathing had been sustained by a ventilator 
since an accident in august 
about 20 minutes later after his wife left the room for a drink 
of water linares pulled out a 357caliber magnum handgun ordered 
hospital staff out of the unit unhooked the infant from the 
lifesupport system and sat with his son in his arms 
one nurse disregarded linares order and attempted to reconnect 
the system but left the room when he cocked the hammer of the 
handgun police said 
three other youngsters were in the unit while about a halfdozen 
security personnel called by a nurse stood helpless just outside 
the room said rushpresbyterian spokeswoman carolyn reed 
linares eventually allowed nurses to enter the unit and remove 
the three other youngsters after about 30 minutes his own child 
was dead rooney said 
he never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child 
said rooney he sat there in a chair until the baby had expired 
then turned the gun over to the officers 
linares was calm at times he did a lot of crying said 
bulava 
linares had unhooked his sons life support system during a dec 
30 visit and staff members had reconnected the breathing 
apparatus bulava said linares had spoken with security personnel 
and received required clearance when he arrived in at the hospital 
but was not searched 
police and hospital spokeswoman carmine esposito said no charge 
resulted from the earlier incident because police had not been 
notified the childs condition wasnt changed ms esposito 
said 
lineras had been arrested on misdemeanor charges three times in 
recent years but the counts were unrelated in nature to 
wednesdays charge said a law enforcement source with knowledge of 
the case lineras was never convicted said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
hospital spokeswoman reed said samuel was taken to 
rushpresbyterian by ambulance last august with a blocked windpipe 
after he swallowed an object believed to be either a balloon or a 
small piece of aluminum foil 
oxygen deprivation left him partially brain dead according 
to ms reed and samuel had been in a coma since his arrival mrs 
linares said doctors worked 12 hours to resuscitate her son then 
despite their pleas to the contrary 
in the workingclass neighborhood where the linareses live 
neighbors expressed both resignation and surprise 
they were very very polite people said bernice kielb who 
lived two doors away i cant imagine what possessed him unless 
he got a bill in the mail you cant say he didnt love that baby 
across the street diana munoz said she had asked linares on 
tuesday how the baby was doing and he responded with a shrug 
still the same 
it shocked me she added he was too nice of a guy 
mrs munoz also said linares talked often of the child telling 
her recently the couple already had made funeral arrangements for 
samuel

the chairman of a house panel dealing with 
federal workers is calling on the bush administration to reduce the 
number of midlevel government jobs that are given to political 
appointees 
rep gerry sikorski dminn issued the plea on wednesday along 
with a congressional report that shows political appointees are 
taking over midlevel federal jobs traditionally held by career 
civil servants 
sikorski chairman of the human resources subcommittee of the 
committee on post office and civil service released a general 
accounting office report showing that 64 political appointees in 18 
agencies had recently been converted to career status 
the increasing number of conversions of political appointees 
into career positions is troubling especially where they 
infiltrate midlevel management positions traditionally held by 
longtime civil servants sikorski said

a california firm has won permission to build 
a coaxial cable tv system and permission to test a stateoftheart 
fiberoptic system that will allow customers to order movies every 
15 minutes by phone 
wednesdays ruling by the federal communications commission was 
challenged immediately by the national cable television 
association which said it appears to violate federal rules 
generally barring telephone companies from the cable tv business 
the fcc affirming a preliminary decision last year will let 
general telephone co build and operate the coaxial bundled copper 
wire cable system in the los angeles suburb of cerritos gte of 
california also provides phone service to cerritos

no adequate bids submitted to the city of cerritos for cable 
service except from general telephone gte is leasing the system to 
apollo cablevision to provide programming

the vicious attack and rape of a jogger in 
central park by a gang of teenage hoodlums has left many new 
yorkers trying to make sense of a senseless crime 
the victim a 28yearold investment banker remains in a coma 
eight of her alleged attackers ages 14 to 17 are in custody two 
were indicted wednesday and indictments against the others were 
expected today 
but by some accounts the youths seemed unlikely attackers 
although several came from broken homes and all lived in a harlem 
neighborhood surrounded by drugs alcohol crime and poverty 
i deal with kids in trouble these were not kids in trouble 
said bernard diamond principal of the junior high school two of 
the boys attended they come from homes of parents who care 
parents who are as shocked as we are 
their victim was on a solitary jog in the northern end of the 
park the night of april 19 she was beaten unconscious with a lead 
pipe and rock raped and left bound and nearly naked she was found 
several hours later 
doctors at metropolitan hospital where she has been in critical 
condition in a coma since the attack say that although she may 
survive its unlikely she will ever recover completely 
the woman apparently was one of several targets of the gang as 
it went wilding through the park that night 
the term was a new one to the police but not the activity for 
years loosely organized packs of marauding youths have roamed the 
streets and parks bullying robbing and attacking victims at random 
i aint going to say its fun its getting your anger out at 
somebody its like stealing fruit its not cause you are 
hungry a 15yearold boy who said he was a friend of one of the 
suspects told the new york times 
the assailants reportedly used racial epithets in one of eight 
assaults during the rampage and discussed getting whitey or 
getting a white jogger the victim is white and the accused 
attackers are black 
however law enforcement experts say victims of the socalled 
wolf packs are more often black than white and the lawyer for 
one of the youths denied the boy suggested the gang go after a 
white victim 
the suspects are being held on charges of attempted murder rape 
and assault and could face other charges 
lisa whitten of the national board of the association of black 
psychologists said the violence of city life allowed the boys to 
bury normal emotions in the frenzy of their attack 
theyre human beings who went berserk she said they had 
fantasies in their minds of being like those on television the 
ones who shoot people who are powerful in control macho 
aggressive strong 
police said only one of the suspects 17yearold michael 
brisco had a police record but friends said he was a frequent 
churchgoer who played drums for the choir 
after their arrests brisco and kharey wise 16 were roughed up 
in an attack by several other inmates and yusef salaam 15 was 
attacked by another youth at the spofford juvenile center 
tim burns a 15yearold schoolmate of suspect anton mccrary 
15 said hes a good kid he just followed the wrong crowd if 
youre in the wrong crowd this could happen to anybody you have 
to make your own decisions thats all 
since the attack hundreds of runners neighbors of the 
suspects friends of the woman and other new yorkers have gathered 
in the park and outside the hospital to pray for the victim 
were here today to pray in sympathy with the victim and her 
family william s perkins president of the residents council 
of the housing development where four of the eight suspects live 
said at a vigil he organized tuesday through prayer we can heal 
the wounds on her body and the racial wounds this has caused to 
society 
friends and strangers have filled her room with flowers 
the park has a reputation largely undeserved police and city 
officials say of being a dangerous place 
its notorious because it is central park if this had 
happened in the streets it wouldnt be anything like this said 
eva haws who takes tourists on carriage rides through the park

the governing party rammed the 1989 budget through 
committee today setting the stage for prime minister noboru 
takeshita to fulfill his pledge to resign to take responsibility 
for the recruit corruption scandal 
but the question of who will be japans next prime minister was 
thrown into confusion as the top contender former foreign minister 
masayoshi ito said he would decline any offer to succeed takeshita 
an advisory board to the the prime minister today recommended an 
overhaul of regulations governing politicians fundraising to 
avoid the conflict of interest and influencepeddling that have 
dogged takeshitas administration 
takeshita pledged tuesday to resign after the budgets passage 
to take responsibility for the recruit co stockprofiteering and 
bribery scandal which has buffeted his administration for 10 
months 
the budget committee of the house of representatives japans 
powerful lower house took just one minute to approve the budget 
the session was boycotted by opposition party members 
japanese lawmakers like to operate by consensus so the boycott 
was seen as more than just symbolic 
takeshitas liberal democratic party was expected to force the 
budget through parliament on friday again in the absence of the 
opposition which is demanding new parliamentary elections and that 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone be summoned to testify 
about his role in the scandal 
there still was no clear successor to takeshita as many senior 
liberal democratic leaders are linked to the scandal 
ito widely viewed as the top candidate for interim premier 
said today that he would not serve due to poor health ito 76 has 
heart problems caused by diabetes 
takeshita met wednesday with shintaro abe secretary general of 
the governing party and the two agreed to decide after a holiday 
week that ends may 6 on a new party president who will 
automatically become prime minister 
ito told reporters that masaharu gotoda an exchief of the 
national police who served as the top cabinet aide to nakasone 
might be an appropriate choice gotoda 76 now heads an ethics 
panel appointed by takeshita and comprised of members of the 
governing party 
another blueribbon panel made up of prominent members of the 
private and academic sectors today recommended a series of reforms 
including requiring all members of parliament to make public their 
assets and banning them from trading in stocks or giving monetary 
gifts at funerals and weddings 
currently only cabinet members must divulge their assets there 
are no restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on 
stocks and parliamentarians routinely spend huge sums on wedding 
and funeral offerings to their constituents 
oppositionists blasted the liberal democrats strongarm tactics 
on the budget complaining that takeshitas impending resignation 
was not enough to resolve the recruit scandal 
the budgetary moves came a day after the suicide of a former 
takeshita aide who handled takeshitas political funds 
ihei aoki 58 who had served takeshita since 1958 was found 
dead in his tokyo apartment after he slashed his wrist and ankle 
and hanged himself 
it was in aokis name that stock dealings and a 384000 loan 
from recruit co the firm at the center of the scandal were 
carried out 
aoki is among more than a dozen politicians and political aides 
who bought shares of a subsidiary of recruit a giant business 
services conglomerate before they were offered publicly thus 
reaping huge profits in all more than 150 political business and 
media figures purchased the shares 
the transactions though not illegal badly tarnished the image 
of the governing party and takeshitas admnistration three of his 
cabinet ministers resigned when it was discovered they or their 
aides had purchased the stocks or received sizable contributions 
from recruit 
a widely unpopular tax reform also forced through parliament by 
the liberal democrats earlier this year contributed to public and 
political outcries against takeshita plunging his support rate to 
historic lows 39 percent according to one poll this month

while ranging from 13170 yen to 13225 yen 
traders said the dollar opened higher in tokyo following its 
strength in new york where a release of us economic growth 
figures boosted dollarbuying 
the us commerce department reported wednesday the nations 
economy as measured by its gross national product expanded at a 
robust annual rate of 55 percent during the first three months of 
1989 the fastest pace in more than a year 
japanese investors were reluctant to make further purchase of 
the currency due to speculation about an interest rate hike in 
japan as well as the bank of japans market intervention if the 
dollar rises further said a trader with a major commercial bank in 
tokyo 
many investors are speculating that the central bank might raise 
the nations interest rate depending on the consumer price index 
for march which is to be released friday 
but a trader with the bank of tokyo speaking anonymously said 
bullish sentiment for the dollar remains a basic trend 
on the stock exchange a moderate gain in the markets main 
barometer followed a similar trend on overseas markets overnight 
dealers said 
the nikkei slowed down as some participants sold issues for 
profit taking said a dealer with a major securities firm in tokyo

a gunwielding father who tearfully unhooked his 
comatose sons lifesupport system and held him until the baby died 
has been charged with murder for an act he said he committed 
because i loved my son 
rudy linares entered the hospital room of his 16monthold son 
samuel and unhooked the boys ventilator holding hospital workers 
at bay with a 357caliber magnum handgun police said 
no one has the right to take the law into his own hands 
said cook county states attorney cecil partee the facts of this 
case clearly dictate the filing of firstdegree murder charges 
at the hearing wednesday night prosecutors said the 23yearold 
cicero house painter should be held without bail on the murder 
charge because the gun was cocked and linares had threatened to 
kill anybody who interfered 
but judge marvin ruttenberg ordered linares released on a 
75000 recognizance bond which means he does not have to put up

of his misery 
linares had unhooked his sons life support system during a dec 
30 visit but staff members reconnected the apparatus bulava said 
a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said no 
charge resulted from the earlier incident because police had not 
been notified 
rushpresbyterian spokeswoman carolyn reed said samuel had been 
brought to the hospital last summer with a blocked windpipe after 
he swallowed an object believed to be either a balloon or a small 
piece of aluminum foil 
oxygen deprivation left him partially brain dead according 
to ms reed and the boy had been in a coma since his arrival eight 
months ago 
mrs linares said doctors worked 12 hours to resuscitate her son 
at the time despite their pleas to the contrary 
the linares family previously had asked about disconnecting the 
lifesupport system but the medical center told them it could not 
do so without a court order because there still was some sign of 
brain activity the family had been scheduled to meet with a lawyer 
friday to discuss the matter

as a young girl in western new york 
lucille ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as 
she dreamed of starring in movies hometown friends recalled 
she always talked about being a star said pauline lopus 
who went to school with miss ball and had kept in touch with her 
miss ball born 60 miles south of buffalo in jamestown on aug 
6 1911 grew up in nearby celoron a rural hamlet on chautauqua 
lake 
mrs lopus remembered the sitcom star on wednesday as daring 
in many ways 
she tried to get me to run off to broadway mrs lopus 
added but i didnt have the nerve 
at 15 miss ball worked as a barker at the amusement park 
screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her 
voice 
later she starred in high school plays and got her start in 
front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct 
palace theater in jamestown 
although miss ball hadnt visited jamestown since 1956 and had 
no family there she stayed in touch with friends 
even though she was a big star she was still just lucy to 
us said irene rosseti of celoron 
mrs rosseti said miss ball recently sent her and her husband a 
letter on their 50th wedding anniversary 
miss ball regularly donated money to charities civic events and 
jamestown community college said jamestown mayor steven carlson 
on may 20 miss ball was to receive an honorary degree from the 
college and had planned to return to jamestown now a city of about 
40000 
residents had put up posters saying jamestown loves lucy in 
storefronts and home windows after miss ball suffered a heart 
attack last week residents decided to sign the posters and send 
them to her as a getwell greeting more than 150 posters were sent 
with 10000 signatures 
the 77yearold comedian died wednesday of a ruptured aorta the 
main heart artery at cedarssinai medical center in los angeles 
where she was recovering from last weeks emergency heart surgery 
it is a sad day for all of us said nelson garifi an 
organizer of the welcoming event but im sure that feeling is 
shared by many people around the world 
garifi community relations director for the community college 
said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously 
future generations in celoron will have a reminder of their 
famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where 
she grew up it will be renamed lucy lane 
village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the 
street when she was due in the area next month 
but it will happen anyway john goodell of the villages 
historical society said wednesday 
when the society was formed about a year ago goodell said we 
sent an invitation to lucille ball to be a member and she sent 
back a check for 500 for a life membership

the most common kind of prostate operation may not 
be as effective as traditional surgery for relieving prostate woes 
in older men a study published today concludes 
a form of surgery called transurethral prostatectomy has largely 
replaced traditional open surgery to cut away enlarged prostate 
glands in the newer procedure surgeons push a thin tube up the 
urethra to the prostate where a cutting loop slices the excess 
tissue patients recover more quickly and have less pain with this 
approach 
however new data from three countries suggests that men are 
substantially more likely to require a second operation after the 
transurethral procedure 
in addition the researchers said their data raise the 
possibility that men are more likely to die in the years 
immediately after the transurethral operation although they said 
more study is necessary to be sure this is true 
the study directed by dr noralou p roos of the university of 
manitoba in winnipeg was published in todays new england journal 
of medicine it was based on the records of 36703 men undergoing 
prostate surgery in denmark 5284 in england and 12090 in canada 
the need for second operations ranged from 12 percent to 16 
percent of patients in the three countries undergoing transurethral 
surgery compared with 2 percent to 5 percent of those getting open 
surgery 
the death rate during eight years of followup was higher in the 
transurethral patients in all three countries this difference was 
most carefully analyzed in the canadian patients and the 
researchers found that those getting the transurethral procedure 
there had a 45 percent higher death rate the excess of deaths was 
due mainly to more heart attacks 
in an accompanying editorial dr sheldon greenfield of new 
england medical center said the study does not provide convincing 
evidence that open prostatectomy carries less risk than 
transurethral prostatectomy 
he said men might have been more likely to get the transurethral 
procedure if they already had heart disease

a 60000yearold neanderthal neck bone 
resembles its counterpart in modern humans suggesting the ancient 
creatures were anatomically equipped to speak researchers reported 
today 
scientists are interested in the neanderthals capability for 
those sounds because it bears on the question of whether 
neanderthals were direct ancestors of modern man or simply an 
evolutionary dead end 
the discovery of the tiny ushaped bone is reported in the 
british journal nature by reseael france and 
moorhead state university in minrchers from isranesota 
other scientists said the find is unlikely to end the debate 
about neanderthal speech capabilities 
the neanderthals who lived in europe and asia until about 
35000 years ago undoubtedly did communicate in some fashion 
because their culture was relatively advanced scientists say the 
debate is whether they were physically able to speak 
the new fossil unearthed from kebara cave at mount carmel in 
israel is a hyoid bone in the body the hyoid lies between the 
root of the tongue and the larynx 
in the nature paper the researchers said the fossil bone is 
almost identical in size and shape to modern hyoids along with 
other evidence that suggests that that the larynx or voice box 
also he 
mount sinai school of medicine in new york 
secondly he said he does not see how the isolated bone will 
help scientists determine the position of the larynx in the throat 
he called that crucial to the question of neanderthals speech 
capabilities 
the larynx is lower in the throat of modern humans than it was 
in very early ancestors he said the lower position allows for the 
space above it to act as a resonating chamber which is required 
for fully articulate speech he said 
in an editorial accompanying the nature paper john marshall of 
the radcliffe infirmary at oxford england cautioned that 
determining function from anatomy is tricky 
the argument about neanderthal language capability he wrote 
will undoubtedly run and run until we discover a deepfrozen 
neanderthal who is susceptible to resuscitation 
a second report in nature confirms an earlier study that 
suggested anatomically modern humans lived in the middle east some 
90000 years ago that was more than twice the age scientists had 
been able to establish reliably for the existence of anatomically 
modern humans 
scientists from britain canada and israel studied the age of 
cattle teeth associated with human remains in the skhul cave at 
mount carmel they found that the teeth and so the humans are at 
least about 81000 years old and more probably about 101000 years 
old 
that resembles the age of about 92000 years reported last year 
for similar humans in the qafzeh cave in israel 
anatomically modern humans may have occupied the area only 
intermittently during that era study coauthor christopher 
stringer said in an interview 
neanderthals probably were more established there but it is not 
clear whether they encountered the anatomically modern humans said 
stringer curator of fossil hominids at the british museum natural 
history in london

as the us supreme court heard arguments on a womans right to 
an abortion and as thousands demonstrated nationwide one woman 
made final plans for an abortion at the st louis clinic that 
started the case 
my finances wont let me have another child i think i should 
have the right to choose the 23yearold woman who spoke on the 
condition on anonymity said wednesday 
there were more concerns in the waiting room this morning 
said amelia mccracken spokeswoman for reproductive health 
services which initiated the case before the nations high court 
by challenging restrictions in missouris abortion law there is 
an awareness an edge today that i havent seen previously 
the supreme court could use its ruling in the case of webster 
vs reproductive health services to tighten or even overturn its 
landmark 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion 
the st louis clinic a target in the past of many antiabortion 
protests was quiet wednesday but from connecticut to california 
people marched and spoke out at rallies on both sides of the issue 
the crowds were mostly prochoice and many who had abortions 
told their stories 
i am compelled by the thought that someone else could have 
made such a personal decision for me said cynthia shang 24 of 
durham nc who spoke before 800 prochoice demonstrators in 
raleigh she said she had an abortion at age 19 
we are committed to a womans inalienable right to her own 
womb she said it is not the property of the state it is not 
the property of the church 
but in sacramento calif nola jones told reporters she had two 
abortions before becoming an abortion foe abortion is a major 
death experience women cannot participate in the death of their 
own child and not be psychologically impaired she said 
about 2000 prochoice demonstrators rallied at the state 
capital in sacramento and a halfdozen abortion opponents gathered 
nearby 
the abortion foes approached the rally but were surrounded by 
prochoice demonstrators state police separated the groups then 
stayed between them throughout the protest 
this is not a womens issue actor tim busfield who plays 
elliot weston on abcs thirtysomething told the prochoice 
rally its a family issue its a human rights issue 
elsewhere rallies were held in albany ny at yale law school 
in new haven conn columbus ohio fort wayne ind and at the 
university of california berkeley in the culmination of an 
oncampus vigil that went on for days 
and about 800 backers of legalized abortion marched in atlanta 
this is a monumental day of reckoning for womens lives in the 
us said victoria lambert a spokeswoman for the coalition 
opposing operation rescue 
operation rescue which has mounted a series of major 
antiabortion protests aimed at blocking access to abortion 
clinics is planning protests in 65 cities friday and saturday 
said spokeswoman barbara magera in binghamton ny 
she said the group would work for a human life amendment to 
the constitution and would seek bans on abortion in individual 
states in the event the supreme court overturns roe vs wade 
many speakers across the country spoke of the possibility that 
the high court could return decisionmaking authority on the 
legality of abortions to the states 
it will be total chaos either way said mary newberg the 
president of the atlanta chapter of the national organization for 
women 
the louisiana legislature already has a bill that declares 
abortion centers public nuisances in the event the high court 
overturns roe vs wade

taking ulcer medicine continuously not just 
during ulcer flareups can help keep the painful irritations from 
returning a study published today says 
doctors frequently prescribe the drugs ranitidine and cimetidine 
to ulcer sufferers while these medicines can heal digestive ulcers 
within a month or two they usually come back 
in the study conducted on people with duodenal ulcers doctors 
showed that regular maintenance therapy with ranitidine cut the 
chances of ulcers returning almost in half 
patients who drank alcohol smoked had a history of ulcer 
disease or had duodenal scarring were at the greatest risk of 
recurrence and they also benefited the most from regular doses of 
the drug 
during a oneyear period ulcers returned in 37 percent of the 
people getting ranitidine and 63 percent given placebo pills 
the study conducted on 140 people was directed by dr gary m 
van deventer of the veterans administration medical center in los 
angeles it was published in the new england journal of medicine

a strong earthquake centered in the pacific ocean 
shook islands south of tokyo early today but no injuries or damage 
were reported the central meteorological agency said 
the agency said the quake centered about 50 miles under the 
seabed and 420 miles south of tokyo registered 64 on the richter 
scale it said there was no danger of tsunami or tidal waves 
an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
that on the nearest inhabited island chichi jima the quake 
registered 2 on the japanese scale of 7 meaning slight movement of 
sliding doors was noticeable 
a tremor measuring two on the japanese scale means extremely 
feeble shocks only felt by those at rest 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its 
epicenter according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs 
an earthquake of 6 is considered severe capable of widespread 
damage near the epicenter 
the japanese scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a 
particular location and is not convertible to the richter scale

a man who used false resumes in a 
crosscountry government career has been barred from taking a 
government job for seven years and sentenced to 90 days in jail for 
deceiving an alaskan village 
at his sentencing wednesday carl keyser jr 34 also was 
ordered to pay 18000 restitution he was convicted of 
firstdegree theft stemming from his threemonth tenure as city 
administrator of kake a tiny fishing and timber village in 
southeast alaska about 100 miles south of juneau 
he pleaded no contest in february to the felony charge alleging 
he took 28680 in salary benefits and expenses before he was 
fired in december 
superior court judge thomas schultz of ketchikan placed keyser 
on probation for seven years ordered him not to accept any 
government jobs during that time and told him to write letters of 
apology to kake and pikeville ky where he also briefly worked 
keyser had listed academic degrees he hadnt received and jobs 
he hadnt held on his resume officials have said 
district attorney mark ells said a kentucky charge of theft by 
deception will be dismissed at the request of the pikeville 
prosecutor keyser sent the city 707 in restitution tuesday 
closing that case ells said 
the pikeville restitution represented expense money keyser was 
paid in august during a sixday stint as city manager before he 
resigned amid allegations he faked his resume 
keyser already has served 60 days in jail and asked to have the 
30 remaining days waived saying he had been unable to find a job 
since he was released on bail 
schultz however said 90 days was not a harsh sentence 
considering the crime this is pretty reprehensible conduct 
the judge said of keysers employment record 
keyser apologized for his conduct he said he obtained the jobs 
by lying so he could support his wife and four young daughters 
what i did here was wrong he said i lied on my resume 
because i needed a job to feed my family and instead of doing it 
the right way i took too many shortcuts 
outside the courthouse however he denied allegations that he 
obtained other jobs under false pretenses 
public defender mary treiber said keyser was considering going 
to seattle to find employment 
if mr keyser stays in alaska it is unlikely he will be able 
to pay the entire amount of restitution even in seven years 
treiber said 
kake residents became suspicous of keyser shortly after he 
arrived to take the 44000ayear administrators job in october 
he bought a luxurious 66000 double mobile home rifles and 
1000 rounds of ammunition with city money and refused to release 
his resume for public inspection 
a police records check revealed the outstanding kentucky warrant 
in december and he was arrested 
interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states 
revealed that at least 19 of keysers jobs since 1980 were with 
city or county governments records and the interviews showed 
keyser used false information to obtain at least 11 of the jobs 
keyser a native of huntington wva previously was placed on 
a years probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury 
charge in oak hill fla the charge alleged he used false 
information to get hired as oak hill police chief he was fired 
after four months when the discrepancies in his resume were 
reported in the news media

two women who received fertilized eggs in their 
fallopian tubes through a new nonsurgical procedure have produced 
the nations first births to result from that technique 
the procedure involves guiding a tube through the cervix to the 
fallopian tube where it deposits two or three fertilized eggs 
it is called nonsurgical zift for zygote intrafallopian 
transfer previously the fertilized eggs were deposited through 
surgery and general anesthesia 
the new nonsurgical approach is less expensive and can be done 
more often to establish pregnancy ricardo asch of the university 
of california irvine said wednesday 
one girl was born april 9 by normal delivery according to a 
university spokeswoman one girl was delivered by caesarean section 
on april 12 according to the genetics amp ivf institute of fairfax 
va 
the second girl was premature at 36 weeks but was pronounced 
healthy soon after birth the institute said the girl and her 
mother are doing well now institute director joseph d schulman 
said wednesday 
asch said putting fertilized eggs in the fallopian tube rather 
than in the uterus as is done with standard invitro fertilization 
gives them a better environment for development 
zift is a variant of gift or gamete intrafallopian transfer in 
which unfertilized eggs and sperm are put into the fallopian tube 
to achieve fertilization there 
asch said zift is preferable to gift if the prospective father 
shows a low sperm count or if the woman has proteins called 
antibodies that can attack the fathers sperm 
schulman estimated that only about 20 percent to 30 percent of 
women who go to an invitro fertilization center are candidates for 
gift or zift because those procedures require that the fallopian 
tubes not be damaged 
martin m quigley president of the society for assisted 
reproductive technology said wednesday he did not know of any 
previous american births from nonsurgical zift

lucille balls comedic talent was her 
strongest show business suit but behind the scenes her gutsy 
pioneering spirit helped the fledgling television industry come of 
age 
miss ball who died wednesday at 77 helped to develop that 
enduring tv staple the situation comedy and with her former 
husband the late desi arnaz established one of televisions first 
major independent studios 
desilu as the famed production house was called became one of 
the most powerful forces in early television besides the i love 
lucy series it turned out some of the top comedy shows of the 
1950s and 60s including december bride our miss brooks 
and make room for daddy 
desilu which had taken over rko studios also produced 
successful actionadventure programs such as star trek and 
mission impossible 
as testament to their value as primetime stars miss ball and 
arnaz signed an 8 million nocancellation twoyear contract with 
cbs in 1953 the largest in television history at the time and a 
figure scarcely touched today 
in 1951 when cbs decided to move miss balls radio series my 
favorite husband to television the network also wanted to move 
the show from hollywood to new york where the young tv industry 
was based but miss ball wanted to remain on the west coast and 
she got her way 
the solution was to use hollywoods motion picture facilities 
and film the i love lucy episodes for later broadcast a bold 
decision that changed the face of television in the days before 
videotape 
the show was filmed like a stage play before an audience 
employing three cameras instead of the one camera traditionally 
used for motion pictures 
this eliminated the need to interrupt dialogue to shoot from 
different angles and made the presence of a comedy enhancing 
audience feasible the technique still is used today 
miss ball needed an audience to be funny recalled harry 
ackerman who was cbs vice president for programming in hollywood 
at the time 
when she started the television show i insisted that she have 
an audience ackerman said lucy was a great clown but she 
could only work successfully in front of people 
the multiplecamera filming produced another dividend i love 
lucy episodes were resalable as reruns and desilu was the first 
studio to profit from program syndication the various lucy series 
continue to be seen in more than 80 countries 
miss ball and arnaz divorced in 1960 and he sold the actress 
his share in the company for 3 million with a shrewd business 
sense miss ball built it into a major tv production company and in 
1967 sold it to gulf amp western industries inc for 17 million 
the couple stopped making weekly i love lucy shows in 1957 
in favor of monthly hourlong specials in 1961 miss ball married 
nightclub comic gary morton who became her executive producer and 
she remained on television for another 12 years in the weekly 
heres lucy and the lucy show 
the biggest gamble she took was when she went on without 
desi said michael dann then head of programming for cbs the 
whole program staff was 5050 whether she would be successful let 
alone as successful as she had been with desi there was absolute 
amazement when she became just as big a star as before in her 
career that had to be her biggest challenge 
i love lucy transcended other domestic comedies not only due 
to technical innovations but also because it successfully mixed 
art and life such as writing miss balls pregnancy into the series 
a tv first or celebrating actual birthdays on camera 
william paley the former cbs chairman said wednesday that miss 
ball would always remain the networks first lady 
lucys extraordinary ability to light up the screen and 
brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever he said 
her loss is a loss to us all

leave it to lucy to find laughs hysterical 
sidesplitting laughs in chocolates and grapes 
lucy macgillicuddy ricardo and later lucy carmichael and lucy 
carter could get into more trouble than anybody on television 
sometimes actress lucille ball had the help of coconspirator 
ethel mertz played by vivian vance but she always left ricky 
sputtering in broken english her thenhusband the late desi 
arnaz was her first foil on i love lucy later gale gordon 
was on the receiving end on the lucy show and heres lucy 
in the very first show which went on the air on oct 15 1951 
the ricardos decide to make out wills and lucy thinks ricky is 
going to kill her 
i love lucy got ratings that would make even bill cosby 
envious the ratings were in the 50s the birth of little ricky on 
jan 19 1953 got a rating of 718 and was seen by 92 percent of 
the television audience 
many of the shows involved lucys attempts to break into show 
business husband ricky was band leader at the tropicana club in 
manhattan 
lucys grapestomping episode is one of her funniest and most 
memorable it came during the fifth season in 1956 when the 
ricardos and mertzes were on a visit to europe information on 
individual episodes is from the i love lucy book by bart 
andrews published by doubledaydolphin 
lucy is cast by an italian director in a movie called bitter 
grapes assuming its about winemaking she dresses up as a 
peasant girl carrying a bunch of grapes and soon ends up in a 
grapefilled vat at a local winery she stomps on the grapes to 
make wine and is soon in a grape fight with another woman grape 
stomper 
shes in no shape to play her movie role which turns out to be 
that of a typical american tourist the role goes to ethel 
in 1952 lucy and ethel take a job in a candy factory when ricky 
tells lucy she needs to mend her spendthrift ways the wives will 
go to work and ricky and fred will do the housework lucy works in 
the chocolatedipping section where of course she ends up in a 
chocolate fight with a fellow worker she and ethel are sent to the 
wrapping department and are unable to keep up with the assembly 
line 
another favorite episode came in 1955 when harpo marx was a 
guest and lucy dressed up like the silent harpo the funniest part 
and the best remembered came when the harpo and his lookalike meet 
and recreate the famous mirror routine from the marx brothers 
movie duck soup 
when lucy and ethel tried to emulate pioneer women in the first 
season they made the usual mess lucys breadmaking effort turned 
into a gigantic loaf that nearly filled up the kitchen when she put 
in too many cakes of yeast 
her television commercial for a health tonic left her tipsy in 
1952 she had to keep drinking the tonic for the commercial and 
eventually its 23 percent alcohol content took its toll her speech 
became more and more slurred and the show got funnier and funnier 
the birth of little ricky and desi arnaz jr which rivaled 
dwight d eisenhowers inauguration as president on the front pages 
of the nations newspapers was seen by more people than any other 
tv episode at its time the birth of desi jr was announced at the 
end of the show 
in the show filmed two months earlier ricky rushes lucy to the 
hospital but has to get to the nightclub for his act he gets into 
his voodoo doctor makeup at the hospital then rushes to the 
tropicana he comes back for his first look at ricky jr

konosuke matsushita an inventor who founded of 
matsushita electric industrial co one of the worlds largest 
manufacturers of consumer electronics died of pneumonia today a 
hospital official said he was 94 
matsushita had been in poor health and was admitted to 
matsushita memorial hospital in osaka on april 5 for treatment of a 
cold a company official said 
quitting school at age 10 to go to work matsushita remained 
faithful to the values he learned growing up as the youngest of 
nine children in wakayama in western japan 
he built his global electronics empire from an electric socket 
business he began in 1918 
the company grew into more than 450 companies in 37 countries 
with brands including panasonic national quasar and technics 
sales totaled 303 billion in the fiscal year ending in march 
i have many memories of him prime minister noboru takeshita 
said today he was like a god 
i have simply done common things commonly well doing what i 
should do and abstaining from what i should not matsushita once 
wrote in short i have lived my daily life at the dictates of 
common sense 
later in life he espoused a philosophy of peace and happiness 
through prosperity a kind of benevolent capitalism he preached 
through his own publishing company and a weekly magazine with a 
circulation of 15 million his views were criticized however as 
being a religion of worldly interests 
born nov 27 1894 matsushita grew up in a welltodo 
environment but was forced to quit school and work after his 
father a farmer lost the family fortune speculating in rice 
futures 
after apprenticeships with a dealer of charcoalburning stoves 
and a bicycle maker matsushita began working for the osaka 
electric light co in 1910 he stayed there seven years until he 
quit to begin his electric socket business with his wife mumeno 
and her brother 
as an inventor matsushita registered more than 100 patents his 
first was for a successful twoway socket he invented while 
confined to home because of poor health 
centering around consumer appliances his osakabased companys 
products ranged from television sets washing machines and 
refrigerators to video tape recorders and microwave ovens 
matsushita was known in the business world for his 
unconventional ideas such as turning assembly line workers into 
doortodoor salesmen during a 1974 recession and once advocating

todays publication of one of the first reports 
of socalled cold fusion has met with continuing skepticism about 
the technologys potential to provide a major new energy source 
it sounds like theres a real reaction which is very slow and 
very curious but its more of a curiosity than anything else 
said francis chen an electrical engineering professor at the 
university of california at los los angeles 
the amount of energy produced is so small that while it may 
someday be appropriate for smallscale applications such as 
satellites it probably could not be useful for power plants he 
said 
still he called the report in todays issue of the british 
journal nature about the only reasonably scientific paper that 
ive seen on cold fusion 
the research was done by a team led by physicist steven jones at 
brigham young university in provo utah jones had already publicly 
described the experiments which found evidence of fusion occurring 
in relatively simple equipment at room temperature 
fusion is the process that powers the sun it occurs when the 
core or nucleus of one hydrogen atom fuses with the core of 
another releasing energy 
some scientists believe fusion if harnessed could provide an 
environmentally attractive source of energy in contrast to cold 
fusion conventional fusion research uses very high temperatures 
and complex machinery 
university of utah scientists caused a sensation last month when 
they announced that their cold fusion apparatus produced more 
energy than it consumed 
in contrast brigham youngs jones has said his experiments 
produced only a very tiny fraction of the energy they consumed 
still he and colleagues from brigham young and the university 
of arizona write in the nature paper the phenomenon opens the 
possibility at least of a new path to fusion energy 
they used a series of small jars each holding about four 
teaspoons of a mix of metallic salts and heavy water in which 
hydrogen is replaced with a chemical cousin called deuterium 
researchers applied three to 25 volts to the solution between an 
electrode made of gold foil and another made of either titanium or 
palladium the current herded deuterium atoms into the latter 
electrode where they apparently fused researchers said 
the scientists reported that the apparatus produced a small 
but significant emission of neutrons which are extremely tiny 
particles that are given off in fusion reactions 
john carpenter of argonne national laboratory in argonne ill 
one of the experts nature asked to review the jones paper said he 
has doubts that fusion occurred to the extent the paper suggests 
i take it as a certainty that cold fusion goes on at some low 
level but its problematic as to whether its at an observable 
level that remains to be shown in a tight case he said in an 
interview 
more experiments must be done with additional procedures to rule 
out other explanations for the results such as interference from 
cosmic rays he said

a man accused of being married to four women at 
the same time was sentenced to 27 months by a federal judge who 
told him he would be spending some time in the company of men 
for a change 
us district judge barbara hackett on wednesday sentenced 
victor barr seated in a wheelchair in court to prison without 
parole 
barr 49 pleaded guilty in january to marrying carol kelly of 
pontiac and margaret gearing of cleveland under false pretenses in 
1988 and of defrauding the women of about 50000 federal 
officials believe he had two other wives at the time 
barr conned women into marrying him by promising them money from 
an inheritance prosecutors said they said he paid his expenses 
with their credit cards and repaid them with checks written on a 
phony bank account 
hackett said she was skeptical of barrs claims that he was 
illiterate and unable to walk 
when you are in custody you will be in the company of men 
she told him for the first time you will be without women to 
look after you and you will be taking care of yourself

wednesday by judge nanette warner of pima county superior court 
however pedrins new wife 28yearold belinda hoefert who is 
expecting his child in september began crying softly when the 
sentence was announced and left the courtroom in tears 
under state law the 31yearold pedrin must serve the full team 
because a plea bargain with prosecutors required him to admit to a 
previous conviction for burglary

republican faithful shaken by election 
losses in indiana and alabama earlier this year saw gop hopeful 
craig thomas win a surprisingly easy victory to fill wyomings only 
seat in congress 
thomas a state representative defeated democrat john vinich in 
wednesdays special election by more than 13000 votes 
even thomas 56 was amazed by the victory margin in the race 
for the seat relinquished by defense secretary dick cheney 
i thought it would be close for no other reason than of 
course our campaign started 40 days ago or less and the other 
campaign has been going off and on for nearly a yearandahalf 
said thomas 
unofficial returns showed him with 74258 votes or 52 percent 
to vinichs 60821 votes or 43 percent independent craig mccune 
received 5921 votes while daniel johnson an independent who 
espoused white separatist views got 500 
thomas credited his victory to the voters desire to maintain a 
conservative approach in washington 
i think largely it was an expression of continuation of the 
splendid job thats been done by dick cheney he said and a 
voice for continued representation in that mode of a conservative 
voice in washington for wyoming 
vinich a state senator had won the democratic nomination for 
the house seat after a 13month campaign that ended with his losing 
to us sen malcolm wallop by just 1322 votes last november 
vinichs widespread name recognition was a decided plus for the 
democrat but in the house campaign the republicans constantly 
referred to him as a freespending liberal beholden to outofstate 
labor groups 
indeed labor groups contributed more than 80 percent of 
vinichs campaign funds but the democrat denounced the republican 
charges and countered by portraying thomas as a pawn of the 
national gop which appeared desperate for a victory after losing 
special congressional elections in indiana and alabama 
vinich 38 ran behind as the returns came in and never 
recovered winning just four of the states 23 counties in an 
interview from his home vinich blamed the loss on voters who 
stayed home 
close to 60000 voters that didnt vote in this election 
voted last november thats where the difference was he said 
we just didnt get all the voters out that we hoped would have 
voted

federal scientists will monitor the operation 
of a cold fusion experiment in an attempt to verify that university 
of utah researchers have captured the power of the sun in a test 
tube 
university of utah chemist stanley pons testified wednesday 
before the house science committee that scientists from the los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico will visit his campus to 
watch the operation of a tabletop fusion cell 
later pons told the committee the cell will be dismantled and 
taken back to los alamos by the federal scientists 
pons and his collaborator martin fleischmann of the university 
of southampton in england arranged for the demonstration in an 
effort to calm skepticism in the science community that the 
roomtemperature fusion apparatus actually works 
testimony by pons and fleischmann was followed by comments from 
seven scientists at other university and federal laboratories who 
told of great doubts among researchers about the utah results 
mike saltmarsh head of the fusion energy program at the oak 
ridge national laboratory said all of the federal laboratories had 
tried to replicate the utah cold fusion results 
the results have all been negative said saltmarsh we 
have seen no heat generated by the process 
the utah delegation before the committee also included 
university of utah president chase peterson who urged that the 
government move swiftly to provide federal funds for the cold 
fusion research 
other scientists who testified however cautioned against 
federal support until the process has been verified 
pons and fleischmann received a generally warm reception by the 
science committee but did face some sharp questioning about why so 
many other laboratories have not been able to verify their 
experiment 
pons announcement of the los alamos participation came after 
rep sid morrison rwash asked if the utah experiment could be 
performed before independent observers 
we have 19 experiments being set up now said pons one of 
these he said will be monitored by the los alamos scientists 
committee members also asked why some other laboratories have 
not been able to get details needed to replicate the utah 
experiment and fleischmann replied we are very happy to tell 
people how we have been able to do it 
he said however that those who dont succeed should publish 
in full reports of their failures 
two researchers at portland state university in oregon reported 
a successful experiment on monday in which results of the cold 
fusion experiment were duplicated using specifications and 
materials described in an article by pons and fleischmann 
physics professor john dash and graduate student patrick keefe 
said at least 100 times more energy was produced than was used 
to start the experiment with the energy burst occurring in the 
first second 
rep marilyn lloyd dtenn noted at mondays hearing that 
reports of the utah experiment have indicated the heat produced is 
at a low level she asked if they could achieve a useful 
temperature with the reaction 
weve had a cell warm up to the boiling point said 
fleischmann but he said to scale up to a useful level raises 
many new problems 
we think its feasible but it will require a very high 
effort he said 
fleischmann and pons spent about 100000 of their own money to 
develop the tabletop fusion cell but they said to scale up to a 
larger size will cost about 10 times more and to produce useful 
energy would cost millions 
peterson urged the committee to provide federal funds to help 
set up a fusion research center at the university of utah he said 
the state already has allocated 5 million and another 1 million 
has been raised from private sources 
what level of funding do you believe is needed asked rep 
george e brown jr dcalif 
the figure that comes to mind is 25 million said peterson 
we should move promptly we should have proposals within a week 
other scientists who testified however urged the committee not 
rush into support of the effort 
we need at least two months to evaluate the significance of 
this process said steven jones a brigham young university 
fusion researcher 
fusion research could be hurt if federal money were put into the 
utah effort before it is proven said george miley a fusion expert 
from the university of illinois urbana 
a failure could set fusion research back by years he said 
i urge us to not overreact and put all our eggs in one basket

king hussein today named close friend and 
former army commander field marshal zeid bin shaker to head a new 
government official sources reported jordan was shaken last week 
by riots over price increases 
the new cabinet will act as a caretaker until the country can 
organize its first general parliamentary elections in 22 years 
king hussein said in an interview published today with the kuwaiti 
newspaper alseyassah 
the next government will be a temporary one with a specific 
assignment namely speeding up solutions to our problems and 
overseeing the general elections which will take place very soon 
the king was quoted as saying 
bin shaker 55 was commander in chief of the armed forces until 
last year when the king brought him to the palace as chief of the 
royal court and adviser on security affairs 
he is best known outside jordan as the architect of the armys 
19701971 war to crush palestinian guerrillas who had threatened 
the stability of the state the bloodiness of that conflict earned 
him lasting hostility on the part of many palestinians but respect 
from native jordanians who resented the guerrillas actions in 
their country 
the rioting over price rises last week was jordans worst 
domestic violence since 1971 at least nine people died and 
government property was smashed in dozens of southern jordanian 
towns and villages 
the unrest occurred almost wholly among disgruntled native 
jordanians in the south the wellspring of husseins support 
the rioters shouted backing for hussein but chanted for the 
ouster of prime minister zaid rifai who was blamed for economic 
difficulties that cut per capita income to about 1200 a year from 
2000 in the mid1980s 
rifai resigned with his cabinet on monday after four years in 
office the longest single term by any premier since jordan gained 
independence in 1946 
bin shaker is very distantly related to the king because both 
are members of the hashemite family descended from islams prophet 
mohammed 
his father shaker bin zeid came north from the arabian 
peninsula with husseins grandfather emir abdullah the founder of 
jordan and served as abdullahs closest adviser for many years 
bin shaker like hussein was educated at victoria college in 
egypt and at britains sandhurst military academy 
he joined the army in 1953 the year hussein came to power and 
was by the young kings side when hussein drove out to meet his 
troops and rally them against a coup detat attempt in 1957 
bin shaker commanded an armored brigade in the 1967 war with 
israel and his reported hostility to palestinian guerrillas led the 
plo to demand his dismissal as assistant chief of army operations 
in early 1970 
hussein complied in a brief attempt to placate the fedayeen 
guerrillas but restored bin shakers position on the eve of the 
armys black september war against the palestine liberation 
organization 
the official army history describes him as the principle 
architect of the operational plan for neutralization of the 
fedayeen in 1970 and 1971 
hussein said in a televised address wednesday night that 
elections would be held soon 
jordan last held general elections for parliament in 1967 just 
before israel captured the west bank which contributed half of the 
deputies to the old 60member parliament 
the king suspended that body last year when he severed links 
with the west bank the government recently announced plans for a 
new parliament with 72 members elected wholly from jordan itself

three soviet cosmonauts returned to earth today 
from the mir space station leaving no one aboard the orbiting 
craft until at least august the official news agency tass said 
this is only the second time the space station has been left 
unattended since it was launched in february 1986 mir was unmanned 
from july 1986 to february 1987 while the soviets prepared the 
station for constant occupation 
officials said leaving the mir unmanned will save money at a 
time when the soviet union faces a 160 billion budget deficit and 
will give experts a chance to review scientific data already 
collected 
meanwhile other segments of the soviet space program are 
continuing tass announced today that a photon rocket had been 
launched wednesday 
the program of the 16day flight includes experiments to 
produce semiconductor materials with improved qualities and 
extrapure biologically active preparations in microgravity 
tass said 
the soyuz tm7 carrying the three cosmonauts from the mir 
touched down in soviet central asia at 659 am tass reported 
the capsule carrying alexander volkov sergei krikalev and valery 
polyakov landed 90 miles northeast of dzheskazgan 
the cosmonauts apparently suffering no illeffects from their 
extended space flight were to be taken by helicopter to a nearby 
town to meet with their families radio moscow said 
volkov and krikalev had been in space for five months while 
polyakov who remained on board after orbiting with a sovietafghan 
team had been aboard mir for eight months 
a replacement crew was originally due to arrive at the mir on 
april 19 but tass said a delay with the preparation of two new 
modules forced a change in plans 
the next crew due to take up residence in mir in midaugust will 
bring with it two modules containing a space chicken farm and 
equipment for the production of singlecrystal semiconductor 
materials tass said 
the agency said there would be a biological complex for 
mastering the technology of growing poultry in zero gravity 
the new crew members alexander viktorenko and alexander 
balandin are expected to remain on board six months 
one of the new modules will contain an airlock to permit 
cosmonauts to exit the craft while in orbit and a maneuvering unit 
for spacewalks tass said 
deputy flight director viktor blagov said last week that the new 
modules which would double the stations weight to 100 tons would 
be attached to the mir by the end of the year he said they also 
will bring on board a space bicycle a solar battery and an east 
german optical experiment 
in september an afghan and a soviet cosmonaut were forced to 
postpone the landing of their soyuz tm5 capsule for a day because 
of equipment and crew errors they touched down safely a day late 
but were running dangerously low on food and air 
in december two soviet cosmonauts returned from the mir after 
breaking the record for the longest time in space after a yearlong 
stay

thousands of striking workers and 
students fought police with firebombs and clubs in four cities 
today and dissidents vowed to go ahead with mass demonstrations 
this weekend despite a government ban 
about 10000 striking workers from 12 factories clashed with 
riot police in changwon for a fourth straight day to demand the 
release of jailed strike leaders police said 
workers swarmed into the streets hurling firebombs and rocks at 
police who fired volleys of tear gas and made shield charges 
another 3000 strikers clashed with riot police in the nearby 
port of masan after marching through the city protesters burned 
down an office of the governing democratic justice party according 
to yonhap the south korean news agency 
police officials who declined to be named said two riot 
troopers were seriously injured in changwon but they had no 
further details on injuries 
radical students also clashed with riot police in seoul and the 
southern city of kwangju about 1000 students battled police at 
kwangjus chonam university after burning effigies of president roh 
taewoo and president bush 
the clashes came as dissidents vowed to proceed with plans for 
protests this weekend despite government warnings that police would 
block any protest 
the united national democratic movement the main dissident 
alliance said the government had no right to ban a major labor 
rally scheduled for sunday in seoul alliance leaders said police 
would be responsible for any violence 
we are ready to break down any police blockade if police use 
illegal means to block our peaceful rally the alliance said in a 
statement 
about 30 labor leaders were arrested today in police raids in 
seoul as the government moved against radical labor groups police 
said those arrested faced charges of staging illegal strikes they 
said 
radical student groups which have said they will support the 
labor rally said they would go ahead with a march friday from 
seoul to the north korean border for talks with communist students 
on reuniting the korean peninsula and taking part in an 
international youth festival in pyongyang in july 
police have banned the student march several attempts last year 
by radical students to march to the border triggered rioting in 
seoul and other cities 
the radical students have been staging almost daily violent 
campus protests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the roh 
government the radicals and allied dissident groups lack popular 
support because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat to 
the roh government 
but government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest 
and a wave of increasinlgy violent strikes for better pay and 
improved working conditions student and dissident groups are 
attempting to unite with workers to build an antigovernment 
alliance 
top opposition leaders warned wednesday that continued unrest 
could undermine democratic development in south korea 
dissident leaders claim roh is a front for military rule and 
demand the former general step down roh won elections in december 
1987 after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote

maybe president bush says ann richards 
was right 
the texas treasurer had ridiculed bush at last summers 
democratic national convention saying he had been born with a 
silver foot in his mouth 
bush referred to her remark after he flubbed a line in his 
speech wednesday to a joint session of the texas legislature 
you know ive been thinking about it ann richards was 
right bush said to appreciative laughter and applause 
look i kept putting that silver foot in my mouth all along 
the way he said but the bottom line is when they ask 
wheres george say hes in austin among friends and very 
proud to be back 
ms richards who had a frontrow seat for the presidents 
address wore the footshaped silver pin that bush previously sent 
her 
i thought it was appropriate that i wear it today when a 
gentleman sends you jewelry and he comes to town well you want to 
be sure and wear it 
bush devoted much of his address to reminiscences about his 1948 
move to texas and his deep affection for the state 
raised in connecticut and owner of a home in kennebunkport 
maine bush took some ribbing from democrats during the 1988 
campaign over his claim to texas where his address now is a 
houston hotel 
let me just say a few words about what it means to be a texan 
my credentials bush said i have my drivers license here i 
have my texas hunting license here and somewhere my voter 
registration slip 
and it is true i like kennebunkport but i am a texan i just 
want to clear the air and say a few words about that 
unlike alamo hero davy crockett bush said he didnt ride to 
texas on a horse but in a red studebaker 
ill admit it i didnt know if a chicken fried steak was a 
chicken fried like a steak or a steak that tasted like a chicken 
but ive learned he said

a exxon tanker loaded with 22 million gallons of 
oil lost power and drifted for nearly seven hours before it was 
towed into harbor early today to undergo engine repairs a coast 
guard spokesman said 
the 810foot exxon philadelphia had drifted away from land in 
an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deep seas were calm 
and winds were mild 
coast guard petty officer michael cobb said the ship arrived at 
port angeles at about 1 am today under tow by a tugboat two 
other tugboats were dispatched and traveled alongside the tanker in 
case of problems cobb said 
the us coast guard and the canadian coast guard also sent 
ships and planes to monitor the situation and to be available in 
case of an emergency cobb said it may take a couple of days to 
repair the damage to the tankers propulsion system 
the singlehulled tanker was about nine miles off cape flattery 
and 12 miles west of the entrance to the strait of juan de fuca 
when a boiler tube failed about 830 am wednesday shutting down 
the propulsion system said joe tucker of exxon in valdez alaska 
the crew of 20 never was in danger tucker said 
the incident occurred about a month after the tanker exxon 
valdez ran aground near valdez dumping 112 million gallons of 
crude oil into prince william sound 
the philadelphia built in 1970 was inspected in a shipyard a 
month ago tucker said 
the tanker left the alaska pipeline terminal at valdez early 
sunday to deliver crude oil to a refinery in anacortes about 65 
miles north of seattle said tucker 
it carried 532862 barrels of oil or 2238 million gallons 
according to the alaska department of environmental conservation in 
valdez

communist party leaders warned in a heated debate 
over their losses in balloting for a new legislature that the party 
is in danger of losing both its unity and its hold on the soviet 
people 
in response president mikhail s gorbachev rebuked several 
officials including nonvoting politburo member yuri f solovyov 
of leningrad for losing faith in his reform campaign 
statements of central committee members published today in the 
party newspaper pravda revealed an unprecedented open dispute in 
the partys policymaking body about the partys political course 
gorbachev told the meeting of the committee during a closeddoor 
session tuesday that the election results were a victory because 
they showed the people back his reforms 
the party cannot afford to slow down or lose control of the 
reform process it started he said 
if we lose initiative allow a lagging behind serious if not 
irreparable damage will be done to the cause of restructuring with 
the resulting additional moral social political and economic 
confusion gorbachev said 
the debate took place in a meeting where the central committee 
accepted the resignations of 74 of its 301 members most of whom 
through age illness or political disgrace had lost the government 
or party job that entitled them to membership the move 
strengthened gorbachevs grip on the policymaking body 
solovyov was among at least three dozen senior party and 
government officials who went down to an embarrassing defeat in 
march 26 elections to the congress of peoples deputies 
it was the countrys first contested vote in seven decades 
gorbachev also criticized the leningrad party for a lack of 
openness and failing to push reforms hard enough 
perestroika the program gorbachev launched four years ago to 
overhaul the soviet economy and society remains the proper 
course he said but reforms are not being properly enacted 
particularly by local leaders 
i think comrades and this is opinion of the entire politburo 
that we can no longer put up with mismanagement that literally 
compromises perestroika and does a tremendous damage economic and 
moral to the whole of society 
gorbachev said that in many areas the economy has deteriorated 
and food and housing shortages are increasing in part because 
economic reforms were not fully thought out before implementation 
he said many problems can be traced to wasteful government 
spending 
the food problem is far from solved the president said 
the housing problem is acute there is a dearth of consumer goods 
in the shops the list of shortages is growing 
people see all these ugliest facts of mismanagement and justly 
demand a strict punishment of the culprits not because of 
vengeance but to assert the realization that it is inadmissible and 
impossible to throw the peoples resources to the winds 
gorbachev said 
the states financial position is grave the 58yearold 
leader said the budget deficit is expected to hit 162 billion 
this year economists say 
in one pointed attack gorbachev singled out those responsible 
for particular failures such as importing millions of syringes 
with no needles 
the construction industry has been shoveling billions of 
rubles into the ground and is creating actual ruins building a 
factory to produce detergent is in its ninth year while people 
face daily shortages of soap and detergent he said 
individual workers share the blame he said 
many forgot how to work they got used to being paid often 
just for coming to work 
gorbachev blamed poor agricultural production on the work 
level initiative and responsibility of local leaders 
he said the problem became especially acute after the central 
leadership began delegating some power and decisionmaking to the 
local level 
when people turn to local bureaucrats for help they encounter 
the old atmosphere where every visitor is looked down upon as 
being very nearly persona non grata he complained this causes 
special resentment 
in this weeks housecleaning of the soviet leadership the 
central committee removed 110 senior officials many had already 
retired or been ousted from posts entitling them to seats on the 
committee or its financial arm 
gorbachev said many leaders were caught in an inertia of old 
thinking one generation of party members has naturally to 
replace another this process should be perceived as such 
observers said many of those retired were the socalled dead 
souls holdovers from the era of the late leonid brezhnev 
gorbachev also noted crime has risen as society has become more 
democratic especially in areas where nationalism is on the rise 
he pledged a thorough investigation of the april 9 clash in 
which 20 proindependence demonstrators in the southern republic of 
georgia were killed

israeli soldiers today shot and killed one 
palestinian and wounded 32 in clashes in the occupied lands arab 
reports said 
also today an aide said prime minister yitzhak shamir will not 
offer an alternative to his election proposal for the occupied 
lands now that it has been rejected by prominent palestinians there 
hospital officials said imad muhammad harbieh 20 of the askar 
refugee camp near nablus died of a gunshot wound to the chest arab 
reporters said he was shot after troops trying to enter the camp 
opened fire to disperse several masked youths throwing stones and 
empty bottles 
twentysix palestinians including an 11yearold boy hit in the 
left shoulder were wounded by gunfire in a halfdozen clashes in 
the gaza strip and six palestinians were wounded in the west bank 
arab reports said 
the army which does not include victims treated for injuries 
and released said only three palestinians were wounded in the west 
bank it had no information on the death or the gaza clashes 
spokesmen said 
palestinians observed a general strike to express solidarity 
with their brethren killed in the nearly 17month uprising against 
israeli occupation 
the strike came a day after three palestinian youths were shot 
to death and about 60 wounded most in gaza 
the deaths raised to 451 the number of palestinians killed in 
the uprising eighteen israelis also have died during the unrest 
on wednesday 83 local palestinians issued the first formal 
response to shamirs election plan they rejected the idea of 
balloting before israel withdrew its troops from occupied areas 
shamirs proposal calls for elections to be held to select 
representatives to negotiate with israel on an interim solution to 
the occupied lands the aim of the talks would be to agree on an 
autonomy scheme for palestinian selfrule in the occupied lands 
palestinians fear the temporary solution would become permanent 
this is the best program we can suggest to them said shamir 
spokesman yossi ahimeir he said shamir didnt view the rejection 
as final and would ask us officials to press palestinians to 
reconsider 
shamir was quoted by israel radio as telling an audience 
wednesday night that his proposals were generous and logical 
and that palestinians would be mistaken if they thought they 
could hold out for more later 
in taped remarks from the same gathering broadcast by army 
radio shamir said we have heard an announcement from some of 
our neighbors that they reject our proposals i hope this is not 
their last word 
the palestinians insisted on an international peace conference 
with participation of the plo proposals shamir has rejected they 
did not rule out elections entirely but said balloting should be 
one step in a process toward an overall settlement that they want 
to end in statehood 
in a leaflet distributed today the clandestine plobacked 
unified national leadership of the uprising turned down shamirs 
plan our people categorically reject the usbacked plan and 
the attempts to market it to the palestinians and the arabs it 
said 
underground leaders demanded in the leaflet that arab states 
convene a summit to press for an international conference

a study on the homeless that was funded by 
millionaire industrialist victor posner as part of a criminal 
taxevasion sentence was outlined in federal court 
the 800page study including graphs charts and other 
documents was unveiled wednesday and provided guidelines for 
changes in community action funding and policy to ease the plight 
of the homeless in south florida 
the 267000 study was meant as a guide for posner who must 
recommend a spending plan for easing problems of the homeless as 
part of an innovative sentence that kept him out of jail in the tax 
case two probation officers sat through the proceedings to monitor 
posners progress 
principal author david fike of barry university summarized 42 
primary study points for a committee headed by former dade county 
administrator dewey knight who was appointed by us district 
judge eugene p spellman to oversee the 3 million fund posner 
created 
the 267000 study was paid for out of the interestbearing 
fund which now has a balance of 3015000 said sister jeanne 
olaughlin president of barry university which directed the 
effort 
sister olaughlin said she expected posner would present his 
plan soon 
i think he is ready now he has it in his mind and i think he 
could do it within the week she said it is my impression that 
he wants it to be familyoriented 
posner pleaded no contest in september 1987 to evading 12 
million in federal income taxes by overestimating the value of 
property in dade county he donated to miami christian college 
at his sentencing last year spellman placed posner on five 
years probation on the condition that he pay all of his back 
taxes penalites and interest the cost of prosecution of his case 
and create the 3 million homeless fund 
the penalty package totaled about 775 million more than six 
times the amount posner was accused of defrauding from the internal 
revenue service 
among the studys findings homeless drug addicts and the 
mentally ill with severe disabilities would benefit from 
professional rehabilitation more residential services were needed 
for homeless people with aids prevention measures should be taken 
to keep femaleheaded families from becoming homeless south 
florida lacks daycare centers for homeless children and zoning 
and code enforcement rules could help people stay in their homes 
during rehabilitation and discourage deterioration of lowincome 
housing

one of two american publishing companies that 
planned to display books at a book fair in iran next month has 
withdrawn citing questions about the fairs legitimacy 
john wiley amp sons a major publisher of technical and scientific 
books had agreed more than a year ago to be in the fair it 
shipped books for display to iran soon afterward but had not 
intended to send anyone to tehran 
spokesman leonard harris said that because books already are in 
tehran wiley titles may be put on display but the publisher was 
disassociating itself from the fair because of what it has learned 
recently 
first visas have not been granted by iran to any members of 
the european community or to americans to participate in the fair 
in tehran the publisher said in a statement wednesday 
second iran is excluding the books of some publishers given 
these facts wiley should not be considered a participant in the 
fair it said 
the biennial fair may 719 is conducted by the iran ministry of 
islamic culture and generally concentrates on scientific medical 
and technical books 
mcgrawhill the other publisher planning to participate will 
be there through its company in england mcgrawhill book co uk 
ltd said spokesman donald s rubin 
we dont anticipate anyone going with the books said rubin 
we have an independent sales agent who sells our books and those 
of other publishers hes an iranian national 
rubin said about 50 publishers worldwide would participate in 
the fair 
wiley and mcgrawhill were criticized by the authors guild and 
by the publisher of salman rushdies books rushdie is the author 
of the satanic verses a fictional work many moslems have found 
offensive and that caused irans leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini to issue a death threat against him 
guild president robert k massie said he was appalled that any 
western publisher would deal with any organization in iran as 
long as the death threat on salman rushdie is in place 
viking penguin rushdies us publisher said in a statement it 
doubted anyone could fail to recognize the moral questions 
raised by participating 
obviously we deplore the death threat that was made rubin 
responded but we dont think censorship is the answer to that 
authors should be free to write and publishers free to distribute 
their books anything less than that is a blow to anyones 
liberty 
philosophy and safety both figured in decisions of publishers to 
skip the tehran fair said thomas d mckee executive vice 
president of the association of american publishers 
he said the modestsized fair would have been a low priority for 
most publishers anyway

the jury in oliver norths trial resumed 
deliberating his fate today on 12 criminal charges as it entered 
its sixth day plowing through 363 exhibits totaling some 1300 
pages 
the office of us district judge gerhard a gesell said 
wednesday that all of the jurors were bearing up well following 
earlier health problems reported by several members 
since monday when juror jean johnson complained of high blood 
pressure problems courthouse nurses have made regular visits to 
the jury they also gave nonprescription medicines to two jurors 
who complained of chest colds 
the trial almost 3 months old produced 187 government and 176 
defense exhibits that are in the courtroom with the jurors as they 
consider the charges 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the nicaraguan contras and lying to the attorney 
general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the contras from 
the iran arms sales he also is accused of illegally converting 
travelers checks from a contra leader to his personal use 
accepting a 13800 home security system from irancontra 
codefendant richard secord and conspiring to defraud the treasury 
on seven of those counts if north is found innocent the jury 
also must decide whether or not he is guilty of aiding and abetting 
in the activity another felony 
nine of the charges carry maximum penalties of five years in 
prison and fines of 250000 each the other charges have maximum 
penalties each of 10 years 3 years and 2 years along with 
250000 fines a total of 60 years and fines of 3 million as a 
maximum if he is convicted on all counts 
meanwhile the justice department is seeking a federal appeals 
court order that gesell conduct a further hearing on a motion by 
the associated press and nine other news organizations to inspect a 
sealed trial exhibit 
the exhibit is a stipulation summarizing top secret intercepts 
by the national security agency concerning a november 1985 
ciaassisted shipment of hawk missiles to iran norths lawyers 
used the stipulation in an attempt to show the jury that top reagan 
administration officials knew at the time of the planes cargo 
norths defense of one of the charges against him is that his 
superiors knew hawks were aboard the flight but tried to cover up 
by saying that no one at the cia knew until january 1986 that the 
missiles had been shipped 
the justice department wants a further hearing to afford the 
government the opportunity to establish a basis for denying the 
press the access it now seeks to the document that was shown only 
to jurors the department said 
alternatively the government asked for 14 days in which to file 
a brief with the appeals court responding to the news 
organizations motion 
the justice department noted that it could have contested the 
relevancy of the stipulation under the classified information 
procedures act 
to minimize the disruption of the proceedings at the final 
stages of the case however it agreed to the less timeconsuming 
alternative of permitting the unedited stipulation to go to the 
jury with the understanding that it would not be subsequently 
disclosed the department said

presidents who dont use the media especially 
television to build a relationship with the electorate will find 
themselves without a base when a crisis develops said a panel 
discussing the presidency in the 90s 
presidents win support in these times not because the public 
agrees with them on their ideology or their policies or on 
substantive issues but because they come to like them over 
television lesley stahl white house correspondent for cbs news 
said at the fordham university seminar wednesday 
president reagan was able to weather the crises of his tenure 
because of his personal popularity reagan became adored by the 
public because the white house manipulated very brilliantly the 
media with staged events and photo opportunities she said 
president bush has not done that she said adding i kind of 
respect it but its not doing him any good 
other panelists said however that media manipulation is 
worthless if the president or candidate has nothing substantive to 
say 
that is equally as important in politics if not more 
important said david gergen an editor at us news and world 
report jesse jackson does not attract followers because hes got 
media people hes got something to say 
the point was echoed at an earlier seminar wednesday on the 
presidential selection process 
every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of the 
debate whether its jesse jackson and his working poor litany or 
george bushs acceptance speech at the republican convention you 
can feel the public almost come alive say more please give us 
more said jeff greenfield political and media adviser for abc 
news 
greenfield also defended political advertising as admittedly a 
short and clumsy way to get to know a candidate yet even within 
those limits you pick up something 
roger ailes bushs media adviser defended the advertising he 
crafted for bush last year against charges that it was too negative 
or unfair 
look at trash tv look at the lines blurring between tabloid 
journalism and journalism look at the garbage that is out there in 
general ailes said i would submit that the political 
campaigns are among the cleanest things on television today 
but nbc news commentator john chancellor who moderated the 
seminar said that since presidential candidates are spending 
public money about 41 million each in 1988 we ought to have 
some say in how they spend it 
kathleen hall jamieson an expert on presidential politics from 
the university of texas at austin suggested a nonpartisan panel be 
instituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairness 
and accuracy 
negative campaigning was one of the factors that turn people off 
and keep them away from the polls on election day said ron brown 
chairman of the democratic national committee 
but greenfield said he believed the role of television was 
exaggerated you run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent 
unemployment and you have a very different result he said 
the five seminars wednesday and today at fordham were organized 
as part of new york citys commemoration of the bicentennial of 
george washingtons presidential inauguration

more than 150000 students and supporters of 
their prodemocracy campaign burst past a police line today and 
triumphantly filled tiananmen square defying communist leaders 
threat of a crackdown 
we have created history today history will not forget us the 
people will not forget us a student leader shouted through a 
megaphone to students in the 100acre square chinas symbolic seat 
of power 
trucks filled with soldiers circled the square to act as a 
barricade but marchers swarmed onto the trucks 
they shouted welcome 38th army and handed out leaflets to 
soldiers explaining their demands for sweepings changes in chinas 
autocratic system including press freedom and accountability of 
the countrys leaders 
the trucks were immobilized by the mob and within minutes the 
vast square was turned into a sea of waving whiteandred student 
banners and protesters chanted proreform slogans 
the students did not try to occupy the square but continued 
their march down changan boulevard the capitals main 
thoroughfare they then headed back to their campuses declaring 
they had scored a victory by reaching the square 
while the march was going on the government partially acceded 
to the students demand for dialogue saying it was ready to hold 
talks with them at any time but the statement said talks would 
have to be conducted through official student organizations which 
the protesters have rejected 
the evening television news carried lengthy official comments 
reiterating the governments premarch statements condemning 
studentgenerated turmoil 
the broad masses of students want to promote democracy and 
end corruption that we understand and are in agreement with the 
beijing city government said but a minority of people reject 
the leadership of the party and government and want to return our 
country to the chaos of the cultural revolution 
the 196676 cultural revolution was a leftist campaign that 
turned into near civil war 
the communist party and beijing government on wednesday issued 
stern warnings that the student protests now in their 11th day 
are illegal and further street demonstrations would be crushed 
but students and a growing hoard of supporters pushed their way 
through police barriers across half a dozen intersections along the 
ninemile route from campuses in northwest beijing to the center of 
the city 
when three truckloads of armed police pulled up at one 
intersection they were surrounded by a crowd shouting people 
love the peoples police the peoples police love people 
by the time the students reached the square more than eight 
hours after the march began they were far outnumbered by workers 
and residents had who joined them and the soldiers who had been 
guarding the square faded out of sight 
thousands of people leaned out windows and cheered as the 
marchers surged by kindergarten children stood at the gate of 
their school and applauded and patients wearing bathrobes emerged 
from a hospital to accept pamphlets the students were handing out 
students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted 
long live democracy 
others shouted down with bureaucracy down with corruption 
oftrepeated phrases during the demonstrations and class boycotts 
that have shaken the communist government 
student leaders called on students from dozens of beijing 
universities to march to tiananmen square to protest harsh 
government statements condemning their campaign for democracy 
the government has accused the student activists of a planned 
conspiracy to overthrow the government 
the students have called for premier li peng to resign and say 
senior leader deng xiaoping 84 is too old to rule but most say 
their campaign is not antigovernment 
they have appealed for free speech and press an end to rampant 
corruption in government and more funding for education 
strongly support the good leaders of the party read one 
banner 
the demonstrations were sparked by the april 15 death of ousted 
communist party chief hu yaobang a reformer 
the demonstrations have been much larger and gained far more 
popular support than prodemocracy student demonstrations of 
198687 that led to hu being ousted for failing to crack down on 
the students

negotiations on a global chemical weapons ban 
recessed today with delegates reporting a positive atmosphere but 
no progress on major issues holding up completion of a draft treaty 
french envoy pierre morel who chaired the talks said results 
at the latest 15week session may appear as falling short of the 
ambitions set by the 149nation conference on chemical weapons in 
january 
that paris meeting called on negotiators to redouble efforts to 
finish their work which dates back to 1968 
morel suggested in a written progress report that real and 
intensive negotiations have yet to begin at the chemical arms 
talks in the 40nation conference on disarmament he said actual 
progress would be sought when the conference reconvenes in june 
morel said more than 18 countries have carried out trial 
inspections of their national chemical industries a move aimed at 
helping negotiators design ways to police a future ban 
but disagreement persisted as in past years on precisely these 
provisions for monitoring compliance and on several other issues 
east german delegate peter dietze told the closing meeting of the 
conferences spring session 
the soviet union and three soviet bloc countries have submitted 
reports on national inspections to the conference while the united 
states and britain are among those expected to report at the next 
session morel said 
morels report showed that one problem facing negotiators is 
that poison gas can easily be produced with readily available 
chemicals in plants not specially designed for the purpose some 
western experts have said total monitoring of a chemical weapons 
treaty is not feasible 
negotiators are seeking to complete a global convention banning 
the production use and stockpiling of chemical arms the talks are 
the priority agenda item at the disarmament conference the worlds 
only multilateral arms negotiating forum

the story

invented the story to keep the mothers livein boyfriend from 
beating ms brawley new york newsday reported today

she was 15 when found nov 28 1987 in a plastic bag smeared 
with dog excrement and racial epithets she said she had been 
abducted and raped over four days by five or six white men at 
least one with a badge 
hospital tests did not show signs of rape and witnesses later 
said they saw her at a party during the fourday period 
activist lawyers c vernon mason and alton maddox and the rev 
al sharpton advised miss brawley and her family not to cooperate 
with a grand jury or investigators claiming white officials were 
engaged in a racist coverup 
the grand jury concluded last fall after a sevenmonth

security is so lax at one of moscows major 
airports that people have walked onto the runways and asked pilots 
to fly them to distant points for cash a newspaper reported today 
the moscow regional newspaper leninskoe znamya said people 
pass easily through checkpoints at demodedovo airport one of the 
capitals three major passenger terminals without passports or 
tickets in one case a car drove onto the runway to unload 
luggage the newspaper said 
people treat aeroflot passenger aircraft like city taxis at the 
airport the paper said the airport primarily services domestic 
routes but foreign dignitaries often land there and president 
reagans plane arrived there when he came to moscow for last years 
summit meeting 
in one case a man walked between parked airplanes then 
stopped and asked a pilot to take him to baku 1000 miles away 
the newspaper said it said he offered to pay cash but he had no 
documents or tickets 
at the same airport a car drove right to the plane scheduled 
to leave for petropavlovskkamchatsky on the soviet pacific coast 
started to unload heavy parcels saying to an air hostess that the 
captain was aware of the load which was a lie the leninskoe 
znamya said 
the newspaper said the crunch of passengers at peak periods 
particularly in the summer made it impossible to check documents 
and passports properly 
a person with someone elses passport can board a plane the 
newspaper said it said baggage at many airports also was not 
checked carefully 
in the past year there were 1966 attempts to smuggle weapons 
mostly knives aboard soviet airliners the newspaper said 
at moscows domodedovo airport sophisticated baggagechecking 
equipment was bought but still is not in use the newspaper said 
for a year the equipment has been kept in storage and planes are 
flying with crews that do not know who or what they are carrying 
leninskoe znamya said 
there have been three attempted hijackings this year the latest 
on march 31 was an attempt to commandeer an airliner to pakistan 
foiled by the kgb 
two attempts were reported in january both stopped by police 
in december 1988 four people commandeered a school bus then 
demanded to be flown to israel aboard an ilyushin 76t transport 
jet they were arrested in tel aviv and returned to the soviet

three african national 
congress guerrillas who refused to take part in their murder trial 
because they claimed to be prisoners of war were sentenced to death 
today for four killings 
the three wore olivegreen military uniforms with anc colors 
throughout the proceedings 
their only active role in the trial came tuesday when one read 
a statement that said we are soldiers in a patriotic army 
struggling to establish democracy and peace we believe that we are 
prisoners of war 
in an unusual procedure the mens families were allowed to 
present evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial when the 
defendants refused to do so the death penalty is mandatory for a 
murder conviction unless evidence shows there were mitigating 
circumstances 
supreme court justice marius de klerk found there were none he 
sentenced jabu masina 36 tingting masango 28 and neo potsane 
27 for killing two black policemen a black town council member 
and the council members sisterin law 
the defendents also each received a 25year prison sentence for 
attempted murder in connection with a 1986 bombing at a bus stop 
in which 17 people were injured and for setting a mine on a road 
mainly used by military vehicles 
a fourth defendant joseph makhura 26 was sentenced to 25 
years in prison in connection with the bomb and land mine 
the four had been convicted march 2 
the trial took place in the farming town of delmas northeast of 
johannesburg no execution date was set 
masina read the defendants statement tuesday before a packed 
gallery of more than 200 people chanting viva anc 
we say that the present south african government has no 
authority no moral or legal right to rule over the people of this 
country he said it is therefore our duty to bring this crime 
to an end to remove this illegal state 
if we are hanged our death will not be in vain the 
statement said those who come after us will undoubtedly complete 
our mission in life 
the statement said the anc had not taken up arms until after it 
was outlawed in 1960 and it is contrary to the policy of the anc 
to select targets whose sole objective is to strike at civilians 
without referring to the bus stop bomb masina said there may 
be situations where individual combatants go beyond policy and 
commit acts which cannot be condoned 
under apartheid south africas 28 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs and must maintain separate housing districts 
from the 5 million whites who control the economy the anc is 
fighting to overthrow the government and permit everyone to vote

americans personal income increased a strong 
08 percent in march while consumer spending edged up 02 percent 
a combination that boosted the personal savings rate to the highest 
level in nearly four years the government reported today 
as income advances continue to outpace spending increases the 
personal savings rate has been inching upward and in march reached 
63 percent the commerce department reported 
that was highest level since the rate savings as a percentage 
of aftertax income hit 64 percent in may 1985 
the march increase in income to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 435 trillion was due partly to special factors such as 
profitsharing payments to auto workers a big increase in 
retroactive social security benefits and higher farm subsidy 
payments 
excluding those special factors income rose 06 percent last 
month 
the sluggish consumer spending at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 339 trillion last month was consistent with a series of 
recent government reports suggesting economic growth is slowing 
down 
the 02 percent advance in personal consumption expenditures in 
march was the weakest performance since spending held steady last 
september 
the weakness was concentrated in spending on durable goods 
big ticket items expected to last at least three years 
spending on durables declined 15 percent last month in part 
reflecting weak car sales 
purchases of nondurable goods meanwhile rose 04 percent and 
spending on services advanced 05 percent 
todays report came a day after the commerce department reported 
that consumer spending for the first quarter overall rose at an 
annual rate of 13 percent after adjusting for inflation down from 
35 percent in the last quarter of 1988 and the slwest pace in more 
than a year the weakness was concentrated in spending on cars and 
home heating 
j antonio villamil the departments chief economist said 
wednesday that a slowdown in the consumer sector this year has 
been expected he said the economic pattern of the first quarter 
slower consumer spending accompanied by increased exports and 
business investment was a desirable one for the sustainability 
of the economic expansion 
the bush administration is projected a 2 percent increase in 
real personal consumption expenditures this year down from 37 
percent in 1988 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to relieve inflationary pressures in 
the economy by slowing demand consumer spending accounts for 
twothirds of all economic activity 
disposable or aftertax income increased 08 percent last 
month after rising 11 percent in february wages and salaries a 
key component of personal income rose 08 percent in march to 
259 trillion on an annual basis

an outpouring of sympathy from presidents to 
childhood neighbors followed the death of lucille ball but many 
said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television 
reruns and her influence on comedy 
the daffy redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove 
her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades 
died wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at cedarssinai 
medical center she was 77 and died eight days after emergency 
heart surgery 
a private burial was planned reportedly with no funeral 
services in accordance with miss balls wishes 
god has her now and thanks to television well have her 
forever said comedian and longtime friend bob hope 
hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and 
thousands of cards after miss balls death spokesman ron wise 
said miss balls family requested that any flowers sent to the 
medical center in her memory be distributed to other patients 
miss ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was 
critically ill following her operation last week her first words 
to her daughter lucie were wouldnt you know this is the day 
i was going to get my hair done 
miss ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery so 
her death came as a shock 
she had been walking her spirits were up her family was with 
her wise said she responded as well as anyone could respond 
to that kind of surgery 
he said she woke up early wednesday complaining about a sudden 
pain in her back and in a matter of seconds went into a full 
cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta 
miss ball and her late former husband desi arnaz starred in 
i love lucy from 1951 to 1957 in the groundbreaking show 
still seen in syndication worldwide the late vivian vance and 
william frawley played their neighbors fred and ethel mertz 
probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what i do said 
actresscomedian jane curtin star of the sitcom kate and 
allie but it couldnt be helped because i memorized her 
shows 
the show one of the most popular in television history was 
distinguished by miss balls faultless timing rubberfaced 
expressions widemouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls 
working with lucy was like receiving an ma or a phd in 
comedy recalled joan rivers what she forgot about comic 
timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a 
lifetime 
comedian whoopi goldberg said lucy was great because she 
represented every person she showed us human foibles and gave us a 
chance to laugh at ourselves 
miss goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the 
i love lucy characters to hollywood where lucy and ethel 
spotted actor william holden in a restaurant 
that was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a 
restaurant miss goldberg said she was looking at him in a 
compact mirror and trying to look at him surreptitiously and 
thats just an example of how everyone can identify with lucy 
bob rosati who lives down the street from the beverly hills 
home miss ball shared with husband gary morton said he was 
watching a rerun of i love lucy on wednesday morning when the 
screen went black and the words in memory of lucille ball

i felt i had lost someone in my family i couldnt believe 
it said rosati 40 i was watching lucy like i do every 
morning shes one of the mostadmired ladies in this town 
he was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside miss 
balls home on roxbury drive as florists delivered baskets of 
flowers to the house tour vans passed by in a nonstop procession 
on hollywood boulevards walk of fame flower arrangements were 
placed on miss balls two stars one for her film work one for 
television 
budd friedman owner of the improvisation comedy clubs said 
the world of comedy has lost its first lady her death is an 
irreparable loss to our industry 
actor danny devito recalled getting a personal congratulation 
from miss ball in 1981 when he won an emmy for the tv series 
taxi 
it made it like it had been blessed he recalled 
admirers included president bush in southern california at the 
time of miss balls passing and former president reagan 
her red hair her antics on the screen her timing and her 
zest for life made her an american institution the former 
president and nancy reagan said in a statement just the mention 
of her name brings a smile we love lucy and will miss her 
deeply 
lucille ball possessed the gift of laughter bush said 
but she also embodied an even greater treasure the gift of 
love she appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit she 
was not merely an actress or comedienne she was lucy and she was 
loved 
to baby boomers a happy chunk of our childhood is missing 
said saturday night live comedian victoria jackson who was 
born two years after i love lucy went off the air as a regular 
series she didnt make me laugh out loud i remember she just 
made me happy about life 
said comic tim conway were going to miss this lady but not 
really because shes still here all those wonderful things they 
did together those wonderful tv shows are still available 
although miss ball hadnt visited her hometown of jamestown 
ny since 1956 and had no family there she had stayed in touch 
with friends 
irene rosseti who now lives in celoron ny said miss ball 
recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th 
wedding anniversary

new cases of baby food tampering were reported 
today across england as well as in ireland and northern ireland 
and three babies were treated by doctors after eating food tainted 
by extortionists officials said 
newspaper reports said food companies had paid 850000 to 
extortionists and that the culprits were demanding another 17 
million 
the daily telegraph said police believe a gang that extorted 
85000 from a large supermarket chain this year was reponsible 
scotland yard which is coordinating a nationwide inquiry 
refused comment on the reports 
according to police parents today reported finding glass pins 
needles and caustic baby soda in jars and cans of baby food and in 
one case powdered milk they did not say how many new cases were 
reported but as of wednesday there had been at least 28 cases in 
england alone 
three babies were taken to hospitals in leicester exeter and 
leeds and later released one mother found food glass fragments in 
her babys food and another discovered two pieces of metal the 
third baby became ill when eating a banana dessert police said 
new cases turned up in the province of northern ireland as well 
as across the border in the republic of ireland police said 
hj heinz co ltd and cow and gate ltd two of britains 
leading food manufacturers on wednesday offered a total of 
169000 for information leading to the conviction of the 
extortionists 
heinz whose parent company is the pittsburghbased food giant 
and cow and gate said they had received extortion demands they 
refused to elaborate 
the daily telegraph said police suspected a gang of 
extortionists who reportedly got 85000 from a supermarket chain 
this year after threatening to poison food on its market shelves 
the gang threatened to spike baby food unless it was paid 17 
million the newspaper said it did not name the victimized 
supermarket chain 
the london tabloid today said without attribution that some 
manufacturers had already paid 845000 to the extortionists it 
did not name the companies 
today said the extortionists initially hid the money in various 
accounts with the halifax building society one of britains 
leading savings and loans groups then used cash cards to draw it 
bit by bit from halifax cash dispenser machines 
the paper did not say but the implication appeared to be that 
the gang used false identities to open the accounts 
it said more than 4000 police staked out 768 halifax cash

troops would cooperate with a ceasefire observer force that arab 
countries plan to deploy in lebanon 
in tunisia foreign ministers of the 22member arab league today 
called for a ceasefire to begin friday at noon they did not say 
how many observer troops would be deployed or when but said the 
plan should be carried out immediately

stationing 312 officers from arab armies in lebanon 
the observer force would be deployed along beiruts dividing 
green line and other flashpoints in the hills above the lebanese 
capital according to a text of the committees plan published 
today in beirut newspapers 
its main task would be monitoring the ceasefire and officers 
would have no right to use arms except in selfdefense according 
to the text 
the forces mandate is set for three months but could be 
extended the newspapers did not say which countries would 
contribute to the force 
we will cooperate positively with the arab force on the 
military level aoun said in a statement broadcast by 
christiancontrolled radio stations in beirut 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a moslem cabinet 
that rivals aouns christian military government has welcomed 
setting up an arab observer force but his justice minister nabih 
berri who heads the prosyrian shiite moslem amal militia has 
rejected the plan 
at least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded in six 
weeks of battles between aouns mainly christian troops and an 
alliance of the syrian army and druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party militia 
police said syrian and druse gunners sporadically shelled the 
coast north of beirut with rockets and mortars today keeping 
closed the only escape route for the 1 million christians in their 
enclave

amin gemayels sixyear term ended with parliament unable to elect 
a successor

catholic head of an interim cabinet to rule pending the election 
of a new head of state 
moslem and leftist forces rejected aouns appointment and 
pledged allegiance to the hoss cabinet which governed under 
gemayel 
moslems also are seeking political reforms that would give them 
an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant christians 
the current fighting broke out march 8 after aoun clamped a 
blockade on illegal ports run by moslem militias south of beirut 
jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 310squaremile christian 
enclave the syrians joined the bombardment and sealed off the 
areas land exits

an illiterate unemployed construction 
worker has been convicted of the murders of four prostitutes two 
of which had been listed as southside slayer killings 
louis craine 31 also was found guilty wednesday of several 
counts of sexual assault in the strangulation murders between 
august 1985 and may 1987 but was acquitted on a fifth count of 
murder 
the jury is scheduled to return may 8 to decide if craine should 
be sentenced to death or life in prison without the possibility of 
parole 
it was the los angeles mans second trial his first ended in 
mistrial in august 
craine is one of three men arrested in connection with the 
slayings of 18 women whose deaths were so similar homicide 
detectives believed they may have been the work of a serial killer 
most of the victims were prostitutes who had been stabbed or 
strangled and their bodies dumped in southcentral los angeles or 
adjacent communities 
in march 1986 before any arrests were made police announced 
the formation of what they called a south side serial murder task 
force to investigate slayings that dated to 1983 
craine was charged with three of those killings and two 
unrelated slayings he confessed to three murders when he was 
arrested in 1987 but later recanted on the witness stand 
the defense portrayed craine as an illiterate man of low 
intelligence who confessed during an aggressive interrogation 
simply to tell investigators what they wanted to hear 
daniel lee siebert was charged with two killings last year and 
charles mosley was convicted of one slaying

oliver north possesses a permit to carry a 
concealed weapon in fairfax county va because he feels 
threatened by terrorists and what his attorney calls the nut 
element the chief judge of county circuit court said today 
its very unusual for anyone to be granted a permit to carry 
a concealed weapon said chief judge lewis griffith but his 
predecessor judge barnard f jennings granted north the original 
oneyear permit in october 1987 because he was convinced north 
showed a legitimate need griffith said 
griffith who became chief judge the following january renewed 
the license for two more years on oct 13 1988 a month after 
north reapplied 
north a former white house aide is awaiting a jurys verdict 
on charges stemming from the irancontra affair he was identified 
last july as the target of a potential assassination plot involving 
one of eight man charged with illegal prolibyan activities in the 
united states 
just one other person received a concealed license permit in 
1987 and of 77 applications filed in 1988 north was the sole 
recipient griffith said 
he is the only one that i have ever felt satisfied and 
demonstrated a need to carry a concealed weapon said griffith 
the countys chief judge makes the final decision on concealed 
weapon permits based on need 
papers filed by norths attorney brendan sullivan focused on 
two threats to the life of the former white house aide according 
to experts dangers come from two basic sources the terrorist 
element which wants to fulfill its promise to even the score and 
the nut element which surfaces in situations like this the 
papers said 
fairfax county law allows residents to carry weapons in view 
but those who wish to carry a concealed weapon must go through a 
complicated approval process said griffith 
the permit is only in effect when north is in fairfax county 
where he lives 
its only good in the jurisdiction its issued in said a 
district of columbia police spokesman you get a gun permit in 
virginia its only good in virginia

a mentally disabled aidsstricken 7yearold 
stepped into a classroom for the first time in her life today with 
bows in her hair a knapsack on her back and the cheers of 
supporters surrounding her 
rosa martinez who fought a 2year court battle against school 
officials who feared a health risk called today the most important 
day in her daughter elianas life 
a federal district judge wednesday cleared the way for eliana to 
attend class without being confined to a glass isolation booth as 
required in an earlier ruling 
supporters cheered as mrs martinez and eliana walked into the 
onestory redbrick manhattan exceptional center where 201 
students are enrolled there were no protests 
shell finally for the first time in her life be able to be 
with children and spend all the time she can with them ms 
martinez said as they went inside 
eliana wore a pink dress and pink bows in her hair and carried a 
toy that plays the disney song its a small world 
ms martinez told reporters later that when eliana entered the 
classroom the children came around her and one of them hugged 
her 
they just surrounded her she said they didnt need any 
introductions 
principal sandra williams said she sent notes to parents 
wednesday to prepare them for elianas arrival and received seven 
calls of concern with one mother saying she was not ready to 
accept the risk 
attorney steve hanlon who pressed a suit through a federal 
appeals court to keep the little girl from being put in a 
glasswalled booth in the class for mentally disabled physically 
impaired children drove mother and daughter to school eliana 
became the 12th student in the class 
its a wonderful day for her he said shell do 
wonderfully here shes going to take off like a rocket 
but he said he expected her first day to be difficult because 
she doesnt have any exprience with other kids 
linda castellano a family friend and head of an aids support 
group called linda and frenz was among seven supporters on 
hand to watch eliana enter public school for the first time 
i know shell benefit from playing with other kids she 
said shes always around adults and always having to look up 
now shell have eye contact with children 
the child who had been taught at home since june 1987 was once 
told she could attend class on the condition she remained inside a 
glass booth however the issue of a partition became moot when 
us district judge elizabeth a kovachevich decided eliana posed 
no significant threat to her classmates 
hanlon predicted wednesday that the ruling will have 
farreaching effects 
im just a trial lawyer hanlon said but people who 
really do a lot of this work tell me this is a landmark case that 
it will have a major impact around the country 
in an earlier ruling kovachevich tried to allay the school 
systems fears by ordering the isolation booth for the incontinent 
child until the girl became toilet trained and learned to stop 
sucking her fingers 
but mrs martinez said she would not send her daughter to school 
to sit in a glass cage and appealed 
im so happy i dont have bitterness for anything mrs 
martinez said after the ruling my daughter is not a monkey ive 
always said that 
all she understands is she will be going in to play with some 
little people she doesnt know what school is she hasnt been to 
it 
school board attorney crosby few said he was glad the judge had 
ruled and would recommend that it be followed 
in december the 11th us circuit court of appeals sent the 
case back to kovachevich saying the child must be placed in a 
regular classroom setting unless evidence proved eliana posed a 
significant risk to other children through bodily secretions 
the judge said she learned through recent sworn statements that 
eliana is capable of being instructed not to suck or mouth her 
fingers and that she is well on her way to being fully toilet 
trained 
hanlon and mrs martinez a nurse who adopted eliana as an 
infant in her native puerto rico argued that in order to develop 
fully eliana needed to be with other children for interaction 
stimulation and socialization 
eliana was stricken with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
from tranfusions of tainted blood shortly after her premature birth

energy secretary james d watkins told 
congress today he had pushed back the target date for resuming 
production of a radioactive gas needed in nuclear warhead 
production but he said the delay would not harm national security 
watkins said in a letter to the chairmen of the house and senate 
armed services committees that he was not yet convinced the three 
south carolina nuclear reactors that produce the gas called 
tritium could be operated safely 
i believe safe startup is achievable early enough in 1990 
to maintain a viable weapons stockpile he wrote 
watkins released copies of his letter after meeting in his 
office with a group of reporters he said he notified defense 
secretary dick cheney of the delay on monday 
watkins told reporters the main reason for putting off restart 
of the reactors was a need to resolve safety issues and complete 
retraining of reactor operators 
there are so many issues that are unresolved in my mind as 
they relate to safety he said i will not allow them the 
reactors to be started this year 
up to now the energy department had said it intended to restart 
the first of the three reactors at savannah river site near aiken 
sc by the end of this year it had said quick resumption of 
operations was required to assure an adequate supply of tritium 
which is needed to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads 
the three reactors were shut down a year ago because of safety 
concerns 
the pentagon said last fall that unless at least one of the 
reactors was running again by late this year the reliability of 
the weapons stockpile would be jeopardized 
the exact size of the tritium supply is classified 
watkins also disclosed that he planned to announce soon a new 
approach to determining the feasibility of constructing the 
nations first permanent repository for highlevel nuclear waste 
at yucca mountain nev 
the state government and many environmental groups are strongly 
opposed to the project which has been plagued by delays and is not 
scheduled for completion until 2003 
well probably have to restructure that program in the very 
near time frame and announce some kind of new approach watkins 
said he gave no details

president bush said today there is increasing 
evidence that foreign drugtraffickers are using americanmade 
chemicals to refine cocaine and we should demand that united 
states corporations act responsibly to prevent such abuses 
bush said few americans are aware that illegally diverted 
barrels of dangerous chemicals clearly marked with us corporate 
logos are routinely seized in the jungles of colombia 
while us businesses by and large have supported government 
efforts to curb drug abuse industrys got to do more the 
president said 
and i hope that parents groups and stockholders are listening 
today he said in the speech to the international drug 
enforcement conference here we should demand that united states 
corporations act responsibly and that they not tolerate chemicals 
ending up in criminal hands 
more than 100 striking eastern airlines employees and their 
supporters demonstrated outside the hotel where bush spoke they 
gave a thumbsdown salute as bushs motorcade rode past the 
president who has refused union appeals to intervene in the nearly 
8weekold strike waved in return 
in advance of bushs speech white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said the administration hoped that corporations would 
take voluntary action to determine the end use of chemicals 
they sell and ship out of the country 
but in his speech bush noted that a wideranging antidrug 
abuse bill passed by congress last year authorizes the government 
to take action against the diversion of chemicals for drug 
production he said regulations are now being drafted to tighten 
controls on the chemicals needed to refine cocaine 
the president said the time had come to rid the world of these 
toxins and said were going to start right here in the united 
states because all too often thats the original source of 
the basic industrial chemicals needed to produce cocaine 
traffickers have hit us where it hurts he told the 
gathering of drug enforcement officers from latin american nations 
now were going to exploit their vulnerabilities crimping the 
flow of materials without which they cannot roduce no chemicals 
no cocaine 
bush pointed to the seizure by a 30nation task force last year 
of 155000 pounds of highly flammable ether almost 450000 pounds 
of acetone and more than 50000 pounds of hydrochloric acid 
he said colombian authorities in january destroyed 25 cocaine 
laboratories and enough chemicals to make approximately 83 metric 
tons of cocaine the damage thats done when 83 tons of coke hits 
us streets is pretty obvious 
in a second speech today at the dedication of a coast guard 
druginterdiction communications center in miami the president 
said our purpose is simple and close to home to keep drugs out 
of the lockers the classrooms and off the playgrounds of our 
schools to redeem the children of america from the scourge of 
drugs 
from this site civilian and defense radars will work 
together under the watchful eye of coast guard and customs duty 
officers who will coordinate interception by federal state and 
local law enforcement agencies whether it means scrambling a jet 
fighter a coast guard cutter or speedboats guided by the blue 
lightning strike force he said 
meanwhile fitzwater said bush believes his trip coming as he 
neared the 100day mark of his presidency has gone very well 
he said he expects bush to travel around the country frequently to 
discuss his agenda and programs 
he said bush feels it is important to report to the american 
people tell them what he is doing discuss his program talk about 
various issues bush will often make speeches before the american 
people visit a lot of states 
fitzwater said he expects that the administration will have a 
drugrelated crime package to propose to congress within two weeks 
attorney general dick thornburgh indicated to reporters wednesday 
that drug control director william bennett still was studying 
options to recommend to bush

chancellor helmut kohl in a major 
policy speech today intensified pressure on the united states to 
agree to superpower talks on shortrange nuclear weapons 
addressing parliament kohl repeated his call for negotiations 
to reduce the number of shortrange nuclear rockets in europe as 
well as atomic artillery 
because of the range of the shortrange systems the federal 
republic of germany is affected more by these weapons than the 
other partners in the alliance kohl said 
it is to me selfevident for our friends to have the same 
understanding for our interests as we have shown many times for 
theirs he added 
britain and the united states have been critical of kohls 
proposal for superpower talks on tactical atomic arms deployed in 
europe but nato allies belgium norway and denmark have indicated 
their support for kohl on the issue 
many lawmakers applauded when foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher indirectly criticized the united states and britain for 
their stand 
there is much to fear in this world but we certainly dont 
have to fear negotiations and we dont have to fear talks with a 
soviet union that is ready for negotiations he told parliament 
recent polls indicate that threequarters of the west german 
population favors eliminating all nuclear weapons in europe most 
of natos shortrange weapons are based in west germany 
kohl reassured the united states and other nato partners that 
his government does not want to eliminate those battlefield nuclear 
weapons 
in the current circumstances land sea and airborne 
shortrange nuclear weapons are still important in europe he 
said 
the chancellor also said the north atlantic treaty organization 
cannot afford to make unilateral disarmament moves as long as the 
warsaw pact has a superior military potential and 
securitypolitical risks continue to exist 
kohl has called on nato to delay a decision on replacing the 
aging shortrange lance nuclear missiles that are on west german 
soil until after national elections scheduled for late next year 
hansjochen vogel head of the opposition social democratic 
party called kohls proposal for talks on shortrange atomic 
arsenals halfhearted and repeated his demand that all those 
weapons be eliminated from west germany 
kohls call for negotiations on shortrange nuclear weapons 
appears to be part of a wideranging attempt to win public support 
in recent weeks he has taken a number of actions to try to 
bolster his sagging popularity and to defuse criticism that has 
threatened his conservative coalition government 
kohl has reshuffled his cabinet and has reversed himself on 
several widely unpopular issues abandoning for example a plan to 
extend compulsary military service terms from 15 to 18 months 
while trying to improve his image among west germans eager for 
arms control and domestic reform kohl has incurred the wrath of 
the united states and britain for his proposal on shortrange 
nuclear weapons 
the united states has launched a diplomatic offensive against 
kohls proposal instructing its ambassadors in nato countries to 
present arguments against starting up negotiations on shortrange 
weapons 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain also has criticized 
kohls move and is expected to discuss the matter with him during 
talks in west germany on sunday 
britain and the united states fear that starting up negotiations 
on the tactical arsenals could lead to their elimination and 
increase the threat from superior warsaw pact conventional forces 
but kohl genscher and other west german leaders say the climate 
is ripe for stepping up disarmament efforts with the soviets

express which reported a security bulletin sent by the us 
federal aviation administration to airports and carriers march 16 
about a possible hijacking of an american airliner in europe

would be taken for granted 
after the pan am disaster british transport secretary paul 
channon was accused by critics in britain of bungling the 
dissemination to airlines of warnings from west germany that 
palestinian terrorists had devised a new radio cassette bomb 
flight 103 bound for new york from frankfurt via london was 
blown apart by a tiny bomb hidden in a radio cassette recorder it 
crashed on the scottish village of lockerbie killing 270 people

latest us bombdetection equipment thermal neutron analysis to 
be installed at several european airports by years end the

development of thermal neutron analysis after the flight 103 
disaster dec 21 the first device is due to be installed at john 
f kennedy airport new york in july 
every place i have gone everyone wants to do more said 
skinner who arrived in england after meeting government officials

lottery officials couldnt confirm today 
that anyone won the record 100 millionplus pennsylvania super 7 
lottery but a group of ohio factory employees told friends and 
relatives they had the winning numbers 
officials have said two computer systems may need until friday 
to complete a scan of all 873 million super 7 plays this week and 
perform other security checks before any winning ticket in 
wednesdays drawing can be validated 
george andersen lottery deputy executive director said this 
morning he could not confirm that any potential winners had called 
lottery headquarters 
we get a lot of calls but theres been no claimants so far 
andersen told reporters outside lottery headquarters in middletown 
we always receive crank and legitimate calls all kinds of calls 
even until the wee hours 
at windham ohio janet miller office manager of the 
harbisonwalker brick factory said a foreman and 13 press 
mechanics set out for harrisburg claiming to have a winning ticket 
as she pulled up to the plant this morning 
were all excited about it said rudy palya closing manager 
for a grocery in windham the customers all know and theyre 
talking about it in town and when theyre coming through for 
groceries 
a receptionist at the factory said the workers each spent about 
10 on tickets for the drawing 
anderson said lottery officials would have an announcement later 
today but he refused to say what details would be disclosed 
the huge ticket sales mean the jackpot will be something higher 
than 100 million lottery officials said andersen said the size 
of the final jackpot wont be known until the lottery receives bids 
from a pool of seven insurance companies for an annuity to cover 
the prize payable in annual installments over 26 years 
the numbers picked live on television were 06 16 24 34 35 
37 40 41 45 60 71 to win the grand prize a ticket must 
contain seven of the 11 numbers six numbers carry a prize in the 
thousands having four numbers means a 7 prize 
the drawing went off without a hitch at a television studio 
while crews from at least six tv stations stood by to broadcast the 
drawing to affiliates across the country 
millions of dreams died and hours of standing in line for a 
ticket went for naught when the numbers were drawn some even 
before then 
at the shop n save in butler county northwest of pittsburgh 
manager debbie baron said two customers were still in line when the 
lottery computers were automatically turned off at 656 pm 
at the pennohio drug store in sharon more than 75 people were 
in line when sales ended 
there was one guy who was mad because his friend got in before 
he did and he said hes not getting a ride home and he started 
to leave said night supervisor debbie trinckes of hubbard ohio 
but i told him the machine got cut off before his friend got to 
play and he seemed happy 
at a minimum 100 million the top prize would eclipse the 
previous us record jackpot 699 million for which four winning 
tickets were held april 15 in illinois the worlds largest lottery 
jackpot 159 million was split by hundreds of people in december 
in spain 
officials said the super 7 prize would probably top the world 
record if no winning tickets were sold this week the jackpot would 
then be rolled over 
but karl ross a deputy revenue secretary said the odds against 
the jackpot carrying over for the seventhstraight week were about 
4000 to one 
those who played the lottery used a variety of methods for 
choosing numbers nearly threequarters of all tickets used numbers 
picked at random by the computer 
jazz saxophonist grover washington jr on the other hand based 
his choices on the serial number of his latest album then and 
now 
philadelphia eagles football coach buddy ryan included numbers 
of some of his players including quarterback randall cunningham 
12 and fullback anthony toney 25 
in erie two lottery pilgrims who drove more than 200 miles from 
ohio were robbed of about 850 early wednesday as they waited for a 
convenience store to open authorities said 
as the toledo ohio men waited about 530 am in an 
automobile a man asked what they were doing 
he pulled a gun and took all their money police capt 
dennis tobin said they had driven all night they never did get 
their tickets

a federal judge ruled that the customs 
service must release about 1200 semiautomatic rifles impounded at 
an airport as part of the bush administrations ban on the 
importation of assault weapons 
the decision was issued wednesday by us district judge william 
acker jr who criticized the temporary ban initiated by federal 
drug policy coordinator william bennett 
the ban was obviously the product of a hurryup skull 
session if not a stampede reaction set off by bennett the judge 
said 
acker did not overturn the ban for other rifle models imported 
to other cities but he ordered federal officials to deliver to gun 
south inc of trussville about 1200 steyr augsa rifles impounded 
by customs agents at the birmingham municipal airport and another 
3000 to be sent from austria 
the company argued that the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms approved import permits for the rifles before the bush 
administration announced its ban in late march 
the justice department was reviewing the decision and had not 
decided whether to appeal the judges ruling said spokeswoman amy 
brown 
there was no immediate comment from the customs service 
atf director stephen higgins said in court documents that 
releasing the weapons would undermine the governments policy 
review of the effects of the temporary ban 
acker said the administration issued the ban without consulting 
american gun dealers or foreign manufacturers of semiautomatic 
rifles and without reexamining atfs past approval of the steyr 
augsa 
the ban followed a schoolyard shooting in california involving 
an assault rifle 
gun south owner and president don wood who sued four weeks ago 
testified his company would face bankruptcy if it could not receive 
and sell the rifles it has ordered and committed to pay for 
the company also claimed the steyr augsa rifle is used for 
hunting the criterion on which atf had approved previous shipments 
of the rifles 
the justice department argued that the public interest in 
halting importation of semiautomatic and automatic rifles pending a 
review outweighed any potential harm the temporary ban might cause 
gun south 
this is a small case but a significant example of why our 
justice system enjoys the envy of the world once again a federal 
judge has enjoined the government from violating the right of way 
at a constitutional intersection said james c barton an 
attorney for gun south

housing secretary jack kemp is halting more 
than 100 million in lowincome housing renovation projects 
following an investigation that found former top hud appointees won 
lucrative contracts through a system rife with favoritism 
officials said today 
the report by the housing and urban development department 
inspector general said hud agreed to pay 59 million in excess 
housing assistance over the life of 15year contracts that the 
inspector general examined the report said if the pattern exists 
throughout the program the excess could approach 413 million 
kemp said he was halting all fiscal 1989 funding for programs in 
which contracts had not yet been agreed upon and ordering an audit 
of existing contracts 
his actions stopped funding for 35 projects valued at more than 
100 million while they are reconsidered kemps assistant mary 
brunette said today eight other projects for which contracts were 
already in place will be allowed to continue subject to audit she 
said 
kemp said wednesday that the investigation by the hud inspector 
general found fundamental flaws in the departments moderate 
rehabilitation program 
he said the investigation revealed that the selection and 
allocation process was undocumented ignored existing standards 
and regulations and was based on the perception and reality of 
favoritism and abuse of nonpublic information 
the report centered on a rehabilitation program that provides 
225 million a year for housing in which developers acquire and 
renovate existing projects by winning the contracts with hud 
developers are able to receive lowinterest commercial loans backed 
with huds guarantee of federally subsidized tenants 
the report by hud inspector general paul adams said former hud 
officials and employees actively participated often as developers 
or consultants in the projects 
it named topranking hud officials during the reagan 
administration including former under secretary philip abrams and 
former assistant secretary for housing philip winn who later 
became ownerdevelopers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects 
winn is now the ambassador to switzerland both he and abrams 
are from colorado efforts to reach them by telephone were not 
immediately successful 
the report named several other former hud officials who earned 
money as consultants on the projects after leaving government 
among them was joseph strauss a former special assistant to 
thenhud secretary samuel pierce the report said strauss collected 
13 million in consultant fees on such projects 
pierces onetime executive assistant lance wilson was also 
identified as an ownerdeveloper in six projects 
adams said today he found no evidence of criminal activity but 
that the report was turned over to the justice departments public 
integrity section for review 
we at hud are committed to ending both the reality and the 
perception that huds funding processes have been tolerant of or 
inattentive to program abuse kemp said in a prepared statement 
however the inspector general has assured me that his 
investigation found no evidence of criminality or legal wrongdoing 
of any kind 
the audit was critical of hud management as well as management 
by locally run public housing authorities 
we concluded that the moderate rehabilitation program was 
poorly managed the report said there was little or no 
documentation or accountability for the public housing authorities 
selected by hud headquarters to receive the funding allocations 
moreover the housing authorities selected developers without 
complying with the need for an effective competitive selection 
process and oftentimes in violation of their own administrative 
plans there was an absence of clear written policy and 
guidelines 
the investigation covered the rehabilitation of 35780 units 
over a five year period 19841988 it found favoritism in the 
awarding of the funding saying that over half the units in that 
period were awarded in 10 states which by hud formula were fairly 
entitled to only 16 percent of the units 
those states were florida colorado oklahoma virginia nevada 
utah illinois and louisiana as well as puerto rico and the 
district of columbia 
the report said former hud officials and employees actively 
sought and participated in the program as developers consultants 
or lender representatives of 69 projects examined such former 
insiders participated in 55 it said 
it said consultants received fees of 500 to 1500 per unit 
from developers and that often there was no written contracts 
a perception of favoritism and abuse evolved thereby 
impacting program integrity it said 
the report said there is little assurance that housing is 
being provided to those locales having the greatest need and that 
limited program funds are being spent efficiently and effectively 
kemp said he was canceling all funding selections in the program 
for the current fiscal year that are still pending and that over 
300 projects already executed will be audited he said he asked for 
the hud general counsel to review existing governmental and 
department ethics and personnel laws and regulations in light of 
the finding

fortythree people have been arrested 
in the latest wave of demonstrations against chippewa indian 
spearfishing in offreservation public lakes 
the arrests were made wednesday when large crowds gathered at 
boat landings in northern wisconsin where the annual chippewa 
spearing season began last weekend prior to the fishing season for 
nonindians 
federal courts since 1983 have upheld 19th century treaties in 
which the chippewa deeded northern wisconsin to the united states 
and were guaranteed the right to hunt fish trap and harvest wild 
grain on public land 
critics say the indians spears leave too few trophysize fish 
for the rodandreel season that begins next month more than 400 
people rallied wednesday at the state capitol in madison 
complaining that spearing discourages sport fishing upstate and 
reduces the regions summer tourism business 
tribal members are expected to spear about 30000 fish this 
spring compared with an annual hookandline walleye catch of 
about 800000 fish annually in northern wisconsin 
the chippewa have announced plans to spear at 254 lakes 
five of the tribes six wisconsin bands fished wednesday 
wardens and police have been kept busy this season shielding 
spearers from hecklers said george meyer dnr administrator of 
enforcement for the department of natural resources 
its starting out every night with a crowd someplace meyer 
said 
the chippewa fish at night with batterypowered lights to 
illuminate walleyed pike muskellunge and other fish in shallow 
water

arrested wednesday night for disorderly conduct or obstructing 
police after walking into a restricted area at a public boat 
landing used by chippewa said david kunelius a dnr spokesman 
about 150 miles to the west six people were taken into custody 
at balsam lake in polk county for various offenses from scattering 
nails on roads to disorderly conduct kunelius said 
one man was arrested for disorderly conduct at crescent lake 
where a crowd peaked at about 200 people another was arrested for

the city council approved an ordinance 
today that would ban plastic packaging despite an effort in the 
legislature to block the local restriction 
council member thomas dimond said community concern about the 
citys waste disposal problems led to the 61 vote 
when you see that groundswell were certainly headed in the 
right direction he said 
the council voted to ban nondegradable nonreturnable 
nonrecyclable packaging the local ordinance identical to one 
approved last month in the twin city of minneapolis would become 
effective in july 1990 
a state senate tax committee refused tuesday to remove from a 
recycling bill a provision that would block such local plastics 
bans 
most supporters of the antiplastics laws believe the bans 
should be implemented on a county or state level 
advocates of such bans say plastics take up too much space when 
buried in landfills and do not decompose they also argue that 
plastics might release harmful emissions when burned in 
incinerators 
plastics manufacturers and grocers who say the bans will be an 
economic disaster promised to fight the antiplastics laws at the 
state level and in the courts 
among items that could be banned under the twin cities 
ordinances are foam egg cartons and trays in meat packages plastic 
products shipped into the state such as ketchup bottles and peanut 
butter jars grocery bags drinking cups serving trays and plates 
the ordinances expand on less stringent laws adopted in new 
yorks suffolk county berkeley calif and portland ore said 
council member bob long who wrote the ordinance and shared it with 
minneapolis

william bligh long portrayed as the villain of 
the mutiny on the hms bounty is regaining heroic stature as the 
200th anniversary of the revolt led by fletcher christian is 
observed friday 
the old view of bligh as a bully is largely legend and im 
afraid that hollywood charles laughton trevor howard clark gable 
and marlon brando have a lot to do with it said baron terence 
lewin a retired royal navy admiral 
laughton and howard played bligh as a flogging villain in the 
mutiny on the bounty films of 1935 and 1962 in which gable and 
then brando portrayed christian the leader of the mutiny as 
upright and virtuous 
bligh was abrasive but the mutiny was a flashinthepan 
affair that might easily have never taken place if he had not upset 
fletcher christian the day before by accusing him of stealing his 
coconuts lewin said in an interview 
in fact said lewin bligh was a great navigator a brave 
commander in battle and a fine seaman who looked after the comfort 
and health of his sailors in an age when going to sea could let you 
in for a pretty rough time 
the 68yearold admiral who won the distinguished service cross 
for world war ii high seas action greeted visitors to a preview 
thursday of an exhibition open through oct 1 at the national 
maritime museum in greenwich southeast london to mark the 200th 
anniversary of the mutiny 
anthony hopkins who reinterpreted bligh as sympathetic in the 
1984 film the bounty opened the exhibition and said i 
think bligh was a perfectionist who failed in human relations but 
he was a great character whose strength and vision made history 
the museum show celebrates blighs long career his heroism 
under the command of adm horatio nelson his achievements as 
navigator with explorer capt james cook and his feat of seamanship 
after being cast adrift from the bounty of which he was captain 
with 18 loyal crewmen he sailed a 23foot open boat 3618 nautical 
miles in 47 days to timor indonesia 
a central exhibit is the bountys chronometer which the 
mutineers took to their pitcairn island refuge 
also displayed are blackened relics of wood copper and iron 
sheathing from the bounty which christian burned knowing the 
admiralty would try to hunt him down 
christians brother edward resented blighs published account 
and replied with his own denouncing bligh as a blackguard that 
was the start of what we now feel is the legend of bully bligh 
said helen mitchell the museums exhibitions officer 
glyn christian a descendant of the mutineer said fletcher 
christian was a slaver a lawbreaker a mutineer a pirate and 
probably a fool but there never really was a mutiny of the 
bountys crew 
it was really a revolt by one man against another and i look 
forward to the day when there is no urge to blame either of them 
he said 
bligh had been sent to tahiti to collect breadfruit plants the 
mutiny took place after the bountys crew had spent six months in 
the tropical paradise 
it must have been a marvelous place with all those beautiful 
girls lewin said discipline became too lax and bligh had no 
royal marines to enforce it on the ship which is customary in the 
navy and no commissioned officers 
ten recaptured mutineers were returned to england and 
courtmartialed and three of them were hanged bligh was honorably 
acquitted by a naval inquiry

pressured by consumer and grocer concerns 
over food safety state agriculture officials are about to offer a 
quality assurance seal for produce grown by farmers who agree 
to meet all pesticide regulations 
the plan developed quickly after consumer scares in march over 
the use of the chemical alar on apples and the discovery of cyanide 
in two chilean grapes 
despite the short lead time the california department of food 
and agriculture is expected to inaugurate the new system early next 
month unless a hitch develops 
the language of the quality assurance seals has been under 
review by the state attorney general and governors staffs this 
week to see if it would present any legal liabilities for the state 
participating growers would sign a contract with the state in 
which they would agree to comply with all laws and regulations and 
manufacturers label instructions governing any pesticides they use 
the state will test about 2500 samples of crops from those 
signing up for the voluntary program that sampling financed by an 
additional one cent per box levy paid by participants will be in 
addition to the 80009000 pesticide tests the department already 
conducts on fruits and vegetables each year by far the most of any 
state in the nation 
growers in the program whose crops are below tolerance limits 
for pesticide residue will be able to label their produce with a 
quality assurance sticker certified by the state 
this will give them a seal to use that it is 
californiaproduced in accordance with california laws and 
regulations said jim wells who oversees the agriculture 
departments pesticide regulatory program retailers and growers 
alike feel that kind of thing will help put the publics mind at 
ease 
however harry snyder of consumers union said growers should 
quit using pesticides and predicted that the program will fail 
because buyers who consider pesticides dangerous wont be appeased 
by a seal on produce 
people have the perception this stuff is dangerous snyder 
said well its an accurate perception 
after the alar and cyanide incidents the california grocers 
association persuaded state agricultural officials to start this 
program said president don beaver 
we have no control as retailers what is being used by 
growers beaver said all we want to know is if we are buying 
it and we are paying for it that its safe for consumers 
officials of grower organizations expressed cautious enthusiasm 
although some felt the system should be mandatory instead of 
voluntary or should be delayed a year to allow more time to prepare 
for the change 
the indication weve gotten from retailers and also from the 
california grocers association is that they intend to buy only from 
those who have the seal so suddenly we have some questions said 
richard matoian of the california grape and tree fruit league 
once one person puts a stamp on a box everybodys going to have 
to do it to keep their markets 
iceberg lettuce probably will be the first crop to use the new 
seals because growers report they are ready to sign up now 
the position our industry has taken is they do support the 
seal and theyre ready to start implementing it as soon as the 
state wants to do it said wade whitfield president of the 
california iceberg lettuce commission 
beaver feels food is safe now but because the public perceives 
that some isnt such a program is necessary to help restore 
consumers confidence

more than 150000 students and workers calling 
for democracy pushed through police lines thursday and marched 
cheering and singing through central beijing in communist chinas 
biggest protest ever 
workers by the thousands joined the students giving them 
popsicles and bread in their strongest act of support in 11 days of 
protests 
beijing residents escorted the students on bicycles and foot and 
tried to shield them from soldiers and police who had issued harsh 
warnings against marches 
but the security forces were unarmed and although they pushed 
fiercely against advancing students in a vain effort to halt their 
march they did not use other force against them 
there was no immediate information on any injuries in the crush 
the march turned instead into a jubilant procession for more 
than 15 hours the students marched through streets and under 
overpasses jammed with thousands of applauding people highrise 
dwellers leaned from their windows to watch store clerks stood in 
their doorways and the patients of one hospital emerged in 
blueandwhitestriped pajamas 
the march was the biggest and most dramatic action yet by 
beijing students in their campaign for sweeping democratic reforms 
including a free press and an end to corruption 
in washington the state department called for restraint on the 
part of chinese authorities and hoped the demonstrations would 
remain peaceful 
the united states believes in and supports the right of 
peaceful assembly including peaceful protest and the freedom of 
expression department spokeswoman margaret tutweler said 
even before the march ended the government announced it was 
willing to hold talks with the students at any time if the 
students return to their campuses and adopt a calm and reasonable 
attitude 
however a government spokesman quoted by the official xinhua 
news agency said the talks should be conducted through official 
student groups already rejected by the protesters as 
nondemocratic the government calls the protesters newly formed 
unions illegal 
xinhua later quoted a city spokesman as saying many of the 
students demands such as wiping out corruption were in accord 
with the wishes of the party and the government the spokesman 
who was not identified urged the students to return to class 
disband their illegal organizations and stop agitating 
protest leaders did not immediately respond 
other government statements read on the evening tv news 
emphasized the need for stability for china to develop and accused 
some protesters of trying to overthrow the party and government 
the students have called for premier li peng to resign and say 
senior leader deng xiaoping 84 is too old to rule 
most students say their campaign is not antigovernment and they 
only want the leaders to do their job better and respect human 
rights 
the march was the biggest since the communists took power in 
1949 
student protests in 198687 resulted in the ouster of reformer 
hu yaobang as communist party chief hus death on april 15 touched 
off the new protests 
the government has lost face said one student as marchers 
surged onto tiananmen square the symbolic seat of power in china 
it was not clear what the next step in the protest would be 
the students say they plan another march thursday the 70th 
anniversary of chinas first student movement for democracy 
at least 75000 students from 20 schools took part in the more 
than 20mile march 
the government warned wednesday that the march would be illegal 
and chinese sources had reported soldiers were brought into the 
city from outlying counties 
we fear nothing read one of hundreds of banners waved by 
the students 
the marchers met the first police barricade a halfmile from its 
start at quinghua university but the students managed in 15 
minutes of violent shoving to press through three rows of police 
it was like watching an iron bar bend one viewer said 
five more police lines were breached in the same way police at 
one barricades sent the students through with pats on the back and 
several officers told the youths we understand you we wont hit 
you 
at one point bystanders rushed to surround police trucks that 
pulled up beside the marchers dont hit the students the 
crowd chanted 
a similar scene occurred at tiananmen square when a dozen 
trucks filled with soldiers pulled up in the marchers path dozens 
of people climbed onto the sides of the trucks 
welcome 38th army they shouted handing the soldiers 
student protest leaflets 
students also gave out copies of a letter written in english to 
the un educational scientific and cultural organization asking 
in this moment of top emergency for sympathetic understanding 
and moral support

karen oldhams husband died five months ago 
one of six kansas city mo firefighters killed when they 
responded to a fire unaware the burning trailer contained 50000 
pounds of highly explosive ammonium nitrate 
herb kelly says he has a kidney infection and lung cancer he 
blames on exposure to radiation during his 27 years working at the 
department of energys fernald nuclear facility in ohio 
mrs oldham and kelly are among thousands due to participate 
friday in workers memorial day when labor unions plan more 
than 100 events in 37 states and the district of columbia to 
highlight safety issues in a month of anniversaries of milestones 
and tragedies in job safety 
i think its important to remember the workers who have been 
hurt and killed in the line of duty kelly said in a telephone 
interview maybe this type of thing can stop it before it gets 
worse 
one of the events will be in honolulu marking the first 
anniversary of the death of flight attendant cb lansing who 
vanished 24000 feet above the pacific on april 28 1988 when the 
roof of aloha air flight 243 ripped open 
in bridgeport conn a ceremony will honor the 28 construction 
workers killed two years ago this month in a building collapse 
friday was chosen because it is the 19th anniversary of the 
founding of the occupational safety and health administration 
the events organizers say will highlight what they see as the 
shortcomings of osha and its accomplishments and serve as a 
reminder that an estimated 10000 people a year are killed on the 
job that estimate does not include those who die of jobrelated 
diseases or suffer nonfatal injuries at work 
according to government figures jobs in mining transportation 
construction and agriculture carry the highest risk of fatal 
injury with unguarded machinery trench caveins electrocution 
and motor vehicle accidents responsible for the largest number of 
deaths 
if we are to do honor to the thousands of working men and 
women who have sacrificed life and limb on the job then we must 
redouble our efforts to enact stronger and more effective laws 
said aflcio president lane kirkland who will attend the memorial 
service for the kansas city firefighters friday we will fight 
until the day when the spilling of workers blood at the job site 
is nothing more than a memory 
a study released thursday by a private washington research group 
supports some of labors criticisms of osha 
the agency considered by labor leaders to be shortstaffed 
lost onethird of its inspectors to reagan administration budget 
cuts fails to coordinate criminal investigations with the justice 
department levies fines so small they serve as no deterrent to 
workersafety abuses and lacks the necessary police authority to 
halt unsafe practices the bureau of national affairs said it said 
it interviewed more than 125 prosecutors private attorneys labor 
industry officials and government officials and others 
the 12 millionmember american federation of state county and 
municipal employees has rallies planned in 30 cities to point out 
what it considers another flaw of osha it does not cover 
publicsector employees 
some of the tragedies being remembered were highly publicized 
others received little attention 
in bloomington ill demonstrators will read a roll of former 
workers at an asbestos plant whose deaths allegedly were linked to 
exposure to the product in omaha neb three us senators will 
join workers to discuss hazards in the meatpacking industry 
the aflcio is organizing about a dozen of the events its 
member unions dozens more from northern maine to southern 
california to the memorial service for lansing in honolulu 
in new york bus drivers will pull into the nearest stop to 
honor a oneminute moment of silence and roman catholic cardinal 
john oconnor will lead a special labor mass honoring workers 
killed on the job including two track workers struck by a train 
march 30 bells will toll across the state at 1215 pm edt 
in cincinnati ohio gov richard celeste sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio and others are to discuss contamination at

kelly said hell be on hand he has not worked since 1984 
because of his illnesses the government is fighting his workers 
compensation claim on grounds there is no evidence his health 
problems are linked to his former job

a stage director has caused a furor reaching all 
the way to the communist party central committee by suggesting on 
live tv that vladimir i lenins body be removed from the mausoleum 
on red square and buried 
lenins mausoleum at the kremlin wall is visited by millions of 
soviets every year reflecting the reverence in which the soviet 
founder still is held 
two candidate members of the partys policymaking central 
committee speaking at a meeting tuesday criticized the suggestion 
by mark zakharov director of moscows leninsky komsomol theater 
zakharov said on the weekly discussion program vzglad that 
lenins body should be removed from the mausoleum where it has been 
kept since his death in 1924 and buried 
the mausoleum he and other speakers said should be turned into 
a monument to the soviet founder without his body 
vzglad is one of the most outspoken and popular shows on 
soviet tv and the april 21 live show was broadcast only hours 
after official tv carried a kremlin ceremony marking lenins 119th 
birthday 
to repeat these kinds of questions is it seems to me simply 
immoral said ratmir bobovikov regional party leader in vladimir 
literally the next morning people began calling the party 
committee and in disbelieve asking how are we supposed to 
understand this whose point of view is this he said 
another central committee member criticized the show for 
broadcasting the comments 
why does our television state party television permit 
such statements said georgy zhukov a candidate central 
committee member who retired at tuesdays meeting 
alexander aksenov director of the state radio and television 
committee said vzglad was a live broadcast and no one 
expected anything like it 
he indicated that editors face disciplinary action for the 
broadcast 
although vzglad is one of the most popular shows on soviet 
tv its editors have been chastised more than once for the 
viewpoints expressed on the show he said 
even under the greater openness of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policies lenin is rarely criticized 
on major state holidays may day and revolution day the soviet 
leadership stands atop the mausoleum to review parades 
lenins widow nadezhda krupskaya bitterly opposed interment of 
lenin in an aboveground mausoleum where his body could be viewed 
but she was overruled by the party leaders including josef stalin 
when stalin died in 1953 his body was placed in the mausoleum 
but it was removed in 1961 after premier nikita s khrushchev began 
a liberalization campaign and a reevaluation of stalins cult of 
personality

interior secretary manuel lujan said thursday 
he underestimated the problem of protecting louisianas 
disappearing coastal marshes which are vanishing at the rate of 
about an acre every 15 minutes 
louisiana loses 30 to 50 square miles of its coastal marshes 
each year the wetlands support a billiondollar seafood industry 
and serve as the winter home for about 5 million migratory birds 
lujan was here for a meeting at the petroleum club of new 
orleans he also visited an offshore drilling rig 
at first i thought that all we needed to do was put riprp and down 
the coast lujan said and 
then someone explained to me that was not possible 
for one thing louisianas 400 miles of coastline translates to 
almost 7000 miles of shoreline when the bays inlets and 
peninsulas are included solid objects also tend to sink in the 
marshy soil of the shoreline 
louisiana with 40 percent of the nations coastal wetlands 
suffers 80 percent of the annual loss most of the loss is due to 
industrialization along the mississippi river which robs the 
marshes of the fresh water and silt that used to renew them 
lujan said the no net loss policy proclaimed by president 
bush probably cant be interpreted to mean that an acre of 
louisiana marsh must be reclaimed for every acre lost

vietnam on thursday returned 21 sets of 
remains believed to be those of americans killed in the vietnam 
war and us sources said they expected talks soon on further 
repatriations of the dead 
vietnams communist party leader nguyen van linh said the two 
countries were cooperating fruitfully to solve humanitarian 
issues arising from the long bloody conflict 
the resolution of the missing in action issue and vietnams 
military occupation of cambodia have been the prime obstacles to 
normalization of ties between vietnam and the united states 
a dispatch from the official vietnam news agency monitored in 
bangkok said the remains were turned over to a representative of 
the hawaiibased us joint casualty resolution center the 
military unit tasked with resolving the fates of more than 2300 
mias from the indochina conflict 
according to a us spokesmen a team from the center was to 
have picked up the remains in a ceremony at hanoi airport then 
take them to army laboratories in honolulu for analysis 
the vietnamese report did not provide details but said the 
americans highly appreciated the humanitarian policy goodwill 
and cooperation of vietnam 
us official sources who asked not to be identified said 
talks on more repatrations were likely to take place in the near 
future 
there are 1730 americans still listed as missing in action in 
vietnam while 634 others are missing in cambodia laos and china 
the war ended in 1975 with communist victories over usbacked 
governments in vietnam cambodia and laos 
a 20member us military flew to hanoi from bangkok on thursday 
aboard a us air force c131 transport to pick up the remains the 
team headed by lt col bill jordan was due to arrive in honolulu 
on friday after an overnight stop in guam 
counting thursdays repatriation vietnam has returned 184 sets 
of remains since 1987 when it was agreed to accelerate cooperation 
in exchange for washingtons help in encouraging private 
humanitarian aid to vietnam 
the us military says that of those remains returned since 
mid1987 45 have been positively identified as those of us 
servicemen killed in the conflict 
a team of 10 us military specialists has been in vietnam since 
april 12 working with vietnamese in the fifth joint investigation 
on mias they are interviewing villagers who saw plane crashes and 
seeking other evidence of the missing men 
the investigators will work until april 30 in the longest such 
project thus far 
american experts believe that while other remains will probably 
be found a total resolution of all on the mia roster is impossible 
given the corrosive tropical climate difficult terrain and the 
fact that many died at sea 
the lack of diplomatic relations between the onetime enemies has 
hampered progress on the mia and other humanitarian issues 
but vietnam announced april 5 that it will withdraw all of its 
troops from cambodia by sept 30 and progress on the mia 
resolution has been substantial 
at present the vietnamus relationship is not good but it 
is better than that during the us aggression against vietnam 
linh said in a recent interview 
the two countries are cooperating fruitfully in the settlement 
of humanitarian issues of both sides he said we are prepared 
to look forward 
linh who is seeking to expand ties with the noncommunist 
world said normal relations with the united states would benefit 
both sides as well as peace and stability in the region

health experts told congress thursday that 
third world methods could help reduce infant mortality rates in the 
united states 
approximately 40000 infants die each year in the united 
states said lacey a gude a washington businesswoman who serves 
as secretary of the national association of the partners of the 
americas a group that aimes to foster cooperation among the 
nations in the western hemisphere 
she said health workers in latin america are used to making do 
with little money and to dealing with poor people 
she cited a card that brazilian communities give new mothers to 
keep track of their childrens weight and vaccinations babies who 
die soon after birth are often underweight 
a simple device like this has made a big impact on educational 
programs in other countries and we believe it can help us reduce 
our own infant mortality rates here in the states she said 
ms gude and others testified to the house committee on hunger 
dr norbert hirschhorn testified in favor of the cure now 
widespread in poor countries for diarrhea in babies a simple 
mixture of water sugar or glucose and salt that can be drunk 
such an oral rehydration treatment using rice powder in place 
of glucose is palatable and helps slow diarrhea he said 
he said the standard us treatment for dehydration the loss of 
body fluids is to give replacement fluids intravenously but this 
treatment is expensive and not always available outside hospitals 
hirschhorn is vice president of john snow inc a consulting 
firm 
rep mike espy dmiss chairman of the committees domestic 
task force said diarrhea annually kills about 500 american 
children under age five rep mickey leland dtexas chairman of 
the committee estimated that oral rehydration saves 750000 to a 
million lives every year in the third world 
dr stanley foster said the united states could learn from other 
countries about immunizing preschool children against measles and 
whooping cough 
coverage for measles for children under age two in some 
large us metropolitan areas has been documented to be as low as 
49 percent he testified 
this is lower than in many nations of the developing world

governments international health program office 
dr sandra huffman president of the center to prevent childhood 
malnutrition said that breast feeding is less common in the united 
states than in canada sweden the netherlands or australia

breastfeeding rates in those developed countries all of which 
have lower infant mortality rates than the united statses she 
testified

republicans breathed easier thursday after 
craig thomas solid victory in a hotly contested congressional race 
in wyoming but democrats still claimed a lot of momentum from 
the three special elections during george bushs first 100 days as 
president 
we feel good about two out of three said democratic party 
chairman ron brown 
after a 40day campaign marked by heavy involvement by both 
national parties thomas defeated democrat john vinich on wednesday 
for the house seat given up by republican dick cheney when he was 
appointed secretary of defense 
unofficial returns gave thomas 74258 votes or 52 percent to 
vinichs 60821 votes or 43 percent 
there were few claims that the contest had any broad national 
importance with most analysts concluding merely that as wyoming 
goes so goes wyoming 
its a strain to try to come up with anything of national 
significance said tom mann director of governmental studies at 
the brookings institution 
unlike the democrats who like to beat their breasts and claim 
national implications in every special election we will simply say 
that in this one the best man won said rep guy vander jagt of 
michigan chairman of the house gop campaign committee 
brown noted that the democrats won the first two special house 
elections this year and he said a victory in wyoming would have 
been like winning the pennsylvania lottery 
its the first thing after a presidential election where the 
republicans win and are feeling pretty full of themselves and we 
come in and the first three tests do real well said brown 
the possibility that the democrats might make it three in a row 
had republicans feeling on edge early in the wyoming campaign 
despite the fact republicans outnumber democrats threetotwo among 
the states registered voters 
its like getting a big ball and chain cut said gop 
campaign committee spokesman john buckley of the returns from 
wyoming 
i think we have a lot of momentum coming out of this series of 
three special elections said howard schloss spokesman for the 
democratic house campaign committee 
the president did not campaign in wyoming any possibility that 
he might was quashed when outofstate involvement became in issue 
on both sides 
after bushs landslide victory over democrat michael dukakis in 
november the fifth gop victory in the last six presidential 
elections republicans set their sights on diminishing if not 
ending democratic dominance of congress 
the battle was joined early with a special election last month 
in indiana to fill the house seat once held by vice president dan 
quayle democrat jill long was the upset victor after a campaign in 
which she tagged her gop opponent as soft on taxes a theme often 
used against democrats by gop candidates 
in a second special election one week later in alabama the 
democrats held a seat by a landslide margin dashing republican 
hopes for a show of strength in the deep south 
ed rollins who had signed on with the gop campaign committee at 
a fee of 250000 a year proclaimed the stakes were high in 
wyoming and said the campaign was something ive had my hands on 
since day one 
democrat vinich immediately started running ads talking about 
outside washington consultants taking control of the thomas 
campaign 
thomas countered with ads saying that 80 percent of vinichs 
campaign money came from outofstate labor unions 
the democrat started the wyoming campaign with a big edge over 
thomas in name recognition five months earlier vinich had come 
within 1322 votes of upsetting sen malcolm wallop 
vander jagt chided the democrats for running a willie 
hortonstyle campaign that accused thomas of being soft on 
criminals 
it was not a pleasant campaign he said 
brown said he planned to study polling results to determine the 
impact of the negative ads run in wyoming 
its too early to tell he said 
in the presidential campaign bush succeeded in tagging dukakis 
as soft on crime by citing a massachusetts prison furlough program 
and particularly the case of horton a convict who left while on 
furlough and raped a woman in maryland 
in wyoming vinich ran ads accusing thomas of being soft on 
criminals by voting for legislation that allowed certain felons to 
serve sentences in county jails rather than the state prison the 
ads were criticized by many democrats who pointed out that the 
legislation passed both chambers of the wyoming legislature with 
only three dissenting votes and then was signed by a democratic 
governor

some townspeople wont claim folk singer 
woody guthrie as a native son while others say the town hasnt 
done enough to capitalize on the dust bowl balladeer and lure 
tourists whizzing past on interstate 40 
the decadesold argument is raised anew this week because 
guthries son arlo is giving a benefit concert saturday at 
okemahs venerable crystal theatre 
it will be arlo guthries first performance in his fathers 
hometown 
i dont feel an obligation to push my dad on anyone the 
younger guthrie said in a recent interview his work his life 
can stand on its own time and history have spoken for him now i 
can relax a bit and just have fun with his music and just be my 
dads kid 
theater owner mark smyth said he has sold out the 698seat 
theater at 10 a ticket but he said many of those attending will 
be from out of town 
i wouldnt go across the street to hear it said dorothy 
webb an okemah resident since 1931 im not for it at all and 
im against it 
detractors call woody guthrie whose songs included this land 
is your land a communist and a militant atheist supporters 
say he was a patriot and a defender of the downtrodden 
if youd read what woody wrote youd know how he felt said 
guthries sister mary jo edgmon of seminole 
last week local funeral home director bart webb mrs webbs 
son placed a poster outside the downtown american legion hall 
proclaiming woody was no hero a local newspaper reporter who 
tore it down faces municipal charges 
for years a town water tower has proclaimed to traffic on i40 
that okemah is guthries home but when the ramshackle house 
guthrie lived in until he left okemah at age 17 began falling down 
locals let it go its pieces are stored for possible future 
restoration 
guthrie was born 76 years ago in this central oklahoma town of 
3300 he died in 1967 at age 55 of huntingtons chorea a 
hereditary degenerative disorder 
there are no monuments to him in oklahoma his ashes were 
scattered over the atlantic 
guthrie denied he was a communist and the house unamerican 
activities committee that focused on entertainers in the 1950s 
didnt call him to testify 
guy logsdon a retired university of tulsa professor who has 
lectured about guthrie and performed his music for years noted 
that guthrie served in the merchant marine during world war ii 
woody was outspoken he was a radical in a lot of ways and 
controversial logsdon said most people never considered woody 
a threat to the security of this nation 
woody was very patriotic all you have to do is look at his 
songs 
guthrie wrote more than 1000 songs including classics such as 
so long its been good to know you many have become folk 
standards 
he led a vagabond existence after leaving okemah writing and 
performing about what he saw in migrant worker camps from oklahoma 
to california his songs railed against the abuses of the poor 
smyth an okemah native guessed that the towns residents are 
80 percent prowoody 
but the little core group that are against woody are pretty 
vocal he said 
two or three people they speak out against woody said 
logsdon then there has been the rightwing element it has 
always circulated things quietly against woody 
there will always be those who dont like woody and dont 
know why woody liked okemah he was proud of oklahoma and okemah 
he loved both places he didnt always paint a pretty picture 
because he wrote what he experienced 
logsdon said guthrie would not have been surprised by the debate 
he would enjoy the controversy and would laugh he said 
he had the ability to laugh at himself and laugh at life

a troublefree countdown gave nasa 
workers some breathing room today as preparations proceeded toward 
fridays midafternoon launch of atlantis and five astronauts the 
mission will propel a probe to venus on the first space shuttle 
planetary mission 
were ready to go fly said richard truly the former 
astronaut who has been nominated as nasa administrator the 
magellan spacecraft ready for its 15month flight to venus is 
in good shape said lennard fisk nasas chief scientist after 
an 11year hiatus in deep space exploration he said no one is 
going to question our leadership in planetary flight again 
officials called it their smoothest countdown in 29 shuttle 
missions 
we just dont have anything out there that were worried 
about its been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue 
that way nasa test director ronald phelps told reporters 
phelps spoke as the countdown was halted for 15hours 34 
minutes the hold was planned to allow for any catchup work in case 
of problems but phelps said there were none 
as the nasa crew prepared for its fourday flight three soviet 
cosmonauts returned to earth today leaving the mir space station 
unmanned for the first time in more than two years three of the 
cosmonauts had been in orbit for five months the third for eight 
months 
when the atlantis count resumes shortly before midnight the 
launch team will make preparation to begin loading more than 
500000 gallons of propellant into atlantis fuel tanks 
the only concern and it was slight was the possibility of 
crosswinds of more than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the 
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the 
launch pad 
shuttle managers assessed all facets of the flight during a 
daylong meeting wednesday and reported all preparations are 
progressing satisfactorily there are no technical or programmatic 
issues weather is expected to be good 
liftoff of the 29th shuttle mission and the fourth since the 
challenger explosion three years ago is set for 224 pm friday 
the launch team will have only a 23minute period in which to get 
the shuttle off the ground because of the need to deploy the 
magellan probe from a precise point in space and the requirement 
that liftoff occur before darkness falls on emergency landing sites 
in spain and morocco 
the astronauts were to review flight plans and make efficiency 
runs in jet aircraft today 
they are commander david walker pilot ron grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and norm thagard 
late friday about six hours after liftoff lee and cleave will 
release magellan from the cargo bay and an hour later a rocket will 
hurl the 7600pound payload on a 450day voyage to venus 
magellan is to orbit the cloudveiled planet and map up to 90 
percent of the surface with a high resolution radar system 
its images should reveal details as small as 100 yards across 
about the size of a football field this is 10 times sharper than 
any previous pictures of the planet 
all our previous data from venus has been low resolution and 
about all that data has done is tell us basically there are 
continentsize mountain masses on venus and that there are 
extensive rolling plains magellan project scientist joseph boyce 
said friday 
we dont know whether venus ever had oceans we dont know how 
venus rids itself of its internal heat and we dont know if venus 
is still volcanically active he said magellans goal is to 
answer these questions and improve on our knowledge of the 
geophysical and geological properties of venus and the nature of 
processes that shape its surface 
boyce said the images could help scientists understand how earth 
and its sister planet venus evolved so differently even though 
they basically were identical when formed at the beginning of the 
solar system 
the surface temperature on venus is 900 degrees fahrenheit and 
its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of earths the 
atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and a thick 
cloud of sulfuric acid drops 
john h gerpheide magellan project manager said the 550 
million magellan mission will mark the beginning of a big year 
for the planetary program 
in august the voyager spacecraft will fly by neptune and in 
october well launch galileo to jupiter he told reporters 
wednesday 
so after an 11year gap in the planetary program were 
anxious to get started he said we have our team in place 
and the butterflies are soon to arrive 
the last planetary mission launched by the united states was the 
1978 pioneervenus probe voyager 2 launched in 1977 will take 
the first closeup look at distant neptune in august after earlier 
exploring jupiter saturn and uranus

the government said thursday that consumer 
spending rose a slim 02 percent in march its weakest performance 
in six months and a sign analysts said that consumers are 
contributing to an economic slowdown 
the sluggish spending came even as personal income rose a strong 
08 percent that combination boosted the personal savings rate to 
its highest level in nearly four years the commerce department 
reported 
analysts said thursdays reports provided new confirmation that 
the economic acceleration is slowing and that consumers are helping 
apply the brakes 
it is consistent with this view of the wary consumer of 
consumers not being sure that their paychecks are going to stretch 
to cover the rising costs of things in their budgets said 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington mass 
personal income in march rose sharply to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 435 trillion after advances of 1 percent in 
february and 17 percent in january 
personal spending meanwhile edged up to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 339 trillion after gains of 05 percent in 
february and 07 percent in january last months 02 percent 
advance was the weakest performance since spending held steady in 
september 
with the advances in income consistently outstripping the gains 
in spending the personal savings rate has been edging up and in 
march hit 63 percent the highest level since it was at 64 
percent in may 1985 
the savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income 
has been on the increase since it hit a 40year low of 32 percent 
in 1987 last year the savings rate was 42 percent in january 
it was 51 percent in february 58 percent 
analysts cautioned however that the savings rate has been 
inflated in recent months by strong farm income and slower sales of 
autos and other expensive items that have a disproportionate effect 
on the rate 
the march increase in personal income was due partly to special 
factors including profitsharing payments to auto workers a big 
increase in retroactive social security benefits and farm subsidies 
even excluding those factors however income rose a solid 06 
percent 
the weakness in spending was concentrated in purchases of 
durable goods big ticket items expected to last at least three 
years spending on durables declined 15 percent last month 
largely due to slow auto sales 
purchases of nondurable goods meanwhile rose 04 percent 
spending on services advanced 05 percent 
with consumer spending accounting for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity any slowing trend there can be widely felt 
however economist michael evans head of a washington 
consulting firm said that so far in the slowdown consumers are 
contributing a little bit but theyre not the main reason 
added sandra shaber of the futures group in washington 
a major slowdown in consumer spending can tip the economy into 
a recession but i dont think its going to be consumers who will 
do that 
many analysts expect smaller advances in exports and business 
investment to play a big role in slowing the economy this year 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to relieve inflationary pressures by 
restraining economic growth 
more information about inflation became available thursday when 
the labor department reported that the prices americans paid for 
imported goods rose 17 percent in the first quarter while prices 
of us goods sold overseas advanced 14 percent 
data resources economist nigel gault said the increases are 
consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as a 
whole are getting close to full capacity at their factories a 
condition that can create shortages and bottlenecks that drive up 
prices 
gault said it will take some time for the tightening of 
monetary policy in the us and in other industrialized countries 
to slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact on 
the inflation rate 
on wednesday the commerce department reported that consumer 
spending for the first quarter overall rose at an annual rate of 
13 percent after adjusting for inflation down from 35 percent in 
the last quarter of 1988 and the slowest pace in more than a year 
j antonio villamil the departments chief economist said the 
economic pattern of the first quarter slower consumer spending 
accompanied by increased exports and business investment was a 
desirable one for the sustainability of the economic expansion 
the bush administration is projecting a 20 percent increase in 
real personal spending this year down from 37 percent in 1988

a clerical error caused united airlines to fail 
to follow federal requirements in inspecting the cargo door that 
blew off the jumbo jetliner two months later killing nine people 
the company said today 
robert doll united vice president for technical services told 
federal investigators wednesday the airline was unaware it had to 
inspect the locking mechanism after the cargo door was repaired 
dec 23 in chicago 
doll clarified his statement today saying a partial inspection 
was made although it was not as thorough as the federal aviation 
administration required company repairmen were satisfied the door 
was operating properly he said 
company officials stressed that the boeing 747 door had been 
inspected in november 1988 three months before the accident and 
no problems were found 
a boeing co engineer testified today that the plane 
manufacturer had no idea why on feb 24 the door and part of the 
fuselage tore off as united flight 811 was climbing to 23000 feet 
85 miles southwest of honolulu 
boeing engineering manager james fitzgerald also told the 
national transportation safety board the company had made no 
projections about the effects of a cargodoor loss 
the doors are not designed to come off the airplane 
fitzgerald said we had no way of knowing exactly what would 
happen if a door came open in flight 
fitzgerald refused to speculate on how the accident happened 
he came under extensive questioning from capt douglas robinson 
of the air line pilots association who criticized boeings 
contention that the door is safe in the wake of the united accident 
and a 1987 incident when a door partly opened in midflight on a 
pan am flight 
we cannot explain the pan american incident and we have the 
united accident where the door failed but we steadfastly are 
saying the door is safe robinson said 
he also noted that the two known failures of 747 cargo doors 
both involved forward cargo doors and advised the company to study 
why 
fitzgerald also said boeing is looking at ways to improve the 
warning system to ensure the cargo doors are closed before takeoff 
but has not determined what to do or even if changes in the present 
systms are necessary 
dolls testimony wednesday came during a day when united 
officials were grilled about the operation and maintenance of the 
800pound cargo doors speculation has focused on a possible 
malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door which 
remains on the bottom of the pacific 
the plane was bound for sydney australia with 337 passengers 
and a crew of 18 
after the pan am incident the faa proposed new rules requiring 
that lock mechanisms of all 747s be visually inspected for signs of 
wear by july 31 1988 said united spokesman robert doughty 
united inspected all 31 of its 747s and found no problems 
doughty said 
the faa also required that aluminum parts of locking mechanisms 
be reinforced with steel which united also began to perform 
but a clerical error caused the company to miss a third 
requirement regarding cargo doors that had been opened and closed 
manually because of a problem with the electrical system 
that requirement was that once those doors were repaired they 
had to be reinspected for damage doughty said 
a clerk who retyped the message from boeing co the aircraft 
manufacturer into uniteds internal communication system 
apparently dropped six key words doll told the board 
the note with the words that were dropped in parentheses read 
the special procedures for manual door operation must be 
continued and performed prior to takeoff following each operation 
of the door until electrical restoration and operations are 
resumed and reinspection of the lock sectors has been accomplished 
 
it was a clerical error doughty said 
the cargo door of the 747 developed electrical problems during 
flights over the pacific in december 1988 and the door was 
operated manually for more than a week before repairs were made in 
chicago company officials said 
doll told investigators he would like to see the door raised 
from 17000 feet of water but the safety board has made no 
decision on that yet 
doll also said he is unconvinced the locking machanism was the 
culprit because united has had no similar problems 
he told investigators the 747 did not have a history of unusual 
cargo door problems and that united recorded 112 problems with 
forward and aft cargo doors in all of its 747s from march 1986 to 
february 1989 eight of those were on the illfated plane he said

japans governing party broke with tradition 
defied an opposition boycott and rushed the budget through a 
parliamentary committee thursday indicating prime minister noboru 
takeshita will leave office soon 
also on thursday an advisory board recommended an overhaul of 
political fundraising regulations to avoid the type of conflict of 
interest and influencepeddling charges that destroyed takeshitas 
career 
a separate panel urged all lawmakers be banned from stock 
trading make public disclosures of their assets and stop 
traditional gifts of money at funeral and weddings 
under intense political pressure takeshita took responsibility 
tuesday for a bribery and influencepeddling scandal and said he 
will resign after final passage of the budget 
that has prompted the governing liberal democrats to rush 
legislation through parliament over an opposition boycott and 
despite japans traditional emphasis on consensus 
the partydominated budget committee of the lower house rammed 
through approval of the budget in one minute thursday and party 
leaders are expected to push the issue through the full lower house 
on friday 
that means takeshita apparently will step down in may the 
budget automatically goes into effect within 30 days of lower house 
approval if not rejected by the upper house the governing liberal 
democrats have a majority in both houses 
opposition party leaders denounced the rushed committee vote as 
an act of desperation 
this outrage treads parliamentary democracy under foot and 
cannot be forgiven said lawmaker shun oide of the socialist 
party the leading opposition party 
the budget action is the final act of political harikari for 
takeshita said political analyst and author asao yamaguchi he 
is offering himself as a sacrifice but this will just increase the 
peoples distrust of the liberal democrats 
the opposition has boycotted budget debate demanding new 
parliamentary elections and a broad investigation of the scandal 
surrounding the purchase by business and political leaders of 
unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the recruit co an information 
and publishing conglomerate the shares soared in value when they 
went on the market 
prosecutors contend at least some of the stock transactions 
amounted to bribery by recruit to try to influence government 
policy fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on 
bribery and securities law violation charges 
the company also made huge political donations takeshita 
acknowledged receiving more than 1 million in donations 
while a panel of the prime minister recommended new rules on 
fundraising another panel of members of the private and academic 
sectors recommended widespread changes in japans bigmoney 
politics including requiring all legislators to disclose their 
assets and stop traditional monetary gifts 
only cabinet members now must divulge their assets there are no 
restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on stocks and 
politicians routinely spend huge sums on wedding and funeral 
offerings to their constituents 
analysts say masayoshi ito 75 head of the liberal democrats 
executive council and a former foreign minister will likely 
replace takeshita and lead a caretaker government 
ito told reporters chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi 
takeshitas main lieutenant asked him early thursday to accept 
takeshitas job 
later thursday the japan broadcasting corp reported ito 
received the backing of his party faction headed by former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa 
ito has insisted he will not accept the post due to a heart 
condition caused by diabetes many analysts say his public denials 
are a facade 
it would be unjapanese for him to come out and say hell take 
the job said keiichiro nakamura an aide to former prime 
minister takeo miki nakamura said ito will accept once the 
proper atmosphere has been created 
the party was shocked wednesday by the suicide of a takeshita 
aide who handled the prime ministers political funds stock 
dealings and a 384000 loan from recruit were carried out in the 
name of the aide ihei aoki 
aoki was among more than a dozen politicians and political aides 
who profited from recruit stock more than 150 political business 
and media figures purchased such shares

the navy has arrived to help in an assault 
on gummedup beaches and bays more than doubling cleanup efforts 
five weeks after the nations worst oil spill fouled prince william 
sound 
after loading workers and supplies in valdez the uss juneau was 
anchored today near smith island as part of exxons stateguided 
effort to clean rocky beaches where seals and sea lions have their 
pups 
the juneau allows us to accelerate the pace of the cleanup 
thats key said exxon spokesman joe tucker 
the top state environmental official today disputed exxons 
estimate of how the cleanup is going saying more study was needed 
before concluding that just 10 percent of the oil remained 
unaccountedfor exxon had stated that 17 percent of the spilled 
oil had been recovered and 73 percent has dissipated 
its important for our credibility we want to make sure we 
take all the steps necessary to make an assessment even if exxon 
is willing to go out on a limb and provide you with figures that 
may be both gross and inaccurate alaskas environmental 
commissioner dennis kelso said 
the state also revised its estimate of the total amount of oil 
spilled downward to 109 million gallons from 112 million 
gallons exxons estimate of the oil spill remains 101 million 
gallons 
the arrival of the juneau could spell good news for marine 
mammals in the sound where the most heavily oiled beaches are 
the ship carries nine landing craft tucker said of the 
juneau each will be equipped by exxon with pumps and heaters 
enabling the company to transport crews to work areas more quickly 
the crew will just stay out there 
the landing transport is carrying 400 workers who were to get 
off each morning and return to sleep at night about 250 workers 
who had been cleaning eleanor island today moved to green island 
most of them sleep on barges nearby 
after three days of 15to20foot seas and galeforce winds 
whipping snow in some areas skimmers returned to work wednesday in 
the sound and the gulf of alaska todays forecast called for light 
rain and wind and seas of three feet 
confirmed reports have placed the oil at cape douglas on the 
alaska peninsula 275 miles west of where the exxon valdez ran 
aground on bligh reef on march 24 in a picturesque area rich in 
marine life 
neither exxon which conducts daily overflights of the area nor 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration could confirm a 
report by a national park service officer that oil was spotted 100 
miles south of cape douglas at kashvik bay on the alaska peninsula 
the spreading oil sheen has crept into energy politics as well 
as the coves that make up kenai fjords national park 100 miles 
south of anchorage 
a letter to the house interior committee released wednesday by 
gov steve cowper urged congress to buy back oil exploration leases 
sold for bristol bay an area cowper said produces 1 billion a 
year in seafood 
alaskans already have had to face the closure of this years 
multimilliondollar prince william sound herring fishery and black 
cod fishery and the attendant loss of jobs and community 
stability cowper wrote 
the spector of such an event in bristol bay is unthinkable 
cowper said it is time to cancel the sale and refund the bid 
money 
but president bush speaking in austin to a joint session of the 
texas legislature warned that the nation must not retreat from oil 
exploration because of the spill 
we are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanup 
effort he said we are working with industry to develop an 
improved plan in the event of a future spill 
but shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer 
and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil bush 
said to avoid that we must return to high levels of exploratory 
drilling 
while some wildlife has moved out of oiled areas bald eagles 
and other scavengers have been drawn to it said walt steiglitz 
regional director for the us fish amp wildlife service 
steiglitz said in a news release that eagles and gulls that have 
moved in to feed on the carrion will become secondary victims of 
the oil by contamination through the food chain four eagles have 
been reported dead

energy secretary james d watkins said 
thursday he has moved back the timetable for resuming production of 
a scarce gas needed to make nuclear warheads he assured congress 
the delay would not weaken the national defense 
watkins said he hoped to restart production at the savannah 
river reactors near aiken sc early in 1990 the three 
reactors which have been plagued by safety and technical flaws 
are the nations only source of tritium a perishable radioactive 
gas that boosts the explosive power of warheads 
more retraining of reactor operators and a fuller assessment of 
other safety issues are needed before the plant can be allowed to 
resume operation watkins said 
because of the attention im giving to safety health and the 
environment i have said unequivocally i will not allow them to 
be started this year as previously planned watkins told 
reporters at a meeting in his office 
shortly after the reactors were shut down for safety reasons 
last summer the department said it could have them running again 
by late 1988 after that target was missed the department told 
congress it expected startup by late this year 
watkins also disclosed in a meeting with reporters that he 
planned to announce a new approach to the energy departments 
controversial effort to build the nations first permanent 
repository for highlevel nuclear wastes in nevada 
he said residents of the state may have been justified in 
feeling they had a waste dump jammed down their throats by 
federal officials who paid too little attention to local opinion 
the 30 billion yucca mountain repository is officially scheduled 
to open in 2003 although watkins planned changes could put that 
date in doubt 
the energy department which builds and tests nuclear weapons 
for the pentagon has been able to continue warhead production 
because it has a reserve of tritium 
the size of the tritium stockpile is classified but the 
department told congress earlier this year that supplies would be 
sqeezed if the savannah river reactors were not operating by the 
end of this year 
many private groups that monitor the government weapons program 
have expressed doubt that tritium supplies are as tight as 
suggested by the energy department 
the initial suggestion that we faced a national security 
emergency is absurd said frances close hart chairman of the 
energy research foundation a columbia scbased environmental 
group that wants the savannah river reactors closed permanently 
she said watkins new timetable for the reactors was overly 
optimistic 
i dont believe they will be able to restart them even by 
early 1990 she said 
in a letter sent thursday to the chairmen of the house and 
senate armed services committees watkins said he believed the 
reactors could be safely restarted early enough in 1990 to 
maintain a viable weapons stockpile he said he had told defense 
secretary dick cheney of the delayed startup on monday 
in his comments to reporters watkins said the department and 
its savannah river field office face a tough test in getting the 
reactors started in time to meet tritium needs 
the race will be a close race but it can be done he said 
watkins said he was moving ahead with a broad strategy for 
weeding out safety technical and managerial problems at the 
savannah river reactors he said this was central to his overall 
plan for restoring the credibility of nuclear power 
i see in savannah river an opportunity to make it the flagship 
of the department of energy rather than the butt of criticism 
he said 
watkins will go to the savannah river plant friday in his first 
visit to the departments nuclear weapons production network which 
includes 16 major plants in 12 states he said he wanted to boost 
the troops morale damaged by months of critical reports about 
the safety and efficiency of plant operations

when a barred door slammed shut behind 
convicted killer martin vega on the steamy row of identical cells 
known simply as j23 texass death row became the largest in the 
nation 
vega whose white prison suit bears an orange tag with his name 
and the number dr 932 is the 300th person on death row in 
texas according to department of corrections statistics this week 
florida which in recent years has held the largest number of 
convicted killers awaiting execution this week has 299 death row 
inmates according to paula tully of the florida department of 
corrections 
its a pretty good indication that the people of texas support 
the death penalty if they keep sending people there said ron 
dusek a spokesman for texas attorney general jim mattox 
texas also leads the nation in the number of people put to death 
since the us supreme court in 1976 allowed capital punishment to 
resume thirty men have been given lethal injection at the walls 
unit in huntsville starting with charlie brooks in december 1982 
by that time texas had 130 others awaiting the same fate as 
brooks 
during the early 1980s death row grew by about two per month 
as the pace of executions quickened so did the number of people 
awaiting death in 1986 43 new inmates joined the ranks while 10 
were executed an additional 36 came the next year and the 
threepermonth average continues now 
but while death row in texas has grown it now incorporates 
five prison wings the number of executions has fallen only three 
were put to death last year and just one so far in 1989 as inmates 
attorneys have won supreme court review of cases 
the way its growing they can dedicate half the farm to death 
row in the next five years unless they do away with the death 
penalty says jim beathard awaiting execution for a killing 
spree in which three members of a family died in 1984 
jim vanderbilt who has been on the row since 1976 and is among 
the most senior of all inmates fears a legal breakthrough will 
trigger many executions 
the water is building up behind the dam vanderbilt says 
and if they let the dam overflow or if they remove the dam then 
theres going to be a flood 
for vega 42 a selfdescribed jackofalltrades who was 
convcted in february of the 1985 slaying of his wifes former 
husband in what authorities said was an attempt to collect the 
mans insurance the move to death row was his fourth trip to the 
texas prison system included among his terms was a twoyear stint 
for robbery which kept him behind bars for just one week before he 
was released 
death row he says is different 
its a title we have and under that title were supposed to be 
dangerous he said in an interview this week but lord knows a 
lot of people here are not dangerous im not saying all but 
some 
vega from luling says he misses freedom my family women 
money breathing the fresh air and just being able to raise my 
hands and say im free 
but the texas prison system mandated by federal court orders 
this decade to improve prison conditions and inmate rights is a 
much better place now vega says 
one prison beating in the old days left him with a severed 
tendon that has left the little finger of his left hand immobile 
most officials i have encountered have been nice so far he 
says if you have a question they will answer since the time 
ive been back here tdc has not bothered me at all its good

environmental protection agency officials 
weakened a task forces draft report that had presented a damning 
picture of the agencys program to protect groundwater from 
chemical contamination a congressional investigator said thursday 
the diluted final report minimized epas troubles in monitoring 
leakage from hazardous waste dumps said richard l hembra 
director of the environmental protection section of the general 
accounting office gao is an investigating arm of congress 
a separate superfund program is for cleanup of abandoned 
disposal sites sometimes in cases where responsible parties cannot 
be located hembra said the problem involving leaks from hazardous 
waste dumps into groundwater supplies could be as big as the 
waste problem which superfund handles 
in testimony before the house energy and commerce committees 
investigations subcommittee hembra and kathie a stein an 
attorney with the environmental defense fund a private 
proenvironmental advocacy group criticized changes made by epa 
officials in the draft report 
hembra said an accurate picture of the groundwater monitoring 
and protection program is crucial because over 70 percent of the 
facilities are leaking and about onehalf the nations 
population depends on groundwater for drinking water 
hazardous waste disposal facilities are licensed to operate by 
epa under the resource conservation and recovery act that law 
controls operation and closure of the sites and requires operators 
to clean up spills at their expense 
epa issued its final report last october on groundwater 
monitoring at 58 of the nations 1447 hazardous waste disposal 
facilities studied by its own task force the gao studied 50 sites 
a comparison of the october report and the staff task force 
draft in september 1987 showed that some of the hardesthitting 
staff criticism of the enforcement program was deleted other 
conclusions were softened 
hembra said while a lot of what you see in the way of changes 
was moving away from emotionladen language other deletions 
presented a pretty damning picture of the program 
ms stein said some of the best technical talent at epa 
sounded an alert about the monitoring program but it doesnt 
seem like epa answered the call 
somewhere as it moves up through the agency the findings 
seem to disappear said rep ron wyden dore the final 
version of the task force report deleted the finding that most 
facilities are leaking 
one deletion was a task force conclusion that enforcement of 
groundwater monitoring was so poor that epa and state officials 
potentially compromise the level of protection provided to the 
public and the environment 
jonathan z cannon acting assistant epa administrator for solid 
waste and emergency response said officials who have left the 
agency were responsible for the changes he asked the committee to 
recognize that new officials are now in charge of the monitoring 
program he said epa has made progress but has a long way to 
go 
the september 1987 staff report said each of the facilities it 
investigated had significant deficiencies with their 
detection monitoring systems that conclusion was omitted from 
the final report 
the earlier report said the task force found that while most 
facilities were found to have groundwater contamination very few 
have any active groundwater cleanup program in progress and none of 
these programs meet the laws standards 
the final report left out that most facilities contaminated 
nearby groundwater and said with respect to corrective action 
the task force found that of those facilities that had groundwater 
contamination few had active groundwater cleanup programs in 
progress 
a staff report conclusion deleted in the final version said 
epa enforcement personnel and managers do not elicit cannot 
understand or sometimes do not heed recommendations from 
qualified technical personnel which would improve the level of 
compliance and quality of actions 
the draft said that none of the facilities investigated has 
characterized the extent of its contamination as required by law 
the final version deleted the none and said the task force 
found that inadequate groundwater monitoring efforts at many 
sites often resulted in unsatisfactory hy

five astronauts tracked a perfect 
countdown thursday as technicians prepared the shuttle atlantis for 
a midafternoon launch on friday the mission will propel nasas 
magellan probe to venus and revive americas deepspace science 
program 
after an 11year gap in the planetary program were anxious 
to get started said john h gerpheide magellan project manager 
officials described the countdown as the smoothest of four since 
the challenger disaster the chance of high winds provided slight 
concern as nasa looked forward to liftoff in an unusually tight 
launch window that opens at 224 pm edt and lasts justs 23 
minutes 
magellan ready for its 15month flight to venus is 100 
percent healthy and ticking along said lennard fisk nasas 
chief scientist were ready to go fly said richard truly who 
heads the shuttle program and is the incoming nasa administrator 
earlier thursday three soviet cosmonauts returned to earth 
leaving the mir space station unattended for the first time in more 
than two years two of the cosmonauts had been in space for five 
months the other for eight months 
atlantis cargo is the magellan spacecraft which has a radar 
system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of 
venus and map its surface the mission costs 550 million not 
including the 225 million cost of the fourday shuttle flight 
magellans radar images relayed to earth and enhanced by 
computer should reveal details as small as 100 yards across about 
the size of a football field that is 10 times sharper than 
previous pictures of the planet 
stephen saunders magellan project scientist said the radar 
images could help scientists understand how venus was formed and 
might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how earth and 
venus evolved so differently even though they were almost identical 
when the solar system formed 46 billion years ago 
the magellan deployment is scheduled 6 hours 18 minutes after 
liftoff with astronauts mark lee and mary cleave conducting a 
countdown from inside their shuttle cabin an hour after the 
release a rocket is to fire to hurl the 7600pound unmanned probe 
on a 450day journey to venus a complex trip that takes magellan 
one and onehalf times around the sun before it intercepts its 
target planet 
the atlantis crew also includes commander david walker pilot 
ronald grabe and mission specialist norman thagard lee is the only 
one who has not flown on a previous shuttle mission 
spending cutbacks and delays forced by the 1986 challenger 
accident prompted nasa to use the roundabout approach to venus the 
trip could have been made in four months under better circumstances 
the first american planetary mission since 1978 will mark the 
beginning of a busy year for nasas planetary program in august 
the voyager spacecraft will fly by neptune and in october well 
launch galileo from the shuttle to jupiter gerpheide said 
at a briefing for reporters thursday nasas fisk vowed no 
one is going to question our leadership in planetary flight 
again 
the atlantis countdown began tuesday and was progressing so 
smoothly thursday that the launch team had time to relax during a 
15hour halt of the clock the time had been set aside for catchup 
work 
we just dont have anything out there that were worried 
about its been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue 
that way said countdown director ron phelps 
weather officers said they were keeping one eye on scattered 
clouds which were moving into the skies above moron spain where 
an airbase serves as an emergency landing site in the event of a 
problem after launch 
the astronauts were briefed throughout the day on the status of 
the countdown and reviewed their flight plans they were to retire 
early friday arising about 9 am to prepare for the afternoon 
launch only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after 
noon 
magellan is to orbit the cloudveiled planet and map up to 90 
percent of the surface during 243 earth days equal to one venusian 
day 
low resolution pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft hint at 
earthlike mountain ranges and rolling plains but the surface 
temperature on venus is 900 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 
90 times that of earths 
the last planetary mission launched by the united states was the 
1978 pioneervenus probe voyager 2 launched in 1977 will take 
the first closeup look at neptune in august after earlier exploring 
jupiter saturn and uranus 
other major science projects planned in the next three years are 
the launch of the hubble space telescope from a shuttle early next 
year the ulysses probe to study the sun in october 1990 and the 
mars observer spacecraft in 1992

to shave or not to shave for bearded 
politicians facing an election fight thats the question 
either way they say its risky business 
conservative rep robert k dornan rcalif sprouted flaming 
red chin whiskers last year but shaved them off for the november 
election he easily won a sixth house term 
but when liberal former rep mike lowry dwash shaved off his 
yasser arafat lookalike beard last fall in his bid for a 
senate seat he lost 
another gop conservative from california freshman rep dana 
rohrabacher ignored his media experts advice and refused to shave 
his beard the voters elected him anyway 
i got letters mostly from older people saying i like your 
ideas but you look like a tramp said rohrabacher who had 
written speeches for thenpresident reagan but i figure i gained 
much more support by keeping my beard it helped me stand out from 
the eight other primary candidates who all looked alike 
rohrabacher is one of only five remaining members of the house 
beard caucus an informal group that convened one morning this week 
in the house barber shop to celebrate their hairy individualism 
the groups sole purpose is to allow members to fraternize 
about the politics of having hair on your face said rep david 
e bonior dmich the caucus chairman 
the other members are reps mickey leland dtexas ron dellums 
dcalif and floyd flake dny the numbers are shrinking down 
from about a dozen last year there are no beards in the senate 
one of the caucus cleanshaven defectors rep gary ackerman 
dny is scornful of the wimps who shave before an election 
or wait until theyve won to grow a beard 
ackerman got rid of his 17yearold goatee only after the 
election he says proudly 
i just got tired of reading in the newspapers that i won by a 
whisker or had a close shave in the last election he said 
ackerman has no intention of growing a new beard i feel 
almost like a virgin as though ive captured my longlost youth 
he says but smoothchinned rep dennis eckart dohio says he 
will grow another 
shaving says eckart is my way of splurging my little way of 
rewarding myself after an election moreover ive discovered 
that the humidity of washington is the greatest inducement to 
shaving known to mankind he said 
eckart says shaving off a beard before an election campaign is 
hazardous 
many members now have to resort to an expensive media campaign 
that features them with one look he said as i discovered 
when folks get used to seeing you one way and then see you a few 
weeks later looking another way it draws instant criticism 
rep sam gejdenson dconn now cleanshaven says he grows a 
beard every time i take a couple of days off and always gets 
complaints from constituents 
ive gotten more nasty mail over my beard than over any other 
issue since ive been in congress he says nonetheless 
gejdenson plans to grow his back 
bonior who is chief deputy whip for house democrats says he 
shaved his beard briefly last christmas because his family hadnt 
seen him for 10 years without one 
they didnt like what they saw so i grew it back he said

israeli soldiers shot and 
killed three palestinians and wounded 74 others in widespread 
clashes thursday in the occupied west bank and gaza strip arab 
reports and hospital officials said 
the army reported only eight woundings and accused palestinians 
of inflating the figure to gain sympathy 
the gunshot wounds reported by palestinian hospitals brought to 
more than 225 the number reported injured in clashes with soldiers 
this week the army has confirmed only 22 
in the west bank more than 100 teenagers from jewish 
settlements hiked near the palestinian village of beita where an 
israeli girl was killed a year ago to symbolize their demand that 
the occupied lands be part of israel 
its our country we must walk here said 16yearold biti 
shaovitz from the settlement of karnei shomrom 
soldiers and armed settler leaders guarded the hikers under an 
agreement with the army they did not enter beita where 
15yearold terza porat was accidentally killed by a jewish 
bodyguard a year ago when a group of hikers got involved in a 
confrontation with stonethrowing arabs 
before thursdays hike soldiers raided the village to search 
for palestinian activists two youths were wounded by army gunfire 
a military spokesman said arab reports said five were wounded 
the armys deputy spokesman col renaan gissin said the 
reason you see a greater number of wounded is because of a 
deliberate attempt by palestinians to overload the list 
there is no dramatic increase in the number of wounded he 
said 
the wounded figures from hospitals include people who are 
treated for gunshot wounds then released the army says it does 
not include these since it cannot verify if they were shot by 
soldiers or fellow palestinians 
this makes it easy for the palestinians to inflate the 
figures said gissin 
he added the army also cannot confirm gunshot victims who go to 
private hospitals or clinics only those treated in government 
hospitals 
of the 74 reported treated in five arab hospitals on thursday 
the army confirmed 11 palestinians wounded eight from the west 
bank and three from gaza 
an official at the un relief and works agency which is 
responsible for palestinians refugees said he had reports of 30 
gunshot wounds by midafternoon in gaza and was still receiving 
reports he spoke on condition of anonymity 
of the 154 reported wounded earlier in the week the army 
confirmed 14 
the army reported that soldiers thursday ran into a violent 
protest in the askar refugee camp near the west bank town of nablus 
and opened fire killing one palestinian 
the victim imad muhammad harbieh 20 was shot in the chest 
hospital officials said 
in the gaza strip ali said gharableh 30 died of a gunshot 
wound to the chest in a clash with soldiers after moslem prayers at 
a mosque in gaza city hospital officials said 
also in gaza 15yearold ashraf samir ead was shot in the chest 
in a protest in the town of rafah and died en route to the 
hospital arab reporters said 
the army was checking the reports of the deaths in gaza 
thursdays deaths raised to 454 the number of arabs reported 
killed in the revolt which began in december 1988 eighteen 
israelis have died 
on thursday the plobacked leadership of the uprising issued a 
leaflet rejecting plans by prime minister yitzhak shamir to hold 
elections in the occupied lands the leaflet said the plan was 
attempt to divide the palestinians and circumvent the plo 
an aide to shamir said israel will not offer an alternative to 
shamirs election proposal despite the rejection of the plan 
on wednesday 83 prominent residents in the occupied lands 
rejected the idea calling the elections a ploy to end the uprising 
without giving the palestinians what they want an independent 
state 
this is the best program we can suggest to them said shamir 
spokesman yossi ahimeir 
shamirs plan calls for elections of local palestinians to 
negotiate an interim peace with israel to be followed by talks on 
the final status of the occupied lands 
shamir who has repeatedly rejected the palestinians demands 
for their own state and talks with the plo said on israel army 
radio we have heard an announcement from some of our neighbors 
that they reject our proposals i hope this is not their last 
word 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told israel radio if palestinians 
turn down the peace proposal israel must adopt a policy of a 
more intense action of putting down first of all the violence 
this he said will bring about between half a year to a 
year acceptance of the political way by elements in the arab world 
and first and foremost in the territories

passover the jewish holiday of exodus was a 
festival of return this year for a group of jews who lived in 
shanghai more than four decades ago 
it was symbolic of the return of a jewish presence to china 
said yosef tekoah israels former ambassador to the united 
nations said of the passover seder celebrated this year in chinas 
largest city 
tekoah as honorary chairman of the international assembly of 
jews in china last week led 25 shanghai jews or their descendants 
back to the city that offered thousands of jews refuge from 
persecution in the first half of this century 
the tour which included 50 others from the united states 
israel and other countries also provided new impetus to growing 
contacts between china and israel which have no diplomatic 
relations 
for most on the trip nostalgia took precedence over politics 
tekoah chancellor of ben gurion university of the negev recited 
the kaddish or prayer for the dead at the synagogue now a law 
college auditorium where he prayed with his parents as a boy 
sasson jacoby foreign editor of the jerusalem post returned to 
the house where he spent his childhood he also found his old 
synagogue now a shanghai government education bureau office 
nothing has changed they havent even repainted the 
interior he said the red guard the young leftists who 
destroyed houses of worship throughout china during the 196676 
cultural revolution apparently failed to discover the hebrew 
inscriptions now hidden behind a movie screen 
the group also found several former jewish cultural centers at 
one they ran into a chinese wedding in what is now a public hall 
most of it remains as we remember it tekoah said adding 
that while the homes in the old foreign quarters are run down 
todays shanghai is vibrant with activity gone are the downtrodden 
masses of beggars rickshaw drivers and the desperately poor 
the shanghai jewish community dates back at least to the 19th 
century when jacobys ancestors arrived from baghdad 
the iraqi jewish community numbering about 1000 included 
families such as the sassoons and kadoories who were to become rich 
in the china trade the sassoon family in 1921 helped build their 
synagogue and jacobys father was once the temples rabbi 
the next wave including tekoahs family were refugees from the 
bolshevik revolution many of the 8000 russian jews first stopped 
in harbin and other northeastern china cities 
the third and largest group was german and other central 
european jews escaping nazi persecution before and during world war 
ii from 20000 to 25000 eventually made their way to shanghai 
tekoah said 
china occupies a very special place tekoah said it is 
the only country in the entire world that didnt know what 
antisemitism is the chinese people by their nature are very 
tolerant and jewish people have benefited from that 
tekoah said that in his speech at the passover seder he spoke 
of parallels between two of the worlds oldest cultures both value 
scholarship and the family he said and both are very pragmatic in 
their approaches to life 
jewish traders are believed to have settled in china even before 
the beginning of the christian era but the first permanent jewish 
community was probably established in the 11th century in kaifeng 
in central china 
the kaifeng jews who may have arrived by way of india 
flourished until the 19th century when they assimilated with the 
chinese and their customs and rituals gradually disappeared 
during their shanghai visit the tour met with the shanghai 
judaic studies association a group of chinese scholars formed 
several months ago to study the heritage of judaism in kaifeng and 
other chinese cities 
they want to be in touch with jewish organizations in 
israel tekoah said he said the forming of such a group and the 
warm reception they received in shanghai were indications of 
increased contacts between israel and china long a firm supporter 
of arab causes 
as mao tsetung said a 1000mile journey begins with a 
single step 
the jewish community in shanghai dissolved in 1948 and 1949 with 
the communist takeover and the creation of the jewish state in 
israel but now tekoah said the links have been restored for 
each one of us this was a very moving return to our roots

oliver norths lawyers and a civil liberties 
group are joining 10 news organizations in seeking release of a 
sealed document described to norths trial jury by his principal 
lawyer 
the news organizations including the associated press are 
battling the justice department in the us court of appeals in an 
attempt to gain access to the stipulation which has been given to 
the jury 
the document summarizes intelligence intercepts concerning a 
ciaassisted arms shipment from israel to iran in the early stages 
of the iranconta affair 
the news organizations are seeking a speedy hearing on their 
request saying that norths lawyers were free to disclose the 
entire stipulation on the public record during final arguments in 
his criminal trial north lawyer brendan sullivan described what 
the document shows in open court on april 19 but the justice 
department says full disclosure would threaten national 
security 
the stipulation describes us government tracking of the 
november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
us district judge gerhard a gesell on saturday rejected the 
motion of the news organizations to gain access to the stipulation 
saying it is a classified document the organizations went to 
the appeals court monday 
the justice department now wants the matter sent back to 
district court to give the government an opportunity to spell out 
in secret to the judge why the press should be denied access 
alternatively the department wants 14 days to file a brief in the 
appeals court 
on thursday the news organizations opposed both government 
requests saying the case should remain in the appeals court and 
that briefs should be filed by next tuesday 
the american civil liberties union supports the news medias 
request for an expedited hearing on the request for public 
disclosure 
the government has made no attempt here to show any compelling 
interest for sealing an exhibit which has been shown to the jury 
and partially read in open court stated the motion by aclu 
lawyer kate martin 
norths lawyers say nondisclosure of an exhibit at a criminal 
trial is incompatible with the sixth amendment guarantee of a 
public trial and with the classified information procedures act 
cipa makes no provision for partial release of a trial exhibit to 
jurors but not to the public said norths lawyers 
court security officers deleted portions of sullivans courtroom 
comments on the intercepts from the official court transcript but 
gesell ruled that they must be restored 
one deleted passage said that employing certain 
intelligencegathering methods allowed north to know exactly what 
was going on in the iranian initiative and exactly what was 
happening with respect to the transfer of missiles to iran 
another deleted passage said the intercepts were delivered to 
highranking government officials including cia director william 
casey and deputy national security adviser john poindexter

the prices americans paid for imported goods 
rose 17 percent in the first quarter largely reflecting a surge 
in the cost of crude oil from abroad the government reported 
thursday 
the firstquarter price increase down slightly from a 2 percent 
pace in the final three months of 1988 would represent a 7 percent 
annual inflation rate if sustained for a full year the labor 
department said 
on the export side meanwhile prices for us goods sold 
overseas rose 14 percent in the last quarter after declining 03 
percent in the preceding three months the increase which 
reflected higher prices for exports of food fuels and crude 
materials would translate into a 57 percent annual inflation rate 
the quarterly figures are not adjusted to remove seasonal 
factors 
economist nigel gault of data resources inc in lexington 
mass said the price increases for both exports and imports were 
consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as a 
whole are getting close to full capacity in industrial 
production a condition that can create shortages and bottlenecks 
that drive up prices 
the january through march increase in import prices was 
primarily due to an 183 percent jump in prices for imported fuels 
the fuels increase was led by a 278 percent surge in prices for 
imported crude oil that followed a november production accord by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
despite the firstquarter increase in fuel costs average prices 
for imported fuels still were onethird below their 1985 levels 
excluding fuels import prices rose a modest 05 percent during 
the first quarter after climbing 24 percent in the previous 
quarter the advance in prices for nonenergy imports was held down 
in part by the appreciation of the us dollar during the period 
the labor department said 
the dollars value increased 32 percent last quarter after 
falling 49 percent in the preceding quarter according to a 
tradeweighted index used by the department the index now is 21 
percent higher than it was in march 1988 
on the export side prices for food sold abroad rose 25 percent 
last quarter after declining 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 
1988 the grain index which reflects prices for roughly onehalf 
of us food exports rose 59 percent in the first quarter after 
falling 6 percent in the final three months of 1988 
since march 1988 the grain index has risen 353 percent mainly 
due to last summers drought 
prices for crude material exports rose 49 percent last quarter 
prices for fuel exports advanced 29 percent 
for a year the federal reserve board has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and keep 
inflation in check 
but gault said it will take some time for the tightening of 
monetary policy in the us and in other industrialized countries 
to slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact on 
the inflation rate 
for the 12month period that ended in march import prices rose 
51 percent while export prices advanced 63 percent

it may not be hog heaven but a new home 
in the bucolic mountain town of ojai is a big improvement for grunt 
the pig who was facing the prospect of becoming bacon only a week 
ago 
the estimated 1000pound animal whose plight touched people 
across the country is to be sent to a ranch where it is hoped 
hell live high on the hog 
this place that was arranged through the fund for animals 
sounds like a perfect location with other animals there like 
donkeys geese all kinds of other animals said los angeles 
county animal control spokeswoman gail christensen on wednesday 
it sounds like a real good life to me 
but the wife of grunts new owner sounded a bit well 
disgruntled 
seems to be any animal in the country whos not wanted by 
somebody guess who gets it said rhonda osborn 
mrs osborns contractor husband ozzie was selected from more 
than 300 people across the nation who offered to give grunt a new 
place to wallow 
the porcine plight began when grunt was abandoned by his owners 
who moved from their home in affluent rolling hills estates they 
gave their gardener permission to butcher him but the 4foottall 
hog was rescued by animal control officials when his terrified 
squeals alerted neighbors 
meanwhile officials say grunt seems to be reveling in all the 
attention 
he seems to be happy about it said animal control officer 
leslie mitchell in fact he seems to be a big ham about it

star wars scientists conducted a 20second 
laboratory flight test of a prototype weapon designed to maneuver 
in space to destroy enemy boosters early in flight pentagon 
officials announced thursday 
the test of a space based interceptor prototype last monday in 
a laboratory at edwards air force base in california was billed as 
a breakthrough by the pentagon it followed a test flight of the 
vehicle last nov 18 lasting two seconds 
the last test proved that the baby could stand up this one 
proves that it can walk said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
scientists from the strategic defense initiative organization 
said that the technology could be used on the brilliant pebbles 
interceptor that defense secretary dick cheney told congress 
tuesday would be a main focus of star wars research 
that was the first time that a space weapon has flown we 
integrated the propulsion and guidance units into a configuration 
and flew it for the first time said alan weston a scientist 
involved in the test 
pentagon officials showed reporters color film of the device 
powered by small rocket engines rising 30 feet in the air using 
small rocket engines to maneuver within a protective net then 
settling back down engineers could be heard cheering wildly inside 
the laboratory 
the reusable device cost 3 million to build is six feet long 
and weighs 154 pounds when loaded with 20 pounds of propellant 
said weston the test itself cost 500000 he said 
it did not move forward and did not include sensing devices to 
track enemy boosters 
the technology advances here are in extreme light weight and 
fast response said weston the rockets aboard the device fired 
in 450millisecond bursts with 350 pounds of thrust according to 
the pentagon a millisecond is one thousandth part of a second 
the brilliant pebbles plan discussed by cheney this week 
envisions thousands of orbiting satellites each about three feet 
long and weighing less than 100 pounds equipped with sensors to 
spot track and target satellites 
each pebble would also have rockets to drive it toward an 
enemy booster at speeds capable of destroying it without using 
explosive warheads 
the technology exists to reduce the weight of the vehicle tested 
monday to 10 pounds said lloyd stoessell another sdio official at 
the briefing 
the test also was intended to show the ability of computers 
aboard the device programmed in advance to give orders to 
maneuvering rockets that pointed the vehicle with a precision 
oneeighth of a degree an accuracy that would be necessary to 
steer the weapon toward an enemy rocket 
this is something that had never been done before said 
weston 
scientists plan another test of the prototype this june when it 
will be equipped with a infrared tracker pointed at a rocket engine 
parked and firing in a parking lot outside the laboratory said 
weston 
the prototype space vehicle would not leave the inside of the 
laboratory and therefore would not break the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty which restricts tests of spacebased antimissile 
systems 
cuts in the star wars budget have delayed for several years any 
space tests of the technology demonstrated on monday said 
stoessell 
the bush administration this week proposed cutting star wars 
spending to 46 billion in fiscal 1990 down from the 59 billion 
proposed by president reagan in his last budget recommendation

west german leaders on thursday 
criticized washingtons rejection of superpower talks on 
shortrange nuclear weapons and urged nato to show more readiness 
to deal with the soviet bloc 
there is much to fear in this world but we certainly dont 
have to fear negotiations or a soviet union that is ready to 
talk foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told parliament 
winning cheers and applause from opposition as well as government 
party lawmakers 
his remarks followed a major policy speech in parliament by 
chancellor helmut kohl 
kohl also stepped up pressure on the united states to agree to 
negotiations with the soviets on reducing shortrange nuclear 
rockets and artillery 
because of the range of the shortrange systems the federal 
republic of germany is affected more by these weapons than the 
other partners in the nato alliance kohl said 
kohl also has called on the north atlantic treaty organization 
to delay a decision on modernizing aging shortrange lance nuclear 
missiles until after federal elections next year polls indicate 
most west germans oppose nato plans to increase the range of the 
lance missiles 
the nato nations are in disarray over kohls proposal for 
superpower negotiations on shortrange weapons 
washington has given kohl a clear rebuff fearing negotiations 
could lead to elimination of the shortrange weapons and increase 
the threat to western europe from superior warsaw pact conventional 
forces 
britain also rejects kohls proposal 
but nato allies belgium norway and denmark have indicated their 
support for kohl another nato partner italy on thursday 
announced it was siding with kohl 
the western alliance hopes to reach a common position on the 
issue before the may 2930 nato summit in brussels but there have 
been no signs the stalemate can be broken before then 
genscher delivered a ringing address indirectly targeting the 
united states and britain 
those who want disarmament must take up negotiations he 
said 
us officials have said nato should keep a cautious eye on 
reform movements in the soviet union and other soviet bloc nations 
because there is no certainty their results including promises of 
unilateral disarmament measures will be permanent 
but genscher urged the west to be far more receptive of positive 
soviet bloc developments 
this is a historic opportunity we cannot let it pass us by 
and wait passively that is our responsibility genscher said 
kohl echoed genschers call for an increased western dialogue 
with the soviet bloc 
we should support the reform processes in all warsaw pact 
countries kohl said urging our european and american friends 
to help carry out this policy and agree on a common course 
recent polls indicate that threequarters of the west german 
population favors eliminating nuclear weapons in europe most of 
natos shortrange weapons are based in west germany 
kohl reassured the united states and other alliance partners 
that his government does not want to eliminate those arms 
in the current circumstances land sea and airborne 
shortrange nuclear weapons are still important in europe kohl 
said

a consumer group on thursday urged tighter 
government regulation of the multimilliondollar lawn care 
industry saying there are few state laws to ensure workers are 
properly trained or warned of potential health effects of the 
chemicals used 
public citizen a private environmental and consumer 
organization said a national survey shows that nearly twothirds 
of the states have no requirement for either training or testing 
lawn care employees 
the survey said only about a third of the states require that 
consumers be given information about the chemicals used and in most 
of those states a company supplies little more than a chemical 
label only a handful of states require notice before a lawn is 
treated or a warning that it has been treated according to the 
survey 
as a result millions of americans may be unwittingly exposed 
to potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards said 
laura weiss who wrote public citizens report on the survey 
the lawn care industry has grown rapidly in recent years with 
more than 7 million households using such sevices annually in 1987 
the industry had revenues of 15 billion according to public 
citizen 
ms weiss also wrote a recent report maintaining that many of 
the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have the potential of 
causing longterm health problems including cancer birth defects 
liver kidney or nerve damage as well as shortterm ailments 
the industry has defended its use of the chemicals saying the 
companies only use them in accordance with safety instructions 
supplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approved 
by the environmental protection agency for lawn care use 
we have to be registered and certified in most states said 
james brooks a spokesman for the professional lawn care 
association 
but ms weiss says in her report that while the epa approves the 
use of chemicals for lawn care there is little federal regulation 
of lawn care companies and no federal training or performance 
standards for workers who actually treat the lawns 
here are some of the findings according to the public citizen 
survey 
only six states require both that advance notice be given of 
scheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward those 
states are maryland massachusetts connecticut new jersey new 
york and rhode island 
maine and iowa require the warning signs but no advance notice 
while new hampshire and pennsylvania require the advance notice but 
no posttreatment warning signs 
a dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass a 
state test those states are arizona connecticut illinois 
indiana iowa kentucky massachusetts minnesota new mexico 
tennessee utah and wisconsin but only in indiana and utah are 
lawn care employees required to be both trained and tested under 
statesupervised programs 
in most states consumers also are left without detailed 
explanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn care 
chemicals said ms weiss 
only massachusetts new york and maryland require state 
information sheets to be provided to customers seventeen other 
states have some form of consumer information requirement but in 
many cases that amounts to merely providing the names of the 
pesticides being used the report said

press reports from alaska have failed to get 
across the vast killing of wildlife or the enormous remaining risks 
to millions of birds animals and fish from the oil spill in prince 
william sound a conservation group said thursday 
we may already be seeing only one percent of the dead said 
albert m manville senior staff wildlife biologist for defenders 
of wildlife 
manville who spent april 1217 observing cleanup efforts and 
damage from the march 24 spill said reports of 200 to 300 miles of 
beach contaminated by the 11million gallon spill were wildly 
inaccurate 
actual beach contamination he said is probably closer to 
1000 to 2000 miles of coastline and islands southwest of the 
sound 
aerial spotting may report many beaches clean when an 
ontheground inspection would show they are not manville said he 
said he was unable to say how much uncontaminated coastline remains 
at risk 
the war on stopping the oil spill is lost in my opinion but 
a few skirmishes can still be won he said the unfortunate 
fact of the matter is that ongoing wildlife rehabilitation is 
probably more for the publics benefit than for the wildlifes 
his organization was joined by several other environmental 
groups in writing the tanker owner exxon corp the coast guard 
and other cleanup authorities asking greater attention to wildlife 
the letter from defenders greenpeace the sierra club legal 
defense fund the national audubon society and trustees for alaska 
called for immediate installation of protective booms and 
stationing of skimming equipment at port nellie juan and port wells 
in western prince william sound and port chalmers and stockdale 
harbor on the northwest coast of montague island and development 
of a plan developed to protect orca inlet if necessary 
millions of waterfowl migrate through the sound area every year 
and 300000 to 500000 birds make the sound their home for at least 
part of the year manville said 
birds on their northward migration probably would not land on 
oil or oilsoaked areas in good weather but if the weather is bad 
they might and we could have the catastrophic loss of millions of 
birds manville said 
oil has been spotted 325 miles from the spot where the tanker 
exxon valdez ran aground manville said this was a somewhat 
greater distance than the 275 miles mentioned in the latest 
confirmed reports from alaska 
accurate counts of dead wildlife have been difficult manville 
said because of scavenging by eagles and gulls which may die 
after eating oilsoaked carcasses deaths include up to 300 sitka 
blacktailed deer at least one bear and muskrat and porcupine 
probably threequarters of the 5500 sea otters living in the 
western half of the sound the half hit by the spreading oil have 
been killed or harmed by the oil he said the fish and wildlife 
service estimated on april 14 that nearly all the otters in the oil 
impact area had been killed 
as of wednesday 391 dead otters had been counted either in the 
wild or after unsuccessful rescue attempts 
defenders recommended the transfer of additional 
supersucker oil scooping ships from the oilexploration areas 
off alaskas north slope a visit to the sound by president bush 
trials of a new detergent bioversal offered by a west german 
company for beach cleaning payments by exxon of 1 billion a year 
for five years for restoration conversion of key areas of the 
arctic national wildlife refuge on the north slope to a wilderness 
area to prevent drilling there and refunding the money for some 95 
million worth of drilling leases not yet awarded in bristol bay

pravda on thursday published seven pages of 
astonishing admissions by communist party officials that their 
failures had led to embarrassing losses in parliamentary elections 
and damaged the peoples faith in their leaders 
the officials speaking at a meeting of the partys 
policymaking central committee said the 20 millionmember party 
is in danger of losing its unity and hold on the soviet people 
the people feel uncomfortable alarmed have lost their 
optimism said moscow mayor valery t saikin who lost in the 
march 26 elections various generations of people separate 
social layers and even regions are quarrelling among themselves 
his remarks and those of president mikhail s gorbachev and 19 
other speakers dominated pravda the partys official newspaper 
saikin said people were losing faith in the party and that as a 
result party organizations have lost their vanguard role this 
was a striking admission that the party had failed in one of its 
primary goals to lead soviet society 
remarks at central committees generally are kept secret and 
publication of 20 critical speeches delivered tuesday appeared to 
be an effort to show the people the leadership is hearing their 
complaints 
admissions that perestroika gorbachevs 4yearold 
restructuring program has failed to solve many of the countrys 
problems also could serve as ammunition by people fighting for more 
radical reform 
gorbachev gained strength to push for more extreme action at 
tuesdays meeting when 74 of the central committees 301 members 
retired 
because of age illness or political disgrace those who retired 
had lost the top government or party job which entitled them to 
membership the remarks of some of those who retired were published 
thursday 
among them was geidar a aliev the 65yearold former party 
chief in azerbaijan and a close associate of former president 
leonid i brezhnev 
news reports have accused aliev of corruption and falsifying 
records to show he was a war veteran but aliev told the central 
committee the accusations were untrue and came from people he had 
fired in azerbaijan for wrongdoing 
yuri f solovyev the highest ranking of the approximately three 
dozen party officials who lost in the elections to the congress of 
peoples deputies said that despite perestroika the minuses 
here still significantly exceed the pluses 
because of the failures said ivan k polozkov a party leader 
in the krasnodar region of southern russia the authority of the 
party is falling in the eyes of the public 
many members feel no need to adhere to the party program and 
rules and some are so despondent over the lack of recognition of 
their accomplishments that they have turned in their party 
membership cards he said 
several other speakers painted similarly bleak pictures 
today people do not have confidence in tomorrow said 
vladimir i melnikov the party chief of the komi region 
we are losing the workers he said the country is in a 
real crisis that gorbachev is not fully aware of because the 
central committee staff is safeguarding the general secretary 
from the severity of the situation 
melnikov told the committee many party officials are so afraid 
of the peoples wrath that they are refusing to run in the next 
round of elections to the 2250seat parliament on may 14 
in closing remarks at the committee meeting tuesday gorbachev 
agreed perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of 
housing consumer goods and food but said people still have faith 
in the party 
i do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearly 
losing its position in the country or that it has turned into a 
debating society and so on gorbachev said 
the partys dialogue with working people is not a weakness or 
making the communist party a debating society if it is weakness to 
conduct a dialogue with all segments of society then i do not know 
what courage is

the juvenile justice system was created to 
deal with the children of folks like us and should be toughened 
to punish the kinds of kids who did what happened in central 
park a new hampshire congressman declared thursday 
what were saying is if youre going to do bigboy crime 
youre going to do bigboy time said rep chuck douglas rnh 
a former state supreme court justice 
douglas spoke at a news conference called by four congressional 
freshmen members of the republican research committee task force 
on crime to say the beating and rape of a woman in new yorks 
central park on april 19 highlights a need for changing the 
juvenile justice system 
i can tell you that we have a juvenile justice system that is 
modeled basically for the middle class douglas said the 
children of folks like us the children of the middle class who may 
get into trouble with shoplifting at a young age they may throw a 
rock through a window thats where the juvenile justice system 
works but the system does not work and its no deterrent and 
its no protection and shouldnt be for the kinds of kids who did 
what happened in central park 
asked to explain his folks like us comment douglas said 
the kinds of people who are in this room people who are not 
involved in the drug scene people who are not making their living 
selling crack thats what i meant by the kinds of folks who are in 
this room 
eight people ages 14 to 17 are in custody 
only one has a police record and in general teachers called 
them good students one principal said of two of them they come 
from homes of parents who care parents who are as shocked as we 
are four lived in a building with a doorman 
the congressmen said that in many states youngsters who commit 
violent crimes such as rape armed robbery murder or attempted 
murder get little more than a slap on the wrist 
the task force is hoping by the end of the year to create 
standardized state legislation that would cause the most violent 
of juvenile offenders to receive the full punishment for their 
actions if theyre convicted said rep steven schiff rnm a 
former district attorney the task force would strongly urge states 
to pass its model legislation he said 
douglas said he hoped congress would pass his own bill to 
withhold federal money for juvenile justice from states that fail 
to adopt such model legislation 
the other two members of the group at the news conference were 
reps dennis smith of oregon and melton d hancock of missouri

a mentally disabled aidsinfected 7yearold 
who won a long legal battle for admission to public school attended 
class for the first time thursday amid cheers from supporters and 
hugs from classmates 
eliana martinez wearing a pink dress and matching bows in her 
hair received a warm welcome at the manhattan exceptional center 
where supporters cheered outside the singlestory redbrick 
building 
administrators pushed for a smooth transition inside and fellow 
students wasted no time getting acquainted with their new classmate 
she rushed in the children came around her and one of them 
hugged her said rosa martinez who fought officials fears that 
her incontinent daughter posed a health risk to others through 
bodily secretions they just surrounded her she added they 
didnt need any introduction 
a federal judge ruled wednesday that the child could attend 
school without being confined to a glass isolation booth paving 
the way for what mrs martinez called the most important day of 
elianas life 
principal sandra williams said she sent notes to parents 
wednesday to prepare them for the girls arrival and received seven 
calls of concern with one mother saying she was not ready to 
accept the risk 
a meeting aimed at reducing anxiety among parents is scheduled 
for next week said walter sickles deputy superintendent of 
hillsborough county schools 
eliana carried a knapsack and a toy that plays the disney song 
its a small world as she entered school to become the 12th 
student in her class 
its a wonderful day for her attorney steve hanlon said 
shell do wonderfully here shes going to take off like a 
rocket 
mrs martinez said she was glad the 2year legal battle was 
finally behind her im too happy to be bitter about anything 
she said 
linda castellano a family friend and head of an aids support 
group called linda and frenz was among seven supporters outside 
the school where 201 pupils are enrolled 
i know shell benefit from playing with other kids she 
said shes always around adults and always having to look up 
now shell have eye contact with children 
us district judge elizabeth a kovachevich who originally 
ordered the glass booth for eliana ruled wednesday that the girl 
posed no significant health risk to her classmates 
her initial decision would have confined the child to the booth 
until she became toilet trained and learned to stop sucking her 
fingers mrs martinez said she would not put her child in a 
glass cage 
the latest decision came four months after the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals sent the case back to ms kovachevich saying 
eliana who had been taught at home since june 1987 must be placed 
in a regular classroom unless there was evidence she posed a threat 
to other children through bodily secretions 
school officials generally said they were relieved that the 
lengthy battle is finished one however indicated he was still 
concerned about safety and said if he had a child in elianas class 
he probably would not let the child stay at the school 
based on the knowledge i do have right now i could not allow 
my child to be in the class school board chairman sam rampello 
said a judges decision doesnt take away the trepidation 
mrs martinez adopted eliana as an infant in her native puerto 
rico the girl became infected with aids from tranfusions of 
tainted blood shortly after her premature birth

us secretary of transportation samuel skinner 
said thursday he will no longer inform congress about airline 
security threats because he fears public disclosure could hamper 
security measures 
skinner also told reporters that passengers on us airlines may 
be barred from taking electronic devices on jets the bomb that 
blew up pan am flight 103 in december was hidden inside a 
radiocasette player 
later british transport secretary paul channon announced that 
britain will install a new us bombdetection device thermal 
neutron analysis at londons gatwick airport this summer the 
device can find plastic explosives that standard xrays miss 
britain will be the first foreign country to use the 1 million 
device skinner said it should be installed throughout europe 
following the dec 21 pan am explosion 
the jumbo jet bound for new york from frankfurt and london was 
blown apart by a tiny bomb over the scottish village of lockerbie 
killing 270 people 
skinner on the last stop of a fivenation european tour said 
he was adamant about not discussing publicly intelligencegathering 
or unannounced airline security bulletins 
i have just sent a letter to the us congress advising them 
that i will no longer disseminate information to them regarding 
security bulletins until i am absolutely sure that they have a 
mechanism in place to protect that information he said 
he said he plans new regulations about leaking airline 
securitytype information adding i may seek legislation 
making it a crime 
last month skinner criticized a london newspaper the daily 
express which reported a security bulletin that the us federal 
aviation administration sent to airports and carriers march 16 
about a possible hijacking of a us airliner in europe 
skinner thinks disclosure of warnings would prejudice security 
and that public notification of the many threats would result in 
them being taken for granted 
after the pan am explosion channon was accused of bungling the 
dissemination to airlines of west german warnings that palestinian 
terrorists had devised a new radiocassette bomb 
the first of the thermal neutron analysis devices will be 
installed at john f kennedy airport in july 
after the pan am disaster the united states accelerated by six 
months a 60 million thermal neutron analysis program 
skinner said he expected the devices to be installed at several 
european airports by years end 
every place i have gone everyone wants to do more said 
skinner who arrived thursday night after meeting government 
officials in italy west germany france and switzerland 
on electronic devices such as portable computers skinner said 
that unless a sure means of scanning them is devised they might be 
barred from aircraft but he added that a ban was unlikely

while the jury continued deciding his fate 
thursday oliver north turned his attention to a speech to an 
invitationonly audience in ohio 
north the former national security council aide being tried on 
12 criminal charges stemming from the irancontra affair has made 
several speeches since the trial began on jan 31 at fees believed 
to be 2000025000 each 
asked how much north was getting for thursday nights speech at 
the bankers club in cincinnati club manager brian lasure said 
thats confidential 
the legal bills of north who has had at least three lawyers at 
the defense table and at times as many as five are estimated at 
380000 a month 
reporters in cincinnati were told there would be no press 
coverage of norths speech in dubois tower the bankers clubs 
1200 members principally are bankers lawyers and businessmen and 
women 
the three men and nine women on norths jury meanwhile 
deliberated for the sixth day without any hint of where they stand 
they sent no notes out of the room and made no requests of the 
judge 
they quit for the day shortly after 4 pm having worked on 
their verdict for 5 hours a total 32 in the six days 
all 363 exhibits totaling some 1300 pages are in the second 
floor courtroom where the jurors are meeting so there is no need 
for them to ask for specific documents 
meanwhile 10 news organizations including the associated 
press are appealing us district judge gerhard a gesells ruling 
that they cannot see a north trial stipulation summarizing 
intelligence intercepts concerning a ciaassisted arms shipment to 
iran 
norths lawyers and the american civil liberties union are 
lining up on the side of the press which is trying have the 
document available to the jury released to the public as well 
north attorney brendan sullivan read aloud part of the document 
during his final summation in open court last week 
court security officers deleted some of sullivans words from 
the official transcript but gesell ordered them restored after the 
motion by the news media but he also declared the stipulation 
itself to be classified and that is the basis of the appeal 
the stipulation referred to intelligence intercepts that 
tracked minutebyminute the ciaassisted shipments of us 
hawk missiles sent from israel to iran in november 1985 norths 
lawyers used it in an effort to show the shipment was known at the 
top levels of the government 
sullivan told the jury to remember ollie north is charged 
with somehow doing a chronology and leaving out the november 1985 
missile transaction and somehow fooling casey and poindexter even 
though they got all this material which shows exactly what it 
was the reference was to the late cia director william casey and 
thennational security adviser john m poindexter 
later in the censoredthenuncensored transcript sullivan 
called the intelligence intercepts the most guarded most closely 
held intelligence in the united states government they remain 
classified top secret code level even today 
gesells office said all of the jurors were bearing up well 
apparently having overcome earlier health problems 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the nicaraguan contras and lying to the attorney 
general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the contras from 
the iran arms sales he also faces charges alleging he personally 
profited from the affair 
also thursday the chief judge of the fairfax county circuit 
court said he had renewed norths permit to carry a concealed 
weapon in the county where north lives 
its very unusual said chief judge lewis griffith adding 
that of 77 applications filed in 1988 north was the sole recipient 
of a permit 
north feels threatened by terrorists and what his attorney calls 
the nut element griffith said 
one of the charges against north is that he accepted an illegal 
gratuity a 13800 home security system which he says he needed 
because of terrorists threats

on one side of prince william sound 
wildlife agents set up scarecrows and fireworks thursday to scare 
migratory birds from landing on oily beaches 
a different kind of fireworks was being planned on the other 
side of the sound where residents of cordova prepared for a town 
meeting thursday night with officials of exxon the coast guard and 
others involved in cleaning the nations worst oil spill 
the mood here is people are really concerned said nancy 
bird a resident who has started a weekly newsletter on the oil 
spill and its effect on the small fishing community of about 2500 
people about 50 miles southeast of valdez 
bird said some of the concerns likely to be expressed at the 
meeting were 
cannery workers want to know why theyre being asked to release 
exxon of liability for canceling the herring season in order to get 
claims checks 
businesses want to know why they arent being reimbursed for 
their loss of business 
fishermen are concerned that the exxon valdez still is leaking 
and want it moved from one side of naked island to the other so 
crude wont flow directly toward hatcheries 
last time we talked with exxon everyone was very frustrated 
bird said the frustration level is still pretty high but its 
kind of matured we dont expect things to change very fast 
theyre so disorganized 
heavy fog canceled spotter flights thursday and kept skimmers in 
port 
wildlife agents arrived wednesday on green island and were 
setting up propane cannons scarecrows and other devices to scare 
migratory birds away 
the plywood scarecrows also will eventually be erected on seal 
island another favorite stopover for seabirds headed north 
officials said 
we went to the salvation army store in anchorage and bought 36 
sets of clothes to outfit the scarecrows said david mcgillivary 
a us fish amp wildlife biologist in valdez the lifesized 
scarecrows with painted faces were made with only halflength arms 
so that shirt sleeves flap in the wind 
exxon scientist al maki said wednesday the hazing program 
financed by the company is a contingency plan 
we could have that oil up before the majority of the birds 
arrive he said exxon officials said cleanup of the islands 
would begin within days 
the fish amp wildlife service said some migratory birds have 
arrived but most of the tens of thousands that pass through the 
area wont do so until early may 
an official of the national audubon society said he doubts the 
usefulness of the program but doesnt fault the fish amp wildlife 
service for preparing it 
its something that we support reluctantly said david 
cline the societys vice president for alaska 
the scare tactics are unlikely to have an impact because they 
will be conducted in a very small part of the vast sound and 
because the birds heading off to breeding grounds are genetically 
and physically programmed to go certain places cline said 
its extremely difficult to deter them 
a fish amp wildlife service spokesman at the agencys regional 
office in anchorage defended the hazing program 
basically the methods they will be using have been used 
extensively in the lower 48 spokesman craig rieben said 
more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled when a tanker ran 
aground on bligh reef on march 24 exxon and the state dispute the 
amount of the spill with the oil company setting the figure at 
101 million gallons and the state at 109 million

to no ones surprise president bush moved 
quickly to fulfill his campaign promise of strong efforts against 
the illegal drug trade but to almost everyones surprise he also 
suspended imports of assault rifles and talked of possible federal 
controls 
drugs and guns have highlighted the domestic policies of the 
first 100 days of the bush administration including an emergency 
plan to combat drugrelated murders in the district of columbia 
which became the nations murder capital in 1988 
a leftover problem and a sudden crisis put the spotlight on 
other domestic areas in the 100 days that ends saturday as the 
republican leader moved carefully in many other policy matters 
bush sent a major proposal to capitol hill to deal with the 
savings and loan crisis left from the reagan years congress is 
grinding away on the bailout bill estimated to cost 157 billion 
over 10 years 
and then the exxon valdez ran aground pouring oil from the 
giant tanker into the sea and polluting the alaska shoreline the 
administration came in for criticism for not moving fast enough to 
try to halt the environmental damage bush eventually dispatched 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and other top us 
officials to deal with the cleanup 
but the president made clear from inauguration day that dealing 
with the drug problem was at the top of his agenda 
this scourge will stop bush declared adding that it was 
the most obvious area in which we as a society must rise up 
united and express our intolerance 
the president named william j bennett the nations drug czar 
charged with the task of coordinating the fight 
but almost immediately bushs fight against drugs raised another 
tough issue gun control 
semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles were becoming increasingly 
popular with warring drug dealers around the country but public 
demands for controls on the weapons didnt take off until january 
when innocent children became the victims of a man who opened fire 
with such a rifle on a school yard in stockton calif five 
children were killed 
bush a lifelong member of the national rifle association vowed 
for the first six weeks in office that he opposed any ban on the 
rapidfire assaultstyle rifles 
he maintained that stance even though his wife barbara told 
the associated press just two weeks after her husbands 
inauguration that she fears guns and thinks assault weapons should 
be banned 
faced with a growing public outcry against the weapons bush 
relented a bit 
less than a month later the president asked bennett to look 
into the situation and revealed at a news conference that he had 
told bennett if you come to me with a sensible answer that takes 
care of the concerns that ive felt over the years ill take a 
hard look at it and ill work with you to that end 
the initial suspension on imports of semiautomatic weapons 
announced march 14 came only a few days after bennett was sworn in 
as director of the office of national drug control policy and the 
announcement came out of bennetts office 
bush dismissed speculation that the white house had directed 
that bennetts office handle the announcement to place some 
distance between the suspension and bush when the administration 
expanded the suspension a month later to include 24 models of 
weapons that had been left out of the original ban the 
announcement came out of the white house 
the president is a lifelong member of the national rifle 
association which was clearly not thrilled by the wayward path of 
its most wellknown member but the powerful lobby kept its powder 
dry when the first suspension of imports took effect saying the 
action would cool off the public outcries over the weapons 
triggered by the schoolyard shootings jan 17 by patrick purdy a 
24yearold drifter in stockton calif 
the nra denied allegations by an administration source that it 
had delivered messages through third parties to bennett threatening 
his political future because of his stand on the weapons 
irwin kahn a republican national committeeman and machine gun 
dealer who also owns a 23 million office furniture company in 
ohio said bush had no other option but to suspend the imports 
i think its the only thing he could have done what he did 
was defused temporarily a situation that is being totally 
overreacted to kahn said in a telephone interview 
as for the drugrelated violence in the district of columbia 
bennett outlined an emergency plan april 10 to combat the problem 
in doing so he blasted mayor marion barry jrs handling of the 
issue which brought a comment from white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater that we are in this to solve the drug problem not to 
pick fights 
the administration had hoped to have a comprehensive drug crime 
and gun package ready to announce during bushs fourday trip this 
week but it did not materialize white house chief of staff john 
sununu said the package is a week to 10 days away 
the presidents budget proposal for fiscal 1990 starting oct 
1 reflected his interest in the drug war by requesting 55 
billion to fight the battle almost a 1 billion increase over 
spending this year and about 236 million more than president 
reagan had sought for 1990

police are arresting nonindian protesters 
at a record pace at lakes where the chippewa indians are spearing 
fish under the guarantee of 19thcentury treaties state officials 
said thursday 
an organizer of a sitin protest at which 35 people were 
arrested wednesday night said more opponents of the chippewas 
courtaffirmed treaty rights are willing to go to jail and similar 
protests may be staged 
the arrests were made when crowds gathered at boat landings on 
northern wisconsin lakes where the annual chippewa spearing season 
began last weekend prior to the fishing season for nonindians 
dean crist a spokesman for stop treaty abusewisconsin and one 
of those arrested criticized oneida county sheriff charles crofoot 
for roping off boat landings where the chippewa were spearing thus 
restricting protesters from the lakes 
if sheriff crofoot doesnt come around we might try it a 
protest with 300 people crist said what we would like is 
equal access to the landings were not trying to test the jails 
this is the fifth spring that wisconsins six chippewa bands 
have speared fish since a federal court ruled in 1983 that the 
tribe retained the right to gather food offreservation the right 
was guaranteed under 19thcentury treaties that ceded much of 
northern wisconsin to the united states 
spearfishing critics say the threepronged spears used by the 
indians leave too few trophysize walleyed pike for nonindian 
anglers when the rodandreel season begins in early may 
tom maulson a member of the lac du flambeau chippewa who helps 
organize the tribes spearfishing activities said police were 
doing a fantastic job protecting the indian spearers 
but tensions between the chippewa and nonindians were at an 
alltime high he added 
i dont think it can get any worse than this he said all 
we can do is hope 
twentysix of those arrested were charged thursday in oneida 
county circuit court with violating a county disorderly conduct 
ordinance and released on signature bonds district attorney brian 
maloney said 
nine others were released from jail after posting bond and will 
be charged at a later date he said 
in all 43 protesters were arrested at three lakes wednesday 
night raising the total number of arrests to 46 since the chippewa 
began their spearfishing season sunday night 
in madison ralph christensen chief warden for the state 
department of natural resources said thursday it was clearly the 
case that police would arrest a record number of protesters this 
season 
christensen said wednesdays protests marked the first organized 
civil disobedience involving treaty rights opponents 
george meyer dnr chief of enforcement said crowds of 
protesters at boat landings this year have been more emotional 
and larger than at this time in other years 
the wisconsin natural resource board on thursday approved an 
emergency rule that authorizes the state to sharply reduce bag 
limits for nonindian anglers who fish lakes that are also speared 
by the chippewa 
under the rule the state will reduce the number of walleye 
taken daily by anglers from five to three or less on the 254 lakes 
that the chippewa plan to spear this spring

an investigation into a federal housing 
renovation program has revealed a pattern in which former reagan 
administration officials raked in handsome profits on contracts to 
rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor 
the inspector general of the department of housing and urban 
development drew a comparison with the pentagon procurement 
scandal with former government officials drawing big fees as 
consultants to developers seeking government contracts 
but inspector general paul adams said he had found no evidence 
that active hud officials had been involved in influencepeddling 
and made no charges of criminal activity 
the investigation by the departments inspector general 
announced wednesday also listed several former toplevel hud 
officials who later won contracts as developers of rehabilitation 
projects 
the consultants who charged fees up to 13 million included 
president reagans first interior secretary james watt the late 
john mitchell attorney general under president nixon former 
republican sen ed brooke of massachusetts and former kentucky 
gov louis nunn also a republican 
adams in an interview thursday said that while he had found no 
illegality or criminal activity in the investigation into huds 
moderate rehabilitation program contracts had been distributed in 
ways that suggested favoritism and insider information was used to 
direct hud awards for projects 
money for over half the units audited went to just 10 states 
who by hud formula were fairly entitled only 16 percent 
adams said he had turned over the 700page investigative report 
to the justice departments public integrity branch for review 
the rehab program is a 225 million a year endeavor that has 
survived in congress despite efforts by the reagan administration 
to kill it through it developers win contracts to acquire and 
renovate existing housing and receive hud guarantees of subsidized 
rents for 15 years 
adams said in a memo to hud secretary jack kemp that developers 
and local public housing agencies were led to believe the 
consultants enjoyed a special relationship with persons making 
recommendations and decisions 
interviews with housing officials suggested favoritism in the 
program was widely suspected 
this is not news to me it was suspected said gordon 
cavanaugh attorney for the council of large public housing 
authorities 
one hud official speaking only on the condition of anonymity 
said this was the road to the gravy train you come in here and 
work a few years and then get out and make millions in modrehab 
addressing the pentagon purchasing scandal adams said in his 
memo 
in defense the contractors were paying consultants to obtain 
information to influence contract awards at hud the developers 
were paying consultants to influence awards of moderate 
rehabilitation units to public housing authorities 
the difference between the two situations is that the 
investigation at defense was able to prove that the consultants 
paid government employees for information and for selecting a 
particular contractor our investigation at hud was unable to 
substantiate that government employees received any financial 
consideration from the consultants 
adams report questioned the role of thomas t demery the 
former assistant secretary and federal housing commissioner who 
was responsible for the programs beginning in 1986 the 
investigation looked into contracts going back to 1984 
investigators found that a nonprofit charity food for africa 
which demery headed before joining hud received 290000 from 
recipients of hud contracts under the program efforts to locate 
demery were unsuccessful thursday 
kemp expressing shock at the fundamental flaws and 
mismanagement revealed by the investigation ordered a halt to 35 
pending awards worth 100 million his aide mary brunette said 
thursday eight contracts already executed in the current fiscal 
year will be allowed to continue but will be audited as will 
nearly 300 existing contracts 
investigators found nearly 59 million in excess subsidies paid 
by hud and said if the pattern existed throughout the program the 
figure would reach 413 million 
on capitol hill the house banking chairman rep henry b 
gonzales dtexas said the report showed the program was misused 
to feather the financial nest of hud and reagan administration 
favorites 
he praised kemps actions announced intentions to hold hearings 
on the investigation and said he would ask the office of government 
ethics to examine the reports on former hud officials 
adams report named 11 former hud officials who participated in 
project contracts as developers and owners consultants or 
representatives of lenders 
among them was former under secretary philip abrams and former 
assistant secretary for housing philip winn both were presidential 
appointees under thenhud secretary samuel pierce and later became 
ownerdevelopers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects 
winn is now the us ambassador to switzerland efforts to reach 
him through the state department were unsuccessful 
abrams did not return a reporters call to his colorado office 
others included joseph strauss a former special assistant to 
pierce who the report said collected 13 million in consultant 
fees on such projects pierces onetime executive assistant lance 
wilson was identified as an ownerdeveloper in six projects 
watt collected a 300000 fee as a consultant on a 312unit 
project in essex md investigators reported that he said that 
his role was to talk to the right people and convice them that 
the project was needed the report said 
it said nunn was paid 375000 as attorney and consultant on a 
1984 miami project in which he in turn paid mitchell 75000 for 
his assistance 
nunn claimed mitchell told him he had hud contacts from the 
top on down because he and pierce were friends the report 
said pierce told investigators that he knew mitchell but that 
mitchell had never discussed hud matters with him 
brooke was paid 183000 as consultant most of that in a lynn 
mass deal also named as a consultant who received 260000 in 
fees was frederick bush no relation to the president who has been 
nominated as ambassador to luxembourg 
calls to watt nunn and brooke were not immediately returned

the state department criticized the government 
of gen manuel antonio noriega of panama on thursday for detaining 
an american reporter who allegedly passed a dollar that had 
antinoriega slogans on it 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said charles lane a newsweek 
reporter based in el salvador was taken into custody wednesday and 
held for several hours by the panama defense forces he was 
unharmed 
at no time were there any charges against mr lane ms 
tutwiler said calling the incident a typical instance of an 
absence of political freedom and basic civil liberties in panama 
she said the panamanians staged a deliberate effort to 
intimidate an independent journalist in the context of a national 
election which gen noriega would have the world believe will 
represent the free expression of the will of the people of panama 
its domestic opponents and those able to give a true picture of the 
noriega regime to the world 
presidential elections are scheduled in panama for may 7 
bob rivard chief of correspondents for newsweek said in a 
telephone interview from new york that lane had been held for six 
hours and interrogated several times 
the editors of newsweek regard chucks detention as 
unwarranted and a very cynical exercise on the part of the 
military rivard said he had done nothing wrong

house democrats concerned about a naval 
strategic modernization plans compatability with a ussoviet 
arms control treaty sent a letter thursday to president bush urging 
him to review the proposal 
navy officials have told congress they want a force of at least 
20 trident submarines equipped with a high number of missile tubes 
24 rather than more submarines with fewer tubes 
in the letter the lawmakers asked for a better plan in order 
to maintain a robust naval strategic fleet and strengthen our 
current arms control negotiating posture 
under the scenarios proposed to congress the navy would 
retain over 4000 strategic warheads the lawmakers said 
however the proposals or the tridents missile tube 
configuration may need to be revised 
former president reagan and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev agreed to limit each country to 4900 ballistic missile 
warheads under a ussoviet strategic arms reduction treaty the 
navy plan would leave fewer than 900 warheads for landbased 
missiles the lawmakers said 
if we continue to procure one trident per year as currently 
configured we may end up buying tridents in excess of those we 
would deploy under start the letter also says this may force 
premature retirements of one or more tridents forfeiting a 
multibilliondollar expenditure 
among the possible options the letter suggests is redesign of 
the trident to carry fewer missile tubes research on a smaller 
strategic submarine or slowing down production of the trident 
i am concerned that the navy may be going down a blind alley 
with its strategic modernization plan said rep tom foglietta 
dpa one of the signees of the letter it appears incompatible 
with the current arms control framework 
rep charles bennett dfla chairman of the house armed 
services seapower subcommittee raised the issue with the deputy 
chief of naval operations for plans policy and operations at a 
congressional hearing 
vice adm charles r larson said the trident gives the navy the 
necessary flexibility and survivability and another witness 
robert g joseph deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear 
forces and arms control policy cautioned against strategy based 
on a ussoviet treaty 
the last thing we want to do now is act as if we have an 
agreement in start joseph said 
in addition to foglietta the house members who signed the 
letter were les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services

seniors at a highachieving high school 
sabotaged their answers on a test that measures the schools 
academic quality and one said the diminished scores were a 
rebellion against pressure to perform 
administrators at west high school denied there was too much 
pressure and a spokeswoman for the state department of education 
suggested that dragging down the schools score on the california 
assessment test may have been sparked by something else 
i think it would be interesting to know what else is going on 
at that campus the last time this happened at a school a few years 
ago students were mad at the administration for putting speed 
bumps in the parking lot said state department of education 
spokeswoman susie lange 
she said officials at the education departments testing office 
have talked to the school and said there was no chance of getting 
a second test 
the results are used to determine a schools academic placement 
compared to other schools in the state the results are published 
in newspapers and are considered by the state for achievement 
awards and grants home buyers use the results when a good school 
district is a consideration 
reading scores at west high school dropped from the 85th 
percentile statewide last year to the 51st percentile this year and 
math scores fell from the 95th percentile in 198788 to 71st 
percentile this year 
we thought that it was the wrong high school said principal 
william bawden and then we got some rumors that maybe some of 
the seniors had sabotaged the test 
he said a check of students test booklets which are not 
signed showed an unusual number of wrong answers in 18 booklets 
including some booklets that contained no right answers bawden 
said one student admitted deliberately doing badly on the test he 
denied extraordinary pressure was placed on students to do well 
bill franchini head of the torrance teacher association said 
thursday he had talked to teachers at west high school in this los 
angeles suburb and said he was unaware of any extra problems or 
pressure that would have caused the sabotage 
but franchini said the cap test is a ripe target for angry 
students since names are not on the tests and the results are 
averaged for the entire school 
a lot of these seniors have been tested perhaps over 
tested said franchini they have the california test of basic 
skills the scholastic aptitude test and various achievement 
tests they are tested tested tested so when this one comes 
along and it doesnt have their name on it they may think well 
so what 
student body president kelle price said tuesday some seniors 
became disgruntled when teachers interrupted classes to prepare 
students for the test and when administrators visited classes 
stressing the importance of doing well 
they said this is the test that is the schools report card 
said ms price and west is a really good school and that we all 
want to keep it up i think a lot of people resented that she 
said she did not participate in the sabotage 
franchini disagreed with ms prices allegation that 
extraordinary pressure was brought on students 
lange said the last time a test was sabotaged was in 198485 
when cap scores were tied to state cash bonuses to the schools 
that program has been cancelled she said the students at one 
school said they would do poorly on the test to protest speed bumps 
placed in their parking lot 
the damage is done she said of the results at west its 
not hurting them its hurting their younger brothers and sisters 
they have broken the schools trend

an independent government agency that monitors 
the medicare program will submit a report to congress on friday 
urging change in the way the program pays physicians to make the 
system more fair and to help cut soaring costs 
the physician payment review commission recommends a uniform fee 
structure that would be based on the actual costs of providing 
services fees would be set at national rates for the 7000 medical 
services covered by medicare and the rates would be adjusted to 
reflect geographical cost differences 
currently medicare pays physicians based on what they and other 
doctors in their area customarily charge a system that critics say 
is neither fair nor efficient 
the current system pays less for evaluation and management 
services typically provided by family practice and internal 
medicine physicians than for surgical and other invasive 
procedures relative to the time and effort required of the doctor 
under the payment system the commission proposes fees would be 
raised for family practitioners and lowered for many specialty 
physicians including surgeons and ophthalmologists 
the proposed system would be based on a plan developed by the 
harvard university school of public health that plan sets fees for 
services based on the costs of a doctors education training and 
equipment as well as the mental and physical effort and technical 
skill and judgment required of the physician 
the commission also proposes to limit the amount physicians can 
charge medicare patients for a service beyond the amount approved 
by medicare 
medicare has been one of the fastest growing sections of the 
federal budget with last years expenditures rising more than 15 
percent over the preceding year 
much of the increase in medicare outlays for physicians 
services has come from an increase in the volume of services 
provided according to the commissions report from 1980 to 1988 
the number of services provided per medicare enrollees has 
increased by 7 percent per year the report said 
the report says many of these services have little or no benefit 
to patients the commission calls for more research on the 
effectiveness of medical services and the development of guidelines 
to reduce the use of procedures that have minimal benefit and thus 
cut medicare costs 
the commissions plan also proposes to set expenditure targets 
based on estimates of inflation and growth in beneficiaries and 
services these would work as incentives for physicians the 
commission said if expenditures come in at the target one year 
the next years physicians fees would be increased at the rate of 
inflation if expenditures exceeded the target physicians fees 
would be increased by the rate of inflation minus the amount 
exceeding the target conversely if expenditures were under the 
target fees would be increased by inflation plus the amount under 
target 
its a mechanism for gaining control over the growth in 
spending and to provide the financial incentives for physicians to 
take more seriously the need to control the volume of services 
said lauren leroy commission deputy director

a crowd of more than 5000 mostly 
schoolchildren chanted and sang political songs as they marched 
six miles behind a un convoy carrying released swapo guerrillas 
toward the border thursday 
the crowd began gathering at dawn at ongwediva lutheran mission 
station where 31 guerillas spent the night after greeting streams 
of namibian peasants who came to see them and participate in a 
church service 
most black schools in the area around the garrison town of 
oshakati were closed thursday as the students marched 
un police monitors watched the procession which grew larger 
as it progressed southwest african police were barely visible 
and army patrols were nonexistent the south africancontrolled 
military was restricted to base from wednesday to saturday to allow 
the estimated 600 guerrillas in the territory a safe route to the 
border 
the southwest african peoples organization guerrillas 
endangered a un independence plan for namibia when they crossed 
the border from angola on april 1 under the plan they were to 
wait in their angolan bases until midmay when they were to return 
unarmed as refugees to take part in november elections 
south africancontrolled military forces which had been 
confined to base in accordance with the plan were released to 
fight the swapo incursion according to namibia 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar the battles caused the deaths 
of 305 infiltrators and 27 security force members 
the united nations said thursday at windhoek the territorial 
capital that 3941 military personnel from 21 countries are 
deployed in namibia to help monitor the transition to independence 
the south african military on wednesday turned over to the 
united nations 31 guerrillas captured in the fighting 
at midday thursday 28 of them walked across the border at 
ruacana and got into trucks to carry them to their bases 100 miles 
to the north a territorial official said three injured fighters 
were taken elsewhere to recuperate 
the united nations is supervising a transition period and

edward l rowny a senior us arms control 
adviser accused the soviet union on thursday of seeking military 
advantage even as it appeals to public opinion seeking arms 
reductions 
rowny said in a speech prepared for delivery in san antonio the 
soviets play to the grandstand of public opinion while masking 
their own very real efforts to achieve military advantage 
the former us negotiator who advises president bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii on arms control issues said 
the soviets were trying to promote a positive image in the west and 
divide the nato alliance at the same time 
in the speech to the national war college alumni association 
rowny challenged soviet sincerity on withdrawing tanks from eastern 
europe and on the issue of shortrange nuclear missiles 
while soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said in january that 
none of the 10000 tanks to be withdrawn would remain in the soviet 
military inventory rowny quoted gen bv snetkov the soviet 
commander in east germany as saying last week that some of the 
tanks would remain in the soviet arsenal 
on shortrange missiles rowny accused the soviets of 
propaganda he said while foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
has objected to improving natos weapons the soviets have been 
modernizing their own missiles for a decade 
rowny said the soviets are replacing the ss23 missiles banned 
by the ussoviet intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty with 
scuds that have a range of 300 miles and have been replacing frog 
missiles with ss21s with potentially greater range and accuracy 
the warsaw pact has an advantage of at least 16 to 1 over the 
north atlantic treaty organization in missiles below the range of 
315 miles rowny said 
within the nato alliance west germany is resisting us efforts 
to extend the range of lance missiles and has called for us 
negotiations with the soviets to scale back such weapons the bush 
administration with support from britain and france has rejected 
the west german overture 
on this issue rowny said the soviets have created a 
credibility gap so wide one could drive a tank through it 
he said the soviets have tried to make arms control the main 
focus of their relations with the united states because they 
believe that serves soviet interests 
preoccupation with arms control diverts attention from the 
critical underlying causes of eastwest tension which the soviets 
cleary recognize the differences in the values of our respective 
social systems rowny said

an aggressive conservation effort by electric 
power companies could sharply reduce consumers utility bills and 
save the companies millions of dollars in pollutioncontrol costs 
according to a study released thursday 
the center for clean air policy a washingtonbased think tank 
said its 18month study showed that cutting electricity use would 
help both consumers and the utilities as well as reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by substantial amounts 
fossil fuels burned in power plants and by other energy 
producers are blamed for the release of large amounts of carbon 
dioxide which is considered to be a major contributor to global 
warming 
the study focused on potential savings to two of the nations 
largest electric utility systems the tennessee valley authority 
and the american electric power co of columbus ohio 
a 7 percent cut in electricity sales by american electric by the 
year 2000 would reduce by 26 percent or 51 million the amount it 
would have to pay for pollution controls over that period 
a 10 percent drop in sales by tva over the same period would 
reduce its pollution control costs by 55 percent or 77 million 
the study said 
these energy conservation programs would save american 
electrics customers 123 billion over the next 30 years the 
study said tvas customers would save 891 million over the same 
period the savings are based in part on the assumption that lower 
demand would preclude the need for the utilities to invest in new 
generation capacity 
its time we started addressing our basic environmental 
problems through approaches like energy conservation which 
eliminate pollution rather than just moving it from the air into 
the ground or water said tony earl the study groups chairman

the food and drug administration said thursday 
it will allow a potentially promising new aids drug to be tested on 
people infected with the deadly virus 
researchers say the drug known as glq223 is unique because it 
appears to kill only those immune system cells that are infected 
with the aids virus leaving noninfected cells alone 
however they caution that the drug so far has been tested only 
in the laboratory and has not been used on aids patients 
im very optimistic because of the test tube results but 
theres always the possibility it could have unpredictable side 
effects or when given to humans the drug may not be able to get to 
all the infected cells said dr michael mcgrath of the 
university of california in san francisco and san francisco general 
hospital 
mcgrath led a team of scientists from ucsf the chinese 
university of hong kong and genelabs of redwood city calif that 
developed glq223 
the drug is a highly purified form of the plant protein 
trichosanthin which is derived from the root of a chinese cucumber 
plant the plant extract has been used in china to induce abortions 
in the laboratory the drug has been found to work on two 
different types of cells crucial to the normal functioning of the 
immune system tcells and macrophage cells which act as a 
reservoir for the virus 
azt the only drug now licensed for treatment of aids and other 
drugs like it only prevent the virus from replicating in tcells 
david corkery a spokesman for the american foundation for aids 
research called the drug very promising and said he is 
cautiously optimistic about its prospects 
genelabs said thursday the clinical trials are expected to begin 
in may at san francisco general hospital primarily to determine 
safety and human tolerance of the drug mcgrath said the trials are 
expected to last three to six months 
if a safe dosage can be determined then trials would be 
conducted on the effectiveness of the drug 
genelabs also cautioned that though glq223s active ingredient 
is found in some chinese herbal medicines such preparations may 
also contain other components with unknown toxic effects 
also the company said that since the toxicity of trichosanthin 
itself has not been evaluated in aids patients it cautions 
against the use of trichosanthin or trichosanthincontaining 
preparations as an aids therapy 
the drug is being developed with money from the swiss chemical 
and pharmaceutical company sandoz ltd which would have rights to 
market it

the agriculture department said thursday it 
has approved a request for the first field testing of two 
genetically altered potato varieties which could be resistant to 
three destructive plant viruses 
a permit to conduct the test was approved for monsanto 
agricultural co st louis mo said james w glosser 
administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service 
glosser said the field testing of both diseaseresistant 
varieties will begin later this month near jersey ill and that 
one of the varieties also will be tested in nampa idaho 
the experimental design of these trials is sound and should 
provide important scientific data without causing any significant 
impact on the environment he said 
three diseasecausing organisms leaf roll virus virus x and 
virus y infect potato crops causing yellowing and stunting of 
plants glosser said depending on conditions the viruses can 
cause a 5 percent to 10 percent yield loss or more as well as a 
drop in product quality 
the monsanto potato varieties were developed by taking genetic 
material from the viruses and inserting it into the potato in 
greenhouse studies the company found that the material produced 
proteins in the potatoes which protected them from disease 
in a related development the departments agricultural research 
service said the first outdoor test of cotton genetically 
engineered to kill caterpillar pests began on thursday the cotton 
project was announced two weeks ago 
the new cotton variety is being tested on a oneacre site at 
mississippi state university starkville miss 
a gene from a common bacterium bacillus thuringienensis was 
inserted into the cotton plant the gene produces a protein that is 
toxic to caterpillartype insects but not to humans 
the cotton was engineered by scientists at agracetus inc 
middleton wis if successful the new variety could protect itself 
against such pests as the bollworm tobacco budworm and armyworm

novelist salman rushdie in hiding under death 
threats from irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was spirited away 
from a dinner by police worried about moslem students nearby a 
newspaper said thursday 
the daily mail said rushdie was attending a private dinner party 
with professors at an oxford university college 
it said detectives spotted moslem students near the college and 
fearing an attempt on his life the officers interrupted the 
author during the party with dons instructors and spirited him 
out of a side entrance 
the paper said rushdie was driven away in an armored car and 
officers worried whether a security lapse had led to details of the 
party leaking out 
the mail did not say when the reported incident occurred and 
police declined comment the office of rushdies agent gillon 
aitken who acts as his spokesman did not return a phone call 
rushdie went into hiding 10 weeks ago after khomeini ruled that 
his novel the satanic verses blasphemed islam and ordered 
moslems to find him and kill him 
many moslems contend the book is blasphemous because it includes 
a scene in which prostitutes take the names of the prophet 
mohammeds wives and it suggests mohammed wrote the holy koran 
instead of receiving it from allah 
on wednesday night five moslem women protesting a new play 
defending the right of rushdie and other writers to freedom of 
expression invaded the stage at londons royal court theater and 
halted the performance for 10 minutes 
the oneact play iranian nights was nearly over when the 
women staged their peaceful protest a theater spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
attendants escorted the women off the stage and out of the 
theater and the play resumed without further interruption no 
arrests were made 
the play is by dramatist howard brenton and tariq ali a 
wellknown leftwing student activist in london in the 1960s it 
covers issues raised by the events surrounding rushdie and the 
satanic verses 
the times of london meanwhile quoted rushdies agent aitken 
thursday as saying he believed rushdie was eager for his book to be 
published in paperback toward the end of the year despite warnings 
from moslem leaders in britain that it would inflame the 
controversy 
aitken was quoted as saying there had been little discussion 
with rushdie about paperback publication but i think he is keen 
that this book should be published in the way that his other books 
have been published 
viking penguin rushdies hardcover and paperback publisher 
said there were no plans at this stage for a paperback edition 
the times said rushdie telephones aitken at his office about 
twice a week to discuss the books sales 
on march 17 iran broke diplomatic ties with britain after 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe defended rushdies 
right to freedom of speech and to publish his book 
prime minister margaret thatchers government subsequently 
ordered the expulsion of 18 iranians from britain saying they were 
perceived as a security threat iran retaliated by ordering 18 
britons either to be expelled from iran or not allowed back into 
britain 
in barcelona spain 18 companies said thursday they planned to 
jointly publish a spanish edition of the satanic verses

the antibalding drug minoxidil promotes hair 
growth apparently by affecting gene activity a finding with 
implications for the treatment of genetic disorders upjohn co 
researchers said thursday 
minoxidil has been marketed by upjohn under the trade name 
rogaine since its approval by federal regulators in september but 
the way the drug makes hair grow has been poorly understood 
researchers had previously suggested the drug stimulated the 
flow of blood to the scalp and hair roots thereby promoting growth 
our experiments do not negate the bloodflow hypothesis but 
they do demonstrate that the drug directly enhances growth and 
maturation of cells that form hair shafts said allen buhl an 
upjohn researcher 
knowledge of growth gained from study of minoxidils effects on 
cell growth could have implications for research into genetically 
based diseases such as sicklecell anemia buhl said although 
some scientists voiced skepticism about that contention 
minoxidil was originally developed for internal use as a 
treatment for high blood pressure as an antibalding drug it is 
applied externally to the scalp 
vincent groppi jr another upjohn researcher said minoxidil 
was applied to whiskers removed from mice and placed in cultures in 
a petri dish other whiskers were left untreated as a control on 
the experiment 
after three days hair treated with minoxidil had grown while 
the untreated hair had not 
further work showed that the minoxidil not only affects 
growing cells but affects cells that make hairshaft protein 
groppi said minoxidil affects gene activity that affects the 
growth of the hair shaft 
another scientist however was skeptical that the upjohn 
finding represented a significant advance 
within our cells we have between 50000 and 100000 genes 
and many of those genes probably at least several thousand are 
poised to respond to the effects of different kinds of 
stimulants said robert weinberg biology professor at the 
massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge mass it 
would be rare for a physiological stimulant including this drug 
not to affect the expression of one or another gene 
although the drug may affect hair follicles there is no reason 
to believe that the drug would have similar affects on other types 
of cells weinberg said 
weinberg said the research would have been more compelling had 
it identified a specific gene or group of genes affected by the 
drug upjohn spokeswoman kaye bennett said in kalamazoo mich 
that the researchers hadnt identified a specific gene 
weinberg also cautioned against concluding that effects on hair 
in a culture would also be seen on hair growing in tissue such as 
on the scalp 
in a culture it is meaningless because cells in culture 
behave differently than when they are sitting in tissue weinberg 
said 
upjohns bennett said that although the research was performed 
on hair in cultures we do feel that what were looking at here 
is an accurate indication of the effectiveness of minoxidil 
the upjohn research was abstracted in the may issue of the 
journal for investigative dermatology and was to be presented in 
full saturday at the annual meeting of the society for 
investigative dermatology

an arab league delegation failed thursday to 
persuade secretary of state james a baker iii to reopen the 
palestine liberation organization office here 
there is no change in our policy a state department 
official said after the 45minute meeting 
clovis maksoud the arab leagues representative here said he 
had the impression baker was not opposed to reopening the 
office but he wants to have the proper timing and the proper 
circumstances maksoud told reporters 
the office was closed in march 1988 after congress declared the 
plo a terrorist organization since then however the united 
states has held a series of meetings with the plo and is seeking 
its support for mideast peace talks 
maksoud said the arab delegation told baker the office should be 
reopened in light of the talks begun by the reagan administration 
in december 
however a state department official who spoke to a reporter on 
condition of anonymity said no change was contemplated 
the delegation also disagreed with baker on a proposal by 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to have palestinian arabs on 
the west bank and in gaza elect leaders to negotiate an interim 
selfrule arrangement 
president bush and baker have endorsed the proposal as a useful 
and encouraging step toward an arabisraeli settlement 
but maksoud said it was an attempt by israel to frustrate the 
international outrage concerning the practices of israel in the 
occupied territories 
he called the proposal a charade designed to undermine the 
plo which the arab league has declared the only legitimate 
representative of palestinians 
on a third point there was apparent agreement 
maksoud and ambassadors saud alsabah of kuwait and mohsin a 
alaini of north yemen described to baker a plan by the arab league 
to enforce a ceasefire in lebanon with soldiers from several arab 
countries 
maksoud said baker expressed appreciation for the leagues 
efforts while the us official said baker had restated strong 
support for the peace initiative and a need for a ceasefire 
the country is torn by warfare between christian and moslem 
factions with 40000 syrian troops playing a dominant role in much 
of the country

ethiopias president is willing to allow 
ethiopian jews to emigrate and rejoin families from whom they have 
been separated since a secret airlift to israel was halted a 
congressman said thursday 
rep mickey leland dtexas the chairman of the house select 
committee on hunger said he received the assurances of president 
mengistu haile mariam at a meeting in addis ababa during congress 
easter recess 
leland also defended ethiopias role in efforts to deliver 
emergency food supplies to thousands of starving people in 
rebelheld southern sudan 
while acknowledging that ethiopia wasnt working with the united 
nations relief efforts leland claimed they were taking other steps 
to help get food across the border before the rainy season arrives 
in may and makes roads impassable 
recognition of ethiopias cooperation in the urgent 
humanitarian mission to save the people of southern sudan is 
imperative to future efforts towards establishing peace throughout 
the horn of africa leland told a news conference 
leland said some news reports have unfairly painted 
sovietbacked ethiopia as a villain in the emergency relief 
effort to supply food to sudanese people caught in the countrys 
civil war 
although ethiopia is not working with the un operation 
lifeline leland said 5000 to 7000 metric tons of food is en 
route to sudan under a joint relief program of private voluntary 
and church organizations headquartered in the capital of addis 
ababa 
roughly 120 trucks are needed for the jointrelief effort 
separate from the uns mission and leland said ethiopia is 
providing at least half of those vehicles 
they are allowing for crossborder operations to happen just 
not under the auspices of the un said leland who also visited 
sudan to assess the situation when it comes to feeding the 
hungry we should not take potshots because ethiopia doesnt 
agree with us ideologically 
on the issue of ethiopian jews leland said in an interview that 
mengistu assured him recently in that he is committed to family 
reunification and that the issue is a project we can work on 
mutually 
there are families who are being reunited leland said 
the ethiopian government has been forthcoming about allowing 
families to be reunified and i expect more of that will be realized 
as time goes on 
like the soviet union ethiopia restricts the emigration of its 
people 
more than 10000 ethiopian jews remain in what leland said is 
the poorest country in the world peasants who were left behind 
after an exodus in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
between november 1984 and the first days of 1985 an estimated 
7000 ethiopian jews were airlifted to israel joining about 6000 
who had made their way to israel earlier before ethiopia imposed 
emigration restrictions 
the secret operation in late 1984 was stopped when the belgian 
charter company flying the refugees to israel through europe balked 
at the publicity in the international press 
the ethiopian jews trace their roots in judaism back 2600 
years american jews have supported efforts to bring the ethiopian 
jews to israel 
leland said he did not ask mengistu for any numbers on how many 
ethiopian jews had been reunited with their families in israel and 
elsewhere in the world

us health inc accepted a consent order 
thursday to settle allegations it discouraged blacks from joining 
the 40 holiday spa health clubs it operates in five east coast 
metropolitan areas 
in a settlement approved by a federal judge the towson 
mdbased company did not admit or deny any of the allegations it 
accepted the consent order negotiated with justice department 
attorneys who filed the lawsuit on feb 10 enjoining any 
discrimination by holiday spas 
in the settlement the company agreed to show black people in 
advertising and to include a statement that it does not 
discriminate against minorities 
the consent order approved by us district judge john h 
pratt also directs the company to give blacks who may have been 
turned away another opportunity to join the club 
the company operates 40 health clubs in the washington boston 
philadelphia baltimore and atlanta metropolitan areas 
james turner acting assistant attorney general for civil 
rights said in a statement the case was resolved quickly because 
there was absolutely no reason no excuse and no defense in how 
these defendants were conducting business decades after these 
antidiscrimination laws went into effect 
turner noted that the consent order contains an elaborate 
procedure to ensure that all personnel of the company from top 
executives through individual club employees receive comprehensive 
training in the subject of racial fairness 
in a press release read by washington attorney basil j 
mezines the company said it did not admit any of the allegations 
in the original complaint agree to any fines or the legal 
contentions made by the justice department 
the statement quoted barry mandel holidays vice president as 
saying we at holiday have never discriminated against any 
prospective member or a member and our clubs are open to all who 
comport themselves in accepted manners 
the consent order said it was not to be considered in any way 
an admission or finding of any discrimination by the company 
but it contained a statement of evidence the justice department 
would have produced at trial including a summary of testimony from 
black applicants who would have said they were not told of the 
least expensive membership packages or the most favorable loan 
rates 
former employees were prepared to testify that they were 
instructed to tell black applicants that no one was available to 
give them tours of the health clubs the statement said 
black members would have testified that they received rude 
treatment from club employees former employees would testify 
that black members were treated in this manner to discourage them 
from utilizing the club facilities and to discourage them from 
recommending the club to other black persons the statement said 
former employees were also prepared to testify they were 
reprimanded by club managers for selling memberships to blacks and 
that they often did not receive commissions for these sales

random drug testing is nothing more than 
looking for a needle in a haystack and isnt necessary to prevent 
drug and alcoholrelated train accidents railroad unions told 
congress on thursday 
the unions told rep thomas luken dohio he could accomplish 
his goal of safer railways without making workers go through 
unnecessary tests 
there comes a point where enough is enough said james 
kennedy jr of the railway labor executives association which 
represents 17 unions 
rail workers now are subjected to numerous potential alcohol 
and drug tests each year he said in testimony to the house 
transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee 
new employees are screened for drugs before theyre hired he 
said once on the job workers are tested after accidents during 
physicals when they return to work after illnesses and when 
theres some suspicion of impairment 
a bill proposed by luken would require drug testing of all 
railroad workers with safety sensitive jobs set standards for 
the labs that do the testing and require that railroads maintain 
rehabilitation programs 
the supreme court ruled march 21 that the federal railroad 
administrations current drugtesting regulations are 
constitutional 
the random drugtesting allowed under the supreme court decision 
would be limited under lukens bill 
s mark lindsey the fras chief counsel told the subcommittee 
the bill would set in concrete some testing options that 
could far exceed actual safety needs 
the administration favors no changes to the policies supported 
by the high court he said 
united transportation union president fred hardin said he feared 
mandatory random drug and alcohol testing would give railroads an 
excuse to cancel costly rehabilitation programs 
hardin compared rail workers to longhaul independent truckers 
there are thousands of gypsy truck drivers operating their 
trucks over our nations highways utilizing medicinal aids to stay 
awake and continue driving their trucks for unrealistic periods of 
time he told the subcommittee which luken heads 
why not propose requirements for random testing of both truck 
and automobile drivers 
the association of american railroads said it supported the idea 
of random drug testing but didnt like lukens plan because it 
singles out railroads from other forms of transportation 
association president william dempsey also said he disagreed 
with a proposal to force railroads to guarantee that workers who 
have completed drug or alcohol rehabilitation are reinstated in 
their jobs 
luken interpreted the complaints from both labor and ownership 
as a positive sign 
frankly that tells me that we are on to something here he 
said 
his bill duplicates a measure that passed the house in the last 
session

three babies were hospitalized in england but were released 
after doctors found they were not harmed by contaminated food 
hospital authorities said the only victims so far are a 
9monthold girl who cut her mouth on a piece of razor blade in a 
jar of yogurt and two mothers cut by glass hidden in baby food 
police said the total number of reported cases stood at about 
220 
not all the reported cases have been confirmed police say the 
majority of cases are probably the work of copycats people 
getting on the bandwagon cranks and some cases of 
selfcontamination an unidentified police detective said 
according to press association the british domestic news agency 
he said they believe there may be some cases of people putting 
items in food in a bid to claim compensation from companies but 
the vast majority will be by cranks and copycats 
we are not pointing the finger at mothers people are 
genuinely finding contaminants in food the detective was quoted 
as saying 
scotland yard said no one has been arrested in connection with 
the contamination but that some people were arrested locally for 
hoaxes a yard spokesman had no details of the hoaxes 
hj heinz co ltd and cow and gate ltd which together 
control nearly 80 percent of britains baby food market on 
wednesday offered a joint reward totaling 169000 for information 
leading to the conviction of the extortionists 
usowned heinz said it had received an extortion demand it 
refused to disclose it issued a statement thursday saying it had 
not paid any money and never would cow and gate owned by nutricia 
of the netherlands said it had not received a demand 
police said only two of the reported cases were definitely 
linked to the heinz threat 
police and government officials refused to comment on newspaper 
reports that the extortionists were paid 850000 this year and 
were now demanding an additional 17 million 
scotland yard which is coordinating the hunt for the saboteurs 
refused to comment on the investigation the daily telegraph a 
respected conservative daily said detectives from 12 countries 
were searching for the extortionists 
local police forces reported 91 cases of suspected baby food 
contamination including five in northern ireland and 21 more 
unconfirmed cases across the border in the republic of ireland 
police said two cases were under investigation 
home office minister john patten said wednesday that 28 
incidents of tampering with jars and cans of baby food had been 
reported since april 7 including 11 on wednesday 
mothers reported finding glass shards pins needles broken 
razor blades stones and caustic baby soda in jars and cans of baby 
food and in one case in powdered milk most were in heinz or cow 
and gate products but several were in other brands of baby food 
heinz and cow and gate have not pulled their baby food products 
off supermarket shelves in stores where contaminated jars and cans 
have been found all stock has been replaced 
both companies have said their internal investigations have 
determined that their products were not tampered with during 
production 
press association said scotland yard detectives believe the 
extortionists may have mastered a sophisticated technique of 
resealing jars the small glass jars have metal lids with an 
indented center that indicates the vacuum seal has not been broken 
in its statement thursday heinz said police have stressed 
that there has not at any time been a need for a general or batch 
recall of baby food products 
the company stressed that a general withdrawal of the products 
would not solve external tampering the problem would reappear at 
any future date on heinz products or any other food products sold 
in grocery outlets 
several newspapers including the daily telegraph and the times 
of london said the extortionists had demanded 17 million the 
times said heinz was the target the telegraph said both heinz and 
cow and gate were the targets 
the telegraph said police believe a gang that extorted 85000 
from a large supermarket chain this year by threatening to poison 
food on its shelves turned its attention last month to heinz and 
cow and gate

the house budget committee approved on 
thursday a fiscal 1990 spending plan designed to carry out a 
deficitreduction agreement with president bush but still reflect 
congressional plans for domestic programs 
the 117 trillion plan adopted by a bipartisan vote of 186 
calls for new user fees sales of government assets and 53 
billion in unspecified new revenue while restraining spending 
growth in defense and in some domestic areas 
the budget is designed to reduce the federal deficit next year 
by roughly 27 billion to less than 100 billion as required by 
the grammrudman deficit law however even its sponsors described 
it as only a modest accomplishment 
theres not a lot of deficit reduction in this package said 
rep bill frenzel rminn senior republican on the committee 
and committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said he hoped to 
work toward a bolder resolution in the future panetta and 
frenzel both participated in the white house talks and jointly 
offered the budget adopted by the committee 
earlier at a breakfast meeting with reporters panetta said 
congress and the white house might have to seek more spending cuts 
or taxes as early as this summer if deficit estimates worsen in the 
next few months 
panetta after the committee meeting predicted the budget would 
pass the house next week the senate budget committee produced its 
version last week and full senate action is also expected next week 
the 53 billion in new revenue called for in the white house 
pact remains a matter of contention bush has insisted that rather 
than a tax increase the additional revenue would be raised by 
cutting the rate on capital gains income 
the chairmen of the house and senate tax committees have given 
bushs capitalgains proposal little chance of approval but talks 
continue 
theres a fivepointthree number hanging out there frenzel 
said 
a list of proposed user fees in the house committee version of 
the budget obtained by reporters includes new levies on a wide 
range of government services 
they include fees for inspection of imported foods charging 
federal insurance fees for bank deposits held by foreigners 
additional levies on the nuclear power industry and new or 
extended charges for veterans home loans and national flood 
insurance 
the two current versions of the budget which must be reconciled 
by the two chambers before the budget resolution becomes final are 
necessarily similar because of the white house agreement earlier 
this month between bush and congressional leaders 
military spending in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 would be 
about 2992 billion with total spending authority some of which 
may be spent after the end of the fiscal year of 3055 billion 
foreign aid spending would be 167 billion 
growth in the medicare program would be trimmed about 27 
billion there would be no cuts in social security benefits 
but while overall spending by federal agencies was set by the 
agreement the house and senate had slightly different priorities 
the senate allocated more money for agriculture energy 
transportation and law enforcement programs while the house favored 
spending on education health and veterans according to figures 
released by the house panel bush for the most part did not spell 
out priorities among those programs but he agreed in the deficit 
pact to increase them overall to keep pace with inflation 
panetta and frenzel said the house committee unlike the senate 
panel produced detailed recommendations on how money would be 
spent in each area for examle frenzel said the extra money put in 
the science and space category would allow congress a chance to 
keep alive both the space station and superconducting supercollider 
science projects 
much of what the house committee decided was done behind closed 
doors and not revealed during the public session those policy 
choices will be included in the committee report published next 
week 
the press release by the committee touted popular spending in 
the package 
the budget would clear the way for new federal child care and 
child health and education spending paents crime 
initiative with more money than he requested for the war on drugs 
and provide 19 billion to fight aids it said federal civilian 
and military employees wouldy for the presid get a 36 percent pay boost 
in its open session the committee rejected an amendment by rep 
marcy kaptur dohio to increase veterans health spending 150 
million beyond what was approved in the private meetings panetta 
said the committee level was still well above the level recommended 
by bush or passed by the senate 
the budget does not itself authorize federal spending it serves 
as the guideline for the annual spending and tax bills that go 
through congress to the president 
if by oct 1 those bills dont reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit 
as projected by the white house to within 10 billion of the 
grammrudman target of 100 billion the administration must order 
automatic spending cuts to make029 040

treasury secretary nicholas brady on thursday 
rejected a proposal to reduce medicare catastrophic health 
insurance premiums that congressional analysts expect to generate a 
bigger surplus than is needed 
brady in a letter to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the 
insurance program is literally in its first few months of life 
and the administration wants to be sure it is not left with 
insufficient reserves 
the new insurance program approved by congress last year 
provides extended coverage for the costs of hospital and medical 
care and drug benefits it is financed through a surtax paid by 
social security recipients 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee last week 
said he would move to reduce the surtax if the treasury department 
agreed with new congressional estimates that the surtax will yield 
a 91 billion surplus over a fiveyear period 
brady however said the administration expects the premiums to 
yield contingency reserves of 62 billion and finds no reason 
to revise that estimate or to allow for a smaller surplus 
until we gain experience with this program we believe that we 
must be cautious about funding brady stated in the letter 
he added that the administration believes the moderate cushion 
which is currently projected should be maintained 
earlier this week president bush issued a letter in which he 
said it would be imprudent to tinker with the new medicare 
program bush noted that that reserves could be used only for 
medicare and cannot be diverted to any other program or purpose 
bentsens office said it had not yet received bradys letter and 
had no immediate comment

the federal aviation administration on 
thursday announced 200000 in fines against air wisconsin for 
failure to conduct required inspections on three of its aircraft 
after repairs 
the faa does not consider planes to be airworthy until repairs 
have been inspected by qualified personnel other than those who 
made the repairs 
in one instance a fuel control lever was unsafely wired during 
maintenance resulting in the right engine of a twoengine plane 
being stuck at an 80 percent power level the faa said adding that 
an inspection would have caught the error 
the faa charged air wisconsin in an april 14 letter with using 
three of its aircraft on several passengercarrying flights after 
failing to check repairs 
two of the aircraft had received unverified repairs after being 
hit by birds and one was hit by lightning the faa said

king hussein swore in his tough former army 
commander as prime minister thursday after widespread rioting and 
told him to reorganize the government and prepare for jordans 
first general elections in 22 years 
staterun jordan tv showed the swearingin ceremony for zeid bin 
shaker and said hussein issued 19 directives to the new government 
including calls for freedom of the press support for the plo and 
stamping out corruption 
but the king also told the government to put an end to the 
involvement of religion in politics an apparent reference to 
islamic fundamentalists accused of encouraging the unrest 
bin shaker takes office after the kingdoms worst domestic 
violence since 1971 riots stemming from government price increases 
and economic difficulties killed at least nine people last week in 
southern jordan government buildings and banks were attacked in 
dozens of cities and villages 
the new government will be a temporary one charged with 
overseeing the general elections which will take place very 
soon hussein was quoted as telling the kuwaiti newspaper 
alseyassah 
the 24man cabinet includes seven palestinianborn men down 
from 10 in the previous 26member cabinet 
but that appeared enough to assert husseins continuing claim to 
represent palestinians in the kingdom despite his decision to sever 
ties with the west bank last year palestinians make up half of 
jordans population of 3 million 
the king vowed continued support for the palestine liberation 
organization and noninterference in their local affairs 
distancing himself further from the west bank he ruled until 1967 
when it was seized by israel 
the new government includes nine cabinet holdovers including 
foreign minister marwan kassem 
bin shaker 55 a longtime friend and adviser of the king is 
best known for his military role in crushing palestinian guerrillas 
in jordan in 1970 and 1971 he was armed forces commander in chief 
until last year when hussein made him chief of palace advisers and 
special adviser on security affairs he still holds field marshals 
rank and enjoys high prestige in the army 
in thursdays message hussein alluded to charges of corruption 
and profiteering leveled against zaid rifai the replaced prime 
minister whose name was chanted in rage by rioters 
hussein ordered his ministers to reexamine jordans tax laws 
with an eye to fairness and to uproot corruption wherever it is 
he demanded stronger channels of communication between the 
people and the government including the right of expression and 
freedom of the press rifai who resigned on monday nationalized 
jordans already docile newspapers during his fouryear tenure 
the riots were set off by 10 to 50 percent price rises for 
gasoline and cigarettes and other commodities on top of an economic 
slide that cut yearly per capita income to about 1200 from 2000 
alseyassah quoted hussein as saying an accumulation of 
factors led to the four days of riots and that the outgoing 
government was unable to communicate to the public an explanation 
of the recent economic measures 
hussein also was quoted as saying israel had a hand in 
spurring the riots to draw attention from the 16month palestinian 
uprising in israelioccupied territories 
in jerusalem israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin retorted 
thursday on stateowned israel radio if he said these things 
then it is absurd almost ridiculous 
both bin shaker and hussein were educated at victoria college in 
egypt and at britains sandhurst military academy 
bin shaker joined the army in 1953 the year hussein came to 
power and was by the kings side when hussein drove out to meet 
his troops amid gunfire and rallied them against an attempted coup 
in 1957 
bin shaker commanded an armored brigade in the 1967 war with 
israel

palestinian enforcers have stepped up a 
selfpolicing campaign targeting arabs who collaborate with israel 
or defy policies of the underground leadership 
an israeli defense ministry report obtained by the associated 
press said 960 attacks have been carried out on palestinians by 
other arabs with 33 killed and 63 wounded between the start of the 
uprising in december 1987 and the beginning of april 1989 
six additional palestinians were killed in recent days some 
accused of spying for israel and others the target of a new 
underground vice squad that has singled out drug dealers and 
prostitutes 
on thursday night an arab policeman jamil sheik hallil 37 
was stabbed by masked palestinians in the west bank village of 
nazlat iza for continuing to work with the israeli government 
despite warnings to quit arab reporters said he was taken to a 
hospital in israel for treatment they said 
the pace and severity of such attacks intensified this week as 
the proplo underground called in an underground leaflet for a 
day of accounting for the collaborators 
israeli officials claim palestinian underground leaders are 
creating a climate of fear in which moderates are intimidated from 
speaking freely or challenging the policies of yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organization 
we believe such violence has an impact on the voices we can 
hear coming from the palestinian population and its leaders it has 
an impact on political behavior and expressions said foreign 
ministry spokesman alon liel 
palestinians reject such claims saying a wide variety of 
political views are expressed in public as evidenced by a recent 
debate on whether palestinians should agree to an israeli proposal 
for elections 
i dont think we are in switzerland where there is a 
completely free flow of ideas but considering all the constraints 
palestinians have an ample opportunity to give opinions look at 
the elections people publicly expressed various points of view 
said daoud kuttab a palestinian journalist 
palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity defended 
the actions of the clandestine hit teams that cleanse the 
community of informers who risk the lives of antiisraeli 
activists sought by israeli security authorities 
the most recent victim was fayek erar who allegedly forged 
deeds and sold land to israelis he died in a barrage of bullets 
fired by three masked men who came to his house in the west bank 
village of ras atiya on wednesday 
in gaza city the body of jamal abdul hamid el nadi 39 was 
found stabbed and beaten march 25 a leaflet pinned to his chest 
was signed by the strike forces of the state of palestine and 
said this is the fate of all who collaborate with the zionists 
and deal with drugs 
palestinians sources who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing 
reprisal said suspected collaborators were were amply warned and 
given a chance to repent they also noted that underground trials 
were conducted in which testimony was tape recorded 
sabah kanaan 32 said 10 palestinian activists their faces 
concealed by checkered headdresses broke into her home in the west 
bank city of nablus on april 21 beat her and sexually assaulted 
her she said in a telephone interview that they demanded 
information about an acquaintance they suspected of collaborating 
they stormed into my house carrying sticks and covering their 
faces they beat me and threatened to take my life if i did not 
cooperate and tell them said ms kanaan who was hospitalized in 
ramallah with bruises on the legs and arms 
this is the ugly face of the intefadeh said col renaan 
gissin the deputy army spokesman using the arabic word for 
uprising for some months now violence and intimidation have 
been used to enforce the policies and orders of the underground 
leadership 
the defense ministry report said frequent targets of threats 
were the 18000 palestinians who work for the armyrun civil 
administration which administers the west bank and gaza strip 
for example a threatening leaflet from the proplo united 
national leadership of the uprising forced the resignation of 450 
arab policemen especially after warnings were underlined by the 
killing of jericho policeman whose body was left on the doorstep of 
his house in march 1988 
israeliappointed mayors city council members and village 
leaders were also targeted three mukhtars traditional village 
leaders were assassinated in june 1988 and elbireh mayor hassan 
tawil was stabbed in the chest 
noting such attacks predated the uprising an army briefing 
paper said the plo always regarded the involvement of a local 
leadership in the territories of the west bank and gaza as a 
threat 
when bethlehem mayor elias freij proposed a ceasefire in the 
uprising in exchange for prisoner releases and the opening of 
universities spraypainted graffiti condemned him as a traitor 
and threatened him with death plo chairman yasser arafat warned 
anyone trying to stop the revolt exposes himself to the bullets 
of our people

using the bully pulpit of the white house 
president bush urged parents and stockholders thursday to demand 
that american companies act responsibly to prevent us 
chemicals from being used to produce cocaine 
no chemicals no cocaine bush told an international drug 
enforcement conference attended by delegates from 30 nations 
cocaine producers use ether acetone hydrochloric acid a 
chemical known as mek and other products to refine their drug from 
coca leaves 
few americans are aware that illegally diverted barrels of 
dangerous chemicals clearly marked with us corporate logos 
are routinely seized in the jungles of colombia bush said 
although bush referred in his speech to illegal diversions of 
chemicals justice department spokesman david runkel said us 
companies currently are free to sell all their products to other 
countries 
as a result of last years new drug law however federal 
regulations are being drafted that would require the companies to 
tell the drug enforcement agency of the ultimate destination and 
use of export shipments of seven products that could be used in 
making cocaine runkel said dea would have 15 days to review the 
paperwork and could stop shipments he said 
runkel said chemical companies have filed a stack of objections 
four inches high to the rules but that they were expected to be in 
place by may 15 anyway 
in washington the chemical manufacturers association issued a 
statement saying the industry is already at the front lines in 
the war against drugs 
the association which is made up of companies that manufacture 
industrial chemicals said the industry supported passage of last 
years antidrug law even before the law was passed the group 
said the industry was already working with law enforcement 
officials to identify and stop illegal shipments of our 
products 
association spokesman jeff van said his organizations 
objections center on deas attempts to take actions that congress 
rejected in previous legislation 
primarily he said the dea wants to require chemical companies 
to provide detailed reports on their regular customers while 
congress required only that they list the customers and the dea 
wants to force the chemical industry to provide statements 
certifying that the chemicals are being used lawfully a proposal 
which he said congress also has turned down 
bush made his comments in a speech on the final day of a hectic 
fourday trek visiting nine cities in six states from virginia to 
california and back 
although the trip was marred by scheduling problems and did not 
make much news nationally white house chief of staff john sununu 
said bush was satisfied 
he really feels its important for him to go out and let the 
folks see the president sununu said you just dont always 
focus on getting 15 or 30 seconds on the national news 
more than 100 eastern airlines strikers and their supporters 
demonstrated noisily against eastern chief frank lorenzo outside 
the miami hotel where bush spoke 
they waved signs with banlorenzo symbols chanted just say 
no and gave a thumbsdown salute to bush as his motorcade rode by 
bush who has refused to intervene to end the strike waved back 
at them 
bush told the drug conference that by and large the chemical 
industry has supported efforts to halt the flow of us chemicals 
weve been getting good support from most of the chemical 
industry 
however he said industrys got to do more 
and i hope that parents groups and stockholders are listening 
today we should demand that united states corporations act 
responsibly and that they not tolerate their chemicals ending up in 
criminal hands 
bush said he would like to see us chemical manufacturers 
demonstrate their courage and civic responsibility by entering into 
a true partnership with our government as we try to stop narcotics 
at the source 
these companies can make an important contribution to our 
nations fight against illegal drugs they should make it their job 
to join in 
sununu told reporters that the chemical companies deserve 
recognition for their voluntary efforts however he said 
theres no question that there are still some strange purchases 
of chemicals that take place 
asked if bush was suggesting complicity by some drug companies 
in the use of chemicals to refine cocaine sununu replied i 
dont think that was the suggestion at all its just a call for 
additional cooperation above and beyond the normal 
bush said the products used to produce cocaine are chemical 
time bombs 
in peru for example he said 175000 pounds of sulfuric acid 
are dumped each year into tributaries of the upper huallaga valley 
anyone concerned about the legacy of defoliation in southeast 
asia ought to go see what illegally diverted chemicals are 
beginning to do to the andes right now he said 
in the united states drug agents busted a houseboat lab on 
californias sacramento river that was dumping hydrochloric acid 
and other waste into water within splashing distance of children 
swimming bush said 
today i pledge to you that the united states will lead the 
fight against illicit shipments of precursor chemicals the 
president said 
he said drugproducing nations in latin america and 
drugconsuming nations chiefly the united states should stop 
blaming each other for the drug scourge 
ultimately the solution to the united states drug problem 
lies within our own borders steppedup enforcement education and 
treatment as well 
bush said that casual cocaine users can no longer claim 
noncombatant status in the war on drugs there is blood on 
their hands 
he said that realization has begun to sear the consciences of 
the stockbrokers and the students the lawyers and the homemakers 
and the athletes who finance our common enemy 
in a separate appearance in miami bush dedicated a hightech 
center run by the coast guard and customs service to spot drug 
traffickers in the air and at sea 
think of this as one of americas drug war situation rooms as 
our early warning network against narcotics bush said 
before returning to washington bush stopped in palm harbor in 
pinellas county to dedicate a 51bed care center at a retirement 
center for victims of alzheimers disease

military president augusto pinochets 
office said thursday he will name new ministers of education and 
mining but it indicated no plans to replace interior minister 
carlos caceres 
local press and radio had predicted caceres departure in a 
conflict with pinochet over proposed democratic reforms 
on wednesday gen pinochet asked all 15 members of his cabinet 
to hand in their resignations to give him freedom of action in 
making changes a spokesman said 
on thursday his press office said he accepted the resignations 
only of education minister juan guzman and mining minister pablo 
baraona 
according to local press reports that the government has not 
denied caceres and pinochet disagreed over the extent of proposed 
amendments to the 1980 constitution and other legal reforms sought 
by the opposition 
caceres has been negotiating the changes with civilian 
politicians and he said last week he is ready to make a firm 
proposal for the changes 
the reforms would include modifying a constitutional ban on 
marxism and altering congress and a powerful militarycontrolled 
national security council opposition parties are pressing for the 
reforms before scheduled dec 14 national elections to pick a 
successor to pinochet and a congress 
pinochet the army commander seized power in a 1973 coup he 
proposed in a referendum last october to remain in power until 
1997 voters rejected the proposal obliging him to call elections 
caceres was named interior minister the top political position 
in the cabinet shortly after the referendum 
patricio aylwin spokesman for an opposition coalition of 17 
parties said the retention of caceres is probably a good 
indication showing a willingness by the government to reach an 
agreement on constitutional changes 
andres allamand secretary general of the progoverment national 
renovation said pinochets decision to keep caceres guarantees 
that there will be substantial constitutional changes

the federal government on thursday raised the 
amount of grain the soviet union can purchase this year to 24 
million metric tons but a farm state congressman said soviet 
negotiators arent happy with the deal 
the soviets who previously had a limit of 20 million tons on 
the amount of us grain they could buy this year wanted to expand 
the amount to 30 million tons under the export enhancement program 
said rep david nagle diowa 
nagle who is a member of the house agriculture committee said 
us negotiators told the soviets they could not use the subsidy 
program 
attempts to contact soviet officials at their embassy in 
washington were unsuccessful 
kelly shipp press secretary to agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said the agreement does not stipulate whether the export 
enhancement program will be used during the sale she said the 
talks were about the amount of grain the soviets could buy not its 
price 
an agriculture department official told a senate subcommittee 
last week that eep sales had been put on hold pending a budget 
review an announcement that stirred controversy for the program 
the program is popular with foreign buyers because it makes us 
commodities cheaper it also helps the united states stay 
competitive with countries that heavily subsidize their exports 
but no eep applications have been processed since the end of 
february 
members of congress say they have tried unsuccessfully to find 
out whether the bush administration has suspended the program as 
part of negotiations in the uruguay round trade talks the us 
position at those talks is that all countries should remove or 
drastically reduce subsidies on their exports 
shipp yeutters spokeswoman said the program has been slowed 
down because of weather and stock conditions and because there is a 
new administration but it has not been suspended 
she noted that domestic wheat supplies are lower than they have 
been in 15 years and the eep program draws on those stocks

tawana brawley the black teenager who made 
national headlines after claiming she was abducted and raped by a 
gang of white men admitted to her boyfriend that she and her 
mother made up the story a newspaper reported thursday 
miss brawley made the admission two weeks ago to daryl t 
rodriguez 19 who became her boyfriend a few weeks before the 
alleged abduction in wappingers falls on nov 24 1987 when miss 
brawley was 15 new york newsday reported 
a grand jury concluded last year that miss brawley who was 
found in a plastic garbage bag smeared with feces and with racial 
epithets scrawled on her body had faked being raped 
the newsday story tends to corroborate everything that the 
grand jury discovered and the conclusions it reached said tim 
gilles speaking for state attorney general robert abrams the 
special prosecutor who handled the case 
gilles said that although there no longer was a question of 
criminal prosecution in the case the attorney general wanted to 
interview rodriguez to confirm the story because it would be in 
the public interest and satisfying to everyone to fill in some of 
the final pieces 
the story written by newsdays assistant managing editor les 
payne was denounced in a radio interview by two of miss brawleys 
advisers alton maddox and the rev al sharpton they accused the 
newspaper of trying to divert attention from what they called white 
establishment lies about the recent central park gang rape case 
miss brawley who lives in virginia beach va denied the 
account and said she hadnt seen rodriguez since last summer the 
newspaper said 
newsday said miss brawley told rodriguez that she and her 
mother glenda invented the story to keep ralph king her mothers 
lover from beating the girl 
sharpton and two lawyers maddox and c vernon mason kept miss 
brawley and her mother away from the grand jury while conducting a 
publicity campaign that depicted the state investigation as a 
coverup to protect the rapists among whom they alleged were a 
police officer and an assistant district attorney 
sharpton said the newsday story coming as the central park 
wilding rampage by black youths unfolds was meant to deflect 
the public from making comparisons between how the justice system 
responds to the rape of a black girl and the rape of a white 
woman 
maddox sounding the same theme in an interview on wlib said 
that so far there hasnt been any evidence of a rape or of this 
woman being assaulted or attacked at all in central park 
we dont even know if shes over at metropolitan hospital or 
not yet that is accepted as true while miss brawleys case is 
branded a hoax maddox said

the soviet union ended an era in its manned space 
program thursday when three cosmonauts returned to earth leaving 
the mir space station empty for the first time in more than two 
years 
a soyuz tm7 capsule carrying alexander volkov sergei krikalev 
and valery polyakov landed about 90 miles northeast of dzhezkazgan 
in soviet central asia tass said 
the suspension of the mir mission the showpiece of the soviet 
space program comes one day before the united states plans to 
launch its atlantis space shuttle with a crew of five 
mir designed for permanent occupancy will remain empty until 
another rocket launch scheduled in august officials said the 
respite will save money at a time when the soviet union is 
struggling with a 160 billion deficit 
tass called the touchdown of the soyuz capsule soft but volkov 
on the evening news program vremya called it not one of the 
softest 
there was a double touchdown the apparatus landed then 
jumped from the ground and we were turned over several times in 
general the blows could be felt probably the bruises will 
remain volkov said 
krikalev suffered the most because he hit a capsule control 
panel the tv reporter said without elaboration 
in the tv report krikalev appeared to be the most shaken and 
pale of the three cosmonauts and polyakov a doctor was shown 
treating him aboard a plane flight to star city near moscow 
there was no explanation what went wrong or why tass said the 
landing was soft 
volkov and krikalev had been in space for five months polyakov 
remained aboard mir for eight months after a joint afghansoviet 
flight to study the effects of longterm space flight on the crew 
a replacement crew was orginally due to arrive at the mir 
station april 19 to keep the station manned but tass said a 
delay with the preparation of the new modules forced a revision of 
the plan 
the respite will allow scientists a chance to review scientific 
data complete work on two unfinished station modules and give 
ground controllers vacations space officials said last week 
in august cosmonauts will return to mir for a sixmonth stint 
that will include overseeing the addition of a new research module 
and a service module officials said the additions will double the 
space stations weight to 100 tons tass said 
since its launch in 1986 mir has been home to four resident 
crews including the recordbreaking yearlong stay by cosmonauts 
vladimir titov and musa manarov who returned to earth in december 
cosmonaut vladimir gzhenebekov told soviet tv the landing 
required little corrections but there were no major problems 
like those that cropped up during the last two landings 
in september an afghan and soviet cosmonaut were forced to 
postpone the landing of their soyuz tm5 capsule in soviet central 
asia for a day because of equipment problems and crew errors they 
touched down safely a day late but were running dangerously low on 
food and air 
during the return of titov and manarov in december the 
cosmonauts had to spend an additional three hours orbiting earth in 
their descent module because of a computer problem the soviet 
media reported

the assassins bullet that killed us army 
col james nick rowe in the philippines passed through a 
softspot in his armored car the pentagon announced thursday 
spokesman dan howard told reporters that the slaying of rowe on 
his way to work in suburban manila last friday demonstrated the 
limits of the precautions the us military can take to protect its 
personnel overseas 
our bases in the philippines have had a heightened state of 
alert for over a year and a half now since three americans were 
shot outside of clark air force base said howard that alert 
status continues and of course the shooting has reemphasized the 
need for all of our people to be especially vigilant 
other than the heightened alert there is a limit to what can 
be done he said 
the car in which rowe was riding was armored he said but 
perhaps theres misunderstanding about what an armored vehicle 
is its an ordinary passenger automobile which has been 
provided with some types of protection it is not an m1a1 tank 
thick plexiglass is applied to the windows and armored plates 
are in the doors as well as extra shielding in the floor he said 
but it is not a completely secure conveyance he said and 
if someone fires armorpiercing rounds with an automatic weapon at 
the vehicle it can find a soft spot its not impervious to that 
sort of an attack 
in fact the bullet that killed rowe was not an armorpiercing 
round howard said the round bullet that entered the rowe 
vehicle went through what they call a nonhardened area around the 
window frame 
police in the philippines said hooded gunmen sprayed rowes car 
with an m16 rifle and a 45caliber pistol the communist new 
peoples army claimed responsibility for the slaying 
rowe 51 was chief of the ground forces of the joint us 
military advisory group which provides training and logistical 
support to the philippine military 
we use these armored vehicles all over the world at our 
embassies and the like military installations as do many many 
other governments howard said adding that there was no 
investigation under way to see whether the rowe vehicle was 
deficient 
howard said no special precautions were being taken in the 
philippines as a result of the slaying 
its been a general precaution area there he said the 
new peoples army has a long history of terrorist activity against 
citizens of the philippines they have occasionally turned their 
violence on foreigners 
we had three military personnel killed a year and a half ago 
there have been some other incidents one of which was the 
blowing up of some radio towers but theres no indication of a 
widespread campaign 
he said us officials have alerted americans in the 
philippines adding we have a great many people there 
howard said he didnt know whether special investigators had 
been sent from the united states on the case 
obviously this is sovereign territory of the philippines 
he said we are cooperating with the philippine authorities and 
we are pleased with the high level of cooperation that were 
getting trying to investigate the matter 
howard said rowe would be buried monday afternoon at arlington 
national cemetery across the potomac from washington dc 
following a private funeral in ft myer memorial chapel

an alleged assault on morton downey jr by 
neonazis did not happen as the tv talk show host reported it did 
and may be a fabrication authorities said thursday 
the facts certainly did not happen the way mr downey said 
they happened we cannot substantiate any of his claims either 
way said san francisco international airport spokesman ron 
wilson 
downey star of his confrontational shock tv talk show said 
he was attacked by skinheads in a restroom at the airport monday 
night he said they tried to shave his head and scribbled reversed 
swastikas on his face sweatshirt and pants 
since the initial report and downeys interviews with local 
reporters while still sporting the nazi insignias police have 
tried unsuccessfully to verify his story fueling speculation that 
the skinhead story was a publicity stunt 
theres just a lot of inconsistencies and apparently his 
story changes as time goes on wilson said asked if 
investigators determined the attack was faked he replied i 
dont want to make that flat statement it certainly leaves a 
lot of suspicions as far as im concerned 
jim langan a former producer writer and road manager for the 
morton downey jr show said in thursday editions of the record 
of hackensack nj that downey told him last month he would 
attempt a stunt to bolster sagging ratings 
he said he thought it would get him national attention said 
langan who left the show in december 
gary kessler a talk show host at kbxtv in denver said 
wednesday he spoke with downey on sunday about his trip to san 
francisco 
he said downey said he had been threatened by skinheads and the 
gay community and at one point he told me and im pretty sure 
this is a quote im a little concerned about what might happen at 
the airport 
asked about a possible publicity stunt show spokesman john 
murphy said i dont know i dont know anything there is no 
official comment right now 
san mateo county sheriffs sgt paul giguiere said that filing a 
false police report is a misdemeanor in california but he said 
downey declined police inquiries didnt want a report filed and 
refused to be examined 
investigators have been unable to find anyone to corroborate 
downeys story he said 
this indicates to me that there is a possibility it the 
attack was fabricated certainly guiguiere said if thats 
show biz you can have it 
the morton downey jr show formerly one of televisions 
most talkedabout programs has suffered a ratings collapse in 
recent months it ranks no 82 in the seasontodate syndicated 
television ratings 
in addition to the abcowned station in los angeles stations in 
san diego and phoenix have announced that they have canceled the 
show because of decreased ratings lack of advertiser support or 
consumer complaints 
the halfhour show which had its debut nationally last 
september features downey debating with and shouting at 
various instudio visitors

four house democrats on thursday called for 
the appointment of an outside counsel to investigate allegations 
that republican whip newt gingrich violated house rules in his 
financial dealings 
rep bill alexander dark filed a formal complaint with the 
house ethics committee earlier this month alleging 10 apparent rule 
violations in the formation and operation of a limited partnership 
set up to promote a 1984 book coauthored by gingrich 
but reps barney frank of massachusetts larry smith of florida 
pat schroeder of colorado and albert bustamante of texas are 
asking democratic colleagues to support their letter to the ethics 
panel chairman rep julian dixon dcalif calling for an outside 
counsel 
in the letter to dixon the democrats said such an appointment 
to investigate the charges against gingrich would preserve the 
integrity of the committees consideration process from 
politicization and outside pressure 
the committee has not indicated whether it will launch a formal 
investigation of alexanders complaint which was filed as the 
committee neared the end of the investigation gingrich initiated of 
house speaker jim wright 
gingrich earlier this week denied any wrongdoing in connection 
with the partnership and released nearly 400 pages of documents 
detailing its financial and incorporation history 
the partnership was formed with 5000 investments from 18 
individuals and three corporations many of the investors were 
wealthy republicans who regularly contributed to gingrichs 
campaigns in return for promoting the book the partnership was to 
have received half the publishers profits but the publisher lost 
money and the investors ended up with tax writeoffs 
earlier thursday gingrich used a national press club luncheon 
to outline the message of democratic corruption and republican 
opportunity that he has used to propel himself into the house gop 
leadership 
he said the gop must build a caring humanitarian reform 
party to offer voters an alternative to a democratic party that is 
committed to propping up a system thats dying 
every conservative in america must confront the reality that 
the great age of opposition conservatism is over he said 
goldwater and reagan won the argument and now the country wants 
us to govern we must come up with a wave of reforms of 
extraordinary scale 
gingrich who instigated the investigation that resulted in 
wrights being the first speaker ever charged with violating house 
rules said that america must undergo dramatic change to meet the 
challenges of the 1990s and that change must be focused on the 
system rather than on personalities 
i dont think any person in america can look at our 
competitive situation in the world market can look at the 
pressures of high technology can look at the rate of change in the 
soviet union and china and then turn to our major cities and not 
come to the conclusion that we are on the verge of absolutely 
catastrophic decay in the 1990s he said 
the reasons for that decay gingrich argued are drugs and 
violent crime the collapse of education systems in major cities 
the inability of unionized city bureaucracies to meet the needs of 
the urban poor the penetration of labor unions and city 
governments by organized crime and the democratic domination of 
congress 
gingrich said democrats have so insulated themselves on capitol 
hill that soviet provincial leaders were 16 times more likely to be 
defeated this year than were incumbent members of congress 
that is a fundamental insult to the constitutional freedoms of 
american and it is nothing more than a game written on capitol hill 
by a leftwing party that knows it cannot possibly survive in fair 
elections in this country and therefore they cheat every day he 
said 
as an example of such democratic cheating gingrich cited 
franking rules that he said permitted congress to spend more 
money last year on franked mail than every challenger for the house 
and senate spent on everything

finance minister michael wilson delivered a widely 
criticized federal budget to the house of commons on thursday and 
opposition members walked out to protest the leak of the budget to 
the media a day earlier 
the combination of a new 9 percent sales tax on most goods and 
services higher income and corporate taxes and spending cuts 
disappointed taxpayers labor organizations and business groups 
wilson released the budget late wednesday night after leaked 
details were broadcast by global television 
commons speaker john fraser went so far as to suspend the house 
of commons to decide whether to allow wilson to present his budget 
he later permitted wilson to present it despite protests from the 
opposition liberals and new democrats who said the finance 
minister had soiled parliamentary tradition by refusing to resign 
after the leak 
only one opposition member the reform partys deborah grey 
remained in the house for wilsons 10minute speech 
conservative prime minister brian mulroney defended his finance 
minister blaming an unidentified bureaucrat for the leak and said 
he would not accept his resignation 
wilson said the leak did not result from negligence or 
lack of proper security arrangements and its premature release 
appeared to have resulted from a breach of trust a willful 
criminal act 
the budget itself which has a 265 billion deficit did little 
to improve the stature of wilson a 51yearold toronto 
stockbroker within the canadian business community 
what a mockery is going to be made of us on the world stage 
said stephen wateridge of the bank of montreal the canadian 
chamber of commerce called it a disappointment and a lost 
opportunity for deficit reduction 
the budget called for increased taxes on cigarettes alcohol and 
gasoline as well as increases of 1 billion in corporate taxes and 
12 billion in personal taxes 
plans to develop a nuclearpowered submarine fleet will be 
shelved under a strategy to save 22 billion in defense spending 
over the next five years in addition 14 military bases across 
canada are to be closed or scaled down 
under the 67 billion submarine program the government was 
considering building 10 to 12 vessels according to designs 
purchased from france for its rubisamethysteclass boat or 
from britain for its trafalgarclass vessel 
the budget promises to cut the 265 billion deficit in half by 
199394 it drastically shrinks the proposed national childcare 
program about 19 billion in tax breaks for parents will remain 
but 34 billion costsharing proposal with the canadian provinces 
will be put on hold 
the leak resulted in the governments rushing out the budget and 
forced wilson to dismantle careful plans to release the budget in 
its most favorable light 
mulroney blamed an unidentified whistleblower who he said 
leaked the budget to a television reporter 
responding to calls for wilsons resignation he shouted across 
the floor to opponents you should be worried about the guy who 
stole the property 
liberal leader john turner sharply criticized wilson for not 
resigning he said the rights of every canadian had been violated 
because the leak might have been used for personal gain by those 
who had advance notice of the budget contents 
neither turner nor any other opposition member had any evidence 
that anyone gained from the budget leak 
new democrat leader ed broadbent said wilsons credibility is 
now completely shot and that the government should withdraw the 
budget and present another one later 
investigations were being conducted thursday into the 
possibility that people used the advance information in the budget 
to make profits on the stock market 
police were questioning anyone involved in printing the budget 
supply minister paul dick told the commons that every single 
individual among the more than 200 people involved in printing 
the budget had been cleared to handle secret material

an american elm tree president bush 
planted on the state capitol grounds amid great fanfare this week 
came with some uninvited guests tiny bugs a forester said could 
be destructive gypsy moth larvae 
bush who was guest of honor at a treeplanting ceremony monday 
afternoon brought along the elm which he said was a descendant of 
a tree president john quincy adams planted on the white house 
grounds 
paul blumhardt bismarck city forester reluctantly confirmed 
several tiny caterpillarlike bugs were picked off the tree after 
it was planted 
the tree wasnt unwrapped two minutes when we noticed it 
blumhardt said wednesday he believes the critters are gypsy moth 
larvae but tests to determine exactly what they are were not 
finished blumhardt said 
i dont think its worth causing embarrassment to the 
president the forester said hell say the next time im 
invited to north dakota to hell with them 
the ceremony was part of north dakotas celebration of its 100th 
anniversary of statehood officials hope to plant 100 million trees 
in the state by the year 2000 as part of the celebration 
the gypsy moth is common in the northeastern united states its 
larvae which can grow to more than 2 inches long defoliate trees 
by eating the leaves 
the bugs found on bushs elm tree were less than an eighth of an 
inch long so tiny a microscope was used to get a good look at 
them blumhardt said 
the forester said the visible bugs were picked off the tree and 
it was sprayed with an insecticide as was the truck the tree was 
transported in and the burlap in which it was wrapped 
in six or seven weeks monitoring traps will be set up around 
the tree to make sure there are not any adult gypsy moths around 
blumhardt said

despite shellfire still rocking beirut 
lebanons rival christian and moslem governments and syria declared 
support for the arab leagues call on thursday for a ceasefire to 
halt the sevenweek bloodbath 
their separate statements came as syrian and christian gunners 
dueled with mortars and rockets across beiruts dividing green line 
well after arab foreign ministers appealed at their meeting in 
tunis for a truce in lebanon 
one man was killed and two were wounded in the fighting which 
sent thousands of people scurrying for cover in basements and 
underground bomb shelters 
the christian cabinet under army commander gen michel aoun 
pledged to cooperate with a 312man observer force the arab league 
will send here to monitor the ceasefire called for noon friday 6 
am edt 
it is a modest step in the right direction to lift the syrian 
hegemony off lebanon said a statement issued by aouns threeman 
military cabinet after a latenight session 
the cabinet welcomed the arab league call to lift air land and 
sea blockades imposed in the latest round of lebanons 14yearold 
civil war 
it ordered that beirut international airport closed since march 
12 be reopened simultaenously with the ceasefire deadline 
the aoun cabinet also said it will ask the un security council 
to meet in new york to work out a mechanism to implement its 
resolution 425 which calls for israel to withdraw from a border 
strip it occupies in south lebanon 
rival acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a mainly 
moslem cabinet issued a statement in moslem west beirut pledging 
full cooperation with the arab league observer force 
in damascus the capital of syria the official syrian arab news 
agency said the government of president hafez assad was 
satisified with resolutions announced by the arab league on 
lebanon 
it quoted unidentified observers as saying the resolutions were 
tantamount to a slap to aoun and his isolationist zionist gang 
whether the carnage actually would stop after thursdays 
welcoming statements by the warring factions was another question 
three previous ceasefire calls by the arab league failed to halt 
the fighting 
the 22member arab leagues effort to end lebanons worst 
outbreak of violence in four years came at a twoday emergency 
meeting in the tunisian capital 
aouns 20000strong army has been locked since march 8 in 
ferocious fighting with an alliance of syrian troops and druse 
moslem militiamen 
by police count 273 people have been killed and 993 wounded in 
the clashes most of the victims have been civilians who fell in 
the indiscriminate shelling of population centers in and around the 
capital 
radio stations in the moslem and christian sectors of beirut 
interrupted regular programming thursday to broadcast the arab 
league resolutions 
aoun a maronite catholic has been insisting that the arab 
league make a direct reference to syrian involvement in the 
fighting instead of portraying the crisis as one between lebanese 
christains and moslems 
he also wants the league to pressure syria to withdraw an 
estimated 40000 troops stationed in moslem regions under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate 
the arab league final statement in tunis said an observer force 
to be commanded by a kuwaiti officer would deploy along the 
demarcation line between the battling factions keep points of 
passage open and identify the party responsible for any violation 
it said the league would make 3 million available immediately

the soviet academy of sciences passed a 
resolution last week declaring that the deaths of 20 demonstrators 
in soviet georgia constituted a criminal act that signaled 
danger to kremlin reforms a prominent soviet space scientist said 
thursday 
roald sagdeyev a soviet reformer elected last month to the 
newly created congress of peoples deputies released the text of 
the resolution here 
sagdeyev was one of three members of the soviet academy of 
sciences along with human rights activist andrei d sakharov and 
russian historian dmitri s likhachev who were elected to the 
congress and agreed to serve on a parliamentary investigating panel 
the tragic events in tbilisi capital of soviet georgia 
confirm the sad fact that perestroika is in danger said the 
resolution using the russian name for soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms 
special uniformed troops under the soviet interior ministry or 
mvd were responsible for using poisonous chemicals shovels and 
clubs to suppress the demonstrations in tbilisi on april 9 killing 
20 people the statement said 
this unusually cruel act has evoked the deep indignation and 
outrage of our entire society said the resolution which 
sagdeyev said was passed at a meeting of the entire academy of 
sciences april 21 
it completely contradicts the reform program is 
completely incompatible with the accepted moral and legal norms of 
a civilized government and must be seen as a criminal act against 
the people the resolution said 
sagdeyev said the events in tbilisi were especially troubling 
because it was the suppression of ethnic georgians by ethnic 
russian troops from the city of gorky in central russia 
ethnic russians form about half the 280 million population in 
the soviet union and their political power is far greater than the 
numbers would suggest 
much of the unrest that has gripped the soviet union since 
gorbachev rose to power four years ago has come from residents of 
the 14 nonrussian republics who like the georgians who 
demonstrated would like greater autonomy from russian rule 
the head of the communist party in georgia givi gumbaridze 
newly appointed after the april 9 deaths has confirmed reports 
that some of the demonstrators were killed by a toxic gas the 
exact nature of which has not been disclosed 
sagdeyev said it appeared final approval for using the mvd 
troops against the demonstrators came from local officials in 
georgia 
i do not think we should put all the blame on central 
authorities he said 
unrest in georgia took a violent turn in part because of young 
extremists among the demonstrators and in part because local 
communist party officials were out of step with the populace he 
said 
far larger demonstrations in the baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia by and large have not resulted in violence with 
the exception of a police crackdown in lithuania in september 1988 
that resulted in no deaths but led to the removal of the local 
party chief 
i think that there is much better understanding in the baltic 
republics between the communist authorities and the popular 
fronts which have been formed there he said 
sagdeyev said the paramilitary antiriot units involved in the 
georgian violence were formed under the mvd last july after the 
supreme soviet drafted legislation banning antisoviet 
demonstrations sagdeyev was one of 31 members of the supreme 
soviet or parliament who voted against the legislation when it was 
passed last october sagdeyev said he viewed the law as a threat to 
reform and would seek to have it repealed 
the antiperestroika forces are becoming stronger and more 
active than we would like to believe their main weapon is the 
concealment and distortion of truthful information said the 
academy of sciences resolution which was drafted in large part by 
sagdeyev 
gorbachev president of the soviet union and general secretary 
of the communist party consolidated his rule on tuesday by 
accepting the resignations of 74 aged voting members of the 
301member central committee 
those who resigned had lost the party or government jobs that 
had won them spots on the central committee and were viewed widely 
as potential threats to gorbachevs reform

contrary to widespread opinion physicians 
marriages are among the most stable in the united states according 
to a new study based on census data 
the proportion of physicians who were divorced in 1980 was 
significantly lower than the proportion of men and women in other 
occupations who were divorced said the study published in 
fridays journal of the american medical association 
but compulsive personality traits among physicians result in 
many having discordant and unhappy marriages even those that 
dont end in divorce suggests a report accompanying the study 
the report describes the marital problems observed among 320 
couples attending workshops for physicians and their families 
the study however said a review of scientific literature fails 
to support the belief that physicians marriages are poorer in 
quality than those of others 
many books and articles portray physicians as poor marriage 
partners due to what is described as a compulsive need to work long 
hours a need to feel allpowerful and inattentiveness to their 
spouses the authors wrote 
but no sound evidence exists that physicians have marriages of 
lower quality than other groups said the authors william j 
doherty of the university of minnesota at st paul and sandra k 
burge of the university of texas at san antonio 
the bulk of the large body of literature regarding physicians 
marriages while humanly interesting and challenging in its 
damaging portrait of medical marriages lack minimum scientific 
standards for drawing generalizations about physicians as a 
group the authors wrote 
the 1980 census data analyzed in their study involved a sample 
of 74822 male and 11462 female physicans the proportion of male 
physicians who were divorced was 43 per 1000 22 percent lower 
than the 55 per 1000 proportion for the rest of the employed male 
population the authors said 
the proportion of men divorced in other professional 
specialities was also 55 per 1000 and was 56 per 1000 for male 
lawyers and judges 
the proportion of female physicians who were divorced in 1980 
was 82 per 1000 23 percent lower than the 106 per 1000 for the 
rest of the employed female population 
females in other professional specialties had a significantly 
higher proportion 93 per 1000 who were divorced and the 
proportion of female physicians divorced was 35 percent lower than 
than the proportion 127 per 1000 of female lawyers and judges 
divorced the authors said 
the accompanying report said however that physicians 
marriages are often characterized by a strategy of 
postponement in which physicians continually put off 
participating in family life 
in coping with the demands of medical education and then 
practice itself physicians learn to postpone gratification 
commitment and intimacy said the authors dr glen o gabbard of 
the cf menninger memorial hospital and dr roy w menninger of 
the menninger foundation in topeka kan

in the amazon jungle a woman was killed and five people wounded 
when a column of procuban guerrillas raided a river town and held 
it for four hours the lima newspaper el comercio said thursday

amaru revolutionary movement stormed contamana on the ucayali 
river 390 miles northeast of lima late tuesday 
the interior ministry said it could not confirm the report

demanding that mine owners agree to negotiate all labor contracts 
jointly the union said 
it was not known how many of the nations estimated 70000 
miners joined the walkout

strike held two strikes over the same issue in the past year 
mining was paralyzed mining for three months and losses reached 
400 million onethird of the annual exports from perus most 
important industry 
but the walkouts failed to force private mine owners to accept 
the federation demand that labor contracts of mine unions be 
negotiated jointly rather than on the current companybycompany

a west german whom us authorities 
call the worlds top technobandit was sentenced thursday to 30 
additional months in federal prison and a 40100 fine in a daring 
illfated helicopter escape attempt from a federal prison 
werner bruchhausen 49 was given 30month concurrent sentences 
on both of two counts of conspiracy to escape in addition to the 
15year term imposed on bruchhausen for sales of classified 
technology to soviet bloc countries 
assistant us attorney steve dobson urged us district judge 
william stafford to exceed the sentencing guidelines for the 
attempted escape discounting the defense contention that 
bruchhausen was entrapped 
defense attorney bruce culpepper asked the judge to stay within 
the guidelines which called for a maximum sentence of 30 months 
he said no decision had been made on an appeal 
authorities foiled bruchhausens escape by setting up a us 
customs helicopter as the escape aircraft he had reportedly 
offered to pay up to 250000 for assistance 
bruchhausen was taken into custody by an fbi agent and four 
prison officers as he started toward the aircraft that swooped down 
over the softball field in the prison recreation yard last august 
bruchhausen began serving his 15year sentence for sales of 
classified technology at the tallahassee prison in may 1987 
bruchhausen and three others were indicted in august 1981 in los 
angeles on charges of conspiracy and violating the export 
administration act the arms export and control act and federal 
income tax laws 
the 60count indictment charged that from january 1977 through 
june 5 1980 bruchhausen and the others conspired to export from 
the united states various high technology commodities to east 
germany and elsewhere without export licenses from the state 
department and commerce department 
dubbed the technobandit by the us customs service he was 
arrested may 8 1985 in london extradited the following year and 
convicted of wire fraud in 1987 
bruchhausen allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment a computer system and other 
military and scientific items to the soviet bloc through dummy 
corporations in california and west germany

fourteen winning tickets were picked in 
the states record 115 million lottery jackpot a computer 
analysis showed thursday and two winners quickly were claimed by a 
group of ohio factory workers and a pennsylvania family 
the big jackpot was totaled at 11557898014 about 30 minutes 
after 14 workers from a windham ohio brick factory arrived to 
claim a share of it said jim scroggins lottery executive director 
people from washington pa and east windsor nj also 
claimed to hold winning tickets but did not arrive at lottery 
headquarters thursday 
i couldnt believe it i still dont said brick worker 
butch shavers 38 of warren ohio 
also arriving to claim a winning ticket were alverto handel 65 
of portage her son jim 39 of summer hill and her daughter 
nancy williams 34 of fort montgomery ny 
mrs williams said she got six of the winning numbers from a 
computerized palm reader at an openair bazaar when she and her 
husband were vacationing in midmarch in the bahamas 
i didnt believe in them mrs williams said of the palm 
reader i believe it was just luck 
mrs handel added the seventh number 24 based on the number of 
tickets they had purchased 
jim handel is a coal miner mrs williams is a library 
technician at the west point military academy and mrs handel is a 
retired house keeper 
mrs handel said the winning ticket was the first one that she 
checked after the numbers were drawn wednesday night 
i went down the line sinking my pencil in tears came to my 
eyes and i couldnt even look at the tickets mrs handel said 
scroggins said lottery officials would not be able to confirm 
the winning tickets until a second computer analysis is completed 
scroggins said each of the 14 jackpot tickets will be worth 
31752467 a year or more than 82 million paid out over 26 
years 
the workers from the harbisonwalker brick factory arrived at 
the lotterys headquarters in middletown outside harrisburg in a 
fourvehicle caravan setting off a wild dash by reporters and 
photographers as lottery officials tried to herd the potential 
winners into the office by a back door 
the workers said that they had bought 140 worth of tickets 
each of them contributed 10 to the pool 
scroggins said that it may take until early next week to 
validate the ticket presented by the workers in part because they 
do not have a signed legal agreement among themselves on how their 
share of the prize will be distributed 
in most cases scroggins said jackpot winners call the lottery 
first and are told of the necessity of having a lawyer draw up a 
dispersement agreement in this case he said the workers did not 
call 
they got excited and headed on down scroggins said 
in washington in western pennsylvania ed trapuzzano sr said 
his niece sylvia ann trapuzzano 34 was heading to lottery 
headquarters with what she believes is a winning ticket from 
wednesdays drawing 
however lottery officials said thursday afternoon they had not 
heard from the woman 
in east windsor nj jay rosen showed a reporter from new 
jersey network news a ticket that matched seven of the winning 
numbers drawn rosen said he owns the ticket with his parents a 
brother and a sister 
he said the family waited in line one hour too buy 80 worth of 
tickets 
a week of millionaire fantasies ended wednesday night with the 
drawing of the 11 super 7 numbers the numbers were 
0616243435374041456071 
smaller payouts for matching four five or six numbers will be 
determined by friday prizes for matching six numbers are usually 
several thousand dollars for five they are usually several hundred 
dollars and the prize for matching four numbers is 7 
lottery security was tightened last year after a bogus jackpot 
ticket was presented to lottery officials and a check was issued 
further checks revealed the ticket was fake prepared by a computer 
technician with access to the lottery system 
payment was stopped before the check was cashed and the 
technician and an accomplice who claimed the prize were prosecuted 
two lottery officials were reprimanded 
the validation process is not a twominute thing andersen 
said its more like two days there are extensive security 
provisions in place and they will all be followed 
the long lines at the states 3400 online lottery outlets were 
generally quieter thursday

us corporate takeover strategist t boone 
pickens jr saying hes offended by the treatment he received 
from a major japanese auto parts company served notice thursday he 
will pursue his claim to management rights in the company 
frankly i was offended by the brazen action of japans 
koito manufacturing co to question his ownership of the largest 
single block 202 percent of its stock in refusing him three 
seats on its board of directors earlier this month pickens told 
reporters at the washington foreign press center 
he also described it as frankly insulting to him as the 
largest stockholder to have to read in the newspapers rather than 
being told personally that his stock ownership was being challenged 
i not going to walk away from this issue and neither i 
believe is washington pickens said describing talks with us 
government leaders and members of congress 
the millionaire texas oilman said he is asking neither the us 
nor japanese government to bail me out of anything im in i can 
take care of myself 
but the reaction is very strong in both the administration and 
congress that something must be done as far as opening up 
japanese financial markets to equality for foreign buyers he added 
i dont think the japanese are going to be able to sit back 
and continue to pick and choose in our country what they want to 
buy what they want to invest in and want to own without having the 
same opportunities for americans in japan he said its that 
simple 
i dont think youre going to be able to do much about the 55 
billion trade deficit with the japanese unless you do something to 
open up markets 
pickens said he reported on his experiences in japan to japanese 
ambassador nobuo matsunaga in addition to us commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher trade representative carla hills other us 
officials and members of congress 
legislation already has been suggested to establish reciprocity 
in financial markets pickens said adding i wouldnt want to 
see anything foolish proposed and the best thing would be for 
the two countries to cooperate in opening markets 
i see the japanese pouring 15 billion into our country buying 
real estate and ranches other ownership theyre treated just 
exactly like other stockholders in this country but theres 
some reason were not wanted in japan reports from tokyo said a 
tenet of japanese business culture is that enterprises belong 
basically to their employees rather than stockholders 
i plan to attend the annual meeting of koito in japan june 29 
and will continue to assert my rights as a shareholder in fact 
the largest one in the company pickens said 
he said he purchased the 202 percent stock interest in koito on 
march 16 with the knowledge of the japanese finance ministry which 
cleared the purchase two weeks later 
the company carried out the stock transfer and after that it 
is not the managements business to question the intention or 
circumstances of purchase he said 
we dont have specific plans to change management or accuse 
them of anything other than i have reason to feel offended by the 
way they have treated their largest stockholder pickens 
continued we said we were not hostile we mean it we said were 
longterm we mean it we said we want to work with management and 
expand markets we mean it 
i was told you dont understand japanese customs i said 
maybe not customs but i understand ownership and we are your 
largest owner

a federal judge said his decision to 
release 4200 austrianmade rifles impounded as part of a bush 
administration ban on imported assault weapons still leaves a 
bigger question far from settled 
us district judge william acker jr said the rifles should be 
released to gun south inc of nearby trussville while the broader 
national debate continues to rage 
his ruling came wednesday in gun souths lawsuit apparently the 
first challenge of the administrations temporary ban on 
importation of semiautomatic rifles 
acker criticized the ban initiated by federal drug policy 
coordinator william bennett as obviously the product of a 
hurryup skull session if not a stampede reaction set off by 
bennett 
acker said the government must release 1200 steyr augsa rifles 
impounded by the us customs service at the birmingham airport 
and allow another 3000 to be sent to gun south from austria 
his ruling does not directly affect the moratorium on additional 
import permits for 29 other kinds of assault rifles until the 
administration decides whether they are used for legitimate 
sporting purposes 
but the judge criticized even that part of the policy 
contending the administration overstepped its bounds and interfered 
with congress right to enact laws 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said in washington the 
department was reviewing ackers decision and had yet to decide 
whether to appeal an appeal could delay delivery of the guns 
which sell from 900 to 1000 each 
i applaud the judges decision said james j baker federal 
affairs director of the national rifle association while attending 
an nra meeting in st louis 
at an april 6 hearing before acker a justice department 
attorney described the ban on assault weapons as a life and death 
matter but gun south argued that the us bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms approved import permits for the rifles before 
the ban was announced in late march 
gun south owner don wood testified that the ban could put him 
out of business 
semiautomatic weapons became an issue after reports of their use 
in druglinked killings and in the slaying of five children and the 
wounding of 30 others in a california schoolyard in january 
acker said the government offered no evidence that the steyr 
augsa failed to meet the hunting qualification contained in the 
ban 
to the contrary all of the evidence in this case demonstrates 
that the steyr aug is designed and marketed to be predominantly a 
sporting weapon the judge said 
he said that the only thing that has changed is an 
administration in washington and perhaps the perception of the 
proportion of the drug and gun crisis

the ninth victim of a serial killer apparently 
preying on prostitutes and drug users in the seaport of new bedford 
was identified thursday as a 25yearold new bedford woman with two 
sons 
sandra botelho was reported missing by her family last august 
and investigators said she probably was killed at that time her 
body was largely decomposed when highway workers discovered it 
monday in the brush along interstate 195 in marion 
martin said both the circumstances of botelhos disappearance 
and the location of her body were similar to the other eight 
victims all were women between the ages of 25 and 36 who lived in 
the new bedford area and had ties to that citys weld square a 
neighborhood known for prostitution and drug sales 
martin said botelho also had a history of drug use but he

the defense minister indicated thursday canada may 
have to ask the united states to help defend its arctic areas 
because a 67 billion plan to develop a nuclearpowered submarine 
fleet was left out of this years budget 
asked how canada could enforce its sovereignty claim over the 
arctic defense minister bill mcknight said i believe theres an 
opportunity through cooperation we may have to rely more on allies 
there are better was of defending northern sovereignty but 
unfortunately we cannot afford those ways mcknight said 
the united states has a large fleet of nuclearpowered 
submarines that have sailed under the polar ice cap provoking 
canadian protests 
only nuclearpowered submarines can patrol the waters under the 
polar ice cap reactors powering the subs allow them to stay under 
water for long periods without having to surface 
william rompkey of the opposition liberal party said it was 
incredible that canada might have to rely on the united states to 
defend canadian territory 
the whole point of the conservative policy was to show the 
americans that we are in there defending ourselves now theyve 
done a 180degree turn and said leave it to the americans he 
said 
since 1987 when the plan to build the submarines was announced 
conservative ministers insisted the submarines were essential to 
assert sovereignty in the arctic 
polls showed that 70 percent of canadians were opposed to buying 
nuclear submarines 
but mcknight said public opposition had nothing to do with the 
decision which he said was purely economic 
peace activists meanwhile praised the decision to shelve the 
nuclear submarine project 
it proves that organized sustained public opposition can 
indeed make a difference said ish theilheimer head of the peace 
group operation dismantle which gathered at its headquarters to 
celebrate 
john lamb director of a think tank called the canadian center 
for arms control and disarmament congratulated the government for 
scrapping the subs but said the decision shouldnt be viewed as a 
step toward unilateral disarmament 
the british and french firms that vied to sell their submarine 
designs to canada issued terse statements expressing disappointment 
at the decision 
richard sharpe editor of the authoritative defense publication 
janes fighting ships said the decision was a disappointment to 
nato and all those who believe it is necessary to be able to 
contain the soviet submarine threat 
he said canadas plan to buy either british trafalgar or french 
amethyste submarines would have been a major contribution towards 
natos antisubmarine warfare capability

committee for human rights and peace headed by nicaraguas former 
ambassador in washington carlos tunnerman 
the committee is to return its finding next wednesday for debate 
and a vote in the singlechamber assembly 
approval is virtually assured the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front controls the assembly with 61 deputies to 35 
deputies from six opposition parties 
the move seems aimed at creating a more democratic image for the 
leftist government of this central american country and comes as 
president daniel ortega tours europe seeking more money for 
economically distressed nicaragua 
some of the 10 european countries on ortegas itinerary have 
said more aid to nicaragua depends on government efforts toward 
democratization 
quant a nicaraguan citizen of taiwanese extraction was vice 
president of the nicaraguan chamber of commerce when he was 
arrested in september 1986 on charges of spying for the central 
intelligence agency 
he was accused of being recruited in 1983 and then providing 
economic information to the cia in a news conference at the time 
of his arrest quant admitted giving information to the cia saying 
he did it out of curiosity 
baldizon an official of the interior ministry was arrested on 
charges of being a cia spy and of complicity in treason after his 
brother lt alvaro jose baldizon defected on july 1 1985 
he was sentenced on july 22 1985 to 10 years in prison a 
spokeswoman at the interior ministry said thursday he was released 
from prison and placed under house arrest last march 17 
ms rivas then a government employee was sentenced to nine 
years in prison on jan 9 1985 on charges of belonging to the 
ussupported nicaraguan guerrillas known as contras the 
spokeswoman said ms rivas was allowed to leave prison in january 
and live with her family under house arrest

five central american presidents in el salvador last feburary 
ortega moved up the elections by 10 months and promised to 
institute democratic reforms here 
the bush administration has expressed doubts about ortegas

the soviet union releases 100 million 
tons of waste into the air and water each year but is working to 
clean up its pollution the leading soviet environmental official 
said thursday 
damage to our environment costs the soviet people at least 50 
billion rubles 80 billion each year said dr feodor f 
morgun chairman of the soviet commission on the environment 
he refused to say however if moscow was willing to join 
western countries in implementing a global ban on ozonedepleting 
chemicals by the year 2000 
morgun said his commission was recently established to 
consolidate the job of nine previous commissions and seven 
ministries some of which had vested interests in industry 
scientists and politicians were debating the question at 
meetings in helsinki finland the head of the un environment 
program said wednesday that disagreement with the soviets could 
block agreement to phase out chlorofluorocarbons which are blamed 
for depleting the earths ozone layer 
morgun was in stockholm for two days of talks with swedish 
officials he is to sign a swedishsoviet agreement on 
environmental issues friday 
his visit was timed to the third anniversary of the chernobyl 
nuclear plant explosion which played havoc with reindeer herds in 
northern scandinavia and sent fallout over much of europe 
he said chernobyl taught the soviets not to decide major 
projects without open discussion 
i would not want any other country to go through what we 
did he added 
in a talk at the royal swedish academy of engineering sciences 
morgun reported our country suffers a great deal from acid rain 
and 100 cities with more than 50 million inhabitants are the 
worst affected 
environmental problems are extremely grave in the ukraine and 
other southern parts of the country 
from now on industries which let out more waste than allowed 
will have to pay fines and these will be heavy he said he 
declined to give specifics 
the soviet union recently began cooperating with finland on how 
to curb pollution on the kola peninsula where acid rain from 
metals plants have caused acid rain and water pollution

strong usaustralian relations thursday and in particular praised 
australia for its military defense efforts 
quayle on his second day in australia flew here from canberra 
where he told a press conference the united states would like to 
see its friends in the pacific pick up more of the tab for defense 
at a time when washington is restraining its military budget but 
he praised australia for its efforts to enhance security 
australia has been a very very good partner in the alliance 
and has taken national security to its heart quayle said 
in melbourne he attended a blacktie dinner marking 
australianamerican friendship week an annual event to honor the 
allies joint effort in the battle of the coral sea in 1942 
noting that he was born in 1947 quayle said im the first 
vice president to be born after world war ii but in the 
tradition of the coral sea battle in which the allies repulsed the 
japanese quayle said the two countries must continue a 
relationship that is dedicated to keeping peace in this region 
he did mention one dispute between the two countries over us 
subsidies to wheat growers in an export enhancement program that 
the australians contend hurts their wheat sales in foreign markets 
quayle said he discussed the issue with prime minister bob hawke on 
wednesday 
believe me ive heard about our trade policy and export 
enhancement program in no uncertain terms not only from the 
prime minister but others quayle said 
it is still my belief that us trade policy is not hurting 
australia he said 
but hawke dismissed quayles arguments that subsidies had not 
hurt australias wheat exports 
the losses are not figments of the imagination they are cold 
hard and brutally hurtful statistics which have adversely affected 
our wheat farms he said 
quayle said the united states has made every effort to see 
that australian markets are not hurt when third countries are 
involved in grain trade 
the vice president said the subsidies are not designed to hurt 
australia instead his aides have said they are aimed at 
countering subsidies that the europeans place on their grain 
despite its own subsidy program quayle said the united states 
is dedicated to free trade 
our objective is to have free trade our objective is to 
knock down barriers 
meanwhile the congressional delegate to american samoa eni f 
faleomavaega criticized quayles twohour trip to that territory 
tuesday as a slap in the face to other island nations in the 
pacific 
the democratic delegate said us policymakers are insensitive 
to the unique economic structures and other problems facing such 
nations as western samoa tonga and vanuatu none of which is 
affiliated with the united states 
its time for different thinking in washington regarding the 
strategic region he said adding i give credit to the soviet 
union for their efforts to be friends with island countries 
during his twohour stop quayle called the american samoans 
happy campers participated in a traditional ceremony and 
declared a public holiday 
before leaving canberra quayle visited the tidbinbilla space 
tracking center a joint operation between the australians and

several came from broken homes and all lived in 
a neighborhood surrounded by drugs and crime but the youths 
accused of a savage gang rape of a central park jogger were 
unlikely attackers by some accounts 
i deal with kids in trouble these were not kids in trouble 
said bernard diamond principal of the junior high school two of 
the accused boys attended they come from homes of parents who 
care parents who are as shocked as we are 
the victim a 28yearold investment banker remained in a coma 
in critical condition thursday and was on a respirator after 
developing pneumonia 
eight of her alleged attackers ages 14 to 17 are in custody 
two were indicted wednesday and on thursday a grand jury indicted 
three more teenagers who allegedly left her for dead a fourth 
teenager was released without bail after a prosecutor told the 
judge the grand jury had taken no action in his case 
when asked afterward by reporters if his client had made a deal 
to testify or agreed to a plea bargain the teens defense attorney 
said no 
two other teenagers were indicted thursday on charges involving 
an earlier attack by the same group on a male jogger who eluded 
his assailants and reported the assault to park police 
the female victim was jogging alone in the northern end of the 
park later on the night of april 19 when she was attacked by a 
gang beaten unconscious with a pipe and heavy rock raped and left 
bound and naked on the ground 
when she was found four hours later her body temperature had 
fallen to 85 degrees and much of her brain activity had stopped 
doctors at metropolitan hospital say she may survive but its 
unlikely she will ever recover completely because of the injuries 
to her brain 
a cat scan will be done friday to find out if the womans brain 
swelling has gone down doctors said thursday 
by the end of the weekend we might have a clearer idea of 
whether the damage is substantial said robert s kurtz 
assistant chief of surgery at metropolitan hospital he said of 
patients injured this badly however stable we call them their 
life hangs by a thread 
police said only one of the suspects 17yearold michael 
brisco had a police record but friends said he was a frequent 
churchgoer who played drums for the choir 
tim burns a 15yearold schoolmate of suspect anton mccrary 
15 said hes a good kid he just followed the wrong crowd if 
youre in the wrong crowd this could happen to anybody you have 
to make your own decisions thats all 
lisa whitten of the national board of the association of black 
psychologists said the violence of city life allowed the boys to 
bury normal emotions in the frenzy of their attack 
theyre human beings who went berserk she said they had 
fantasies in their minds of being like those on television the 
ones who shoot people who are powerful in control macho 
aggressive strong 
the suspects were being held on charges of attempted murder 
rape and assault and could face other charges 
the woman apparently was one of several targets of the gang 
going wilding that night 
the term was new to police but not the activity for years 
loosely organized packs of marauding youths have roamed the streets 
and parks bullying robbing and attacking victims at random 
the assailants reportedly used racial epithets in one of eight 
assaults during the rampage and discussed getting whitey or 
getting a white jogger the victim is white and the accused 
attackers are black 
however lawenforcement experts say victims of the socalled 
wolf packs are more often black than white 
after their arrests brisco and kharey wise 16 were roughed up 
in an attack by several other inmates and yusef salaam 15 was 
attacked by another youth at the spofford juvenile center 
questions about the assault reached washington when a group of 
freshmen republican congressmen said thursday the incident pointed 
up the need for a tougher juvenile justice system 
what were saying is if youre going to do bigboy crime 
youre going to do bigboy time said rep chuck douglas rnh 
a former state supreme court justice he and fellow members of the 
republican research committee task force on crime said that from 
age 14 on youths who commit violent crimes such as rape armed 
robbery murder or attempted murder should be punished as adults 
central park has a reputation largely undeserved police and 
city officials say of being a dangerous place 
if this had happened in the streets it wouldnt be anything 
like this said eva haws who takes tourists on carriage rides 
through the park

president jose sarney announced on 
thursday night an emergency measure restricting the right to strike 
and imposing other curbs saying savage waves of strikes 
threaten to undermine democracy in financially distressed brazil 
i do not condemn legitimate strikes guaranteed by the 
constitution he said over national tv but i cannot tolerate 
the action of hoodlums who through violence occupy factories or 
armed demonstrators who throw bombs 
during his 10minute address sarney attacked political groups 
who do not accept the democratic game for what he called illegal 
strikes that paralyzed key economic sectors 
much of brazils economic woes stem from inflation 
sarney said his provisional measure the equivalent of a 
presidential decree goes into effect immediately and will force 
unions to maintain a emergency work force in essential sectors such 
as electricity communications hospitals transportation water 
fuel distribution ports and the central bank 
workers in basic industries and services will have to give 
48hour advance notice before walking out he said 
as a third limitation sarney said strikes now must be approved 
by onethird of the total union membership 
sarney brazils first civilian president after 21 years of 
military rule said the government will release more details friday 
congress has 30 days to approve or reject his action if it 
approves the provisional measure becomes law 
the president spoke as ports nationwide were idled for a second 
day union officials said by a strike of 80000 dock workers for 
higher pay 
no ships are being loaded or unloaded at any port in the 
country said jose dos santos a union official at the port of 
rio brazils secondlargest the strike does not affect oil 
shipments because the state oil monopoly petrobras has its own 
loading terminals and separately unionized employees 
workers want a standardized pay scale and a pay increase of 180 
percent to cope with inflation 
the right to strike for both public and private workers is 
guaranteed under brazils new constitution approved by congress 
last october 
but sarney cautioned thursday night when one goes beyond the 
limits of the law the road to force is opened 
he said 8790 strikes had been called during his four years in 
office including 1288 so far this year he said 70 percent were 
in the public sector 
i never imagined that among other attempts to undermine 
democracy there would be savage waves of strikes said sarney 
who took office in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by 
brazils top generals 
failure of the sarney government to curb 1000percentayear 
inflation has led to strikes that hit ports banks the auto 
industry and schools 
in january the government announced its fourth antiinflation 
program in three years to control wages and prices cut government 
spending and eliminate up to 90000 civil service jobs 
inflation fell from 288 percent a month in december to 3 
percent for 11 days in february but bounced back to 6 percent in 
march and was expected to wind up at 7 percent for april 
the government authorized pay increases of up to 18 percent in 
april unfroze some prices and created a system for 90day 
costofliving adjustments 
but labor groups estimated that workers buying power fell 49 
percent in the last year and threaten to call another general 
strike unless 50 percent pay raises are offered 
leftist labor unions organized a twoday national strike to 
protest the wage freeze the strike was only partially successful 
but strikes spread in april among teachers bank workers 
longshoremen and rio city police

george bush brought to the white house a 
cabinet steeped in washington experience but it is one of his 
outsiders samuel s skinner who has taken the most visible role 
100 days into his administration 
the transportation secretary has taken charge in major aviation 
and automobile issues but hes also emerged as the 
administrations point man in areas that stray into the territory 
of others in the bush cabinet the alaska oil spill the eastern 
airlines strike and fighting drugs and terrorism to name a few 
hes shown good instincts said norman ornstein scholar at 
the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank but 
ornstein questions how much staying power the former federal 
prosecutor and head of the chicago mass transit system will have 
bush also came into office with a pledge to hit the ground 
running yet many of his department secretaries have moved slowly 
in their new jobs 
all of them are somewhat limited by the defining 
characteristic of 1989 there aint no money said stephen hess 
senior fellow at the brookings institution a liberal think tank 
that financial reality of big deficits limits the initiatives 
available to any of the administrations domestic cabinet 
secretaries 
but even bushs seniormost cabinet member secretary of state 
james baker iii whose appointment was announced the day after 
bushs election has moved slowly in building a team and taking 
foreignpolicy initatives 
many of the departments are still without confirmed appointees 
in toplevel jobs with 49 nominations pending before the senate 
and more still to be made some of the independent agencies are 
hampered too the federal trade commission has no chairman and the 
consumer product safety commission doesnt have enough members for 
a quorum 
here is a brief look at the cabinet 
state baker is an old bush friend who ran his presidential 
campaign and is a veteran of the reagan administration he has 
concentrated on improving nato ties but also started negotiations 
in the middle east and worked out a deal with democrats in congress 
to permit nonlethal aid to the nicaraguan contras at least until 
the fall 
so tightly have baker and his closest aides held control that 
experienced diplomats have grumbled that they were being ignored 
defense dick cheney has taken charge forcefully at the 
pentagon and helped the administration put behind the debacle of 
john towers defeated nomination in a month on the job he has 
faced a budget agreement requring him to find 10 billion worth of 
cuts in next years budget he has moved to cut spending for the 
star wars nuclear defense ship building troop strength and 
the new stealth bomber and he has put together a combined mx and 
midgetman missile program 
transportation when the machinists union walked out on 
eastern bush named skinner to speak for the administration he 
rejected union appeals for the government to step in and while the 
strike drags on it has brought no major disruption in air traffic 
bush also had skinner whose department includes the coast 
guard oversee the cleanup of oil spilled by the tanker exxon 
valdez in alaskas prince william sound skinner also has pushed 
for tougher auto mileage standards 
labor elizabeth dole slipped into the background in the 
eastern strike although it was threatening to spread and she had 
the double qualification of being a former transportation 
secretary still she has led administration efforts in congress to 
limit a minimum wage increase and for its taxcredit child care 
proposal 
health and human services louis sullivan has kept a low 
profile after a bruising confirmation when he was attacked by 
abortion foes for remarks supporting a womens right to an 
abortion sullivan apologized and said he had misspoken since 
then the white house has nominated assistants that are known for 
antiabortion views 
justice dick thornburgh a reagan holdover is a moderate 
former governor who has moved rightward as attorney general 
becoming the administrations advocate for drug testing and 
overturning the supreme courts ruling that permits abortion 
treasury nicholas brady another of the reagan holdovers has 
won plaudits for tackling two of the toughest economic issues how 
to rescue the savings and loan industry and what to do about the 
third world debt crisis but hes come in for criticism in part 
because of public miscues as the administrations chief economic 
spokesman giving what seemed to be indifferent responses regarding 
problems of the deficit and inflation 
commerce robert mosbacher a texas oil millionaire and bush 
friend fought to protect us technology in the fsx fighter deal 
but he has not yet been elevated to the frontranks of economic 
decisionmaking 
housing and urban development jack kemp has drawn praise from 
all sides for bringing attention to homelessness and other urban 
ills and has attacked drugs in public housing by moving to ease 
evictions he also won administration backing for tax credits for 
urban enterprise zones but urban advocates are waiting to see 
money to go with his conservative war on poverty the question 
for kemp is can he meet the expectations he has raised 
interior manuel lujan was frozen out of initial decisions on 
the oil spill while skinner and epa chief william reilly 
dominated hes made public misstatements and been criticized as 
uninformed by environmentalists 
education lauro cavazos has been more conciliatory and less 
visible than his controversial predecessor william bennett but he 
has offered only a modest package of education initatives 
proposing spending that does not even keep up with inflation 
despite bushs campaign pledge to be the education president 
at the other posts james d watkins has yet to take a major 
initiative at energy and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has 
attacked foreign agriculture subsidies but also has been late in 
hiring his team at veterans affairs the newest department ed 
derwinski has been praised by veterans advocates for openness and 
for winning approval from the white house to ask congress for a 
small supplemental appropriation this year 
office of management and budget director richard darman has 
cabinetlevel status as does trade representative carla hills she 
has talked tough on the trade deficit but taken few real steps 
while darman was chief architect of the white house budget 
agreement with congress while it has been ridiculed as only 
papering over the problem it has allowed bush to keep his 
notaxincrease pledge 
drug policy chief bennett while pointedly not given cabinet 
status has drawn attention as if he had it raising gun control as 
an issue and winning at least a temporary ban on the importation of 
semiautomatic weapons

in a room with a view helena bonham carter 
plays a young heiress struggling against the repressive atmosphere 
of turnofthecentury england the actress felt equally confined 
maggie smith and daniel day lewis had the funny lines but i 
was on screen all the time she said i was the stooge in a 
way i wish i could have had the funny lines i felt deprived 
tired of portraying ever so nice often corseted girls 
carter begged for a chance to play minerva the promiscuous 
daughter of sir gordon munday in getting it right an english 
comedy 
they sent me a script because i have some sort of name she 
said but randal kleiser the director was somewhat doubtful i 
was right for the part and thought i wouldnt be able to do it 
carters persistence won out however and not only did the 
actress have fun with the character but the role of her father was 
filled at the last moment by sir john gielgud 
i bumped into him the first day and he said ive heard so 
much about you congratulations and i said congratulations on 
your career 
she remembered the great shakespearean actor as being very 
very shy and terribly modest there was great reverence on the set 
he would cringe with extra shyness because of everybodys sheer 
reverence he was very professional he was also very nervous and i 
was touched 
carter has become accustomed to working with experienced actors 
her film debut came in 1985 as the title character in lady 
jane in which she played opposite several members of the 
shakespeare company 
a room with a view had a highpowered cast including smith 
denholm elliott and julian sands besides geilgud getting it 
right features the veteran british actors lynn redgrave and peter 
cook 
stars dont exist as such in england carter said they 
are more actors who are revered theres much less said about their 
sex lives i think it has to do with the fact that theres not so 
much money involved 
carter had a chance to witness fame american style when she 
was a guest star in an episode of miami vice 
don johnson couldnt walk the streets i thought if this is 
what the star system does i prefer not to know about it alec 
guinness is very famous and he can go out and not get recognized 
she talked of her fondness for doing things out of context 
such as following a period piece such as a room with a view 
with a contemporary comedy even her decision to become an actress 
originated from a liking for the unexpected 
i was intensely shy as a child it was the last thing i 
expected to do stand up in front of an audience which is why i 
did it its extending yourself and exposing yourself to the 
extreme she said 
actors are considered egotists but on the whole its 
generosity youre giving of yourself 
but carter did not see acting as a fulltime profession even 
when she was chosen by director trevor nunn to play the teenage 
queen who was beheaded after nine days in lady jane 
he said get that girl she does look quite arresting he 
told me to learn the part in 48 hours i learned a speech from 
romeo and juliet and i had about one month of auditions and 
screen tests 
i was about to go to oxford and my life went into a completely 
different tangent it took me three years to realize that its not 
a tangent that its all connected 
the day after completing lady jane carter was contacted by 
director james ivory who along with producer ismail merchant was 
putting together the cast for a room with a view she felt 
relaxed in the interview with ivory still taking a casual approach 
to acting but tensed up once filming began 
i hated it she said i was learning it was a case of 
being asked to sprint before i could crawl i didnt give myself 
the license to fail i owe it very much to the people around me i 
didnt realize that i should let myself learn and make mistakes i 
was doing too much 
carter has gained an appreciation for the subtlety needed in 
film acting 
in the end you have to find one threadline its seeing the 
essence of things it might be just a walk or a bit of music and 
you think thats the person its the most economical way of 
revealing acting is about doing and the less you think it about 
the better

it is sometimes said that the stock market is 
slave to two masters interest rates and earnings but if thats 
so you cant tell it from todays market 
stocks react inversely to interest rates according to the 
saying but todays interest rates are higher than they used to be 
and so are stock prices shouldnt they be lower 
and according to the saying stocks anticipate earnings 
increases by rising months before the fact but stocks are up these 
days and anticipated earnings arent what they used to be is the 
market overpriced 
fundamental thinkers such as peter lynch of fidelitys magellan 
fund believe you cant foretell interest rates or the economy and 
that the only sensible thing to do is to buy into sound companies 
and hope for the best 
throw out all the theories you read and hear about say these 
basic thinkers because eventually the market will throw them out 
anyway it may be happening now they say 
nevertheless a very large percentage of the literature 
disseminated by brokerage houses is loaded with theories charts 
graphs analyses and forecasts of where interest rates and the 
economy are headed 
its the meat and potatoes of market analysis even if at the 
moment the practicioners are getting sick on their own diet 
one market analyst states that while a widely anticipated 
economic slowdown would have negative implications for corporate 
earnings todays stock market investors have yet to make this 
connection 
eventually he says they might 
but what about interest rates if there is a slowdown then 
interest rates probably would fall would the market then rise on 
the assumption that lower rates are good for stocks or would it 
fall in response to lower earnings 
the current situation is an oddity one of the reasons being 
that a weaker economy is widely viewed as good ordinarily a 
weaker economy is viewed negatively because it cuts into profits 
and throws people out of work 
todays economy however is believed to be close to capacity 
which is a dangerous thing without sufficient slack upward 
pressure on wages prices and interest rates is created a bit more 
slack some believe is called for 
the theory that the market is enslaved to rates and earnings 
therefore is suspended for the time being undeterred those who 
subscribe to it believe the theory will reassert itself before 
summer and fall in reaction to lessened expectations for corporate 
profits 
one of them drexel burnham lambert inc observes that prices 
may be ignoring the evidence that is beginning to unfold that 
while corporate profits might still achieve records this year the 
rate of increase is decelerating 
most published forecasts of corporate profits for 1990 it says 
are mere extrapolations of 1989 this it believes is unrealistic 
why says drexel there may be a recession in 1990 and if this 
occurs we estimate that profits will fall roughly 20 percent next 
year 
will profits fall will investors make the connection will the 
market roam free or will it become enslaved by that other part of 
the saying that lower interest rates are good for stocks 
what the market really seems to be saying is that it is slave to 
nothing but the hopes and expectations of investors if you feed 
the market more money then prices will rise and if you take money 
away it will shrivel 
now thats a maxim you can believe in

the jail in this windswept provincial 
capital is empty except for a rusting bicycle stored in one cell 
and potted plants in the other 
there are crimes here but only small crimes said sgt 
clementi cantor chief of the twoman police force in basco 
capital of batanes the forgotten province of the philippines 
this year sgt cantor has investigated three crimes 
domestic disputes and fights between neighbors none was serious 
enough for the courts 
only 23 crimes were reported in the entire province last year 
the most serious a murder committed by a soldier was the first 
killing reported in 20 years 
weve had judges come to hear cases and they say its like a 
vacation in the bahamas said tess castillejos executive 
secretary to the mayor 
the low crime rate is one of many features that make batanes 
the smallest most northerly and least developed province unique 
in the violenceplagued philippines 
its 15000 people known as ivatans live in quiet isolation 
they fish and raise crops and cattle on 10 small islands about 250 
miles north of manila and only 140 miles south of taiwan 
few outsiders venture to batanes whose lush green fields 
mistshrouded hills and villages on rocky cliffs make it look more 
like the welsh coast than the tropics 
telephones forget it the radiotelephone link was cut last 
year when communist rebels blew up a relay station on luzon the 
main philippine island 
batanes is not perfect 
it has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the 
philippines per capita income is only 416 pesos 1980 a month 
so many of the brightest youngsters leave after high school in 
search of opportunity 
we need government investments in cattle fishing garlic and 
root crops and to improve the seaport so our young people can find 
jobs here said the provincial governor telesforo castillejos 
most provinces have an overpopulation problem but our growth 
has been almost nill because of emigration 
typhoons and and other storms batter the islands frequently and 
ivatans live in square fortresslike stone houses for protection 
from them but there are no communist rebels no armed gangs and no 
beggars 
internal combustion engines do not pollute the air in basco a 
town of 6000 people all batanes has only 120 motor vehicles and 
twothirds are motorcycles 
if roosters crowing can be called noise pollution it is the 
most common form 
lt col jesus poblete provincial military commander said i 
dont feel very busy here 
his major challenge is the occasional taiwanese fishing vessel 
encroaching on philippine waters otherwise he said all we do 
is run train and have meetings i dont have much to do 
i think its the perpetual serenity which we dont find in the 
metropolitan areas that keeps people here said tess castillejos 
an inlaw of the governor and native of batanes who returned with 
her husband after several years in manila 
in manila i spent the whole day taking my children to and 
from school and driving to stores here i kiss them in the morning 
and they come home in the afternoon i can walk everywhere 
because of frequent storms in the balintang channel commercial 
ships do not run regular services between batanes and luzon 140 
miles to the south 
most supplies come on lst landing craft which the philippine 
navy uses extensively for interisland traffic 
they reach batanes about every three months one ran aground in 
the harbor during a storm last year and its hulk is still there 
quietly rusting 
philippine air lines provides the main link with the world a 
daily flight often canceled because of bad weather 
a siren heralds the planes arrival and scores of townspeople 
usually go to meet it since the airport is within walking distance 
of downtown basco 
there is no television and residents can pick up philippine 
state radio for only a few hours a day on a relay from tuguegarao 
200 miles south 
that hardly matters because only a few hundred homes in basco 
can receive the parttime electricity when the juice comes on for 
four hours each evening residents flock to makeshift theaters 
where local entrepreneurs show movies at 5 pesos 25 cents a head 
those who have seen the available movies watch or participate in 
pickup basketball games in the town square until the electricity 
goes off 
fishing swimming biking thats about all the recreation 
here said aniano bata 45 a lifelong resident its good 
clean fun

when rogaine was unveiled last september 
by the upjohn co as the first scientifically proven hairloss 
remedy financial analysts envisioned desperate balding men running 
to doctors for prescriptions 
today those analysts and many consumers are disappointed and 
upjohn is preparing a new more aggressive marketing campaign aimed 
at men whose embarrassment at seeking help for their hair loss may 
have prevented them from trying the drug 
upjohn says it is pleased with rogaines performance and blames 
drugindustry analysts some of whom predicted 1989 us sales 
would top 300 million for unrealistic expectations 
any new product that saw the sales that rogaine did in the 
first few months would be deemed an outstanding success said 
upjohn spokeswoman kaye bennett we expected to succeed in the 
long run while the analysts thought it would be a runaway 
success 
disappointed consumers also may have set unrealistic 
expectations by ignoring upjohns warnings that rogaine wouldnt 
work for most men 
though upjohn does not release sales figures for specific 
products drug industry analyst ronald nordmann of painewebber inc 
estimated domestic sales for rogaine accounted for 11 million of 
the kalamazoobased companys 755 million in net sales for the 
first three months of 1989 
while rogaines sales were more than double those for the fourth 
quarter of 1988 nordmann said he interpreted the figures as 
disappointing 
the product has certainly been slow out of the starting 
gate he said 
there are many reasons for rogaines sluggish sales researchers 
and hairloss specialists say among them 
upjohns 8monthold 20 million advertising campaign 
featuring a man walking along a beach with the see your doctor 
phrase may have been too lowkey and vague 
the price about 50 for a onemonth supply and the necessary 
lifelong commitment to its use 
once you stop using rogaine any hair you may have grown back 
will fall out if the drug has stopped your hair loss youll make 
up for lost time as soon as you quit 
most baffling however is that companies featuring bogus 
baldness remedies on latenight television continue to outsell 
rogaine by a ratio of about 10to1 said mike mahoney president 
of the american hair loss council 
the biggest deterrent to rogaine is that the man has to go to 
his doctor and admit that he is not comfortable with his hair loss 
with the others he can call a 1800 number from the privacy of his 
own home said mahoney whose nonprofit organization provides 
consumer information on hairloss treatments 
upjohns new marketing campaign beginning in midmay will 
feature a tollfree number the consumer will be connected with a 
haircare specialist to discuss rogaine and then will receive 
information on rogaine via mail 
like the previous ads upjohn still wont refer to the drug by 
name us food and drug administration regulations prohibit 
companies from advertising prescription drugs by name unless there 
also is a full disclosure of any warnings and potential side 
effects 
the company has released few details about its new marketing 
strategy but says its designed to identify and target the market 
for the drug which was approved by the fda last august 
though analysts see the new campaign as upjohns reaction to 
slow sales the company insists the more aggressive campaign always 
was part of its marketing strategy 
some of the blame for disappointment with rogaines results also 
lies with the consumer who may have been expecting too much 
upjohn warned consumers from the start that the tonic wouldnt work 
at all for most men 
rogaine the trade name for a substance called minoxidil is 
recommended for men younger than 40 who have been losing hair for 
10 years or less and who have an area of baldness 4 inches in 
diameter or less on the crown of the head 
clinical trials showed about 39 percent of men suffering from 
malepattern baldness will either grow some new hair back or stop 
losing hair after six to eight months on the drug 
if youre going to use this stuff youve got to be patient 
and use it for a year said dr david whiting medical director 
of the baylor university hair research and treatment center in 
dallas texas otherwise youll never know if it would have 
worked 
bert camp a railroad engineer in mineola texas saw results 
after about three months on rogaine 
since i started using it ive definitely seen some new hair 
growing said camp 46 and for 10 years ive been using 
everything that i could get my hands on to stop hair loss 
still camp said rogaine was too expensive especially since 
im going to have to use it for the next 20 or 30 years 
at the 2270store rite aid pharmacy chain in harrisburg pa 
spokeswoman suzanne mead said rogaine sales had been slower than 
expected 
rogaine may almost double its market if the fda approves it for 
use by women of the 50 million americans losing their hair 20 
million are women and clinical trials have found the drug to be 
slightly more effective on women bennett said 
upjohn also is working on advanced application methods for the 
alcoholbased solution which tends to be messy to apply as well 
as teaming up with procter amp gamble co on new ingredients designed 
to increase efficacy and create new minoxidil products such as a 
cream

president bush charting a new course for 
relations with congress is taking lawmakers on a 100day honeymoon 
of classic proportions and usually feisty democrats are declaring 
themselves delighted 
what bush is trying to do is restore the trust that needs to 
exist between the congress and the white house in order to get 
things done says house democratic whip tony coelho dcalif a 
fierce partisan when he wants to be but mellow toward the president 
these days 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash says that after 
what was clearly from our perspective a very harsh and negative 
campaign i think the president immediately offered an approach of 
cooperation and conciliation 
i think hes doing very well says foley 
in his first 100 days bush has not only erased most if not all 
of the bitterness among lawmakers resulting from the campaign but 
administered salve to a congress shellshocked after eight years of 
combat with ronald reagan 
still bush took a hard political beating in the early going as 
the senate rejected john tower for secretary of defense lawmakers 
say the problem was primarily friction between tower and senate 
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dtexas 
bush made a swift recovery and won quick confirmation for his 
second nominee for the pentagon post dick cheney but hes headed 
for another showdown with congress over the minimum wage 
and not all democrats are buying off on the political nostalgia 
trip back to the era of good feeling when presidents almost always 
had a 100day honeymoon with congress there is no certainty that 
the mood will last says senate democratic whip alan cranston 
dcalif its too soon to tell 
all the same hes not an arm twister says cranston he 
reasons 
bush compromised with lawmakers on the major issues of central 
america and the budget i think the work weve done these past 
three months demonstrates the value of tough principled 
negotiation bush told the annual meeting of the associated press 
on april 24 
the new president who was a member of the house of 
representatives from 19671970 also has gone to work on 
congressional egos earlier this month he summoned a bipartisan 
group of lawmakers to the cabinet room for an openended session 
also attended by secretary of state james a baker white house 
chief of staff john sununu and budget director richard darman 
the president said i promised consultation and were going 
to consult says rep henry j hyde rill the president 
said i am concerned about the erosion of presidential authority 
and i realize that if presidential authority is to be reinforced 
there must be consultation 
skeptics hold that the new climate has been simple enough to 
engineer given the lack of hard choices thus far the budget 
compromise envisions meeting the 100 billion deficit ceiling for 
fiscal 1990 prescribed by the grammrudman law but relies on 
projections such as 54 billion in new revenue that have fiscal 
experts squinting doubtfully 
many conservatives signed off on bushs compromise plan to send 
90 million more in nonlethal aid to contra rebels opposed to 
nicaraguas sandinista government resigned to a firm anticontra 
majority on capitol hill they say it was the best the president 
could have hoped for but they still smoulder quietly at a 
provision that will allow congressional leaders to shortcircuit 
the aid next fall if they are dissatisfied with the situation 
the one issue where bush and congress appear to be on a headon 
collision course is the minimum wage the president is threatening 
to a veto of an increase approved by the senate indeed the white 
house almost seemed to seize on the conflict as proof that 
oldfashioned headbutting politics are not extinct in washington 
i dont know what hes building up all this good will for 
chortles rep barney frank dmass when substance comes up 
people arent going to go into the tank for you just because 
youre a nice guy 
conservatives wonder if bush might not be just a little too 
affable for his own good its conceivable that bush starts out 
with this modest beginning and then really goes to town says 
patrick mcguigan a fellow of the free congress foundation but 
thats not the normal pattern of presidencies 
politics says mcguigan is about many things 
negotiation necessary compromises governing but at its bottom 
line politics is about confrontation and disagreement where is 
that agenda forcing confrontational votes in the congress of the 
united states its not there 
more pragmatic republicans scoff at that notion bush they 
note was not swept in amid clarion calls for a sweeping overhaul 
of the system 
george bush did not come in what that same mandate that 
reagan had reflects former white house communications director tom 
griscom this is not a time of confrontation were now trying to 
improve what is already there 
what is legislation except compromise says washington 
lobbyist tom korologos a former chief of white house congressional 
relations he sees the bush style as the normal product of the 
presidents career as a professional insider adept in his knowledge 
of the ropes and levers of government 
even a few democrats however wonder if bush may not be missing 
an opportunity to whisk through a few favorite programs before the 
honeymoon ends 
if there was anything on the bush agenda this was the time to 
do it says political consultant gregg schneiders a former 
adviser to the carter white house he sees a fat and happy america 
that cares little about capitol hill conflicts theyre not 
looking for a lot of activism and his style tends to fit in with 
the public mood 
its not absolutely necessary says horace busby one of the 
inner circle in johnson white house to make a big show of muscle 
and chutzpah and macho he just has to show that hes not weak 
that represents a change in american politics that busby traces 
in part to the decline and virtual disappearance of tension and 
potential conflict between the united states and the soviet union 
theres nothing to have a crisis about and so congress convenes 
and goes about its business wheres his vision wheres his 
plan he doesnt have to have one 
none of this will hurt much as long as the conditions that 
elected him continue to prevail says georgetown university 
political scientist michael robinson the country doesnt 
much care whether he has an agenda or whether he has a philosophy 
or whether hes a toady or whether he tries to stand up to 
congress 
almost everyone agrees that a hard political rain would be 
guaranteed to fall if there were a recession for the moment 
though the sun is shining and both sides instead are reveling in 
the fellowship 
all i know says republican hyde glancing across the aisle 
to the democratic side is that reagan was the hated enemy the 
usurper he didnt belong there the attitude toward bush is that 
he belongs there that he elevates the debate and the level of 
discourse considerably

probably few americans believe mexico or 
canada are likely to invade sparsely populated areas of texas or 
north dakota when children of longtime farm families decide to 
head for the bright lights of the big cities 
but two agriculture department analysts say this fear is part of 
a territorial imperative that is a reason for some european 
countries viewing the migration of people from farming areas as a 
threat to national existence 
as a result they say these countries spend lots of money and 
take extraordinary steps to keep people on the farms as long as 
possible 
ken deavers and dick long of the departments economic research 
service say the united states and western europe have a number of 
common goals as they seek government policies that will enhance 
rural development 
in spite of agricultures shrinking share of employment and a 
corresponding decrease in its share of total economic output 
agricultural policy is as difficult to disentangle from rural 
development policy in europe as it is in the united states 
deavers said agricultural and rural wellbeing are as closely 
identified in the popular mind and political processes of europe as 
they are in the united states 
therefore he said governments continue to spend huge amounts 
of money on farm programs because they are uncertain about other 
intervention strategies to hold population in rural areas 
however in spite of their popular appeal farm programs do 
little to accomplish that goal deavers said 
deavers an economist and long a political scientist said in 
the may issue of farmline magazine that americans might recognize 
the situation in europe as similar to their own 
here despite recordhigh government ayments to farmers and 
recordhigh farm income in the middle 1980s farmdependent rural 
communities continue to lose population to metropolitan areas at or 
near record rates deavers said 
but the reasons behind the heavy spending on farm programs vary 
tremendously between the united states and the european economic 
community for example 
deavers described territorial imperative as the commitment to a 
form of economic development that allows people to continue to live 
in the countryside if they choose and still maintain a living 
standard at least close to the national average 
the territorial imperative takes forms in europe that are 
unfamiliar to americans he said europeans are concerned with 
the ecological consequences of depopulation what they call 
desertification europe has been more densely settled than the 
united states for over a thousand years and in this european view 
much of the territory must be maintained by man in order to protect 
the ecology the natural and social environments and the beauty of 
the countryside 
deavers added territorial concerns manifest themselves in 
some european countries especially in the lesspopulated north as 
important to national defense the need to have people in remote 
areas to assure that a potential enemy does not encroach unobserved 
on the borders 
in the united states he said territorial imperative is less 
tied to the maintenance of the countryside and more to the economic 
viability of rural communities and the plight of those who must 
move to make a living 
deavers said that when people move from rural areas of the 
united states those left behind see it as a threat to their way of 
life parents are distressed by the prospect of separation from 
their children and granchildren and elected officials see their 
constituencies and electoral bases eroding he said 
politicians have deplored the loss of people from us rural 
areas but legislation creating rural development programs has 
rarely corresponded to the rhetoric he said there are no 
programs specifically helping only places experiencing 
outmigration 
for example he said laws creating the economic development 
administration in the commerce department did not specifically 
direct its assistance at such areas 
nor did the laws creating any of the farmers home 
administration rural development programs deavers added our 
basic agricultural policies have supported the mechanization and 
consolidation of farming facilitating the rapid loss of farm 
population and the decline of many farming communities 
between 1950 and 1985 he said the us farm population 
declined by an estimated 177 million people 
nevertheless until the emergence of serious urban stresses in 
the 1960s especially the riots of that decade there was 
surprisingly little talk about outmigration or rural depopulation 
as a major problem deavers said 
in europe meanwhile leaders have matched the rhetoric and have 
added new programs that are designed to keep the rural population 
in place 
long the political scientist that if anything western 
european leaders and governments are even more articulate about 
the territorial imperative 
for example he said the 21nation council of europe recently 
conducted a campaign for the countryside which included a 
focus on disadvantaged rural areas threatened by depopulation 
economic decline and a diminishing quality of life 
rural problems sometimes permeate european politics reflecting 
agricultures comparatively great political muscle long said 
one reason for such strength is a version of syndicalism practiced 
in in many european countries which gives quasiofficial status to 
various organizations of tradesmen producers and craftsmen 
in the case of agriculture long said one farmers organization 
in france for example is designated as the official 
representative for all farmers in that country 
the practice in the united states is for each farm and commodity 
organization to speak for itself although various coalitions have 
been formed from time to time as issues develop

one hundred days later president bush is 
doing just about what he said he was going to do changing things 
slowly operating methodically nothing drastic little drama 
that is the approach he described before the inauguration and 
the one he defends now im a practical man bush said the 
other day i like whats real im not much for the airy and the 
abstract and i like what works 
whether the bush method is working or not depends on who is 
judging early on the president found it necessary to deny that 
his administration was drifting without clear purpose beset by 
malaise the dread political affliction diagnosed during jimmy 
carters oneterm presidency there remain suggestions that bush 
has described no clear purpose and that his own identity remains 
indistinct illdefined 
that doesnt seem to be bothering most americans the public 
opinion polls show solid approval ratings for the way he is doing 
his job a usa today poll indicated that 56 percent would rather 
have him as president than ronald reagan 
reagan came to office with a clear mission and agenda rein in 
government and cut taxes those goals overrode everything else 
during his first months in office 
bush had no such program and said so before he took office 
youre looking for a dramatic twopoint program or 
something he told an interviewer asking about his agenda for the 
first 100 days we dont need a twopoint program 
we need to correct one big problem and we need to build on 
some tremendous successes and we need to capitalize on changes in 
the world the problem was the budget deficit its still the 
problem despite a white house deal with congress to produce a 
holdingaction budget this year 
thats at least the approach im going to bring to the job 
bush said in january 
and now 
i do not feel compelled or pressed because of a column here or 
a column there to reach out for something dramatic 
but bush and his advisers did feel the need for a 
campaignpaced sixstate swing this week to say and show that a 
lack of drama does not mean a lack of action 
my starting point has been a respect for american institutions 
for congress for the dedicated civil servants of the executive 
branch for state and local governments for the concept of public 
service the president told annual luncheon of the associated 
press in chicago on monday the emphasis is on cooperation 
not confrontation as the surest route to progress 
this has meant compromise on some points on which reagan 
wouldnt budge but that fits the bush premise that federal 
government can and should help solve problems reagan maintained 
that government usually was the problem not the cure 
bush said before taking office that the voters didnt elect him 
to bring drastic change to government thats not what i am 
about he said people understood that when they were voting 
they werent looking for a radical shift 
there have been shifts but most have come gradually on 
selected issues not as part of any grand design that leads back 
to the question of whether there is a grand design for the bush 
presidency none shows yet but bush has had only three months of 
the 48 in this term 
theres a long road ahead of us he said and i am 
optimistic that our reforms will produce lasting results that 
the longrange planning we do today will pay off in the future 
that our consultations with congress will result in progress in 
domestic and international affairs as well 
his success in reaching those goals will determine which 
historical parallel comes closest to fitting his first hundred days 
in us history the phase recalls the 1933 special session of 
congress in which president franklin d roosevelt won swift 
approval of his proposals to deal with the depression in france 
it applies to napoleons escape from exile and the brief final 
campaign that ended in his defeat at waterloo

the federal trade commission is investigating 
certain business practices of benetton group spa focusing on the 
companys relationships with owners of us benetton boutiques 
according to the italian apparel maker 
the company said the ftcs new york office is conducting a 
preliminary probe trying to determine whether benetton is a 
franchisor that should have complied with federal franchise rules 
benetton made the disclosure in a recently published prospectus 
for a proposed offering of 8 million american depositary shares a 
spokesman for the company wednesday declined to answer questions 
about the investigation 
the document stated although many of these matters are in a 
preliminary stage the company does not believe that their outcome 
will have a material adverse effect on the company 
at ftc headquarters in washington spokeswoman susan ticknor 
said she could not confirm or deny whether there is an 
investigation in progress into the benetton matter 
the clothing company said in the prospectus that a number of 
us store owners have alleged in bankruptcy court proceedings that 
benetton has engaged in unfair trade practices and violated 
certain franchise and other statutes 
federal law requires franchisors to make detailed disclosures 
before selling a franchise franchisors must obey various federal 
laws intended to protect business owners from abusive practices 
some states also have statutes that apply specifically to 
franchisors 
the company markets its clothing for women men and children 
through independently owned benetton retail stores there are about 
700 benetton stores in the united states and the company does not 
consider itself to have a franchise relationship with the owners 
about 70 independent sales representatives are used to cultivate 
the development of stores for benetton products in 79 countries 
these representatives find investors and store operators to 
finance own and manage the retail outlets they handle the 
placement of orders to benetton and monitor the stores in their 
territories 
store owners buy merchandise from benetton and set their own 
prices but they do not pay benetton a fee for use of its trade 
names nor do they pay any royalties based on a percentage of sales 
or profits as is frequently the case for franchisees 
benetton operations in the united states in 1987 and 1988 were 
hurt by a downturn in womens apparel sales and a decline of the 
dollar against the lira us sales were virtually flat last year 
while operating margins shrunk 
the timing of these factors was particularly bad because they 
occured after a period of rapid growth in the number of stores in 
the united states some of which were opened in poor locations the 
company said in the prospectus 
as a result of the lower levels of retail sales certain 
store owners have experienced significant difficulties in meeting 
their payment obligations to the company benetton said 
in 1965 the benetton family established a privatelyheld 
clothing concern that has become known for its colorful sportswear 
the family owns more than 80 percent of the company which 
earned 995 million in 1988 on revenue of 113 billion the 
family has been planning to increase public ownership of the 
company 
proceeds from the offering which will allow benetton to be 
listed on the new york and toronto stock exchanges will be used to 
retire debt

ford motor co unveiled an electricpowered 
minivan in the capital with a suggestion that the nations no 2 
automaker would welcome more government involvement to boost the 
fledgling technology 
joint governmentindustry initiatives are critical if any 
alternative fuel strategy is going to become a viable national 
option in the foreseeable future said john mctague fords vice 
president for research 
the aerostar van showed by ford at a hotel near the 
transportation department was powered by a sodiumsulfur battery 
with the drive provided by a motor mounted on the rear axle the 
inverter which converts direct current from the battery to the 
alternating current needed to run the motor was a new lighter and 
smaller design ford said 
company officials said the van has a 100mile driving range and 
a maximum speed of 65 mph with acceleration from a standstill to 
50 mph in less than 20 seconds the battery takes eight hours to 
recharge the company said 
the cost of operating the vehicle both replacing the battery 
every three or four years and recharging it is comparable with the 
cost of running a gasolinepowered vehicle at todays prices ford 
said 
electricpowered vehicles have been put forward as a longterm 
solution to the problems of diminishing petroleum supplies and 
increasing air pollution 
the system was developed jointly by the energy department ford 
general electric co and several battery manufacturers 
mctague said bringing the vehicle from the prototype stage to 
commercial practicality would require government support of battery 
research aimed at bringing down recharge times and substantial 
production to test out the vehicles for durability cost and 
acceptance 
bill day fords chief of public relations in washington hinted 
broadly that the company would need government purchase of the 
electric vehicles in order to build momentum for their use 
youve got to read between the lines days said citing 
other instances of new technology such as air bags where 
government purchases created the momentum that led to commercial 
success 
rep vic fazio dcalif planned this week to introduce 
legislation that would require conversion to cleanerburning fuels 
including electricity of most vehicles operated by the defense 
department and civilian federal agencies his office said 
the conversion would commence in 1993 at a rate of 10 percent of 
the federal fleet per year and would be finished in 2002 
with government support and the right market electrical 
vehicles could reach the commercial stage within 10 years mctague 
said 
the energy department has provided 95 percent of the 20 million 
spent on the electric vehicle program since 1982 and believes 
battery technology has reached a stage that would allow practical 
development of such cars without the need for breakthroughs said 
paul brown the departments director of electric and hybrid 
propulsion 
general motors corp and chrysler corp have also been working 
on electric technology for motor vehicles 
ford also showed a taurus outfitted with its prototype 
flexiblefuel system which can burn both unleaded gasoline and a 
mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline

americas steelusing manufacturers are split 
over whether steel import quotas should be extended by the bush 
administration when they expire in the fall 
a coalition of manufacturers opposed to the quotas got some 
competition wednesday when a rival group led by chrysler maytag 
and others was announced to lobby on behalf of the import curbs 
the new group claimed to have enlisted 374 members including 
makers of automobiles home appliances marine products beverage 
cans tableware and farm equipment 
the only thing the two coalitions have in common is that all 
their members use steel as a raw material 
the coalition for a competitive america was unveiled at a 
capitol press conference wednesday by sen jay rockefeller 
dwva and executives from chrysler corp of detroit crown cork 
and seal co of philadelphia milton can co of elizabeth nj 
unrleavitt of chicago maytag corp of newton iowa and others 
organizers said the coalition was created to help make the case 
for continuing steel import quotas due to expire sept 30 
domestic steel producers have proven they can compete with any 
steel producer in the world said rockefeller chairman of the 
senate steel caucus but they cannot compete with foreign 
governments that pump billions of dollars in subsidies into their 
stateowned steel operations 
the reagan administration negotiated fiveyear 
productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements in 1984 with 
japan south korea brazil south africa the european community 
and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the 
united states 
three days before last novembers election president bush 
pledged to continue the restraints in some form but with the us 
steel industry newly profitable opponents of the curbs believe 
they can make a case for ending the program or at least narrowing 
its scope 
the quota opponents have been led in part by caterpillar inc of 
peoria ill caterpillar is part of the coalition of american steel 
using manufacturers a 300member group that claims quotas have 
driven up steel prices and caused product shortages 
members of the new coalition said they formed the group to show 
that steelconsuming manufacturers are not widely opposed to trade 
protection as the older group suggests 
chrysler spokesman richard muller unrleavitt president roy a 
herman maytag government affairs counsel douglass horstman and 
crown cork and seal vice presidentpurchasing ronald thoma released 
statements chronicling how the quotas had helped turn the ailing 
steel industry around 
bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the senate and 
house that would enable the bush administration to begin 
negotiating new quota agreements with americas steeltrading 
partners 
but samuel berger counsel for the older coalition of american 
steel using manufacturers said in a telephone interview that the 
new group was already on the defensive 
i think they are concerned that the debate here has been 
expanded beyond simply whats good for the steel industry weve 
succeeded in getting people to understand that the debate is over 
whats good for the overall economy berger said

north american colonials viewed 
birdseye maple as one of natures defects but today lumbermen 
cant cut the trees fast enough 
the specks and whirling disfigurations of birdseye have become 
the fad of the wood world foresters say 
its a very hot wood now its hard to say why said steve 
stanton import veneers specialist for david r webb co inc in 
edinburgh ind it will continue to be until some gentleman 
decides the trendy wood is something else 
foreign buyers are snapping up so much of the rare north 
american wood that us producers have had to turn away domestic 
customers the wood has become even harder to find in the last six 
months with japan entering the market of wouldbe buyers 
i think our shortage of birdseye is because weve shipped it 
out we cant satisfy the guitar makers the clock manufacturers in 
our own country said bob owens of owens forest products in 
duluth minn 
importers from germany japan and taiwan make up the bulk of the 
foreign trade owens and stanton said wednesday in italy 
importers are dying the blond wood into all colors of the rainbow 
from pink to green 
the supply of birdy maple as foresters call it is scarce 
limited to a narrow band through new england and the great lakes 
by most estimates michigans upper peninsula produces the bulk of 
the specialty wood 
there birdseye is selling for as high as 1250 per board 
foot said upper peninsula forester gary willis 
a conservation group trying to buy a 300yearold virgin stand 
of pines along the upper peninsulas northernmost shore gulped when 
the timber companyowner named its price 
the quote was steep willis said not because the pines are ripe 
for cutting but because of the chance that birdseye maples are 
among the scattered maples in the stand 
theyre drooling over the birdseye willis said 
the price for long sections of birdseye veneer runs up to 
250 a square foot for a 10foot panel for comparison walnut 
veneer runs up to 50 cents a square foot stanton said 
but 25 years ago boynton glidden president of gmc hardwoods in 
dover mass tossed his birdseye logs aside for pallet lumber 
no one wanted birdseye at any price glidden said 
now the yuppies the wealthy they think its pretty if 
anyone has any its pretty easy to sell and the price is going up 
and up he said 
some companies still throw birdseye out with their less 
valuable boards one of the most common places to find its dotted 
planks is among the secondgrade maple in gymnasium floors 
meanwhile scientists remain unable to explain why it looks the 
way it does 
what causes birdseye dont ask me said dr henry huber 
a forestry professor at michigan state university there are a 
lot of theories maybe they are buds that didnt mature but none 
of them has proven out what can i say some trees have it some 
dont 
birdseye maple is hard to cut and the delicate little eyes 
tend to pop out during planing wood products manufacturers said 
and not every log that looks like birdseye turns out to be 
birdy 
theyre cruddy little nasty logs you buy 20 logs and maybe 
five of them have birds eyes said sue roberts of dooge veneers 
in grand rapids mich yet dooge veneers sells every birdseye 
maple log it can get 
nobody else has it she said

100 million in 1986 to settle civil insider trading charges 
brought by the securities and exchange commission 
he has since supplied information used toward civil or criminal 
charges in more than a dozen cases here and in britain in 
exchange he was allowed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy 
to lie to the sec 
the maximum penalty he faced was five years in prison and 
lasker who has a reputation as a lenient sentencer handed boesky 
a threeyear term 
lasker noted that even without any actions by him or the parole 
board boesky will be released from custody less than a year from 
today which is to say that the actual period he will have served 
will be slightly more than two years such a sentence is not unjust 
in the circumstances 
boeskys earliest nonparole release date based on good behavior 
is april 4 1990 
boesky claimed that his help led to a record plea bargain deal 
by drexel burnham lambert inc and the subsequent indictment of its 
junk bond chief michael milken and others on racketeering and 
securities fraud charges 
lasker said he took boeskys unprecedented cooperation into 
account when he passed sentence 
federal prosecutors took no stand on releasing boesky early but 
they noted in a letter to lasker who sentenced boesky dec 18 
1987 that the milken indictment and the 650 million tentative 
settlement of criminal charges drexel reached with the government 
was the centerpiece of boeskys cooperation 
the letter continued boeskys disclosures were the essential 
catalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in those 
cases other investigations arising directly from boeskys 
disclosures have also matured since boeskys sentencing 
but it added that the government nevertheless articulated the 
value of that cooperation in unqualified terms when boesky was 
sentenced

the securities and exchange commission is 
planning another try at finalizing its settlement of civil 
securities fraud charges against drexel burnham lambert inc 
a federal appeals court ruled wednesday that it did not have the 
authority to switch judges on the case 
but an sec lawyer said the ruling left open an option for 
seeking lower court approval of its deal with drexel 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals previously barred judge 
milton pollack who is assigned to the case from conducting 
hearings on the proposed settlement because his impartiality is 
being challenged before the us supreme court by former drexel 
junk bond chief michael milken who is not part of the settlement 
until the high court decides whether to consider milkens 
appeal pollack cannot take any action in the drexel case 
the sec and drexel tried to bypass the delay which could take 
months by asking the 2nd circuit to modify its stay and allow 
another judge to consider and possibly approve the settlement 
the appeals court however said that decision does not rest 
with us adding that the final word on assigning the case to 
another judge rests with judge pollack or with those responsible 
for the assignment of cases at the district court level in new 
york 
in washington sec solicitor paul gonson said the commission 
would not ask pollack to step aside rather were going to be 
asking the proper authorities to assign that part of the case to a 
second judge for the sole purpose of considering the settlement 
said gonson who oversees appeals for the sec 
gonson would not comment on what action the sec planned to take 
but a threejudge district court panel the committee on 
assignments normally would consider requests for reassignments of 
cases 
chief judge charles l brieant jr who chairs the committee 
said that if the sec requested an assignment change the panel 
would consult with pollack before making a decision 
the appeals courts refusal to assign a different judge 
continues to delay the landmark civil settlement as well as 
drexels record plea bargain to criminal charges 
resolution of the sec pact also is needed before drexel can 
formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay 650 million to 
settle criminal charges brought by the manhattan us attorneys 
office 
a drexel spokesman steven anreder said were going to be 
consulting with our counsel to see what options we have we believe 
the settlement should be implemented because its in the best 
interest of everybody 
drexel originally battled to get pollack to excuse himself from 
the case for an alleged conflict of interest because his wife 
stands to make a hefty profit from a debtfinanced acquisition 
drexel helped finance 
pollack refused to step down from the case and the 2nd circuit 
which delayed further district court proceedings pending its 
decision upheld pollack in november 
drexel eventually dropped its objections to pollack but the 
delay was extended when milken and his brother lowell who were 
both indicted for racketeering and securities law violations last 
month sought to argue the issue before the sumpreme court 
the 2nd circuit has delayed all proceedings before pollack 
pending a decision by the supreme court which has not yet decided 
whether it will hear the appeal

marvin davis launched his proxy fight to 
unseat the board of directors at northwest airlines parent company 
despite a conflict with the state commerce commissioner who is 
threatening to block davis tender offer in minnesota 
davis had until 2 pm today to supply objective facts to 
commerce commissioner michael hatch describing how he will operate 
the nations fourthlargest airline if his 27 billion tender 
offer is successful 
hatch said wednesday he will suspend the tender offer in 
minnesota if the deadline is not met blocking the estimated 1900 
shareholders in the state from selling their 13 million shares to 
davis 
there was no immediate reaction from davis hatch gave davis the 
option of asking for another hearing on the issue which would be 
held tonight 
meanwhile the los angelesbased billionaire proceeded with his 
proxy fight wednesday by mailing letters to those who hold the 291 
million shares of nwa inc the airlines parent 
davis is lobbying for votes in the election of 11 board members 
at nwas may 15 annual meeting the davis nominees would review 
all bona fide offers to buy the airline company including 
davis offer he wrote 
by voting for our slate you can mandate the sale of the 
company davis said in his letter 
nwas board has rejected davis 90ashare offer but has 
pledged to explore alternatives that would maximize shareholder 
value davis who owns about 28 percent of nwas shares said in 
his letter that he is skeptical of the claim 
he cited the companys refusal to withdraw its poison pill 
takeover defense plan and a requirement that northwest suitors sign 
a restrictive confidentiality agreement 
kurt rivard an analyst for minneapolisbased dain bosworth 
inc said the odds are against davis winning the proxy fight 
to oust an existing management is an uphill battle rivard 
said 
davis would be helped if nine dissident shareholders succeed in 
their attempt to force nwa to change proxy documents that limit the 
voting to those who held the stock as of march 17 
hennepin county district judge delila pierce said wednesday that 
the request deserves a hearing next week 
karl cambronne an attorney for the shareholders said because 
more than 65 percent of nwa stock has changed hands since march 17 
rivard said new owners would be more likely to vote for davis 
slate of nominees because they bought the stock on takeover rumors 
working against davis in his proxy fight is a provision in nwas 
poison pill that would prevent davis proposed board from 
selling the company for about six months davis sought to 
invalidate the provision in a lawsuit he filed in the court of 
chancery in wilmington del a judge on tuesday denied his request 
nwa is incorporated in delaware 
hatch said davis must explain how he would operate the airline 
in light of the large sum he proposes to borrow to buy it 
davis should objectively state whether he intends to demand 
wage and salary including productivity concessions from nwa 
employees hatch said davis has said he does not intend to sell 
the airlines strategic assets reduce payroll or move the 
headquarters from suburban eagan but his lawyers have indicated he 
may refinance or sell nwas tokyo real estate reduce travel agent 
commissions or change northwests inflight service 
nwa shares closed at 100 wednesday down 25 cents on the new 
york stock exchange

house speaker jim wright is promising 
corrective surgery on a 47 billion emergency spending bill 
that failed when members of his own party broke ranks on the first 
major budget vote of the year 
wright and his leadership team will have their first opportunity 
to recoup next week when they plan to bring to the floor their 
plan to implement a separate deficitreduction pact with president 
bush 
in the meantime wright promised to retool the emergency 
spending measure that was labeled a budget buster and rejected 
wednesday by republicans and democrats at both ends of the 
ideological spectrum 
the bill to expand current spending for veterans antidrug 
programs and other popular initiatives was forced back to committee 
after a leadership amendment to address the budgetbusting 
complaints was defeated 252172 
the timing of the defeat was bad for wright dtexas who is 
trying to show he can still command the house while besieged by an 
ethics committee probe into his personal finances only a day 
earlier wright had confidently predicted passage of the 
legislation 
however lawmakers of both parties doubted wednesdays vote was 
a direct reflection on wrights powers 
i dont think it reflects on leadership problems said 
majority leader thomas s foley dwash this is not a vote of 
confidence issue 
foley had proposed in the amendment to trim other programs 
including 1 billion from the military to help offset the cost of 
the new bill 
but white house budget director richard darman sent lawmakers a 
statement in which he said he would urge bush to veto the 
fiscally irresponsible measure 
and in a letter to house minority leader bob michel rill 
defense secretary dick cheney said the military cuts would force 
the pentagon to stop paying reenlistment bonuses reduce training 
hours eliminate five to 10 construction projects lay off 
scientists and engineers and curtail weapons testing 
this would have very serious consequences for the manning of 
our forces he wrote adding that he too would seek a veto 
the chairman of the house democratic caucus rep william h 
gray iii of pennsylvania said the vote was largely decided by the 
defense issue and individual members concerns about specific 
domestic programs 
if there was any indication about the democratic leadership it 
might be that the party votecounting in the house was made a 
little inaccurate from the lack of legislative activity so far this 
year he said 
because we have not been really focused legislatively members 
havent been giving accurate readings on their position he said 
the republicans meanwhile were free to exercise rebelliousness 
because they have no responsibility he said 
republicans were actively participating however in closeddoor 
drafting sessions on the fiscal 1990 budget 
the house budget committee carrying forth the deficiteduction 
pact announced at the white house earlier this month has been 
filling in some of the details on how to guide the spending and tax 
bills congress will consider this year 
after several days of cutting deals in secret on issues ranging 
from child care to bank insurance fees for foreign investors the 
committee planned a public session today for passing the 117 
trillion budget 
the full house could then take up the plan as early as next 
week when the senate also plans action on its version of the 
budget 
budget chairman leon panetta dcalif supported the foley 
amendment to the spending bill that was sent back to committee but 
he said he was not unhappy that the bill was sent back so that the 
deficitreduction agreement could move on the legislative calendar 
before a measure some saw as a deficit increaser 
while he was defeated on his amendment the purpose of the 
amendment was in part achieved because the bill would be revised 
foley said 
the bill rejected wednesday was titled by its supporters dire 
emergency supplemental appropriations and it included increases 
requested by the president but the budget committee had declined 
to go along with his proposal to offset the increases by cutting 
other domestic programs and not defense 
the bill included 12 billion for veterans programs 892 
million for guaranteed student loans 822 million for antidrug 
efforts and 600 million for last years forest fire costs 
the 47 billion measure would also provide 423 million for 
state foster care programs 250 million for reparations for 
japaneseamericans who were interned during world war ii 154 
million for the homeless 127 million for unemployment assistance 
100 million for refugee assistance and 88 million for public 
housing 
without offsetting cuts the bill would add to a deficit this 
year that already is expected to exceed the grammrudman laws 135 
billion target by 30 billion

a corporate jet worth over 1 million was sprayed 
signed and decorated with graffiti in an exuberant display of 
fun by the same aviation experts who lovingly maintain it 
kerry mcpherson director of marketing for the englewoodbased 
international jet aviation services said it was a 
onceinalifetime opportunity to display the companys 
unconventionalism 
it was our chance to be irreverent i guess he said of the 
recent treatment of the jet we treat these planes with such kid 
gloves all the time polishing cleaning and maintaining them like 
gems we were having fun 
the paint job a menacing open sharks jaw on the nose 
ganglike logos in dayglo colors on its fuselage and one graffiti 
tag that said elvis on board however was temporary 
the sixpassenger jet had reached 20 years of age and 12000 air 
hours and the federal aviation administration at that point 
requires a complete dismantling and overhaul of an aircrafts 
engine electronic and navigational systems part of that is a new 
paint job officials said 
so before the jet was flown to tucson ariz where the exterior 
is to be stripped and repainted in a respectable whiteonblue with 
red and gray stripes the company decided the have a little fun 
we figured it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to graffiti 
something thats worth over 1 million and still not get in trouble 
for it said doug strangfeld the firms maintenance director 
the paint job at centennial airport south of the denver 
metropolitan area pleased officials so much they flew to stapleton 
international airport and left it on the runway for a few hours to 
attract gawkers and amateur photographers 
it created a similar reaction in tucson officials said 
it was fantastic said strangfled when we got there it 
basically emptied the whole tucson facility 
the 350000 overhaul ordered by international jet official bill 
milam is a fourweek operation that also saved the company 6 
million for a new learjet

united airlines 157 billion order for as many 
as 370 boeing aircraft was prompted in part by public perceptions 
that new jets are safer than old ones chairman stephen wolf said 
wolf said wednesdays order the largest ever to a single 
aircraft manufacturer primarily reflects uniteds commitment to 
expand its fleet and regain the title of americas largest airline 
but united also will replace some of its aging planes he said 
the chicagobased airline has one of the oldest fleets in the 
industry with an average age of 135 years 
although wolf said airplanes will fly forever if maintained 
properly the decision to replace some united jets was motivated 
by two things the cost of maintaining older aircraft and public 
perception of older aircraft 
some things have happened of late to focus the consumer and 
focus congress on the issue of aging aircraft wolf said but 
in terms of that being a prod this is a business decision we were 
flowing toward anyway 
among the recent incidents focusing attention on aging aircraft 
was a feb 24 accident in hawaii involving a united boeing 747 the 
forward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off shortly after 
the plane left honolulu killing nine passengers 
the national transportation safety board finished a second day 
of hearings into that accident tuesday in seattle but officials of 
united and boeing said the timing of their announcement was purely 
coincidental 
the package includes firm orders for 180 boeing jetliners and 
options on 190 others 
uniteds order came just one week after irelands gpa group 
ltd an aircraft leasing firm ordered 17 billion in jets from 
boeing mcdonnell douglas corp and europes airbus industrie 
in another coup for boeing klm royal dutch airlines said today 
it plans to spend around 2 billion dutch guilders or 940 million 
to buy five new boeing 747400s and ten new 737s klm said the 
purchases are part of a program to standardize the type of planes 
it flies 
united is the nations secondlargest carrier behind american 
airlines during the first quarter of 1989 american flew 1689 
percent of the total domestic revenue passenger miles to uniteds 
1673 percent 
uniteds order includes firm plans for 120 twinengine boeing 
737s and 60 narrowbody 757s plus options on 130 737s and 60 757s 
united said it has ordered engines from cfm international a 
partnership of general electric co and the french jetengine maker 
snecma for the 737 jetliners the order is potentially worth 2 
billion cfm officials said 
the 757s will be powered by pratt amp whitney engines with a 
potential total value of 14 billion 
united spokeswoman sara dornacker said the engine costs were 
included in uniteds 157 billion estimate for the entire package 
it had been known for six months that united a subsidiary of 
ual corp was preparing a large order for 737s and 757s but the 
airline wanted to hold off ordering while it tried to get contract 
concessions from its pilots and flight attendants unions 
the airline is still negotiating with those workers but has come 
under increasing pressure to buy planes and lock in delivery 
positions because its competitors including american delta air 
lines and trans world airlines have placed orders in recent 
months 
i guess theyve decided to go ahead and show their good 
faith to the unions said louis marckesano an analyst who 
follows airlines for janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
he said the size of the order was a surprise but its whats 
needed to maintain their growth and their position in the industry 
in the next 10 years

the house banking committee today began 
considering an administrationendorsed effort to make owners of 
savings and loans put up more of their own actual money than 
president bush initially sought as the price for a 100 billion 
taxpayer bailout of the industry 
after closing a loophole that has allowed some nearly insolvent 
thrifts to challenge in court their takeover by federal regulators 
the committee began debating a measure that would shift some of the 
risk of sampl lending from the governments insurance funds 
without real capital hard capital the taxpayers have no 
protection said rep henry gonzalez dtexas the committees 
chairman 
gonzalez likened good will exemptions from hard cash stock 
or other equity capital requirements that the government over the 
past eight years has granted to sampls to a soft icecream cone in 
the july sun 
good will provides nothing if the institution goes down he 
said this entire exercise is a sham unless we change the way the 
savings and loans operate we cannot in good conscience require the 
taxpayers to pay out billions of dollars and at the same time tell 
them they must bear all the future risks 
earlier today the committee approved an amendment specifying 
that the federal deposit insurance corp has the authority to take 
over sick sampls even before they are technically insolvent 
two california thrifts are challenging in court their takeovers 
earlier this year by the fdic which claims it already has that 
authority although it is not spelled out specfically in the law 
as long as somebody can go into court they can get a weeks 
delay and essentially break the institution by selling off its 
assets during that week said rep charles schumer dny who 
sponsored the amendment and who ends up paying is us 
the banking committee voted wednesday to require the savings and 
loan industry to pour 75 million a year of its profits into 
lowincome housing subsidies as another price for the bailout 
the measure approved on a 2724 vote with four democrats 
joining all 20 committee republicans in opposition could provide 
up to 500000 home buyers a 2 percentage point discount on their 
home mortgages according to consumer groups 
however the political party lines are a little more obscure in 
that fight over tougher capital standards 
the administration gonzalez and the committees ranking 
republican rep chalmers wylie of ohio all favor making sampl 
owners put up 225 of their own real money or tangible 
capital for each 100 of lending 
sampl supporters claiming a third of the 2950 surviving thrifts 
in the nation could be wiped out by that stiff a requirement favor 
a 150 tangible capital requirement adopted last week by the 
senate and earlier by the house panels financial institutions 
subcommittee 
president bushs original proposal had no tangible capital 
requirement but treasury secretary nicholas brady said wednesday 
that the administration now believes there should now be a minimum 
3 tangible capital requirement for every 100 in loans 
however in a letter to wylie brady called his and gonzalez 
amendment calling for 225 a marked and welcome improvement 
wylie led the opposition to gonzalez amendment to require the 
12 regional federal home loan banks to set aside 5 percent of their 
profits 15 billion last year for providing lowinterest 
mortgage loans to the working poor 
the regional banks although created by the federal government 
are owned by the sampl industry and pass their profits on to 
individual sampls 
the legislation already requires sampls to put up 300000 a year 
through the regional banks as their contribution to the bailouts 
costs but taxpayers still will assume at least 70 percent of the 
estimated 250 billion to 300 billion burden over the next 30 
years 
democrats said the directed industry subsidies would restore the 
original purpose of the home loan bank system when it was 
established in the 1930s to promote home ownership among working 
families without it they said theres no reason for a separate 
sampl industry 
weve invited the taxpayers to the bailout banquet and told 
them they can pick up the tab but theyve got no silverware no 
salad no entrees said rep gerald kleczka dwis the least 
we can give them is some of the leftovers 
republicans however complained that making the industry devote 
a portion of its profits is nothing more than an endaround 
play for subsidized housing and called it a symbol of fiscal 
irresponsibility 
at stake in this bill is the safety and confidence in the 
financial fabric of this nation said rep jim leach riowa 
to play social policy games with this legislation jeopardizes 
confidence in the system 
the four democrats siding with the gop were reps frank annunzio 
of illinois stephen l neal of north carolina carroll hubbard jr 
of kentucky and doug barnard jr of georgia 
the committee also got into a first amendment fight over trying 
to stop advertising by some banks claiming that their federal 
insurance fund is safer than the one protecting sampl depositors 
against losses of up to 100000 each 
it eventually voted 3210 in favor of an amendment by rep david 
dreier rcalif directing the federal deposit insurance corp to 
outlaw ads that disparage the condition of either fund

ford motor co today said its firstquarter 
earnings rose nearly 1 percent to 164 billion the secondmost 
profitable threemonth period in automotive history 
ford the nations secondlargest automaker said its 
firstquarter results translated to 344 per share and compared 
with earnings of 162 billion or 331 per share in the first 
three months of 1988 
revenue totaled 2587 billion up 115 percent from 232 
billion during the first three months of 1988 
ford set a quarterly industry earnings record during the second 
quarter last year posting 166 billion in profit 
general motors corp last week reported its firstquarter 
earnings were 155 billion 422 percent more than the same period 
last year when the company changed its accounting method gms 
earnings came on revenue of 296 billion and worked out to 237 a 
share 
chrysler corp is expected to release firstquarter results next 
week 
ford said its firstquarter profit was buoyed by increased 
profits overseas a continuing source of money for the automaker 
the company said its us profits fell 56 percent to 800 million 
during the quarter principally because of sluggish sales and costs 
of incentives 
on march 29 ford set off the latest chain reaction of new 
incentive programs by offering financing as low as 29 percent on 
twoyear loans and increasing cash rebates and the number of 
vehicles covered by the program 
gm followed a day later and in less than a week chrysler 
announced its own package offering interestfree financing on 
twoyear notes 
the costs of the incentives are borne almost entirely by 
manufacturers although the programs were announced at the end of 
the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter they 
affect a large number of cars the big three produced during the 
first threemonth period of the year 
ford also said earnings by its financial services subsidiary 
which provides consumer car loans among other things fell 413 
percent to 141 million from 240 million the company said profits 
were squeezed by rising interest on the money it borrowed and lower 
interest payments from the money it loaned apparently through 
incentives 
the financial services made up 86 percent of fords profit 
while its automobile operations made up 914 percent firstquarter 
profits in the automotive sector rose 82 percent to 15 billion 
from 138 billion

the airlines in 1978 a senior eec official said wednesday 
sir leon brittan the eecs commissioner for competition policy

challenge for the community will be to learn from the us 
experience and avoid the pitfalls encountered there

airline industry as part of its plan to dismantle all internal 
barriers to free movement of people trade services and capital by 
1993 
the twoday icaa symposium which ended thursday discussed the 
implications for airports 
brittan said the eec commission the 12nation trading blocs

repetition of the spate of takeovers which occurred among us 
airlines 
he said the commission would look at proposed airline mergers on 
a casebycase basis seeking the preservation and promotion of 
the position of new entrants as well as smaller regional and

transportation secretary samuel skinner is 
winning praise for his handling of tough issues for the bush 
administration as head of a department touched by a wide range of 
crises 
the former federal prosecutor and chicago mass transit 
administrator joined the new administration as a washington 
outsider but is rapidly becoming one of the most visible members of 
president bushs cabinet 
skinner who is in europe this week on his second diplomatic 
mission concerning international air terrorism has been bushs 
point man on several issues that might have been handled by 
officials in other departments 
skinner said at his senate confirmation hearing im not going 
to take a back seat 
he was referring to possible disagreements with the state 
department over foreign air agreements but he has climbed into the 
front seat on other issues as well including air terrorism drug 
interdiction the alaskan oil spill and the eastern airlines strike 
skinners european trip followed a meeting he and british 
transport officials organized in montreal to push for a coordinated 
defense against air terrorism 
he earlier traveled to the caribbean to assess antidrug 
activities of the coast guard 
when the exxon valdez ran aground in alaskas prince william 
sound on march 24 spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and 
creating an environmental disaster skinner flew to alaska as the 
lead cabinet officer dealing with the cleanup 
the transportation department has responsibility over all air 
sea and ground transportation as well as pipelines and the coast 
guard 
on balance hes addressed most issues professionally and 
frontally with moxie and political skill said aviation 
consultant dean sparkman both businesswise and socially sams a 
winner 
subordinates at transportation describe skinner as tough but 
personable reporters who suggest ulterior motives in any of his 
highprofile actions get a curt you dont know me very well 
but at the end of his first press briefing he softened his tough 
image by pulling out a model airplane that played the tune fly me 
to the moon 
relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the dec 21 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland say skinner was the 
first administration official to show them compassion and listen to 
their complaints about government action or inaction in the case 
skinner who headed bushs presidential campaign in illinois 
has received praise for his administrative skill from both 
democrats and republicans in congress and from all sides in the 
transportation industry although not all of his positions have 
been popular with both management and labor 
senate commerce committee chairman ernest hollings dsc 
called skinner a breath of fresh air before unanimous 
confirmation by the senate 
skinners toughest critics have been in the machinists union 
which had tried to get the administration to step in and prevent 
the march 4 eastern strike skinner recommended against it and then 
defended bushs inaction to the unions and congress 
we are extremely disappointed in his running of the department 
of transportation and hope in the future he will not automatically 
side with management said machinists spokesman jim conley 
the airline pilots association which joined the walkout and 
members of the independent national mediation board also expressed 
dismay at the administrations refusal to step in eastern which 
since has shut down most of its operations and filed for 
reorganization under bankruptcy laws opposed government action 
in some other matters skinner has defied corporate interests 
he joined environmental protection agency chief william reilly in 
recommending tougher mileage standards for automobiles and he is 
insisting that airlines pay for devices he has ordered installed in 
airports to scan luggage for plastic explosives 
but even officials who disagree with some of skinners positions 
give him high marks as an administrator 
hes clearly emerging as a very good secretary of 
transportation said stephen hayes spokesman for the air 
transport association which represents major airlines and believes 
the government should pay for security 
robert j aaronson ata president said skinner inherited an 
inadequate system and faces insufficient airports understaffed air 
traffic control operations and tough security problems the 
airlines want the federal aviation administration split off as a 
separate agency 
carroll carter executive director of the international mass 
transit association and a former transportation department 
official called skinner a very practical person in political 
terms his appeals to transit authorities to seek funding from 
sources other than the federal government are well received by 
transit officials because they believe he is sincere and 
understands the complexity of the industry carter said 
carol perkins spokeswoman for the american association of 
railroads said skinner has been warmly received by the railroad 
industry

sony corp will research highdefinition 
television at a silicon valley facility as part of a longterm 
commitment to building an extensive us engineering and 
manufacturing base the company said thursday 
sony is hoping its advanced video technology center in san jose 
calif will help it localize products for the us market while 
defusing political tensions over the next generation of television 
today hdtv is being held hostage as a symbol of the need for 
improving american competitiveness this is in our opinion most 
unfortunate neil vander dussen president of sony corp of 
america said at a news conference 
sony is contributing to the country as much as any usbased 
company would by locating factories and laboratories in the united 
states and buying parts locally vander dussen said 
the center has 25 engineers and will eventually expand to 50 
roughly 80 percent of them americans sony said the center will 
focus on hdtv editing and production equipment rather than on the 
televisions themselves 
sonys approach to technology development is global said 
masaki morita chairman of sony america at the same time we 
recognize that many contributions are local 
sony is a world leader in hdtv it has made hdtv production 
equipment in japan since 1984 and in the united states for about 
two years 
japanese industry overall has a large lead over us concerns in 
developing hdtv which promises motion picture quality images and 
compact disc quality sound and is expected to be a 50 billion 
industry by the year 2000 
sony is among dozens of companies that have applied for 30 
million in hdtv research funds being made available by the defense 
departments defense advanced research projects agency or darpa 
some lawmakers have said they didnt want to see us tax 
dollars going to foreign companies to develop a us hdtv industry 
but vander dussen said the united states would benefit if sony 
got darpa money because the company would transfer technology from 
japan to this country as part of its project 
sony has made two offers seeking less than 10 million in darpa 
funding 
this was more of a good will or outreach program on our part 
to allow the us government to own and take advantage of the 
techniques we had developed over the years william connolly 
president of sonys advanced systems group said in a telephone 
interview 
if sony got us funds for hdtv research the studies would take 
place at the san jose facility connolly said 
prior to consolidation in san jose sony had operated the sony 
technology center in palo alto calif together with an 
engineering and technical support facility in san jose 
the center since 1980 has actively supported hdtv development 
efforts in japan and has undertaken some direct hdtv work sony 
said 
connolly said the new center will develop products for the 
motion picture and tv industries he pointed to a recent agreement 
with panavision a major manufacturer of 35mm movie cameras to 
adapt sony hdtv cameras for motion picture production as an example 
of the kialition of japanese and american firms that supports the 
socalled 1125 scanline 60 frame rate hdtv production standard 
sony for a number of years has produced studio production and 
editing equipment based on the 112560 standard 
connolly emphasized that sony still supports that standard 
although a number of us broadcasters seem to be backing away from 
it in the face of adamant opposition from european companies that 
want a standard based on a 50 frame rate

this summer unless the us customs service can increase the number

conrail has approached the providence 
and worcester railroad co about a possible merger and the two 
companies are discussing both an acquisition and financial support 
from conrail for construction projects 
pampw and conrail issued a joint statement wednesday during pampws 
annual shareholders meeting saying the companies have begun talks 
to explore the advantages of reaching an agreement which could 
lead to the generation of additional freight traffic for the 
benefit of both parties 
the talks could lead to pampws acquisition by conrail an 
infusion of capital from conrail to pampw or joint efforts to build 
more freight facilities on pampw lines the statement said 
pampw won its independence from the old penn central railroad in a 
1973 court ruling and has grown since then from a 44mile line 
linking its namesake cities to a 375mile system with 175 
employees that serves rhode island massachusetts and connecticut 
much of pampws growth has come by absorbing former conrail lines 
that the larger railroad abandoned as unprofitable pampw is now the 
only freight railroad in rhode island 
conrail has 32600 employees and operates on 13100 miles of 
track in the northeast and midwest if it acquires the pampw it 
would be conrails first acquisition of another railroad since it

corn futures prices rose thursday on the chicago 
board of trade amid rumors that the soviet union was about to 
announce a major corn purchase 
wheat futures prices dropped on rumors that the bush 
administration has suspended us subsidies of foreign wheat sales 
soybean prices closed lower 
corn was high because of rumors the ussr was going to buy 15 
to 2 million metric tons said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
soybeans were under pressure throughout the day as word 
circulated that the brazilian courts were set to rule on the 
legality of a dock strike that is holding up that countrys soybean 
exports 
the thinking is the court is going to be against the 
dockworkers and the army is going to be used to break up the strike 
if it continues lespinasse said 
an extended dockworkers strike in brazil the worlds 
secondlargest soybean producer could result in increased world 
demand for us soybeans 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for may delivery at 405 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 3

eastman kodak co and walt disney co 
announced thursday they had signed a 15year promotional agreement 
that is one of the longest and most comprehensive either company 
has ever entered 
there isnt a division of our company or a subdivision for 
that matter that isnt involved in this agreement said frank 
wells president and chief operating officer for disney 
kodak will pay disney an undisclosed multimilliondollar 
amount for the various promotional opportunities and serve as 
official supplier of film batteries cameras still video and 
other photographic products 
disney has agreed to exclusively use kodak movie film at its 
movie studios and exclusively sell kodak photographic products when 
available instant film which kodak does not sell will be 
supplied by polaroid corp 
the old agreement which was due to expire soon only covered 
the sale of film at disneyland and disney world and the use of 
disney characters 
the key to the agreement which enlarges an alliance the two 
firms have had since the early 1980s is eurodisneyland which is 
scheduled to open in 1992 
kodak estimates that 5 percent of the 14 billion amateur 
snapshots taken in the united states each year are snapped on 
disney property thats roughly 700 million photos 
if 5 percent of the pictures in the united states are taken at 
disney theme parks wed be delighted if 5 percent taken in europe 
were taken at disney theme parks said j phillip samper vice 
chairman and executive officer at kodak 
disneys japanese park in tokyo is not included in the 
agreement but the spruce goose and the queen mary both 
disneyowned attractions in california will be included 
because weve been together now for several years and have 
gotten very used to each other we knew we wanted to set a course 
for many more years wells said after signing the contract 
wednesday 
you get kodak and disney people together thinking up ideas 
and everything seems to multiply said samper 
there is i would dare say twice the ways of reaching the 
public in terms of the volume of what we do then when the 
original agreement was done wells said 
the companies have been involved with each other for more than 
50 years 
kodak was an early participant at disneyland which opened in 
1955 and was a sponsor of disneys wonderful world of color 
television show in the late 1950s when only 700000 color tv sets 
existed in the united states

teenagers are more likely to listen to the radio 
than to read a newspaper on an average day says a survey presented 
to the american newspaper publishers association 
ninetythree percent of the young people surveyed ages 12 to 
17 said they listened to the radio during an average weekday 
fortyone percent said they read a newspaper and 23 percent said 
they watched an evening television news broadcast on an average 
weekday 
radio is basically an entertainment media a background 
media said dotty shea senior project director for the newspaper 
advertising bureau 
many of teens that i talked to said hey i got the radio on 
in the background while im doing my homework talking to my 
friend they did not usually just sit there and listen to the radio 
by itself reading a newspaper is a much more focused activity 
the survey conducted by simmons media research and the 
newspaper advertising bureau last year was presented to the 
publishers group wednesday the final day of the anpa convention 
it was based on interviews with 1074 teens in a period late 
last year marked by soviet president mikhail gorbachevs visit to 
the united states the earthquake in soviet armenia and a space 
shuttle flight 
thirtyeight percent of the teenagers surveyed said they could 
think of a news item during that period that was notable to them 
twentyfive percent listed newspapers as their prime source for the 
time of interest while 47 percent gave television as their source 
teens tend to be introduced to newspapers through the comics 
said leo bogart retiring executive vice president of the newspaper 
advertising bureau who presented the survey to the publishers 
he urged the publishers and editors to spread stories of 
interest to teens throughout the paper and not assign them to an 
editorial ghetto 
christine urban a media consultant from sharon mass warned 
publishers to stop tinkering at the margins of papers by making 
editorial changes and instead to consider rethinking the whole 
style the whole presentation in trying to lure teens

a spurt of public works projects in march halted 
a decline in the value of the nations construction contracts 
although housing and nonresidential building projects continued to 
slide according to figures released thursday 
the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill information services co 
said the value of new construction edged up 1 percent to a 
projected annual rate of 2361 billion 
the slight increase which followed a 7 percent decline in 
february resulted from a 22 percent rise in nonbuilding 
construction from the previous month for march public works and 
utilities construction climbed to an annualized total value of 
492 billion compared with 403 billion in february 
for the entire first quarter however the unadjusted total of 
all newly started construction stood at 53 billion a decline of 3 
percent from the same period a year ago 
first quarter data show that the 1989 rate of contracting was 
nearly 10 percent below its peak reached in mid1987 said george 
christie fw dodges chief economist twothirds of the cutback 
since then can be accounted for by just two building types 
offices and apartments 
the unadjusted value of nonresidential building construction 
fell 4 percent in the first quarter to 186 billion compared with 
193 billion in the first quarter last year 
from february to march the adjusted annual value of 
nonresidential building construction fell 5 percent to 784 
billion the annualized value of residential construction also 
declined in march falling 1 percent to 1084 billion

ford motor cos first quarter profit was 
08 percent higher than in the same period last year as overseas 
earnings offset a drop in domestic profits the automaker reported 
thursday 
ford said its profit of 164 billion or 344 a share came on 
revenue of 2587 billion that compared with a profit of 162 
billion or 331 per share on revenue of 2319 billion a year 
earlier 
a week ago general motors corp reported it earned 155 
billion or 237 per common share on revenues of 296 billion 
during the first three months of the year chrysler corp was 
expected to announce its firstquarter results next week 
at a news conference ford vice president and treasurer david 
mccammon fords firstquarter profits were buoyed by a 10 percent 
increase in overseas earnings earnings in the united states the 
basis for profitsharing computations fell 56 percent to 800 
million and could continue to slump he said 
he said ford was cutting about 2 percent from its secondquarter 
production schedule but much of it would come out of overtime 
ford also reported earnings for its carfinancing arm ford 
motor credit co dropped 491 percent to 1016 million from 
1997 million ford motor chairman william odom said the decline 
mainly stemmed from rising costs of borrowing and lower profit 
margins due partly to costs of buyer incentive programs 
odom said fords cost of borrowing in the first quarter this 
year was 92 percent compared with 8 percent a year earlier 
rising interest rates prompted by fed credittightening moves 
aimed at slowing the economy to curb inflation and 
slowerthananticipated car and truck sales prompted ford on march 
29 to begin offering new buyer incentive programs featuring 
cutrate auto loans gm and chrysler followed suit with similar 
programs 
mccammon the company expected an economic slowdown over the rest 
of the year which would keep the federal reserve from pushing 
interest rates higher mccammon said he expected interest rates 
actually to fall during the second half of the year 
the costs of the latest incentives should affect the 
corporations second quarter earnings ford earnned an industry 
record 166 billion in second quarter 1988 the incentives expire 
may 31 but could be extended 
financial services made up 86 percent of fords profit while 
its automobile operations made up 914 percent firstquarter 
profits in the automotive sector rose 82 percent to 15 billion 
from 138 billion 
when asked if fords earnings for all of 1989 would be lower 
than the 53 billion it earned last year mccammon said at this 
point that would be the guess 
during the first 20 days of april with the incentives in full 
force fords car sales increased 273 percent over the same time 
last year meanwhile gms sales rose 72 percent and chryslers 
were off 12 percent compared with the same time last year 
mccammon said he couldnt be specific about the costs of the 
incentives but the new package costs the company between 100 and 
150 a vehicle more than the previous package did 
accordingly if fords estimate that 55 percent of the nonfleet 
cars it sells are covered by the incentive package the company has 
paid an extra 76 million to 114 million in incentive costs for 
the cars sold during the first 20 days of this month

wall streets threeyear scandal binge capped 
by the recent drexel burnham lambert inc fraud case settlements 
has sapped investor confidence and forced investment firms and 
securities regulators to reexamine compliance procedures experts 
said thursday 
newspaper stories about levine and boesky wang and drexel 
burnham hardly ensure deep confidence in the public in the 
financial markets said us district judge kevin duffy said 
referring to four of the decades most prominent insider trading 
cases 
duffy a former securities and exchange commission regional 
director in new york was one of more than 200 state regulators 
government prosecutors and investment executives attending a north 
american securities administrators association conference on the 
impact of whitecollar crime on public policy 
duffy and others called for greater selfpolicing by securities 
and commodities firms to help prevent fraud 
under its landmark settlement of fraud and insider trading 
charges with the sec earlier this month drexel pledged to boost 
its internal compliance measures and agreed to tight sec monitoring 
for three years 
securities regulators said implementation of the deal was being 
closely watched for indications whether it prompts other firms to 
toughen internal compliance measures as a deterrent to 
marketrelated crime 
drexel will be an example for other companies who dont want 
to be the next one said susan bryant securities administrator 
for oklahoma who heads a panel preparing action by that state 
against drexel 
she said amendments congress approved last year to the 1934 
securities and exchange act also should put pressure on individual 
firms brokerages now can be held liable for failing to enforce 
their own internal control procedures 
i think things like the drexel settlement are just the 
beginning bryant said i think regulators are going to be 
looking at these procedures to see if it works 
rep ron wyden dore a member of two house subcommittees 
examining securities law reform said congress likely would be 
pressed this term to boost sec funding and allow the commission to 
fine individuals up to 100000 per violation and institutions up 
to 500000 for securities law violations 
they dont have the resources to deal with two major cases at 
once without the rest of the agencys caseload being altered he 
said 
wyden wouldnt characterize drexels sec deal and its 650 
million plea settlement with the manhattan us attorneys offices 
as inadequate but said 
certainly the sum of money is very large by anybodys 
pocketbook calculation but as incredible as it seems its about 
in the ballpark of what michael milken makes in one year 
milken is the former drexel junk bond financier who was named in 
the sec suit against drexel and later charged in a separate 
98count racketeering and fraud indictment the government claims 
he made more than 1 billion in four years including 550 million 
in 1987 
hardwick simmons vice chairman of shearson lehman hutton inc 
a major wall street brokerage house said the industry already 
spends 300 million annually on selfregulation and routinely 
cooperates with authorities 
that doesnt mean were going to catch all those who abuse 
others and the system he said it does mean well do 
everything we can to prevent it 
duffy a judge in the southern district of new york where the 
major wall street securities fraud cases are being tried said the 
case of broker dennis levine whose revelations led prosecutors to 
notorious insider trader ivan boesky was tied up with a bow and 
delivered to the sec because of internal compliance by levines 
firm

strikebound eastern airlines three days after 
outlining a plan for cutting away 18 billion in assets thursday 
announced a deal to lease 14 boeing 727200 planes to rival pan 
american world airways 
the 966 million 5year lease gives pan am an option to extend 
the lease or buy the planes at a price to be negotiated eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the agreement must be approved by 
the us bankruptcy court in new york which has had oversight of 
such deals since eastern filed march 9 for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization and protection 
we had indicated we would be raising about 18 billion 
through assets sales ms ceremsak said this is certainly the 
first step in this direction for the new reducedsize airline 
eastern president phil bakes described the planned streamlining 
of eastern on monday after parent texas air corp ruled out a sale 
of eastern in its entirety bakes said eastern would rebuild with a 
smaller airline and pay its debts by slashing service 29 percent 
from prestrike levels and selling assets 
easterns unions on strike since march 4 continue to hope the 
bankruptcy court and easterns creditors will call for a sale of 
the airline us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has set for 
may 3 a hearing on why eastern shouldnt be sold to the highest 
bidder in its entirety including its northeast shuttle service 
slated to be sold to developer donald trump for 365 million 
ms ceremsak said there was considerable industry interest in 
eastern assets such as planes airport gates and routes and that 
the beleaguered company was receiving good offers 
theres a tremendous demand right now for airplanes by other 
carriers that are expanding she said the delivery positions 
and orders are backed up in the factories 
she said she didnt have any information on other asset sales in 
the works but added there have been many interested parties 
obviously there are going to be other transactions 
easterns plan calls for a fleet of 157 aircraft down from 
around 250 before the strike if the 14 149seat 727 planes are 
leased to pan am at 115000 a month and another 21 of the 727s are 
sold to trump in the planned shuttle sale that would leave eastern 
with 60 other excess aircraft for sale or longterm lease ms 
ceremsak said 
pilots union spokesman jb stokes said the airlines unions 
oppose any transfer of eastern assets while hoping the bankruptcy 
court will approve a buyout of the whole company 
they can make all the plans they want stokes said i 
think they neglect to tell the people they must get approval from 
the bankruptcy court thats a fairly lengthy process and its not 
going to happen overnight 
the shuttle sale also must be approved by the court

silver futures prices dropped sharply thursday on new yorks 
commodity exchange on selling prompted by indications of ample 
supplies 
on other markets gasoline and crude oil prices fell cattle 
lost ground while hog prices rallied and wheat and soybean futures 
slipped while corn rose 
silver settled 118 cents to 152 cents lower with may at 564 
a troy ounce 
pressure built in the silver market ahead of friday the first 
day for traders to post their intention to deliver physical silver 
against the may contract 
the drop reflected the large deliveries expected said 
stephen w platt an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
a large number of delivery notices would suggest that producers 
have adequate supplies of silver on hand 
the downward pressure also tended to reflect the high 
warehouse stocks platt said 
gold prices fell in sympathy with silver and on signs of selling 
by gold dealers platt said 
there is a general feeling that if the economy is slowing 
down metal finishing demand wont be there he said 
gold settled 210 to 380 lower with june at 38610 a troy 
ounce 
petroleum futures settled mixed on the new york mercantile 
exchange on positionevening ahead of the expiration friday of the 
gasoline and heatingoil contracts traders also were nervous over 
the possibility that opec members may increase their crudeoil 
production later this year 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 27 cents 
lower with june at 2092 a barrel heating oil was 33 cent to 88 
cent higher with may at 5186 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
06 cent to 60 cent lower with june at 7227 cents a gallon 
hogs were up pork bellies were down and cattle futures were 
narrowly mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the recent rise in porkmarket volatility reflects conflicting 
views of whether cash prices for hogs have reached their normal 
seasonal bottom 
the hog market tends to make a bottom in late april then trend 
higher into the summer as the flow of hogs to slaughter slows 
it has to do with the seasonality of the farrowing of pigs and 
the seasonality of when they come to market said dale durchholz 
an analyst with agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
he said cash hog prices have recently approached 40 per 
hundredweight a signal that futures prices may be working higher 
but its a little bit premature to say it with any real 
conviction 
live cattle settled 20 cent lower to 40 cent higher with june 
at 7082 cents a pound feeder cattle were 08 cent lower to 05 
cent higher with may at 7582 cents a pound live hogs were 18 
cent lower to 40 cent higher with june at 4707 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 28 cent to 1 cent lower with may at 3237 
cents a pound 
corn futures prices rose on the chicago board of trade amid 
rumors of a major corn purchase by the soviet union after the 
close the agriculture department announced the soviets had 
purchased 150000 metric tons of us corn 
wheat futures prices dropped and soybean prices closed lower 
soybeans were under pressure throughout the day as word 
circulated that the brazilian courts were set to rule on the 
legality of a dock strike that is holding up that countrys soybean 
exports and could lead to increased global demand for us soybeans 
the thinking is that the court is going to be against the 
dockworkers and the army is going to be used to break up the strike 
if it continues said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter in chicago 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 405 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with may at 268 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 177 a 
bushel soybeans were 11 cents lower to 1 cent higher with may at 
729 a bushel

gasoline futures prices closed flat to lower in 
active trading thursday reversing the sharp runup of recent days 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for 
unleaded gasoline finished the day at 7812 cents a gallon 
unchanged from wednesday the last time gasoline closed higher was 
on nov 27 1985 when it settled at 79 cents 
analysts said the weakness in gasoline was expected because 
current price levels are exaggerated and could not be sustained 
indefinitely gasoline futures have surged 65 percent since jan 1 
crude oil that is traded on the exchange was down across the 
board the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of crude oil fell 27 cents to 2092 a barrel other contract 
months lost as much as 19 cents 
heating oil for may delivery rose 088 cent to 5186 cents a 
gallon other contract months also gained 
may contracts for heating oil and gasoline are scheduled to 
expire on friday 
john h oconnell analyst with refco inc said softer gasoline 
prices were not a surprise 
i dont think the market can go straight up oconnell said 
in the last few days people who were short took a beating 
oconnell said the fall in crude prices probably pressured the 
gasoline market and reflected expectations of higher world 
production 
there is a belief in the market that the saudis are signaling 
a lifting of ceilings making the market rethink its price 
levels oconnell said 
consumer gasoline prices which are usually more than 20 cents 
below wholesale prices have surged in recent weeks playing 
catchup to the sharp rise in crude prices since last december some 
analysts predict a further rise in retail gas prices but at a 
slower rate than in recent weeks as market conditions stabilize 
industry estimates put opec production at about 2 million 
barrels a day higher than its selfimposed quota of 185 million 
barrels saudi arabia is the largest opec producer and the worlds 
largest exporter 
analysts say excess production from opec has offset much of the 
supply disruptions stemming from the alaska spill and last weeks 
north sea gas explosion 
the main factor driving up gasoline prices in recent weeks are 
the new federal regulations scheduled to take effect this summer 
lowering the amount of lead content in gasoline the higher octane 
formula requires the refining of more crude oil to make the new 
gasoline 
since demand is perceived to be rising while the capacity of the 
nations refineries are thought to be declining expectations of 
possible tight supplies of gasoline have sent wholesale prices 
soaring 
but some observers believe that the current price rises are not 
warranted and that refiners and wholesalers raised their prices 
before a shortage or tightness actually occurred a lot of oil and 
oil products are actually in storage analysts said 
despite the unpredictable events over the last several months 
we still do not see the fundamental support for recent price 
levels and we still anticipate a correction the petroleum 
consulting firm of purvin amp gertz inc said in its weekly analysis 
the department of energy recently made what analysts said was a 
substantial downward revision in its demand estimate for january 
the doe also lowered refinery output but raised inventory estimates 
to show a higher level than earlier recorded 
demand for february and march also are believed to be lower than 
earlier predicted 
despite lower refinery capacity analysts say that detailed 
studies indicate that both volume and octane capabilities will be 
sufficient to meet demand

unisys corp is poised to overcome a 
firstquarter loss sustained during delays in putting a new 
computer line on sale chairman w michael blumenthal said thursday 
sales of the new 2200 series mainframe computers and expected 
gains in defense business despite tight military budgets and a 
procurement investigation should reassure shareholders 
blumenthal said 
unisys recently reported it lost 787 million in the first 
quarter compared with net income of 1493 million or 72 cents a 
share in the first quarter of 1988 
this was essentially an anomaly he told a news conference 
these products are now reaching the marketplace and therefore 
prospects are considerably brighter 
blumenthal was in detroit for unisys 1989 stockholders meeting 
unisys was formed when burroughs corp took over sperry corp in 
a 48 billion deal in 1986 
the company said orders for its 1100 series of mainframe 
computers had fallen off and customers were still waiting for 
shipments of the 2200 series introduced feb 21 
demand for mainframe computers has been flat blumenthal said 
but thats a problem the entire industry has faced he said 
blumenthal said companies may be holding off on major capital 
expenditures out of fears of inflation or an impending economic 
slowdown 
the governments procurement investigation and the suspension of 
three former sperry divisions from military contracts also hurt 
earnings blumenthal said 
allegations of overcharges in 1983 in connection with a sperry 
contract to upgrade the air forces worldwide computer system led 
to a 700000 cash settlement by unisys in march and dismissal of 
the governments charges 
blumenthal said unisys incurred costs in cooperating with the 
investigation and making sure these particular things cannot 
happen within the unisys organization 
he said unisys also hopes for gains despite tight federal 
budgets through government contracts that can help cut spending 
through efficient computer use 
unisys can get more business he said as the government looks 
for areas where it can reduce its costs and our people are a way 
to do that

gannett co incs flagship usa today is moving 
steadily toward profitability based on projections of increasing 
circulation and higher prices to thirdparty buyers such as hotels 
company directors told shareholders thursday 
the shareholder meeting marked the formal passing of the 
corporate baton from allen neuharth founder of usa today and 
retiring chairman and chief executive officer to successor john j 
curley 
neuharth who turned 65 last month said he had been asked 
repeatedly during the american newspaper publishers association 
convention this week for his feelings about retirement 
im ecstatic about it he said 
then taking note of the runup in gannett co stock in recent 
weeks neuharth added if i had known that merely by retiring as 
chairman the stock would climb by 15 percent over the last month 
i would have done it earlier 
the company is riding a streak of 86 consecutive quarters of 
record quarterly profits despite that performance usa today has 
lost about 600 million before taxes since its september 1982 
debut recording just two quarterly profits during that stretch 
thomas curley president and chief operating officer of usa 
today told shareholders he expected usa today to be profitable in 
both the second and fourth quarters of 1989 
but he still predicted that for the full year we should lose 
a little especially if the economy weakens the goal for 1990 
is to open the window of profit 
thomas curley said the newspapers profitability would be 
bolstered by an increase in the price of usa today to suppliers who 
give the newspapers away with each increase of one cent worth 
about 4 million in revenues 
he also said circulation had climbed by 82 percent in 1988 for 
the fridayweekend edition and 61 percent for the remaining four 
weekdays 
john quinn who is editorinchief of usa today said he hoped 
the meeting would end the dumb comparisons being made between 
neuharth and curley each of whom he lauded as the right man at 
the right time 
and indeed curley proved just as adept at straight talk as 
neuharth while presiding over his first annual meeting and the 
companys 22nd since going public 
when accuracy in medias reed irvine said that a survey of 
business executives revealed that most felt newspapers coverage of 
business and businessmen was biased curley replied 
a lot of them businessmen are used to adulatory business 
coverage by their own press departments and they may get a little 
rabbiteared because theyre used to hearing what fine fellows they 
are

a former superbroker for 
painewebber inc won a breach of contract and defamation suit 
against the securities firm on thursday but a jury awarded him 
only 18 cents in damages in a verdict that he nevertheless termed a 
moral victory 
former broker geoffrey j winters had sought 16 million in 
damages but the bridgeport superior court jury also found that he 
owed the wall street firm money for two promissary notes plus 
attorneys fees resulting from the legal battle which reduced his 
award to just 18 cents if the verdict holds up 
winters attorney said his client achieved a moral victory 
painewebber cant treat people like this again said 
attorney john h chapman these jurors are now telling them 
they have to be ethical 
winters agreed he had secured a moral victory but declined 
further comment 
alan r spirer painewebbers attorney said he considered 
painewebber the victor in light of winters reduced damage award 
he also said he would file motions to set aside the verdict and to 
reduce the damage award 
the complicated case had been watched closely on wall street 
because it is unusual for brokers to sue their former employers 
the case began in 1982 when winters left lehman brothers kuhn 
loeb now shearson lehman hutton inc to join painewebber he and 
other new employees who produced more than 1 million in annual 
commissions were touted as superbrokers to potential 
painewebber customers 
when he joined the firm winters was given two fiveyear 
promissary notes by painewebber for 240000 and 60000 
respectively both were secured by a 300000 bonus winters 
received from the company 
on march 23 1984 painewebber fired winters for alleged willful 
misconduct winters filed suit in new york state and federal 
courts claiming painewebber had hired him only to steal his 
multimilliondollar client base 
painewebber sued him in bridgeport superior court to collect on 
the promissary notes the company also filed a 300000 lien on 
winters greenwich home winters attached several counterclaims 
contending he had been defamed and seeking damages 
the new york lawsuits were put on hold pending the outcome of 
the connecticut case spirer said thursdays verdict also renders 
moot the pending lawsuit in new york state court although chapman 
refused to discuss the matter 
the bridgeport jury decided winters must repay the 300000 for 
the two promissary notes plus 140000 in attorney fees or a 
total of 440000 to painewebber 
the jury awarded winters 140000 in damages on his claim that 
painewebber improperly took possession of winters personal files 
preventing him from doing business and causing him damage and 
300000 on his claim that painewebber made false and defamatory 
statements about winters in a wall street publication 
the jury also awarded winters nominal damages on three other 
counterclaims against the firm including his breach of contract 
complaint 
because the relationship between painewebber and winters 
occurred in new york the damages were based on new york state law 
chapman said under new york law the jury could award only nominal 
damages or 6 cents per claim on the three claims after awarding 
winters 140000 on the other damage claim chapman said 
judge dennis f harrigan rejected painewebbers request that he 
direct the jury to reject all counterclaims

officials of united states shoe corp say they 
were stunned when merrill lynch capital partners inc pulled out of 
its promise to buy the companys footwear division but an analyst 
says this gives other bidders a chance to make offers 
the market apparently is looking at the failure of the proposed 
4225 million sale as bad news said robert byrne of the advest 
inc securities firm in cincinnati us shoe stock fell 1 a share 
to 1675 in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
my personal opinion is that maybe its not bad news byrne 
said it means that somebody else might buy them the stock has 
been as high as 27 and its trading down near its low it certainly 
would be a better buy down around where it is now 
us shoe a cincinnatibased shoe apparel and eyewear company 
said wednesday that merrill lynch does not intend to consummate the 
previously announced agreement 
merrill lynch and a group of management officials from the 
footwear division announced on feb 27 that they had agreed to buy 
the footwear group and us shoes cincinnati headquarters building 
for 4225 million in cash the deal would have given us shoe the 
right to buy as much as 175 percent of the purchasing 
corporations stock 
merrill lynch a new yorkbased buyout firm decided that 
certain conditions and obligations of the purchase agreement had 
not been satisfied us shoe said without elaborating 
philip g barach us shoe chairman and chief executive 
officer said his company was surprised and disappointed 
we disagree with their position and we believe that we have a 
binding agreement to sell our footwear division we shall continue 
to explore our options with respect to the agreement barach said 
he said us shoe already conducted a thorough auction process 
for the division before reaching the deal with capital partners 
therefore barach said we do not intend to seek out potential 
buyers and would rather operate this proven business 
the collapse of the sale agreement means us shoe will not 
increase its annual dividend from 46 cents to 1 per share as 
previously had been announced 
jerome fisher chairman of the fisher camuto group in stamford 
conn said his company would be willing to pay more than the 
proposed 4225 million sale price but was refused the financial 
information he needed before making a bid us shoe officials said 
they were afraid that a deal with fisher camuto which is a shoe 
importer would violate antitrust laws

union pacific corp will buy back up to 
145 million shares of common stock in a 1 billion repurchase plan 
and sell its realestate subsidiary the company announced thursday 
these actions are designed to enhance shareholder value 
chief executive officer drew lewis said in a statement 
but standard and poors corp said in a statement from new york 
that the announcement had negative implications for the 
companys longterm debt and it was placing the bond and 
commercial paper issues on creditwatch 
the bethlehembased holding company has about 2 billion in 
longterm debt and its omaha nebbased railroad subsidiary has 
900 million sampp said 
union pacific spokesman harvey s turner declined comment on the 
sampp statement issued after the stock markets closed thursday 
the company said its board of directors had authorized the 
buyback offer to begin friday and expire at midnight may 25 the 
board also has authorized spending up to 528 million to buy back 
additional shares in open market or other transactions after the

with a diversified base said robert l decker an analyst with 
duff amp phelps in chicago who added he knew of no potential suitors

trucking real estate natural resources and hazardous waste 
disposal

state commerce commissioner michael hatch late 
thursday blocked oil billionaire marvin davis 27 billion tender 
offer for northwest airlines in minnesota 
the suspension order blocks the estimated 1900 shareholders in 
the state from selling their 13 million shares to davis 
hatch had given davis the option of asking for another hearing 
on the issue which would have been held thursday night but davis 
did not request one by the 5 pm deadline according to lisa 
rotenberg a spokesperson for the commissioner 
in a related development thursday key legislators questions 
about the constitutionality of a proposed antitakeover bill aimed 
at placing roadblocks in the way of suitors for northwest delayed a 
vote on the measure by the senate judiciary committee 
separately nwa inc chairman steven rothmeier said a 
managementled buyout of northwest is not in the works but there 
are as many as four friendly suitors interested in buying the 
airline 
there are a couple of friendly investors out there who could 
do something significant for our shareholders rothmeier said at 
his first news conference since the carrier became the target of a 
hostile 27 billion takeover bid by oil mogul marvin davis 
there are two very strong friendly indications 
rothmeier would not identify the suitors but said he considers 
a previously identified group led by los angeles investor al 
checchi to be a potential white knight checchis group which 
includes former nwa inc director gary wilson holds a 49 percent 
stake in the company 
wilson is a former marriott corp executive and rothmeier is a 
friend of willard marriott the companys chairman said alan 
muncaster a northwest spokesman 
nwa shares jumped 237 a share to 10237 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading remaining above davis 90ashare 
buyout proposal 
rothmeier said management is not pursuing a leveraged buyout and 
has not hired an adviser to explore one although such a 
transaction has not be ruled out in a leveraged buyout investors 
acquire a company mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with 
money raised by the target companys cash flow or the sale of its 
assets 
ten to 15 groups have shown interest in buying or investing in 
the airline and the nwa board has said it would consider all 
serious offers nonpublic information about the airline will be 
available beginning next week to groups who have signed a 
confidentiality agreement 
rothmeier said the board would like to make a final decision as 
soon as possible 
rothmeier repeated an earlier statement that a successful deal 
with friendly suitors was contingent on a closed contract with the 
airlines 5000 pilots rothmeier has urged the pilots to expedite 
negotiations but union negotiators have declined 
an open contract is an invitation to hostile money 
rothmeier said 
if a hostile bidder acquires the airline and opens negotiations 
with the pilots the next offer will look like a twa contract or 
a continental airlines contract rothmeier said pilots at those 
two carriers had to accept concessionary contracts after the 
airlines were acquired 
if the pilots reject such an offer and strike the new 
management would be inclined to say fine i liquidate 
rothmeier said 
jim halvorson a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
said the statements by rothmeier were intended to pressure the 
pilots into concessions 
davis has launched a proxy fight to unseat the nwa board at its 
may 15 annual meeting but rothmeier discounted davis chances of 
winning 
based on the proposal he has out there today i dont think 
hes got a lot of influence in the shareholder vote rothmeier 
said 
the 90 a share davis offer which includes less than 10 percent 
equity would hurt the carrier by loading it with debt rothmeier 
said he also disagreed with davis contentions that he could 
operate the airline profitably with the minimal changes he has 
proposed especially in an economic downturn 
rothmeier also said the value of nwas tokyo real estate has 
been exaggerated davis has said he would consider refinancing or 
selling the real estate which analysts have said could bring up to 
500 million but rothmeier said the japanese government could slap 
a tax of up to 70 percent on the sale and must approve the sale 
price

the house banking committee voted thursday to 
make savings and loan owners put nearly 13 billion more of their 
own money at risk as the price for a 90 billion federal bailout 
but gave them 3 more years than president bush wants to do it 
eleven republicans joined all but four democrats in a 3615 vote 
to delay until january 1995 the june 1991 deadline that bush had 
proposed for sampls to come up with 3 percent hard cash capital 
or 3 for every 100 they lend 
without real capital hard capital the taxpayers have no 
protection from further raids on federal deposit insurance funds 
by imprudent sampl operators said the committees chairman rep 
henry gonzalez dtexas 
action on several weakening amendments was postponed until next 
week nonetheless administration officials hailed thursdays vote 
which doubles the capital requirements of a bill approved by the 
senate last week a major victory for bushs plan 
requiring sampls to put their own capital at risk ahead of the 
taxpayers money is the only way to prevent in the future the 
unsound business practices that contributed to the current 
crisis said treasury secretary nicholas brady 
assistant treasury secretary david mullins told reporters 
afterward that the panels recognition of the need for a 3 percent 
layer of protection between sampl loans that could go sour and 
federal insurance funds was more important than the timetable for 
achieving it 
were happy to have that number up on the board now he said 
the committee later weakened the requirement slightly on a 2624 
vote on an amendment by rep bill mccollum rfla that would 
allow sampls to continue counting as capital their past direct 
investments in subsidiaries engaged in real estate insurance or 
other businesses 
but under the amendment double leveraging of those investments 
in what mullins described as effectively a pyramid scheme to 
support massive quantities of new lending would no longer be 
allowed 
such direct investments by sampls using little or none of their 
own hard cash capital to support skyrocketing loan growth rates 
particularly in texas florida and california have been blamed as 
a major contributor to the thrift crisis 
through such schemes the administration and others have argued 
a portion of the industry was able to lend hundreds of billions of 
federally insured deposits for risky and often fraudulent real 
estate and other ventures 
including interest the taxpayer cost of backing up the federal 
insurance guarantees to depositors whose money was lost is expected 
to be well over 200 billion over the next 30 years under bushs 
bailout plan 
opponents of the plan said many of the nations thrifts would be 
forced out of business or into mergers by rapidly imposing stricter 
capital standards that they argue would require another taxpayer 
bailout in the near future 
if we force institutions by definition to double their 
capital in two years then it will not be the private sector 
that puts it in it may well be the government who puts it in 
said rep john hiler rind 
throgh an amendment by rep bruce vento dminn the committee 
adopted a new capital requirement that the administration has been 
pushing since late last week 
effectively it would require sampl owners to show by 1995 that 
they have 3 of tangible capital in the form of cash or stock 
of their own at risk for every 100 they lend otherwise they 
would be put under a broad measure of government controls 
ventos amendment slightly altered an administrationendorsed 
version by gonzalez and rep chalmers wylie of ohio the 
committees ranking republican it would have required 225 in 
capital for each 100 of loans on an sampls books with bushs june 
1991 deadline 
the new version would give sampl owners an additional 19 months to 
reach the 225 plateau it would also extend until january 1995 
the required tangible capital level asked by the administration 
and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
the administration had praised the senates action last week to 
require sampl owners to put up 150 in capital for each 100 in 
loans they write but it also immediately sought more in the form 
of an amendment to the house version vowing to take the case to 
the taxpayers if its new demand was not met 
opponents however said the new infusions of cash investments 
being demanded as a layer of protection between sampl lending 
practices and the governments deposit insurance funds would drive 
600 to 700 moderately healthy thrifts out of business 
our choice is simple said rep frank annunzio dill do 
we save the sampl industry for the american people who want a 
home or do we sell it out 
but rep toby roth rwis countered that any institution that 
cannot raise its level of capital to 225 for every 100 in loans 
on their books should not be in the business 
if we dont strengthen the capital requirement this is going 
to be a real wimpout he told his colleagues in fact the 
definition of a wimp is going to become someone who serves on the 
house banking committee 
annunzio was the primary author of an amendment approved two 
weeks ago that would require thrift owners within a year to show 
they have 150 in tangible capital such as cash or stock 
easily convertible to cash for every 100 they lend 
while that has been characterized as both toughening and 
weakening bushs original proposal the same figure was adopted by 
the senate but with fewer accounting loopholes that would prevent 
federal regulators from recovering all that amount in the event of 
an sampls failure 
gonzalez likened good will exemptions from hard cash stock 
or other equity capital requirements that the government has 
granted sampls over the last eight years to a soft icecream cone 
in the july sun 
good will provides nothing if the institution goes down he 
said this entire exercise is a sham unless we change the way the 
savings and loans operate we cannot in good conscience require the 
taxpayers to pay out billions of dollars and at the same time tell 
them they must bear all the future risks 
wylie said brady had told him thursday that bush will take 
their case to the taxpayers prior to a vote on the house floor if 
the amendment was not adopted 
according to the federal home loan bank board some 2586 of the 
remaining thrifts nationwide have some form of cash or tangible net 
worth that could be tapped before government insurance funds were 
needed if there was a run on deposits 
but 323 of them with outstanding loans of more than 400 billion 
have below the 15 percent or 150 standard and another 478 are 
now below the 225 percent or 225 tangible capital level 
according to the us league of savings institutions the 
industrys biggest trade organization 
jim grohl a league vice president said the 150 capital 
requirement would force the 323 solvent thrifts now below that 
standard to come up with a total of 92 billion in new capital 
the 225 standard he said would require the 801 institutions 
with less than that now to raise a total of 128 billion over the 
next two years 
the solvent institutions earned only 34 billion last year 
he said since 1980 and during some pretty good times the 
industry has been able to raise only 20 billion in new capital a 
lot of them just arent going to make it

firstquarter profits surged at delta air lines 
and usairs parent company while the parent of united airlines 
said thursday its firstquarter profit on continuing operations 
also increased 
delta said its strong first quarter was only partially a result 
of the strike that virtually grounded rival eastern airlines 
delta said good economic conditions continuing benefits from a 
merger with western air lines and growth in domestic and 
international operations also contributed to the increase 
delta said earnings for the first quarter jumped to 85 million 
or 173 a share from 561 million or 115 a share in the same 
period of 1988 
firstquarter revenue rose 19 percent to 204 billion 
the key to the increased earnings was the 20 percent growth in 
passenger revenues said thomas j roeck senior vice president 
for finance and chief financial officer of delta 
the strike against a major competitor during the month of 
march resulted in increased revenue passenger miles he said 
but traffic growth was strong in january and february prior to 
the strike and in many markets not affected by the strike 
he said passenger traffic increased 13 percent in atlanta one 
of the areas most affected by the eastern strike 
yet traffic for the first three months of the year was up 8 
percent in dallasfort worth 37 percent in honolulu 15 percent in 
los angeles and 10 percent in salt lake city all markets where 
eastern is not a competitor roeck said 
for the nine months ended march 31 delta earned 2701 million 
or 549 a share an increase of 33 percent over the same period in 
the previous year 
ninemonth revenue rose to 578 billion from 504 billion a 
year earlier 
at chicagobased ual corp parent of united airlines profit 
for the first quarter was down sharply due to a onetime aftertax 
gain of 548 million in last years first quarter from the sale of 
its westin hotel unit 
profit for the first quarter totaled 654 million or 303 per 
share down from 5769 million or 1202 per share in 1988s 
first quarter 
but comparing continuing operations mainly the airline uals 
profit rose sharply in the first quarter to 654 million compared 
with the yearago profit of 279 million 
the pershare earnings are not comparable because the average 
number of common shares outstanding used in calculating the 1989 
figure was 216 million compared with 479 million for the first 
quarter of 1988 the difference is due to uals purchase of 355 
million shares of its common stock in march 1988 
revenue for the first quarter totaled 23 billion up from 
206 billion in the 1988 quarter 
ual said passenger miles on united planes were up only slightly 
but the companys yield per passenger increased 18 percent largely 
because of higher air fares 
usair group inc reported earnings of 155 million or 35 cents 
a share in the first quarter compared with a loss of 188 
million a year earlier 
usair had revenues of 148 billion up 18 percent from 125 
billion a year earlier traffic on usair was up 34 percent in the 
period and 8 percent on piedmont which is also owned by the 
arlington vabased airline holding company
