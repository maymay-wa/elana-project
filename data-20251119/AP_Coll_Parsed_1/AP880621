us officials formally inaugurated a 
68mile stretch of road built in a sixmonth project involving 
more than 9000 us soldiers and national guardsmen 
the american troops who started the project dec 28 built a 
road linking jocon a village in rural yoro province and puente 
grande about 200 honduran troops also took part in the project 
honduran and american army and national guard units have held a 
series of joint operations with the us forces being rotated in 
and out of the country for brief periods of duty 
the final report at a ceremony monday marking the conclusion of 
the roadbuilding project said the us troops also assisted 11500 
honduran civilians and 8000 animals in health and veterinary 
programs 
gen frederick woener chief of the us southern command based 
in panama attended the ceremony 
us embassy sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
another roadbuilding exercise is planned in the summer of 1989 to 
build 55 miles of road between jocon and the village of san 
lorenzo 
at least 60 joint military exercises involving us and honduran 
forces have been held in the past six years 
the program began after the reagan administration claimed 
nicaraguas leftwing sandinista regime threatened other central 
american countries

a white housesponsored conference on drugs 
said tuesday that legalization of drugs would be a profound 
mistake and society should instead expand and stiffen measures 
already in use including screening in the workplace and imposing 
the death penalty for trafficking 
such measures would include making the department of defense the 
primary agency for air and sea surveillance of drug trafficking 
extending antidrug policies to every employee in every private 
and public workplace and stiffening mandatory penalties for 
traffickers including addition of the death penalty for drug 
dealers who commit murder 
the us national policy must be zero tolerance for illegal 
drugs said the final report of the white house conference for a 
drug free america established by president reagan last year 
the legalization of illicit drugs is not a solution but 
rather a profound mistake the report said to legalize drugs 
is to make them more readily available and as an inevitable 
consequence more widely used and this is simply unacceptable 
illicit drugs are far too destructive to the health of our citizens 
and the strength of our national character 
included in the more than 100 recommendations are creation of a 
drug czar with cabinet rank increased taxes on beer wine liquor 
and tobacco to finance the antidrug fight and setting up a 
national drug prevention agency 
whether we are family members or coworkers of addicts 
passengers on airplanes or trains piloted by users victims of 
brutal and wanton violence induced by mind altering drugs 
travelers facing the menace of drugged drivers on our highways or 
simply taxpayers we are all victims of illicit drug use said 
lois haight herrington chairman of the conference 
meanwhile the house merchant marine and fisheries committee 
unanimously approved legislation to curb government seizures of 
boats cars and other vehicles under the zero tolerance 
antidrug policy the panel barred the seizures whih have prompted 
many complaints unless theres evidence that the owners or 
operators knew illegal drugs were present 
transportation secretary james burnley called the legislation 
an outrageous action that would gut the policy and 
undermine efforts of his department to keep drugs off boats and 
improve marine safety 
the drug report which herrington will present to reagan next 
week stressed prevention and education and it earned this accolade 
from education secretary william j bennett 
weve heard a million proposals from a thousand people but 
here is a comprehensive tough and practical set of 
recommendations i applaud this report 
more than 5000 people including former addicts entertainment 
and sports figures teachers doctors parents students judges 
and prevention specialists took part in six regional and one 
national conference 
the report said the president should promote a strong 
straightforward easytounderstand policy that prevention is 
essential to rid this country of its drug problem 
this policy must be backed by adequate funds the report 
said 
it called for more spending in the criminal justice system and 
the building of more prisons and said all people in custody should 
be tested for illicit drug use 
penalties should be stiffened to include mandatory minimum 
sentences for drug traffickers those using youths to distribute 
drugs and those selling to youth both adult and juvenile drug 
traffickers should be treated as serious offenders and sentenced 
accordingly 
the drug lords of this world deserve our greatest 
condemnation the conference said but while participants were 
not unanimous on use of the death penalty a clear consensus 
emerged that no other sentence seems to be appropriate 
in the workplace both public and private the report said 
there should be a strong antidrug policy that begins before a new 
employee is on the payroll 
prehire mechanisms should include a clear written statement to 
applicants that they will be subject to a drug test or a physical 
examination that includes drug testing the report said 
the report cautioned that care should be taken so the screening 
will be used only as a mechanism to prevent hiring of drug users 
it also recommended testing for cause when accidents 
absenteeism or abnormal behavior indicate a potential drug problem 
and it advocated random testing whenever there is a need to 
ensure that workers are beyond question fit for safe healthy and 
secure work assignments 
there are specific recommendations for a drugfree 
transportation system and for preventing drugs in sports a 
section on media and entertainment calls for avoiding the 
glamorizing of drug use and for a movie rating system that would 
take drug content into account 
the conference was especially critical of the state department 
for giving the international war on drugs a low priority and for 
assigning law enforcement activities overseas to diplomats

canadian prime minister brian mulroney disclosed 
tuesday that canada expelled a group of soviet diplomats last week 
for improper and unacceptable behavior 
canadian officials said 17 soviet diplomats and trade 
representatives in ottawa and montreal were either expelled or told 
not to return in cases where they had already left the country 
mulroney made the disclosure at a final summit news conference 
when asked about the expulsion by a canadian broadcasting corp 
reporter who sought confirmation that there had been expulsions 
for industrial espionage 
i will confirm the government of canada took some action last 
week in regard to the improper and unacceptable behavior by 
representatives of the soviet government in canada mulroney said 
he said canadian security officers presented the government with 
rather delicate information and certain people were 
expelled 
foreign minister joe clark will make a statement on the action 
in parliament on wednesday mulroney said 
the canadian press news agency quoting unidentified sources in 
ottawa said scientific and technological information was believed 
to be the soviets main target 
the agency said eight of the soviets have left canada since the 
expulsion two of them worked at the soviet embassy in ottawa and 
the others were based in montreal with diplomatic status the other 
nine soviets had left canada in recent months all were declared 
persona non grata and told they could not return 
canadian press said the expulsions appeared to have no 
connection with the arrest last week on spying charges of stephen 
joseph ratkai a nova scotian of hungarian descent ratkai was 
accused under canadas official secrets act with gathering 
classified us military documents from a submarinetracking 
station at argentia newfoundland 
mulroney said that despite the summits endorsement of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms western leaders were under 
no illusions about the soviet union

four women testified tuesday about horrors 
they encountered in a basement torture pit where selfstyled 
minister gary heidnik chained them to pipes raped them and used 
the cooked remains of a victim as a warning 
lisa thomas who was 19 when she was freed from the torture 
chamber in heidniks house more than a year ago said heidnik 
pretended to be a police officer coming to the womens rescue then 
beat his captives when they screamed for help 
heidniks attorneys are using an insanity defense 
ms thomas said she was abducted when she accepted a ride from 
heidnik and returned to his house for sex when she wanted to 
leave he tried to strangle her she said 
ms thomas told the jury chosen in pittsburgh because of 
extensive publicity about the case here that the 44yearold 
heidnik also repeatedly raped his captives 
heidnik is charged with killing sandra lindsay 24 who died 
from asphyxiation while chained to a pipe and debbi johnson 23 
who was electrocuted while standing in a waterfilled pit 
he is also charged with repeatedly raping and torturing ms 
thomas and three others until police released them in march 1987 
surviving victims testified heidnik said he kept them chained in 
the basement because he wanted the women to have his children they 
said they were fed dog food mixed with human remains during their 
captivity 
tuesday josephina rivera testified that heidnik got the idea 
from the black comedy film eating raoul ms rivera who said 
she was a captive for four months before escaping said heidnik 
once took a protesting captive ms dudley upstairs to show her 
body parts as a warning 
she said he had taken her upstairs and shown her sandras head 
in a pot and her ribs in a roasting pan on the stove and her legs 
and arms in the freezer and that if she kept it up thats what was 
going to happen to her ms rivera testified 
jacqueline askins wept as she described the deaths of the two 
women as she left the courtroom and came before photographers she 
began screaming 
common pleas judge lynn abraham called the five photographers 
into court with the jury in recess 
you people dont have any sensitivity at all she said 
banning all cameras from the city hall floor where the trial is 
being held 
during the gruesome testimony heidnik seemed to pay no 
attention he sat in the courtroom staring straight ahead wearing 
the same flowered black hawaiian shirt and baggy trousers he wore 
when first arrested

government spokesman jerzy urban told a 
news conference tuesday he is ready to resign if that would aid the 
cause of national reconciliation 
i think it would be to the advantage of national 
reconciliation if i ceased to be government spokesman said 
urban who has been at his post in the communist government since 
1981 
my role my person and my face are associated mainly with 
political struggle he said 
but he added a final decision depended on his superiors 
i am tied by certain special links of political 
likemindedness loyalty and attachment to the government and in 
view of this the decision that urban should go in my opinion a 
right one cannot be made by urban himself he said 
urban is not a member of the communist party he became 
prominent through televised news conferences and statements in the 
turbulence after solidarity was chartered by the government in the 
fall of 1980 as the only free trade union in the soviet bloc 
solidarity was suspended in december 1981 and subsequently outlawed 
as government spokesman many poles have seen urban as the bearer 
of bad news such as price increases 
he once wrote a column for a satirical publication and also 
worked for the weekly polityka newspaper when communist party 
politburo member mieczyslaw rakowski was the editor rakowski is 
now the partys propaganda chief 
urban has many critics but in 1987 readers of the magazine 
kobieta i zycie woman and life voted him one of their men of the 
year

different from traditional laser beams a neutral particle beam 
has one bigadvantage for sdi use scientists say it can penetrate 
objects and discriminate between real missiles and decoys 
theoretically it can also destroy objects as fast as 10 per 
second in space 
the initial concept actually came from the soviets in the 1970s 
it was picked up at los alamos national laboratory and carried much 
further 
we dont think the opposition has anything like this said 
stan schriber project director this technology wasnt 
understood theoretically until two years ago it had been a mystery 
in the scientific community for 10 years 
in a neutral particle beam a stream of charged hydrogen 
particles receives an added electron then is accelerated to great 
speeds before release the extra electron is stripped out 
creating a neutral beam one unaffected by magnetic fields 
a ground test facility for an npb is under construction outside 
schribers office it will be a prototype for a weapons system 
if the funding stays this could be deployed by the year 
2000 he said

bear a small neutral particle beam machine on a rocket will be 
here next year 
already under contruction at los alamos the 44inchdiameter 
machine will be loaded onto an aries rocket launched from the 
white sands missile range on a suborbital flight and fired 
the primary goal is to take one of these complicated things 
into space its never been done before said kenneth mckenna 
deputy project manager we have to know we can operate in space 
the sdi command has accelerated bears timetable so decisions 
can be made on the most promising technologies mckenna said his 
team is already working nights and weekends 
while schriber works to make a bigger npb machine to prove it 
can be made powerful enough to destroy missiles mckenna tries to 
make it smaller to prove it can work in space the technologies 
would later be merged 
i am very confident it will work when we get it up there he

at the air force weapons lab researchers have combined laser 
beams in a phased array and instead of getting the sum of the 
power of the individual lasers they get much more 
what they envision is a set of seven lasers in space that when 
combined give the power of 49 lasers 
we can make a small laser act as a big one and shoot down 
missiles said air force lt dave russell electrooptics 
engineer you cant manufacture something great big and put it in 
space but you can put up a whole bunch of little ones 
in just four years of sdi work the air force has combined three 
lasers produced the power of nine and moved the beam from target 
to target 
weve got the basic idea in hand russell said its just 
a matter of time before someone makes a decision to deploy or not

pbfa ii is a merrygoroundlike contraption 108 feet wide with 
36 arms arranged around a circular center the sandia national 
laboratories machine is designed to fire an ion beam at a target 
pellet and ignite a nuclear fusion but it has yet to be done 
by creating small nuclear explosions in the laboratory 
scientists say theyll be on the road to making fusion energy 
available for commercial use and being able to test nuclear weapons 
and materials in the laboratory instead of with underground 
explosions 
fusion combining two atoms is the power of nuclear warheads 
fission splitting an atom is the power of old atomic weapons and 
of todays nuclear power plants fusion if ever harnessed in the 
laboratory could yield almost limitless energy without as much 
hazardous waste 
at pbfa ii controllers sit in a small room fashioned after a 
ships bridge with operators at screens labeled commander

we get closer to fusion every day said senior technical 
aide guy donovan

foreign arms sales have been a quiet source of 
funds for chinas military establishment in the 1980s but for the 
government the deals can be a political minefield 
no sooner did controversy die down over chinas surprise sale of 
mediumrange missiles to saudi arabia than reports circulated that 
beijing was selling missile technology to argentina and pakistan 
and that pakistan used the technology to produce a missile capable 
of carrying nuclear warheads which would be a threat to india 
all sides denied the reports but they highlighted chinas 
growing role as an international arms merchant with increasingly 
sophisticated wares and seemingly few scruples about the buyers 
a case in point is chinas muchpublicized sale of silkworm 
missiles to iran after selling fighter planes to irans enemy iraq 
primarily a donor of small arms to african and southeast asian 
revolutionaries in the 1960s china has become the fourth largest 
weapons seller to the third world after the soviet union united 
states and france according to the us government 
china sold an estimated 15 billion worth of weapons in 1986 
and about 2 billion worth in 1987 according to us figures 
china does not release any figures and chinese officials refused 
to discuss arms sales 
china still lags far behind the worlds leading arms seller the 
soviet union which had 1986 sales of more than 15 billion but 
weapons make up an increasing share of chinese exports from less 
than 2 percent in 1978 to more than 5 percent last year 
for that it has mainly to thank the 8yearold iraniraq war it 
has sold 45 billion worth of arms to both sides according to 
us government estimates including the silkworms to iran that 
gave china its first taste of political backlash 
the united states last year briefly halted its program of 
expanding hightech sales to china to show its pique over the 
silkworms with which iran threatens persian gulf shipping china 
insists iran gets the silkworms from someone else 
iran in turn reportedly is unhappy over chinas recent sale of 
css2 missiles to saudi arabia substitutes for us f15 fighters 
that the us congress blocked 
the missiles have a range of 2200 miles and can be fitted with 
nuclear warheads iran with which saudi arabia recently severed 
diplomatic relations is a logical target 
missiles and other sophisticated weapons still account for only 
a small portion of chinas arms sales which consist mostly of 
small arms and field artillery however its tanks and fighter 
planes have become increasingly popular especially since china 
began upgrading them with british and italian technology 
pakistan a regular buyer of chinese aircraft replaces the 
engines in them with british ones 
foreign sources who keep watch on arms deals say sales abroad 
have helped fund weapons development for the chinese military 
whose share of the state budget dropped from 175 percent in 1979 
to less than 10 percent in 1986 as the government puts priority on 
economic development 
but china also is believed to be seeking influence and 
recognition as an important player in world trouble spots even at 
the cost of criticism 
chinas main customers are developing countries embroiled in 
regional conflicts and who dont want to depend solely on the 
soviet union or the united states thailand which buys most of its 
arms from the united states bought an estimated 10 million worth 
of tanks armored personnel carriers and artillery from china last 
year in part as a gesture of independence 
low prices speedy delivery and simple weapons design that can 
easily be maintained by lowtech third world armies are other 
attractions the tanks china sold thailand for example cost about 
200000 each less than onefifth the price of us tanks that 
thailand bought a few months later 
the chinese tanks were delivered within months of order the 
us tanks have yet to arrive

heres a meaty question for students of 
the irish identity crisis is it unchic to speak irish 
bord na gaeilge the state language board has published a 
report suggesting that the irish are losing respect for their 
language and with it their national identity 
while the report names no names the culprits arent hard to 
spot they are irelands rising professionals and entrepreneurs 
the city slickers who think irish is for yokels 
they wouldnt be caught dead speaking irish they would think 
of it as extremely uncool says john doyle editor of in dublin 
a trendy guide to events in the capital 
because irish is spoken mainly in the rural west its 
unfortunately seen as something nonurban unsophisticated as 
something a lot of people perhaps would not like to be reminded 
of he said in an interview 
irish or gaelic as it is sometimes called is the premier 
official tongue and an evocative symbol of irelands struggle to 
free itself of british rule and forge a separate identity 
but english the second official language remains the 
overwhelming favorite among the 35 million irish and only 5 
percent to 10 percent still use irish as their first language 
irish appears on pay phones parking meters road signs and rail 
platforms official titles are irish like taoiseach pronounced 
teeshuck for prime minister aer lingus thanks its passengers in 
irish in newspapers letters to the editor often begin a 
chara which means dear friend 
but usually once the niceties are complete english takes over 
the airline switches to english when pointing out the emergency 
exits and the letters to the editor also are in english 
some would say it was ever thus given 800 years of british 
rule douglas hyde the gaelic scholar and future irish president 
warned in 1891 that the irish language is not dead but it is in a 
bad state of health 
now bord na gaeilge reports irish today as 100 years ago 
appears to be in serious danger of disappearing as a community 
language 
on the one hand it blames xenophobic nationalism and 
vulgarized republicanism for coopting the language to militant 
antibritish causes 
on the other extreme it chastises dominant elites in 
business the media and the professions who still regard irish as 
a lowstatus peasant language and seek a way of escaping 
from an identity of which they perhaps feel obscurely ashamed 
the result says bord na gaeilge is a certain emptiness in 
the way irish people now assert a sense of separate peoplehood and 
perhaps a lack of consensus over whether this is something worth 
asserting at all 
it also sees a decline in traditional irish accents on state 
radio and tv saying many types of hibernoenglish are losing 
respect in ireland as nonirish speech standards are increasingly 
assumed among elites 
some blame the government of eamon de valera a founding father 
of independent ireland and zealous nationalist which in the 1930s 
made irish an obligatory high school subject 
no one could get a high school diploma without passing an irish 
test and no one could join the civil service without a knowledge 
of the language 
the civil service requirement stands as does the high school 
requirement although a passing grade is no longer required 
a lot of people when they think of the irish language think 
of de valera and the way irish is rammed down their throats at 
school said doyle the in dublin editor 
some experts say the preoccupation with irish is holding back 
irelands integration into european markets 
patrick diggins director of a dublin teachers center called 
in a recent speech for a severe jolt of realism he said that 
for the irish to make their way in the european economic community 
we must be fluent in at least two major european languages 
some say the decline of irish is inevitable as the struggle for 
independence fades into history 
the language wrote deaglan de breadun irish language editor of 
the irish times has come to be seen a bit like an aunt who 
seemed such an important person when you were small but now that 
you are grown up you just find her amusing

western leaders saluted president reagan on 
monday for his nuclear arms negotiations with the soviet union and 
encouraged kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev to pursue domestic 
reform saying it could reduce mistrust and build confidence 
the leaders of the seven major industrial democracies also 
endorsed reagans call for tougher action to combat terrorism and 
illegal drug trafficking 
specifically they agreed that once a hijacked aircraft has 
landed in a country it should not be allowed to take off again 
moreover they called for international cooperation to trace 
freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to curb 
money laundering through legitimate banking institutions 
in a separate statement that cited violence on the israeliheld 
west bank the leaders called for a mideast peace conference a 
step which israel opposes 
reagan and the leaders of japan britain france west germany 
italy and canada expressed their positions in a political 
declaration on their second day of talks a final economic 
communique is to be issued at the close of their summit on tuesday 
posing later with his colleagues for a group picture at the 
university of torontos hart house reagan was asked how he felt 
about this being his eighth and final economic summit im going 
to miss them all he said 
the allies then engaged in a forceful discussion over dinner on 
the environment in general and acid rain in particular an issue 
pushed by west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the united states has rejected canadas demand for scheduled 
reductions in the smokestack emissions that cause acid rain 
urging gorbachev to press ahead with more freedom and openness 
in the soviet union the summit leaders promised each of us will 
respond positively to any such developments 
holding out the prospect of increased trade with sovietbloc 
nations the summit leaders said we take positive note of 
eastern countries growing interest in ending their economic 
isolation 
they also urged eastern european nations to improve respect for 
human rights but did not link that issue to an expansion of 
eastwest trade 
officials emphasized a spirit of harmony at the summit and 
played down any differences there was no controversy involved 
here said assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway 
however french president francois mitterrand objected to a us 
proposal for a task force to seek improved cooperation in the 
battle against narcotics mitterrand said the seven summit nations 
should not act as a kind of world directorate with activities 
outside the scope of their annual meeting according to his 
spokesman hubert vedrine 
nevertheless mitterrand chose not to veto the language because 
the fight against drugs is too important for us to block progress 
for whatever reason vedrine said 
reagan said he was pleased with the communique and felt that the 
task force can help us win the war against drugs and were going 
to win 
looking ahead to the final communique treasury secretary james 
a baker iii predicted there would be an agreement on a debtrelief 
plan sponsored by france and britain for subsaharan nations which 
he described as countries that have no reasonable prospect of 
ever getting back on their feet 
unlike other nations which have estimated how much debt relief 
they would grant baker refused to provide a figure for the united 
states 
he cautioned that latin american countries should not interpret 
the action as a sign the united states was relaxing its insistence 
that debtor nations adopt freemarket reforms in exchange for 
further lending by commercial banks and international lending 
institutions 
until recently the united states had been adamantly opposed to 
debt relief for any countries fearing that concessions to the 
poorest countries would encourage big debtors such as mexico to 
expect similar relief 
we have essentially an agreement canadian finance minister 
michael wilson said of the proposals to aid the subsaharan 
nations all we have to do is work out some words of the 
technical agreement 
canadian officials said late monday that reagans call for an 
end to all farm subsidies by the end of the century was still on 
the table 
the situation is delicate said one canadian official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the discussions are very 
intense there may be the possibility of movement and there may 
not 
baker was asked about reports that the west german central bank 
would hike a key interest rate on tuesday by 025 percentage point 
rumors of such a move have sparked fears in financial markets in 
recent days that the major industrialized countries were preparing 
a coordinated round of interest rate hikes as a way of dampening 
inflationary pressures 
however us officials have denied such reports and maintain 
that no round of interest rate hikes is likely even if the west 
germans do increase their repurchase rate which is the rate of 
interest that banks borrow from the west german central bank when 
they use securities for collateral 
baker said the increase was a small one and was not a matter of 
concern 
on eastwest issues the leaders said nuclear weapons and 
conventional forces are the best deterrents to war for the 
foreseeable future 
they hailed the ussoviet treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons inf and said we now look 
for deep cuts in us and soviet strategic offensive arms we 
congratulate president reagan on what he has already accomplished 
along with general secretary gorbachev towards this goal 
however reagan encountered some resistance over the pace of 
negotiations with moscow for cutbacks in longrange missiles 
bombers and submarines 
on eastwest ties the statement said in several important 
respects changes have taken place in relations between western 
countries and the soviet union since we last met 
it credited western strength and unity with fostering the 
evolution 
in the soviet union greater freedom and openness will offer 
opportunities to reduce mistrust and build confidence the 
statement said 
vedrine the french spokesman said the language reflected a 
major change in tone from earlier summit statements you can see 
how far weve come in a few years he said 
tempering the summit statement white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said reagan while optimistic about changes in the soviet 
union was pessimistic about certain aspects of soviet defense 
posture the overall adversarial nature of many soviet policies 
the leaders also welcomed the beginning of the soviet withdrawal 
of troops from afghanistan insisting that it must be total and 
apply to the entire country the afghan people must be able to 
choose their government freely 
the leaders also said the presence of massive soviet 
conventional forces in eastern europe and the strength of the 
warsaw pact forces lie at the core of the security problem in 
europe 
despite the picture of harmony displayed by the leaders there 
were some signs of disagreement noticeably on the issue of

japan died after hanging himself on saturday but details of his 
death were not released until today said a police official who

beef imports i will protest it with my death 
abe owned 50 head of cattle and 247 acres of rice paddies the 
official said iwate prefecture is the fourth largest producer of 
beef in japan 
word of abes death came shortly before the united states and 
japan signed an agreement monday under which japan will nearly 
double its imports of us beef by 1991 
tokyo had sought to avoid opening its market to foreign imports 
in order to protect its own farmers as a major concession the 
us agreed to temporary tariffs to soften the impact under the 
new plan japan will establish tariffs of 70 percent in 1991 60 
percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993

a federal judge on monday agreed to dismiss 
the countrys largest desegregation suit paving the way for an end 
to the 25year battle between the naacp and the nations 
secondlargest school district 
the parties were given 60 days to work out a settlement before 
the decision becomes final 
the action arises out of the recognition that precious 
little can be accomplished to desegregate a school system that 
presently is just barely 17 percent white said district counsel 
peter james 
grover g hankins general counsel for the national association 
for advancement of colored people said he was hopeful negotiations 
would offer some substantial relief to minority students 
the suit was first filed by the naacp in state court in 1963 
and moved to federal court in 1981 
in the mid1960s district enrollment was more than 55 percent 
white today however 83 percent of the districts nearly 590000 
students are from minority groups hispanics at 568 percent form 
the largest ethnic minority group followed by blacks at 177 
percent asians and pacific islanders at 82 percent and american 
indians at 03 percent whites make up 169 percent of the total 
enrollment 
among proposals being considered to enhance opportunities of 
minority students is the expansion of a oneyear pilot program that 
involved overhauling the administration and teaching staffs at 
lowachieving innercity schools that was accompanied by new 
curricula with an emphasis on reading and writing 
some evidence has showed that the changes have brought higher 
test scores james said 
us district judge a wallace tashimas action would end the 
largest desegregation lawsuit in the country after more than 20 
years of costly legal battles 
the naacp alleged that the district illegally discriminated 
against black students through its policies and actions a state 
court ordered the district to reassign and bus students to achieve 
integration from 1978 to 1981 
mandatory busing ceased when voters approved proposition 1 in 
1979 which barred state courts from ordering busing as a remedy 
for segregation 
the antibusing initiative would not prevent a federal court 
from ordering busing however if it found the district in 
violation of federal law 
since mandatory busing ended the district provided a voluntary 
integration approach relying partly on magnet schools which 
offer specialized instruction and which must conform to ratios that 
permit up to 60 percent to 70 percent minority enrollment

the reagan administrations grudging 
enforcement of a 1986 law imposing sanctions on south africa has 
rendered the act ineffective at putting economic pressure on the 
nations apartheid regime says a report by a private legal 
advocacy group 
in a report issued monday the lawyers committee for civil 
rights under law said the administration subverted the laws intent 
by interpreting sections of the statute as allowing infusions of 
money to south africa 
the report also said the administration ignored congress 
direction to enlist allies in imposing a broad trade blockade 
against south africa 
the report was released as the senate foreign relations 
committee prepared to open hearings wednesday on new and stronger 
sanctions legislation a similar bill is expected to come to a vote 
in the full house soon 
both bills would place a virtual ban on us trade and 
investment in south africa within a year backers say the united 
states needs to escalate economic pressure on pretoria to force 
abandonment of its system of official racism 
the legislation is given a good chance of passing in the house 
but is likely to have a tougher time in the senate where it lacks 
the support of moderate republicans who gave the current sanctions 
law crucial backing two years ago the administration opposes the 
bill 
the 1986 sanctions enacted over president reagans veto banned 
importation of south african textiles agricultural products iron 
and steel and coal and uranium they also prohibited new us 
investment and new loans to the south african government 
the lawyers report said the administration has allowed large 
quantities of south african uranium to continue to be imported 
into the united states in spite of the ban allowed ford motor co 
to pour 61 million into a south african company that was taking 
over the automakers operations there and interpreted a ban on 
exports of petroleum products to allow reexport from third 
countries 
concerns that the sanctions would not be fully implemented by an 
administration hostile to their intent have in part been 
realized the report found 
most troubling has been the administrations refusal to seek a 
coordinated strategy with other industrialized countries to 
impose multilateral sanctions the lawyers group concluded 
this failure may have created the greatest limitation on the 
potential impact of the sanctions the report stated 
not only has the administration failed to comply with the 
spirit of the law it has actively worked to subvert and undermine 
the efforts of other nations to achieve precisely the kind of 
multilateral cooperation contemplated by the statute 
gay j mcdougal director of the study acknowledged that 
congress instructions on encouraging multilateral participation 
were merely advisory and not legally binding and that some 
congressional supporters sought to pass a bill that would be more a 
symbolic statement against apartheid than a real economic weapon 
to remedy that shortcoming the group recommended new 
legislation to close many of the loopholes it also recommended a 
series of new sanctions that closely resemble the pending 
legislation sponsored by rep ron dellums dcalif and sen 
edward kennedy dmass

banks that pursue growth for growths sake 
are embarking on a risky course that makes it more difficult for 
them to withstand economic downturn a federal bank regulator says 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke said monday that 
banks that lend conservatively more easily pull themselves out of 
trouble than institutions with overly aggressive behavior 
growth for growths sake or growth without the resources to 
back it up is a highly risky strategy because it leaves the bank 
exposed when the economy turns down clarke said in a speech 
monday night to the american bankers associations stonier graduate 
school of banking in newark del 
in other words when the economic tide goes out you find out 
who is swimming naked clarke said in a text of his speech that 
was released in washington 
clarkes comments came as the office of the comptroller of the 
currency which regulates 4500 nationally chartered banks 
released a report showing that problem banks that later recover are 
more than twice as likely to comply with the instructions of bank 
examiners as are institutions that fail 
the report found that poor policies planning and management 
were about as likely to play a significant role in the failure of 
closed banks as in the decline of banks that later recovered 90 
percent and 88 percent respectively 
however the rehabilitated banks were much more likely to at 
least partially comply with regulators orders 86 percent versus 
41 percent after financial weaknesses are first spotted 
the recovered banks were also more likely to change chief 
executive officers than failed banks 90 percent versus 76 percent 
lee cross a spokeswoman for the comptrollers office said bank 
examiners have taken note of the studys findings by looking more 
closely at the management practices of banks even if they have 
good earnings 
but she said clarke believes the comptrollers office does not 
need additional enforcement power to reduce bank failures she said 
the agency prefers to work with bankers to improve their practices 
rather than adopt a punitive attitude 
the study is being issued as bank and savings institutions 
failures have hit a postdepression high a record 184 commercial 
banks half of them in the oildrilling states of texas louisiana 
and oklahoma were shut down by regulators last year failures 
this year are running at about the same rate 
many sampl failures in particular have been attributed to 
highflyers who pay high interest rates to attract deposits by 
mail from all over the country and then sink the money in highrisk 
real estate deals and oil drilling ventures that later go bust 
in january clarke released the first phase of the study 
examining 171 nationally chartered banks that failed between 1979 
and 1987 it showed that in most cases it took a combination of bad 
management and a poor economy to cause a bank to fail only 7 
percent of the failures were attributed to the economy alone 
the findings raise questions about how banks outside the 
southwest will fare if the national economy enters a recession next 
year or in 1990 as most economists expect 
the second phase of the study released monday compared failed 
banks to 38 healthy and 51 rehabilitated institutions of about 
the same size and in roughly the same areas of the country 
half of the healthy banks studied were in regions with depressed 
economies but they weathered the storm the study said because 
these bankers emphasized profitability and conservative lending 
even at the expense of growth 
the study said 74 percent of the failed banks pursued excessive 
highgrowth strategies while only 16 percent of the healthy banks 
and 40 percent of the declining banks that later recovered had such 
strategies 
in fact all of the banks that dug themselves out of a hole 
abandoned fast growth on their way back up the study showed

crash tests on seven 1988 subcompact 
automobiles show drivers of the dodge colt have the highest 
likelihood of head injury the national highway traffic safety 
administration says 
the colt 4door station wagon produced a headinjury rating of 
1354 on the driver side the agency said monday in releasing test 
results for 10 vehicles 
the previous high among subcompacts tested this year was the 
nissan pulsar nx 2door hatchback which produced a headinjury 
rating of 1134 for drivers 
the headinjury rating based on data recorded by instrumented 
dummies during a 35 mph frontal collision into a fixed barrier 
shows the likelhood of injury to the brain 
so far this year 25 vehicles have been crash tested 
nhtsa said the tests do not result in pass or fail scores but 
provide comparative data for consumers to use in their vehicle 
purchasing decisions when comparing vehicles of similar size and 
weight 
the dummies were wearing seat belts during the test crashes 
nhtsa said new tests for two other subcompacts found the honda 
civic dx 2door hatchback produced a headinjury criterion of 787 
and the daihatsu charade 2door hatchback 768 
other new crash tests and the resulting driver headinjury 
criteria were 
compact cars acura legend ls 4door 435 and nissan sentra 
4door station wagon 1047 
large and midsize cars oldsmobile delta 88 4door 710 and 
volvo 740 gle 4door 519 
trucks vans and multipurpose vehicles dodge d150 pickup 
685 mitsubishi montero 4x4 1320 and nissan nl lev pickup 1528 
only one vehicle of each model was tested and nhtsa said 
further tests on the same type of vehicle could produce different 
results 
the force of the 35 mph test crash equals a headon collision 
between two vehicles traveling at 35 mph or a collision between a 
parked vehicle and a vehicle moving at 70 mph 
previous crash tests on 1988 models produced these headinjury 
criteria 
subcompact cars toyota corolla fx 2door hatchback 593 
toyota tercel 2door hatchback 1005 and volkswagen fox 2door 
1114 
compact cars nissan maxima se 4door 907 peugeot 505 gls

the drought is not expected to have a profound 
effect on the recovery of farmland prices although reduced cash 
flow among farmers may thin out prospective buyers in some hardhit 
areas says an agriculture department economist 
i dont think we would see any particular longterm effect 
said john reilly of the departments economic research service 
drought is a recurring thing in agriculture farmers expect good 
years and bad years when years are good they may forget a little 
bit about the bad ones 
however reilly said that in the heart of severely hit areas the 
drought may well impact land values by discouraging farmers 
from expanding their holdings 
a usda report two months ago showed us farmland values as of 
feb 1 were up 3 percent nationally from a year earlier the first 
annual increase in six years 
reilly said in a recent interview and in a report in the 
agencys agricultural outlook magazine that the patterns of the 
past year indicate that farmland values will increase at about the 
rate of inflation 
the largest uncertainty he said is the direction that farm 
programs will take and their impact on financial returns to owners 
of farmland 
programs authorized by the 1985 farm law are set to expire in 
1990 the programs include a formula for gradually reducing 
commodity price and income supports in hopes of making us crops 
more competitive on the world market and farmers less reliant on 
federal subsidies 
even so federal commodity program costs and payments to farmers 
have been at record levels in recent years direct payments to 
farmers rose to 17 billion in 1987 but are forecast to ease back 
to around 14 billion this year 
the 1985 laws shift to gradually lower supports and target 
prices for major commodities through 1990 may have altered the 
expectations of farmland investors 
thus investors reasonably might expect farm program payments 
to decline and unless they foresee renewed strength in farm 
product markets particularly export markets they will expect 
returns to land to decline as well reilly said 
exports have improved but few analysts expect a quick return to 
the boom years of the 1970s international trade liberalization 
proposed under the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
also injects uncertainty into the outlook 
when uncertainty rises farmers may discount future income 
and make decisions as if they had lowered their expectations for 
returns reilly said 
land values this year may increase modestly again perhaps in 
the range of 2 percent to 4 percent he said 
overall the recovery in the national land market will help 
banks insurance companies and the farm credit system reduce 
inventories of land acquired through foreclosures without adding 
substantial additional losses reilly said 
but potential buyers are likely to be wary about bidding land 
prices up significantly given the uncertainties that lie ahead 
he said 
in its annual review issued on april 14 the usda agency 
reported that farmland values including buildings averaged 564 
per acre up from a 19yearlow of 548 a year earlier 
despite the increase the feb 1 average was still down 32 
percent from the record high of 823 per acre in 1982 
reilly said in his report that us farmland values historically 
showed dramatic swings since national records began in 1850 still 
land prices worked persistently upward after the civil war 
until they spiked during world war i he said 
land values began falling after world war i and were pushed 
lower by the depression of the 1930s reilly said but 
starting in 1945 values rose again climbing with only minor 
interruption for the next 35 years 
government price support programs during the 1950s and 1960s 
contributed to the rise along with world food scarcities and the 
export boom of the 70s he said

to moviegoers shes the lois lane of 
supermans affections but to jesse jackson shes a superwoman 
who has traveled the country this spring as an emissary of his 
presidential campaign 
actress margot kidder devoted the better part of more than two 
months to almost nonstop campaigning for jackson a man she cant 
even vote for because she is a canadian citizen 
kidder lives in the united states along the hudson river 
outside new york and feels strongly about national and global 
politics aside from her acting kidder works with the human rights 
group amnesty international 
jackson she said is a man who is actually standing up and 
saying all the things i always thought the democratic party stood 
for 
jackson has other highprofile celebrity backers among them 
bill cosby disk jockey casey kasem and singer holly near but 
kidder has been the most visible on a regular basis at times 
traveling with the campaign and other times making her way to small 
towns across the country where she was a surrogate speaker for 
jackson 
jackson introduced her from the stage as the campaigns own 
superwoman 
kidder believes she was most effective when she spoke to groups 
as a representative of the campaign often appearing in small 
communities she says her celebrity status might have been the 
initial draw but the jackson campaign was the main attraction 
i feel i was most useful in the small towns and the small 
community meetings where i was out on my own she said in an 
interview i went from coffee shops to rallies you name it 
it was very inspirational 
kidder best known for her role as lois lane to christopher 
reeves clark kent in the movie superman says she has been 
politically active since getting involved in californias nuclear 
freeze movement in the early 1980s 
around that time she first met jackson at a peace rally then 
again briefly on the eve of the 1984 primary in california through 
their mutual friend assemblywoman maxine waters 
that year kidder wanted to write an article for vogue magazine 
about the democrats and followed the preconvention action before 
attending the partys san francisco convention she was attracted 
to jacksons foreign policy issues initially 
i was present at the platform hearings and rules committee 
hearings in 84 and was kind of aghast at seeing the attempts by 
the party establishment to shut jackson out she said 
politicians who agreed with jacksons positions ignored him in 
belief he could not win she said 
she left the convention disillusioned with party politics but 
went on to campaign for liberal democratic congressional candidates 
across the country 
kidder said she found it disconcerting to speak to students who 
were apathetic to politics or were supporting president reagan 
because they wanted to make a lot of money 
she said she dropped out of conventional politics until 
joining the jackson campaign just prior to the april 19 primary in 
new york again she said at the urging of assemblywoman waters 
jacksons state cochair in california 
kidder scoffs angrily at the inevitable campaign plane rumors 
that arise from her working relationship with jackson 
i find it really obscene that people cannot accept that a 
woman who happens to be an actress and relatively attractive cannot 
be accepted within a campaign as a valuable contributor without 
something else going on she said in denying the rumors 
the mother of a 12yearold daughter kidder said she related to 
people she met as a mother and shared the impression jackson had 
made on her with his antidrug message and his integration of 
economic issues with domestic and global policies 
but she said i hardly think jesse jackson needs lois lane 
standing by him to give him credibility 
she plans to go to the democratic convention next month in 
atlanta where she said jacksons constituency has earned the 
right to either be on the ticket or have their issues more than 
paid lip service to in the platform 
her other goal is to cement the jackson coalition the 7 million 
people who voted for him so that it has a firm place within and 
with the democratic party 
kidder says of her work for jackson i go to bed feeling like 
i have done a little bit of meaningful work

michael dukakis is not an unsmiling jimmy 
carter goes the joke dukakis has smiled once or twice 
an editorial cartoonist recently depicted dukakis with a 
mouthful of carterlike teeth and more pointedly dukakis was 
drawn with a trojan horse in the form of a giant peanut 
on the surface there are some similarities between the likely 
1988 democratic presidential nominee and the last democratic 
president 
both are or were governors of mediumsized states both sprang 
to national prominence still strangers to many voters both were 
washington outsiders both came lacking in foreign policy 
experience 
whether the similarities run deeper is being debated 
its probably unfair to both of them because the comparison 
being drawn is designed to put dukakis down said james p 
shenton a columbia university history professor who specializes in 
governors 
the presumption is that somehow carter was a failure he 
said i think carter was a man who as we move away from him may 
prove to be a somewhat better president than we realize 
vice president george bush who as the likely republican 
presidential nominee expects to face dukakis this fall has talked 
up the comparison to carter 
faced with an ominous decline in the polls and sensing hes 
being hurt by recent reagan administration problems bush would 
love to frame the election as a referendum on the carter presidency 
never mind that carters one term ended eight years ago bush 
has been reminding people of the high interest rates high 
inflation and perception of weakness that dragged carter down 
its a tactic ronald reagan successfully used against walter 
mondale in 1984 
it all sounds like jimmy carter reborn bush said recently 
of democratic views 
we dont want to go back to the policies that the liberal 
democrats had under jimmy carter that led us to those days of 
malaise he said on another occasion 
so far there is no sign bush is succeeding in selling the idea 
that 1988 voters should base their decision on 1980 polls suggest 
voters are ready to move on to the postreagan years and are 
looking ahead to this election with interest 
however william schneider political analyst at the 
conservative american enterprise institute argues that there are 
some similarities between dukakis and carter that go beyond the 
superficial 
both democrats he says share an approach to politics that is 
different from that of more traditional democratic candidates both 
are regarded as technocrats who see politics as a matter of 
management rather than reconciling divergent interests 
theyre both problem solvers he said they both are 
essentially running against the interests that run the show in 
washington they both believe that political issues are technical 
issues with right answers and neither one of them has a strong 
political base 
lacking that strong base carter found few supporters when 
things went wrong such as the energy crisis or the iran crisis he 
argues 
reagan by contrast had supporters who stayed loyal through 
such controversies as the irancontra affair 
schneider contends the carterdukakis comparison makes sense to 
voters although they may not be able to put their finger on why 
i think they have an intuitive sense that theres something 
similar between carter and dukakis in their view of politics he 
said theyre both kind of coldblooded smart not gladhanders 
and not comfortable with political give and take 
others dismiss the comparisons 
i dont think its accurate at all said shenton who has 
studied the cases of governors who became presidents carter was a 
more traditional and not particularly innovative governor he 
contends 
dukakis a product of massachusetts political cauldron was a 
reformer who was turned out of office in his own partys primary 
after one term then regained office he appeared changed by the 
trauma of losing 
where the traditional name of the game is patronage he broke 
the rules and in fact he lost his first reelection because he did 
come in as a reformer shenton said hes a person who has been 
innovative in terms of the role of governor and the functions of 
state government 
as for the lack of foreign policy experience and expertise on 
the part of carter and dukakis the same could be said of other 
governors who became presidents shenton cited reagan and franklin 
d roosevelt

a former cia official accused of participating 
in an illegal conspiracy to arm the nicaraguan rebels is the latest 
person charged in independent counsel lawrence e walshs 
broadening irancontra investigation 
joseph f fernandez the cias former station chief in costa 
rica was named monday in a fivecount indictment charging that he 
and unidentified coconspirators deceitfully and without legal 
authorization organized a private arms supply network for the 
contras when congress banned such aid 
fernandez 51 who left the agency late last year after he was 
disciplined by cia director william webster also is charged with 
lying to his superiors to conceal the operation 
in addition he is accused of obstructing an investigation of 
the irancontra affair that was conducted by the presidential 
commission headed by former sen john tower rtexas 
the indictment charges that fernandez lied to the tower 
commission last year by stating that he did not know for a fact 
that fired national security council aide oliver l north was 
involved in aiding the contras 
fernandezs attorney thomas wilson declined to comment on the 
charges saying he needed more time to study them 
each of the five charges carries a maximum sentence of five 
years in prison and a 250000 fine 
the indictment shows that walsh is continuing his grand jury 
investigation even while preparing for the trials of north former 
national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and richard v secord 
the judge in that case gerhard a gesell indicated last week 
he was ready to schedule a trial for north in us district court 
north and his codefendants are to be tried separately on the 
charges they conspired to divert usiran armssale profits 
illegally to the contras 
the case against fernandez was assigned to aubrey e robinson 
jr chief judge of the us district court here 
the grand jurys investigation is ongoing associate 
independent counsel laurence shtasel told reporters after the 
indictment was returned against fernandez 
shtasel also suggested that the 18month term of the special 
grand jury investigating the irancontra affair be extended before 
its scheduled expiration next month 
the indictment charges that fernandez helped north and secord a 
retired air force major general coordinate air drops of weapons 
and supplies to contra groups in southern nicaragua in 1986 
fernandez who operated in the field under the cover name tomas 
castillo also is accused of overseeing the construction of an 
airstrip in northern costa rica that the conspiracy built to help 
deliver arms to the rebels 
the indictment charges that fernandez lied to an official of the 
cias central american task force in september 1986 about the 
purpose of the airstrip and later sent incomplete or unresponsive 
cable messages to the agency in response to cia queries about the 
covert operation 
the cables were designed to conceal the operation when the cia 
questioned fernandez after a c123k cargo plane carrying weapons for 
the contras was shot down over nicaragua on oct 5 1986 the 
indictment says 
the indictment does not identify fernandezs alleged 
coconspirators and prosecutors declined to do so either but a 
list of overt actions taken by the conspirators includes a june 
28 1985 meeting in miami between north secord and contra leaders 
adolfo calero and enrique bermudez 
it notes that fernandez exchanged messages with north and the 
white house aides associate rafael quintero over secure 
communications devices supplied by north 
he also met with robert w owen an associate of north to 
discuss construction of the airstrip the indictment said 
at the behest of north and secord fernandez met with william 
haskell in late 1985 in the costa rican capital city of san jose to 
discuss the operation according to the indictment 
haskell a former marine colleague of norths who went by the 
pseudonym robert olmsted helped negotiate the purchase of the land 
for the airstrip according to the report of the congressional 
investigation of the irancontra affair 
fernandez is accused of helping north and secord coordinate air 
drops of arms to the contras in april 1986 and participating in 
eight subsequent deliveries of weapons and supplies that year at 
the time congress had banned direct us military aid to the 
contras 
he is accused of lying to the cias inspector general office on 
jan 11 1987 by stating that the airstrip was built by the costa 
rican government to train fighters for a possible invasion by 
nicaragua 
the indictment charged fernandez also falsely told the tower 
commission that he did not know the supplies he helped deliver the 
contras in september 1986 included weapons and ammunition 
fernandez told the congressional irancontra committees that the 
operations were authorized by cia officials but he admitted that 
he misled both the tower commission and the cias inspector 
general actions he said he thought were within the guidelines 
set by clair george the agencys deputy director for operations 
who retired last year 
fernandez was one of several cia officers disciplined by webster 
last december wilson said his client resigned from the agency 
asked if he disputed press reports that fernandez had been 
fired wilson said maybe yes maybe no it depends on the 
perspective you take

here is the text of the political statement 
issued monday by the leaders of the seven largest industrialized 
democracies at their economic summit 
we the leaders of our seven countries and the representatives 
of the european community uphold common principles of freedom 
respect for individual rights and the desire of all men to live in 
peace under the rule of law our peoples stand in solidarity within 
the framework of our existing alliances for the cause of freedom 
to safeguard democracy and the prosperity which it has produced in 
our discussions we considered how these goals and values could be 
pursued in the field of foreign affairs particularly with regard 
to eastwest relations 
we discussed a wide range of regional questions and these 
discussions are continuing throughout the summit 
we confirmed our belief in constructive and realistic dialogue 
and cooperation including ams control human rights and regional 
issues as the way to build stability between east and west and 
enhance security at lower levels of arms we also reaffirmed that 
for the foreseeable future nuclear deterrence and adequate 
conventional strength are the guarantees of peace in freedom 
in several important respects changes have taken place in 
relations between western countries and the soviet union since we 
last met for our part this evolution has come about because the 
industrialized democracies have been strong and united in the 
soviet union greater freedom and openness will offer opportunities 
to reduce mistrust and build confidence each of us will respond 
positively to any such developments 
we welcome the beginning of the soviet withdrawal of its 
occupation troops from afghanistan it must be total and apply to 
the entire country the afghan people must be able to choose their 
government freely each of us confirms our willingness to make our 
full contribution to the efforts of the international community to 
ensure the return of the refugees to their homeland their 
resettlement and the reconstruction of their country we now look 
to the soviet union to make a constructive contribution to 
resolving other regional conflicts as well 
since our last meeting progress has been made between the 
united states and the soviet union in agreeing to reduce nuclear 
weapons in a manner which accords fully with the security interests 
of each of our countries the inf treaty the direct result of 
western firmness and unity is the first treaty ever actually to 
reduce nuclear arms it sets vitally important precedents for 
future armscontrol agreements asymmetrical reductions and 
intrusive verification arrangements we now look for deep cuts in 
us and soviet strategic offensive arms we congratulate president 
reagan on what he has already accomplished along with general 
secretary gorbachev towards this goal 
nonetheless the massive presence of soviet conventional forces 
in eastern europe the ensuing conventional superiority of the 
warsaw pact and its capacity to launch surprise attacks and 
largescale offensive operations lie at the core of the security 
problem in europe the soviet military buildup in the far east is 
equally a major source of instability in asia these threats must 
be reduced our goal is enhanced security and stability at lower 
levels of forces after having eliminated the present imbalances 
we seek the early establishment of a comprehensive effectively 
verifiable and truly global ban on chemical weapons 
genuine peace cannot be established solely by arms control it 
must be firmly based on respect for fundamental human rights we 
urge the soviet union to move forward in ensuring human dignity and 
freedoms and to implement fully and strengthen substantially its 
commitments under the helsinki process recent progress must be 
enshrined in law and practice the painful barriers that divide 
people must come down and the obstacles to emigration must be 
removed 
we pay special attention to the countries in eastern europe we 
encourage them to open up their economies and societies and to 
improve respect for human rights in this context we support the 
continuation and strengthening of the helsinki process 
we take positive note of eastern countries growing interest in 
ending their economic isolation for example in the establishment 
and development of relations with the economic community eastwest 
economic relations can be expanded and serve our common interests 
so long as the commercial basis is sound they are conducted within 
the framework of the basic principles and the rules of the 
international trade and payments system and are consistent with 
the security interests of each of our countries 
we strongly reaffirm our condemnation of terrorism in all its 
forms including the taking of hostages we renew our commitment to 
policies and measures agreed at previous summits in particular 
those against statesponsored terrorism 
we strongly condemn recent threats to air security in 
particular the destruction of a korean airliner and the hijacking 
of a kuwaiti airliner we recall the principle affirmed in previous 
declarations that terrorists must not go unpunished we appeal to 
all countries who are not party to the international conventions on 
civil aviation security in particular the hague convention to 
accede to those conventions 
we express support for work currently under way in the 
international civil aviation organization aimed at strengthening 
international protection against hijackings we welcome the most 
recent declaration adopted by the icao council which endorses the 
principle that hijacked aircraft should not be allowed to take off 
once they have landed except in circumstances as specified by the 
icao declaration 
we welcome the adoption this year in montreal and rome of two 
international agreements on aviation and maritime security to 
enhance the safety of travelers 
we reaffirm our determination to continue the fight against 
terrorism through the application of rule of law the policy of no 
concessions to terrorists and their sponsors and international 
cooperation 
the illegal use of drugs and illicit trafficking in them poses 
grave risks to the peoples of summit countries as well as the 
peoples of source and transit countries there is an urgent need 
for improved international cooperation in all appropriate fora on 
programs to counter all facets of the illicit drug problem in 
particular production trafficking and financing of the drug 
trade the complexity of the problem requires additional 
international cooperation in particular to trace freeze and 
confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to curb money 
laundering 
we look forward to the successful negotiation in vienna in 
november of a united nations convention on illicit trafficking 
we supported the initiative of the government of the united 
states for a special task force to be convened to propose methods 
of improving cooperation in all areas including national bilateral 
and multilateral efforts in the fight against narcotics

to commuters it was inconvenient for 100 
political fringe groups it led to the rally of a lifetime but to 
the growing subculture of street people in canadas richest city 
the sevennation economic summit was irrelevant 
i dont really understand it are they trying to make more 
money said a 17yearold girl with a mohawk haircut who was 
panhandling for change monday opposite the eaton center a 
glittering mall on torontos main drag yonge street 
ive been out on the streets for three years said the girl 
who identified herself as sally i dont even understand the 
summit 
a few blocks east young people slept on plastic sheets and 
blankets in allan gardens which like many toronto parks provides 
temporary haven in a city with a booming economy but the worst 
housing shortage in the country 
its a side toronto wants to cover up and ignore said the 
rev rudy mumm an oblate missionary who works with the citys 
estimated 15000 street people 
were outraged that such a big todo is made and all this 
money spent when you have people who are dying in the streets in a 
city thats so prosperous mumm said 
the average price of a house in toronto is 186750 and the 
rental market is so tight there is just one vacancy for every 1000 
apartments the waiting list for the few governmentsubsidized 
units is three years 
toronto mayor art eggleton was delighted when prime minister 
brian mulroney picked the ontario capital to host the 14th economic 
summit he welcomed the 16 million expenditure and said it would 
boost tourism and investment and publicize torontos bid for the 
1996 olympic games 
but people who had to go to work in the offices of the citys 
financial bay street district adjacent to summit headquarters in 
the metropolitan toronto convention center viewed the summit 
differently 
up to 15 blocks at a time were closed as a motorcade carrying 
president reagan or british prime minister margaret thatcher 
whisked past and parking was at a premium with daylong rates 
hiked from 650 to 10 
for all that anticipated rushhour traffic jams never 
materialized many people simply took the day off from hot dog 
vendors to cab drivers most people went about their business 
unaffected by the highpowered discussions nearby 
but the citys parochial anglosaxon origins once brought it 
the nickname toronto the good and that earnestness surfaced 
during the summit 
while many of greater torontos 34 million people waved 
cheerily as police guided summit limousines through their 
neighborhoods a loose alliance of 100 political groups used the 
event to promote causes as diverse as abortion and starving 
somalian children 
in a 1960s atmosphere of protest songs long hair and 
antiestablishment tshirts about 1500 people gathered at a sunny 
sunday afternoon rally under the theme people before profits 
but when they tried to march to the summit to deliver a 
citizens warrant charging the leaders with crimes against 
humanity an army of uniformed and swat team police blocked their 
way made more than 100 arrests and cleared the street in an 
aggressive armtoarm charge backed by officers on horseback 
onlookers said they never thought they would see such police 
tactics in normally peaceful toronto where crosswalk lights are 
obeyed and litter is a surprise 
i was shocked said robert bruckner a university of toronto 
student who helped organize antisummit protests weve never 
seen anything like that in canada before 
an academic challenge to the world leaders came from the summit 
citizens conference at ryerson technical institute where hundreds 
of concerned torontonians paid 5 to hear lectures on ethical 
investing growth without pollution and alternative strategies 
for full employment 
the citys basic poverty action group organized tours of the 
real toronto to show visiting media aspects of the city invisible 
from their downtown hotels 
they looked at lowcost apartment buildings being converted into 
luxury condos at hostels feeding the poor for 50 cents each and 
food banks helping 3000 people a day and at storefront cashiers 
that charge welfare recipients 15 percent to cash their checks 
it may sound like a land of milk and honey but many people 
cant get a place to live and end up on the streets said frank 
pimentel of the downtown christian workers association 
they should spend more bucks on that problem rather than 
throwing a party at the toronto convention center people will 
never forget this summit

when mikhail s gorbachev holds his communist 
party conference in moscow next week he will have for better or 
for worse the support of president reagan and his partners at the 
economic summit 
gorbachevs effort to reconstruct the soviet economy is 
encountering a lot of resistance but he now can tell skeptics that 
he is winning friends and the promise of more trade from the 
west 
the promise is contained in the political declaration issued 
monday by president reagan and his six summit partners they also 
urged gorbachev to expand human rights 
we confirmed our belief in constructive and realistic dialogue 
and cooperation the declaration said it was based on the 
individual observations of the seven leaders and a report reagan 
gave at dinner sunday night of his talks with gorbachev in moscow 
in his three years in power gorbachev has worked hard to 
convince the west that he is interested in conciliation he has 
promoted arms control as one way to ease tensions and released 
scores of political prisoners to establish his credentials as a 
soviet leader determined to break with the past 
by easing tensions gorbachev gets a respite from the arms race 
and a chance to divert the money and energy he saves into the 
soviet economy 
the threepage declaration cautioned gorbachev and east european 
leaders that expanded trade would have to be economically sound and 
consistent with the security interests of the seven 
industrialized democracies 
more to the point though it lauded gorbachev for 
perestroika and for improving human rights and said the west 
would respond to this evolution in a positive way 
greater freedom and openness will offer opportunities to 
reduce mistrust and build confidence reagan and his six partners 
declared each of us will respond positively to any such 
developments 
the leaders welcomed the onset of a soviet troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan and the progress in reducing nuclear weapons since the 
last economic summit meeting in venice italy a year ago 
in several important respects changes have taken place in 
relations between western countries and the soviet union since we 
last met the statement said 
for a group of six capitalists and one socialist president 
francois mitterrand of france the approval and encouragement to 
the communist leader reflected the growing accommodation between 
east and west 
at past summits the seven leaders were inclined to sharply 
criticize the soviets the statement issued monday at reagans 
final economic conclave found several items to criticize 
including a military buildup in the far east and the massive 
presence of soviet ground troops in eastern europe 
these threats must be reduced the statement said 
but its overall thrust was positive 
mitterrands spokesman hubert vedrine said the declaration 
reflected a major change from the statements issued at the 1985 and 
1986 summits 
the tone is not the same he told reporters you can see 
how far weve come in a few years 
reagans summit meeting with gorbachev in moscow apparently was 
the clincher 
according to his spokesman marlin fitzwater the president was 
pessimistic about certain aspects of the defense posture and the 
overall adversarial nature of many soviet policies 
and the white house official said he did remind the group 
that the soviet union remains a controlled society 
but the bottom line is that reagan who built a political career 
running against communism and big government approved of gorbachev 
the president feels general secretary gorbachev is a leader we 
can do business with that he is serious about reforms in a number 
of areas economic and social fitzwater said 
when the soviet communist party opens its conference on june 28 
the first such session since 1941 the endorsement gorbachev 
received from reagan and the leaders of canada britain france 
italy japan and west germany will at least reassure the 
rankandfile within the soviet union that the west is with their 
leader

president reagan stood in front of the rising sun 
banner of japan to salute the signing of a new usjapanese 
agreement on science and technology but not without a flap about 
whose flag went where 
as spectators and journalists gathered in a hotel ballroom to 
view mondays signing ceremony at the sevennation economic summit 
the american flag stood at the right of the bandstand and the 
japanese on the left 
about 20 minutes before the ceremony was to start two japanese 
came out from backstage picked up the flags base and all and 
swapped them 
that was where matters stood for several minutes then two 
americans came out picked up the flags and put them back where 
they were to begin with 
after japanese and american aides conferred in an aisle the 
flags were left as the americans had put them 
a us official speaking on condition he not be identified 
explained the goingson this way 
the white house maintained that for protocol reasons the 
american flag should be on the right at the ceremony for which 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita came to the hotel where 
reagan is staying 
the japanese however took the position that the flag of japan 
should be on the right side because that was where takeshita was 
to sit as the two leaders signed the treaty in any event the two

summit is not a member of the irish republican army terror group 
michael derek collins was arrested saturday for overstaying a 
onemonth visa issued to him last year police in ireland said

but police here said collins is only being held pending an 
immigration hearing and that no criminal charges are being brought 
against him

stifling temperatures are adding to the 
droughtinduced misery in parts of america but even the 104degree 
record set in lincoln neb is 30 degrees short of the national 
alltime high 
record highs recorded in the midwest and plains this week 
include sundays 104 degrees at lincoln breaking a record of 103 
for the date set in 1974 95 degrees in alpena mich topping the 
92degree mark of 1964 and 103 in sioux city iowa beating the 
99degree record set in 1933 and 1953 
the highest official reading in the united states was set july 
10 1913 in death valley calif when the thermometer reached 134 
degrees fahrenheit 
death valley has the perfect conditions for setting heat 
records low elevation in an already warm area clear skies and 
subsiding air on the lee side of mountains geographer david h 
hickcox says in weatherwise magazine 
even so it seldom reaches the sweltering heights of the 130s 
rarely exceeding 127 degrees hickcox reports but it is steadily 
hot with the daily high falling below 105 only once during june of 
1987 for example 
while death valley gets the attention however high temperature 
records of more than 100 degrees have been set in every state at 
one time or another 
even seemingly frigid alaska has managed the century mark 
recording 100 degrees at fort yukon on june 27 1915 
that ties hawaii where the 100degree record was set at pahala 
on april 27 1931

from the dry spell that threatened the 
pilgrims corn crop in 1621 to the devastating droughts on the 
great plains in the 1880s and 1930s lack of rain has been a 
periodic plague in america 
of the many natural forces that wage war on farmers and 
ranchers the most demoralizing is a prolonged drought president 
dwight eisenhower said during the 1950s drought in its grip the 
individual farmer is wellnigh helpless 
perhaps the worst instances of drought in american history dried 
out the plains both 50 and 100 years ago and hit the southwest in 
the 1950s 
whether the current drought will match the disasters of the past 
remains to be seen but a look back shows it is not unique 
firmly fixed in american memory is the dry time in the 1930s 
which coincided with the economic chaos of the great depression 
the plight of homeless farmers heading west was recounted in 
books such as john steinbecks the grapes of wrath the term 
okies for those who fled oklahomas parched farms became 
attached to millions of americans displaced from the land 
in many respects the era was an echo of the 1880s 
twenty years of good rainfall ended in 1881 and the dry spell 
held on until 1887 launching an exodus of farmers from kansas and 
nebraska 
in god we trusted in kansas we busted was a popular saying 
of the time according to weather historian david ludlum one 
writer of that era estimated that half the residents of western 
kansas had departed by 1892 and dry summers from 189395 didnt 
ease the misery 
both of these earlier droughts followed wet periods that had 
encouraged increased settlement cultivation of land and 
overgrazing 
each drought period set in motion an emigration that grew into 
a rout in both cases the series of rainy years had been mistaken 
for normal climate with disastrous results the department of 
agriculture reported in 1941 
by some accounts the drought of the 1950s was as bad as those 
before and records of lengthy dry spells threatening american 
crops date back to 1621 and the pilgrims 
the dry spell that threatened the pilgrims crops lasted just 24 
days ludlum reported in the american weather book but drought 
threatened again in 1623 killing the corn crop 
eastern new england suffered severe dryness in 1749 and again in 
176162 when fields of grain caught fire and even homes were 
burned there were dry years also in 1805 and 1822 
drought threatened crops from new york to missouri in 1854 
while dryness led to searing dust storms in newly settled kansas in 
1860 
then came the two decades of rainfall that encouraged settlement 
of the plains and set the stage for the disaster of the 1880s 
here is a look at some of the other droughts that have affected 
the united states 
the 1950s was a time when dust storms once again swirled across 
dry land on the plains tree ring studies conducted by the 
university of arizona indicate that the 1950s decade was the driest 
period in the southwest in 700 years 
in kansas twothirds of the states farmers had to find 
offfarm jobs and by 1957 people were leaving farms at the rate of 
4000 a day 
it was the northeast that suffered from drought in the 1960s 
major cities faced shortages with reservoir levels falling to 
record lows in the driest period in 160 years 
forest fires swept large areas washing cars and watering lawns 
became illegal and diners had to ask for water at even the most 
posh eateries wells failed leaving farmers without water and the 
level of the great lakes dropped alarmingly 
drought was felt at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s in the 
southwest and in florida raising dust storms in texas and leading 
to grass fires even in the everglades swampland 
california was the victim of drought in the later 1970s 
suffering its driest year on record in 1977 water rationing was 
implemented and farmers lost an estimated 24 billion

defense consultant william galvin one of the 
38 subjects of fbi search warrants in the pentagon fraud 
investigation has a wide variety of ties with other people and 
companies named in the probe 
fbi agents last week scoured galvins office in the watergate 
complex where melvyn paisley the former assistant secretary of the 
navy identified as a key figure in the 2yearold investigation 
also has his office 
federal agents also looked at the office of galvins stepson 
ken brooke of vienna va 
no arrests have been made in the fraud case which involves 
allegations that defense contractors used consultants to obtain 
confidential defense department information bribes were paid to 
people inside the pentagon officials claim 
galvin whose business is named athena associates and paisley 
both worked as consultants for united technologies corp a large 
defense contracting firm based in hartford conn 
galvin is a consultant to norden systems while paisley works for 
pratt amp whitney both norden and pratt amp whitney are divisions of 
united technologies 
the hartford courant has put the relationship even closer 
when paisley was with the navy galvin was a conduit to him 
the newspaper quoted a source as saying they had a 
relationship paisley who resigned from the navy in april 1987 
was a close associate of john lehman jr the former navy secretary 
efforts to contact the men were unsuccessful galvin was not in 
his office said a man who answered the telephone all calls were 
referred to his attorney william nussbaum who did not return a 
call paisley did not answer his telephone brooke declined to talk 
about the investigation 
larry bingaman a utc spokesman said the company had a policy 
of not divulging information about consultants norden manufactures 
military radar and communications equipment pratt amp whitney makes 
aircraft engines 
galvin has three other clients that were the subjects of fbi 
search warrants last week they are loral corp unisys corp and 
cubic corp according to published reports 
galvin had another relationship with a firm on the list of 
companies investigated by the fbi he was director of armtec inc 
of palatka fla according to records on file with the florida 
secretary of state 
armtec a small 80person firm that manufactures wiring 
harnesses is located in the congressional district of rep bill 
chappell dfla chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee 
on defense 
chappell is reportedly under scrutiny in the nationwide inquiry 
but he has denied any wrongdoing and called the reports a bunch 
of bunk 
the florida democrat however said he was instrumental in 
getting armtec to move to the states 4th congressional district in 
1986 because the companys president william roberts is a close 
personal friend 
roberts who has a house in alexandria va as well as in 
florida said in a statement that the company intends to 
cooperate fully with the government in its investigation though 
it has done nothing wrong 
friends of galvin said he and his wife evelyn recently moved 
from an exclusive area in mclean va where former cia director 
stansfield turner was a neighbor to the watergate apartment 
complex 
they were wonderful people said mrs robert kimberly a 
friend the couple entertained frequently as part of their active 
social life acquaintances said 
galvins daughter joan works on capitol hill as a legislative 
aide to rep andy ireland rfla she coordinates irelands work on 
the house armed services committee according to his spokesman 
doug hattaway 
hattaway said ms galvin joined the congressmans staff 18 
months before ireland was appointed to the powerful panel 
cbs news reported monday night that ireland is among a few house 
members who are under scrutiny in the case but that there is not 
yet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation 
henry hudson the us attorney who is coordinating the 
investigation from alexandria va said 270 subpoenas have been 
issued and that additional search warrants may be issued 
some of the 38 search warrants under seal in the probe from last 
week may be opened to the public by the end of this week he said

food and drug administration commissioner 
frank young says academic researchers are choosing to stay at home 
for the big bucks in research grants instead of volunteering to 
help the government respond to the aids crisis 
in a speech at a conference of the american association for the 
advancement of science young said monday he believed the 
academic community has markedly failed in the aids problem 
university researchers he said are being irresponsible 
because they want to stand on the sidelines and grab the big bucks 
instead of taking the heat of helping to make aids policy 
decisions in washington 
young 56 said scientists from his generation felt an 
obligation to contribute time to government service and that he 
gave up a laboratory with 2 million in research grants to take on 
his government job 
most academic researchers now he said refuse to give any time 
to the government even as the nation confronts what young called 
an extremely serious disease in acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
young said the fda is attempting to hasten the approval process 
needed to put new aids drugs on the market but he said there is a 
shortage of the experts needed to evaluate drug applications and 
testing results 
right now he said there are 162 drugs being evaluated but the 
agency has only 127 people available to sift through applications 
that may include 100000 pages 
without the help of experts from academic laboratories said 
young the process will be slowed 
the commissioner said he repeatedly has asked academic 
researchers to spend two years in government service at their same 
academic salary to help battle aids but he said they dont 
want to leave their laboratories i see very few people willing to 
pay the price 
officials at several major research institutions declined to 
comment on youngs statements although martin hersch a harvard 
university researcher said it still is common for scientists to 
spend several years early in their careers in government 
laboratories such as those at the national institutes of health and 
the centers for disease control 
young said of the 162 aids drugs now in some phase of evaluation 
and testing by his agency three are vaccines tests of the 
vaccines he said are at least two years away and when those tests 
do occur its going to be horrible 
he said there is no laboratory animal that can be used to test 
aids drugs and the vaccines will have to be tested on human 
patients this means dangerous side effects usually detected in 
animal tests will be found instead among the human test subjects 
also young said only half of the aids patients being tested 
will receive the vaccine and the rest will receive a placebo since 
aids is thought to be 100 percent fatal he said those receiving 
the placebo will not survive 
young said the vaccine testing probably will have to take place 
in african countries where the rate of aids infection is far more 
serious than in the united states french researchers he said 
probably will start testing a vaccine in zaire sometime next year

financial institutions offering home equity 
loans would have to provide consumers with detailed descriptions of 
the terms before requiring any nonrefundable fees under 
houseapproved legislation now headed for the senate 
house banking committee chairman fernand j st germain dri 
said the bill approved on a house voice vote monday would put 
an end to carnivaltype advertising that lures homeowners into 
deals they cant afford 
the legislation would prohibit misleading advertising and place 
a series of new consumer protections on the loans which have 
increased in popularity because of tax advantages under the income 
tax overhaul enacted in 1986 
the legislation also includes requirements that lenders base 
variable rates on publicly available indexes outside of their own 
control and it prohibits them from requiring speededup payments 
unless the customer is at fault 
the bill was sent to the senate which has already approved 
similar legislation as part of broader banking legislation the two 
chambers must agree on identical bills before the legislation goes 
to the president 
an industry spokeswoman said bankers hoped to win changes in the 
bill before final passage 
we support the concept of the bill and we look forward to 
working with congress to pass a bill that fully balances the needs 
of consumers and creditors said maryliz meany of the american 
bankers association who said her group considered the legislation 
too complex 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the consumer 
subcommittee of the house banking committee said the measure is 
needed because people are rushing to use home equity loans because 
of their continued taxdeductibility 
they might be the fastest growing craze since the hula hoop 
he said 
surveys of banks and other lenders indicate home equity credit 
lines have grown steadily over the past two years and are expected 
to grow another 40 percent this year ms meany said 
in 1985 the public owed 20 billion in home equity loans out of 
150 billion in all second mortgages by the end of 1987 there 
were 64 billion in equity loans out of about 200 billion in 
second mortgages she said

a district judge sent a teenager back to 
jail for failing to reveal the whereabouts of her pet ferret fuji 
which authorities fear might be rabid and may have bitten a 
5yearold boy 
nineteenyearold jennifer au who hid her ferret to protect it 
from decapitation in a rabies test claims she doesnt know its 
whereabouts because she arranged to have it picked up at an 
abandoned house by an anonymous person who volunteered safe haven 
but prince william county circuit judge percy thornton jr on 
monday told ms au you will sit in the jail until whoever brings 
in the ferret 
it is now the 20th of june and still no ferret you will go to 
jail today he declared 
i dont know how im supposed to find the ferret if i am 
sitting here in jail ms au said after she was taken to the 
prince williammanassas regional adult detention center 
the ferret flap has simmered since june 3 when 5yearold 
austin jacob simpson of nearby dale city was bitten by a ferret 
during a visit to a pet store 
ms au who worked at the pet store at the time said she saw 
the incident and that her pet did not bite the boy the other two 
ferrets were tested for rabies a process which involves killing 
the animal and examining its brain tissue and were found not to 
be rabid 
ms au has been charged with concealing her ferret to prevent 
its destruction or confinement and on thursday she was cited for 
contempt and given 12 hours to produce the animal 
the deadline later was extended until monday morning when 
thornton ordered her jailed indefinitely for failing for produce 
the ferret a weasellike animal 
auston meanwhile has undergone four of six rabies 
inoculations which doctors say could have serious side effects on 
someone so young his mother sandy lee said she didnt understand 
how someone could have a perspective so wrong as to put an animal 
before a child 
judge thornton told au during mondays hearing if it were in 
this courts power i would put you through the same thing this 
child is going through 
ms au had been jailed for three hours last thursday after she 
shouted at the judge during a court hearing after her return to 
jail on monday ms au said this is extremely stupid and 
ridiculous needless this has gone too far 
au said she wants the ferret returned but that she could turn 
up no information on fujis whereabouts in her contacts with ferret 
groups and others 
meanwhile assistant commonwealths attorney wenda travers said 
that her office received a call friday from someone who identified 
himself as smith and said he had the ferret and would return it 
once the pressure is taken off au

michael dukakis dismissing george bushs 
criticism of a massachusetts inmate furlough policy said the 
federal government and most states have such programs and that 
president reagan supported furloughs when he was california 
governor 
these are part and parcel of all kinds of responsible 
corrections programs the massachusetts governor and probable 
democratic presidential nominee said monday 
dukakis who celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary monday was 
traveling to california today he was addressing the national 
convention of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees and aides said he would also meet with jackson 
at a luncheon of national broadcast executives on monday 
dukakis was asked about bushs weekend criticism of the 
massachusetts furlough policy particularly a case in which a 
convicted murderer escaped while on furlough and raped a maryland 
woman 
dukakis said nearly all states have furlough programs and that 
16000 federal inmates were granted furloughs last year the 
governor did not mention however that most states do not grant 
furloughs to murderers 
they not only give them weekend furloughs they give 30day 
furloughs dukakis said of the federal system 
ronald reagan had a furlough program as governor of 
california he said 
bob gore spokesman for the california department of 
corrections said thengov ronald reagan terminated a work 
furlough program after a convicted armed robber and a convicted 
forger on work furlough robbed a couple in orange county in 1972 
killing one of the robbery victims 
as a result the program was terminated by the reagan 
administration and the deputy director in charge of the parole 
division was fired gore said 
since then gore said the only work furlough program for 
california inmates is part of the transition program for inmates 
about to be released and is limited to those who have not 
committed violent crimes 
bush the vice president and likely republican presidential 
nominee has been trying to portray dukakis as soft on crime by 
pointing to the governors opposition to the death penalty and 
playing up the furlough controversy 
dukakis initially stood behind furloughs for those convicted of 
murder but later agreed to change it so inmates serving life 
sentences would not be eligible 
on monday he repeated his opposition to the death penalty which 
he opposes on philosophical grounds and said there was no evidence 
that capital punishment was a deterrent to drugrelated crime he 
also cited declines in his state in the crime rate and drug use 
among students 
the proof of the pudding is in the eating dukakis said 
this is not an accident i go to the people on this issue with a 
record 
dukakis reiterated his plan to name a cabinetlevel drug czar 
and said reagan administration antidrug efforts have failed 
because of a lack of leadership from a committee reagan named to 
coordinate such programs 
there is nobody in charge he said there is nobody 
accountable the chairman of the committee is attorney general ed 
meese nuff said 
dukakis was asked about how he would deal with supporters of 
jesse jackson who believe jackson should be offered the no 2 spot 
on the democratic ticket 
i dont see that as a problem he said i think we are 
going to be very much together 
he said he had the luxury of several weeks to select a 
running mate before the democratic national convention in midjuly 
and that he would be looking at a large number of people

michael dukakis presidential campaign notched a 
healthy fundraising month in may and more importantly remained 
far enough below the primary season spending cap to allow dukakis 
to campaign across the country before the democratic convention 
next month 
financial disclosure forms released by the dukakis campaign 
monday indicated that the campaign raised 2259359 in 
contributions in may and also received a 953121 in federal 
matching funds 
the campaign ended the month with 2 million on hand according 
to forms filed with the federal election commission 
the strong may fundraising effort brought to 857 million the 
amount the campaign has raised through contributions this calendar 
year according to the fec filing it received an additional 775 
million in matching funds during that period 
the fec forms indicated that as of may 31 dukakis had spent 
194 million against the 276 million spending cap for the 
primary season leaving him with a comfortable cushion that allows 
for the scheduling of several campaign trips before next months 
democratic national convention 
he spent three days in the south last week and has trips to the 
midwest and west planned before the atlanta convention 
careful budgeting has given us the finances so that right up 
until the convention the governor can go to different regions of 
the country and continue the campaign in an active and vibrant 
way said dukakis spokesman mark gearan careful budgeting has 
paid off 
dukakis republican counterpart vice president george bush has 
had to dramatically cut campaign travel because he has spent nearly 
to the limit 
robert a farmer campaign treasurer for dukakis said total 
fundraising including that of last year had reached 192 
million 
in a statement he said dukakis has received contributions from 
90000 individuals from all 50 states with an average donation of 
175 the maximum individual donation allowed by law is 1000 
farmer the man behind the dukakis campaigns recordsetting 
fundraising is planning to help national and state democratic 
party organizations raise money for the general election when the 
burden of campaign financing shifts from individual candidates to 
party groups 
this year the democrats are going to create a financially 
level playing field with the republicans farmer said 
at a fundraiser earlier this month that netted 500000 farmer 
said the dukakis camaign had reached its limit for primary 
fundraising and was concentrating on raising 26 million for a 
legal fund 
the latest financial disclosure form released by the dukakis

democrats michael dukakis and jesse jackson were holding their 
first facetoface talk today since dukakis wrapped up the partys 
presidential nomination two weeks ago republican george bush 
meanwhile said it burns me up when politicians fail to credit 
federal drug agents for a job well done 
meanwhile a poll published today in the washington post 
suggested dukakis holds a doubledigit lead over bush several 
other surveys in recent weeks have turned up similar results 
the vice president was highlighting drug issues today for the 
second day in a row meeting with narcoticsinterdiction officials 
and holding talks with drug advisers on monday he attended a 
memorial service for three drug enforcement administration agents 
killed in the line of duty 
in this political season i hear comments from people of both 
parties giving no credit to all the job the men and women in this 
room and across the country are doing bush told agency 
employees it burns me up 
the vice president the allbutcertain republican nominee has 
come under frequent fire from both dukakis and jackson over what 
they describe as a failed antidrug effort by the administration 
dukakis dished out more criticism on monday pointing out that a 
committee president reagan set up to coordinate antidrug programs 
was headed by attorney general edwin meese iii and adding 
sarcastically nuff said 
meese who has been under criminal investigation for more than a 
year was on hand for the ceremony bush attended and praised the 
vice president for his stance on drug issues 
the vice president took the opportunity to repeat his call for 
the death penalty for drug kingpins dukakis opposes the death 
penalty under any circumstances 
the massachusetts governor has been on the defensive on 
lawandorder isues in recent days bush has attacked him over a 
massachusetts prison program now revised which allowed murderers 
serving life sentences to go out on furloughs one murderer out on 
a massachusetts furlough raped a maryland woman prompting the 
change 
i know of no responsible corrections program in the country 
with very few exceptions that does not include furloughs 
dukakis said monday adding that there was a furlough program in 
california when reagan was governor 
as governor reagan terminated a work furlough program after two 
prisoners out on furlough killed a person during a 1972 robbery 
said bob gore a spokesman for the california department of 
corrections 
both dukakis and jackson were to be in california today and 
aides said they would meet this afternoon dukakis was speaking to 
a labor convention in los angeles jackson had no campaign 
appearances planned 
the pairs last gettogether was also in california on june 7 
the day of the states primary that along with contests in three 
other states gave dukakis a numerical lock on the nomination they 
have spoken frequently by phone since then 
neither campaign offered any specifics about what might be 
discussed today 
theyve been talking about convention issues said jackson 
spokesman pam smith that of course could include the prickly 
matter of who will be on the ticket with dukakis 
with less than a month remaining before the democrats convene in 
atlanta the massachusetts governor must soon select a running mate 
jackson has been insisting he deserves special consideration by 
virtue of his secondplace finish in the democratic contest but 
while he has indicated he wants to be offered the no 2 spot on the 
ticket he wont say whether hed accept it 
dukakis has said repeatedly that the choice is his alone to 
make several polls have suggested that the ticket would be hurt by 
jacksons presence 
the massachusetts governor said monday he is unworried about a 
possible confrontation with the jackson forces over his choice of a 
second or over platform issues 
i think we are going to be very much together he told 
broadcast executives in boston 
and he was at pains to dispel any notion that he feels pressured 
on the matter of a running mate pointing out he has the luxury 
of a few weeks to make the decision 
dukakis also has the luxury of being well below the federal 
spending cap for the preconvention phase of the campaign bush by 
contrast is bumping up against that limit and has been forced to 
curtail his campaign travel 
financial disclosure forms released monday by the dukakis 
campaign indicated that as of may 31 dukakis had spent 194 
million of the 27 million allowed 
careful budgeting has paid off said dukakis spokesman mark 
gearan the massachusetts governor has trips planned to the midwest 
and the west before the convention opens july 18 
the vice president however has found himself unable to travel 
at a time when polls are suggesting he needs to come on strong the 
washington post survey out today gave dukakis a 12point lead 51 
percent to 39 percent the telephone survey of 1012 adults of 
whom 782 were registered voters had a margin of error of 3 points 
for the larger sample and 4 points for the smaller group polling 
was conducted from wednesday to sunday 
jackson was in minnesota on monday where he visited a 
droughtstricken farm and gave every indication he would continue 
his increasingly quixotic presidential bid 
its dark and weve got to hold on until morning comes he 
said you never have a right to do less than your best

socialist president francois mitterrand of 
france who started the decade calling for a rupture with 
capitalism is still out of step with his summit colleagues as 
they march to a fanfare of praise for freemarket policies 
mitterrand and president reagan have both attended the past 
eight summits while reagan prepares for retirement the 
71yearold frenchman has just won reelection to a second 
sevenyear term 
but the fresh mandate does not seem to have given mitterrand 
greater weight with his peers or at least not enough to counteract 
his isolation as the only leftist among the seven heads of state 
and government wrapping up their threeday summit today 
mitterrand has abandoned the radical economic policies of 
198183 his first years in office but still is a long way from 
singing harmony with his conservative colleagues especially 
reagan and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
but at the same time he no longer needs to fear opposition 
within his own delegation from march 1986 until last month 
mitterrand was stuck in an uneasy powersharing arrangement called 
cohabitation with premier jacques chirac an enthusiastic 
follower of reagan and thatcherstyle economics 
chirac started selling off many of the banks and industries 
nationalized by the socialists but that was ended by mitterrands 
reelection last month and his appointment of socialist michel 
rocard as premier in a new government 
the french newspaper le monde published a frontpage cartoon 
showing an absentminded reagan greeting mitterrand at the summits 
opening and saying i dont see jacques chirac is he sick 
at the summit mitterrand has been the odd man out on 
noneconomic issues as well 
he objected to a us proposal to create a sevennation task 
force on drugs spokesman hubert vedrine said because he does not 
think the annual summits should take on duties and activities 
during the rest of the year 
rather than veto the proposal mitterrand abstained on a 
watereddown version that did not specify which nations might be 
members even though he still was opposed in principle the 
spokesman said 
france abstained to let this text pass vedrine said the 
fight against drugs is too important for us to block progress for 
whatever reason 
vedrine said mitterrand was pleased by the summits declaration 
monday on relations with the soviet union saying the seven leaders 
have come around to agree with the french presidents desire to 
improve relations with the east bloc 
american and british officials however said it was the tough 
western stands of previous years that helped bring about changes in 
the soviet union that make better relations possible 
aside from his political differences with his colleagues 
mitterrand also faces a language barrier he speaks only french so 
the only summit leaders with whom he can converse without an 
interpreter are canadian prime minister brian mulroney who is 
fluently bilingual and jacques delors the frenchman who heads the 
european economic community 
mitterrands austere style also clashes with reagans hearty 
cheer and with thatchers uncompromising directness so that after 
nearly a decade together at the summit there is little apparent 
warmth between them 
at this years summit mitterrands chief goal was an initiative 
to relieve the debts of the worlds poorest nations including many 
former french colonies in africa 
officials from other delegations said some debt proposal was 
sure to win approval but not in the form mitterrand proposed in a 
letter to his colleagues two weeks ago 
mitterrand is very associated with this issue and his views on 
it are respected said a canadian official speaking on condition 
of anonymity and leaving unspoken the implication that his views 
on economics get less attention

democratic presidential contender jesse 
jackson visited a farm near here and criticized reagan 
administration farm policies that he said have left farmers more 
vulnerable to the drought 
jackson examined the stunted corn crop at the farm of dale and 
nancy snesrud and called for a moratorium on farm foreclosures he 
said debtridden farmers hit hard by the drought could now fall 
victim to land speculators 
what we must do is declare a moratorium on foreclosures 
jackson said there is nothing we can do about an act of god but 
we must stop an act of the devil 
jackson blamed administration policies in part for driving 
650000 farmers out of business in the past eight years he said 
those farmers who have survived have no financial cushion to carry 
them through the drought 
if we can come up with creative ways to bail out chrysler and 
continental bank we can bail out family farmers and ranchers 
said jackson its a matter of who our country comes to the aid 
of 
to avoid droughtrelated livestock losses and curb the expected 
increase in meat prices later this year jackson said the 
government should free surplus grain for feed to make up for 
expected low crop yields 
snesrud who raises livestock corn and soybeans on 230 acres 
said his crops will be severely damaged unless theres a good 
rainfall in the next 10 to 14 days 
jackson said urban consumers will share the burden of the 
drought when the grocery prices increase during the fall and 
winter with the brunt of the blow taken by people on fixed 
incomes he said 
we have to take action before the impact takes place said 
jackson who led a brief prayer for rain what is happening in 
the field has an impact on the entire country 
the candidate also spoke monday in minneapolis to the 24th 
annual convocation of the opportunities industrialization centers 
of america a nonprofit organization of vocational schools that 
serves the needy 
its dark and weve got to hold on until morning comes 
jackson said you never have a right to do less than your best 
he urged the crowd to ask presidential candidates where do i 
fit in your budget 
jackson touted his own budget plan which would include more 
spending on social programs and freezing the military budget 
the democratic presidential hopeful was spending today in 
california but had no campaign appearances planned he scheduled a 
meeting with rival michael dukakis aides said

president jose napoleon duarte 
will return from next month from washington where he is being 
treated for terminal liver cancer and continue in office his son 
says 
alejandro duarte told a news conference monday that his 
62yearold father will return between july 5 and july 8 and 
immediately resume his duties 
his intellectual capacity is not affected by the treatment in 
fact it is admirable said the younger duarte 
my father is a fighter he said emphasizing that doctors 
say a cancer patients will and morale are a big factor in the 
prognosis 
the younger duarte said chemotherapy could extend his fathers 
life well into next year he said that according to statistics the 
president could reasonably expect to live between six and 18 months 
duartes fiveyear term ends june 1 1989 
he said his father will have to organize his work 
differently but that chemotherapy would not prevent him from 
carrying out his work 
duarte has spent the last three weeks in walter reed army 
medical center in washington he underwent surgery earlier this 
month to remove most of his stomach also affected by cancer 
duarte plans to return to walter reed in august but his later 
treatment would be in el salvador his son said 
at home the president faces a persistent 8yearold leftist 
guerrilla insurgency and divisions within his christian democratic 
party 
the party is sharply split over who will be its presidential 
candidate in march 1989 elections the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance handed the christian democrats a stunning 
defeat in municipal and legislative elections held in march and is 
considered likely to win the presidency 
vice president rodolfo castillo claramount is the acting 
president in duartes absence

this was supposed to be the year of 
optimism with debt down spirits up and many farmers expecting 
good crops and good prices in 1988 but now wayne wietbrock will 
settle for less breaking even 
along with thousands of farmers across the midwest wietbrock 
has seen the drought curl corn leaves and trap soybeans under dried 
chunks of cracked gray soil in his fields a brief rain monday he 
said did little to help 
wietbrock a thirdgeneration grain farmer in northwest indiana 
said if theres no break in the dry spell he could lose 30 percent 
of his corn 
but he added if i can break even ill count myself ok so 
many farmers just went completely bankrupt maybe we feel good just 
by staying where we are 
still the midwests worst drought in 50 years comes as many 
farmers having survived the mid1980s tough times are finally 
making a dent in their debt and starting back toward recovery 
its very frustrating for farmers just coming out of several 
years of low prices and a high debt situation said dennis 
vercler illinois farm bureau spokesman 
this is the year we looked at as starting to recover 
said rex barnes a farmer near new hampshire ohio if you dont 
have anything to sell it doesnt mean anything if prices are 
high 
many experts say its too early to tell what the impact will be 
because heavy rains in coming weeks could leave farmers in 
reasonably good shape but more dry weather could cause irreparable 
financial damage in the farm belt 
if we adopt a worst case scenario this could be a setback 
for the financial recovery side of agriculture said neil harl 
an iowa state university economics professor 
for farmers who were just barely making it this may be the 
marginal blow that puts the person in a place where they may not 
continue 
after the farm crisis of the mid1980s strong hog and cattle 
profits good yields and price support programs contributed to a 
record 449 billion net farm income in 1987 harl said while farm 
debt fell by 30 billion 
harl said 1987 was a record year for reducing farm debt which 
was about 158 billion at the end of last year compared with 216 
billion in 1983 
in iowa he added the latest figures show 21 percent of farmers 
with substantial financial problems compared with more than 30 
percent in 198586 
if the drought continues farmers will have less crop to deliver 
to the market and that means less income to spend on main street 
experts say the next few weeks are critical because the summer 
is usually very dry in the farm belt 
unless we have an unusually wet july and august were almost 
assured of having serious troubles harl said 
many farmers including tim abraham of lorain county ohio 
already have lowered their expectations 
financially we could salvage the year we could break 
even he said as far as making any large profits thats gone 
right now most people are willing or more than willing to accept a 
breakeven year 
another ohio farmer john bergman of st marys agrees 
if things keep up the way they are we will definitely suffer 
a lot he said itll set us back several years were not 
going to lose the place but were not going to forge ahead 
wietbrock 58 said if he goes this year without profits he 
wont be able to buy machinery and will make other sacrifices 
still he said he considers himself lucky because many others have 
been forced out of farming 
the family farm is a struggle for a lot of us to stay on he 
said i look around here and do not see any young farmer 
under 40 years old theres no young ones coming on something like 
this is going to further discourage others 
wietbrock also said he doesnt worry about the weather because 
it isnt going to make it rain any more 
a farmer is the eternal optimist he added he has to 
think next year will be better

many northwest farmers stand to benefit 
from the drought thats laying waste to crops in the midwest but 
they could easily become victims of the weather themselves 
agricultural experts say 
sparse rainfall and record heat have left the nations heartland 
parched and some states anticipate losing 40 percent of this 
years farm revenue but oregon and washington state farmers were 
blessed with late spring rains and cooler temperatures that boosted 
some crops but damaged others such as cherries 
washington state grange master ray hill is one who stands to 
both benefit and lose because of the drought 
hill a wheat grower and cattle rancher said he will make more 
money this year on wheat which is selling at nearly 1 a bushel 
more than last year due to the anticipated shortfall from the 
drought 
but he probably will lose money on his cattle because midwest 
farmers are sending to market steers they are unable to feed from 
parched fields beef prices which were peaking could become 
depressed as the midwest stock comes on the market he said 
as for wheat the picture is brighter than it has been in a 
long time he said 
it is definitely having a beneficial impact on our prices 
said thomas mick the washington wheat commissions administrator 
we hate to reap benefit off somebody elses misfortune but the 
futures prices of wheat are rising dramatically because of the 
drought and our wheat prices are based on those 
last year farmers received about 260 per bushel they are now 
looking at 335 to 350 a bushel mick said it is possible price 
rises will continue through the august harvest of washingtons and 
oregons predominantly soft white variety of wheat used for 
noodles and pasta 
midwest farmers grow a hard red variety thats used primarily in 
bread 
mick and hill said washington state growers still face potential 
crop losses because of weather if recent hot dry weather 
continues it could stress the crop but nothing like the midwest 
drought 
weve been lucky for the last three harvests said mick 
we barely made a crop then received extremely timely rains 
going into april we were in a drought situation ourselves the 
rains in april may and june saved the crops 
because of various government land setaside programs the total 
washington state wheat acreage is at its lowest in two decades but 
the total yield for the state is expected to be average or just 
below average mick said 
barley and corn growers also should benefit mick said because 
barley prices are closely related to corn prices and the midwest 
corn crop has been severely hurt by the drought 
although the prices paid for wheat are expected to rise 
consumers should barely feel the increase mick said 
mick said a 1 hike in the price of a bushel of wheat represents 
an increase of about 1 cents in the price of a loaf of bread he 
said

after more than seven years of dispute 
a lawsuit seeking to desegregate alabamas universities is back 
where it began and is headed for a new trial as a result of a us 
supreme court ruling 
the court without comment refused on monday to alter a ruling 
that a federal judge who found vestiges of segregation in the 
states schools should not have presided over the case 
officials from both sides of the lawsuit are working toward 
reaching a settlement said gov guy hunts legal adviser mark 
montiel 
montiel declined to discuss specifics that might help or impede 
a settlement 
its going to take a cooperative effort to resolve it he 
said its just a matter of sitting down and working toward that 
goal 
auburn university officials would not comment on pending 
litigation 
in 1983 the reagan administration sued the states higher 
education system alleging racial discrimination the lawsuit was 
filed after two years of efforts to settle the case among the 
college presidents and state school officials failed 
us district judge uw clemon the first black federal trial 
judge in alabama ruled after a 22day trial in 1985 that 
authorities would have to take steps to racially integrate such 
staterun schools as auburn the university of alabama and troy 
state clemon described auburn as the states most segregated 
university an opinion now void 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled last oct 6 
that clemon should have disqualified himself because as a former 
state legislator he actively participated in the very events and 
shaped the very facts that are at issue in this suit 
clemon once served as chairman of the state senate rules 
committee in that role the appeals court said he played a 
critical role in the confirmation of those individuals nominated 
for positions on the board of trustees of the defendant

the appeals court however rejected arguments that clemon 
should have disqualified himself because of his past civil rights 
activity and because his children may some day attend some of the 
schools involved 
to disqualify minority judges from major civil rights

intolerable the appellate court said

whatever the final communique says today host 
prime minister brian mulroney may remember the 14th economic summit 
with gratitude 
in a crucial special parliamentary election monday in quebec 
mulroneys handpicked candidate lucien bouchard won with ease 
ending a series of reversals for mulroneys progressive 
conservative party 
in addition summit partners signaled a general endorsement of 
the canadaus free trade agreement which has run into allout 
political opposition at home and will be the biggest issue in a 
general election mulroney must call by september 1989 
mulroney had put his personal credibility on the line in the 
election in lac saintjean quebec and he shared news of the 
victory with summit partners at dinner 
defeat for the conservatives would have been a humiliation for 
the prime minister who campaigned extensively in the district and 
showered it with 135 million in federal projects 
in march bouchard was brought back from paris where he was 
canadian ambassador to france and mulroney appointed his old 
friend to the cabinet as secretary of state cabinet ministers must 
be members of parliament and another conservative resigned to let 
bouchard run in lac saintjean 
known as the mr clean of quebec politics bouchard will be 
a key lieutenant for mulroney in the general election 
im very happy mr bouchard is an excellent quebecer and 
canadian who can render great service to canadas unity mulroney 
told reporters 
a mulroney aide later visited the prime minister and said 
hes not crowing or gloating but hes got his shirt off and his 
feet up and he says maybe now people will start seeing things the 
way he has 
most canadian governments run for four years of their fiveyear 
terms when the prime minister calls an election to seek a new 
mandate 
mulroney swept to power in september 1984 but has hesitated to 
call an election because opinion polls show the conservatives 
trailing the main opposition liberal party with just 30 percent 
voter support 
the liberals and the socialist opposition new democratic party 
have said they would tear up the free trade agreement mulroney 
negotiated with the reagan administration and which would dismantle 
trade barriers over the next decade 
mulroneys opponents accuse him of sacrificing canadian 
sovereignty in the deal 
the new democrats also oppose canadian membership in nato 
with the election win trade endorsement and successfully hosted 
summit one mulroney aide speaking on condition of anonymity 
commented you would think these things would have a great impact 
on the opinion polls

time flies but those earthbound spend about 
five years of their lives standing in lines and six months sitting 
at stoplights according to a time management expert who says every 
minute counts 
most people dont realize how much time theyre wasting 
said michael fortino president of the consulting firm priority 
management pittsburgh inc the whole point is to spend time doing 
the things that you want to do rather than the things you dislike 
to determine how time is spent priority management researchers 
often with stopwatch in hand studied hundreds of people around the 
nation for more than a year fortino said monday 
the study estimated the average person spends six months at 
stoplights eight months opening junk mail one year searching for 
misplaced objects two years trying to return telephone calls to 
people who never seem to be in four years doing housework five 
years in line and six years eating 
to determine which fastfood giants are the fastest university 
of pittsburgh business students commissioned by priority management 
timed clerks at wendys mcdonalds and burger king restaurants in 
pittsburgh at least 100 times each 
wendys won taking an average 46 seconds to serve a hamburger 
french fries and soft drink it took 1 minutes at mcdonalds and 
three minutes at burger king 
if we realize were wasting five years standing in line we 
can shift our time attend a more efficient grocery store or more 
effective bank fortino said 
many people spend relatively little time on things they say they 
value fortino said 
priority management conducted a telephone survey of more than 
1000 married people and marriage guidance counselors across the 
nation the study estimates the average married couple spends four 
minutes a day in meaningful conversation and the working couple 
spends 30 seconds a day talking with their children 
most people say their families are important but they dont 
live that way fortino said schedule a dinner with your family 
and commit to it as if it were a dinner appointment with a major 
corporate executive

crew members of the uss samuel b roberts 
hit the shore for a monthlong vacation after arriving home to 
balloons and flowers for the first time since the navy frigate hit 
a mine in the persian gulf in april 
the 140 sailors were greeted monday night by more than 350 
whooping wives girlfriends and other relatives as they arrived 
here at tf green state airport after the long flight from dubai 
in the gulf 
its great to be back im going to a cubs game one sailor 
shouted 
on april 14 while on escort duty in the gulf the 
guidedmissile vessel hit a mine that tore a 22 to 25foot hole in 
its bottom flooded its engine room and set a fire that took five 
hours to control 
the blast injured 10 crew members two critically all have 
since recovered navy officials said 
in retaliation for the mine which navy officials said was laid 
by iran the united states destroyed two iranian offshore platforms 
and sank or crippled six iranian ships 
vice admiral joseph s donnell iii commander of the atlantic 
fleets surface forces praised the crew monday calling them 
clearly national heroes 
the ship would have sunk had it not been for the crew theres 
no question about that donnell said 
the crew had to deploy small propellers driven by electric 
motors to get out of the mine field control a fire that was 
feeding on engine fuel shore up buckling bulkheads next to the 
flooded engine room and weld new plates and heavy wire to cracks 
to hold the ship together 
we did a job that were supposed to do said richard 
raymond 26 an operations specialist from spotswood nj 
but some said the ordeal was as harrowing as their family and 
friends had imagined 
the fires were really getting out of control and the 
flooding said scot joseph 20 a ships cook from new bedford 
mass we werent sure if we were going to stay afloat 
we felt right until they pumped the water out in the drydock 
two days after hitting the mine that we were at risk said lt 
cmdr john eckelberry the ships executive officer 
about 30 crew members were chosen to stay with the frigate when 
it returns sunday to the united states 
the ship is expected to arrive at its home port of newport about 
40 days later navy officials said in october it will be sent to 
the bath iron works in portland maine for repairs that could take 
a year donnell said 
the crew will be on leave until the roberts arrives in newport 
and then will be assigned to stay with the ship while it is being 
repaired said donnell

when a civilian president dares to 
tangle with a military chief in a country with haitis political 
history the winner is not difficult to predict 
this weeks military coup by lt gen henri namphy who led the 
nations threeman ruling junta for two years until january was 
the latest in a series of bitter disappointments for 
democraticminded haitians 
it ended the nations experiment with more than four months of 
nominal civilian rule and restored the armys almost uninterrupted 
political monopoly since independence in 1804 
namphy proclaimed a military government whose cabinet includes 
just one civilian and declared himself president on monday only a 
few hours after easily deposing president leslie manigat 
the armys latest occupation of the national palace shows 
haitis 6 million mostly illiterate and povertystricken people 
that little has apparently changed since they ran joyously through 
the streets in february 1986 celebrating the departure of 
jeanclaude duvalier and the end of the 29year dictatorship 
founded by his father francois papa doc duvalier 
twice in the past seven months haitians have had reason to hope 
democracy might finally be realized the days before thwarted 
elections in november and last week when manigat briefly asserted 
civilian control over the military 
both times haitians were abruptly and violently deprived of 
that hope 
manigat a 57yearold political scientist was elected jan 17 
in fraudriddled elections the ballotting was nevertheless the 
first that even hinted at democracy in almost 30 years 
though critics said manigat was put in power by the military he 
promised to reorganize the 7000man army and make it work toward 
developing the country 
even some of his critics cheered his attempt last week to assert 
civilian control over the military saying it confirmed his 
assertions he was not a military puppet 
he began wednesday by overruling a decision made by namphy the 
military commander on friday he fired namphy and put him under 
house arrest 
manigats audacity provoked a swift reaction on sunday when he 
sought to transfer many of namphys allies to lesser posts the 
army rebelled and returned namphy to power 
two years earlier namphy also raised the hopes of many haitians 
by promising to restore democracy and cede power to a 
freelyelected government 
he released political prisoners and pledged to try to recover 
millions of dollars from the duvaliers who left the countrys 
economy and agriculture in ruins 
but his 24 months at haitis helm were marred by constitutional 
violations and arbitrary arrests as well as assassinations of 
political leaders peasants and demonstrators 
meanwhile there was little change in the living conditions of 
the hungry and homeless masses 
in june 1987 namphys government tried to take control of 
national elections and in july his troops killed more than 100 
demonstrators who were demanding he step down 
on nov 29 months of enthusiasm and joy at the prospect of the 
countrys first genuinely free elections were shattered in an orgy 
of blood and death 
while namphys soldiers stood by or helped armed thugs shot and 
hacked to death more than 30 voters 
the massacre terrorized haitians and provoked outrage abroad 
when asked to go to the polls again jan 17 in armysupervised 
voting the most popular candidates refused to run and few haitians 
bothered to go to the polls

the nations health chief says the 
availability of maternal care in rural and innercity areas is 
being especially hurt by the soaring cost of medical malpractice 
insurance 
with family physicians often the only ones to serve an area 
numerous counties or entire regions of some states report that they 
have just one or two physicians to deliver babies health and 
human services secretary otis r bowen said on monday 
bowens remarks to an institute of medicine symposium were based 
largely on an hhs task force report on medical malpractice 
insurance issued last august 
bowen told the opening session of the symposium the american 
academy of family physicians reported last year that 186 percent 
of its members have dropped their obstetrical practice due to the 
cost of liability insurance or an inability to get malpractice 
insurance 
the independent institute of medicine is studying the effect of 
malpractice insurance issues on the delivery of maternal and child

the government has ordered the recall of scuba 
diving dry suits using air control valves made by diving unlimited 
international because malfunctioning valves may cause serious 
injury or death 
the consumer product safety commission said monday that owners 
of dry suits with ac air control valves made by the san 
diegobased diving unlimited international inc should 
immediately stop using the dry suits 
the commission said there have been 16 incidents associated with 
malfunctioning of the valve which deflates or inflates the dry 
suits to equalize air pressure while divers ascend or descend in 
water 
the commission said that unlike air control systems which use 
two separate valves duis onevalve system may cause air to fill 
the dry suit resulting in the diver rising rapidly to the surface 
or failing to provide sufficient air to maintain buoyancy 
dui says owners of suits with the companys valve should return 
their suits to the company and the valve will be replaced at no 
charge

percent in a similar survey on may 25 the massachusetts governor 
was ahead of the vice president by just a bit more 53 to 40 
percent

than dukakis ten percent of the voters said they know a great deal 
about dukakis compared to 29 percent for bush 
the survey suggested that only half the supporters of both 
candidates described themselves as strong supporters of the 
candidate of their choice with the remainder saying their 
preference is not strong 
the telephone survey of 1012 adults was conducted from 
wednesday to sunday of those 782 were registered voters

conditions in the midwest could cripple vice president george 
bushs chances of winning election as president 
theres no question that a drought fairly early on hurts the 
party in power rep steve gunderson rwis said monday 
fairly or unfairly we republicans have been accused over 
the last eight to 10 years of moving out the bad farm managers 
he said 
gunderson said the reagan administration must help farmers 
withstand the drought because i dont think you can justify 
putting farmers out of business because of circumstances beyond 
their control such as the weather 
he said the drought could make bush choose former rival kansas 
sen bob dole as his running mate because of doles support in the 
farm community

democratic officials are being asked to decide 
whether members of maines delegation should be seated at the 
national party convention even though the state party ignored a key 
rule in selecting delegates 
they may not meet the letter of the rule but they meet 
the spirit of the rule said estelle a lavoie a portland 
maine attorney told a national party hearing officer on monday 
hearing officer john nolan said he would make a report to the 
conventions rules committee before its meeting here on thursday 
if maine is judged in violation of the rules it could lose its 
four seats for democratic national committee members at the 
convention 
the state convention in may selected 23 delegates giving 11 to 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis nine to jesse jackson and 3 to 
an uncommitted group 
under national rules the uncommitted group would not have won 
any delegates since they had only 13 percent of the state 
convention delegates below the 15 percent national minimum but 
the maine rules specifically rejected any minimum threshold for 
winning national delegates

portauprince haiti ap lt gen henri namphy publicly 
running haiti again after four months of civilian government is a 
55yearold career soldier associates describe as forceful 
dedicated and patriotic 
namphy returned to power early monday in a coup that deposed the 
civilian president to whom he transferred power in february he had 
run the government since dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled the 
ocuntry feb 7 1986 
the general who had commanded duvaliers armed forces appeared 
on television a few hours after duvalier left in a us air force 
plane to announce formation of a provisional council that would 
govern and arrange a fair good and firm transition to 
democracy 
he was president of the council which eventually was reduced to 
a threeman junta and turned over power feb 7 to president leslie 
manigat who was elected the previous month with the armys help 
namphy is a solidly built man of medium height with steelgray 
eyes and closely cropped graying hair 
during his two years in the national palace namphy told 
associates he preferred life at home or in the barracks and spent 
weekends at his house with friends relaxing in his pool he and 
his wife gabrielle have an 11yearold daughter melissa 
born into a lowermiddle class family in northern haiti namphy 
attended a roman catholic elementary school in portauprince and 
the haitian military academy he speaks french creole and spanish 
at age 22 namphy was commissioned a lieutenant by francois 
papa doc duvalier jeanclaudes father 
in 1982 as a colonel he led the campaign against a small band 
of rebels who landed in northern haiti he was promoted to 
lieutenant general and soon after to chief of staff 
if i had to choose being president of this country is not 
what i would have chosen namphy said in an interview with the 
associated press in october 1986 i have only one thing to say to 
whoever is going to become president dont be late for the 
inauguration because im not going to wait around 
at my age i have never voted i dont know what voting is 
about i have to have my own civic education and if i need that 
you have to believe the people need that too 
he has shown little trust in democratic processes and appears to 
prefer ruling by decree 
when it was obvious that strongly antiduvalier candidates had 
the best chance of winning elections nov 29 1987 namphy tried to 
seize control from the independent electoral council soldiers 
killed at least 30 people when haitians held demonstrations that 
combined with diplomatic pressure forced namphy to back down 
he looked the other way as produvalier elements prohibited by 
the new constitution from running for office mounted a terror 
campaign against the election 
the electoral councils headquarters was burned and its members 
went into hiding on election day soldiers and thugs killed at 
least 34 voters and the election was called off three hours after 
it began 
namphy dissolved the electoral council and appointed a new 
electoral body to hold the jan 17 elections

an affluent suburb trying to spruce up its 
neighborhoods is having second thoughts about a law that bars 
pickup trucks from parking overnight in front of homes or in 
driveways the mayor says 
citing a need for equity for pickup owners nichols hills 
mayor mac maguire said monday he and other town leaders will use a 
90day moratorium to review the ordinance and how it affects 
residents 
the city adopted an ordinance several years ago to prohibit 
pickup trucks from parking in driveways or in front of homes 
between 8 pm and 6 am 
at a recent meeting the city council unanimously agreed to the 
moratorium because of complaints by residents who owned pickups and 
had received tickets for parking illegally outside their homes 
i dont think our citizens want the city to look unattractive 
in any way but they have a right to protect their property and 
they should have a place to park their vehicles maguire said 
i think the issue ought to be studied to see if there isnt some 
way we can achieve what the citizens want 
i dont believe we want to penalize citizens on this issue 
and i think we should listen to what they want 
the ordinances original intent was to prohibit commercial 
vehicles from parking in front of homes overnight maguire said 
but it has forced some residents to put their pickup in their 
garage and their cadillac in the driveway councilwoman ann 
taylor said

say kansas to someone in the big apple and 
out may pop the words wizard of oz or dorothy and toto 
probe a little deeper and you might get some comment about 
crosscountry car trips on highways that are straight as an arrow 
but gourmet food 
not many people in the east know us as anything more than 
covered wagons said bob storey a lawyer from topeka kan who 
stopped by bloomingdales salute to kansan cuisine with his wife 
kerry on a recent trip to manhattan 
it makes us feel great proud of kansas he said 
the new yorkbased department stores salute to land of oz 
delicacies began may 10 and ended saturday the promotion included 
some of the finest buffalo meat in the country popping corns that 
rival the best anywhere and elegant cream cakes that melt in the 
mouth 
there also were fresh catfish raised on a farm and 
gumdropsize cookies that have appeared on the tv series family 
ties 
bloomingdales which reordered some sunflower state specialties 
as often as four times reaped about 150000 in sales during the 
sixweek promotion at 15 of its stores it will continue to sell 
the items and expects to ring up an additional 100000 of kansan 
goods by dec 31 said bill lane merchandising manager for the 
gourmet food division 
why did bloomingdales which has already tipped its hat to 
vermont louisiana and oregon pick kansas for its fourth state 
promotion in as many years 
when you think of maple syrup you think of vermont when you 
think of kansas you really dont know said lane 
but the store found that kansas has plenty of downhome food and 
a mix of traditional farming values and pioneer spirit that appeals 
to its upscale urban customers 
the trend now is for nurturing comfort foods a play on the 
food you grew up with a play on food you understand without 
getting a dictionary out lane said 
randall tosh the states director of trade promotion and a 
walkingcomputer on kansas trivia called the promotion sort of

womens groups and city officials around the 
nation hailed a us supreme court ruling that cracks open the door 
of private allmale clubs to women and minorities by upholding a 
ban on exclusive membership policies 
hallelujah weve been waiting for this for a long time 
mayor edward i koch said monday lets open up the doors to 
women they dont bite 
we feel its one more nail in the coffin against 
discrimination of women in this country said kelly conlin 
president of the new york chapter of the national organization for 
women 
but members of some of the citys allmale clubs reacted angrily 
to the high court decision upholding a 1984 new york city law 
if men want to get together and have a club whats wrong with 
that said a man heading into the new york athletic club like 
all of the nearly two dozen members approached for comment monday 
he refused to give his name 
the ruling will strengthen the position of cities across the 
country including boston san francisco and los angeles that are 
trying to force large private clubs to comply with ordinances 
resembling new yorks local law 63 
buffalo sacramento calif chicago detroit and washington 
dc have or are considering similar laws 
the new york law bans discrimination in clubs that have more 
than 400 members provide regular meal service and rent their 
facilities to nonmembers for private functions the new york state 
clubs association comprising 125 private clubs and associations 
challenged it almost immediately 
beate bloch a lawyer who helped represent the us conference 
of mayors and other governmental organizations in backing the law 
called mondays ruling a victory that allows cities to enforce 
their laws against discrimination 
in boston the last bastions of singlesex socializing have a 
month to decide whether to fight or switch in light of the ruling 
said licensing board chairwoman andrea gargiulo 
the somerset club and tavern club for men and the chilton club 
for women must decide to comply with the citys policy or a 
hearing will be held to determine whether any club should be 
exempted she said 
los angeles plans to press ahead with a lawsuit accusing the 
3000member jonathan club of violating an antidiscrimination 
ordinance by reserving a bar and grill for male members city 
attorney james hahn said the club admitted its first female and 
black members last summer 
in san francisco city attorney louise renne said the ruling 
should strengthen the citys lawsuit against the allmale olympic 
club from which thenjudge anthony m kennedy resigned shortly 
before he was appointed to the supreme court last fall 
that lawsuit does not involve the citys antidiscrimination 
ordinance but instead relies on a state law barring discrimination 
by businesses 
new york has invoked the law against four maleonly clubs the 
10003member new york athletic club the 4329member university 
club the 1900member century association and the 1600member 
union league club 
the university club has since voted to admit women and the 
century association has said it would pending the high courts 
ruling 
the law merely prevents an association from using race sex or 
other specified characteristics as shorthand measures in place of 
what the city considers to be more legitimate criteria for 
determining membership justice byron r white wrote for the 
court 
though the court held that the law was constitutional it was 
careful to point out that specific clubs depending upon their 
facts and circumstances may mount casebycase challenges to the 
constitutionality of the law said attorney alan mansfield who 
represented the clubs association 
american bar association president rober mccrate whose 
organization had supported the city law praised the courts 
decision 
if women and minorities are to have equal access to the 
marketplace mccrate said socalled private clubs that are 
common place for business discussions and other activities related 
to the marketplace must be subject to antidiscrimination laws

the arrangement is based on an agreement in principle and no 
contracts have been signed the new york times reported today the 
productions are to be jointly presented by the met and bam

six soldiers killed in a 
blast during a training course were working with explosives capable 
of blowing up a small house an official said 
three other soldiers were injured in mondays blast near the 
canadian forces base in chilliwack 
killed were secondyear officer training cadets in the third day 
of a fourday training session on explosives handling said lt 
col graham meharg 
further explosives training at the base was suspended pending an 
investigation officials said 
there were no immediate clues as to what went wrong meharg 
said some survivors were in shock and meharg would not allow any 
of the soldiers to speak with reporters 
meharg said he believed the dead included men and women but 
refused to provide further details 
two of the injured men were listed as stable at chilliwack 
general hospital and the third also a man suffered multiple 
fractures and was transfered to a vancouver hospital said 
chilliwack hospital spokeswoman etta richmond 
the unit 29 students seven instructors and five support staff 
was engaged in an exercise known as cratering when the 
explosives went off prematurely on monday afternoon meharg said 
cratering requires approximately 60 pounds of plastic explosives 
and involves blowing a hole in the ground about 10 or 12 feet wide 
and deep mehrag said the amount of explosives was enough to blow 
up a small house he said 
the accident site 20 miles southeast of the base was 
immediately cordoned off 
among its many functions the large base at chilliwack a city 
of more than 40000 people about 60 miles east of vancouver serves 
as a training ground for an armed forces officer candidate school 
and the school of military engineering it is also home to no 1 
combat engineers regiment 
the explosion is the latest in a series of armed forces 
accidents involving explosives 
earlier this month six soldiers were injured by exploding 
mortar shells during a live ammunition training session at canadian 
forces base gagetown in new brunswick 
the soldiers members of the second battalion of the royal 
canadian regiment were practicing advancing on an enemy position 
that was protected by mortar fire 
the shells were supposed to land well in front of the advancing 
troops but landed in the middle of a group of soldiers peppering 
them with shrapnel 
in january eight soldiers at canadian forces base valcartier 
quebec were injured when an old artillery shell that was buried 
underneath a campfire exploded

the nations influential roman catholic 
bishops say communist authorities will plunge poland deeper into 
poverty unless they allow the political freedoms necessary to make 
promised economic reforms work 
in their first statement since last months labor unrest the 
bishops called for greater freedom of association and reinstatement 
of the free trade unions the government denied citizens 6 years 
ago 
the statement monday came as the banned solidarity independent 
labor federation accused the government of dramatically inflating 
the reported 56 percent turnout in nationwide regional and local 
elections held sunday 
since a nearly threeweek strike wave that ended may 10 the 
government has said it wants to accelerate its economic reform 
program and may legalize certain independent associations 
the bishops communique issued after a weekend conference in 
the northeastern city of bialystok criticized the pace of the 
governments program of political and economic reforms 
numerous announcements are not accompanied by equally 
energetic actions it says 
the recent strikes stemmed mainly from economic causes the 
impoverishing of society and the remarkable increase in the 
cost of living for families the communique says 
prices have risen by at least 40 percent so far this year 
opposition spokesmen say the government should recognize 
solidarity and begin negotiations with the opposition on solving 
polands economic problems 
the bishops share basic concern over the state of the country 
and societys basic rights they said in their statement 
the church says more than 90 percent of polands 37 million 
people are roman catholics 
critical judgment of the situation should lead to 
courageous and farsighted changes which are commonly believed 
necessary in the economic social and political spheres the 
bishops said 
referring to the authorities announced plans to make it easier 
to form private associations the bishops said this may 
contribute to the rise of creative activity in the society 
but they said the changes must create freedom of associating 
accessible for all regardless of political viewpoint and 
eliminate administrative and political interference in associations 
even farreaching changes in this field will not replace the 
need of trade union pluralism which according to the social 
teaching of the church belongs to the basic rights of working 
people the statement adds 
trade union pluralism is one of the basic demands of solidarity 
which has remained active though it was banned after a december 
1981 military crackdown 
about 50 solidarity local organizations have sought registration 
in the courts over the past year but all have been denied it on 
the grounds officially recognized unions already exist at the 
plants 
government spokesman jerzy urban said poor economic conditions 
discouraged some people from attending sundays voting but argued 
that the elections were a breakthrough because some candidates 
actively campaigned for the first time and some races were 
contested between people of different parties

cleanup crews hauled away 300pound 
barrels of chlorine compounds and officials met to assess the 
damage of a fourday fire that destroyed a chemical factory and 
forced the evacuations of 25000 people 
residents who fled their homes as poisonous yellowgreen fumes 
wafted over the states thirdlargest city were allowed to return 
monday after firefighters neutralized leftover chemicals in the 
advanced laboratories plant 
about 275 people including 22 firefighters were treated for 
respiratory problems and chlorine burns as explosions peppered the 
centuryold mill housing the factory 
mayor richard neal planned to meet today with lt gov evelyn 
murphy and state department of environmental quality engineering 
commissioner daniel greenbaum to determine what state aid is 
available for this city of 150000 residents 
theres a hefty price to this fourday problem neal said 
no damage estimate was available but authorities have placed 
the cost in the millions of dollars 
firefighters pumped 6000 gallons of water per minute for 36 
hours to flood the factory and quell hundreds of small explosions 
that rattled the plant which made chloride pellets used to 
disinfect swimming pools during a series of fires that began 
friday 
the fire belched a chlorine cloud measuring 100 feet high three 
miles long and four city blocks wide at its peak flames soared 100 
feet above the plant the fumes scorched vegetation and were 
smelled 15 miles away 
after the explosions ceased monday morning crews poured in a 
mixture of boric acid and sodium sulfate to turn the remaining 
chlorine compounds into harmless salt 
only the street in front of the plant remained closed and police 
patrols and fire trucks remained on the scene fire commissioner 
darnell l williams said 
the end of the plant where there were no chemicals is just 
black with a foot of water and muck on the floor said john 
higgins regional director of the environment quality department 
the predominant color on the other end where the chemicals 
were is a rusty orange from the oxidation of the barrel rings and 
other metal that rusted in the chlorine atmosphere he said 
its a huge mess 
authorities said the first fire started when rain blew through 
an open window and triggered a chemical reaction and fire in a 
hopper of chlorine compounds 
richard lincourt said he had been at one of several area 
shelters since police woke him early saturday morning 
im going to be the first one out this door lincourt said 
before boarding a school bus to return home 
the door isnt wide enough because were all going to be 
going another evacuee said

many of al hirschfelds caricatures have come to 
life to celebrate the artists 85th birthday today 
celebrities from the art and theater worlds turned out monday 
night at the margo feiden galleries in greenwich village where 
much of hirschfelds work is displayed to honor the man who has 
captured many of their likenesses 
the artist known for his caricatures of celebrities as diverse 
as humphrey bogart superman and albert einstein estimates 
conservatively that he has sketched more than 3000 drawings 
hirschfeld draws the caricatures in the studio of his east side 
town house while sitting in an old barber chair in front of a 
heavily scarred wooden drawing table 
in an interview with the new york times where many of the 
artists caricatures are published hirschfeld said his career 
began in the 1920s when a friend who happened to be a press agent 
took a look at a caricature he had sketched on a program during a 
theater performance 
that sketch was sold to the herald tribune which wanted another 
one the following week about a year later the times started 
requesting sketches and hirschfeld kept them coming over the years 
hirschfeld said drawing feeds his insatiable appetite for pure 
line for distillation for bringing things down to the simplest 
form 
what i do across all the years of staring at a blank piece of 
paper is create a new problem every time and then solve it to my 
own satisfaction he said 
hirschfelds drawings all contain a game for the viewer the 
name of his daughter nina appears in all the sketches and the 
number of times the name appears is revealed next to the artists 
name 
nina was born on oct 20 1945 and on that day i put in a 
drawing in a circus poster in the background a little baby 
reading a book called nina the wonder child he said and 
since then it has become a national insanity 
the times article today played on the game with a small 6 
next to the byline indicating there were six ninas in the text 
including one hidden in the first four paragraphs

a professor says he has determined that an 
unsigned untitled story was by charles dickens and shows the 
authors penchant for interchanging personal details of his own 
life with those of his characters 
professor harry stone of california state university at 
northridge made the find in household words the weekly journal 
edited by dickens for nine years 
stone has named the 1857 work the brides chamber the new 
york times reported today 
the story is a selfcontained segment of a tale in five 
installments called the lazy tour of two idle apprentices the 
times said scholars knew the overall tale was a collaboration 
between dickens and wilkie collins but until now no one could say 
which of the two wrote which segment the times said 
the story reveals how dickens fell in love with an 18yearold 
actress ellen lawless ternan who remained the married authors 
mistress until his death stone said the character of the young 
woman in the story also is named ellen 
two other dickens scholars professors steven marcus of 
columbia university and richard dunne chairman of the english 
department at the university of washington in seattle said 
stones find could add to a more complete understanding of the 
british master 
i know stone and his writings and he is a very careful 
researcher dunne said 
besides the connection created by the use of the name ellen 
which stone considered a key clue the professor said he also 
concluded that dickens was the author by using letters from dickens 
along with other contemporary evidence one piece of evidence was a 
detailed ledger maintained by an editor of dickens journal telling 
who wrote what in the publication stone said 
when dickens wrote the story stone said the author was on the 
verge of a great emotional crisis and considered the young actress 
who entered his life at that time as a heroine 
all the novels dickens wrote after the story including a tale 
of two cities and great expectations contain a central 
character made miserable and often destroyed by a consuming 
passion stone said 
the brides chamber goes to the heart of dickens himself 
he said

texas cattlemen and florida citrus growers were 
enthusiastic about japans decision to liberalize import 
restrictions and double the amount of beef and oranges it buys from 
the united states 
its going to be a morale booster for us and its going to 
help our markets some charles e ball executive vice president 
of the texas cattle feeders association in amarillo said monday 
this has been a psychological thing for our people the fact 
that we import so much from japan while theyve had barriers on our 
beef and citrus over there ball said 
the agreement announced monday in tokyo by us trade 
representative clayton yeutter calls on japan to nearly double its 
beef imports by 1991 it also provides for doubling of japans 
imports of oranges from the united states 
its clearly beneficial a positive step forward for the 
florida industry said robert behr director of economic research 
for the florida department of citrus in orlando fla 
japan is floridas largest export market for fresh grapefruit 
and florida growers hope the agreement will boost sales of other 
citrus products 
we have the potential for similar growth in orange and orange 
juice that we have had with grapefruit said lee bouldin 
international marketing director for the citrus department 
the us agriculture department said total american citrus sales 
to japan could increase from 50 million to 150 a million a year 
when the quotas are lifted the agreement could double us exports 
of beef and oranges to more than 1 billion annually yeutter said 
under the agreement japan will be allowed to set beef tariffs 
of 70 percent in 1991 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to 
allow japanese farmers time to adjust 
japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22000 
tons annually to 192000 tons in 1990 
some texas cattlemen said they doubt that theyll see an 
immediate financial gain as a result of the agreement 
the import quota as i understand it was very small anyway and 
doubling something that was small to begin with is going to have a 
pretty minor impact but its a step in the right direction said 
san angelo rancher skipper duncan who raises feeder cattle 
in japan some farmers have reacted angrily to the agreement 
and one cattle farmer committed suicide to protest the 
liberalization of the countrys agricultural markets 
ikko abe 57 a farmer in iwate prefecture of northern japan 
died after hanging himself on saturday but details of his death 
were not released until today said a police official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said abe left a note saying i oppose the liberalization of 
beef imports i will protest it with my death 
abe owned 50 head of cattle and 247 acres of rice paddies the 
official said iwate prefecture is the fourth largest producer of 
beef in japan

france has detonated another 
nuclear weapon in the south pacific as part of its series of 
underground tests in the region the foreign minister said today 
the minister russell marshall condemned frances continued 
testing of nuclear weapons in the region 
marshall also minister for disarmament and arms control was 
responding to a report from new zealand government scientists that 
france had conducted a small underground nuclear test at mururoa 
atoll on friday 
they said it was the third blast there this year and the 98th in 
the series started in 1976 when france abandoned atmospheric 
testing 
new zealand monitored the blast at raratonga in the cook 
islands about 1800 miles northeast of its coast 
the weapon carried an explosive yield of five kilotons the 
equivalent of 5000 tons of dynamite said government seismologist 
murray lowry 
this explosion is smaller than most but even so weapons of 
this size would cause enormous destruction it is totally 
reprehensible marshall said 
he added the fact that we detected this explosion is further 
evidence that the means of verifying a ban on testing are at hand 
new zealand has called for a comprehensive ban on such nuclear 
tests 
the nation joins its south pacific neighbor australia in 
vigorously opposing french nuclear testing in the region 
france refuses to comment on reports of its testing

chocolate cheesecake or peaches

and heard someone ask may i take your order please he said 
lingering over hot food and fresh coffee is an unaccustomed 
pleasure 
its been awhile i aint had no money shears said he

burgundy corn and green beans with ham hocks 
the atmosphere here is a whole lot different from a soup 
kitchen said shears who lives in a shelter it kind of makes 
you feel like a person again 
jim zerdecki who usually stays in shelters agreed

the drought is driving up corn and 
soybean prices but some farmers are reluctant to sell their stored 
grain despite the huge profits they could make 
soybean prices hit an 11year high of 10 a bushel monday on the 
chicago board of trade 
every day without rain could translate into more profit for 
farmers choosing to sit tight 
yet they are in a quandary should they sell now and hope for a 
bountiful harvest that will replenish storage or should they hang 
on to what they have and risk losing money once it rains and prices 
plummet 
i think theres quite a few farmers just waiting for prices to 
go higher my fatherinlaw told me over the weekend that he sold 
his beans a month ago and look what he could have gotten now 
said susan anderson a spokeswoman for the iowa farm bureau 
she also said she knows of a man who has enough soybeans to 
cover this years crop loss 
he said it didnt matter if he got a crop this year with the 
way prices are going ms anderson said 
i dont know when is a good time to unload storage everybody 
is scared to death said kurt lehman who with his father dean 
farms near alleman 
if beans get up to 11 12 13 a bushel at that point 
you start selling and take your chances whether you get a crop or 
not he said 
if it starts raining prices will drop and theres the 
potential to lose profits its a nerveracking game youre 
gambling on the weather lehman said right now i could get a 
darn good profit if i wanted to sell 
farmers are guaranteed a federal loan price for their corn and 
soybeans in previous years when market prices were significantly 
lower many chose to take the federal payment and forfeit their 
crop said jerry perkins spokesman for the iowa corn growers 
association 
if the government loan rate was higher than the cash price 
the government would hold the grain as collateral the farmer takes 
the government money goes out and spends it and says ok 
government keep the grain perkins said 
this year though cash prices are going high enough so if 
the cash price is above the loan rate the farmer says ok 
government sell my corn take my loan rate and interest out and 
give me whats left over he said 
dick naeze who farms 750 acres of corn and soybeans in 
humboldt figures he would clear about 5 a bushel for his 4000 
bushels of soybeans he has stored on his farm 
that would be very good he said but im hanging on to it 
because its going up 30 cents a day gee why sell it

a communist party newspaper has heaped more 
criticism on the late dictator josef stalin faulting him for 
signing a friendship pact with nazi germany and hobbling the army 
with purges just before world war ii 
many articles in recent months have attacked stalin for purging 
those he called enemies of the people and for the violent way 
he collectivized agriculture and forced the country to 
industrialize 
but his reputation as the leader who galvanized the soviet 
nation to resist the nazi invaders and drive them out had been left 
largely intact 
on monday however pravda published a chapter of a new 
biography by gen dmitri volkogonov that reassesses stalins 
military wisdom 
the fullpage article appeared two days before the 47th 
anniversary of the german invasion which usually elicits solemn 
articles about soviet heroism in the center of the page was a 
photograph of stalin smiling and shaking hands with joachim von 
ribbentrop hitlers foreign minister with a caption that said 
we call your attention to this 
in our opinion it was a major political lapse to sign the 
treaty on friendship and the border between the ussr and 
germany on sept 28 1939 the article says the line should 
have been drawn at the signing of the nonaggression pact the month 
before which evidently was a forced step 
while the nonaggression pact shocked the nonfascist 
governments of europe the subsequent treaty shook the foundations 
of communist ideology by declaring friendship between the soviet 
union and the fascist adolf hitler 
volkogonov questioned how stalin and his premier vyacheslav m 
molotov could forge a friendship with the nazis to practically 
disavow all our own antifascist ideological positions that was 
too much the article said 
soviet historians have in the past portrayed the nonaggression 
pact as necessary because the nation was too weak to confront 
germany and needed time to prepare it is said to have bought time 
for the soviets to build the arms industry and seize territory 
particularly eastern poland as a buffer 
history books have obscured the friendship treaty tending to 
lump it in with the nonagression pact 
the article takes stalin who ruled the soviet union from 1927 
until his death in 1953 to task for military blunders calling him 
a cocksure politician rather than military strategist and it 
describes the purges which western historians say deprived the red 
army of its best officers 
senseless and bloody terror reached the limits which 
threatened the existence of the very system on the eve of the 
hardest trials volkogonov said two years before the war which 
was coming to the borders of the motherland the country was made 
feeble 
he described stalin as a man blinded by his own 
stubbornness unable to admit mistakes and declared 
if we innocently refer to foreign policy and strategic 
blunders as stalins miscalculations then in the realm of 
personnel his actions were plainly criminal the enormous scale of 
the repressions were possible only because the leader created a 
social inertia of violence which begot denunciations lack of 
principles slander and mass lies 
media criticism of stalin has increased in recent months 
particularly since a speech soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
delivered nov 2 1987 to mark the 70th anniversary of the 
bolshevik revolution 
gorbachev criticized stalin for repression and for executing 
political rivals on false charges of treason but said forced 
programs of industrializing the country and collectivizing 
agriculture were justified because the country needed to be 
modernized 
he did not mention figures but western historians say millions 
of people died in the 1930s purges

an investigation of allegations of sexual 
abuse at a daycare center at the armys presidio base has been 
closed due to a lack of evidence officials announced 
there is no reasonable likelihood that further investigative 
effort would have developed evidence to support a criminal 
prosecution us attorney joseph russoniello said monday 
he said the 19month federal probe of allegations that 60 or 
more children were sexually abused at the presidio child 
development center had ended despite his belief that children had 
been molested there 
some children may have made up stories when talking with 
investigators he said and others were too young to remember and 
relate what happened still others russoniello said could not 
have testified because of their immaturity 
families have filed 53 million worth of claims on behalf of 
themselves and their children in connection with the abuse 
investigation presidio spokesman bob mahoney said 
jerome garchik an attorney for two of the families predicted a 
rash of lawsuits against the army he said the federal government 
should set up a fund of up to 50 million to compensate the alleged 
victims and their families 
in february a federal judge dismissed the final abuse charge 
against a former worker at the center after the parents of a child 
who allegedly was molested refused to participate in a trial 
the employee once faced 11 molestation charges involving 10 
children but all but the final charge were dismissed due to lack 
of evidence or vagueness 
his indictment last october resulted in the examination of 
nearly 100 children from the center for signs of physical or 
psychological abuse 
allegations about the center surfaced in 1986 when a 3yearold 
boy who attended it told his parents he had been molested

conference said fire chief walter shanahan 
but firefighters extinguished the blaze within an hour of the 
initial alarm and no leaders were reported evacuated 
cinders showered the street in the citys financial district as 
the blaze initially threatened to spread to nearby buildings but a 
wave of firefighters arrived and doused the flames preventing 
further damage 
the fire marshals office was called in to investigate because 
of suspicions the blaze was deliberately set said shanahan 
sgt rick morris a spokesman for the summit security force 
said it doesnt look like its related to the summit at all 
security around reagans hotel was tight but morris said there 
were no plans to evacuate the president from the royal york hotel 
about 150 yards southwest of the fire british prime minister 
margaret thatcher remained inside the king edward hotel about 150 
yards northeast of the blaze

the dollar was holding steady in calm european 
trading late this morning despite a small increase in shortterm 
west german interest rates earlier in the session 
gold prices fell 
dealers said the deutsche bundesbanks decision to raise the 
rate on securities repurchase agreements to 35 percent from 325 
percent had been expected and didnt have any immediate impact on 
the currency market 
higher west german interest rates make west german investments 
more attractive which could depress demand for the dollar 
the market is relatively tranquil said one senior trader 
with a foreign bank in milan activity has essentially halted to 
see whether theres going to be any reaction to the movements in 
interest rates 
he added that the rate hike already had been discounted by the 
market 
the market also was in a waitandsee mood over the toronto

the announcement came hours after gaborone police announced that 
a car bomb had exploded early today near the home of a building 
contractor in the capital 
the presidential statement said the bombing was yet another 
south african attempt on the lives of innocent botswana 
police said the bomb exploded at 6 am under a light truck 
parked outside the house of allison seketso in a residential area 
the bomb destroyed the truck and damaged seketsos house 
seketso and his family were at home but were not injured police 
said 
it could not immediately be determined if seketso was in any way 
affiliated with the anc 
there was no immediate comment from south africa which in the 
past has staged crossborder raids on botswana and other 
neighboring countries to attack suspected facilities of the african 
national congress which seeks to overthrow south africas 
whiteled government 
south african commandos have repeatedly conducted raids in 
gaborone against people they say are black nationalist guerrillas 
using the botswana capital as a staging post for sabotage attacks 
in south africa 
south african soldiers killed three women and one man in march 
when they raided a house and waged an hourlong gun battle on the 
edge of the city 
south africans killed one person in a may 1986 attack against 
alleged hideouts of anc guerrillas fifteen were killed in a june 
1985 south african raid 
botswana officials have often denied the presence of anc 
guerrillas although the government is sympathetic to the ancs 
aims 
the anc seeks to end the apartheid system of racesegregation 
to install a oneman onevote political system and to establish 
government controls over major economic sectors

but neighbors say they will live in fear until he is found and sent 
packing 
i find it hard to believe that none of the police departments

heitlinger among 50 residents of the neighborhood who met at a 
recreation center monday night 
two weeks ago singleton listed his brothers home in the 
residential forest hills neighborhood as his address to comply with 
a state law on incoming felons but he hasnt shown up there and 
his brother refuses to say where he really lives

san quentin prison and is now a free man 
hillsborough county sheriffs col cal henderson told residents

we get 30 exconvicts coming into the county every month and

hundreds of radical students 
marched at the border today to demand reunification of north and 
south korea and the withdrawal of american troops 
about 350 students from seouls konkuk university held their 
peaceful protest in front of steel barriers and barbed wire that 
block a bridge leading to the border with communist north korea 
drive out yankees who hinder unification students shouted 
as they marched near the bridge after a ceremony at which they 
prayed for reunification of the peninsula 
in seoul a survey indicated that antius sentiment was 
growing among south koreans and went beyond radical student 
protesters 
according to the survey 16 percent of 2000 eligible voters 
questioned said they dislike the united states compared to 3 
percent in 1984 
as the students protested today an american soldier guarded the 
bridge and about 20 south korean policemen and soldiers in 
plainclothes patrolled nearby 
the bridge is the only civilian access linking the koreas us 
forces help control the southern side of the demilitarized zone 
across from imjingak and roads to the truce site of panmunjom 
which straddles the border 
the students demanded withdrawal of about 42000 us troops 
stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact to help deter 
north korean attacks the protesters contend the united states 
enforces partition of the peninsula 
they also denounced the blocking june 10 of a planned march to 
the north korean border fierce street clashes broke out that day 
when riot police fired tear gas to block thousands of students 
trying to march to panmunjom for talks with north korean students 
during todays border rally student leaders called for dialogue 
with north korean students to help form a unified korean team for 
the summer olympics opening sept 17 in seoul 
in the poll at least 37 percent of those surveyed said they 
like the united states down from 70 percent four years ago 
to heungyul a researcher at hyundai research institute in 
seoul released the survey in a seminar 
the survey said antius feelings were rapidly spreading 
partly in response to a steady antius campaign by radical 
students 
he also attributed the growing antius trend to washingtons 
policies including pressure to open the south korean market wider 
especially to american products 
of 3700 college students surveyed the researcher reported that 
85 percent held the united states responsible for partition of the 
korean peninsula 
the united states and the soviet union divided the peninsula in 
1945 to end japanese occupation at the end of world war ii the 
communist nation was established in the north in 1948 and a 
prowestern republic was created in the south 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 starting the korean war

officials of a rocket fuel plant that 
exploded last month say they have reached agreement with rocket 
producer morton thiokol inc and nasa to provide the required 
financial support for building a new plant 
pacific engineering and production co said monday it would seek 
33 million in bank financing to rebuild the plant on a site 
farther from residents 
two people were killed and 326 injured in the may 4 explosion 
that caused 73 million damage as it leveled the pacific 
engineering plant and damaged dozens of other buildings for miles 
around 
pacific engineering president fred gibson jr reiterated in a 
statement monday that the company believed the blast was caused by 
a natural gas line at the plant 
southwest gas corp and clark county fire officials however 
have discounted natural gas as the cause 
fire officials have not issued their report on the blast but 
department sources have said the most likely cause was a spark that 
set off the fuel union officials have alleged safety violations 
under the rebuilding plan the bank loan would be repaid over 
seven years with installments based on sales profit and cash flow 
according to the company statement 
the remainder after seven years will be paid by the government 
the statement said but it did not specify the amount 
the plan was agreed to by the national aeronautics and space 
administration and morton thiokol which manufactures the solid 
rocket fuel boosters that use the fuel component made by the plant 
the statement said 
we have reviewed a large number of potential plant sites 
two of which are approximately 60 miles northeast of las vegas 
gibson said but added that none had been selected 
the plant is said to be vital to the nations space program it 
and another henderson plant owned by kerrmcgee corp are the 
only two plants in the nation making ammonium perchlorate which 
provides the oxygen necessary to burn solid fuel in the booster 
rockets 
national aeronautics and space administration officials said 
after the blast that they had enough ammonium perchlorate left for 
eight shuttle boosters or four flights 
the kerrmcgee plant stopped producing the chemical after the 
blast but resumed the production last week 
government agencies agreed earlier this month to allow pacific 
engineering and kerrmcgee to levy a surcharge to cover rebuilding 
and expansion costs

defense minister yitzhak rabin said 
today that all israelis not just the army should defend 
settlements in the occupied territories 
rabin in an interview with the assoiciated press also said he 
was right to encourage civilians to open fire on arabs armed with 
gasoline bombs 
the defense minister said he would explain his views to 
president reagan and american officials during his visit to 
washington next week the date of his departure has not been 
disclosed for security reasons 
we have to try together the military and the civilians to 
take all the measures needed to put down the violence rabin 
said 
the united states has repeatedly expressed concern over israeli 
tactics to quell 6 months of arab unrest in the occupied 
territories 
american officials have recently criticized rabins statements 
encouraging civilians to carry weapons and use them for 
selfdefense and against arabs armed with firebombs 
every civilian settlement is organized for selfdefense 
rabin said we have lived with terror since the new zionist 
movement started 100 years ago we are in a prolonged war of 
independence and everyone has to be aware prepared equipped 
he further indicated that an israeli farmer who was bludgeoned 
and stabbed to death sunday night should have been carrying a 
weapon 
the body of 33yearold eli cohen was found monday 
i am really sorry the farmer who was attacked and viciously 
killed did not have the weapon that we would have hoped he would 
rabin said i believe the whole results would be entirely 
different he would be alive today 
rabin said the level of violence in the occupied territories had 
been reduced but was still unacceptable 
we are determined to meet violence by force he said 
nevertheless rabin said his recent meetings with palestinians 
in the territories were important to help restore calm 
rabin disclosed he had held four closeddoor meetings with 
palestinians from the occupied territories over the last several 
weeks and said 13 to 15 arabs had attended those sessions he 
declined to reveal names saying some of those who had met with him 
had received death threats 
he said he did not negotiate with the palestinians we just 
exchanged views sometimes conflicting views he said 
he said the palestinians he met represent a wide variety of 
opinions but he added none of them is formally a member of any 
of the plo organizations with them i would not have met 
israel regards the palestine liberation organization as a 
terrorist group and has outlawed meetings between israelis and plo 
members

iranian rebels claimed today they killed or 
wounded 8000 of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis soldiers in three 
days of fighting the rebels captured the border town of mehran in 
the battle 
a spokesman for the iraqibased national liberation army told 
the associated press in cyprus that rebel forces were still engaged 
in combat today around mehran he gave no details 
rebels admitted that at least 57 of their troops were killed and 
120 were badly wounded in the fighting 
the mehran offensive was the rebels biggest operation the nla 
is the main iranian dissident movement that seeks to topple 
khomeinis government 
the iranian casualties claimed by the rebels could not be 
independently confirmed reporters saw more than 1500 iranian 
prisoners brought to badrah on monday 
mehran is about six miles east of badrah and 90 miles from the 
iraqi capital baghdad 
the rebels said in a statement issued by their headquarters in 
baghdad that their forces routed 32 battalions of iranian regulars 
and revolutionary guards in their offensive 
as the 22 brigades of rebels were apparently gradually 
disengaging to pull back across the border into iraq rebel 
commanders have said they did not plan to hold mehran whose 
civilian population fled years ago 
a rebel communique had estimated the iranian strength around 
mehran at 16000 government troops and revolutionary guards up 
from previous estimates of 14000 
the rebels did not say how many fighters it had committed to the 
battle for mehran but its assault force involved an estimated 
several thousand men and women 
mehran which has changed hands several times in the nearly 
8yearold iraniraq war lies a few hundred yards inside iran 
the biggest operation before this was operation shining sun in 
march in which the rebels said 15 of its brigades routed the 
iranians elite 77th khorasan division in southwest iran killing 
or wounding 2000 men and capturing 1500 
the rebels said their gunners shot down an iranian air force 
cobra helicopter gunship monday 
mehran itself was lightly held and resistance was minimal but 
fighting around positions in the foothills of the kani sakht 
mountains to the north was reported fierce 
the rebels began moving massive huge amounts of captured 
military equipment back across the border to badrah monday

government troops captured a 
communist rebel leader and 40 other guerrillas and dismantled a 
major base used by insurgents to launch raids on the main island of 
luzon military officials said today 
gen renato de villa the army chief of staff presented the 
captured guerrilla leader at a news conference and identified him 
as francisco pascual 41 a member of the central committee of the 
communist party of the philippines de villa refused to identify 
the others or say where they were being held 
he told reporters that pascual and 40 other rebels were arrested 
in raids monday night in the northern province of pangasinan about 
110 miles northwest of manila 
de villa called the capture of the base and the guerrillas a 
crippling blow to the 19yearold communist insurgency 
he said pascual was in charge of party activities in the central 
luzon region north of manila and was among rebel and government 
officials who supervised a twomonth ceasefire that ended in 
february 1987 
peace talks between the rebels and the government of president 
corazon aquino broke down in january 1987 and fighting resumed 
immediately after the truce expired a few weeks later 
brig gen orlando antonio a regional commander who also 
attended the news conference said troops confiscated more than 
2000 sticks of dynamite in a separate sweep in baguio city a 
mountain resort north of pangasinan 
antonio said pascual was arrested while on his way to a rebel 
hideout in dagupan in pangasinan antonio said soldiers seized 
assorted documents a computer and radio equipment powerful enough 
to transmit messages to much of central and northern luzon at the 
base 
what we captured in dagupan was actually an underground house 
of the military staff said pangasinan provincial commander col 
romeo odi in other words they were orchestrating their 
operations from that particular communications center and so 
with that capture we are able to paralyze their operations 
officials said the rebels planned to use the explosives to blow 
up bridges and other targets in luzons cagayan valley a rebel 
stronghold 
pascuals arrest brings to at least five the number of central 
committee members captured by the military this year among those 
were party general secretary rafael baylosis and romulo kintanar 
chief of the communist new peoples army 
with the arrest of mr francisco pascual the rebel 
leadership as well as the entire organization is dealt another 
crippling blow by the government de villa said

chicagos yuppie tax on racquetball 
and health club memberships violates the state constitutions 
restriction on occupation taxes the state supreme court has ruled 
the city needs approval from the state legislature to impose its 
4 percent levy on club membership fees the court said monday 
the city has gone far beyond merely taxing particular 
activities and has imposed a tax unique to those types of 
commercial enterprises justice joseph cunningham wrote in the 
opinion 
the court also said that the tax could not be viewed as a valid 
levy on amusements since the clubs offer a wide variety of 
nonamusement activities such as nutrition instruction and diet 
counseling 
the decision reversed an appellate court ruling but affirmed a 
circuit court decision in a case brought by a group of chicago 
health clubs

the volume of water flowing in streams and 
rivers fell well below normal over half the nation during may the 
us geological survey reported today 
the low streamflows reflected the drought plaguing large areas 
of the country 
the saline river at rye ark dropped to only 10 percent of 
normal flow for the month and there was only 15 percent of normal 
water in the tombigbe river at coatopa ala 
the survey reported streamflows of only 21 percent of normal in 
the peace river at arcadia fla and the buffalo river near st 
joe ark 
the french broad river at asheville nc at 40 percent of 
normal also set a record low flow for the month 
the survey reported that the combined flow of the nations three 
largest rivers the mississippi st lawrence and columbia 
averaged 617 billion gallons per day during the month 37 percent 
below normal and the second lowest combined flow in 60 years these 
three rivers drain about half of the contiguous 48 states 
regionally streamflows were lowest in california in may at 42 
percent below average for the month flows were down 40 percent in 
the great basin of nevada and utah 29 percent in the pacific 
northwest and 18 percent in the southeast 
turning to underground water supplies as measured in wells 
water levels fell in the southeast and southwest new lows were 
recorded in memphis tenn montgomery ala and jackson la

water flows across the nation are damaging to navigation hydro 
power natural resources and recreation 
in the southeastern part of the country low water resulted in a 
33 percent deficiency in power generation last week said bob page 
assistant secretary of the army for civil works 
he said that generation problems are also being experienced at 
plants in the pacific northwest but added that he does not 
anticipate any power shortages because power is being obtained from

six environmental organizations and a trade 
association say the environmental protection agencys superfund 
toxic waste cleanup program ignores the intent of congress 
the groups told a house subcommittee monday that epa has ignored 
1986 amendments intended to settle the question how clean is clean 
those amendments directed epa to use relevant and 
appropriate pollution standards contained in other laws such as 
the safe drinking water act in setting cleanup goals 
but epa uses confusing risk assessments that leave varying 
amounts of contaminants in the ground according to a report from 
the hazardous waste treatment council a trade association and the 
sierra club the national audubon society the natural resources 
defense council the national wildlife federation the 
environmental defense fund and the us public interest research 
group 
much of the report echoed findings of a study by the 
congressional office of technology assessment last friday that epa 
is ignoring another provision of the amendments that it prefer 
permanent remedies in cleanups over simply containing the waste in 
the ground or moving it to a landfill that might need to be cleaned 
up later 
different residual contamination doesnt necessarily mean 
cleanups fail to protect health and the environment said j 
winston porter assistant epa administrator in charge of superfund 
in testimony before the investigations subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee 
different exposures and resources at risk might well justify 
different cleanup levels he said porter is in charge of three 
dioxin cleanups and ill be using different action levels at all 
three he said 
in its examples the report cited lead at the schmaltz dump in 
harrison wis and at rose township mich 
we learn from the schmaltz dump wis record of decision that 
soil lead concentrations greater than 14 parts per million pose an 
unacceptable lifetime risk from direct contact the rose township 
mich site set a level for lead in soil that is five times higher 
than at schmaltz and other sites permit an even higher 
concentration 100 ppm the report said 
the explanation in wisconsin children under three are assumed 
to eat one gram of dirt a day in michigan children are assumed to 
have no access to the site 
walter kovalik deputy director of the superfund office said 
the agency was in the process of forcing its regional offices to 
use common exposure assumptions

antiestablishment vagabonds clashed 
with police before dawn today as a crowd of 4000 tried to reach 
the ancient stonehenge monument to celebrate the summer solstice 
police said about 70 people were arrested and 10 were injured 
after the vagabonds pelted police with stones bottles and other 
debris in an attempt to break police lines around the site the 
injured included eight policemen and two hippies 
the estimated 4000 vagabonds were quickly driven back by the 
1000 riot police carrying shields and truncheons and later obeyed 
police orders to move off an illegal camping site nearby 
it seems to have quieted down inspector stephen chandler of 
the police in devizes about 15 miles north of stonehenge said 
the tents have started coming down the shelters started coming 
apart 
were not expecting more problems he said adding that the 
hippies were leaving the site in small groups 
the arrests were made about one hour before 60 whiterobed 
modernday druid sun worshipers celebrated the summer solstice the 
longest day of the year with a ritual sunrise ceremony at 
stonehenge at 447 am 
the ceremony at the 4000yearold site culminated with the 
blowing of rams horn trumpets 
the governmentfunded english heritage which manages the site 
said the vagabonds had earlier this week refused an offer of 1100 
tickets to attend the ceremony under escort 
stonehenge is a mysterious double circle of gigantic standing 
stones set in salisbury plain about 80 miles southwest of london 
it is thought to have been a center for prechristian and 
astronomical worship since the sun rises over a certain stone 
the vagabonds sometimes referred to as hippies in britain 
because of their 1960s lifestyle wander the countryside of 
southwestern england in a ragtag convoy of vehicles 
in the past they have held loosely organized music festivals at 
stonehenge coinciding with the solstice when the sun reaches its 
greatest distance from the equator 
the festivals held since the early 1970s have been banned 
since 1985 because of complaints of drugtaking and property damage 
in previous years

the environmental protection agency today 
proposed to add 229 sites to the superfund priority list for 
toxic waste cleanups and to drop 30 
the action brings the priority list to 1177 sites of which 378 
are still proposals and 799 have been formally designated for the 
list 
eventually the agency has said the list could grow to about 
2500 sites 
fourteen of todays new sites are owned by other federal 
agencies 12 of them either related to nuclear weapons manufacture 
or a military base last week epa announced agreement with the 
defense department on penalties to be imposed if the department 
fails to live up to cleanup agreements 
the 30 sites being proposed for deletion have not been cleaned 
up but do not satisfy any of the criteria for listing epa 
said they will be cleaned up under other programs the agency said 
three other sites were deleted from the list in april on the 
grounds that all work had been completed or that they posed no 
threat epa said 
designation for the national priority list means the site is 
eligible for 90 percent federal financing of the cleanup under 
epas supervision unless a federal agency owns it federal 
agencies are responsible for cleaning up their sites using their 
own money 
six environmental organizations and a trade association told a 
house subcommittee monday that the superfund program has ignored

israelis shot and wounded two arab youths 
today including a 10yearold boy who was shot by a civilian 
firing at a stonethrowing mob in the west bank hospital officials 
said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said all israelis not just the 
army must defend the occupied territories and he said he was 
right to encourage civilians to open fire on arabs armed with 
firebombs 
rabin also said that a jewish farmer found stabbed and 
bludgeoned to death monday should have carried a weapon police 
blamed palestinian activists for the slaying 
the army confirmed an israeli civilian was stoned in nablus in 
the west bank it said the man told the military that he fired in 
the air to disperse the attackers army officials said they had no 
reports of injuries as a result of the shooting 
officials at al ittihad hospital in nablus said the boy was shot 
in the leg 
the second reported injury involved a 16yearold arab who was 
shot in the shoulder during a clash with troops in the village of 
burka near nablus said officials at al ittihad 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity quoted burka 
residents as saying the army clamped a curfew on the village and 
rounded up all men over 16 at the local schoolyard 
the army confirmed a burka resident was injured in a clash with 
troops but it would not provide further details 
we are in a prolonged war of independence and everyone has 
to be aware prepared equipped rabin said today 
he spoke a day after eli cohen 33 was found dead in a field 
near moshav shekev a communal farm inside israel and bordering the 
west bank 
cohen was the fourth israeli to be killed during the arab 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip which began dec 
8 at least 210 palestinians have died 
rabin in an interview with the associated press said he was 
really sorry that cohen did not have the weapon that we would 
have hoped he would 
i believe the whole results would be entirely different he 
would be alive today said rabin who has been criticized for 
encouraging israelis to carry weapons to defend themselves against 
arabs 
cohen left home sunday evening to spray insecticide on his 
vineyard and never returned said farm spokeswoman etti elinsky 
his body was found nearby on monday police said he was stabbed in 
the back and beaten apparently with an iron rod and his head was 
crushed 
twenty arabs were detained and security forces clamped curfews 
on two nearby arab villages 
in a stormy meeting monday night commune members decided they 
would no longer employ arab laborers the farms security officer 
david elinsky told israel radio 
we decided that we will do the job ourselves with the help of 
volunteers even though this will hurt us economically elinsky 
said he did not say how many arabs work for the farm 
thousands of arabs many from the lands seized in the 1967 
middle east war work in israels agricultural sector which has 
come to depend on the cheap source of labor 
earlier monday elinsky had said farm residents were considering 
retaliatory measures against their arab neighbors including 
barring them from using roads leading into israel 
on second thought we decided not to take the law into our 
hands and to cooperate with the security forces he said after 
the meeting 
but residents complained that the army has ignored requests to 
set up patrols following acts of vandalism in the area blamed on 
arabs 
residents vented their anger on maj gen amram mitzna head of 
the west bank military command who some tried to prevent from 
entering the farm 
mitzna told the farmers the war here is a lot more complicted 
and difficult but its likely that this was a terrorist 
attack and we will do everything we can 
prime minister yitzhak shamir called the slaying a serious 
incident he said if it indeed was carried out by palestinian 
militants israel would respond harshly

penalty again for a man convicted for a second time in the deaths 
of two police officers 
lets go for it all the way said patricia fahey the wife 
of officer william fahey who was shot to death with his partner 
richard obrien during a traffic stop in 1982 
a sentencing hearing begins today for andrew wilson who was 
convicted by a circuit court jury on monday wilsons 1983 
conviction in the case was overturned last year by the illinois 
supreme court which ruled that a confession has been beaten out of 
him 
wilsons brother jackie was also convicted in the officers 
slaying but his conviction and life prison term also were 
overturned because he didnt receive a separate trial he is 
awaiting a retrial 
prosecution witness derrick martin testified in both trials that 
the wilson brothers let him out of a car two blocks from the 
shooting scene just before the officers were shot 
during the second trial however justice r eugene pincham of 
the illinois appellate court testified that martin had told him he 
lied at the first trial 
martin also said andrew wilson told him he wanted to get some 
police uniforms to help a friend escape from jail martin said 
wilson told him a few days later that he had killed the officers 
the defense insisted wilson was not in the car even though his 
eyeglasses were found at the scene

rallies 
five police personnel were killed and 26 others seriously 
wounded as a result of an attack by unruly mob armed with swords 
sticks and catapults the broadcast said a member of the mob 
also was killed and several others wounded

necessary to impose a curfew and ban public meetings and 
demonstrations within the rangoon municipal area it said 
the broadcast said the mob set fire to one police station and 
the family quarters of another station they damaged 
governmentowned buildings and traffic light posts it said 
the government monday announced that classes at rangoon arts and

of the arts and science university marched from campus toward 
downtown rangoon high school students joined them 
about 200 riot police swung batons and hurled stones to stop the 
marchers about two miles south of the campus witnesses said 
they said the demonstrators who had grown to 5000 strong 
hurled stones and other objects and forced police to retreat a 
block south to a military barricade 
the protesters then dispersed in small groups 
in the nearby sanchaung area of the city there were sporadic 
clashes between protesters and police who reportedly used tear gas 
and firearms it was not immediately clear if there were casualties 
in those clashes 
throughout last week students held antigovernment rallies at 
the university and put up posters that demanded the legalization of 
student unions and the release of students who had been detained in 
earlier protests 
several days of student unrest at rangoon universities climaxed 
on march 18 with antigovernment riots that police and military 
units rapidly crushed 
according to diplomatic sources in bangkok thailand as many as 
100 people may have died in the march 18 violence the government

for a new 140 million central library building in a departure from 
the steelandglass box architecture that marks the citys skyline

the united states will be named after mayor harold washington who 
died last year

developers and builders the project has been debated since 1976 
the citys library board was expected to give its endorsement 
today the new library will cost 140 million and is scheduled for 
completion in 1991 
the majority felt it was the one most consistent with the 
architecture in the area said norman ross the jurys chairman 
it feels like a library to many people and it relates to the 
surrounding great architecture 
the buildings classical design reflects such historic loop 
landmarks as the art institute and the auditorium building 
the plans call for a 10story building with a pink granite and 
brick facade multistory arched windows an array of skylights and 
a large lobby it will include a 400seat auditorium and skylit 
gardens

been stored in a warehouse since 1974 when it was moved from a 
central library building built in 1897 the building built in 1897 
replaced a library destroyed in the great chicago fire of 1871 but 
the replacement was deemed inadequate within two decades

almost half of american school children have 
never experienced a single tooth cavity and the rest are showing a 
significant decline in dental decay according to a study released 
today by the national institute of dental research 
the study which involved dental examinations of about 40000 
school children aged 5 to 17 coasttocoast showed that 499 
percent had teeth with absolutely no decay 
and among the others institute officials said decayed tooth 
surfaces had declined by 35 to 36 percent 
dr james p carlos chief of the institutes epidemiology 
branch in suburban bethesda md said that decay between the 
teeth which is the most difficult to treat has practically been 
eradicated 
speaking of tooth decay carlos said this disease which once 
was probably the most chronic disease of childhood is being 
decreased very fast 
it is declining 35 to 36 percent every seven years and now 
half of the children in the country have never even experienced 
dental decay he said 
carlos attributed the decline in tooth decay to the increasingly 
widespread use of fluoride in the nations water supply in 
toothpaste and in mouthwash 
he said that american children are also receiving a high level 
of dental care as evidenced by the survey findings that more than 
82 percent of the tooth surfaces that have decayed had been filled 
when examined for the study 
he also said that only 43 percent of the children showed 
missing teeth indicating that more and more children are keeping 
their teeth 
carlos said that he expects the trend to continue although a 
complete eradication of decay is probably not possible 
as successive groups of children move through they seem to 
have less and less decay said carlos

conditioners to public shelters and added to the woes of 
droughtplagued farmers 
high temperatures today will be in the 90s across most of the 
nation the national weather service said temperatures didnt have 
far to go on the plains with the overnight low at a warm 77 at 
bismarck nd 
nearly 40 cities in the central and eastern united states set 
temperature records monday as the earlyseason heat continued to 
intensify according to the weather service 
temperatures soared above 100 degrees across much of the 
northern and central plains the upper mississippi valley and the 
desert southwest highs in the 90s were common elsewhere across the 
nation except for coastal and mountain areas 
authorities in several areas opened up shelters monday to 
residents without air conditioners in chicago where it reached 
104 city officials invited the public to use the citys libraries 
and other airconditoned municipal buildings during daytime hours 
to escape the heat the chicago temperature reading tied the record 
for the month of june 
customers of chicagos commonwealth edison co set a singleday 
record for electricity usage said spokesman john hogan while 
consumers power co in michican set a usage record for the month 
the heat caused discomfort for people with breathing 
difficulties and heart conditions and prompted authorities in the 
chicago area and in wisconsin to post ozone advisories cautioning 
people with those conditions to remain in airconditioned rooms 
the heat also proved dangerous to animals forecasters said the 
livestock weather safety index entered the emergency zone in 
several parts of midwest and plains farmers were advised to keep 
animals in shade and provide plenty of water 
animals react to the heat in the same way humans do said 
michigan department of agriculture specialist edwin renkie it 
does affect the animals and in some cases can kill them 
heat distorted railroad tracks in mobridge sd last weekend 
causing five cars of a burlington northern train loaded with corn 
to derail said spokesman al wiegold in st paul minn

vermont ohio missouri north and south dakota nebraska 
minnesota and illinois the weather service said 
agricultural experts said the heat is adding to the problems of 
the drought in the midwest and the plains by evaporating what 
little moisture remains in the soil 
these real hot days 95 to 100 degrees are using more 
moisture than we can stand to lose said harold hunzicker 
agricultural adviser in marion county in southern illinois were 
still hanging in there but that is not to say we couldnt have a 
disaster

congress should speed aid to farmers hard hit 
by drought that has caused 18 billion in crop damage and left a 
brown and brittle land in its path the senate agriculture 
committee chairman said today 
youve got to be giving some help to these people to say hang 
on sen patrick j leahy dvt told a news conference 
at what point do they sit around the kitchen table and start to 
say i cant take it anymore i dont want that to happen 
leahy who headed a threestate tour of droughtstricken wheat 
lands over the weekend said the bipartisan task force of lawmakers 
and administration officials that has been monitoring the drought 
should sit down on wednesday and come up with a blueprint for aid 
to farmers 
he said he had some thoughts about what the package should 
contain but added that all of the task force members should have 
their say before any type of drought relief legislation is unveiled 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng told lawmakers last week 
that they should be ready to produce legislation but not make 
anything final until after the full extent of the problem is 
understood 
leahy said it was not too soon to start shaping an aid package 
he said the drought has not only caused 18 billion in crop 
damage on their foray to montana and both dakotas over the 
weekend he said the lawmakers found that the blazing sun and 
shortage of rainfall had left a moonscape and a brown and 
brittle land 
what i saw was not a disaster in the making leahy said 
what i saw was a disaster now 
even if the task force reaches a consensus this week on the 
shape of an aid package it would most likely take weeks or longer 
to get the bill to president reagans desk thus far urban 
lawmakers who are persistent critics of agricultural subsidies have 
held their fire amid the outcry from the farm belt for drought aid 
the senate appropriations committee balked on monday at a 
proposal to guarantee 92 percent of federal incomesupport payments 
to wheat feed grains upland cotton and rice producers whose crops 
are wiped out by the drought 
sen quentin burdick dnd proposed the measure saying the 
situation in his home state already was grim but other panel 
members said it was still too early to act and that his proposal 
would have provided no aid to producers of crops not covered by 
usda programs 
in the end the panel did not vote on the proposal and instead 
voted to attach a sense of congress resolution calling for 
drought aid in a 473 billion agriculture appropriation bill for 
the fiscal year starting oct 1

an american representative of union 
carbide corp today accused the indian government of delaying a 
settlement in the 1984 bhopal gas disaster and said the company 
would begin settling with individuals 
we are frustrated because of the attitude of the government 
the political will is not there to settle the case said the 
representative speaking on condition of anonymity 
they talk about settling the case out of court but do not have 
the authority from the top to do so he said we will settle 
with individuals they all have their own lawyers 
about 523000 people have filed claims in the bhopal district 
court union carbide lawyers say the government attorneys have not 
yet certified if the claims are true 
nearly 3000 people died and 20000 were seriously injured when 
methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a union carbide subsidiarys 
plant in bhopal in december 1984 it was the worlds worst 
industrial disaster 
the indian government filed a 3 billion compensation suit 
against the danbury connbased multinational but the case still 
is at the pretrial stage 
the indian government also passed a law making it the sole legal 
representative of the victims 
when asked if the settlement with the victims would be legal in 
view of the law the union carbide source said the case can be 
settled in the united states there is no law to prevent that 
however hk khan secretary of indias chemicals and 
petrochemicals ministry said union carbide could not settle 
directly with the victims 
the government last week requested the bhopal court to issue an 
injunction blocking union carbide from such a move 
judge mw deo is to rule on the application july 29 
khan said the indian government had to go back to court 
because there was no proper offer forthcoming from carbide for an 
outofcourt settlement 
he refused to discuss figures 
sources close to union carbide said in november 1987 that the 
company was willing to pay 650 million in an outofcourt 
settlement but the indian government was pressing for more

secretary in balloting by the central committee and the central 
control commission the vote was 2783 with five abstentions 
occhetto was the only candidate 
he succeeds alessandro natta who suffered a heart attack in

worst election defeat in 20 years slipping to 266 percent of the 
vote for the chamber of deputies in parliament last month the 
communists won only 219 percent of the vote in local elections 
occhetto on monday noted that the partys traditional base of 
support had shrunk and pledged to work for a new communist

security forces arrested two white 
south african soldiers after a shootout in which south african 
commandos injured three botswanan policemen the presidents office 
said today 
the statement said the shooting occurred late monday when six 
unarmed police officers were fired at by five south african 
commandos who were planning a raid on a target in gaborone the 
capital 
south african commandos have staged numerous crossborder raids 
in the past on botswana and other neighboring countries to attack 
suspected hideouts and bases of the african national congress the 
anc is the main guerrilla movement fighting south africas 
government 
the commandos escaped but police said two south african 
soldiers were later arrested at an army roadblock and were being 
questioned authorities said the soldiers were driving away from 
the scene of the shootout they identified the soldiers as corp 
johannes basson 25 and national serviceman theodore hermanhen 
both of johannesburg 
it wasnt clear if the escaped commandos also were soldiers 
the announcement came hours after gaborone police announced that 
a car bomb had exploded early today near the home of a building 
contractor in the capital 
the presidential statement said the bombing was yet another 
south african attempt on the lives of innocent batswana 
the south african military said botswanas allegations were 
being investigated to establish the facts before any other 
public comment was made 
the statement issued by president quett masires office said the 
shootout occurred at 1030 pm monday when the sixman police 
patrol was surprised by five south african commandos about four 
miles south of gaborone 
these commandos three whites and two blacks fled in a stolen 
botswana police vehicle which was found abandoned at the south 
african border the statement said 
the bomb went off at 6 am today under a car belonging to 
contractor allison seeketso parked outside his house the 
statement said 
fortunately neither mr seeketso his wife nor any of his 
four children who were sleeping in the house were injured it 
said 
it could not immediately be determined if seketso is in any way 
affiliated with the anc 
the statement said botswana reiterates its position that the 
problems of apartheid in south africa will not be solved by 
crossborder raids murder of innocent civilians and shooting of 
unarmed policemen in cold blood 
we once more condemn those acts of state terrorism by the 
south african government 
south african commandos have conducted several raids in gaborone 
against people they say are black nationalist guerrillas using the 
botswana capital as a staging post for sabotage attacks in south 
africa 
south african soldiers killed three women and one man in march 
when they raided a house and waged a gun battle on the edge of the 
city 
south africans killed one person in a may 1986 attack against 
alleged hideouts of anc guerrillas fifteen were killed in a june 
1985 south african raid 
botswana officials have often denied the presence of anc 
guerrillas although the government is sympathetic to the ancs 
aims 
the anc seeks to end the apartheid system of racesegregation 
to install a oneman onevote political system and to establish 
government controls over major economic sectors

defense minister yitzhak rabin said 
tuesday he will tell us critics of israel that his country has to 
respond forcefully to an arab rebellion if it wants to remain an 
independent state 
palestinian leaders of the 6month uprising have farreaching 
political goals that can endanger israels future and its 
security rabin said in an interview with the associated press 
if we would like to remain an independent jewish state we 
must be strong rabin said we cannot accept the present level 
of violence against us 
he also said all israelis and not just the army had the job of 
defending towns and settlements 
we have to try together the military and the civilians to 
take all the measures needed to put down the violence he said 
in his office within the walled defense ministry compound in tel 
aviv everyone has to be aware prepared equipped 
the 66yearold former israeli prime minister and army chief of 
staff is scheduled to go to the united states in the next few days 
to meet with officials including president reagan his itinerary 
was not revealed for security reasons 
us officials have expressed disapproval of some israeli 
tactics to quell arab unrest in the occupied territories and are 
expected to voice their concerns to rabin during his visit 
most recently they have questioned rabins statements 
encouraging civilians to carry weapons and open fire on arabs armed 
with firebombs 
but rabin said he was right to urge civilians to shoot in 
selfdefense and added that if an israeli farmer killed this week 
had been carrying a gun he would still be alive today 
i am really sorry the farmer who was attacked and viciously 
killed did not have the weapon that we would have hoped he would 
rabin said i believe the results would be entirely different he 
would be alive today 
the body of eli cohen 33 was found monday in his vineyard 
south of jerusalem he had been bludgeoned and stabbed to death 
and police have blamed arab nationalists for the attack 
in a way rabin said we can call the last 40 years the 
continuing war of independence and we are determined to meet 
violence by force 
rabin also disclosed he had met four times in recent weeks with 
more than a dozen palestinian leaders from the occupied territories 
and said the sessions were fruitful simply because they kept the 
channels of communication open 
it was not in the format of negotiations we just exchanged 
views sometimes conflicting views rabin said 
he declined to identify them saying some of those with whom he 
had met had received death threats but he said the palestinians 
represent a wide variety of opinions 
he stressed that none of them is formally a member of any of 
the plo organizations 
israel views the palestine liberation organization as a 
terrorist group and has outlawed meetings between israelis and plo 
representatives

as a charity when raising money to pay medical bills for her sons

that remained in ronnies account when he died has been spent

a splinter group within the 
striking writers guild of america announced today it would oppose 
the union leadership and call for approval of the latest producers 
offer to end the 16weekold strike 
about 300 members of the writers coalition met monday night and 
voted to oppose the guild at wednesday night membership meetings in 
new york and los angeles where the contract will be voted on 
the feeling that came out of the meeting is that the board and 
negotiating committee are very much out of touch with the guild 
membership said publicist and guild member dick guttman who 
attended the writers coalition meeting 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers offered 
a 71 million contract last thursday but the writers guild said 
the economic package on foreign and onehour residuals was 
unacceptable 
writers guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden who said union 
officials were aware of the coalition meeting monday night today 
urged members to wait until wednesday nights meeting to hear the 
presentation on the proposal before they give their proxies to 
anyone to vote 
the coalition claims about 600 members within the 9000member 
union but its members are among the guilds most frequently 
employed and therefore the biggest contributors to its health 
welfare and pension fund coalition leaders have said 
it also includes several of the industrys top hyphenates 
writerproducers who hold union cards but also have become 
management by starting their own production companies 
among those in the coalition are la law producerwriter 
steve bochco stephen cannell who produces hunter and john 
hughes producer and writer of such films as the great outdoors 
and planes trains and automobiles 
the coalition has been working behind the scenes since the 
beginning of the strike but made no public pronouncements until 
last week when the unions negotiating committee and east and west 
coast boards decided to reject the producers latest offer 
the strike vote on wednesday comes on the eve of the new 
television production season

the government has sent to parliament a 
bill allowing conscientious objectors to the draft to serve three 
years of alternative civilian service a spokesman said tuesday 
the alternative service for males exempted from military duty 
will be shorter than outlined earlier this year said government 
spokesman jerzy urban 
in january the government said it was considering requiring 
draftees who qualified for alternative service to perform four 
years of alternative service 
under a bill approved by the council of ministers on monday 
however it will last three years while students released from 
military obligations will be required to serve only one to two 
years urban said 
a military commission that will include civilian participants 
will be established to consider the requests to determine the 
authenticity of the applicants motives urban said 
current law mandates that all young men perform up to two years 
of military service 
the banned peace group freedom and peace has campaigned for the 
establishment of alternative service since the group was formed in 
1985 
only last week the group scored its greatest success to date 
when parliament adopted a new military oath that drops any 
reference to serving alongside the soviet army 
urban refused to comment on the fate of 16 members of the group 
which the group says are imprisoned either for refusing to serve in 
the army or to take the oath 
the supreme military court in warsaw on tuesday upheld the 
2year sentence of freedom and peace supporter rafal budzbon a

president reagan has given his support to 
compromise legislation to strengthen enforcement of 
antidiscrimination laws in housing a republican leader said 
tuesday 
rep robert h michel rill the house minority leader said 
tuesday that reagan told him from by telephone from the toronto 
economic summit that he believes the agreement between 
congressional liberals and conservatives as well as between civil 
rights groups and real estate agents preserves the 
constitutional right to jury trials and he hopes the congreess 
will move quickly on the legislation to strengthen fair housing 
laws 
michel made his comments at a news conference attended by 
congressional leaders the leadership conference on civil rights 
and the national association of realtors 
the house should take up the fair housing legislation either 
wednesday afternoon or thursday the senate also is expected to act 
quickly after the house approves the measure 
the house judiciary committee approved legislation on april 27 
which would authorize the department of housing and urban 
development to levy fines and issue injunctions against people who 
discriminate in the rental or sale of housing 
under current law hud can play only a conciliatory role 
attempting to mediate housing disputes enforcement of the law 
depends on private individuals who can take a discrimination case 
to court and on the justice department which has authority to 
prosecute if there is evidence of a pattern or practice of 
housing discrimiantion 
the bill sets up a new system of administrative law judges who 
would hear cases of alleged housing discrimination if a party were 
dissatisfied with the decision he or she then could go to federal 
court 
the reagan administration and the realtors contended that the 
process was constitutionally flawed because it would subject a 
defendant to fines without benefit of a jury trial as required 
under the constitutions 7th amendement 
the compromise to come as an amendment proposed by rep 
hamilton fish jr rny will provide that any party charged with 
housing discrimination can elect to have the accusation litigated 
in federal court if no such election is made the case will be 
handled by the administrative process 
rep don edwards chairman of the house judiciary civil and 
constitutional rights subcommittee said we believe the bill 
will do the job of putting teeth into fair housing law 
besides putting teeth into fair housing laws it provides 
antidiscrimination protection to individuals with handicaps and to 
families with children edwards told the news conference these 
new classes need protection as our long study of the matter has 
clearly pointed out these provisions are an essential part of the 
bill 
nestor r weigand jr president of the realtors said the 
compromise was a milestone in the history of fair housing 
legislation our respective organizations have been able to 
overcome their disagreements of the past decade and come to an 
agreement that will ensure free and equal access to housing for all 
americans as well as expedite enforcement proceedings in fair 
housing disputes 
sens bob dole rkan the senate minority leader and edward 
m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and human 
resources committee each said he expects the senate to act 
promptly and complete action on the bill before congress recesses 
for the year

a nobel prizewinning american professor will 
become master of the oxford university college where he once taught 
and studied officials said tuesday 
baruch blumberg a professor of medecine and anthropology at the 
university of pennsylvania will take over the post at balliol 
college next year when the present master anthony kenny steps 
down according to a balliol official who asked not to be 
identified 
its in recognition of the international character 
of balliol that i was chosen blumberg was quoted as telling 
the times of london from his home in philadelphia 
he said he was e i believe xcited and honored to have been 
chosen 
an oxford spokeswoman anne lonsdale said it was believed that 
blumberg would be the first american to head balliol but the 
balliol official was unsure americans currently are masters of 
three of oxfords other 34 colleges 
according to oxfords college system students live and work at 
one college during their course of study and undergraduates apply 
to individual colleges rather than to the university for admission 
blumberg received a doctor of philosophy in biochemistry in 1955 
from balliol and taught there as a visiting professor in 198384 
said the official reading from a statement 
in 1976 blumberg won a nobel prize in physiology and medecine 
fore over days lost to 
strikes have fallen from 29 million in 1979 to just 25 million in 
the year up to march 
unemployment is one reason but another is prime minister 
margaret thatchers legislation which forces unions to take strike 
votes and obtain a 55percent yesvote before calling a walkout 
the legislation also outlaws secondary picketing and no longer 
requires employers to recognize a union even if employees have 
chosen it in a vote 
the trades union congress is threatening to expel the eetpu 
electricians at its annual meeting in september over singleunion 
deals 
at the same time the eetpu is asking its members in a ballot 
whether to pull out of the tuc and talking to the aeu about joining 
forces to form their own breakaway organization that would take 
away oneninth of the tucs membership 
such a split in the union movement would change the face of 
industrial relations and have serious implications for the labor 
party the independent newspaper wrote 
the labor party is the main opposition to mrs thatchers 
conservative party government and the unions are the laborites 
power base 
the wakefield factory which is europes newest softdrink 
plant is going to mean a lot for the community of wakefield 
said mayor george parkinson 
dick croft a local official for the engineering union that will 
represent the wakefield plant workers said the community was lucky 
that coke and cadbury decided to have any union at all 
the new style has been introduced largely by egalitarianminded 
japanese companies that have abolished separate dress codes put in 
employee canteens and provided parking lots for hourly workers as 
well as for management 
they offer enticing wages in return for high productivity and 
shopfloor moderation british workers have embraced the change 
confounding those who accuse them of resisting change and upholding 
class distinctions 
norman willis the tucs general secretary argues that 
singleunion deals encourage damaging competition among unions for 
a smaller pool of members in the trade union movement 
the 135millionmember transport and general workers union 
britains largest also is a major opponent of the new style for 
pretty much the same reasons 
but up here in yorkshire the engineering unions croft said 
the world is changing we dont enjoy the same franchise we had a 
few years ago

tourists standing in line at the washington 
monument flinched in surprise tuesday as federal safety officials 
blew two dressed turkeys to bits in a demonstration of the dangers 
of fireworks 
a pair of watermelons also met their end as the consumer product 
safety commission used the monument grounds to conduct its annual 
prefourth of july event for the news media 
this july 4th marks uncle sams 212th birthday what better 
way to celebrate than to make sure that fireworks do not spoil the 
occasion commission chairman terrence m scanlon said 
federal and state laws ban firecrackers with more than 50 
milligrams of powder the small fingertype firecrackers but 
agency officials acknowledge that large illegal items such as 
cherry bombs m80 and m100s can still be obtained 
the m100s were used to blast the thawed turkeys blowing them 
apart and scattering pieces about the birds were used to simulate 
what could happen to a human being 
the effect on the watermelons was similar if more colorful 
the safety commission also announced that during the last five 
months it has seized some 57 million units of illegal fireworks in 
a cooperative program with the us customs service at 15 ports of 
entry 
problems found in the products included overloaded fireworks 
defective fuses unstable bases casings which blow out on the side 
and improper warning labels 
the commission said approximately 9000 injuries involving 
fireworks were treated at hospital emergency rooms last year down 
from 12600 in 1986 
to avoid becoming one of those statistics scanlon offered a 
series of safety tips 
always read and follow label instructions 
ignite fireworks outdoors only 
make sure an an adult is present whenever fireworks are used 
have a bucket of water at hand in the event of a fire and for 
dousing apparent duds 
never try to relight a firework that does not go off 
never carry fireworks in a pocket and dont throw them 
light only one at a time 
do not set off fireworks in a metal or glass container

traditionalist archbishop marcel 
lefebvre said tuesday that cooperation with the vatican is no 
longer possible and he reaffirmed his decision to consecrate four 
bishops without papal authority 
lefebvre announcement last week to consecrate the bishops on 
june 30 drew public warnings from pope john paul ii and european 
roman catholic church leaders 
elevating bishops without papal permission seems certain to 
result in the frenchmans excommunication from the church and its 
first split since an 1870 schism over the dogma of papal 
infallibility 
in a statement the 82yearold lefebvre accused the vatican of 
continuous and cruel persecution to force our submission to the 
reforms launched by the second vatican council in 196265 
the church will need years to find its way back to its 
2000yearold tradition the founder and leader of the 
traditionalist st pius x fraternity in switzerland said the 
movement will defend this tradition which is the only 
possibility for the renewal of the church he said 
the relationship with the vatican no longer in any way points 
to brotherly cooperation and a pure and simple recognition of the 
fraternity lefebvre said 
he has said the consecration of four of his followers is needed 
to ensure the survival of his movement which claims millions of 
followers worldwide 
according to the vatican a may 5 agreement between the pope and 
lefebvre gave the archbishop the right to consecrate one bishop on 
aug 15 in return lefebvre would have promised to be faithful to 
the church and the pope and accept the teachings of the second 
vatican council 
lefebvre insisted on the june 30 date and on elevating four 
bishops effectively repudiating the accord 
on thursday the vatican published the text of a letter from the 
pope to lefebvre that urged him to renounce the schismatic act 
the presidents of the french west german and swiss bishops 
conferences did the same 
lefebvre whose movement uses the latinlanguage tridentine 
mass has spoken out for some two decades against the second 
vatican council 
the council led to the celebration of mass in local languages 
an enlargement of the role of lay people and opening of the church 
to other faiths 
excommunication is the last sanction left in the vaticans 
arsenal of measures against lefebvre 
in 1976 pope paul vi suspended him from his priestly functions 
barring him from saying mass and giving the sacraments but 
lefebvre ignored the order he continued to ordain priests and 
criticize the vatican

a new agreement with japan on beef and oranges 
will be a positive element in general trade negotiations 
particularly with the european economic community us trade 
representative clayton yeutter said tuesday 
it should provide some additional psychological support for us 
in dealing with the europeans yeutter said in other words 
now that weve been able to strike a deal with the japanese on beef 
and citrus it puts some additional pressure on the europeans to be 
somewhat more accommodating than they have in the past 
with the japanese starting to come into line it could put eec 
leaders in the position of looking like the villains of the 
agricultural world if they continue holding out he said 
yeutter who earlier this week returned from tokyo where the new 
agreement was reached after marathon negotiations told a telephone 
conference with broadcast and newspaper reporters that japan agreed 
to open the door to more american beef and citrus in the face of 
further us challenges under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade or gatt 
the agreement could lead to a doubling of us exports of beef 
and oranges by 1991 to more than 1 billion a year in return the 
united states agreed to withdraw its gatt complaint against japan 
restrictive import quotas 
yeutter said the complaint and previous success under gatt 
rules last year helped prod japan into accepting an expansion of 
beef and citrus 
in other words the jig was up he said theyd gotten 
away with a continuation of these programs for a lot of years what 
we the united states should have done was challenge these things 
about 15 years ago instead of now but better late than never 
yeutter said he did not expect serious problems in japan living 
up to the new agreement although officials should be watchful 
i dont see any loopholes there for the government of japan to 
use three years or so in the future he said but one can never 
be sure governments are very creative on these kinds of things 
and theyll sometimes find loopholes or build loopholes where 
theyre not around today

the miss georgia beauty pageant has become the 
focus of squabbling btween state and local pageant officials 
rumors that the winner already has been picked and complaints that 
blacks cant win 
the pageant begins wednesday in columbus with atlantas entry 
dethroned and its pageant organization shut out and a 
representative of the miss america pageant is on hand to monitor 
proceedings 
critics say the miss georgia pageant has evolved into a 
competition dominated by professional pageant girls 
professionally coached and dressed in 2500 custommade evening 
gowns and 120 supersuits for the swimsuit competition who 
travel around the state easily winning titles in pageants without 
residency requirements 
the scholarship atlanta foundation inc which operates the miss 
atlanta pageant had its franchise lifted by the state group 
because it took the miss atlanta crown away from faith ann brown 
22 of kennesaw 
the atlanta board said miss brown violated her contract by 
working with an unauthorized talent coach the first and second 
runnersup had won other pageants so the crown went to third 
runnerup jennifer anderson of dunwoody 
scholarship atlanta complained to the miss america pageant 
officials saying the georgia pageant is tightly controlled no 
black has ever been awarded the crown and the 40member board has 
traditionally been allwhite and almost exclusively residents of 
the pageant host city 
then rumors surfaced that the new miss georgia already has been 
picked and simply will be confirmed this year miss atlanta board 
member kim styes foley wrote a letter to miss america officials 
contending frances frazier last years first runnerup and this 
years miss peachtree city said she has been promised the state 
crown 
thats just not true at all said miss frazier 26 a rome 
entertainer i have not been told by anybody that the crown would 
be mine 
in may lee york a member of the scholarship atlanta foundation 
and a former miss georgia board member also wrote to miss america 
officials saying he had firsthand knowledge blacks were not 
being given a fair shot at the crown 
miss georgia board president joe dickens acknowledged that the 
pageant has never had a black board member but said no black has 
ever applied 
lindsay barton vice president for franchises for miss georgia 
said he was insulted by the atlanta groups charge of racism last 
year a black female judge from atlantic city helped judge miss 
georgia and this year he said at least two of our hostesses 
happen to be black weve had a number of blacks in the 
competition and a lot have finished in the top 10 
the black contestant who finished highest in recent years 
barton said was kym clark who as miss peachtree city finished in 
the top 10 in 1985 
miss clark 28 a television reporter in memphis tenn says 
she encountered subtle racism but was reluctant to raise the issue 
i dont know if its the judges who dont want a black miss 
georgia or if its some of the pageant officials she said 
they pageant officials have a lot of influence with the 
judges 
james lees president of the board of directors of the miss 
america pageant said friday that a representative was sent to 
georgia 
the miss georgia pageant is among the most successful in the 
miss america system but georgia has not had a miss america since 
1953 when neva jane langley of macon won the title

a mississippi group has beat out 300 
competitors most of them based in new york los angeles and other 
big cities to win the contract for a major culturalexchange 
exhibit that will tour the soviet union 
this is the first time we have chosen a design group from the 
south said ron underwood project director for the us 
information agency the government office sponsoring the exhibit 
the exhibit called design usa will be produced by 
yoknapatawpha exhibit group usia officials announced monday the 
group is a joint venture of two jackson firms communication arts 
co a graphic design and media production studio and 
mockbeecokerhoworth architects 
the exhibit will showcase us architecture product design 
graphic design and design education it will tour nine soviet 
cities in 18 months starting in moscow next june 
in its proposal the group emphasized its mississippi 
background yoknapatawpha is the fictional mississippi county that 
was the setting for several works by nobel prizewinning novelist 
william faulkner 
jeanne b luckett vice president of communication arts noted 
the groups experience with the mississippi pavilion at the new 
orleans worlds fair she said the challenge there was to sell the 
attributes of a state that is often stereotyped and misunderstood 
we figured that if we could do that for mississippi we could 
do it for the united states to the soviets luckett said 
underwood said the usia liked the way the mississippi group 
grasped and expressed the exhibits concept the role design plays 
in the everyday life of americans 
he said the groups design model was far and away superior to 
any of the others and the others were done by some of the most 
highly thoughtof design firms in the country 
underwood said exhibit designers often think of the details 
instead of the big picture this group grasped the big picture and 
expressed it very effectively theyre just very creative people 
design usa is the second traveling usia exhibit to result from 
the 1985 cultural exchange agreement between president reagan and 
soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev the first which is 
touring the soviet union now deals with communications 
this is a wonderful opportunity for the people of america to 
touch the people of the soviet union in a very dynamic way said 
hap owen president of communication arts 
in this period of perestroika or rebuilding the soviets 
are open to new ways of designing and manufacturing they are 
realizing that their lifestyles products and built environments 
can be enhanced through better design 
we are not going to put on a trade show of products and 
services owen said we are seeking to explain how our society 
expresses itself through design and how therefore our quality of 
life is improved 
the cost of the design usa contract wont be known for several 
months components of the 13450squarefoot exhibit will fill 40 
18wheeler trucks

for fans of artist al hirschfeld there was a 
twist tuesday on his usual game 
a story in the new york times on tuesday hirschfelds 85th 
birthday had a small 6 next to the byline indicating there 
were six ninas in the text 
normally the name of hirschfelds daughter nina appears in 
his sketches with the number of times revealed next to the 
artists name 
nina was born on oct 20 1945 and on that day i put in a 
drawing in a circus poster in the background a little baby 
reading a book called nina the wonder child he said and 
since then it has become a national insanity 
on monday celebrities from the art and theater worlds turned 
out at the margo feiden galleries where much of hirschfelds work 
is displayed to honor the man who has captured many of their 
likenesses 
the artist known for his caricatures of celebrities as diverse 
as humphrey bogart superman and albert einstein estimates 
conservatively that he has sketched more than 3000 drawings 
in the times where many of his caricatures are published 
hirschfeld said his career began in the 1920s when a friend who 
happened to be a press agent saw a caricature he had sketched on a 
theater program 
that sketch was sold to the herald tribune which wanted another 
one the following week about a year later the times started 
requesting sketches and hirschfeld kept them coming 
hirschfeld said drawing feeds his insatiable appetite for pure 
line for distillation for bringing things down to the simplest 
form

job programs in four states boosted the 
longterm earnings of welfare recipients and saved some states 
money bolstering the case for welfare reform bills pending in 
congress according to a study released tuesday 
the study of programs in arkansas maine maryland and virginia 
yielded important new results that point to the longterm 
effectiveness of recent state welfare employment initiatives 
according to the manpower demonstration research corp which 
conducts independent research on social policy issues 
we have known for some time that these programs increase 
employment and earnings in the short term we now know that these 
results continue for at least three years said judith gueron 
president of the group 
as congress moves forward with welfare reform legislation 
this information gives us new confidence about the impact and 
costeffectiveness of a key part of this reform she said in a 
statement 
mdrc has been conducting largescale studies of welfare 
employment programs in eight states for six years its findings 
helped shape the house and senate welfare overhaul bills now 
awaiting reconciliation in a conference committee 
the pivotal element of both bills is a largescale education 
training and jobs program with a special focus on teenaged mothers 
and others likely to be on welfare for long periods 
gueron said the earnings gains found in the mdrc study though 
they continued for the full three years were relatively modest 
the programs themselves do not appear to move a large percentage 
of the welfare caseload out of poverty she said 
mdrc researchers evaluated low to moderatecost programs in 
arkansas virginia and maryland which required participation by 
women with children over three or six earnings gains in the final 
year of the study averaged 300 to 500 per person 
mdrc called the averages notable because they were based on all 
people eligible for the programs not just the 50 percent or so 
that actually participated 
researchers also studied training opportunities in the private 
sector one option in maines welfare employment program it 
involved voluntary participation by screened participants and 
offered lengthier more intensive services than those available in 
the other states broader programs 
mdrc said the program was much smallerscale and had atypical 
enrollees and resulted in increased earnings of 952 in the third 
year of followup 
the maine and maryland programs did not result in any welfare 
savings but average welfare payments to participants in arkansas 
in the third year were 18 percent less than payments to those in a 
control group in virginia the average payments were 8 percent 
less

a yale alumnus accused of setting afire 
shanties erected on the university campus as an antiapartheid 
protest entered an innocent plea today and requested a jury trial 
a lawyer for dr elwood bracey of west palm beach fla who 
didnt appear in court entered the plea in new haven superior 
court 
a date for a pretrial hearing on the charge of thirddegree 
arson was set for july 14 no one was injured in the incident 
antiapartheid activists meanwhile have declared unacceptable 
a proposal by the university administration under which a 
40footlong memorial wall could be reconstructed on campus on a 
limited basis if the coalition against apartheid agreed to 
voluntarily dismantle the structure and store it for at least the 
summer 
the wall covered with pictures and statements in support of the 
antiapartheid movement replaced the shanties destroyed in the 
fire june 5 
last week the yale administration announced that the wall could 
remain up only for four days through noon monday however when 
the deadline arrived the administration didnt try to take down 
the wall but instead proposed a compromise 
the coalition immediately rejected the proposal 
its still the university telling us what to do said 
charlotte hitchcock a yale graduate student 
the shanties and the wall were built by students and comunity 
members seeking to end all yale investment in companies doing 
business in south africa the coalition said it would not take the 
wall down until yale fully divests itself of such stocks 
yale secretary sheila w wellington said monday the burning of 
the shanties and threats of arson since june 5 have made officials 
conclude that the symbolic structures must be temporary not 
capable of being lived in and adequately protected 
in addition officials said the shanties and wall were erected 
on a granite plaza located over part of the beinecke rare book and 
manuscript library another fire might not only endanger human 
safety it could also pose a threat to some of the librarys rare 
documents they said 
university police have guarded continuously since it went up 
but officials said that isnt prudent use of police services

crops and livestock continue to suffer from 
drought in much of the nation but the effects vary widely the 
governments joint agricultural weather facility reported tuesday 
precipitation across the northern great plains did very little 
to ease the drought and improve crop condition during the week of 
june 1319 the facility said the lack of moisture combined 
with high temperatures stressed crops and slowed growth throughout 
most of the eastern half of the nation 
about 23 percent of the winter wheat acreage had been harvested 
by june 19 6 percentage points ahead of a year ago as near ideal 
weather pushed the harvest as far north as illinois the report 
said 
corn was good to fair in the central great plains and fair in 
most other major producing areas the report said corn silking 
was limited mostly to the southeast and delta georgias corn was 
more advanced with some acreage finishing the kernel dough stage 
and entering dent 
the report on the corn crop added the average stalk height 
exceeded the average in illinois extreme dry conditions stressed 
corn in ohio but earlier plantings fare better than late 
plantings the extreme heat rolled corn leaves in nebraska 
soybean plantings were 93 percent completed in the major 
production states by june 19 most planting during the week was in 
the corn belt and central great plains 
the lack of moisture hampered and in some cases halted 
planting in the delta and southeast the report said soybeans 
were mostly fair condition but available moisture kept condition 
good to fair in the central great plains soybeans suffered the 
most in the delta and appalachian states where condition was fair 
to poor 
livestock pastures showed no signs of resurgence in the 
eastern half of the nation and producers began culling herds as 
forage supplies declined the report said

parliaments three racially 
segregated chambers held their first fullscale joint debate 
tuesday discussing a bill that would expand blacks political role 
while keeping them out of parliament 
most prominent black leaders have rejected the bill which is 
aimed at negotiating a powersharing system in which the white 
minority would retain political and economic control 
the dominant white chamber of parliament has sat previously with 
the 4yearold asian and mixedrace chambers but only for 
ceremonial occasions and major speeches not to debate legislation 
the only previous joint debates have been in committees not among 
the full chambers 
on the agenda tuesday was a controversial proposal to establish 
a council that would negotiate a new constitutional system the 
government says the council also would provide a voice for blacks 
in national affairs during the period of negotiations 
the council with a minimum membership of 36 would include 
cabinet ministers provincial administrators eight presidential 
appointees leaders of six semiautonomous black homelands and 
nine blacks chosen on a regional basis by black municipal 
councilors 
the most prominent of the homeland leaders chief minister 
mangosuthu buthelezi has declared that he wont participate on 
the council until african national congress leader nelson mandela 
is released from prison 
more militant black leaders as well as many antiapartheid 
whites have rejected the bill outright saying it is an attempt by 
the government to evade demands for a oneman onevote democracy 
at present the 5 million whites hold political and economic power 
while the 26 million blacks have voting rights only in homeland and 
municipal elections 
constitutional development minister chris heunis speaking in 
parliament described the bill as a legislative landmark 
it is the first time in our history that legislation is being 
introduced with the goal of laying a foundation for the 
participation of all south africans and communities in the 
political and governing process he said 
those who want to perpetuate racism will certainly say the 
legislation is the last nail in the coffin of the whites heunis 
said adding that the bill would be mercilessly fought by 
revolutionary and violent forces on the left 
but he said south africans interested in peaceful solutions will 
view the bill as an attempt to give content to the high ideals of 
liberation and freedom 
the star south africas largest daily newspaper said in an 
editorial tuesday that no black leaders of consequence seem 
disposed to take part in the council 
the government will of course find black faces somewhere to 
sit on the council but they will not carry credibility it said 
the prognosis is not a happy one

an international agency has set up a task force to 
examine ways to relieve airport congestion and flight delays that 
have reached a crisis situation in europe a spokesman for the 
group said tuesday 
the task force held its first meeting may 25 in montreal where 
it mapped out a working plan to tackle problems created by an 
increase in aircraft takeoffs and landings especially in europe 
said international air transport association spokesman david kyd 
kyd said in an interview with the associated press that aircraft 
movements in europe had increased by 7 percent this year compared 
with 1987 and that last years level may double by the year 2002 
it is now a crisis situation everybodys waking up to it 
he said 
the sixmember committee will examine the traffic problem 
worldwide but is starting with europe where the problem is most 
acute kyd said 
one idea the task force was studying was the possibility of 
ending night curfews at airports in order to increase their 
capacity because new quiet jets can land almost with their 
engines shut down and therefore create less noise he said 
the task force also was looking at the entire air traffic 
control system and is likely to encourage governments to hire more 
air traffic controllers and raise their salaries kyd said 
the task force will meet again in september in london he said

soviet soldiers under attack by 
moslem guerrillas have evacuated kandahar afghanistans 
secondlargest city for the safety of its heavily fortified 
airport western diplomats said tuesday 
insurgents have had kandahar under siege for a month and say 
they have formed an arc around the city cutting roads on the 
north south and east 
those claims were supported by the reports from diplomats who 
said afghan troops were driven to the city limits and the red army 
which is leaving afghanistan under an agreement signed april 14 
moved its men to the airport 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said travel 
on the road to herat in western afghanistan was sporadic and many 
vehicles came under guerrilla fire 
food prices in kandahar have increased tenfold because of the 
siege they said the city is about 300 miles south of kabul the 
capital 
earlier reports have said pressure from ussupported 
insurgents had forced the soviets to delay withdrawal from 
kandahar an occasional battered military truck has been seen 
heading west from the city but there are no reports of significant 
soviet troop movement 
according to the diplomats soviet commanders are limiting use 
of their helicopters to avoid losing them to guerrillas armed with 
usmade stinger rockets and other antiaircraft weapons 
at least 2000 soviet soldiers are said to be at the airport 
which is southeast of the city and has been under guerrilla rocket 
fire 
when the withdrawal agreement was signed in geneva more than 
100000 soviet military personnel were helping afghanistans 
communist government fight the 10yearold insurgency the pullout 
began may 15 and is to be completed within nine months of that date 
while the siege of kandahar continues guerrilla leaders say 
they are attacking government garrisons and villages on the 
strategic highway from kandahar to kabul 
western diplomats support insurgent claims that they control 
kalat capital of zabul province 150 miles south of kabul the 
afghan government denies it 
reports say the afghan air force has pounded guerrilla positions 
in kalat since sunday and an estimated 300 afghan soldiers are 
holed up in a fort on the outskirts 
guerrillas delayed an attack on ghazni midway between kabul and 
kandahar because residents said they had nowhere to go and refused 
to leave their homes the diplomats said 
soviet soldiers withdrew from ghazni earlier this month the 
road from there to kabul is said to be closed 
diplomats indicated disbelief of some reports about soviet 
withdrwals 
although the afghan government says the red army has left 
jalalabad they said there are persistent reports of soviet 
soldiers in the city capital of eastern nangarhar province 
a soviet general said his soldiers had evacuated logar province 
in the east but the diplomats said reports reached kabul that 
troops were seen last week in pulialam the provincial capital 
and near mohammad agha 50 miles south of the capital 
reports from northern afghanistan said large napalm bombs were 
being moved south from hairatan on the afghan side of the oxus 
river and truckdrivers who saw them lodged a complaint with un 
monitors the sources reported 
weapons supplies from the soviet union are not forbidden by the 
geneva pact which was reached with un mediation a side 
agreement between the soviet union and united states guarantors of 
the accord allows each to supply its allies 
a western diplomat said afghanistan has denied use of the kabul 
airport to the un monitoring team which is empowered to 
investigate complaints by both pakistan and afghanistan the geneva 
agreement is between those two nations 
pakistan afghanistans eastern neighbor is involved because 
more than 3 million of the 55 million afghans who have fled their 
country live there in border camps and cities most of the others 
are in iran which borders afghanistan on the west

inflation slowed for the second month in a row 
to an annual rate of 42 percent in may the government said 
tuesday with the farm belt drought yet to reach the grocery 
shelves and consumers balking at paying more for clothing 
retail prices overall rose just 03 percent in may and food 
prices were up only 04 percent almost half their 07 percent 
increase in april the labor department said 
last months increase in the consumer price index the smallest 
since a 02 percent rise in february slowed the pace of inflation 
in may from a 53 percent annual rate in april and a 64 percent 
rate in march 
for the first five months of 1988 overall retail prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 44 percent the same pace as in 1987 
where is the inflation bear sandra shaber an analyst for 
the futures group a washington consulting firm said his 
footprints are not in much evidence right now 
however ms shaber like several other economists warned that 
an inflation problem hasnt gone away its just hibernating right 
now 
john hagens an economist for the wefa group of bala cynwyd 
pa said the severe dry weather across much the nation could start 
showing up in food prices as early as next month 
prior to the drought we were looking to food pices for the 
year rising about 35 percent he said now were looking in 
the range of 55 percent 
but noting that consumers only spend about onesixth of their 
income on food hagens predicted the higher grocery prices from the 
drought will add only half a percentage point to the overall 
inflation rate for the year 
higher prices for gasoline and medical costs were behind most of 
the inflation in may but they were somewhat offset by a leveling 
off in prices for clothing 
womens apparel prices which had skyrocketed more than 7 
percent in march and april actually fell by 04 percent last month 
theirs a lot of stiff consumer resistence out there said 
ms shaber retailers already have put the stuff on sale thats 
just the opposite of the inflation expectations of the 1960s and 
70s 
gasoline prices rose 17 percent in may atop a 11 percent 
increase in april but remained only 29 percent above what they 
were a year ago 
medical costs jumped 07 percent in may and are now 64 percent 
higher than they were a year ago making them the single biggest 
propellant of inflation over the past 12 months 
the may figures raised the consumer price index to 1175 
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during 
a 198284 base period would have cost 11750 last month a dime 
more than in april 
in a related report tuesday the labor department said 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
fell 03 percent in may the decrease follows an increase of 10 
percent in april and a drop of 06 percent in march 
the changes left americans inflationadjusted earnings 07 
percent below a year ago 
hagens said the respite from droughtrelated higher food prices 
could continue another month as farmers bring their cattle to 
market more quickly because they cant afford to feed them 
the resulting lower meat prices he said will offset higher 
prices for fruits and vegetables which rose 06 percent in may 
after a 14 percent increase in april 
price increases for meats poultry fish and eggs also slowed 
from a 14 percent increase in april to 08 percent last month the 
may increases for most other food and beverages were 05 percent or 
less 
the drought and major hikes in commodity prices that were 
seeing are scary but its just too soon for them to have reached 
the retail market ms shaber said 
donald ratajczak an economist who directs his own survey of 
wholesale and retail prices from georgia state university in 
atlanta said poultry was a key ingredient in higher meat prices 
last month 
the poultry producers may be responding to higher feed costs 
but they are the result more of large us soy meal sales to the 
soviet union last fall than the drought he said 
about the only place where the drought reached the retail level 
was in prices for vegetable oil and mayonnaise those prices rose 
08 percent in may after remaining flat in april but they account 
for a miniscule onefourth of 1 percent of the cpi 
meanwhile housing costs continued to rise at an annual rate of 
36 percent in may the same pace of increase over the past year 
prices for new cars rose 02 percent last month with the paring 
of many dealer incentives but are still on 2 percent above what 
they were a year ago

vice president george bush forced to 
pennypinch to stay under the federal campaign spending cap is 
operating on a far tighter budget than democrat michael dukakis in 
the weeks leading up to the party conventions 
bush was only 17 million away from the 23 million primary 
spending limit as of the beginning of this month while dukakis 
still had 36 million to go before hitting the ceiling according 
to reports their campaigns filed this week with the federal 
election commission 
bush had more cash on hand 3 million than dukakis who had 2 
million while the likely republican candidate cannot spend that 
much on campaign activity without exceeding the cap the law allows 
for additional spending on legal and accounting costs which are 
not included in the 23 million limit 
jesse jackson who has refused to officially concede the 
democratic race to dukakis despite the massachusetts governors 
numerical lock on the nomination has spent only 11 million 
against the ceiling 
he entered this month with 12 million in cash on hand a solid 
start toward a warchest to fund his convention activities jackson 
has a full convention team and is planning a significant operation 
involving the platform and rules as well as delegate activity 
jackson borrowed 15 million in may which brought his receipts 
for the month to more than either bush or dukakis his total was 
39 million including 15 million in federal matching funds and 
893970 in contributions jackson also paid back 13 million in 
loans during the month 
dukakis raised 35 million close to 1 million in matching 
funds and 23 million in contributions from individuals 
bushs fundraising has come to a virtual standstill because he 
cant spend much more even if he raised new money during may he 
took in only 45834 in contributions and received 289792 in 
federal matching funds 
matching funds are provided to presidential candidates who agree 
to abide by the spending limits the taxpayersupported fund also 
foots the entire general election cost providing 46 million each 
to the republican and democratic party nominees 
bush and dukakis each have collected enough delegate support to 
win their parties nominations at the summer conventions the 
democrats meet in atlanta july 1821 the republicans gather in 
new orleans aug 1518 
bush however must keep his operation alive with very little 
spending between now and the august convention 
he has scaled back his traveling and has switched his strategy 
to washingtonoriented events and utilization of free news coverage 
which he gets by making himself accessible to the national media 
bush spent heavily in laying the groundwork at the beginning of 
his campaign last year since the start of this year he has spent 
162 million compared to dukakis 177 million 
among the candidates who dropped out of the race the financial 
statements show that senate minority leader bob dole of kansas and 
television evangelist pat robertson each owe more than 1 million 
in campaign debts 
rep jack kemp rny has whittled his down to 111397 and 
former secretary of state alexander haig jr owed 352648 as of 
the end of may their reports show

portauprince haiti ap haitians ventured back into the 
streets today after a military coup catapulted lt gen henri 
namphy back to power after four months of civilian rule and ended 
hopes for democracy 
leslie manigat the civilian president ousted by namphy on 
monday today called the new government very fragile and blamed 
the coup on corruption in the military he spoke from exile in the 
dominican republic 
some telephone service was restored in portauprince after 
being cut monday the streets filled with cars and people in the 
morning after being nearly deserted the previous morning 
scattered gunfire was heard in the streets overnight and into 
the dawn but there were no signs of factional fighting soldiers 
have often fired their weapons into the air to frighten civilians 
from the street since the coup 
manigat told reporters in santo domingo that he learned of the 
coup as he sat at home watching television monday night manigat 
said he still didnt know what role col jeanclaude paul who had 
been his main military ally was playing 
paul was at namphys side monday when namphy announced his new 
government on national television 
namphy always acted on his own manigat said but he added 
that he always had faith in paul as a loyal military man 
it was paul whom namphy tried to fire last week as commander of 
the powerful 700man dessalines batallion manigat reversed 
namphys transfer of paul and of several other officers and fired 
namphy for insubordination 
after mondays takeover namphy reappointed paul commander of 
the battalion 
manigat said he has talked to foreign governments and 
international organizations asking them to reject the namphy 
government he said he hasnt decided where his place of exile will 
be he said he would travel this month to europe for meetings with 
political leaders to rally support against the new government 
manigat said he wasnt told where he was being sent until he 
landed in the dominican republic which shares the island of 
hispaniola with haiti 
namphy reestablished military rule by decree and named his own 
government just hours after rallying troops who seized the national 
palace and quickly ousted manigats 4monthold civilian government 
on monday some citizens and officials predicted a bleak future 
for the western hemispheres poorest country 
most businesses and schools in this capital of 1 million people 
were closed there were no reported protests in this arid 
mountainous country of 6 million people 
this means the end of democracy we are going to have to live 
under a military dictatorship a bus driver said hours after 
namphy expelled manigat 
the army has taken power this is a government of murderers 
and machetes said a former haitian diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the coup dashed hopes for democracy promised by namphy after 
popular unrest toppled the duvalier familys 29year dictatorship 
the general had led the threeman junta that ruled haiti after 
jeanclaude duvalier fled exile in 1986 the junta stepped aside 
after manigat was elected jan 17 in fraudriddled balloting run by 
the military and boycotted by most haitians 
after the rift last week over namphys transfer of military 
officers manigat placed namphy under house arrest 
but loyal soldiers freed namphy on sunday and after brief gun 
and grenade battles haitis 7000man army united solidly behind 
the 55yearold career soldier it was not known if there were 
casualties in the fighting 
neither the haitian public nor democraticminded politicians 
publicly expressed support for manigats government 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the united states government strongly condemns this serious blow 
to hopes for democracy in that troubled land 
she noted that paul was indicted on federal drugtrafficking 
charges in miami last march 
namphy announced on national television that he had formed a 
military government named himself president appointed a 12member 
cabinet that included only one civilian and dissolved the national 
assembly 
he said he would rule by decree 
he told haitians that manigat betrayed your confidence and 
violated the constitution he swore to uphold 
the future of democracy was at stake the general said as 
the commanders of every unit in haitis armed forces watched the 
army must protect the superior interests of the country and must 
head the country to this end a military government has been 
formed

tapped 
there is no member of congress to my knowledge who is a 
target of this investigation and im a member of congress

the kind of activities alleged he should be brought swiftly to 
justice

regular contact with defense officials and contractors lots of 
people in the contracting business come through our offices he 
said

contributions from defense contractors adding i hope they will

the house banking committee approved 
legislation tuesday authorizing 427 million to renew and expand a 
program of aid to the homeless which was approved by congress last 
year 
the voicevote approval came after the democratcontrolled 
committee rejected along party lines 3019 a proposal by reps 
marge roukema rnj and thomas j ridge rpa which would have 
channeled homeless aid from a categorical grant program to block 
grants 
mrs roukema argued to no avail that the block grant approach 
would give states and cities more leeway in putting the money to 
use 
the panel did approve however an amendment by rep joseph j 
dioguardi rny which would require recipients of homelessaid 
grants to make a good faith effort to ensure that the housing 
facilities they provide are free of illegal drug use and alcohol 
abuse 
when the housing subcommittee took up the bill on june 3 
dioguardi introduced an amendment which would have required the 
recipients to certify that the facility was drugfree he withdrew 
the proposal after democrats criticized it but said he would work 
on new language

the state wont schedule executions until 
the state supreme court rules on an issue that could invalidate 
pennsylvanias death penalty law officials said tuesday 
it is clear to us that that issue will have to be resolved 
before there is an execution in pennsylvania said christopher a 
lewis the casey administrations executive deputy general counsel 
at issue is whether the death penalty statute provides a method 
for executions lawyers for roderick frey of lancaster who was 
scheduled to die in the electric chair june 14 argued that no 
method is called for so the law is unconstitutional 
the court in blocking freys execution agreed to hear 
arguments in september 
frey convicted of arranging the 1979 contract killing of his 
wife barbara jean was the subject of gov robert p caseys first 
execution warrant a ruling in freys favor could overturn his 
death sentence as well as those of 83 other death row prisoners 
its a broadbased challenge it reaches everybody on death 
row in pennsylvania said barry steinhardt executive director of 
the american civil liberties unions pennsylvania chapter the 
aclus lawyers help represent frey 
the electric chair at the state correctional institution at 
rockview has not been used since 1962 
a 1913 law established the states method of execution it also 
provided that if any section of the law was deemed 
unconstitutional the entire act would be void 
the us supreme court later ruled the death penalty 
unconstitutional because many states had what amounted to a 
mandatory death sentence for firstdegree murder the court allowed 
states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976 
a new state law was enacted in 1978 but instead of restating 
the method of execution it relied on the 1913 law

responsiblity for the progress of the world economy and to resolve 
how that responsibility should have practical manifestation in the 
years ahead

meetings has benefitted both our own countries and the wider world 
community the leaders said we believe too that the 
opportunities afforded by our meetings are becoming even more 
valuable in todays world of increasing interdependence and

from the united states britain japan west germany and italy to 
the renaissance chateau of rambouillet southwest of paris for some 
informal talks out of the glare of the spotlights 
in succeeding years the canadian prime minister and the 
president of the european economic community were added to the 
annual talks the discussions have become more tightly structured 
with officials working months in advance on the final communique 
and have attracted everincreasing platoons of journalists some 
3000 of them in toronto 
next years meeting will be the third in france and the second 
with mitterrand as host in 1982 his second year in office he 
staged the summit in the chateau of versailles with its atmosphere 
of glittering elegance from the days when louis xiv reigned there 
three centuries ago 
bicentennial preparations have been under way for years and 
have been a preoccupation of mitterrands since his 1981 election 
his reelection last month to a second sevenyear term gives him a 
chance to preside over the celebrations 
in his first term mitterrand launched such projects as a new 
opera house renovation of the louvre museum and construction of a 
huge arch in the form of a cube at the western gates of paris all 
to be completed in time for the anniversary of the july 14 1789 
seizing of the bastille prison which launched the revolution 
the approach of the bicentennial has sparked a debate in france 
over who is the true heir of the revolutions spirit the 
conservatives with their devotion to individual liberties or the 
leftists like mitterrand with their challenge to entrenched 
privilege and to the rich 
adding the summit to the menu of concerts historical 
reproductions and giant fireworks displays will give the french a 
chance to speculate about what such revolutionaries as danton and 
robespierre might have thought about the gathering of the worlds 
richest nations 
while both previous french summits have been held in chateau 
settings reminiscent of the nations renaissance grandeur a likely 
candidate for next years meeting is the shiny new 
commercialresidential complex of la defense at the western edge of 
the capital a symbol of a new france of high technology and rapid 
modernization 
two miles west of the arc de triomphe la defense is the 20th 
century prolongation to the famed eastwest axis in paris leading 
from the louvre through the place de la concorde and along the 
champselysee 
a showcase of architectural fantasies the complex houses more 
than 300 companies where some 60000 people work nearly 40000 
live in the residential secion 
spread over nearly 2470 acres on a bluff la defense is crowned 
by a gigantic ultramodern cubeshaped arch now under construction 
which will be an office building the design by danish architect 
otto van sprecklsen was chosen personally by mitterrand 
la defense takes its name from a monument on the site 
commemorating the defense of paris in 1871 when the french held off 
the germans in the francoprussian war 
the complex is a fiveminute ride from central paris on the rer 
a network of suburban express trains linked to the paris metro

drought aid is needed urgently in the nations 
breadbasket which has been transformed into a brown and brittle 
land as a result of 18 billion in crop damage a senate 
chairman said tuesday 
this drought comes at a time when many farmers are just 
climbing out of the hole after five years of farm depression 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt said 
but now with their crops burned and their livestock hungry they 
are once again threatened with bankruptcy 
leahy said that a weekend inspection tour by six senators into 
montana and the dakotas found a brown and brittle land 
these three states along with minnesota are suffering 
through the worst drought this early in the season that has 
occurred in my lifetime leahy said estimated crop losses in 
these states alone are running in excess of 18 billion and 
thats a conservative estimate that goes higher every day 
he said a drought task force meeting wednesday should stay in 
session until consensus has bee reached on what kind of aid package 
to recommend 
the bipartisan task force of lawmakers and administration 
officials was formed last week to monitor crop damage arising from 
the broiling sun and shortage of rainfall that has wrung out the 
farm belt over the last month 
any hope of winning approval of drought relief depends on 
keeping the issue bipartisan and avoiding friction with the 
administration leahy said he praised agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng for opening conservation lands to hay cutting and 
cattle grazing but leahy said more aid would be needed 
lyng told lawmakers last week to be prepared to move with 
drought relief legislation but urged them not to make anything 
final until the seriousness of the problem was fully known leahy 
said however that it was not too soon to get started with a bill 
youve got to be giving some help to these people to say hang 
on leahy told reporters at what point do they sit around the 
kitchen table and start to say i cant take it anymore i dont 
want that to happen 
he said many afflicted farmers have just come through five 
years of living hell 
what i saw was not a disaster in the making leahy said 
what i saw was a disaster now 
even if the task force reaches a consensus this week on the 
shape of an aid package it most likely would take weeks or longer 
to get the bill to president reagans desk 
in response to a question he scoffed at the notion that 
congressional enthusiasm for the issue may be sparked largely by 
electionyear pressures 
the senate appropriations committee balked on monday at a 
proposal to guarantee 92 percent of federal incomesupport payments 
to wheat feed grains upland cotton and rice producers whose crops 
are wiped out by the drought 
sen quentin burdick dnd proposed the measure saying the 
situation in his state already was grim but other panel members 
said it still was too early to act and that his proposal would have 
provided no aid to producers of crops not covered by usda programs 
in the end the panel did not vote on the proposal and instead 
voted to attach a sense of congress resolution calling for 
drought aid in a 473 billion agriculture appropriation bill for 
the fiscal year starting oct 1

a former pentagon investigator said tuesday 
the justice department had substantive evidence that there was 
massive fraud in military weapons purchases three years ago but 
failed to pursue the case 
we had extensive evidence that other companies were involved 
beyond the few that were charged robert l segal said at a capitol 
hill news conference 
segals scheduled testimony to a senate subcommittee on oct 1 
1985 was blocked by the justice department because it allegedly 
would have harmed ongoing criminal cases 
sen charles grassley riowa the subcommittee chairman at the 
time has contended this week that the current pentagon bribery 
probe could have been conducted three years ago 
attorney general edwin meese iii at a news conference monday 
defended the justice department against grassleys charges i can 
assure you that at no time has this department had to be dragged 
into any indictment where the evidence is there meese said 
segal said that before resigning from the government in january 
1985 he had worked 11 years for the drug enforcement administration 
for 11 years and for one year for the defense department where he 
served as the pentagons liaison with the procurement fraud unit in 
the justice department 
segal now a stockbroker in suburban springfield va said his 
decision to leave government work has nothing to do with this 
case 
he described as himself as frustrated because he said there was 
a terrible lack of competence at the fraud unit they 
literally were not prepared to handle an involved case he said 
asked to estimate the extent of bribery and fraud in pentagon 
procurement segal answered i think its common 
he made clear that he doesnt believe that the investigations 
were blocked for political reasons a view shared by grassley 
what happened has nothing to do with the administration 
said segal its not the administration were talking about here 
its the bureaucracy 
grassley said its the bureaucracy thats at fault its not 
the administration this has been a problem of both democratic and 
republican administrations 
segal said he suggested in 1985 that defense officials and 
consultants who passed classified documents should be charged with 
espionage while he said the charge could later be lowered 
espionage is a leverage item in trying to pleabargain with 
people in an investigation 
segal said he saw cases involving the alleged unauthorized 
taking of hundreds of pages of classified documents but said no 
one seemed concerned about the fact that classified information was 
being sold being bandied about 
in a related development tuesday sen david pryor dark said 
the congressional general accounting office estimates that while 
the pentagon says it spent 155 million on consultants in fiscal 
1987 the actual cost was 28 billion 
and that figure high as it is may be far too low pryor said 
he said the gao estimated that consulting costs might run as high 
as 18 billion a year 
pryor said the pentagon has been using a very narrow 
definition obviously of how to define a consultants contract

half of americas 43 million schoolage 
children have never experienced tooth decay a dental problem that 
affected almost all of americas youth just a generation ago 
according to a federal study released tuesday 
in a study that included the oral examination of about 40000 
youngsters coasttocoast the national institute of dental 
research found that dental cavities have declined by 36 percent 
among children ages 5 to 17 and that 499 percent of these 
children had no tooth decay at all 
officials said the sample population examined was selected to 
represent the approximately 43 million schoolaged children in the 
nation 
dr james p carlos chief of the epidemiology at the nidr said 
that dental decay a problem that has plagued humankind throughout 
history has been steadily declining since the use of fluoride 
became widespread and that the trend probably will continue 
this disease which is probably the most chronic disease of 
childhood is being decreased very fast said carlos it is 
declining 35 to 36 percent every seven years and now half of the 
children in the country have never even experienced dental decay 
carlos said the decline in tooth decay follows a pattern 
consistent with the increased use of fluoride in the nations 
drinking water in toothpastes and in mouth washes 
he said the increased use of a dental sealant also has affected 
the decline in tooth decay the sealant is a plastic material that 
dentists paint on the chewing surfaces to protect teeth from decay 
for the survey specialists counted the amount of decay or 
fillings noted on each of the 128 surfaces of a typical set of 28 
teeth in the school children a missing tooth was counted as five 
surfaces wisdom teeth were not counted since few school children 
have them 
the result showed that the statistical mean of tooth surfaces 
with decay was 307 per child the mean in a survey taken in 1980 
was 477 reflecting a 36 percent decline in tooth cavities 
in 1980 the survey found that 366 percent of the children were 
free of tooth decay this compares to almost half 499 percent 
found without decay in the recent survey 
carlos said no similar surveys were taken prior to the 1980 
finding but experts estimate that the only 28 percent of the 
school children in the 1970s were without tooth decay and that a 
generation earlier virtually every child experienced some tooth 
decay between age 5 and 17 
he said in the 1940s it was estimated that us school children 
averaged seven teeth each that were decayed missing or filled 
now instead of counting teeth he said the survey must count 
surfaces affected in order to get a meaningful statistic 
carlos said school children in the southwest which includes 
texas new mexico arizona and colorado showed the least amount of 
tooth decay with a mean of 24 tooth surfaces affected per child 
that region showed a mean of 34 in 1980 
the new england states maine new hampshire vermont 
massachusetts connecticut and rhode island showed the highest 
rate with an mean of 36 compared to a mean of 61 in 1980 
other regional findings with the mean number of tooth surfaces 
per child affected and the same mean from the 1980 survey in 
parenthesis are 
northeast new york pennsylania new jersey 34 54 
midwest minnesota wisconsin michigan iowa missouri 
illionis indiana ohio 29 47 
southeast maryland virginia delaware north carolina south 
carolina georgia florida alabama mississippi tennessee 
kentucky west virginia arkansas louisiana 31 46 
pacific alaska hawaii washington oregon and california 34 
51 
northwest north dakota south dakota nebraska kansas 
oklahoma montana idaho wyoming nevada and utah 28 44 
carlos said the reason for the regional difference has never 
been satisfactorily explained and is one of the enduring mysteries 
of dental epidemiology 
at one time he said experts thought that the varying amounts of 
fluoride in the drinking water of the national regions accounted 
for the differences but that has now been discounted because 
fluoride is presence in about 60 percent of the water systems in 
the nation 
dr preston a littleton jr deputy director of nidr said the 
decline in childhood dental decay will make it possible for the 
agency to concentrate more of its research efforts toward dental 
problems experienced among adults and older americans 
the results give us the opportunity to redeploy efforts and 
attempt to make similar gains among the older population said 
littleton

both were governors of mediumsized states 
both sprang to national prominence still strangers to many voters 
both were washington outsiders both lacked foreign policy 
experience 
the similarities generally end there between michael dukakis 
the democratic presidential nomineetobe and jimmy carter the 
last democratic president who was voted out of office 
but republican george bush who will face dukakis in the fall as 
the republican nominee would love to make the comparison stick in 
the minds of voters dukakis as an unsmiling jimmy carter 
whether the similarities run beyond the superficial and whether 
they reveal anything about what kind of president dukakis would be 
is open to question 
he has similar gaps that i had he had never served in 
washington and so forth carter said this week as he worked on a 
philadelphia housing project for lowincome residents 
but the former president took offense at bushs campaign tactics 
hes run kind of a silly campaign so far making personal 
attacks on dukakis already and trying to compare dukakis with me 
and things of that kind which i think is counterproductive fowe will not 
abandon the land because murderers want it 
shamir said at givat ada a communal farm in northern israel where 
eli cohen was buried 
in nablus the west banks largest city a 10yearold boy was 
shot by an israeli civilian who opened fire to disperse a 
stonethrowing mob said officials at the citys al ittihad 
hospital 
the civilian was injured when his car was stoned but other 
details were not available said an army spokesman 
in the nearby village of burka soldiers opened fire against 
youths who set up roadblocks then threw stones at troops the 
spokesman said he added that one youth was wounded 
the 10yearold was shot in the right leg and the victim in 
burka was a 16yearold with a bullet wound in the left shoulder 
hospital officials said neither was seriously hurt 
in the shati refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip soldiers 
opened fire to disperse demonstrators wounding a 25yearold arab 
in the chest said doctors at gaza citys ahli arab hospital the 
army said it had no report of the incident 
israel radio said thousands of israelis gathered for the funeral 
of cohen the farmer whose stabbed and battered body was found 
monday amid his grape vines in moshav shekef a communal farm near 
the west bank 
shamir whose remarks were carried by the radio and the israeli 
itim news agency called on the mourners to build a fortified 
strengthened israel 
if the killers their dispatchers their commanders mean to 
tell us it is either us or them then our answer is clear this is 
our land of israel shamir said 
if its our fate to fight for our lives we will be here and 
not them he said we will harden our will not to surrender 
several mourners shouted death to the terrorists 
cohens coffin was draped in an israeli flag he was buried in 
givat ada a farming village in northern israel where he once 
lived moshav shekef where he died is 25 miles south of jerusalem 
cohen 33 was the fourth israeli killed since the arab uprising 
began last december at least 210 palestinians have been killed 
the slaying of cohen who left a pregnant wife and two children 
has raised calls for tougher action to quell the revolt against 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
raphael eitan a rightwing member of parliament and former army 
chief of staff was quoted by itim as saying only mass deportations 
could halt the intefadeh 
we should expel immediately 50 heads of families to lebanon 
wherever there is a disturbance and it doesnt matter who was 
involved in the disturbance eitan said if its an uprising of 
the people it must be dealt with collectively 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said in an interview with the 
associated press that cohens death proved the correctness of the 
government policy of encouraging civilians to carry arms and to 
fire in self defense 
i am really sorry the farmer who was attacked and viciously 
killed did not have the weapon that we would have hoped he would 
rabin said i believe the whole results would be entirely 
different he would be alive today 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post said cohens murder marks 
a significant escalation in the intefadeh because the slaying was 
inside israel not in the territories captured from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the intefadeh is moving slowly but steadily into israel the 
daily said 
in the gaza strip meanwhile israeli soldiers were seen sealing 
palestinian shops in downtown gaza city where two soldiers were 
injured by a firebomb monday night 
an arab witness said by telephone that troops welded shut the 
doors of five shops then took the equipment to the next street he 
said he could not see if the troops were closing other shops 
because he could not leave his house under curfew orders 
a military spokesman said he was unaware of the sealing of 
shops but confirmed a curfew was in effect in downtown gaza city

a union carbide corp representative 
said tuesday that the company would negotiate with private lawyers 
for victims of the 1984 bhopal gas disaster 
we will settle with individuals they all have their own 
lawyers said the representative an american lawyer who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
about 523000 people have filed claims in the bhopal district 
court in the worlds worst industrial disaster 
nearly 3000 people died and 20000 were seriously injured when 
methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a union carbide subsidiarys 
plant in bhopal in december 1984 
india filed a 3 billion compensation suit against the danbury 
connbased multinational but the case still is at pretrial stage 
the indian government also passed a law making it the sole legal 
representative of the victims 
when asked if the settlement with the victims would be legal in 
view of the law the union carbide representative said the case 
can be settled in the united states there is no law to prevent 
that 
but hk khan secretary of indias chemicals and petrochemicals 
ministry said union carbide could not settle directly with the 
victims in the united states 
he said the company submitted itself to indian law and is 
bound by the law 
the government last week requested the bhopal court to issue an 
injunction blocking union carbide from such a move 
judge mw deo is to rule on the application july 29 
the union carbide representative said it was waiting for the 
indian government to provide the company with the exact number of 
real victims 
khan said the government lawyers will provide the list of real 
victims to the court the court begins hearing individual cases 
we are under no obligation to provide the list to union 
carbide he said 
khan said the indian government had to go back to court 
because there was no proper offer forthcoming from carbide for an 
outofcourt settlement he refused to discuss figures 
sources close to union carbide said in november 1987 that the 
company was willing to pay 650 million in an outofcourt 
settlement but the indian government was pressing for more

nagornokarabakhs legislature on tuesday asked 
that the southern territory be made independent until moscow 
decides whether it belongs to soviet armenia or azerbaijan reports 
from the area said 
most of 160000 people in nagornokarabakh are ethnic armenians 
a mainly christian ethnic group but it was assigned in 1923 to the 
predominantly moslem neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
the legislature voted feb 20 to request annexation to armenia 
and the armenian legislature supported it but azerbaijan has 
refused to give up the territory and moscow has not said whether it 
will decide the question 
on tuesday the nagornokarabakh legislators appealed to the 
federal supreme soviet for temporary independence according to 
koryun nahabidyan an armenian activist in moscow who spoke to 
nagornokarabakh residents familiar with the decision 
nahabidyan who has led several armenian demonstrations in 
moscow said the legislature asked for independence until the 
supreme soviet the national parliament decided whether 
nagornokarabakh would remain part of azerbaijan or be given to 
armenia 
a resident of stepanakert the territorial capital said the 
whole city of 60000 people gathered outside government 
buildings to await the legislatures decision the resident 
speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity said the members 
rejected a proposal to secede from azerbaijan 
he said the legislature appealed to residents who have been 
striking since may 23 to return to their jobs then added without

unclear some of the deputies said things people wont like 
reports have said the strike has stopped nearly all commercial 
activity in the region except for retailing and agriculture 
the activist in moscow nahabidyan said the territorial 
legislature asked the supreme soviet to disregard fridays decision

yasser arafats guerrillas and 
syrianbacked palestinian rivals battled in beiruts chatilla and 
bourj elbarajneh refugee camps tuesday in a bloody power struggle 
police said 12 people were killed and 45 wounded 
the casualties raised the toll since fighting began 12 days ago 
to 46 killed and 188 wounded 
police said machine gun fire forced the closing of the road next 
to bourj elbarajneh which leads to the beirut airport flight 
operations were not affected police said 
shell blasts echoed across beirut as arafats fatah fighters 
the main component of the palestine liberation organization and 
col saeed mousas fatahuprising guerrillas pounded each others 
positions with mortar and rocket barrages 
a fatah spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
mousas fighters deployed outside the camps launched two assaults 
on chatilla and bourj elbarajneh around noon he said both attacks 
were repulsed by arafat supporters 
police said mousas gunners deployed in syriancontrolled 
territory in mountains overlooking beirut hammered both camps with 
155mm howitzers 
mousas fighters also battered the shantytowns with 82mm and 
120mm mortars from positions in syriancontrolled neighborhoods 
around the camps 
fatah guerrillas responded with 120mm mortar fire police said 
fatahuprising said it foiled an attempt by arafats men to 
storm one of their outposts on the outskirts of bourj elbarajneh 
in the afternoon 
police said two mortar rounds exploded in residential 
neighborhoods around chatilla killing four civilians and wounding 
18 
they said one 155mm artillery shell crashed into a densely 
populated district near bourj elbarajneh wounding three people 
fatah accused mousas gunners of shelling the camps 
indiscriminately after their repeated failure to achieve any 
military victory on the ground 
the camps have been the scene of some of the worst violence in 
beirut since 1982 when christian militiamen massacred hundreds of 
people in chatilla and nearby sabra 
the camps shelled and besieged by israels invading army that 
year were later battered by syrianbacked shiite moslems for more 
than two years thousands of people were killed or wounded in those 
battles 
now palestinian is fighting palestinian 
tuesdays fighting raged despite efforts by libyan mediators and 
other palestinian factions to arrange a ceasefire 
arafats loyalists had dislodged mousas guerrillas from the two 
camps in earlier fighting 
but the latter regrouped in syrianpoliced areas of west beirut 
and the citys southern slums and have launched a series of 
abortive attacks to regain territory they lost in the shantytowns 
mousa broke away from the plo in 1983 with other syrianbacked 
radical factions in a dipsute over arafats policies they set up 
their headquarters in damascus syrias capital 
fatah and mousas group have been fighting in the camps despite 
a reconciliation between arafat and syrian president hafez assad in 
damascus in april that was aimed at ending their 5yearold feud 
over who would control the palestinian movement

washington the nations savings and loan industry continued to 
bleed huge amounts of red ink in the first three months of this 
year as the deterioration of the worst sampls overwhelmed a modest 
improvement at solvent institutions the government said tuesday 
the federal home loan bank board said the 3118 federally 
insured sampls lost 378 billion only slightly below the 381 
billion record set in the last three months of 1987 
bank board economist james barth said the losses continued to 
pile up despite some hopeful signs 
earnings at thrifts considered solvent under regulatory rules 
totaled 600 million compared with a 200 million loss in the 
fourth quarter of 1987 
also the percentage of solvent institutions increased from 65 
percent to 69 percent and the number of insolvent sampls under 
generally accepted accounting rules fell for the first time in two 
years from 518 to 504 
unfortunately we do have a bifurcated industry barth said 
the insolvents got worse although solvents did indeed realize 
gains 
in the januarymarch period 2164 institutions earned 13 
billion but 954 lost 51 billion the 20 worst sampls accounted for 
3 billion of the losses and the worst 50 accounted for 37 
billion 
texas where 133 of 279 sampls are considered insolvent racked up 
losses of 348 billion institutions in texas along with the 
other oildrilling states of louisiana and oklahoma have been 
particularly hardpressed by the plunge in oil and regional real 
estate prices 
last year the thrift industry had its worst year since the 
great depression losing 76 billion that figure released 
tuesday is an upward revision from previous estimates of 68 
billion 
martin a regalia chief economist of the national council of 
savings institutions said 1988 losses will likely top 8 billion 
and set another record 
however he said there are a lot of things in these numbers 
to suggest that while the problem is terrible it is not getting 
worse it is bottoming out somewhat i dont mean to put a 
favorable light on a 38 billion loss but there are some glimmers 
out there 
by comparison the nations 13541 commercial banks earned 36 
billion in 1987 the smallest profit since the depression and 50 
billion in the first quarter of 1988 
while banks performance is improving sampls have not gotten 
better yet despite regulators efforts to shut down or bail out 
sick sampls twelve were closed or merged with healthier institutions 
from january through march 
the bank board said earlier this month that the industrys 
capital which closely mirrors losses declined about another 550 
million in april 
however barth said preliminary data from april indicates the 
industry as a whole could turn an operating profit in the second 
quarter 
the question is how many more bad loans are out there but 
unrecognized on sampls books loan losses accounted for 39 billion 
of the first quarter loss versus 40 billion the previous quarter 
hopefully most of the writedowns have been accounted for 
and that would indicate losses will taper off barth said 
but some private analysts say there are likely billions more in 
losses yet to be booked and they say rising interest rates could 
cut into the operating profits of healthy thrifts 
the reason losses continue to mount is they already exist 
its just a matter of recognizing them said richard l peterson 
professor of finance at texas tech university in lubbock 
a lot of people would say that losses in the industry total 
55 billion were still a long way from recognizing that plus 
there is some risk of shortterm interest rates going up and losses 
increasing he said 
the scope of the industrys losses is becoming increasingly 
critical as regulators and congress try to determine how long the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp which insures savings 
deposits of 100000 or less can continue operating without an 
infusion of more money 
bank board chairman m danny wall said the 20 billion the fslic 
will have over the next three years is as much as the agency can 
reasonably spend and it is too soon to tell if more will be needed 
later 
however the general accounting office congress auditing 
agency estimates it will cost 26 billion to 36 billion to 
resolve the cases of the more than 500 insolvent institutions 
private analysts put the price tag at 50 billion or more

the military said tuesday it captured 
a communist rebel leader 40 other guerrillas and a major base on 
the main island of luzon 
gen renato de villa the army chief of staff presented the 
captured guerrilla leader at a news conference and identified him 
as francisco pascual 41 a member of the central committee of the 
communist party of the philippines de villa refused to identify 
the others or say where they were being held 
he told reporters that pascual and 40 other rebels were arrested 
in raids monday night in the northern province of pangasinan about 
110 miles northwest of manila 
with the arrest of mr francisco pascual the rebel 
leadership as well as the entire organization is dealt another 
crippling blow by the government de villa said 
he said pascual was in charge of party activities in the central 
luzon region north of manila and was among rebel and government 
officials who supervised a twomonth ceasefire that ended in 
february 1987 
peace talks between the rebels and the government of president 
corazon aquino broke down in january 1987 and fighting resumed 
immediately after the truce expired a few weeks later 
brig gen orlando antonio a regional commander who also 
attended the news conference said troops confiscated more than 
2000 sticks of dynamite in a separate sweep in baguio city a 
mountain resort north of pangasinan 
antonio said pascual was arrested while on his way to a rebel 
hideout in dagupan in pangasinan 
at the base soldiers seized assorted documents a computer and 
radio equipment powerful enough to transmit messages to much of 
central and northern luzon antonio said 
what we captured in dagupan was actually an underground house 
of the military staff said pangasinan provincial commander col 
romeo odi in other words they were orchestrating their 
operations from that particular communications center and so 
with that capture we are able to paralyze their operations 
officials said the rebels planned to use the explosives to blow 
up bridges and other targets in luzons cagayan valley a rebel 
stronghold 
pascuals arrest brings to at least five the number of central 
committee members captured by the military this year among those 
were party general secretary rafael baylosis and romulo kintanar 
chief of the communist new peoples army

the worlds seven richest nations pledged tuesday 
to foster growth in the newly industrialized economies of asia and 
encouraged them to boost the value of their currencies and lessen 
their reliance on manufactured exports 
the communique issued at the end of the economic summit here 
said the newly industrializing economies of asia an umbrella 
term for hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan have become 
increasingly important in world trade 
these economies the communique saidare all characterized by 
dynamic exportled growth which has allowed them to treble their 
share of world trade since 1960 
other outwardoriented asian countries are also beginning to 
emerge as rapidly growing exporters of manufactures the leaders 
of the seven industrialized nations said in their statement 
with increasing economic importance come greater international 
responsibilities and a strong mutual interest in improved 
constructive dialogue and cooperative efforts between the 
industrialized countries and the emerging economies the 
communique said 
it said the efforts could focus on such matters as currency 
trade the stucture of the economies and broad policies such as 
interest rates and governmental budgets that affect economies 
the newly industrialized economies have been under strong 
pressure mainly from the united states to increase the value of 
their currencies and to offset their heavy reliance on the export 
of manufactured goods by increasing their domestic consumption 
japans minister of international trade and industry hajime 
tamura came to the defense of the developing countries in a speech 
here monday saying that they are being criticized as a threat to 
the rest of the world just because their trade surpluses have been 
swelling at an astonishing speed 
we should not nip the growth of burgeoning nations such as 
these in the bud tamura speaking through an interpreter told a 
joint meeting of the empire and canadian clubs 
later a senior japanese official at the summit told reporters 
that the foreign ministers of the seven nations had reached a 
consensus that there is a strong need to establish a dialogue 
with these countries 
tamura said japan has made a concerted effort to restructure its 
economy so as to increase manufactured imports and the newly 
industrializing economies will need to do the same thing 
the communique said that the aim of such restructuring should be 
to achieve the international adjustment necessary for sustained 
balanced growth of the world economy 
we encourage the development of informal processes which would 
facilitate multilateral discussions of issues of mutual concern and 
foster the necessary cooperation the communique said 
on the issue of trade the communique said that the reduction of 
large external trade balances on the part of some countries which 
imbalance the world economy will require not only the efforts of 
the industrialized countries but those of the newly industrializing 
nations which have such surpluses

two south african commandos were 
arrested after south african soldiers fired at a botswana police 
patrol and injured three officers the government said tuesday 
botswana accused south africa of state terrorism and said 
the commandos were planning a raid on a target in gaborone the 
capital 
south africas military headquarters confirmed an army patrol 
had fired on botswana policemen monday night while on an 
intelligence mission across the border 
the botswana statement said the shooting occurred when commandos 
surprised the police patrol along a railway line about four miles 
south of gaborone 
botswana said the police patrol was unarmed south africa said 
botswana police fired first but the soldiers returned the shots 
and then returned to their base in south africa 
the south african statement said the two whites arrested at the 
roadblock were not part of the unit involved in the shootout the 
army declined further comment about the arrested men unless the 
botswana government provides more details 
south african commandos have crossed the border of neighboring 
countries numerous times to raid suspected hideouts and bases of 
the african national congress the anc is the main guerrilla 
movement fighting south africas government 
this action was not aimed at the government or the people of 
botswana the south african statement said the accusation that 
south africa made itself guilty of state terrorism is preposterous 
especially coming from a country which allows terrorists to operate 
from its territory against south africa 
the office of president quett masire said the commandos were 
preparing to mount a raid in gaborone 
five commandos escaped but police said two south african 
commandos were arrested at an army roadblock and were being 
questioned police identified hem as corp johannes basson 25 and 
theodore hermanhen a police or army reservist both of 
johannesburg no age was given for hermanhen 
earlier in june after a series of bombings in johannesburg and 
pretoria south african law and order minister adriaan vlok warned 
the anc of retaliation 
the announcement of the arrests came hours after gaborone police 
reported a carbomb had exploded at dawn tuesday near the home of a 
building contractor in the capital 
the presidential statement said the bombing was yet another 
south african attempt on the lives of innocent batswana no one 
was injured in the bombing 
botswana officials say they do not condone the presence of anc 
guerrillas although the government is sympathetic to the ancs 
aims the anc seeks to end the apartheid system of racial 
separation to install a oneman onevote political system and to 
establish government controls over major economic sectors 
south african commandos have conducted several raids in gaborone 
against suspected anc guerrillas allegedly using the city as a 
staging post for sabotage attacks in south africa 
south african soldiers killed a man and three women in march 
when they raided a house on gaborones outskirts one person was 
killed in a similar attack in may 1986 and 15 were killed in a 
june 1985 raid

in scenes reminiscent of the dust bowl the 
unchecked prairie wind scratches precious topsoil from fields baked 
dry and left unprotected by a relentless drought then drifts the 
dirt into ditches like snow 
an estimated 35 million acres of north dakota cropland have 
each lost at least five tons of topsoil to wind erosion a 
fourfold increase in erosion from a year ago according to the 
us soil conservation service 
land is considered damaged by wind erosion if it loses at least 
five tons an acre an amount equal to a layer of soil as thick as a 
dime spread over an acre 
worse topsoil on millions of more acres on the great plains 
could blow away this winter if the prolonged drought that is 
destroying this years crops doesnt end in time for some plants to 
grow officials say 
this is as fine as you ever want to see it scs 
conservationist jay fuhrer said as he dug into a pile of fine dry 
dirt piled in a ditch near lincoln southeast of bismarck 
hills in the neighboring field were almost bare except for some 
weeds young shoots of grain had been sandblasted away by blowing 
dirt he said 
the green out here now is going to deteriorate fuhrer 
predicted bracing himself against wind that made the 102degree 
heat feel like a blast furnace 
if this dries before it makes straw it is just going to lay 
down and then we are not going to have any barrier at all thats 
what worries me now 
nationally wind erosion damage in 10 great plains states this 
winter and spring was triple the average figure the scs said 
spring droughts are very very unusual tom george the scs 
administrator in washington in charge of erosion surveys said 
tuesday thats seeding time and all those acres are exposed 
the drought is severe enough that it has even stunted the growth 
of weeds that could help protect the fragile topsoil said lyle 
samson state agronomist for the scs in north dakota 
north dakota has been the hardest hit about 12 percent of the 
states 30 million acres of cropland was damaged by wind erosion 
from november to may and an additional 74 million acres were 
considered vulnerable 
it is looking very bad said samson you have got to have 
hope for goodness sake it is june we have a lot of summer 
ahead of us whenever we receive rain it becomes a new ball game 
precipitation amounts in parts of central and western north 
dakota are the lowest they have been since 1936 according to the 
national weather service bismarck has received 42 inches of 
precipitation since sept 1 or 646 inches less than normal 
between november and may wind eroded at least 175 million tons 
of topsoil and blew strongly enough to damage 450000 acres of 
crops in north dakota sampson said 
last year 792300 acres of cropland were damaged by wind 
erosion and another 49 million acres were labeled vulnerable 
nationally 131 million acres in the great plains were damaged 
by wind erosion george said the average is 47 million acres an 
additional 194 million acres is listed vulnerable this year up 
from an average of 85 million 
south dakota has lost topsoil on 15 million acres montana has 
had 18 million acres eroded 
if the drought continues north dakota faces an awfully dirty 
winter of blowing dirt perhaps even worse than the dust bowl era 
when todays farm machinery wasnt available samson said 
the best conservation practices cannot guarantee protection 
against wind erosion in a drought he said 
you have to have rain he said we are just absolutely at 
the mercy of the elements 
the drought killing off most plant growth that protects the soil 
from the worst wind erosion during the winter also creates problems 
when heavy rain eventually breaks the cycle 
you have the paradox of the drought making you vulnerable to 
water erosion samson said

his alfalfa crop was devastated by the 
drought but bob atkinson was determined to find a profitable use 
for his parched farmland 
atkinsons field is next to the alpine valley music theater 
when 60000 fans turned out sunday for the first of four concerts 
by the rock group the grateful dead atkinson found uninvited 
guests in his fields 
we could either fight it or go along with it when they move 
in on you you might as well make the best of the situation 
atkinson said 
so atkinson is charging the 400 impromptu camper groups on his 
property 5 each and cutting his other crop losses 
atkinson said he like other farmers in southeastern wisconsin 
is suffering through the worst drought since the dust bowl days of 
the 1930s 
his alfalfa is 50 percent down and oats and wheat are basically 
shot he said 
and hes not thrilled with his human cash crop 
we wouldnt have done it if they hadnt moved in saturday 
night he said i dont like it id just as soon be at home

a federal agency labeled it a terrorist 
attack and a congressman equated it to putting razor blades in 
halloween candy 
nails had been driven into 200yearold douglas fir trees down 
the side of holcomb peak in southern oregons siskiyou mountains in 
a zigzag pattern like a spray of bullets from a machine gun 
the practice is called tree spiking an attempt to save trees by 
making it dangerous to cut them down and mill them when a loggers 
chainsaw or a band saw hits a nail it can break sending metal 
flying like shrapnel 
overall environmental groups believe that logging has reduced 
oldgrowth forests to 10 percent of the 25 million acres they once 
covered oregon and that represent a unique ecosystem that must be 
preserved 
treespiking is a radical environmentalists version of razor 
blades in halloween candy and rat poison in tylenol us rep 
bob smith rore said after the spiking was discovered last month 
endorsed in the 1985 primer for environmental sabotage 
ecodefense a field guide to monkeywrenching spiking has lost 
any legitimacy it may have had even among members of the radical 
environmental group earth first known as the monkeywrench gang 
which stages protests 
but this incident could well be a sign that the war of the woods 
is escalating as opponents become discouraged with the loss of the 
biggest trees in the forest environmentalists and federal 
officials say 
the way i see it its a last resort of people who are really 
totally frustrated with the process said robert brothers an 
earth first siskiyou activist who lives in this small community 
outside grants pass 
as long as they dont kill anybody its fine with me as long 
as they do it someplace else not in my backyard then we have to 
deal with talking about tree spiking pro and con instead of talking 
about oldgrowth pro and con 
steve marsden another earth first activist said he has seen 
spiked trees logged anyway and left on the forest floor to rot 
personally i dont think it works said marsden of wolf 
creek logging companies just cut them down to show they are the 
boss 
the holcomb peak spiking wont stop the area from being logged 
said hank snow vice president at medford corp which owns the 
right to log trees in the area he said the timber company would 
use metal detectors to look for spikes before cutting them down 
we dont like to even comment on spiking he said 
people are only seeking publicity 
timber is oregons leading industry providing 73900 jobs 
forest products output for 1986 in oregon was 34 billion 
according to the state department of economic development 
the holcomb peak incident was discovered after anonymous letters 
postmarked in chicago were received by the us bureau of land 
management and medford 
an axiom of tree spiking is to issue a warning so no one gets 
hurt although a california millworker was critically injured last 
year when a band saw broke on a spiked tree 
when news of the holcomb peak spiking failed to appear in local 
newspapers the spikers apparently got impatient and left nails 
along the side of a logging road to point the way said harold 
belisle manager of land managements grants pass resource area 
kurt austermann spokesman for medford district said the bureau 
of land management considers spiking terrorism austermann said 
monday that the reward for information about the spiking incident 
had reached 13000 
the holcomb peak incident was the third spiking in recent years 
in the medford district in southern oregon said linda schalk a 
law enforcement agent for the federal agency 
andy kerr of the oregon natural resources council said people 
who spike trees are frustrated with environmental organizations 
like his that stress negotiation legal action and building 
congressional support 
we get nasty letters from these people he said we 
wouldnt go out and sit in front of bulldozers or spike trees so 
were wimps 
litigation has been the most successful means of halting 
oldgrowth logging the latest victory for environmentalists came 
in a preliminary injunction issued by a federal appeals court that 
blocked 33 timber sales in oregon pending the outcome of a lawsuit 
over protection of the northern spotted owl the case was brought 
by a coalition of about a dozen environmental groups including the 
oregon natural resources coaltion

the house on tuesday approved a 282 billion 
fiscal 1989 defense bill that included 35 million for the 
administrations star wars antimissile program but continued for a 
fourth straight year a levelingoff of president reagans military 
buildup 
the vote was 360 to 53 
the bill which now goes to the senate represents about a 4 
percent cut in purchases of military weapons systems while 
increasing military pay and money for operation and maintenance 
reflecting congressional preference for maintaining readiness of 
fighting forces over developing new technology 
together with other money bills the defense measure would 
provide a total of 2996 billion for military and intelligence 
activities in the year that begins oct 1 essentially a freeze on 
defense spending for the fourth straight year 
for reagans star wars system the bill would provide 35 
billion in development money a reduction from the current years 
39 billion and far below the administrations request for 1989 of 
48 billion 
it provides 410 million to support drug enforcement including 
money for purchase of radar aircraft helicopters and patrol boats 
also included was an estimated 20 billion or so to fund us 
intelligence programs through the cia and other agencies the exact 
amount is classified 
military personnel would get a 4 percent pay increase under the 
bill which would maintain an activeduty strength of 21 million 
the increase is part of a 784 billion personnel budget 
another 807 billion is earmarked for buying weapons among 
bigticket items are 14 billion for 545 m1 abrams tanks 871 
million for 72 apache attack helicopters 19 billion for 66 
trident ii missiles 13 billion for a trident submarine 23 
billion for 84 fa18 fighter planes 21 billion for three 
destroyers 1 billion for four c17 transport planes and 807 
million for a dozen mx missiles 
the bill includes 100 million for rail basing of the mx 
missile 693 million less than the administration asked and 600 
million for the midgetman missile 400 million less than reagan 
wanted the balance between the small icbm and the railbased mx is 
expected to be settled in a housesenate conference on defense 
authorizing legislation 
as it considered the bill the house adopted an amendment by 
rep toby roth rwis requiring the navy to report on the causes 
and circumstances of death for 17 recruits who died during training 
since 1986 
roths amendment stems from the death of lee mirecki who died 
march 2 during navy rescue swimmer training in florida 
roth said he has been unable to obtain the results of a navy 
inquiry into the death 
the house also adopted an amendment by rep bob walker rpa 
stipulating that no federal money be spent in any workplace which 
is not drugfree 
at the same time the senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
tuesday adopted a similar 282 billion money bill and scheduled the 
measure for full committee action on friday 
that version included slightly more 37 billion for the 
star wars program and provided 199 million for drug interdiction 
the subcommittee approved an amendment by sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii giving israel the right to bid on the same basis as nato 
countries on defense procurement contracts

saturday as the premier spoke at a convention of his motherland 
party in ankara 
erbil tusalp a reporter in ankara for the istanbul daily

name of the source who provided him with a copy of the gunmans 
testimony according to halil nebiler another cumhuriyet reporter 
 
tusalps frontpage article which included the wouldbe 
assassins testimony was published monday in the moderateleftist 
newspaper 
police told the reporter that he was being detained for 
violating the secrecy of the investigation the state security 
court examining the attempted assassination ordered police and 
state officials not to comment on the investigation

office and demanded to search it but bureau chief yalcin dogan 
refused to allow the action without a court order 
chief prosecutor nusret demiral and his assistants have been 
interrogating demirag since saturday 
nebiler said tusalp was detained under demirals order 
tusalp reported that demirag said he did not have any 
accomplices in the shooting 
in the story the gunman was quoted as saying he chose the site 
of the shooting just to make it sensational and wanted to die 
because of poor health and psychological problems demirag was 
quoted as saying he thought he would be killed immediately by 
ozals security police

contradictory testimonies since he was arrested 
according to the istanbul daily hurriyet demirag said that he 
did not act alone but the report did not say which group he 
claimed to be working with or provide other details

reports the youth group is known as the gray wolves or the 
idealist clubs which were involved in a wave of terrorism that 
claimed 5000 lives in 197880 
mehmet ali agca the turkish gunman who shot and wounded pope 
john paul ii in 1981 also was accused of belonging to the gray 
wolves

foreign currency at the time of the shootings the dailies said 
cumhuriyet columnist ugur mumcu wrote on tuesday that demirag is 
using tactics similar to agcas to confuse investigators

fields are so dry because of the drought 
that one farmer returning home from his fields after a day of 
harvesting winter wheat turned around and found the field behind 
him ablaze 
regis krebs of beckemeyer a town of 1100 located 45 miles east 
of st louis had pointed his combine toward home when he noticed 
the fire which apparently was caused by a spark from the combines 
muffler 
id just as soon forget about it krebs said tuesday 
luckily it was just a minor fire it just burned a little corner 
of the field 
he lost a couple acres of wheat in about 10 minutes 
beckemeyer fire chief vincent pollman said of the monday night 
fire everything is bone dry and it went up quickly 
pollman said theres not a lot farmers can do to prevent those 
kinds of fires when fields become parched dry brittle grass and 
straw need very little to ignite in drought conditions he said 
all it takes is a spark from a hot muffler or for a bearing 
to go out and heat up pollman said as dry as its been around 
here im surprised we havent had more calls this summer we need 
a good rain

a state senator on tuesday proposed 
legislation that would require training for the gatekeepers who 
regularly deal with teenagers in an effort to prevent suicide 
sen nicholas spanos plan also would require that journalism 
classes train future reporters in the coverage of suicides and that 
posters with hot line numbers be put up in places frequented by 
teenagers 
under spanos proposals the states mental health commissioner 
would be required to develop a suicide prevention training program 
for guidance counselors social workers parent groups law 
enforcement personnel and other pertinent gatekeepers 
spano a repubican who chairs the senate mental hygiene 
committee charged that new york state was losing its battle to 
eliminate teen suicides 
spano issued a report that noted that in 1986 there were 112 
suicides in new york state of people ages 10 to 19 researchers 
have estimated that for every teenage suicide there are probably 
100 to 300 attempts he said 
training in journalism classes spano said would ensure a 
better understanding by future journalists of the impact a suicide 
story may have on an adolescent contemplating suicide or families 
of victims 
the legislation that would require journalism classes to teach 
about suicide reporting has no assembly sponsor thats usually a 
sign that the measure stands little chance of becoming law 
no quick action appears likely on any of the major portions of 
spanos package of seven bills only one has come out of committee 
to the full senate that would require uniform guidelines for 
hospital emergency rooms handling attempted suicides

actress loretta swit clashed politely tuesday 
with the female designer of the vietnam veterans memorial over a 
proposal to place a new statue near the memorial honoring the 
10000 women who are invisible veterans of the southeast asian 
conflict 
as cameras rolled miss swit told a house hearing that erecting 
an 8foot bronze statue of an army nurse at the 22acre memorial 
site would help heal the emotional wounds of female vietnam 
veterans 
the greatest tragedy of their service is that it has gone 
untold unrecognized and for the most part unknown said miss 
swit who played an army nurse in the longrunning tv series 
mash 
she was followed to the witness table by new york architect maya 
lin who strongly opposed any additions or major alterations to her 
design for the memorial a black granite wall bearing the names of 
58156 vietnam war dead including eight nurses 
noting that a statue of three combatweary infantrymen was added 
to the memorial at the insistence of former interior secretary 
james watt ms lin called the proposed nurses statue a 
misdirected attempt at titfortat equality for women 
i cannot foresee how quiet and respectful this area will 
remain if we continue to add to it or to adorn it filling the area 
with political concessions and turning the quiet sanctuary of the 
memorial into a cluttered sculpture garden she said 
the senate approved the womans statue last week 961 the lone 
dissenter sen daniel evans rwash warned that we are turning 
the vietnam memorial into something of a jumble 
at tuesdays hearing by a house post office and civil service 
subcommittee the proposal was endorsed by several members of 
congress and major veterans organizations but opposed by the 
commission of fine arts and the national capital planning 
commission 
the approval of both those independent agencies as well as the 
interior secretary is required before any monuments can be erected 
on national parkland in washington interior secretary donald hodel 
has approved adding a womans statue to the vietnam memorial 
rep sam gejdenson dconn applauded the supreme courts 
decision monday that upheld a new york city ordinance barring 
private allmale clubs from discriminating against women and said 
congress should make a similar decision about the vietnam memorial 
this is a male club gejdenson said i think we ought to 
break it up 
but laurie maurer a board member of the american institute of 
architects said adding a womans statue would be like drawing a 
mustache on another artists painting or putting an equestrian 
statue of george washington atop the washington monument to 
complete it 
shelley mastran a university geography professor from 
washington said adding a statue of a female nurse would amount to 
disneyfication of the vietnam memorial retired marine col 
mary evelyn bane said it would be discriminatory against female 
members of the military 
brown and ms lin said it would be preferable to build a 
memorial to all american women who have served in the armed forces 
since world war ii congress authorized such a monument in november 
1986 and a site at the main entrance to arlington national 
cemetery has been approved 
the vietnam memorial which was built with 11 million in 
private funds has become the most popular tourist attraction of 
any national monument in washington an estimated 20 million people 
have visited the memorial since it was dedicated in november 1982

the communist party is allowing a large group in 
estonia to make a small dent in its monopoly on political power 
but while the grassroots organization wants regional autonomy it 
largely backs kremlin policy 
the peoples front of estonia says its goal is to promote the 
partys program of perestroika or restructuring of soviet 
society launched by mikhail s gorbachev 
while its stated goal is to support moscows policies the 
political group appears to be tapping rising public dissatisfaction 
with the communist party which the central press has accused 
recently of being full of careerists with little concern for the 
people 
the peoples front is careful not to call itself a political 
party instead referring to itself in a 12point platform published 
june 7 in sovietskaya estonia as a democratic movement based on 
citizen initiative 
sovietskaya estonia reported june 11 the peoples front was 
formed in april and amassed 800 local affiliates throughout estonia 
with more than 40000 members 
formation of such a group as the peoples front would have been 
impossible before gorbachev became the partys general secretary in 
march 1985 and launched his glasnost policy which encourages 
openness on many political social and historical issues 
in 19851986 we learned bravely to think in 1987 bravely to 
speak and in 1988 its time to get experience in acting bravely 
one of the founders of the peoples front estonian economist edgar 
savisaar said in a june 7 article in sovietskaya estonia 
while generally supporting communist party policies the 
estonian group puts more emphasis on political and economic 
sovereignty of the 15 soviet republics and the cultural 
autonomy of the countrys more than 100 ethnic groups 
estonia on the baltic sea has been the scene last year and 
this year of several demonstrations asserting national rights 
extensive coverage of the peoples fronts activities in 
sovietskaya estonia the newspaper of estonias communist party and 
government shows the organization has official backing 
there was new evidence tuesday the estonian communist party is 
taking the peoples front seriously vajno i vaelaes named 
estonias communist party chief on thursday last week told the 
government newspaper izvestia some of the groups proposals have 
been included in a republic platform 
the platform is to be presented at a nationwide party conference 
on tuesday next week 
not all of the informal political groups formed under the banner 
of glasnost have had it so easy the democratic union a group 
dissidents formed may 9 as an alternative to the communist party 
has been harassed through arrests of group members after 
demonstrations in leningrad moscow and kiev the official press 
has sharply condemned the group 
the group says it intends to put forward candidates for 
government posts and suggest legislation to local governing 
councils called soviets it says it wants to fight corruption 
stagnation and stalinism all themes trumpeted recently by the 
communist party 
the only condition for membership is active and businesslike 
support of the course of perestroika of the communist party 
in an assurance to the government the group pledges to abide by 
the estonian constitution and the republics laws 
the 20 million member communist party describes itself as the 
leading and guiding force in soviet society and holds a monopoly 
on economic cultural and political power 
but the partys policymaking central committee has recommended 
that the allunion party conference convening in moscow on june 28 
encourage public organizations including public initiative 
bodies 
they should use their right to initiate bills send 
representatives to the bodies of power and be partners of the 
state in pursuing social programs according to the 
recommendations 
sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya a gorbachev adviser said last 
month she supports the idea of social institutions or peoples 
unions to assist and advise the party but she ruled out 
establishment of competing parties

the environmental protection agency said 
tuesday it plans to designate 215 more toxic wastes sites as 
eligible for money from the superfund toxic waste dump cleanup 
program 
in addition 14 more sites owned by federal agencies were 
proposed for the national priority list for cleanups though they 
are not eligible for superfund money 
the planned update of the list the seventh since the program 
began in 1982 would be the largest since june 1984 when 244 sites 
were announced 
tuesdays proposals would bring the priority list to 1177 sites 
799 formally designated and 378 awaiting designation 
in addition three sites have been deleted from the list because 
cleanup work is complete and proposals to list 30 more are being 
dropped because the agency now believes cleanups are better 
performed under other laws 
elaine stanley deputy head of superfund enforcement said 
actions are under way at most of the 30 sites all of which are 
owned by permit holders under the federal hazardous waste disposal 
laws 
jack mcgraw deputy assistant epa administrator in charge of 
superfund told reporters the change might even speed cleanups 
because many of the 30 are controlled by large companies who are 
eager to go ahead and try to reduce what they call their 
liability inventory 
thirteen of the 215 proposed sites involve hazardous waste 
facilities where epa does not believe the waste law can be used 
because the owner refuses to negotiate or for some other reason 
generally it takes a year to 18 months after proposal for 
public comment and agency response before a site is formally added 
to the priority list although epa sometimes begins studies of 
possible remedies before the final designation the agency says 97 
percent of proposed sites wind up on the list proposals generally 
are made once a year 
epa has 29463 places in its computers as potential hazardous 
waste sites and has completed investigations at 8875 only the 
worst threats to health and the environment according to a 
complicated numerical scoring system are proposed for the priority 
list 
the agency has said it expects about 2500 sites on the list 
eventually 
once on the list the site becomes eligible for 90 percent 
federal financing of the cleanup with the balance coming from the 
state unless it is owned by a state or local agency the federal 
government will pay only half the cleanup cost of those 
but before federal and state money is used epa tries to get the 
polluters responsible to clean up the site sometimes those people 
are bankrupt cannot be found or dispute their responsiblity epa 
can go ahead and do the work and seek reimbursement later 
the agency says it and the states have secured 600 million to 
700 million in cleanups from responsible parties 191 court cases 
are under way seeking 258 million and epa has been reimbursed for 
78 million in cleanup work it performed 
spending about 15 billion a year superfund is simultaneously 
one of the nations largest environmental programs and one of the 
largest public works programs 
mcgraw said epa tried to propose as many sites as possible to 
clear the pipeline before it begins changing the scoring system 
this summer to meet congressional directives 
those changes will among other things take into account 
threats to health through the food chain give greater weight to 
abandoned wells and try to account for potential later emissions of 
contaminants into the air 
the superfund program came in for renewed criticism in recent 
days 
last friday the congressional office of technology assessment 
said epa was largely ignoring congressional orders to prefer 
permanent cleanups such as incineration or waste treatment methods 
over leaving the waste in the ground and was overestimating costs 
of treatment 
on monday a waste treatment trade group and six environmental 
organizations echoed otas findings in testimony before a house 
subcommittee they also contended that epa was planning to leave 
widely varying waste concentrations behind when cleanups are 
complete 
we have a technical response to each criticism of specific 
cleanup decisions epa assistant administrator winston porter told 
the subcommittee he argued there was simply not enough money for 
incineration at every site

together the two groups bring the national priority list to 
1177 sites of which 378 are proposed sites and 799 have been

new hampshire on tuesday marked the 200th 
anniversary of its decisive role in uniting the nation under the 
constitution with a plea to remember all those wonderful purposes 
for which our government was formed 
the list of festivities commemorating new hampshires ninth and 
deciding vote to ratify the constitution included a speech by 
former us chief justice warren burger a lobster dinner for 1200 
on the statehouse lawn and bellringing by hundreds of children 
using a replica of the liberty bell 
new hampshires ratification created the united states in the 
true sense of a nation said burger chairman of the commission 
of the bicentennial of the us constitution 
when new hampshire took this action we really had a united 
states of america for the first time burger said during a 
statehouse ceremony 
supporters of the constitution knew the value of a power 
of any kind depends on having it in some kind of harness and that 
is the genius of our system 
burger also helped unveil a commemorative stamp portraying the 
old man of the mountain a granite formation in the white 
mountains that is the state symbol 
during a morning service at st pauls episcopal church the 
rev david glendinning urged americans to never lose touch with 
all those wonderful purposes for which our government was formed 
we are still and need to be one people he said adding 
that it is critical that americans not be overwhelmed by the 
institution of government 
state rep russell chase of the committee that planned the 
observance said its goal was to to learn more to know more to 
appreciate more the institution that has carried us these 200 
years 
new hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the constitution 
on june 21 1788 the vote by the states ratifying convention was 
5747 
the 13 original colonies already united by the articles of 
confederation had agreed the previous year in philadelphia that 
nine votes would be needed to ratify the new constitution which 
created a strong central government 
the ratification vote ended a long bitter debate federalists 
argued a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull 
the country out of a postwar recession antifederalists said the 
constitution laid the groundwork for the kind of tyrannical central 
government they fought in the revolutionary war 
religion also was an issue as many new hampshire residents 
opposed a passage eliminating any test of religion as a 
qualification for public office 
federalist politicking gained force because eight states 
delaware pennsylvania new jersey georgia connecticut 
massachusetts maryland and south carolina already stood behind 
the document 
five days after new hampshire voted virginia became the 10th 
state to ratify the constitution

two representatives of major jewish 
organizations met with a vatican envoy tuesday to protest pope john 
paul iis upcoming meetings in austria with president kurt waldheim 
dr avi beker of the world jewish congress and leon feldman 
representing three other jewish groups said at a news conference 
that they pointed out waldhiems past in nazi germanys army during 
a meeting with monsignor renzo fratini counselor of the apostolic 
delegation in jerusalem 
fratini confirmed the meeting and said in an interview that he 
would pass along the mens concern to the vatican which does not 
have diplomatic relations with israel 
all signs show the pope is displaying his will and going out 
of his way to legitimize waldheim that he is actually trying to 
penetrate public opinion in effect challenging the information 
campaign conducted by jewish groups beker said 
we expressed protest as well as a hope that perhaps the pope 
will now do what he failed to do during the previous visit and 
display some criticism about waldheims wartime activities and his 
lies about his past beker said 
jewish organizations have charged that waldheim was involved in 
nazi war crimes during his service with the german army during 
world war ii 
waldheim denies any wrongdoing but the united states has barred 
his entry into the country saying it found evidence he was 
involved in deportations of balkan civilians in world war ii 
feldman represents the bnai brith the american jewish 
committee and the synagogue council of america jewish 
organizations also protested a year ago when the pope met waldheim 
at the vatican 
during john pauls visit to austria he will meet waldheim on at 
least three occasions between june 2327 according to a copy of 
the popes itinerary supplied by the world jewish congress 
beker said the popes planned prayer service at the mauthausen 
concentration camp june 24 a day after he is received by waldheim 
was in particularly bad taste 
the visit to mauthausen which is to honor the holocaust 
victims is actually a desecration of their memory because of these 
meetings with waldheim he said

here are the sites proposed for deletion from 
those proposed earlier for the national priority list for 
superfund toxic waste cleanups by the environmental protection 
agency 
the agency said these sites generally are part of an 
installation holding a permit under the federal hazardous waste 
law although they may not be actively handling waste cleanups are 
better handled by the owner under that law although nothing 
prevents use of superfund later if it should prove desirable epa 
said 
in addition the agency deleted three sites from the list in 
april because work had been completed or there was no longer a 
threat from them they were the mountain view mobile home estates 
in globe ariz the middletown road dump in annapolis md and 
the harris site on farley street in houston texas

america is gaining in the war on 
drugs but must ensure money is spent on prosecution and jails as 
well as seizing illegal drugs attorney general ed meese told state 
attorneys general tuesday 
the sad truth is as long as enough people pay enough often 
enough for drugs somebodys going to find a way to get those drugs 
to them meese told about 40 attorneys general holding a fourday 
meeting 
several antidrug bills are pending before congress and meese 
said there will be a bipartisan executivelegislative summit 
during the next few weeks to fashion a bill that would have the 
support of both parties and both the executive and legislative 
branches 
on other matters meese again refuted allegations the justice 
department was slack in pursuing allegations of fraud in defense 
contracting 
it was the prompt and effective action by the department of 
justice working with the department of defense that brought the 
case to the point of investigation now he said 
the investigation is part of the reagan administrations 
unprecedented campaign against defense procurement fraud of all 
sorts he said 
meese said the publicity concerning the recent controversy and 
resignations at the justice department hasnt been helpful but 
he said the controversy hasnt affected the office one way or the 
other 
meese said that in the past the tendency has been to put 
antidrug money into intercepting drugs and education programs 
thats important but when thats done the congress has got to 
make sure we have the resources in prosecution on the court 
and in correctional facilities so we dont have the situation that 
often occurs in many of your states judges reluctant to impose 
appropriate sentences on people because they dont think theres 
enough room in the prisons 
meese said recent debate over whether drugs should be legalized 
is the result of frustration because progress is slow in the battle 
against drugs 
but he said recent surveys indicate use by high school students 
is down and argued that legalizing drugs has never worked in any 
society 
the united states signed an international agreement last year to 
join other nations in battling drugs and legalization would put 
us at odds with all the other civilized nations of the world 
meese added 
this is the worst time to change national policies on drugs he 
said because for the first time we are starting to make 
progress it certainly behooves us not to change our policies 
delaware attorney general charles oberly wondered if meese was 
not overstating the case about progress in the battle 
my feeling is we havent really seen any decrease in drug 
use he said 
meese agreed that we dont want to make too much out of 
statistics but added the important thing is to recognize 
there are changes in attitudes among high school students 
he said steppedup efforts are needed to extend drug education 
programs to high school dropouts and the unemployed

a deadly thunderstorm that caused the 
1985 crash of a delta air lines jumbo jet was visible to air 
traffic controllers but not to the aircrafts flight crew a delta 
pilot testified 
capt william melvin chairman of a safety committee for the 
airline pilots association also said the crew of flight 191 may 
have been set up by wind shear training because flight 
simulators did not include conditions comparable to the storm that 
caused the crash 
he the pilot could see the clouds he could see rain 
melvin testified monday but he couldnt see the cloud 
development because he was too close 
melvin a dallasbased pilot and wind shear expert who was part 
of the initial crash investigation was deltas final witness in a 
nonjury trial being heard by us district judge david o belew jr 
the l1011 widebody crashed aug 2 1985 killing 137 people and 
injuring 25 others while trying to land at dallasfort worth 
international airport 
delta claims government meteorologists and air traffic 
controllers failed to inform the crew of the worsening weather and 
wants the government to pay all or part of the claims facing the 
atlantabased airline delta and its insurance companies already 
have paid more than 90 million in death injury and damage claims 
and the final total is expected to exceed 100 million 
echoing testimony earlier in the trial by william haggard a 
meteorologist melvin said he believed a smaller milder rain cell 
masked the highaltitude development of the severe storm from the 
flight crew 
but observers south of the storm where air traffic controllers 
were located could clearly see the development melvin said 
national transportation safety board investigators determined 
that the crash resulted from a microburst a severe downburst from 
a thunderstorm their report said the microburst contained several 
wind shears or strong abrupt shifts in wind direction 
melvin said the crash was the first to document the presence of 
more than one wind shear in a single storm computerized wind shear 
models used in cockpit simulator training before the flight 191 
crash contained only one wind shear he testified 
the way pilots were trained is once you get through these 
things there wasnt any more said melvin that could have set 
up the pilots of delta 191 
lawyers for the government which contends the flight crew 
should have been able to avoid the crash are expected to begin 
presenting their case next week the trial which has been 
continuing for over three months is expected to continue for 
several more months

if people are willing to shell out 
10000 to buy a parking spot the town of south kingston cant 
stop raymond v mcconnell from selling the spaces 
the state supreme court ruled tuesday ruled that the town has no 
jurisdiction over mcconnells plan to sell 40 condominium parking 
spaces in his lot at popular green hill beach 
mcconnell and his wife have owned the lot for four years and 
have been collecting daily parking fees from beachgoers 
when mcconnell a dentist from coventry sought to sell 
permanent rights to the parking spaces south kingstown officials 
objected saying he would have to seek a subdivision permit from 
the town zoning and planning boards 
but chief justice thomas f fay in the high courts unanimous 
opinion wrote that mcconnells plan falls under the states 
condominium law which provides that plans to convert a property 
from rental to condominium ownership cannot be regulated by local 
boards 
the conversion of the mcconnells lot is a mere change in the 
form of its ownership and not a subdivision of land fay wrote 
because this parking area was not subject to subdivision 
requirements before its conversion it cannot be subject to these 
requirements afterward 
mcconnell said tuesday that while the legal fees may drive the 
price up beyond 10000 he expects no difficulty in selling the 
spaces 
the demand is there he said

twenty senators have told the reagan 
administration they are concerned that a proposed sale of 
sophisticated us fighters missiles and munitions to kuwait may 
pose a threat to israel and would further fuel the middle east arms 
race 
in a letter to secretary of state george p shultz the senators 
questioned the reasoning behind the sale decision asking whether 
kuwait has agreed to give more active protection to its own 
shipping in the persian gulf 
the letter was sent to shultz on friday and was made public 
tuesday 
the arms sale package includes 40 fa18 hornet fighter 
aircraft 40 harpoon missiles 120 sidewinder missiles 300 
maverick missiles 200 sparrow missiles 400 laserguided bombs and 
200 cluster bombs 
the senators said they are concerned that the combatrange of 
the hornet could be extended to permit attacks on israel by basing 
it in saudi arabia jordan or iraq or by adding larger fuel tanks 
accordingly we conclude that it is critically important to 
have the assurances of kuwait that these aircraft will never be 
based or deployed closer to israel than they would be at their base 
in kuwait and that they never will be based in or based to a state 
bordering israel the senators said 
they asked for assurances that kuwait will not seek and the us 
government will not sell equipment to extend the range of the 
planes 
additionally they said they are concerned that the highly 
accurate and reliable maverick missile might fall into unfriendly 
hands 
the maverick has destructive capabilities that far exceed the 
legitimate security requirements of kuwait the senators said and 
added we cannot afford to have our most sophisticated sensitive 
and efficient weapons sold without predictable and desirable 
consequences

of the senate foreign relations committee and these other senators

the national organization for women plans 
to urge likely democratic nominee michael dukakis to select rival 
jesse jackson or a nonwhite woman as his running mate the 
groups president said tuesday 
molly yard said it would take the selection of jackson who is 
very sensitive to womens issues or a woman from jacksons 
constituency to smooth relations between the womens movement and 
the democratic party 
the whole stance of the party since 1984 has been to blame us 
for the defeat of mondale and ferraro she said 
now the nations largest womens rights organization has been 
a major influence in democratic politics and was a factor in the 
selection of geraldine ferraro as walter mondales running mate in 
the 1984 presidential race the ticket later was defeated by the 
largest margin in the history of us presidential races 
ms yard said the group plans to introduce a resolution calling 
on dukakis to heed their advice on the vice presidential choice 
the now president did not provide a date for the resolution but 
the group is holding its national conference in buffalo this week 
dukakis is currently considering potential running mates 
jackson runnerup to the massachusetts governor in the delegate 
race has said he has earned the right to be offered the no 2 
spot but dukakis has not made any commitment 
yard also charged that democratic leaders have tried to keep now 
out of the 1988 election 
they say they dont want the party captive to special 
interests she said i dont know how they can call the 
nations largest group of voters a special interest 
there are 10 million more women registered to vote than men she 
said 
the now president also said the democratic party could lose the 
womens vote and the 1988 presidential election if it doesnt pay 
more attention to womens issues 
yard warned that millions of women would vote republican if the 
gop is perceived as caring more than the democrats about women 
even though their platform is a disaster theyll get votes 
because theyre seriously considering a woman as a vice 
presidential candidate yard said of the republicans 
everything depends on who you showcase at the convention 
she said 
elizabeth dole the former transportation secretary is 
considered a candidate for the no 2 spot on the gop ticket that 
will be headed by allbutcertain nominee george bush 
selection of mrs dole as a running mate could hand bush the 
presidency yard said mrs dole is the wife of kansas sen bob 
dole who battled bush unsuccessfully for the gop presidential 
nomination 
now calculates that dukakiss apparent early lead over bush 
could disappear if he loses a significant portion of the womens 
vote national polls indicate bush is running significantly behind 
dukakis among women while running about even among men 
its not the time for the democrats to send signals that they 
will in any way deny the importance of womens issues she said

the percentage of jobless workers drawing 
unemployment benefits declined for the fourth year in 1987 as more 
states tightened their eligibility requirements according to a 
study released tuesday 
in a 14page analysis of labor department records the center on 
budget and priorities a liberal foundationfinanced research 
group said the unemployment insurance system protected only about 
315 percent of the jobless last year 
an average of 51 million of the 74 million unemployed 
workers each month in 1987 did not receive unemployement insurance 
benefits the center said 
the 315 percent of jobless workers drawing benefits which 
across the country average 139 a week is the lowest on record 
dating back to 1955 according to the report the respective rates 
of coverage in 1986 and 1985 were 327 percent and 329 percent 
coverage varied sharply among the states ranging from a low of 
166 percent of the unemployed workers receiving benefits in 
virginia to a high of 585 percent in rhode island 
the maximum benefits also differ widely from state to state 
according to 1988 labor department data alabama is the lowest 
providing covered unemployed workers with a maximum of 120 a week 
massachusetts is the highest at 354 per week 
the center said seven straight years of national unemployment 
rates of 7 percent or greater 1980 to 1986 forced many states 
to raise their eligibility requirements and cut benefits to keep 
their unemployment insurance funds solvent and replace borrowings 
from the federal trust fund 
it quoted a house ways and means committee report that 37 states 
in 1987 increased their earnings requirements for drawing maximum 
benefits while only three states relaxed them

a harvard professor nearing completion of a 
report on the relative financial value of work done by different 
types of doctors said tuesday he believes his approach ultimately 
will be embraced though not loved by the medical profession 
within the medical community there is a strong perception 
that the fee structure is totally out of kilter william c hsiao 
told reporters 
however he acknowledged that a revised fee schedule based on 
the relative value scale his team is finalizing will hold out the 
prospect of winners and losers in the economic arena and thus 
will be controversial among doctors 
on the other hand he expressed confidence that the medical 
community as a whole accepts the premise that something must be 
done to temper doctor bills rising at about 15 percent a year 
and because hsiaos harvard team worked closely with the 
american medical association and panels of physician advisers from 
the various specialities he said he belives the plan ultimately 
will be accepted by doctors as preferable to potential alternatives 
over which they have no control 
moreover hsiao continued the fact that there are likely to be 
many more winners than losers among the nations 500000 
doctors suggests another pragmatic reason to predict ultimate 
acceptance of the plan 
the 1000page report flowing from the 2year 25 million 
study is due at the health care financing administration which 
oversees medicare and medicaid by july 31 and is to be made 
public by the end of august 
hsiao said he did not expect it to have an immediate impact but 
predicted congress will start hearings on it next spring and 
probably will use the document in making budget decisions for 
fiscal 1990 
the project has generated keen interest within the medical 
community because it raises the specter of massive changes in the 
way doctors bill their patients 
hsiao declined to go into details of the report but gave one 
example of what he called an irrational price structure existing 
in the physician market 
the present structure gives an incentive for doctors to perform 
a 300 30minute procedure to detect ulcers by inserting a tube 
down a patients throat while a complete physicial examination 
taking about 45 minutes could accomplish the same degree of 
diagnostic accuracy the catch the doctor could charge only about 
75 for such a noninvasive examination 
the most obvious result of the report financed mostly with 
federal money would be changes in the amount medicare will pay for 
each of the 7000 different medical procedures assigned a numerical 
code 
however private insurance companies use the same code system 
and hsiao said several of them have expressed interest in using 
information from the forthcoming report to do pilot studies of the 
way they pay bills

childwelfare officials sought temporary custody 
of five children tuesday after their mother was charged with 
abandonment for leaving them without explanation at a hospital 
emergency room 
brenda shed 31 who had been cited for neglect two years 
earlier was arrested early tuesday after being interviewed by 
police and caseworkers for the state department of children and 
family services said police youth division officer terry belinski 
she was held pending a bail hearing and also is scheduled for a 
probable cause hearing wednesday on the felony abandonment charge 
belinski said 
ms shed was cited by the dcfs for neglect in 1986 and her four 
children then were placed in foster care for seven months said 
dave schneidman a spokesman for the childwelfare agency 
police said she had been arrested previously on shoplifting 
charges and schneidman said she admitted to having a codeine habit 
in tuesdays interview 
the five children girls aged 2 4 and 5 and twin 9yearold 
boys remained in an emergency shelter while dcfs officials sought 
a court order to obtain temporary custody 
officials also were trying to find the children a foster home 
shell get to see the kids at some point but they havent 
asked to see her said schneidman they seem to be pretty 
passive about their fate and she the mother does too and thats 
usually a bad sign 
people in this situation usually show some emotion they 
scream they cry they defend themselves he said 
the children were examined monday and found to be healthy they 
were welldressed and the three schoolaged children had 
schoolbooks said belinski 
police said ms shed told them she was financially stressed 
and had been evicted from a private apartment into which she moved 
three months earlier from public housing 
according to ms sheds account her 40yearold sister 
dorothy came to the apartment as they were being evicted monday 
and said she would drive the family to a publicaid shelter 
instead dorothy shed drove to cook county hospital and while 
her younger sister waited in the car took the children to the 
emergency room there she left brenda sheds name and told a 
security guard ill pick these children up thursday 
youth division officers picked up dorothy shed late monday and 
charged her with contributing to the dependency of a child a 
misdemeanor said belinski she is scheduled to appear in court 
july 8 
but schneidman said the children gave a different account 
they said their aunt was driving around and trying to give 
their mother advice but that their mother seemed to be interested 
only in talking about her boyfriend said schneidman 
they said the aunt became disgusted and drove to the county 
hospital because its one of the few places where poor people feel 
welcome and where she knew theyd get attention he continued 
schneidman said brenda shed was cited for neglect in 1986 after 
the children were found living alone for four days with only 
minimal food and a neighbor looking in on them once a day 
but a juvenile court judge ordered the family reunited in 
november 1986 and called the case closed said schneidman 
there was no followup investigation since then

a coalition of business government and 
consumer leaders reported on tuesday that increases in energy 
efficiency can substantially improve the affordability of housing 
the alliance to save energy and its chairman sen tim wirth 
dcolo reported that fuel bills after mortgage and rent 
payments are the largest housing expense for the typical american 
family averaging 1100 annually 
the alliance released a report which shows that a 25 percent cut 
in energy costs saving 25 billion annually could make housing 
more affordable for 2 million households half of whom are 
lowincome families 
while typical middleincome households spend about onefifth 
of housing costs on energy many lowincome families spend more 
than onethird the alliance said in the report major changes 
in energy expenses can thus increase or decrease housing 
affordability significantly 
wirth told a capitol hill news conference it is our firm 
belief that an enlightened energy policy can help ease the housing 
problem we have today if we are able to follow the recommendations 
laid out by the alliance report to make housing more affordable 
through energy efficiency if we are able to link together the 
imperatives of energy conservation and energy efficiency we can 
help to ease this very real housing crisis today 
among its conclusions the panel recommended federal initiatives 
to 
restore the federal responsibility for setting energy standards 
for public and subsidized housing 
require states to establish home energy rating systems within 
basic federal guidelines 
add energy efficiency investment incentives to housing finance 
programs 
incorporate energy efficiency provisions in rental assistance 
programs 
create tax incentives for housing energy efficiency to 
stimulate more efficient construction and renovation practices 
especially in low income housing 
require individual metering in federally assisted rental 
housing while requiring such buildings to meet high energy 
standards 
founded in 1977 the alliance is a nonprofit coalition of 
business government and consumer leaders dedicated to increasing 
the efficiency of energy use the alliance conducts research pilot 
projects education programs and policy advocacy

the advisers to a black teenager who said she 
was assaulted by six white men last fall denied tuesday a claim 
that one adviser hired someone to tape his conversations with the 
other two 
samuel mcclease who said he was hired by the rev al sharpton 
to bug lawyer c vernon mason said his tapes showed that the 
advisers didnt believe the story told by teenager tawana 
brawley but that the three were using her case for personal gain 
mason sharpton and lawyer alton maddox asserted during a 
twohour interview tuesday that mcclease was lying and that he did 
not have the ability to carry out a secret electronic surveillance 
on the other hand they said mcclease was forced by some law 
enforcement organization to plant the bugs to make sharpton look 
bad and destroy the unity of the brawley advisers 
they accused wcbs television which broke the bugging story 
monday of corruption and racism for not checking mccleases 
credibility before putting him on the air 
the three men made their allegations on wlib radio they would 
not talk to reporters afterward 
no tape of the purported bugging was broadcast by wcbs during 
its interview with mcclease asked whether it had such tape the 
station issued a statement that said were confident that the 
tapes exist and that the story will continue to unfold 
miss brawley 16 of wappingers falls and her family have 
refused to cooperate with the grand jury which state attorney 
general robert abrams said has been stymied in trying to learn what 
happened during the four days last november when miss brawley said 
she was kidnapped and raped by six white men one of whom had a 
badge 
the three advisers contend the investigation has fallen prey to 
racism and say black people cannot get justice in new york state 
the teenagers mother has been in a church since last week when 
she sought refuge to avoid arrest for contempt for refusing to 
cooperate with the grand jury

an arab man accused of driving a car 
containing explosives aboard an israelibound ferry will appear in 
court wednesday on illegal arms possession charges the government 
announced 
a merchant marine ministry statement issued tuesday identified 
the suspect as omar mohammed sofrini and said he carried a west 
german passport 
it said a car allegedly driven by sofrini aboard the ferry 
paloma in the athens port of piraeus contained a revolver equipped 
with a silencer 101 bullets 19 bottles packed with explosives and 
detonators 
sofrini is being held in piraeus pending his court appearance 
according to the statement 
the explosives were discovered by port authorities and israeli 
security officials on monday shortly before the 3895ton paloma 
was to set sail with 400 passengers and 100 crew members also on 
the cyriotregistered ship were about 200 cars piraeus officials 
reported 
they said the vessel departed monday about four hours later

a palestine liberation organization officials 
ideas about peacefully settling disputes with israel contain a 
constructive tone and some positive points but lack 
authoritative backing from the plo leadership the state department 
said tuesday 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley was commenting on a paper 
circulated to journalists at the arab summit meeting earlier this 
month in algiers and attributed to bassam abu sharif plo chief 
yasser arafats tunisbased adviser 
the summit announced financial support for the current uprising 
by palestinians in the israelioccupied territories while abu 
sharifs material talked of israelis and palestinians living side 
by side in peace and cooperation 
it suggested direct peace talks and an internationally 
supervised referendum on the west bank and gaza strip to establish 
whether the plo should represent palestinians 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy told a news 
conference in saudi arabia last weekend that the paper lacked the 
strident rhetoric of other palestinian statements and 
represented a contribution to a rational discussion of the 
middle east problem 
he also noted that no israeli would sit down with the plo in 
the present conditions of that organizations nonrecognition of 
israel 
asked to comment mrs oakley said the big question is how 
authoritative is the algiers statement does it represent 
official plo policy she asked then added 
we note the constructive tone which the article conveys in 
general as well as some positive points if the plo is serious 
about moderating its position so as to make a practical condition 
to the peace process it can do so in an authoritative way we have 
yet to see such an authoritative statement

world leaders agreed tuesday to do more to lift 
the tremendous foreign debt burdens shouldered by the poorest 
countries but made no new effort to help the giant debtors of latin 
america 
in their final communique the seven leaders attending the 
annual economic summit of industrialized nations backed a plan 
offering a variety of options including slashing interest rates 
and forgiving some loans to ease the debt load of mostly poor 
countries in subsaharan africa 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy said the fresh move 
offers a message of hope to the poorest countries 
i think its very important news for countries in a very 
difficult position he told reporters 
but the leaders said the debt problems of the socalled 
middleincome countries like brazil and mexico should be 
handled on a casebycase basis a strategy fashioned in recent 
years to deal individually with these debtors 
the leaders acknowledged that the big debtors continue to have 
difficulties servicing their external debt and generating the 
investment necessary for sustainable growth 
but they said the marketoriented growthled strategy based 
on the casebycase approach remains the only viable approach for 
overcoming their external debt problems 
brazil and mexico the developing worlds largest debtors have 
foreign debts totaling a combined 220 billion 
the 44 countries that make up subsaharan africa rang up debts 
of about 120 billion at the end of 1987 according to the 
international monetary fund 
the total foreign debt of the developing world is estimated at 
approximately 1 trillion 
allen sinai chief economist at the boston co said the 
leaders action looks like really more of the same its a 
constructive windowdressing statement on what is a totally 
intractable situation he said 
there is no way at any summit that what in reality remains an 
albatross around the worlds neck can be resolved he said 
sally sheltoncolby an international financial consultant in 
washington dc said the she doubted the new african plan would 
have any appreciable effect on the debt problem 
its a step in the right direction she said but i dont 
think the importance of it should be exaggerated 
she was skeptical that the reagan administration in its seven 
remaining months in office would take advantage of the new program 
i cant imagine the reagan administration granting meaningful 
debt relief to the poorest of the poor countries she said 
its not a high priority she said 
the reagan administration backed off from its previous refusal 
to go along with debt concessions enabling the summit leaders to 
adopt the fresh measures 
the plan for the poorest debtors calls for the creditor 
countries to reschedule the official debt of these countries 
within a framework of comparability the leaders statement said 
the governments it said would have several options for easing 
the debt burdens 
they include reducing interest rates on shorterterm loans 
extending repayment periods at higher market interest rates 
partially writing off loans or a combination of these options 
this approach allows official creditors to choose options 
consistent with their legal or budgetary constraints the 
statement said 
the united states has said it cannot legally write off loans or 
grant concessionary interest rates but can extend interest 
repayment periods 
the program would apply only to official or government debt and 
not to loans incurred from commercial banks 
beregovoy said that to qualify for the relief package a country 
must have a very low percapita income and be following economic 
policies approved by the international monetary fund 
moreover a countrys annual debt payments must eat up 30 
percent of its earnings from export sales 
beregovoy estimated that 30 countries mostly in subsaharan 
africa but a few in asia would qualify 
he estimated that roughly 10 billion to 15 billion of the 
countries total debts would fall under the program 
the total cost to france he said would be about 130 million 
year 
details of the plan are to be worked out by the end of the year 
by the paris club a group of 17 western creditor countries which 
renegotiates debt owed them 
prior to the summit french president francois mitterrand and 
nigel lawson britains top financial officer urged relief for 
these countries 
japans finance minister kiichi miyazawa offered a complicated 
plan to help the bigger debtor countries but no action was taken on 
that 
several officials complained of not having enough time to study 
the japanese proposal which calls for the debtors to deposit some 
of their international reserves with the international monetary 
fund 
the plan while not accepted at the summit will certainly 
prompt more discussion at later meetings

a federal safety board urged broader testing 
for drugs among railroad workers tuesday when drug use is 
suspected but the panel did not endorse a farranging random 
testing program for the industry as urged by the transportation 
department 
the national transportation safety board called on the federal 
government and industry to step up its programs aimed at finding 
drug users among railroad workers it said last year 29 railroad 
accidents involved some drug or alcohol use and in 10 cases the use 
was linked directly to the cause of the accident 
a federal railroad administration rule which went into effect in 
early 1987 requires drug tests to be performed after an accident 
but the rule applies only to accidents involving a fatality or more 
than 500000 damage 
the ntsb said the requirement for such tests should be broadened 
to any accident involving an injury or damage of 150000 and also 
be required whenever a personss work habits or actions such as 
chronic absenteeism indicates an alcohol or drug problem 
the safety board also said the federal railroad administration 
should require railroad employees involved in safetyrelated jobs 
to obtain medical certificates and undergo periodic medical tests 
that include drug screening 
the safety board has no authority to impose such requirements 
and may only make recommendations to the fra and the railroad 
industry 
the board praised the fras postaccident drug and alcohol 
testing requirements but urged that they be broadened to include 
more workers including supervisors whose actions might be 
connected with an accident 
it also called for tests to be conducted more quickly after an 
accident saying in some cases last year workers were not tested 
for 13 hours to 26 hours after an accident 
the transportation department has proposed a wideranging drug 
testing requirement for the railroad industry it currently is 
going through the public hearing stages before being developed into 
a final regulation 
the departments proposal includes random testing for drugs 
among railroad employees the safety board however has not 
endorsed the random testing approach 
ntsb chairman jim burnett said tuesday that for random tests to 
be effective far more tests would have to be required than 
currently is being planned 
he said the government and industry would be more successful in 
ridding railroads of drug problems by targeting tests toward 
those workers who are suspected of drug use through their actions 
or involvement in work rule violations or accidents

iran and iraq said they launched air 
attacks on each others battlefield positions tuesday while 
iranian rebels fought to hang on to a shattered border town they 
took over the weekend 
the iraqbased rebels known as the national liberation army 
said they killed or wounded 8000 iranian soldiers in sundays 
battle for mehran 100 miles east of the iraqi capital baghdad 
they said several women were among 57 of their fighters who died 
a rebel communique said women were on the front lines where 
they were deployed as mortar crews giving cover fire for advancing 
troops the communique was sent by telex to the associated press in 
nicosia 
the communique said rebel forces on tuesday held foohills north 
and south of mehran and the highway to dehloran 75 miles to the 
south in iran 
iran which has said iraqi forces took mehran said its air 
force flew eight sorties against iraqi positions around the town 
the bombing and artillery duels killed enemy soldiers destroyed 
vehicles and set fortifications on fire the islamic republic news 
agency said in a war communique monitored in nicosia 
iraq and the rebels deny any iraqi troops took part

positions in northern sulimaniyeh province irna said the news 
agency also reported fighting on the ground between iraqi troops 
and kurds opposed to the baghdad government fighting next to 
iranian soldiers the two sides have been battling for mountain 
peaks in the region 
the official iraqi news agency said that during fighting in the 
north its ground forces shot down an iranian f5 tuesday morning 
iran had no immediate comment 
iraq said its air force flew 313 combat missions tuesday and 
lost no aircraft ina said the total included 84 combat missions by 
jet fighters and 229 by helicopter gunships 
the continued high total in gunship missions indicates the two 
sides are locked in heavy ground fighting as iraq uses helicopters 
to counter iranian force on the ground 
the national liberation armys hold on mehran since sunday is 
the longest time the rebel force has spent inside iran since it 
formed a year ago its previous pattern has been to inflict as much 
damage as possible and withdraw the group has said it does not 
intend to keep its fighters around mehran 
iran and iraq locked in a nearly 8yearold war have each 
captured and lost mehran several times 
the iranian casualties claimed by the rebels could not be 
independently confirmed but reporters saw more than 1500 iranian 
prisoners brought across the border to badrah on monday 
the rebels did not say how many fighters were committed to the 
battle for mehran but the assault force involved an estimated 
several thousand men and women along a 30mile front

and a french warship rushed to help a small boat that put out a 
distress signal late tuesday in the same area where iran attacked 
two commercial vessels two weeks ago

they identified it as the nada and said its greek crew of six 
radioed they were abandoning the vessel in life rafts near the 
saudi arabian oil terminal of ras tanura

warships were involved the us navy recently has said it would 
help neutral vessels regardless of which flag they fly if 
attacked in the vicinity of a us warship

leaders at the economic summit on tuesday 
rejected president reagans plan to reform bloated farm subsidy 
programs after european and japanese leaders refused to make 
sweeping promises on cutting the support payments 
the farm issue proved the most divisive of the generally 
harmonious threeday summit even britain the most reformminded 
of the west european nations dismissed the reagan plan as 
totally unrealistic 
the president attending his final summit session appeared 
undaunted even though his colleagues had spurned his plea for 
change 
reagan acknowledged that there are some differences of 
opinion on the subsidies question but added i am not going to 
give up on that 
the final communique issued tuesday fell well short of the 
signal for urgent action some us officials had hoped to send to 
the crucial general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt talks in 
december in montreal 
the summit leaders effectively ignored the reagan proposal 
which called for the elimination of all farm subsidies by the year 
2000 instead the communique said the countries should work simply 
for a reduction of the support payments to farmers 
many officials agree that the payments pose a problem since 
they drain national treasuries of nearly 200 billion a year 
encourage huge surpluses and harm the trade prospects of 
agriculturedependent third world economies 
but many also contend that drastic reform of the system would be 
politically untenable 
the communique said the leaders supported both the framework 
approach of trying to find an overall solution favored by the 
americans and also the shortterm measures which britain france 
west germany italy and japan feel are the most that can be 
achieved canada the host had sought a compromise 
the midterm review will provide a unique opportunity to send 
a credible political signal to the trading world said the 
communique 
we suport efforts to adopt a framework approach including 
short as well as long term elements which will promote the reform 
process and relieve current strains in the agricultural 
markets the communique said 
at their final meeting tuesday morning the seven leaders 
slightly strengthened the vague language on farm subsidies the 
communique said the trade negotiators must as opposed to 
should in the draft communique composed by officials take 
both shortterm options and longterm goals 
but the leaders in a communiqueapproving session that ran an 
hour over the scheduled two hours also included another escape 
clause by drawing attention to the diversity of our agricultural 
situations 
britain for example has few farmers most of whom are 
efficient and wealthy west germany and france have electorally 
important lobbies of smalltime farmers who depend heavily on 
subsidies 
the communique also said subsidy cutbacks must take account of 
social concerns 
according to figures produced by the 24nation organization for 
economic cooperation and development japan has the most heavily 
subsidized system offering a 75 percent subsidy for its 
agriculture in 1986 up from 54 percent in 1980 
european economic community subsidies totaled 49 percent in 
1986 up from 36 percent in 1980 and us subsidies were 35 
percent up from 15 percent 
the eec to which the four european nations at the summit 
belong agreed to farreaching measures last spring designed to 
impose permanent curbs on production through automatic subsidy 
cutoff when farmers exceed quotas 
but officials note the agreement will only slow down increases 
in subsidies rather than impose an immediate freeze 
it is the right of everyone to have expectations even great 
expectations but it is not very productive to be dreaming without 
reality willy de clerq the eec foreign affairs commissioner 
said of the deadlock

leslie manigat said 
tuesday he would try to rally world opposition to the military 
establishment that ousted him as president of haiti but expressed 
little hope of returning to power 
he told a news conference in the dominican republic which 
shares the caribbean island of hispaniola with haiti that he had 
telephoned foreign leaders and international organizations 
requesting support 
manigat said he believed the government lt gen henri namphy 
announced monday was fragile because the armed forces cohesion 
behind gen namphy is artificial and temporary 
the former political science professor added however that the 
end of his 4monthold government meant the army had won a 
point in the contest between military and civilian rule 
about his personal plans he said 
im not going to fall into the classic trap of deposed 
political men who see the return to power from one moment to the 
other and pass all their time waiting for that imminent return im 
not only a politician but a political scientist i can avoid that 
vision that force of mistaken politics and personal frustration 
i dont have any bitterness nor personal rancor i am sad for 
my country for my people and for haitian democracy 
manigat 57 claimed widespread corruption in the military led 
to the coup which occurred after he took sides in what appeared to 
be an internal military conflict 
he said he had tried to bring reforms to haiti but the military 
undercut him and democratic elements did not support his 
government opposition political leaders claim fraud in the jan 17 
election which manigat won with the armys help 
my government has been overthrown for specific reasons the 
resistance and reaction of various powerful interests to my action 
of struggle against the corruption and against smuggling in the 
military he said 
my government represented the only and final chance for 
democracy the other democratic sectors have understood that too 
late and it was their political mistake to refuse the public 
support that would have strengthened my government 
the coup sprang from the unilateral initiative of gen 
namphy he said 
namphy and his friends were openly criticizing the 
administrative reform that i was developing to reestablish 
administrative honesty and to clean up the public administration 
and the public service sector manigat told reporters 
he said the general was irritated by seeing me revoke his 
corrupt friends placed in key positions of the public 
administration he said those friends turned to namphy for help 
and eventually constituted a hostile climate even a hostile 
network against my government 
security problems in the country were the work in great 
measure of the sectors inside the armed forces themselves 
manigat said

soviet officials told western diplomats tuesday 
that exit visas will be granted to a jewish family president reagan 
considered visiting during the moscow summit 
reagan had cancelled the visit for fear of dooming the familys 
chance to emigrate 
the informal notice passed by soviet foreign ministry officials 
to diplomats in moscow washington and canberra australia 
signaled an aboutface in the case of yuri and tanya zieman a week 
ago the ziemans were officially informed their appeal for 
permission to leave the country had been rejected 
mrs zieman said tuesday she had heard the reports from 
australian and other diplomats but she had no indication from 
soviet authorities that her familys 11year quest for exit visas 
was at an end 
an american official speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that the us government had been informed at the level 
of a senior officer that the zieman case was about to be 
resolved he refused to be more specific 
the ziemans 12yearold daughter vera who calls herself a 
lifelong refusenik had appealed to the president and mrs reagan 
for help in gaining visas the reagans considered visiting her at 
the familys threeroom apartment in southwest moscow during their 
trip to moscow three weeks ago 
but soviet officials sent word they would regard it as a direct 
insult to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev if the reagans visited 
him in the kremlin and then stopped by the zieman home one said 
the reagans would be behaving as if they had two hosts for the 
official visit 
us sources speaking on condition they not be identified said 
deputy foreign minister alexandr bessmertnykh had told us 
ambassador jack f matlock that if the reagans visited the ziemans 
the family would never be permitted to leave the country 
the president called off the visit but the ziemans did attend a 
tea the reagans gave for people the us administration considers 
victims of soviet human rights abuses vera a pianist recently 
received a gift from the reagans of music tapes 
yuri zieman a computer specialist who lost his job when he 
applied to emigrate in 1977 worked as a plumber until stricken 
several months ago by a brain ailment that has left him with double 
vision and a loss of balance 
the condition diagnosed by some soviet physicians as a 
potentially deadly enlargement of an artery made the familys 
quest more urgent because zieman was advised by his doctors not to 
undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the soviet union 
zieman has been told he was not permitted to leave the country 
for security reasons although he contends he never had access to 
state secrets and has no information that could threaten soviet 
security 
the ziemans have an older daughter who was permitted to emigrate 
last year with her husband they now live in the boston area

investment tip sheets can be forced to tell 
readers that they were given financial inducements by a company to 
print an article touting the firms stock a federal appeals court 
ruled thursday 
but the court rejected the securities and exchange commissions 
contention such publications must tell readers that a featured 
company provided the article or paid the writer who composed it 
deciding whether the text of a particular article was 
substantially provided by the company would be an intrusion in 
the editorial process that is prohibited by the first amendment 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled 
the court however revived a lawsuit by the sec to force stock 
market magazine to tell readers if feature articles about companies 
were carried as a result of other financial inducements 
these arrangements could include a companys agreement to buy 
advertising in the publication or purchase reprints of the feature 
article the court said in an opinion by circuit judge laurence 
silberman 
the sec had sought the injunction to enforce the antitouting 
provisions of the 1933 securities act which were designed to 
prohibit publication of investment tips under the guise of 
journalism by people with a financial interest in a stocks value 
the case was sent back to us district judge aubrey e robinson 
jr who had thrown out the secs suit first amendment grounds to 
determine if the existence of such quid pro quo financial 
arrangements warranted an injuction against the monthly magazine 
if they did exist we have no doubt that an injunction could 
be fashioned to require disclosure when consideration is paid in 
this distinct form without trameling fully protected speech or 
interfering with editorial practices silberman wrote in an 
opinion joined by circuit judge douglas h ginsburg judge carl 
mcgowan the panels third member who had concurred in the opinion 
died last december 
requiring disclosure of such payments would not interfere with 
either editorial judgments concerning the content of the feature 
articles or news gathering practices silberman said 
but the court said such interference would occur if the sec 
sought to require disclosure that the article was planted by the 
company either by providing a free copy of the text or paying a 
freelance journalist to write it 
that would result in both the sec and court interference with 
the crucial process of editorial control interference that the 
supreme court has decried as particularly repugnant to core first 
amendment concerns silberman wrote 
the magazines attorney joseph h sharlitt said his clients 
first amendment position has been vindicated 
but sharlitt said the courts decision gives the sec the right 
to look at the financial records of the financial press and compare 
that with the content of its articles and make a determination 
whether there has been some sort of tiein deal 
under this decision the sec could enjoin publication of a 
magazine on the basis of one article that was printed as a result 
of a financial inducement he said 
sharlitt denied the secs allegations that stock market magazine 
received financial inducements to print the articles 
he said he was unsure whether the magazine had legal standing to 
appeal the decision because the sec had not obtained an injunction 
against it 
richard kirby the secs assistant general counsel said the 
decision was significant in the respect we can clearly now 
enforce the statute in certain important respects

house members on tuesday vowed to increase 
efforts to prevent construction of a massive shopping center 
adjacent to the manassas national battlefield park 
were really a case of last resort here rep mike andrews 
dtexas told a house panel were either going to save the 
battlefield or let a developer literally put one of the nations 
biggest shopping malls right next door 
im interested in coming up with a policy for these matters 
said rep bruce vento dminn who chairs the interior and insular 
affairs subcommittee on national parks and public lands the 
preservation of resources is a priority of the national park 
service 
congress became involved in the development dispute after local 
opponents of the project charged that government officials and 
builders in prince william county va tricked them by first 
proposing a small office park and then switching to a 12 million 
square foot mall 
the battlefield located 27 miles west of washington dc was 
the site of the first significant land battle of the civil war a 
surprising confederate triumph in that 1861 fight helped convince 
union leaders that the war would be a protracted affair 
the second battle fought over a threeday span in august 1862 
saw a bloody decisive confederate victory that set the stage for 
rebel attacks on the north 
the present fight centers around a 542acre tract adjacent to 
the federally run park where developers first proposed building the 
mall they agreed to move the mall some 600 feet after historians 
noted that a hill in the middle of the disputed land was the site 
from which gen robert e lee directed confederate forces in the 
second battle of manassas 
that single concession however has not satisfied opponents 
who charge that the construction of a mall that large will forever 
destroy the sanctity of the stillrural area where 20000 
casualties were recorded in the second contest 
andrews and rep robert mrazek dny have introduced 
legislation that would direct the interior department to purchase 
the disputed tract and add it to the park while rep frank wolf 
rva has proposed that congress buy the land directly a faster 
move than waiting up to 10 years for the federal agency to act 
both measures would also close roads now running through the 
battlefields 
wolf also wants the federal government to pay for construction 
of new highways around the 4600acre battlefield park which 
virginia state highway officials say would cost 101 million

the united states is trying to transform the 
annual summit of western industrialized countries into a permanent 
body that would try to run the world president francois mitterrand 
of france said tuesday 
mitterrand who clashed repeatedly with president reagan during 
the threeday meeting said he objected to a plan for an 
international sevennation drug task force because he considered it 
the latest american attempt to establish a new organization 
in whose name do these seven countries decide for the rest of 
the world asked mitterrand who was reelected last month to a 
second sevenyear term 
speaking to reporters he criticized what he called the 
tendency or strategy of the united states to transform this summit 
into a permanent institution leaving each time organizations which 
would continue from one year to another this i refuse 
ultimately france abstained on a paragraph of mondays 
political declaration which welcomed the us proposal for a drug 
task force but without specifying what countries might be members 
mitterrand said his confrontations with reagan on this and other 
issues farm subsidies and aid to the philippines did not 
exceed reasonable bounds 
the dispute over whether to single out the philippines as a 
fragile democracy deserving financial support came tuesday morning 
at the summits final session delaying its conclusion by about an 
hour 
mitterrand said many other countries were in much the same 
position of the philippines which was only singled out for us 
strategic and political reasons 
i spoke of argentina mitterrand said noting that there 
too a government was threatened after replacing a dictatorship and 
was suffering under an economic burden that could menace the 
survival of democracy 
mitterrand who will be the host of next years summit meeting 
said french foreign minister roland dumas suggested the compromise 
that was adopted noting that countries in africa asia and latin 
america deserved help to preserve democracy but naming only the 
philippines 
on farm subsidies where reagan failed to win support for their 
elimination in the next decade mitterrand said it was not a 
franceus confrontation because several european countries joined 
him in opposition 
mitterrand the only socialist in a group of otherwise 
conservative national leaders at the summit said he had spoken up 
to note that his peers who praised effusively the unfettered free 
market were also pleased that international cooperation had 
limited the effects of this false liberty after the october 
market crash 
theres a little contradiction between the hymn to freemarket 
doctrine and what has just happened he said 
mitterrand 71 has attended the last eight summits just as 
reagan has but while reagan prepares to retire mitterrands new 
term runs until 1995 
the french president said he had no objection to the warm praise 
for reagan offered by canadian prime minister brian mulroney at the 
end of the summit 
for someone who played a great role in contemporary history 
its normal to salute him and wish that his retirement be happy and 
long its a courtesy mitterrand said it has nothing to do i 
suppose with politics

michael dukakis presidential campaign is 
conducting public polling to gauge the strength of potential 
democratic vice presidential candidates and has requested 
background information from jesse jackson and at least one other 
contender sources said tuesday 
at the same time sources said paul brountas dukakis close 
friend who is guiding the search for a running mate received 
advice in congress last week to steer clear of jackson who 
finished second in several primaries and caucuses and will have the 
support of more than 1100 delegates at the party convention 
several officials said brountas was advised to balance the 
ticket with a moderate or conservative democrat preferably from 
the south or west 
he was told you can basically write it off in terms of the 
election if you pick jackson said one member of congress who 
attended one of several sessions that dukakis adviser held 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that in 
addition to jackson sen bob graham of florida has been asked to 
supply financial and other background information sen bill 
bradley of new jersey who also has been mentioned frequently as a 
possible running mate has not yet received such a request his 
office said 
brountas met with numerous democrats during his visit to 
washington including sen ernest hollings dsc jacksons lone 
supporter in the senate 
i provided information about everybody else except me 
hollings said thorugh an aide 
in his meetings with congressional democrats brountas was urged 
repeatedly to balance the democratic ticket with someone who can 
attract votes in the south and west said several sources 
including one congressman who attended a session with him 
he was advised to select somebody who has broad appeal and to 
keep himself loose from any commitment for jesse jackson at this 
point said the congressman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
brountas reaction was described as noncommittal 
this congressman and others said brountas also was urged to find 
a running mate who would bring experience on defense issues and 
foreign policy to the ticket 
the focus is on the south and on defense and foreign policy 
areas of expertise that are in short supply on dukakis resume 
said a congressional aide whose boss was one of several senate and 
house members to meet with brountas last week the sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
dukakis campaign officials refused to discuss the search for a 
running mate were in the process of gathering information 
said leslie dach the campaigns communications director dukakis 
has said little on the subject although he has said he wants to 
make up his mind before the week of the democratic national 
convention 
relatively few names have been circulating lately as potential 
running mates for dukakis who has wrapped up enough delegates to 
be assured of a firstballot nomination at the convention next 
month the list includes sens john glenn of ohio sam nunn of 
georgia lloyd bentsen of texas graham and bradley and reps tom 
foley of washington and lee hamilton of indiana 
jackson has been mounting a public campaign in hopes of being 
offered the vice presidential spot but public polls in a number of 
states indicate he would hurt the ticket thus dukakis aides 
generally do not believe that the runnerup in the primary season 
will wind up with the vice presidential nomination 
nor is a woman deemed likely to join the democratic ticket 
unlike 1984 when a concerted campaign by democratic women preceded 
geraldine ferraros selection as walter f mondales running mate 
there has been no such public clamor this year and while brountas 
met with sen barbara mikulski of maryland last week while in 
washington her name has not surfaced as a possible running mate 
nor has any other woman member of congress 
the search for a running mate is beind carried out as quietly as 
possible and campaign officials are working to keep the public 
focus on other issues 
to that end dukakis is undertaking an unusually heavy period of 
postprimary campaign travel in the weeks leading up to the 
convention in hopes of generating newspaper and television stories 
that dwell on something other than the vice presidential search 
and when brountas visited congress last week the campaign 
insisted that aides be banned from meetings a request that helps 
minimize leaks to reporters 
even so sources said that in some of the meetings dukakis 
emissary was urged to look for a moderate or conservative candidate 
who will be able to attract support in the south and the west 
areas of the country where democrats have run poorly in recent 
elections 
in addition he was urged to find a running mate who would 
provide experience in defense and foreign policy issues that would 
compensate for dukakis relative lack of experience in those areas 
dukakis only experience in public service has been as a legislator 
and as governor of massachusetts 
while little information was available on dukakis vice 
presidential polling public surveys that are available provide a 
glimpse of how the selection of a running mate could affect the 
race 
a survey published in florida based on interviews conducted in 
early may reported bush held a lead of 61 percent to 24 percent 
over a hypothetical democratic ticket of dukakis and jackson 
when nunn was listed as democratic vice presidential candidate 
in the survey bushs margin slipped to 46 percent to 39 percent 
when nunn was replaced by floridas homestate sen bob graham 
the democrats had 46 percent support to 44 percent for bush

a los angeles lawyer who specialized in sex 
discrimination cases gloria allred broke an 84yearold sex 
barrier at the friars club tuesday but only after an impromptu 
friars roast by a member comedian henny youngman 
some people bring happiness wherever they go she brings 
happiness whenever she goes youngman grumbled as ms allred a 
member of the beverly hills friars club was admitted for lunch to 
the formerly allmale new york club 
ms allred said she caught a midnight flight from los angeles to 
new york after hearing monday that the us supreme court had 
upheld a new york city law barring sex discrimination by private 
clubs 
it is time to end the exclusionary and discriminatory policy 
of the new york friars club which severely restricts the right of 
women to do business on an equal basis with men she said in a 
news conference outside the midmanhattan club before being 
admitted 
all eyes turned when youngman a member of the club for more 
than 50 years appeared at the door and interrupted ms allreds 
questionandanswer session 
i dont think they ought to butt in in our business the 
comedian said if we want privacy we ought to have privacy 
theres a million clubs in new york why do they want to get in we 
have fun here 
when ms allred tried to argue with him youngman brushed her 
off saying i dont know who you are 
she finally slipped past him and into the club saying nice 
to have met you sir youre entitled to be wrong 
once inside she dined on poached salmon and zucchini and was 
joined by the executive director of the club jean pierre trebot 
it went very well she said afterward i enjoyed the lunch 
very much 
trebot said the decision to admit ms allred was made after the 
supreme court ruling monday he said the clubs board of governors 
will vote on whether to admit women as regular members we expect 
it will be affirmative he said 
the friars club founded in 1904 has 1360 members in new 
york twothirds of whom are active in the performing arts its top 
officer called the abbot is frank sinatra other members include 
george burns and irving berlin 
the friars policy until tuesday was to admit women only after 4 
pm or for lunch on saturdays 
ms allred successfully fought for admission to the beverly 
hills club in may 1987 and had been trying since last fall to be 
admitted to the new york club under a policy of reciprocity between 
the two organizations

the united nations which is on the edge 
of financial ruin is spending 74 million on the special session 
on disarmament that ends this week 
a budget document obtained tuesday by the associated press 
estimates the costs of the fourweek general assembly session at 
417 million a series of preparatory sessions at 267 million 
and un payments for travel by delegates from the poorest nations 
at 556500 
the document dating from november 1986 took estimates of 
inflation into account and provided figures in anticipated 1988 
dollar values 
un spokeswoman nadia younes said specialsession costs are 
paid out of the regular un budget which is about 800 million 
this year she also noted the united nations may not spend all the 
funds allocated for the session 
last friday secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said the 
united nations could close down by late october if member nations 
do not pay the 691 million in overdue membership fees 
the united states has withheld 467 million over several years 
insisting the organization cut its staff and adopt budget reforms 
the ap had requested information on the cost of the session that 
has been attended by delegates from more than 86 of the 159 un 
member nations 
many delegation leaders addressed the assembly and all of the 
groups are presenting position papers and news releases in a 
blizzard of documents 
the largest single budget item for the session is for 
documentation 118 million verbatim records of the sessions 
were estimated to cost 109 million and translations 920000 
preparatory meetings included a twoweek committee session in 
1987 budgeted at 633800 and two committee meetings in 1988 
costing 1074 million and 966000 
the session is scheduled to end saturday with the adoption of 
resolutions on nuclear chemical conventional and spacedbased 
weapons no breakthroughs are expected with the final document to 
be adopted by consensus 
america and most of its western allies are seeking a modest 
resolution dealing with progress in disarmament talks and avoiding 
emphasis on nuclear disarmament 
the soviet union made a sweeping proposal to eliminate all 
nuclear arms by the year 2000 an immediate ban on nuclear weapons 
tests and a multinational naval force under un control 
this is the third special session on disarmament in 10 years 
the previous meetings were in 1978 and 1982

prominent members of the writers 
guild of america broke with the union leadership tuesday and urged 
approval of the latest offer from producers to settle the 16week 
scriptwriters strike 
meanwhile about 40 members of various craft unions picketed 
briefly in front of the writers guild headquarters in west 
hollywood to call for an end to the strike which they said was 
threatening their jobs 
dissident members of the writers guild told a news conference 
they were not antiunion in urging members to endorse the latest 
offer at meetings in new york and los angeles wednesday they said 
they were just trying to save jobs 
we have a responsibility to the greater entertainment 
community to end the strike said bruce paltrow one of the 
creators of the recently canceled st elsewhere series 
this is a decent contract offer a vast improvement over what 
we had and certainly more than we expected to get said peter 
hyams who has written or directed such films as outland 
2010 and the presidio 
the guild responded with a statement of support from other 
notable members including writerproducers michael mann lawrence 
kasdan richard brooks billy wilder and norman lear 
we are opposed to any action that would divide and weaken the 
guild at this difficult time the statement said 
guild executive director brian walton said the dissidents 
attack was a well orchestrated press campaign aimed at 
crippling the 9500member guild 
the guilds negotiating committee and east and west coast boards 
last week recommended that members reject the producers 71 
million contract offer they said the economic package on foreign 
and onehour residuals or reruns was unacceptable 
several of the industrys top hyphenates writerproducers 
who hold union cards but also have become management by starting 
their own production companies are among the dissidents 
they include la law producerwriter steve bochco stephen 
cannell who produces hunter john hughes producer and writer 
of such films as the great outdoors and planes trains and 
automobiles and red dawn writer john milius 
hyams said the producers current offer of a 147 percent 
minimum increase for residuals was a victory for the union 
bochco said continuation of the strike would affect thousands of 
jobs as production dates for the upcoming television season loom 
during the next two weeks 
the day is late and we are beginning to look at the calendar 
if we begin to reduce the number of episodes we can make in a 
season thats when you begin to see tremendous economic loss 
irretrievable loss bochco said 
all of the more than 20 writers who attended the news conference 
insisted their personal interests were not at stake independent 
writers who are trying to sell their scripts and have no other jobs 
in the industry would be most harmed by a prolonged strike they 
said 
cannell who belongs to both the guild and managements alliance 
of motion picture and television producers cited the recent drop 
in syndication sales of onehour tv shows and said both sides must 
realize this business is in fact in desperate trouble 
about 300 members of the dissenting writers coalition met monday 
night and agreed to back the producers offer 
the coalition claims about 600 members which it claims are 
among the guilds most frequently employed members and therefore 
the biggest contributors to its health welfare and pension fund

the government dismissed the president 
of the state oil company petrobras on tuesday the presidential 
palace announced 
ricardo pedreira spokesman for president jose sarney would not 
give the reason for firing ozires silva but sources in the palace 
cited his recent criticism of government economic policy 
particularly a twomonth pay freeze for federal employees 
it was the second dismissal in a few days of a highranking 
official who criticized the wage policy 
late last week sarney fired the armed forces chief of staff 
gen paulo roberto camarinha for criticizing the freeze 
silva was quoted in the newspaper folha de sao paulo on sunday 
as saying of the wage freeze it concerns us a lot it is causing 
real chaos petrobras has 55000 employees 
the measure was part of an austerity plan to help reduce 
inflation and meet the international monetary funds conditions for 
rescheduling brazils 121 billion foreign debt 
while salaries have been frozen for about 2 million federal 
employees the cost of living has risen nearly 40 percent judges

the ordination of women as priests and even 
bishops in the anglican communion need not disrupt the worldwide 
meeting of the churchs bishops next month archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie said tuesday 
i hope that we shall be able to consider living together with 
this degree of impaired communion that exists and i hope we will 
get some idea of how the question is viewed from different parts of 
the communion he said 
runcie spiritual head of the state church of england and leader 
of the worlds 70 million anglicans held a news conference at his 
lambeth palace residence to discuss the lambeth conference that 
meets every 10 years 
he said the 12th conference since 1867 will be attended by more 
than 500 bishops at canterbury from july 17aug 7 
only a minority of the 27 anglican communions in the world have 
ordained women to the priesthood most are in the us episcopalian 
church which is considering consecrating the first woman bishop 
but is expected to wait to see how the debate develops at the 
lambeth conference 
the church of england appears to be moving toward the ordination 
of women and could decide by the mid1990s according to some 
church leaders they noted such a move would have to be approved by 
parliament because it is the state church 
some english bishops have said they would consider accepting 
women priests but not a woman bishop because bishops are regarded 
as the heirs of christs apostles who were men 
bishops at the lambeth conference in 1978 agreed to accept 
churches that ordained women priests and those that did not and 
urged each side to respect the others convictions 
runcie said he hoped next months conference would go beyond 
that decision but he did not spell out what he thought might be 
decided 
other major issues to be considered at the conference are the 
spread of the aids disease relations with other churches and the 
future of the conference 
runcie was asked if the canterbury meeting might be the last 
lambeth conference and he said he had an open mind on whether the 
conference should continue in its present form 
he said there were logistical problems in organizing such a 
large gathering as well as the question of impaired communion 
because of the differences over women priests 
it would not be impossible in the future for a looser 
association of conferences to take place he said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids is a disease in 
which a virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth

west german chancellor helmut kohl said tuesday 
he found general agreement and optimism among the summit leaders 
adding that it would be completely false to call president 
reagan or any other leader a loser over the issue of farm subsidies 
there was broad agreement that the economic policy 
coordination particularly of recent months has proven itself 
particularly effective kohl told reporters 
the coordinated reaction of the summit nations following the 
stock market crash last october contributed greatly to keeping the 
world economy from collapsing he said and the leaders agreed 
that the prospects for the economy are favorable and encouraging 
kohl said 
in short we have wellgrounded cause to look forward with 
optimism and trust he said 
kohl was asked whether europeans had been victorious in fending 
off the attempt by president reagan and canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney to pledge to end agriculture subsidies by the year 
2000 
some journalists love simple formulas and some journalists 
above all love pictures that there are victors and vanquished he 
said that would be a completely false picture 
in the talks on farm policy the leaders had to take account of 
the different situations in each summit country he said 
however he said we are moving completely on a similar 
track 
the longterm goal must be a strong marketorientation of 
agriculture production rather than heavy subsidies kohl said 
for this realism and perspective are necessary 
the leaders must take into account the different size of farming 
operations and in particular protect small family farms he said 
west germany has a number of such small holdings rather than large 
agribusinesses 
of special significance during the summit was the attention paid 
to the debt burden of the worlds poorest countries especially 
those in africa kohl said 
west germany already has forgiven 42 billion marks or 25 
billion in poor countries debt and plans to take further measures 
to ease their burden by another 23 billion marks or 139 billion 
dollars he said 
kohl said he particularly urged environmental protection during 
the summit including a promotion of international attempts to 
reduce acid rain and protect water resources particularly the 
north sea 
he said he would continue to pursue his goal of seeking to tie 
protection of tropical rain forests to helping debtridden 
countries adding that doubtless the world bank has an important 
role to play 
the bank has been criticized for funding projects that destroy 
the forests and the valuable resources they provide the banks 
projects sometimes have included conversions of the forests into 
farms that soon fail and turn to desert 
improvement of the plight of poor countries is also closely tied 
to the fight against trade protection he said 
without open markets the developing countries have no chance 
to improve their situation for the long term he said

the energy department said tuesday it had 
agreed on an unusual tentative settlement of one of its most 
controversial oil price cases a case in which an administration 
official was determined by his boss to have given the appearance of 
a conflict of interest 
the department said anchor gasoline corp a tulsa okla 
refiner and its subsidiary canal refining co of church point 
la had agreed to pay 9 million and possibly as much as 30 
million plus certain interest charges which were not spelled out 
in the announcement to settle charges that the two firms charged 
too much for crude oil and refined products in 19731981 when 
price controls were in effect 
the department still has outstanding about 200 overcharge cases 
president reagan ended controls shortly after he took office in 
1981 
the anchor settlement will go above 9 million if anchors net 
income as defined in the settlement is enough to trigger 
specified shares for the government during the four fiscal years 
beginning may 1 
the agreement calls for the government to take 125 percent of 
net income from 15 million to 2 million and a rising percentage 
of amounts above that reaching 50 percent of anything over 5 
million 
in 1982 joseph wright jr deputy director of the office of 
management and budget called an official of the energy 
departments economic regulatory administration and asked him to 
meet with anchor officials to discuss a settlement a meeting 
occurred 
anchor is run by wrights father the family owned 20 percent of 
the company with wright owning about 3 percent 
though a senate committee explored the matter in 1985 the 
justice department declined to pursue it 
james miller director of the office of management and budget 
wrote wright in 1986 that his call created the appearance of a 
conflict of interest but kept him on the job 
the settlement is open for public comment until july 18 when 
the departments economic regulatory administration will hold a 
public hearing in washington on the proposal

leaders of the seven richest nations concluded 
their annual summit tuesday with a debtrelief plan for the worlds 
most desperately poor countries proclaiming optimism about the 
global economy but spurning president reagans plea to abolish farm 
subsidies 
reagan acknowledged that there are some differences of 
opinion on agricultural subsidies but said i am not going to 
give up on that showing no regrets over the final communique he 
said im just surprised we got it done 
the threeday summit was reagans last and canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney thanked the president on behalf of the 
western leaders 
his leadership has been strong his accomplishments 
substantial and his place in history secure we shall all miss 
his warmth and his wisdom mulroney said after reading the final 
communique 
proclaiming their talks a benefit for the entire world the 
summit leaders agreed to launch a new sevenyear cycle of summits 
in france next year beginning july 14 the bicentennial of the 
start of the french revolution and running three days 
conferring around an octagonal table in a windowless basement 
room of torontos convention center the leaders met for nearly 
three hours an hour longer than scheduled it was a very 
vigorous exchange of views that produced a very substantial 
document said mulroney the host of the summit conference 
members of their delegations had worked through the night to 
finish the final communique completing work on the 34paragraph 
document at 5 am edt 
it contained no surprises or breakthroughs 
at a news conference after the close of the summit reagan said 
he thought the us policy of seeking to ease governmental 
regulation and tax burdens for business has sent a message to the 
rest of the industrialized world and that today it defines the 
consensus of the summit nations on economic strategy 
in a speech tuesday night before leaving toronto reagan told 
an audience of wealthy canadian business executives he hoped the 
industrialized democracies would expand free trade and steer clear 
of the protection and isolation that are relics of another age 
displaying fascination with the technological revolution reagan 
noted that a tiny silicon chip has the same power of the biggest 
computers of the 1960s do we dare stop climbing he asked 
despite the outward appearance of harmony there were some sharp 
differences among the leaders 
french president francois mitterrand at a closing news 
conference accused the united states of trying to transform the 
summit into a permanent body that would try to run the world 
citing reagans call for a sevennation drug task force he 
said in whose name do these seven countries decide for the rest 
of the world 
but he said his confrontations with reagan on this and other 
issues farm subsidies and aid to the philippines did not 
exceed reasonable bounds 
the communique said the leaders approved a plan allowing 
creditor countries to choose from a menu of options in granting 
debt relief to 20 to 30 nations of subsaharan africa 
on the agricultural subsidies issue however they stopped far 
short of reagans proposal to eliminate subsidies by the year 2000 
an idea staunchly opposed by european nations and japan 
instead the leaders said negotiators must develop a framework 
approach to reduce not eliminate the subsidies 
although that was far short of reagans proposal white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was still an improvement from 
the vaguely worded language of the draft communique 
the us is happy with the final product fitzwater said 
a political statement issued monday praised reagan for his arms 
negotiations with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and urged the 
superpowers to pursue deep cuts in their strategic nuclear arsenals 
offering gorbachev an incentive to pursue his programs of 
openness and freedom the summit leaders held out the prospect of 
expanded trade with the west and said that soviet reforms would be 
viewed positively 
reagan stressing his freemarket philosophy had argued that 
upwards of 200 billion a year is spent around the world each year 
to subsidize farm exports however europeans in particular argued 
that it would be unrealistic to eliminate the politically popular 
subsidies 
despite the rebuff on subsidies reagan basically got what he 
wanted from the summit in terms of tougher action against terrorism 
and illegal drug trafficking 
at the urging of reagan the summit statement said the economic 
problems of the phillipines deserve special attention however 
reagan had to compromise with french president francois mitterrand 
who insisted that latin america africa and other pacific nations 
also be mentioned the two leaders grappled at length over the 
issue 
in the final communique the leaders said since we last met 
our economies have kept up the momentum of growth employment has 
continued to expand inflation has been restrained and progress 
has been made toward the correction of major external imbalances 
these encouraging developments are cause for optimism but not 
for complacency the document said to sustain noninflationary 
growth will require a commitment to enhanced cooperation this is a 
key to credibility and confidence 
on third world debt the leaders accepted a compromise put 
forward by canada that permits countries to exercise several 
options for granting debt relief they include extending the time 
period for paying off loans reducing interest rates or actually 
writing off a portion of the loans 
the united states was willing to extend payment periods but was 
opposed to the other two debt relief measures prompting the need 
for the socalled menu approach 
the leaders endorsed the process of closer economic cooperation 
initiated at the tokyo summit in 1986 saying the system was a key 
reason that the world was able to avoid a global economic downturn 
following the shock from last octobers stock market collapse 
developments in the wake of the financial strains last october 
demonstrate the effectivness and resilience of the arrangements 
that have emerged the stateent said 
to further the coordination process summit countries approved 
use of a commodity price index to give them an early warning when 
inflationary pressures are rising the index is a compilation of 
some 40 different commodities including gold 
the communique hailed many of reagans freemarket ideas 
committing the countries to making more progress in deregulating 
their economies it also praised the uscanada free trade 
agreement and the efforts of the 12nation european community to 
remove all trade barriers by the year 1992 
the leaders called on the newly industrial countries south 
korea taiwan hong kong and singapore to do more to lower their 
huge trade surpluses by opening up their markets and allowing their 
currencies to strengthen in value 
and they said efforts should be increased to protect the worlds 
environment declaring more needs to be done to protect endangered 
species and to fight threats posed by global climate changes air 
and water pollution and acid rain

the managers of michael dukakis and jesse 
jacksons democratic presidential campaigns got together tuesday 
but focused more on the election of 28 years ago than the 
differences of their candidates today 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich and her counterpart in 
the jackson camp gerald austin were among the participants in a 
john f kennedy library symposium that examined differences in the 
presidential campaigns of 1960 and 1988 and the medias role in the 
election process 
sponsored by life magazine and moderated by abc correspondent 
jeff greenfield the panel discussion dealt with three issues 
comparing the 1988 and 1960 presidential elections assessing the 
effect of television on the campaigns and an analyzing how the 
nation has changed in those 28 years 
it was a lot of fun for me to sit and listen to the folks from 
1960 said estrich i came away with both a renewed sense of 
appreciation for that campaign and an appreciation of the new 
rules 
one reason estrich and austin didnt spend too much time 
discussing current conflicts was that their bosses were meeting 
facetoface across the country in los angeles 
veterans of the 1960 campaign who were present at the session 
were 1960 republican nominee richard nixons press secretary 
herbert klein and his 1960 campaign director robert finch along 
with kennedys speech writer richard goodwin 
among the topics of discussion was how much kennedys 
catholicism was an issue in the 1960 campaign whereas religion is 
not generally seen as a barrier to political office today 
that suggests how far we have come in the past 28 years 
estrich said 
syndicated columnist mary mcgrory recalled how television played 
a much smaller role in the 1960 campaign which she covered than 
it does today although the televised debates in 1960 were hailed 
as a sign of televisions first significant impact on presidential 
politics 
the panelists also discussed changes in rhetoric and 
speechmaking during campaigns changes they said were largely 
dictated by the demands of television and the evolution of the 
image of the presidency since 1960

jackson tuesday and discussed the democratic vice presidential slot 
but both refused to say whether jackson asked for second billing on 
the ticket 
jackson said they discussed the vice presidency to some 
measure during the 40minute meeting and he repeated his 
assertion that our constituency deserves consideration 
dukakis refused to give any hint of what they discussed 
we talk about lots of things when we talk dukakis said at a 
news conference following the session i dont talk about private 
conversations 
in a separate news conference jackson revealed few details 
we talked about it more than we have talked about it before 
person to person jackson said of the vice presidential question 
dukakis repeated earlier statements that he has begun looking at 
vice presidential nominees but has made no decisions yet 
the process has now begun but its open theres no short 
list or medium list or long list dukakis said 
theres no understanding with jackson dukakis continued 
he himself has said its up to the nominee to make that decision 
i agree with him 
jackson reiterated his contention that he deserves consideration 
as a potential running mate 
this constituency we have organized in our party has earned 
consideration he said our constituency represents hope for 
our party it represents a commitment to make room for all 
democrats 
but asked if he told dukakis that he wanted to be on the ticket 
jackson said im not going to characterize exactly what we 
discussed 
dukakis who now has more than enough to clinch the presidential 
nomination at the democratic national convention in atlanta next 
month met with jackson after addressing more than 3500 members of 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees

citizen in my state dukakis said and i look forward to the 
day i can sign the same kind of bill into law for all americans 
as president of the united states 
dukakis said he would support legislation to require all except 
the smallest businesses to provide health insurance which he 
presented as a fairness issue between employers as well as a basic 
right for employees 
responsible employers who provide insurance for their 
workers must compete with employers who dont provide a dimes 
worth of coverage for their employees and dependents thats not 
fair thats not right and with your help were going to change it 
beginning in january of 1989 he said 
the simplest way and the fairest way and the most affordable 
way to expand the circle of health care and health opportunity for 
our citizens is to require every employer with some exceptions 
for small businesses to provide insurance coverage for their 
workers and dependents he said estimating that about 38 million 
americans would be affected by such a proposal

michael dukakis emerged from a meeting with jesse jackson on 
tuesday and said the process has now begun by which he will 
chose a democratic running mate sources said he had requested 
background information on jackson and at least one other 
possibility sen bob graham of florida 
vice president george bush meanwhile reassured congressional 
republicans worried about his presidential bid 
and president reagan remained unfazed about bushs chances for 
victory in november asked about the prospect that dukakis might 
succeed him reagan said over my live body 
dukakis and jackson met privately for about 40 minutes but 
neither would say whether jackson requested a spot on the ticket 
we talked about it more than we have talked about it before 
person to person jackson said of the vice presidential question 
he reiterated his contention that he should at least be sized up 
as a potential running mate saying this constituency we have 
organized in our party has earned consideration 
dukakis refused to give any hint of what they discussed and 
said no decisions had been made yet on a running mate 
the process has now begun but its open theres no short 
list or medium list or long list dukakis said 
it was the first dukakisjackson session since the two met 
privately for 90 minutes on the eve of the final june 7 primaries 
when dukakis locked up enough delegates to assure his democratic 
presidential nomination 
sources said dukakis has requested background information on 
both jackson and graham and that the dukakis campaign has begun 
public polling to determine who would best help the democratic 
ticket 
some in congress however are advising the dukakis campaign to 
steer clear of jackson sources reported they said paul brountas 
who is guiding the search for a running mate received advice in 
congress last week to look elsewhere 
bush met over lunch with senate republicans who said later they 
told the vice president of their concern about polls showing him 
behind dukakis they offered their help in his behalf like a 
bunch of trout ready to jump out of the water said sen alan 
simpson rwyo 
bush acknowledged he trails but said he was unconcerned i 
read the polls they dont bother me bush said 
im convinced we can carry the day bush told the 46 senate 
republicans i am not going to be outhustled by michael dukakis 
i can guarantee you 
although jackson has mounted a public campaign to pressure the 
vice presidential choice in his favor dukakis aides say it is 
unlikely jackson will wind up in the no 2 spot on the ticket 
brountas met with democratic leaders in congress last week 
sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said he was 
advised privately that the ticket should be balanced with a 
moderate or conservative candidate attractive in the south or west 
dukakis spoke to the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees in los angeles where he called for policies to 
control health costs and provide longterm care for an estimated 8 
million people who need it 
im running for president because i want to make sure that 
quality affordable health care is available to every family and 
citizen in this land he said in prepared remarks 
reagan sought to provide a boost of sorts to his twoterm vice 
president who long ago locked up the gop presidential nomination 
after meeting with foreign leaders at the economic summit in 
toronto 
emerging from the final formal meeting of the last summit of his 
presidency reagan was asked whether he thought dukakis would be 
elected he replied over my live body 
reagan is making plans to spend two days a week campaigning for 
bush this fall aides said 
while consistently trailing dukakis in the polls bush has been 
forced to pinch pennies to stay within federal campaign spending 
limits according to federal reports bush was only 17 million 
away from the 23 million preconvention spending limit as of the 
first of june 
bushs campaign had 3 million in cash on hand 1 million more 
than dukakis had but the democratic nomineetobe reported a good 
month of fundraising and was free to spend 36 million before 
reaching the federal ceiling 
dukakis is keeping up a schedule of campaign trips every week 
laying groundwork for the fall and trying to keep the focus off his 
running mate search 
bush by contrast has been forced to stay close to home to hold 
down expenses and must keep his operation alive with little 
spending before the republican convention begins august 15 the 
democratic convention opens july 18 
the latest indicator of the dukakisbush race a washington post 
survey conducted over five days ending last sunday showed dukakis 
leading nationally by 12 percentage points with a margin of error 
of 3 points either way

british prime minister margaret thatcher on 
tuesday hailed the toronto summit as a success despite the absence 
of agreement on farm subsidies and said the freemarket policies 
pushed there make for a better world 
weve made a start said mrs thatcher defending the vague 
language in the summit communique on farm subsidies and its 
effective rejection of a us proposal to eliminate the subsidies 
by the year 2000 
there is a specific commitment to try first to freeze and then 
to roll back the subsidies and various other kinds of support for 
agriculture in an ordered and substantial way she told a news 
conference at the conclusion of the threeday summit 
it means not just having a higgledypiggledy haphazard 
reduction but really trying to stick to some principles we 
need to set longterm objectives and each have some shortterm 
objective going toward the long term 
she said the sustained economic growth enjoyed by the worlds 
richest countries stemmed from the cooperation and common sense 
of purpose between the summit countries during the 1980s in 
applying sound economic policies containing inflation promoting 
efficiency enterprise and competition 
praising the freemarket policies pushed at the summit mrs 
thatcher said success however hard to come by may not make 
news but it does make for a better world 
mrs thatcher who has been president reagans staunchest 
foreign ally said each and every one of us felt 
wholehearted support and affection for president reagan and what 
he has done 
asked whether she would carry the torch with reagans departure 
mrs thatcher said i just see myself as carrying on believing 
the things that i have believed and trying to translate them into 
action 
this final summit for reagan underlines the success of the 
economic policies we have pursued in this second sevenyear cycle 
of summit meetings in which he played such an important part 
she said the summit also sharpened the attack on terrorism 
by endorsing international civil aviation organization call that 
countries should agree not to allow hijacked aircraft to take off 
mrs thatcher who apologized during the summit to west german 
chancellor helmut kohl for the hooliganism in europe of british 
soccer spectators said she had suggested during the summit that 
discipline was a tougher problem now than adapting to technological 
change 
what we are faced with now are some of the really tricky 
problems some of the behavioral problems said mrs thatcher 
these are the problems that really go to the root of the quality 
of life

japanese prime minister noboru takeshita viewed 
the economic summit with a sense of fulfillment and won praise 
from the western leaders for his countrys success in narrowing its 
trade surpluses an aide said tuesday 
michihiko kunihiro chief cabinet councillor for external 
affairs told reporters that japans three priorities for the 
toronto summit produced results 
he listed them as strengthening policy coordination among the 
seven largest industrial democracies and the european community 
resisting protectionism and addressing the problem of third world 
debt 
i am finishing this summit meeting with a sense of 
fulfillment the official quoted takeshita as saying 
the prime minister was gratified to confirm the importance 
every summiteer attaches to policy coordination he finds that 
sustained growth without inflation has now taken root in the minds 
of every summiteer 
takeshita found it reassuring that other leaders strongly resist 
protectionism while special japanese farming considerations were 
taken into account in calling for reduced farm subsidies kunihiro 
said 
on debt takeshita was particularly pleased that a great 
deal of attention was paid to poor developing countries and 
understood the lack of specific action for middleincome debtors 
such as brazil where the problem is more complex and requires a 
menu approach 
kunihiro said takeshita won complimentary remarks from 
several summit partners for japans recent success in boosting 
imports and narrowing its trade surpluses 
kunihiro said this may have accounted for the absence of any 
japanbashing in toronto in contrast to summits in past years 
statistics talked on our behalf he said

a hearing officer on tuesday 
dismissed a 1000 fine imposed against a woman for allegedly 
violating the states charity law by misusing funds donated for her 
late sons liver transplants 
administrative hearing officer donald alexander in tallahassee 
said in his decision that all the money donated for ronnie 
desillers transplants became part of his estate after his death 
exempting the funds from the state charity law 
as such the circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction to 
ensure that the donated funds which are now a part of ronnies 
estate are used for legitimate purposes alexander wrote 
alexander emphasized that his ruling applied only to whether the 
boys mother maria desillers was required to register as a 
charity he said he was not ruling on whether ms desillers 
received or used the money legitimately 
the decision noted that other court remedies are available for 
those who want to challenge her use of the money 
the 7yearold miami boy died at childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh in april 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant 
after a fundraising drive that brought in 660000 including a 
1000 donation from president reagan 
the dade county state attorneys office is investigating 
allegations that ms desillers made personal use of 47000 of 
donations to her son 
an official appointed by the state attorneys office reported 
last month that ms desillers spent some 200000 of donations on 
herself relatives and friends the spending included payments of 
10850 to a jewelry store and 23700 to ms desillers 
exboyfriend the report said 
ms desillers hailed tuesdays decision 
people should realize i never did anything wrong everything i 
did was for ronnie she said at a news conference 
the state has nothing to show my side of it i will be 
vindicated in the end 
ms desillers lawyer harry robbins said the ruling showed ms 
desillers violated no laws and that the money remaining in the 
estate should belong to her 
we believe that this is the beginning of a vindication 
process said robbins maria only wanted to do good she only 
wants to help people 
robbins acknowledged ms desillers still faces legal problems 
that are likely to continue for years but he said she will 
continue working to increase organ donor awareness 
court documents show 509912 of donations was in ronnies 
account when he died about 239288 remained in a custodial 
account on feb 18

preservation of matagorda island habitat for 
wintering whooping cranes and other endangered species of birds 
entered the home stretch when a senate committee approved 
legislation to buy the last bit of privately held land on the 
barrier island officials said tuesday 
this is important not only for whooping cranes but for water 
fowl shore birds and herons egrets and song birds said brent 
giezentanner manager of the nearby aransas pass national wildlife 
refuge 
a senate appropriations subcommittee late monday approved 
spending 55 million to purchase 5017 acres at the southern tip 
of the texas gulf coast island 
the us fish and wildlife service will buy the land at cost 
from the texas nature conservancy and when the deal goes through 
all the land on the island will be in either federal or state 
ownership according to the office of sen phil gramm rtexas 
but a gramm staffer said it still is unclear how the land will 
be managed with debate centering on whether it should be the state 
or federal government or both the state controls 24893 acres and 
when the final purchase goes through the federal government will 
control 30502 acres 
as the whooping crane flock grows some of the endangered birds 
have wintered on matagorda island rather than at the aransas refuge 
this is going to preserve and protect their habitat from 
development said giezentanner there are only two barrier 
islands in texas that are not developed to some degree matagorda 
and adjacent san jose 
more than 230 species of birds can be found on matagorda island 
including endangered song birds who make the island their first 
landfall upon their northern spring migration from south america 
giezentanner said a total of 20 endangered species of birds use 
the island 
he said 132 whooping cranes wintered last year at the aransas 
refuge or nearby including matagorda island two other members of 
the flock also spent the winter in texas a record high since the 
early 1930s 
the record low was in 1941 when 15 of the birds spent the 
winter in texas and six others in louisiana he said 
of the 134 whooping cranes that left wood buffalo national park 
in the northwest terrorities canada for texas last fall 25 were 
fledged birds those just able to fly and all made the 2500 to 
2800mile journey

agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 saying we have come a 
long way since the issue was placed on the agenda two years ago 
mulroney host of the 14th annual meeting of the worlds largest 
industrialized democracies had hoped that his summit colleagues

summit agenda in tokyo two years ago he said

trade talks 
it is not a perfect statement but it represents some 
progress mulroney said 
the conservative leader said he was gratified that the summit 
strongly welcomed the uscanada free trade agreement which 
has run into heated opposition within canada 
its pretty hard to do better than that he said of the 
communiques language 
most of all mulroney said he was pleased with the success of 
the two additional negotiating sessions he introduced into economic 
summitry including a relaxed talk about educational needs of the 
future

portauprince haiti ap former president leslie manigat 
urged the world tuesday to shun the soldiers who threw him out of 
office but opposition politicians called him an opportunist and 
said they were glad he was gone 
one opposition leader suggested negotiations with lt gen henri 
namphy who proclaimed himself president on monday 
as night fell on a calm capital late tuesday there was concern 
among relatives of some members of the manigat government who were 
arrested during the coup 
we only hope they come back as soon as possible said 
francois savain his father roger savain was information minister 
and francois brother roger jr was a close friend of manigat 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the two savains former information ministry officials rodney 
marcellus and jean narces lescouflair and manigat cabinet chief 
lionel desgranges were arrested the source didnt know whether the 
five remained in custody tuesday 
capt isidor pignon commander of fort dimanche where political 
prisoners are usually taken angrily refused to tell the associated 
press whether the manigat aides were there 
few other people in this impoverished city seemed upset by the 
events that ended manigats 4monthold civilian government and 
brought back namphy who had run the country for two years after 
the duvalier dictatorship ended 
the message is clear haitians have been mocked for too long 
by their governments the people are not concerned because they 
never accepted manigat this has been an affair at the top said 
the rev antoine adrien a liberal roman catholic priest and 
advocate of democracy 
a sociologist who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
manigat by words alone wanted to maintain the illusion of 
democracy one puff of the armys bad breath blew it away 
in washington the state department said the united states would 
maintain relations with the new government and work toward 
democracy through diplomacy not sanctions there is no break in 
the diplomatic relations were not contemplating it spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said 
manigat is in the dominican republic which shares the caribbean 
island of hispaniola with haiti he told reporters he had been 
urging foreign governments and international organizations to 
isolate the military government namphy set up 
my government represented the only and final chance for 
democracy manigat said the other democratic sectors have 
understood that too late and it was their political mistake to 
refuse the public support that would have strengthened my 
government 
manigat a 57yearold former political science professor 
called the new regime very fragile he said the coup was the 
result of corruption in the military 
he said he did not know what role was played in the coup or 
subsequent events by col jeanclaude paul who has been indicted 
on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in miami 
namphy always acted on his own manigat said adding that he 
had faith in paul as a loyal military man 
manigat sided with paul last week by overruling namphys order 
ending the colonels command of the 700man dessalines battalion 
whose barracks is just behind the national palace 
manigat dismissed namphy and confined him to his home but loyal 
officers freed him late sunday 
paul however was at namphys side monday when the 55yearold 
general waved an uzi submachine gun on television and announced his 
military government namphy restored paul to his command and the 
7000man haitian army appears united 
no injuries or deaths have been reported in the coup sporadic 
shooting was heard in portauprince overnight but no casualties 
were reported tuesday gunfire at night is part of a tradition of 
intimidation in haiti 
opposition political leaders boycotted the jan 17 election 
which manigat won with the armys help most expressed the belief 
tuesday that a new chance for democracy might follow his ouster 
in puerto rico where he lives in selfexile louis dejoie ii 
urged a dialogue between namphy and politicians 
the only way to put the country back on track is to have free 
honest elections said dejoie one of four leading presidential 
candidates who refused to enter the jan 17 election manigat was 
not viable nationally or internationally and tried to 
doublecross the army the way he doublecrossed the democratic 
forces 
namphy has no popularity he said i will wait and see 
what the military government offers the people before judging them 
they cant govern forever with bayonets 
haiti the worlds first black republic won independence from 
france in 1804 and has experienced dozens of coups and autocratic 
regimes 
namphy led a militarycivilian junta that ran haiti after 
president jeanclaude duvalier fled feb 7 1986 ending the 
29year dictatorship founded by his father francois papa doc 
duvalier namphy turned the government over to manigat last feb 7 
namphy said he overthrew manigat because the president betrayed 
democracy and the constitution namphy and his army have made clear 
they consider a good civilian government to be one that lets the 
military keep its traditional role as the power behind the throne

game show host pat sajak hoping to send 
cbss latenight ratings wheels spinning with a new talk show says 
the program is still in the formative stages with the biggest 
decision so far being a name 
its going to be called the pat sajak show 
i guess it isnt the most creative thing in the world but it 
says what it is said sajak the lowkey host of wheel of 
fortune the most successful television series in syndication 
history 
of course i had a different idea said sajak i looked up 
and down the cbs schedule and saw kate amp allie cagney amp lacey 
eisenhower amp lutz jake and the fatman so i thought a good 
name would be pat and his desk 
sajak 41 will be the latest to go up against the mighty johnny 
carson in the latenight slot a time when joan rivers and alan 
thicke have failed 
but cbs last in primetime and latenight ratings is betting 
sajaks popularity from wheel of fortune will translate to 
viewers when the show starts in january 
the network has given the pat sajak show a twoyear 
commitment and is building a studio for it in hollywood 
i mean obviously thats what im doing is competing in the 
same time slot with carson said sajak all i can say is im 
going to do a good show and let the pieces fall where they may

a group of atlantic coast indian 
rebels declared they were renewing their warfare against the 
leftist sandinista government said a statement published tuesday 
night in the opposition newspaper la prensa 
the communique of the yatama indian rebel organization rejected 
peace negotiations with the sandinistas and said the government 
would have to revise its dictatorial policies to implant the 
conditions for a true democracy in our country 
the rebel yatama indians seek a form of selfgovernment for the 
indigenous tribes along the socalled mosquito coast of the 
atlantic the sandinistas have reached agreements with other indian 
rebel groups to lay down their arms 
yatama organizers claim to have 2000 combatants at least 1000 
have surrendered since last year and the indian war had stopped for 
the most part along the atlantic 
the statement signed by yatama general coordinator wicliff 
diego said the sandinistas refused to accede to their demands for 
autonomous rule 
in view of this our indigenous organization wants to manifest 
its firm contention to continue the armed fight until we reach a 
democracy that guarantees rights to all the people especially 
indian rights it said 
the armed fight will continue with or without military aid 
there was no immediate response from the government 
ceasefire talks with the indians began in may little more than 
a month after the ussupported mainstream rebels known as 
contras reached a temporary truce with the sandinistas the 
indians received a small part of the millions of dollars in 
military and economic aid supplied by the us government 
the indian fight however is markedly different from the 
contras tens of thousands of miskito rama and sumo indians were 
forced from their tribal lands in 1981 when the sandinistas said 
they uncovered a plan to oust government representatives in the 
junglelike region 
thousands fled tribal homelands across the winding coco river 
into honduras the united nations high commissioner for refugees 
reported that most have returned to the 75mile long atlantic 
seaboard that is their home

youth gangs attacked police with firebombs and stones in downtown 
hamburg tuesday night after the netherlands victory over west 
germany in the european championships 
police spokesman bernd metterhausen said 10 police officers were 
injured and at least 30 people arrested in running clashes that 
continued into the early hours wednesday 
two west german groups including scores of rightwing 
extremists and rival leftists also attacked each other with 
police officers caught in the middle police officials said 
on tuesday afternoon radical west german rightwingers had 
distributed leaflets challenging hamburg leftists to a fight that 
night 
metterhausen said 1000 west german soccer fans and skinheads 
young toughs who shave their heads massed in the reeperbahn a 
downtown area noted for pornographic displays and prostitution 
no dutch fans were involved in the skirmishes he said 
police vans lined the area as 600 officers in riot gear restored 
order 
metterhausen said the violence began shortly before midnight 
tuesday when fans returning from the match began attacking police 
officers 
we were dealing with that incident when a gang of punks who 
live in the harbor area of the city came up to the reeperbahn and 
also joined in he said 
the police were being attacked from both sides they were 
being attacked with stones metal balls launched with catapults 
sticks and even molotov cocktails he added 
several police were hurt and two were taken to hospital after 
being hit on the head by missiles metterhausen said 
eight other officers needed treatment for effects of tear gas 
which the gangs threw at police 
police most in riot helmets and carrying shields stood by as 
the fans and youths gathered in the reeperbahn 
also watching were several hundred dutch fans who were 
celebrating their 21 victory and appeared to be taking no part in 
the violence

a former college football star went on 
trial on firstdegree murder charges tuesday nearly 31 years after 
the man he is accused of slaying was shot to death 
bobby hoppe 53 is charged with the 1957 shotgun death of don 
hudson a 24yearold moonshine runner who had dated hoppes sister 
prosecutor tom evans and defense attorneys bobby lee cook and 
leroy phillips spent more than six hours tuesday in hamilton county 
criminal court selecting a jury opening arguments are scheduled 
wednesday before judge joe dirisio 
hudson an exconvict who had several scrapes with the law was 
shot in the early morning hours of july 20 1957 as he drove his 
car on a street in north chattanooga not far from his home 
hoppe a star running back who went on to help lead a 100 
auburn university team to the 1957 national football championship 
was questioned at the time of the slaying 
however no one was arrested in connection with hudsons death 
until hoppe was indicted last march after police reopened the case 
at the request of hudsons mother georgia 
key prosecution witnesses in the case are expected to be the 
rev joseph godwin a baptist minister who is mayor of mars hill 
nc and odene neal of red bank tenn who was an acquaintance of 
hoppe in 1957 
during a pretrial hearing earlier this month godwin testified 
that he was taking a summer class at auburn in a957 when hoppe came 
to him and said he had killed a man 
defense attorneys argued then that godwins testimony shouldnt 
be allowed because of a 1959 law prohibiting the courtroom use of 
conversations with ministers dirisio ruled that godwin and hoppe 
did not have a pastoral relationship 
mrs neal testified during another pretrial hearing that seven 
hours before hudson was slain hoppe had threatened to kill him she 
said hoppe made the statement after mrs neal told him that hudson 
had smacked around on hoppes sister joan whom hudson had 
dated 
in a successful defense motion monday to get a list of the 
states witnesses cook and phillips described godwins and neals 
testimony as false and manufactured 
hoppe is on an unpaid leave from his job as athletic director at 
chattanooga state technical community college if convicted he 
faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison 
tennessee has a death penalty but hoppe is being tried under 
the law as it existed in 1957

president reagan said tuesday that bribery and 
fraud in the the multibillion dollar purchasing program of the 
pentagon was understandable given the size of the government 
but that he was very upset about the alleged scope of the 
problem 
at a news conference marking the end of his eighth and final 
economic summit reagan also was asked about the drought plaguing 
the united states noting he has set up a task force to look into 
the problem reagan said outside of praying for rain there 
isnt anything i can do until we hear from them 
on another subject he suggested that guncontrol laws should be 
tightened to require that gunholders undergo some training 
after the news conference and a speech to canadian businessmen 
reagan returned home to washington where he was met at the white 
house by chief of staff howard h baker jr 
uncharacteristically reagan did not have a full house of 
reporters for his news conference some correspondents said they 
had difficulty getting through the strict security in the hotel 
where the session was held and the white house staff shuffled 
reporters around to fill up empty seats in front rows 
once again reagan refused to say whether he would pardon oliver 
north or john poindexter for their alleged roles in the irancontra 
scandal however he said the legal case against them has to go 
forward or they would live the rest of their lives under a shadow 
of guilt 
immediately after his opening statement reagan was peppered 
with questions about the investigation of alleged corruption at the 
pentagon 
i think all of us are disappointed and upset that such things 
could happen reagan said nevertheless he said i think it 
should be understandable how such things can happen in something as 
big as our government is 
reagan added but i think we also ought to recognize that 
within our government it brought the units to which we entrust 
such things to launch an investigation 
the president said he did not want to leave the impression the 
problem was minor i dont feel that way at all as a matter of 
fact im very upset im not taking this lightly at all 
however he said it was the pentagon itself that uncovered 
and then proceeded to investigate and pin down where there was 
guilt 
prosecutors this week disclosed a widespread investigation into 
alleged bribery and fraud in the pentagon weapons purchasing 
system and disclosed that it used wiretaps that recorded more than 
4700 telephone conversations as part of the probe 
reagan said caspar weinberger his longtime friend and defense 
secretary for seven years until late in 1987 was one of the 
finest pentagon chiefs ever even though the alleged corruption 
happened on his watch 
he said he didnt think the affair would give democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis a boost in his race against 
republican george bush 
i dont think it really gives him any at all i dont think 
this is a case at high levels reagan said 
when a reporter asked whether a change in his management style 
might have prevented the problem at the pentagon reagan said he 
doubted it you cant be down there watching several million 
people in the total of all of the companies and the defense 
department every day in what theyre doing 
his remarks on gun control were prompted by a question about an 
incident in which columnist carl rowan shot a teenager who was 
trespassing in his swimming pool in the middle of the night 
reagan said that at his ranch in california he taught his 
entire family how to shoot a gun in case they need to 
reagan said he would like to see states adopt a system that 
would require a background check before a person could purchase a 
gun to make sure they dont have a record of any crimes or 
mental problems or anything of that kind 
in addition he said i think maybe there could be some 
restrictions that there had to be a certain amount of training 
taken reagan added 
on other matters 
he said he doubted that record losses in the savings and loan 
industry would add up to a crisis i certainly hope not and i 
dont think so he said although he conceded there is a 
problem there and were trying to deal with it 
launched into a long defense of his handling of the 
irancontra affair reminiscent of his statements in the days and 
weeks immediately after the scandal broke 18 months ago he 
defended his decision to seek ties with moderates in iran and said 
he had worked as best and as quickly as he could to make the facts 
of the diversion of funds to the contra rebels public after he 
found out about it 
we love canada he said in thanking the host nation

the parentteacher group working with local health 
professionals and school personnel conducted a survey to learn 
what students knew about the disease and then arranged inservice 
training for the school staff and coordinated a program for the 
students 
the gainesville educators reported finding that students 
significantly improved their knowledge about how to protect 
themselves against acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
koop noted that of the 65000 reported aids cases in the united 
states since 1981 most involved sexually active male homosexuals 
or intravenous drug abusers who share needles 
but the surgeon general emphasized that the disease will spread 
into a broader population unless parents and educators encourage 
young people to abstain from sex while in school and practice 
monogamy as adults 
if abstinence or monogamy isnt practiced koop said young 
adults must be made aware of the protection afforded by latex 
condoms 
koop implicitly endorsed utahs twotiered aids education 
program 
the program offers one set of lessons for the general school 
population beginning with the third grade and separate more 
detailed lessons for children whose parents request it the program 
is designed to give detailed information without offending a small 
but vocal minority that opposes any sex education 
ive always said you cannot exceed community standards when 
designing an aids curriculum he said otherwise it will never 
fly 
koop said the governments recent educational effort an 
eightpage pamphlet mailed to 107 million american households 
apparently got a favorable reception with the exception of a 
very very few farrightwing protesters 
judging from the number of people whove accosted me in 
airports everyone in the world has read it twice he said

the military coup in haiti will not 
interrupt haitis efforts to regain millions of dollars allegedly 
taken by dictator jeanclaude duvalier when he fled to france 
attorneys representing haiti said tuesday 
a judge was to be selected monday in this southern french city 
to hear the case against duvalier accused of misappropriating 120 
million in public funds 
in haitis capital of portauprince on monday lt gen henri 
namphy reestablished military rule by decree and named his own 
government a few hours after ousting president leslie manigats 
civilian government 
the coup crushed hopes for the democracy promised two years ago 
after duvalier was toppled ending his familys 29year 
dictatorship 
we are not lawyers for the government but for the haitian 
state said attorney yann colin who represents haiti in its 
french legal proceedings 
in april a french court ruled it had jurisdiction in the case 
against duvalier 
the haitian national lottery office of vehicle insurance 
gaming commission and portauprince bank are demanding that 
duvalier and members of his entourage reimburse the government

what duvalier diverted

his wife michelle and other family members in a luxurious mansion 
in southern france rented from saudi millionaire adnan kashoggi 
duvalier has declined to comment on political developments in

china is both a land of opportunity and a 
quagmire of bureaucracy delay and high costs american businessmen 
were told tuesday at a major trade and business conference 
i think china is a super place to do business if you realize 
theres no free lunch william kinch head of grace china 
limited said during panel discussions at the uschina joint 
session on industry trade and economic development 
the conference has brought nearly 1000 american businessmen to 
the great hall of the people for discussions on doing business in 
china 
it is the largest business conference ever held in china and 
reflects chinas hopes that american money will play a major role 
in its modernization drive 
ussino trade topped 10 billion last year 
kinchs company in shanghai produces sealing compounds for cans 
and was one of the first enterprises in china wholly owned by 
foreigners 
he said it took nearly three years of negotiations to establish 
the company because of foreign exchange problems and the need to 
receive approval from several ministries and offices both in 
shanghai and beijing 
attorney jerome cohen a specialist on chinese law told 
potential investors they must be certain they are negotiating with 
people who have the business licenses and authority to sign 
contracts 
he said approval from a ministry for a joint venture does not 
mean that the tax or customs offices will go along with the project 
roy king of hj heinz co which produces baby food in southern 
china said inflation accompanying chinas switch to 
marketdetermined prices is becoming a serious problem and any 
equipment invented in the last 30 years will have to be 
imported 
he said permits and licenses can take months to obtain because 
of the very well developed bureaucracy and joint ventures must 
bring in people at great cost in the early stages because of the 
lack of skilled chinese personnel 
american panelists also said low labor costs are offset by low 
productivity and there is an absence of marketresearch skills 
chinese speakers emphasized the progress china is making yuan 
zhenmin director of treaties and law in the foreign economic 
relations and trade ministry said the government has moved 
aggressively to pass laws governing foreign investments 
yuan said income tax patent jointventure and trademark laws 
passed in recent years have assured foreign businessmen of fair 
treatment china now has more than 10000 joint ventures or wholly 
foreignowned enterprises 
it is the first visit to china for about 95 percent of the 
american businessmen 
ivy joseph breaux operator of a centrifugal foundry in temple 
texas said the chinese are really trying to move very fast i 
really trust them 
the chinese are very sincere said alberto barrocas a shoe 
manufacturer from miami they are very conscious of the great 
need they have for expanding their horizons in trade they want to 
make it happen

president leslie manigat in sundays military coup he said he was 
pulling out venezuelan aid workers sent to haiti after the fall of 
dictator jean claude duvalier in february 1986

unacceptable for venezuela and we are making all the necessary 
consultations to promote collective action by latin america to 
correct this abnormal situation lusinchi told reporters at the 
presidential palace 
while manigat will always be welcome in venezuela it is not a 
question of hospitality but of reestablishing the democratic 
system in this fellow nation he said 
lusinchi said a corps of venezuelan officials and soldiers sent 
to haiti in 1986 to help build roads and housing was recalled 
tuesday as a show of protest he did not disclose the extent of 
the venezuelan assistance 
manigat was granted political asylum in the dominican republic

smuggling charges against four former directors of the countrys 
largest weapons manufacturer 
the bofors ab executives were accused of selling 300 
antiaircraft missiles to bahrain and dubai in 1979 and 1980 in 
violation of swedish export regulations barring arms sales to 
volatile regions 
folke ljungvall chief prosecutor of the city of karlstad said 
he expected the case to come to trial later this year if 
convicted the defendants could face prison terms ranging from six 
months to six years he told the associated press 
those charged after a fouryear investigation were former 
managing directors claesulrik winberg and martin ardbo former 
sales director lennart palsson and hans ekblom who had headed the 
export division 
its not the company thats being prosecuted said bofors 
spokesman per mossberg in todays bofors there have been some 
major changes and the company is now stronger than it was before 
critics have said the allegations of misconduct in arms exports 
have undermined the credibility of swedish neutrality and the 
leadership role that it claims in advocating world disarmament 
ekblom said through his lawyer that the deal in which he was 
accused of illegal practices had been approved by the director of 
the war materials inspectorate rear adm carlfredrik algernon 
algernon was crushed to death by a subway train at stockholms 
central station in january 1987 a week before he was to be 
questioned in the case police said they suspected suicide

a subsidiary of baxter international has 
stopped making two mechanical heart valves and recalled 6000 
unused devices after malfunctions caused six deaths a company 
spokesman said 
valve malfunctions in 12 patients were reported to the us food 
and drug administration and six of the malfunctions were fatal 
walter schneggenburger who heads the fdas santa ana office said 
monday 
the valves had been implanted in 20000 patients most overseas 
and all of the malfunctions occurred overseas the valves were 
approved for sale in the united states only in may 1987 
twelve malfunctions out of 20000 is a very small number but 
it was disturbing enough for us to decide to do the prudent thing 
by halting manufacture of the two models said les jacobson 
spokesman for deerfield illbased baxter the companys 
irvinebased edwards division makes the valves 
doctors have been urged to monitor closely patients who are 
using the valves rather than have them removed schneggenburger 
said 
the recalled mechanical valves were marketed as edwards 
duromedics aortic bileaflet valve model 3160 and mitral bileaflet 
valve model 9120 
the malfunctions occurred when gatelike leaflets regulating 
the flow of blood through the valves broke loose schneggenburger 
said 
the edwards division is one of the leading us manufacturers of 
mechanical heart valve replacements and valves made of organic 
tissue 
the recalled valves are known as carbon bileaflet valves heart 
surgeons have preferred them over other types of mechanical valves 
in recent years with an estimated 90 percent of mechanical valves 
of the carbon bileaflet variety said pieter halter edwards 
former sales and marketing director 
jacobson said the company stopped manufacturing the valves 
shortly after it suspended their marketing may 16 and wont make 
more of them until it can learn why they failed 
the failed valves were made from 1983 through august 1986 by 
hemex scientific which was acquired by baxter in december 1986 
at factories in austin texas and shelkshine scotland 
jacobson said design of the valves was changed after the 
acquisition but it isnt yet know if those valves are less prone 
to failure 
last year edwards carbon bileaflet valves generated 12 
million in sales for baxter a health products company with 6 
billion in annual revenues

socialist president francois mitterrand of 
france who started the decade calling for a rupture with 
capitalism is still out of step with his summit colleagues as

mitterrand and president reagan have both attended the past 
eight summits while reagan prepares for retirement the 
71yearold frenchman has just won reelection to a second 
sevenyear term 
but the fresh mandate does not seem to have given mitterrand 
greater weight with his peers or at least not enough to counteract 
his isolation as the only leftist among the seven heads of state 
and government wrapping up their threeday summit today 
mitterrand has abandoned the radical economic policies of 
198183 his first years in office but still is a long way from 
singing harmony with his conservative colleagues especially

where were you the second week of 1969 
a few baby boomers are bound to suffer mental gaps but try to 
remember on cbs with host charles kuralt refreshes the memory 
thursday with an hour of reminiscence about woodstock apollo 11 
hurricane camille and riots in belfast among other events 
the program is a compilation of archival footage but also 
features presentday interviews with everyday people who 
experienced or were changed by those events a lab worker who was 
quarantined along with the astronauts when she was exposed to 
moondust an episcopal rector who clung to life as his church 
flooded around him two women who were tots when soldiers and guns 
became a way of life in ulster and a member of the first black 
commission in green county ala who was elected that week 
try to remember is a onehour pilot for a possible halfhour 
series 
there are obvious similarities to abcs defunct our world 
the hourlong program of two seasons ago that looked back on 
particular parts of certain years each week linda ellerbee is 
trying to resurrect it on public television 
we just arent trying to do the same thing said executive 
producer shad northshield notably we have kuralt and that 
makes it different we arent resting with explaining what happened 
that week but what happened with individuals nonfamous people 
and how their lives were changed by what happened that week 
try to remember is not a clone if for no other reason than 
kuralt and northshield the team largely responsible for the 
distinctive style of the highly praised cbs sunday morning a 
show like try to remember is perfect for their thoughtful 
eloquence 
for instance one segment of the hour consists of a long silent 
scan of the portion of the vietnam veterans memorial that bears the 
names of the soldiers who died that week 
the highlight for those who remember 1969 as a time of peace 
love and rock n roll is previously unshown footage of janis 
joplin performing at woodstock 
kuralt interviews martin scorsese and his longtime collaborator 
thelma schoonmaker about their documentary woodstock joplins 
set was not included in the movie scorsese said partly because of 
poor lighting but mostly out of agreement with joplins 
management who for vague reasons didnt want it shown it makes 
great tv almost 20 years later 
northshield said the program will concentrate on the 50s 60s 
or 70s the best week is one in which there was someting very 
memorable and famous but only maybe one thing and then the rest 
of the week has a lot of important and interesting things nobody 
remembers he said 
one half hour has already been shot and the staff is hard at 
work researching even though there is no series commitment as yet 
from cbs the network already has three hours of news in prime time 
60 minutes west 57th and 48 hours and is under 
pressure to get out of third place in the ratings 
but the writers guild of america strike in its third month has 
already forced cbs to delay the start of its fall season until 
october so a news show whose writers are not covered by the 
guild might get a lucky break in the fall 
thats our only hope said northshield that socalled 
miniseason that will be in august september october the summer 
is going to last longer than usual even if the strike ended today 
it would be late october before they the entertainment division 
could get anything on 
northshield ideally would like to see the program as a periodic 
shortrun series of eight or 10 episodes 
nbc will begin the tv season with walltowall primetime 
coverage of the summer olympics and abc plans to rerun its 
midseason replacement shows try to remember would not be a bad 
alternative for cbs or its viewers

when your companys sales and earnings are 
soaring whats the problem how to make the good times last 
that is the textbook situation right now confronting micron 
technology of boise idaho a manufacturer of computer memory chips 
in the past few years most american producers of socalled 
dynamic random access memory chips or drams were driven out of 
the business by intense competition from large japanese 
manufacturers 
joseph parkinson microns chairman has described what happened 
then as a hailstorm of illegal selling of products here in the 
us at below their foreignmade cost to produce 
when the united states and japan reached an agreement covering 
international trade in the chips however micron as one of the 
few independent survivors was suddenly in the right place at the 
right time 
with supplies of chips reduced and demand getting stronger all 
the time prices spiraled upward 
after posting large losses in its 1986 and 1987 fiscal years 
micron recently reported a 5465 million profit for the first nine 
months of its fiscal 1988 through june 2 on revenues of 18709 
million 
in the last five fiscal quarters microns revenues have climbed 
from 228 million to 295 million to 432 million to 533 
million to 856 million 
you cant turn things around so drastically without attracting 
the attention of wall street analysts and investors 
microns stock with its ticker symbol dram has made regular 
appearances lately among the most active issues in the 
overthecounter markets national market system from a low of 4 
last year the stock has jumped to as high as 26 this month 
the question facing microns management customers and its 
followers on wall street is what happens to chip prices from here 
on will the shortage persist even as micron adds a new plant next 
year and other bigger companies size up the profits to be made 
expert opinion runs the full range from yes to no one analyst 
queried by the new york times maintained that the shortage will 
last well into 1989 and i think its going to get worse 
said an industry official it will ease toward the end of the 
third quarter and will end in the fourth quarter of this year 
in this kind of volatile uncertain environment micron has just 
disclosed a strategy aimed at increasing the stability of its 
business and enhancing its onceshaky standing 
parkinson the chief executive announced that the company would 
offer to sell chips to customers under longterm contracts that 
couldnt be canceled rather than the shortterm contracts that 
cover most of its sales now 
the move isnt he asserted an attempt to grab the brass ring 
of higher prices while they last but rather an effort to assure 
reasonable prices on the assumption its a longterm 
relationship 
actually wall street analysts who follow the company say 
micron has more on its mind than prices 
in offering contracts to the big names of the hightechnology 
world they say it is trying to improve its position with those 
manufacturers and is turning away to a significant extent from the 
distributors to which it sold most of its chips in the past 
richard whittington and elizabeth dorsey analysts at 
prudentialbache securities called the decision a prudent step 
for what ms dorsey described as basically a oneproduct 
company 
it lessens some of the volatility in their business and 
enhances the likelihood of their longterm success they said

in a curious inconsistency most americans 
approve the slogan separation of church and state but not its 
results 
most favor public prayers before high school sporting events a 
moment of silence in schools for voluntary prayer and inclusion of 
biblical perspectives about creation in discussions of evolution 
majorities also say public schools should allow student 
religious groups to meet in classrooms in off hours and that its 
ok to put christian or jewish holiday symbols on government 
property 
these beliefs along with approval of the separation phrase 
exercised in prohibiting them emerged from a nationwide survey of 
3017 americans 
the telephone survey taken dec 115 1987 for the 
williamsburg charter foundation a private nonprofit 
nonsectarian project in washington dc gauged attitudes on 
religion within politics and public affairs the participants 
chosen at random were 18 and older and the survey had an error 
margin of 24 percentage points either way 
more than 100 prominent americans were to join in a 
reaffirmation of the constitutions religiousfreedom clauses at 
the first liberty summit at williamsburg va on june 25 
the event marks the 200th anniversary of virginias call for the 
first amendments bill of rights 
the survey findings indicated that in this presidential election 
year denominational bias about candidates has dwindled to a 
remnant in contrast to what it was 30 years ago 
only 8 percent of americans would refuse to vote for a roman 
catholic on the basis of religion compared to 25 percent in 1958 
and only 10 percent would refuse to vote for a jew compared to a 
previous 28 percent 
however 70 percent say it is important that the president have 
strong religious beliefs and more than 60 percent say they 
wouldnt vote for an atheist or a homosexual 
only 43 percent however say they wouldnt vote for a candidate 
who has been having other love affairs 
public unfamiliarity with the actual grounding of the volatile 
relationship of religion and government was seen in the survey 
finding that only a third knew freedom of religion was guaranteed 
by the constitutions first amendment 
the phrase separation of church and state appears nowhere in 
the constitution but it is held to be reflected in the amendment 
which actually says 
congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof 
in the survey however 54 percent favor laws against the 
practice of satan worship 
a bigger majority 67 percent of those familiar with the 
american civil liberties union thinks it files too many lawsuits 
regarding religion which often have figured in barring practices 
most respondents approve 
sixtyeight percent think religous groups have a right to get 
involved in politics but 57 percent would prefer they didnt 
recent gallup polls summarized by the princeton religious 
research center find that 68 percent of the public favor a 
constitutional amendment allowing prayer in public schools 
most think only a small percentage of people would be 
offended 
sixtytwo percent think it would be possible to develop school 
courses on ethics and values that would be acceptable to most 
residents of their communities 
as for the professions the public trusts clergymen still top 
the list 
in descending order below come these groups 
druggists doctors dentists college teachers engineers 
policemen bankers tv reporters funeral directors newspaper 
reporters lawyers stockbrokers business executives senators 
building contractors local officeholders congress members

being punished by the vatican was not the kind of 
notice wanted by seattles roman catholic archbishop raymond 
hunthausen but he says it hasnt curbed his message 
and listeners crowd around now to hear it more than before 
probably what i say will attract more attention he said in 
one of his rare interviews since his runin with the vatican 
adding that this makes him somewhat uncomfortable 
at the same time he said he feels that speaking out on 
important issues such as poverty and peace is a responsibility 
that is genuine in my life 
but he said he wants the spotlight on issues not personalities 
i want people to try to catch what im really saying and not 
misinterpret he said 
hunthausen 66 whose full authority was restored a year ago 
after it was curtailed by the vatican for the previous year and a 
half has not backed away from his keen social concerns as a result 
in his responsibilities as a bishop he said i dont feel any 
constraints in what i think i should do and how i should do it if 
im at peace with the direction i feel i ought to pursue i will 
pursue it 
he has kept pushing causes he champions a higher state minimum 
wage lowincome housing and nuclear disarmament he continues to 
withhold a portion of his federal income tax to protest the arms 
race 
he has appeared at protests at the bangor nuclear submarine base 
west of seattle chided state legislators that the 250 hourly 
state minimum wage is an embarassment and criticized seattle 
city leaders for rampant downtown development at the expense of 
lowincome housing 
whenever hunthausen appears at a public event the news media 
are there tourists flock to st james cathedral to hear his 
softspoken but outspoken sermons 
in disciplining him rome claimed he was too flexible about 
granting annulments general absolution for sins intercommunion 
with protestants and letting gay catholics meet in catholic 
churches 
during the time his authority was limited vatican appointee 
bishop donald wuerl had charge of many diocesan functions 
while the clampdown on hunthausen pleased some conservatives it 
also sparked an outcry throughout the united states from priests 
nuns and lay catholics 
on may 26 1987 a special commission of three us bishops 
assessing the situation announced that the vatican had restored 
hunthausens full authority and a coadjutor bishop was being named 
to assist him 
the vatican also transferred wuerl who has since been made head 
of the diocese of pittsburgh 
hunthausen has described the shared powers relationship as 
painful humiliating and confusing but said that he now is at 
peace and believes he and the church are stronger for the 
experience 
since the restoration of his powers hunthausen and his 
coadjutor archbishop thomas murphy have divided up some tasks 
but hunthausen has final authority in all archdiocesan matters 
hunthausen describes himself as a rather shy retiring 
individual he is still clearly reluctant to talk about the past 
situation which he called very painful extremely painful 
while it hasnt shackled his words or actions he said being 
human i suppose that i will never be totally unaware of that 
experience you just cant 
at the same time he said i dont have any regrets about 
statements or actions than led to the controversy he added that he 
does not feel he is being watched by rome 
he has to meet with the threebishop panel one more time and 
then hopefully within a few more months we will see the end of 
that 
he emphasized that any speculation that a deal was made in which 
he would retire soon and murphy would take over is wrong 
theres nothing at all to that absolutely nothing he 
said there was just no deal never any conversation on it it 
never even arose 
hunthausen said hes now in better health than he was a few 
years ago when he suffered a heart attack he also has had prostate 
surgery 
since then hes taken pains to eat better and exercise daily 
including taking hikes in his beloved montana whenever he goes home 
to visit relatives 
i wish i had been doing that all my life because my energy 
level is certainly better on the ski hill than it was he said 
also archdiocesan programs that got started under hunthausen 
such as a reorganization of priests and lay deacons to provide 
adequate service with a diminishing number of priests had to be put 
on hold for a while 
were going to move on now to implement that hunthausen 
said its something we would like to have done many many months 
ago but we were in such a state of flux

zelda rubenstein calls herself a character 
actress a good character actress though not in the same category 
as a meryl streep 
but she is proud of the featured roles shes played 
i can make a lot of people very real i like people and thats 
going to have to show said rubenstein who portrayed tangina 
barrons in poltergeist 
rubenstein who stands 4feet3 continues her role as the 
medium for the haunted little girl carol anne in poltergeist 
iii 
i loved poltergeist iii she said i loved the script 
and i loved the spirit of it 
rubenstein was a latecomer to the film world after a childhood 
that she characterized as relatively normal she earned a bachelor 
of science degree in life science from the university of pittsburgh 
and spent 20 years working in a blood bank and as medical 
technician 
in 1980 she decided to travel 
i did more dishes than i thought were manufactured i worked 
on a shrimp boat rubenstein recalled i survived without 
compromising my standards of morality i learned about having to 
use my wits i got a lot of confidence out of traveling in europe 
rubenstein had long been interested in acting but only after 
traveling did she decide to pursue a career she had pictures taken 
and put together a resume she had three agents within a week and 
in another week she had landed a job as one of the voices of the 
flintstones comedy hour 
when television came i thought that it had tremendous 
potential the power of the medium is enough to exhaust you she 
said communications became more important as i matured i just 
decided i needed to do something creative 
rubenstein broke into movies in 1981 with a supporting role in 
under the rainbow which starred chevy chase and carrie fisher 
and several midgets and dwarfs in 1982 she was cast in 
poltergeist 
i only worked six days on that film i came in i did it i 
observed i didnt ask questions i did my job she said when 
i saw the screening for cast and crew i almost dissolved i 
suddenly realized that those six days had changed my life entirely 
nothing not a single word i had put into the film had been cut 
i realized that i was in the middle of a very big film 
rubenstein has nothing but kind words for the films director 
steven spielberg 
hes divine hes very smart an excellent director very 
companionable if im guilty of doing anything blindly 
rubenstein said in her best stage whisper its loving smart 
men 
like many movie actors rubenstein found herself being 
associated with her onscreen character 
people stopped and asked if i would take a look at their home 
what would i do in this situation she said we have a very 
gullible population i find it totally annoying im a very private 
person 
besides working in film and televison she has appeared on the 
stage and currently is in a washington production of the cherry 
orchard 
after poltergeist became a hit a sequel was inevitable but 
the films producers did not originally have rubenstein in mind 
i got a call indicating i would not be doing poltergeist 
ii she said i wished them well and i cried for about four 
days then they called me to say that the actress was not doing it 
and i could do the role 
i was not happy with poltergeist ii i thought it was 
illconceived 
but rubenstein was not through with tangina barrons in november 
1986 she went to see wanted dead or alive a film directed by 
larry sherman 
there were some shots that were so directorally gorgeous i 
started crying in a movie that didnt warrant tears at that 
point rubenstein said so i made up my mind i would go meet 
the director afterwards if possible 
rubenstein walked into the lobby and spotted sherman standing in 
the middle of a group of people 
i went up to this man and i introduced myself and let him know 
i was just in awe he knew who i was rubenstein said i shook 
his hand and gave him a hug he said he hoped i would be happy 
because we would be working together soon he was directing 
poltergeist iii 
i floated out of the studio

when frank ferrante was 10 he saw his first marx 
brothers movie 
at 11 he dressed up as groucho marx on halloween as a 
teenager ferrante pored over old magazine profiles of groucho and 
watched the movies over and over mimicking the comics 
wisecracking nasal voice 
now the 25yearold ferrante paints on a wide black mustache 
thickens his already bushy eyebrows and masquerades as groucho 
every night in a revival of the marx brothers 1928 musicalcomedy 
animal crackers at boston university theater 
i cant deny the fact that im attached to the man or the 
character ferrante said its pretty overwhelming at times to 
think how important his930s tv quizmaster in 
the 50s and octogenarian in the 70s groucho marx died at age 86 
in 1977 
the show played offbroadway in new york where ferrante won two 
awards for best debut it went to london for six months closing in 
may 1987 and ferrante was nominated for comedy performance of the 
year 
im thinking theres no way i can be groucho marx but i can 
come as close as humanly possible ferrante said in a dressing 
room interview my edge is that i was able to show him as a human 
being no one in the audience knew what he was like so i had to 
create a credible personality 
ferrante has read almost everything written about groucho from 
biographies to theater reviews in the lincoln center archives and 
interviewed his relatives and friends his ear pressed to the 
speaker of an old record player as a youngster in sierra madre 
calif he studied grouchos 1972 carnegie hall comeback 
performance 
youre able to understand his humor by analyzing his early 
childhood the insult humor the defensive humor his attitude 
toward women he said as the years went by i was able to 
unravel this mystery known as groucho marx 
his most bizarre discovery was a 1967 episode of the dating 
game featuring groucho setting up his daughter with one of three 
bachelors in it ferrante saw groucho smile 
you never see groucho marx sincerely smile in any of his films 
or even on his tv show its always a kind of sneer 
i heard him sneeze once he added i practiced his 
sneeze 
arthur marx said ferrante cares about his fathers life and 
doesnt merely imitate the pat mannerisms the cigarchomping the 
bowlegged walk the shifty eyebrows the oneliners 
when frank does it it doesnt look like an impersonator he 
said i dont know any other who has studied my fathers life 
like that he has just lived it 
arthur marx gave ferrante a pair of glasses worn by groucho in 
the movies hats from his private life and the only remaining 
snapshot of a print of groucho in 1923 in the brothers first 
musical ill say she is 
in animal crackers ferrante plays capt jeffrey t 
spaulding the african explorer celebrating his triumphant return 
from an expedition the setting is a long island mansion where 
high society is a vehicle for the antics of groucho harpo chico 
and zeppo 
like groucho ferrante ad libs freely goading the audience when 
a joke flops or a piece of stage business is bungled the voice 
seems a little higher but the movements appear identical 
the character is great he said one second hes playing 
mock coy one second hes aggressive hes constantly vacillating 
its not as simple as it seems 
the huntington theater company production is only the second 
revival of animal crackers the first was in 1982 in 
washington after closing here july 2 the show goes on to atlanta 
ferrante hopes broadway will follow 
ferrante who resembles a young groucho met the comedian my 
idol my hero at a los angeles booksigning in 1976 
he was very slowmoving he had had a stroke and it was just 
shocking to see him i expected to see the groucho marx of duck 
soup he was just so old yet the wit was still there he was up 
there answering questions it left an impact on me

pessimism in the wake of last weeks opec 
meeting continued to wash over the energy futures market sending 
oil prices skidding lower

monday to close at 16 a barrel 
john azarow a trader with shearson lehman hutton inc said wti

the july contract was due to expire tuesday and this 
contributed to the sharpness of the decline said jim fiedler a

among refined products traded on the exchange home heating oil 
fell 046 cent a gallon to 4318 cents and unleaded regular 
gasoline slipped 050 cent to 4947 cents a gallon 
there was no new news to drive prices lower fiedler said 
its just a continuation of pessimism in the 
fiedler said the market was pressured by liquidation of long 
positions contracts bought in speculation of a price rise taken 
ahead of last weeks meeting of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
the opec ministers unable to reach a new agreement that would 
have limited production and raised the price of oil extended their 
current accord for another six months this was bad news for the 
oil market because the cartel already exceeds the selfimposed 
quotas contained in the agreement 
reports that saudi arabia was discounting the price of its crude 
deepened the markets pessimism on monday azarow said

japanese consumer leaders contend lax government 
enforcement of auto safety standards has allowed the sale of 
thousands of unsafe vehicles in japan including the suzuki 
samurai which also has come under fire in the united states 
consumer leaders here say suzuki motor co ltd continued 
selling the sportutility vehicle even though it knew for at least 
a year that the car was prone to roll over 
similar contentions about the rollover danger vehemently 
denied by suzuki have been leveled by the consumers union a us 
private consumer product testing group that has called for the 
banning of the vehicle 
in japan the transport ministry almost entirely relies on 
each manufacturers voluntary compliance with the safety 
standard said fumio matsuda a consumer activist who heads the 
japan automobile users union 
the japanese companies usually adhere to the ministrys 
requirements faithfully but if an unsafe car gets sold by mistake 
or negligence japan has no way to control it because the transport 
ministry has no adequate regulatory system matsuda said 
matsuda blamed the interdependent relationship between the 
government and corporations which often is perceived as an 
advantage for japanese companies over foreign competitors for 
leading to dangerous conditions 
matsuda said suzuki ignored his complaints for more than a year 
after he contended the cars were vulnerable to rolling over during 
sudden turns 
i pointed out to company officials last year that the cars 
high center of gravity and the narrow width can make the car 
unstable matsuda said but they told me they were aware of the 
problem apparently they were not taking the matter seriously 
although the japanese government does not keep statistics a 
number of accidents involving the car have been reported in japan 
since manufacturing began in 1970 according to newspaper reports 
since 1981 when production of the current model began the company 
has sold 120000 of the vehicles in japan 
the samurai sold in japan as the jimny originally was 
designed for a 360 cubiccentimeter engine the model exported to 
the united states has a 1300 cubiccentimeter engine an upgraded 
version which the company started producing in 1984 
upgrading the size of an engine requires larger tires which 
will inevitably lift the center of gravity of the car said 
matsuda who is a mechanical engineering specialist and with a 
stronger horsepower the upgraded model requires a more stable 
structure they should have gone back to the designing stage and 
restructured the car from scratch but the 1300cc model is only a 
enlarged model of the smaller one 
american suzuki motor corp suzukis us subsidiary 
vigorously has defended the safety of the samurai and attacked the 
credibility of the consumers union testing the samurai has a lower 
rate of rollovers than several other sportutility vehicles the 
company says 
analysts and engineers have asked the transport ministry to 
review its safety regulations and enforcement before the japanese 
auto industry suffers severe damage to its reputation in overseas 
markets 
if the transport ministry does not change its loose attitide 
there will be more cases similar to the suzuki overseas said 
yoshiro hoshino a professor at teikyo university who follows 
automobile safety issues unlike in japan traffic accidents are 
strictly investigated in the united states and any safety defects 
will be a target of legal action 
the transport ministry recently said it would recall the vehicle 
in japan only if suzuki decided to recall it in the united states 
japanese automobile companies have been so imageconscious in 
the past decade that the transport ministry really did not need to 
worry about the quality or safety standards of automobiles made by 
japanese manufacturers said hoshino who specializes in 
mechanical engineering 
but as a result the transport ministry failed to develop an 
adequate checking function for the safety of automobiles 
but transport ministry officials say the current system works 
well 
japanese manufacturers are fully aware of our safety standards 
and strictly comply with them i dont think japans safety 
standard is at all inferior to that of the united states and 
european countries said the ministrys masayuki shima 
hoshino and matsuda said the core of the problem lies in 
enforcement not in the standards shima acknowledged the ministry 
did not conduct a maneuvering safety test with the samurai because 
based on data submitted by the company it did not believe the test 
was necessary 
hoshino said an excessive confidence in quality may be making 
japanese manufacturers arrogant 
i am beginning to sense that japanese makers often think their 
products could not be defective because they are so confident in 
their quality control he said and it is resulting in their 
unwillingness to check the vehicles safety

suzuki samurai dealers say sales of the popular sport vehicle 
are showing early signs of a comeback from the damage done by 
assertions that it rolls over too easily 
in an associated press survey the nations top 10 dealers 
predicted their june sales would be off by as little as a tenth to 
more than half because of the critical june 2 report by consumers 
union 
for the first three or four days we had just literally no 
traffic said john alexander general sales manager of mcdavid 
suzuki in houston the nations no10 dealer but time is 
helping time is the big healer 
separately consumers union said monday that it received a june 
11 letter from american suzuki motor corp demanding a retraction 
of its report but rejected it writing back that its report was 
wholly fair and accurate and based upon properly conducted 
tests 
dealers contend the people who still are buying samurais are 
skeptical of the consumers union report and are confident the 
sportutility vehicle is safe as long as it is driven sensibly 
believe it or not its beginning to turn around already 
said mickey rhines a salesman for the nations no1 suzuki 
dealership earnhardt suzuki in tempe ariz 
consumers union gave the samurai its first not acceptable 
rating for a vehicle in 10 years after concluding the samurais 
high center of gravity and light weight gave the vehicle a 
hazardous propensity to roll over if a driver swerved to avoid an 
accident 
american suzuki claims consumers union the mount vernon 
nybased publisher of consumer reports magazine used biased 
and completely inaccurate procedures in its tests which were 
widely publicized 
dealer estimates of the publicitys damage ranged widely and it 
was not possible to verify their statements independently 
the top 10 accounted for 12 percent of all sales this year 
through may by the companys 206 us dealers 
american suzuki motor says it would have no statement until july 
6 about its june sales of the samurai its only car sold in the 
united states 
the dealers response has ranged from the cautious some cut 
back on advertising to the lighthearted 
in the atlanta suburb of marietta ga mark singleton suzuki 
put up a sign saying stop by youll flip over our deals the 
word flip was upside down 
the georgia dealership ranked no5 also went ahead with plans 
made before the consumers union report for a bikini beach party 
featuring swimsuitclad women and a pair of suzukis parked on top 
of a huge sandpile 
crabtree suzuki of new rochelle ny not one of the top 10 
ran fullpage newspaper ads featuring contented customers saying 
why they liked the samurai an example its so easy to handle 
just like my monthly payments 
american suzuki provided dealers with video cassettes of 
samurais successfully handling obstacle courses at high speeds as 
well as information about the vehicles safety record 
dealers said customers who came to the showrooms were willing to 
be convinced 
people are getting tired of consumers union telling them they 
cant ride threewheelers and they cant ride quadrunners said 
mark muller the general manager of ninthranked john chezik suzuki 
in the st louis suburb of st charles mo 
we tell them hey you dont drive it like a sports car 
said richard mcghee general manager of suzuki northeast in 
columbus ohio the no3 dealer 
if you go out and drive the vehicle like an idiot well then 
of course youre going to have idiotic results said earnhardts 
rhines 
threewheelers and quadrunners are allterrain vehicles that 
have been criticized for their instability and consumers union has 
said consumers should be offered full refunds on returns of them 
muller said he may have a nearrecord month for profit in june 
because he saved thousands of dollars by halting advertising 
the people that would be the most concerned with this would be 
uneducated thats not our market to start with said jim 
hardison assistant sales manager of beaman suzuki in nashville 
tenn the no6 dealer 
the educated buyer will not only read the consumers union 
report but theyll read other reports as well such as favorable 
reviews in the auto magazines said keith hugger sales manager of 
bell suzuki in rahway nj the no4 dealer 
i dont have any second thoughts at all about selling this 
vehicle hugger said

a major defeat in his battle to force a buyout 
of texaco inc wont necessarily cost carl c icahn a profitable 
campaign should he decide to sell his stake in the oil giant 
icahn texacos biggest shareholder is mulling whether to 
continue his attempts to force a buyout of texaco in the wake of 
his defeat in a critical proxy battle for five seats on the 
companys board of directors 
whatever his strategy the corporate raider wont walk away 
crying analysts estimate icahn could reap upwards of 450 million 
in profit if he sells his 149 percent stake in texaco to a third 
party 
icahn conceded monday that he lost the proxy battle after the 
new york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co revealed it 
voted its 12 million shares a 49 percent stake in favor of 
texaco management 
saying he considered the kohlberg kravis stake the crucial 
swing vote in the contest icahn said the closeness of the 
race was indeed gratifying i am of course sorry that i did not 
win but so be it 
several large institutional investors had said previously that 
they also voted in favor of management 
it will take several weeks to actually sort out and count the 
votes cast in the proxy fight 
a texaco spokesman said only that the company was gratified 
that kohlberg kravis has voted in favor of management 
icahn texacos largest shareholder sought the board seats as a 
lever to pressure texaco management into letting shareholders vote 
on his proposal to buy the company for 60 a share a bid that 
values the company at 146 billion 
spokesman neil call said icahn now is mulling whether to hold 
the shares sell go for a hostile offer or look for a partner 
icahn previously had said he would sell his shares if he lost 
the proxy battle but in the days before the annual meeting hinted 
he might launch a hostile tender offer for texaco 
the balls in texacos court if they want a discussion 
call said 
analysts said a thirdparty sale would be a logical scenario 
hell make at least 450 million in profits by selling the 
stock so dont feel sorry for mr icahn said bruce lazier an 
analyst at prescott ball amp turben inc he based his calculations 
on icahns having paid about 35 a share for his stake and a 
theoretical sale at about 50 a share 
when considering icahns rate of return he didnt do badly at 
all said paul ting an analyst at oppenheimer amp co the stock 
would have to fall very very low before he starts losing money 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange texaco fell 
112 a share to close at 4687 following fridays drop of 
150 a share it was the most actively traded issue with more 
than 26 million shares changing hands 
analysts believe icahn was unable to muster enough institutional 
support because of widespread skepticism about his ability to 
finance the deal furthermore investors typically resist voting 
against management particularly when a major reorganization is in 
progress 
texaco management also skillfully drove home its restructuring 
efforts by announcing on the eve of its annual meeting a 128 
billion deal to sell 50 percent of its refining and marketing 
operations in 23 states to saudi arabia 
kohlberg kravis said in a statement that it backed texaco 
because it was impressed by the restructuring so far 
the keystone of texacos restructuring plan was a 3 billion 
payment to pennzoil co to settle a lawsuit resulting from texacos 
1984 acquisition of getty oil co after pennzoil had made earlier 
moves to acquire getty 
in addition texaco has begun selling off up to 5 billion worth 
of marginally profitable assets and a 17 billion distribution to 
shareholders also is planned 
kohlberg kravis sold its 49 percent stake in texaco before the 
meeting but retained its voting rights because it owned its shares 
on record date for the shareholder vote 
a spokesman said the firm remained interested in texacos 
progress and hopes to maintain an ongoing dialogue with texaco

the easing of japanese import restrictions 
on citrus provides the florida industry with virtually a new market 
for fresh oranges and orange juice shipments officials say 
we have the potential for similar growth in orange and orange 
juice that we have had with grapefruit said lee bouldin 
international marketing director for the florida department of 
citrus 
florida grapefruit exports to japan doubled in the past two 
years following the removal of import quotas on that fruit and 
bouldin foresees the possibility of equally good results with fresh 
oranges and orange juice once the quotas are eliminated for those 
two products 
the trade agreement announced monday in tokyo by us trade 
representative clayton yeutter calls for a phasing out of import 
quotas for oranges by 1991 and for orange juice by 1992 tariffs on 
fresh grapefruit will be reduced over the next two years 
its clearly beneficiala positive step forward for the 
florida industry said robert behr director of economic research 
for the citrus department 
if floridas share of the japanese market remains the same we 
can expect almost a fivefold increase in sales of orange juice to 
the japanese said behr 
floridas biggest competitor on the world market is brazil 
japan is floridas largest export market for fresh grapefruit 
and lowering tariffs will help any potential oversupply behr said 
florida has a bumper grapefruit crop this year and expects 
record harvests into the 1990s 
the us agriculture department said total american citrus sales 
to japan could increase from 50 million to 150 a million a year 
when the quotas are lifted yeutter said the agreement could double 
us exports of beef and oranges to more than 1 billion annually 
american exports of fresh grapefruit to japan totaled almost 90 
million from january through november 1987 with most of that 
coming from florida behr said this compared with 74 million for 
all of 1986 
for the current season florida growers have shipped 11390000 
cartons equalling about 42 pounds each of fresh grapefruit to 
japan bouldin said this compared with just under 9 million 
cartons in the 198687 season and 6 million in the 198586 season 
executive vice president bobby f mckown of florida citrus 
mutual said the agreement is beneficial in the shortterm and the 
longterm 
florida citrus mutual which is the states largest grower 
cooperative and other state citrus groups helped pressure japan by 
filing a complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
charging japanese orange and orange juice quotas were illegal under 
the international trading system 
mckown estimated that because of the agreement frozen 
concentrate orange juice sales to japan could go as high as 80 
million gallons a year floridas total annual juice shipments 
domestic and foreign now are about 210 million gallons

the economic summit torn between us ambitions 
and the caution of the west europeans and japan bogged down monday 
over president reagans call for an end to agriculture subsidies by 
the year 2000 
the situation is delicate the discussions are very intense 
a senior canadian official said as negotiators searched late into 
the night for a compromise between what he termed extreme 
positions 
there may be the possibility of movement and there may not 
the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
negotiators for the seven industrialized democracies and the 
european community sought a formula to accommodate conflicting 
stances in advance of crucial general agreement on tariffs and 
trade gatt talks in december in montreal 
the declaration on farm subsidies which ranked with third world 
debt as a major economic issue at the threeday gathering was 
expected to be included in the final communique that will be 
released tuesday afternoon 
west german sources said the communique would contain no 
reference to the united states plan for the elimnation of all 
subsidies by the year 2000 
a canadian official said the officials faced a long night 
working on the farm subsidy draft after the europeans stuck to 
their position that the subsidies must be curtailed but cannot be 
eliminated 
it is totally unrealistic british chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson said of the us plan 
i think that it scares farmers in most parts of the world 
unnecessarily if you do talk in terms of abolishing all government 
support all subsidies by the year 2000 lawson added in a 
television interview 
on the other hand we have got to have some form of 
multilateral disarmament on this issue 
british officials said prime minister margaret thatcher during 
an hourlong closed session on the subsidy issue urged the united 
states and canada to give the 12nation european economic community 
credit for its moves since 1984 to cut subsidies 
at a special meeting last spring the eec instituted a system of 
automatic subsidy cutoffs if farmers exceeded their production 
quotas 
but the west european agriculture remains heavily subsidized 
the farm program consumes twothirds of the eecs budget 
eec president jacques delors urged the leaders during mondays 
session to implement past pledges to curtail subsidies rather than 
endorse the us plan 
there is a limit to what you can ask farmers to do delors 
spokeswoman francoise le bail said monday evening 
according to figures produced by the 24nation organization for 
economic cooperation and development japan provided a 75 percent 
subsidy for its agriculture in 1986 compared with 54 percent in 
1980 european economic community subsidies totaled 49 percent in 
1986 up from from 36 percent in 1980 us subsidies were 35 
percent in 1986 up from 15 percent in 1980 
britain france italy and west germany the four european 
nations taking part in the summit are all members of the eec

allegheny international incs dissident 
shareholders say they are confident of winning a crucial proxy 
battle for control of the troubled companys board of directors 
the group led by the new york investment firm spear leeds amp 
kellogg is seeking seven seats on allegheny internationals 
13member board in order to oust chairman oliver s travers and 
push an alternate chapter 11 reorganization plan 
results of mondays vote are expected to be released july 5 
allegheny international said 
the dissident group complained monday that the managements 
proposed reorganization plan could dilute their holdings by 75 
percent 
martin whitman a new york adviser to spear leeds amp kellogg 
said his preliminary plan would infuse 50 million from outside 
sources pay holders of the companys public debt more than market 
value on their investments and exceed managements plan for 
shareholder equity 
but management defended its reorganization plan which was filed 
monday in us bankruptcy court 
when you look at companies that go through the reorganization 
process dilution is almost always a factor travers said 
management of the consumer products company recently told 
shareholders that bennett lebow the investor spear leeds amp 
kellogg recruited to help produce a competing plan diluted 
shareholders equity by 80 percent in his reorganization of western 
union co 
the management plan would leave current common shareholders with 
a 25 percent interest in the company if approved by shareholders 
and the court full payment would go to unsecured creditors in the 
sunbeam corp sunbeam holdings inc and almetlawnlite 
subsidiaries 
the parent companys secured bank creditors led by mellon bank 
would received full payment in cash other creditors would get 
cash notes based on contingent asset sales and common stock 
among current shareholders those with common shares would end 
up with 9 percent of the company holders of 219 preference 
shares would have 5 percent and holders of 1125 preferred shares 
would have 11 percent 
travers meamwhile told the shareholders the company plans 
legal action if necessary to recover 32 million in loans made at 2 
percent interest during the early 1980s 
he said the investment bankers at smith barney appraised 
allegheny international at 663 million

venture by the early 1990s 
the cars are on display at the automakers teamwork and 
technology exhibit which ends today in warren 
the exhibit kicked off a national tour in new york in january 
and has traveled to chicago los angeles dallas and atlanta its 
last scheduled stop will be in toronto later this month 
a senior gm official who asked not to be identified told the 
detroit free press in todays editions that the concept car 
announcement is unusual because most of those cars never go beyond 
the prototype stage 
our goal when we went into this was not to build a car that 
was so farfetched that we wouldnt be able to actually build 
one said marietta kerney gm senior creative designer were 
looking now at building a car thats very very close to what 
youre seeing right out here 
the concept cars were developed last year in an effort to dispel 
criticism that many gm cars look alike and establish distinct 
differences in the automakers marketing divisions said stan 
wilen executive designer for gms chevroletpontiac canada group

consumer prices led by large increases for gasoline and 
automobiles climbed a moderate 03 percent in may the labor 
department said today 
the increase followed gains of 05 percent in march and 04 
percent in april and would amount to an annual inflation rate of 
42 percent if prices climbed at the same pace for 12 months the 
government said 
for the first five months of 1988 retail prices were rising at 
an annual rate of 44 percent the same pace as in 1987 
there was no evidence that effects of the midwestern drought 
reached consumers in may grocery prices rose just 04 percent 
compared with a 06 percent increase in april 
but on monday commodities prices were pressured still higher by 
the merciless drought 
grain and soybean futures prices jumped sharply higher on the 
chicago board of trade except for wheat all grain and soybean 
futures shot up their daily allowable limits at the opening bell 
wheat futures were influenced less by the drought than were 
corn oats and soybeans because the winter wheat crop which 
accounts for 75 percent of us production is nearly finished 
growing and is being harvested 
after the close of trading the national weather service issued 
a sixto10day forecast predicting abovenormal temperatures and 
belownormal rainfall for the grain belt in the first five days of 
next week 
the stock market followed its busiest day of the year friday 
with one of its slowest amid fears of higher inflation due to the 
drought and of rising interest rates 
stock prices weakened as volume on the new york stock exchange 
dropped to 11675 million shares the slowest since may 23 it was 
about onethird the volume of the years record high of 34392 
million shares traded friday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials finished at 208393 
down 2009 broader market indicators also fell 
elsewhere bond prices were nearly unchanged from friday the 
dollar strengthened against most currenices and gold prices fell 
slightly 
in tokyo the united states and japan announced a trade 
agreement that could double us exports of beef and oranges to 
more than 1 billion a year 
my judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark 
agreement in usjapan economic relations us trade 
representative clayton yeutter said monday following marathon talks 
with japanese leaders 
the agreement calls for japan to nearly double its imports of 
beef by 1991 and phase out involvement by the livestock industry 
promotion corp which currently controls most beef imports japan 
would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991 60 percent 
in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow japanese farmers time to 
adjust 
japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22000 
tons annually to 192000 tons in 1990 after that fresh oranges 
from the united states would be permitted in unlimited quantities 
at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent 
off season quotas on orange juice also will be phased out

european economic community have adopted emergency measures aimed 
at improving air safety before the summer travel rush officials 
said tuesday 
the ministers agreed to set up a red alert telephone link 
among europes five busiest airports london frankfurt paris 
rome and madrid 
in addition a crisis center coordinating all west european air 
traffic during the four or five busiest weekends of the summer is 
to be established 
the ministers were told during their meeting monday that several 
potentially serious air mishaps were narrowly averted in britain 
spain and greece over the past few months because of overcrowded 
skies 
proposals for more radical safety measures are to be considered 
in october when the eec transportation ministers meet again 
the ministers decisions were based on a report by civil 
aviation directors in the 12 eec countries that said air control 
services were understaffed and illequipped 
the report also called for linking the data banks of all of 
europes air control centers harmonizing computers and radars and 
opening more of europes military air space to civil aviation

honda motor co says it intends to develop a car 
that would be sold exclusively in the united states 
nobuhiko kawamoto president of honda rampd co the companys 
research division said such plans represent a departure from the 
companys worldwide philosophy 
in the past honda cars have been designed in japan and sold 
throughout the world with few modifications 
kawamoto also said during a news conference monday that honda 
will remain in the subcompact car market despite shrinking profits 
and increased competition from developing nations such as south 
korea taiwan and brazil 
to remain competitive in this market honda will experiment with 
several costsaving measures including increasing automation at 
its new assembly plant at marysville ohio kawamoto said 
the appreciation of the japanese yen which has doubled in value 
against the dollar over the last three years is resulting in an 
expansion of research and engineering facilities in the united 
states kawamoto said 
while honda has no timetable for production of the totally 
american car kawamoto said it would begin in the near future 
as far as complete development i think it will take time

of the company 
a dramatic and lengthy battle for control of societe generale 
ended in april with a narrow victory for a group led by the french 
company cie financiere de suez over italian financier carlo de 
benedetti who had started the fight

consumer prices climbed a modest 03 percent 
in may the government said today easing fears of inflation and 
indicating that the drought plaguing the farm belt has yet to reach 
grocery store shelves 
the may increase less than the gains of 05 percent in march 
and 04 percent in april would amount to an annual inflation rate 
of 42 percent if prices climbed at the same pace for 12 months 
the labor department said 
food prices prices rose just 04 percent compared with a 06 
percent increase in april analysts said the only area where the 
effects of the drought showed up were in higher retail prices for 
vegetable oil and mayonnaise 
the biggest price increase was for gasoline up 17 percent 
after a 11 percent increase in april gasoline prices however 
are still just 29 percent higher than they were a year ago 
automobile prices rose 02 percent last month with the paring of 
many dealer incentives 
stock prices opened higher today on the new york stock exchange 
an hour after the inflation report was issued the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 20 points in slow 
trading monday as analysts had anticipated a larger increase in the 
consumer price index 
it was pretty low compared to expectations john hagens an 
analyst for the wefa group an economic consulting firm in bala 
cynwyd pa said of the price report the food picture hasnt 
really passed into the cpi yet 
for the first five months of 1988 overall retail prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 44 percent the same pace they grew in 
1987 the government said 
treasury secretary james a baker iii said last week that the 
reagan administration remains optimistic that its targeted 
inflation cap of 45 percent for 1988 will not be exceeded 
however low unemploymentspurred wage gains that have been 
outpacing price increases over the last three months plus 
anticipated future food price hikes from the current drought in the 
farm belt have triggered fears of a inflationary wageprice spiral 
later this year or in early 1989 
leading the food price increases were gains for meats poultry 
fish and eggs up 08 percent last month compared with a 14 
percent rise in april price increases for fruits and vegetables 
also slowed from their 14 percent rise in april to 06 percent in 
may 
the increases for other food and beverages were onehalf of 1 
percent or less 
the drought and major hikes in commodity prices that were 
seeing are scary but its just too soon for them to have reached 
the retail market said sandra shaber an economist for the 
futures group a washington consulting firm 
donald ratajczak an economist who directs his own survey of 
wholesale and retail prices from georgia state university in 
atlanta said poultry was a key ingredient in higher consumer food 
prices last month 
the poultry producers may be responding to higher feed costs 
but they are the result more of large us soy meal sales to the 
soviet union last fall than the drought he said 
about the only place where the 1988 drought could have reached 
the retail level so far ratajczak said is in the prices of 
vegetable oil and mayonnaise those prices rose 08 percent in may 
but account for only onefourth of 1 percent of the consumer price 
index 
medical costs jumped 07 percent in may and are now 64 percent 
higher than they were a year ago making them the single biggest 
propellant of inflation in the consumer price index 
but prices for womens clothing which had skyrocketed a total 
of 7 percent in march and april fell by 04 percent last month 
apparel prices have softened and the large increases there are 
over said ms shaber theres a lot of stiff consumer 
resistance out there retailers already have put the stuff on 
sale 
the 03 percent increase in the overall index in may was the 
smallest since a 02 percent rise in february 
the may figures raised the index to 1175 meaning that a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during a 198284 base 
period would have cost 11750 last month a dime more than in 
april 
while severe inflation has yet to rear its head analysts expect 
a combination of droughtrelated commodity shortages and decadelow 
unemployment to push prices up faster in 1989 
hourly wage increases for example have outpaced price 
inflation the last two months after lagging way behind for more 
than a year 
to some like ms shaber the wage increases can only be 
expected at some point to catch up with price inflation but to 
other analysts particularly those with close ties to the financial 
markets the prospect is scary 
were definitely getting an acceleration of inflation and the 
beginning of a wage response to that said allen sinai an 
economist for the boston co and new york consulting house i 
think were in the incipient stages of a wageprice spiral 
ratajczak said higher feed costs resulting from the drought will 
prompt ranchers to send more cattle to slaughter putting an 
initial downward rather than upward pressure on food prices 
however the reduced meat supplies then will increase food 
inflation in 1989 he said and higher food inflation may 
intensify wage demands leading to modest acceleration in 1989 
that modest acceleration is defined by ratajczak as 55 percent 
inflation next year

rain brought scant relief to some farmers in the parched upper 
midwest today with thermometers expected to triple digits again 
and a meteorologist said a hurricane might be needed to end the 
drought in the southeast 
on the dwindling mississippi river a major bottleneck near 
rosedale miss was reopened when barges were freed from a 
narrowed channel but the coast guard planned to close the river 
for up to three days just north of memphis beginning tonight to 
dredge a shallow section 
in dayton ohio a hay hotline was starting today for 
farmers seeking fodder from as far west as kansas to feed their 
cattle in the face of the grasswilting drought a similar hotline 
went into effect monday for iowa farmers 
a monday evening storm in northern illinois brought the first 
significant moisture to that area in 28 days depositing up to a 
halfinch of rain light rain also fell in michigan and indiana 
any bit of rain will help but its not a cureall said 
rich brumer a national weather service meteorologist in illinois 
we need to have something like this every three days for the next 
month before we can say the drought is ended 
thunderstorms moving through northwestern minnesota and eastern 
north dakota dumped as much as 17 inches of rain in spots early 
today but another day of record heat would evaporate some of that 
moisture wind up to 50 mph cut power to some 10000 customers in 
brainerd minn 
weather service meteorologist lou ramey told ohios drought task 
force at its first meeting that the state is moving into its driest 
months and there is little hope for heavy widespread rain soon 
more than three dozen recordhigh temperatures were reported 
monday mostly across the dry midwest and more of the same was 
predicted for today 
a meteorologist said monday a hurricane might be just the trick 
to snap the dry spell in the southeast 
of course we dont want to see any hurricanes said paul 
pettit a weather service forecaster in montgomery ala but the 
hurricane and the tropical activity may be the answer to the 
longterm lack of rainfall and water replenishment that were 
probably going to need 
mississippi river barges freed last weekend from sandbar tieups 
to the north and south of memphis tenn again faced an obstacle 
the coast guard said monday 
a 1000footlong section of the mississippi six miles north of 
memphis has shrunk from 500 feet wide and 15 feet deep to 170 feet 
wide and nine feet deep due to the drought said cmdr michael 
donohoe of coast guard headquarters in memphis 
undoubtedly there will be a backlog here we could probably 
have between 800 and 1200 barges arriving at memphis over the next 
24 to 48 hours he said monday 
a dredge was scheduled to arrive today to begin scooping out the 
low spot donohoe said the river likely would be closed during the 
dredging which could take two days or more 
the freeing of a 26barge tow near rosedale and gunnison miss 
completely reopened the 730 miles of the mississippi downstream 
from memphis to the gulf of mexico the corps of engineers said 
today 
once they got the grounded tow cleared out there was a 
ninefoot channel said bob anderson a corps of engineers 
spokesman in memphis but the channel is not very wide and 
theres a pretty wicked zstyle dogleg so traffic is moving very 
gingerly right now 
the recordlow water also is creating huge sandbars that are 
drawing spectators dangerously close to the swirling mississippi 
three people drowned sunday near natchez miss when a sandbar 
they were walking on fell apart officials said 
low water and the heat also are being blamed for an extensive 
fish kill on the platte river a nebraska game and parks official 
said 
with no end in sight for the farmbelt drought grain and 
soybean futures prices spurted sharply higher monday on the chicago 
board of trade 
except for winter wheat which is already being harvested all 
grain and soybean futures on the market shot up by their daily 
allowable limits at the opening bell and didnt budge all day 
wheat futures are at their highest level in nearly seven years 
corn futures are at fouryear highs 
the montana agricultural statistics service reported monday that 
71 percent of montanas spring wheat crop is in poor or very 
poor condition compared with 62 percent a week ago 
in texas state agriculture commissioner jim hightower described 
the situation as an emergency 
in new orleans us agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
warned that the withering crops could mean disaster for farmers and 
spiraling costs for consumers 
lyng said the worst threat is in the mideasts corn belt but 
problems are looming for southern soybean growers 
corn is the most important crop in the united states soybeans 
is second lyng said if those are lost who can say what it 
will mean its never happened before

some days jack scott is sure hes 
dreaming 
scott who heads the chamber of commerce in this central ohio 
city of 8500 is overseeing what has become a rust belt rarity 
unprecedented economic growth bringing new people and money to his 
hometown and other communities in central and west central ohio 
the catalyst for the change is honda of america manufacturing 
inc the nations fourthlargest automaker which opened a tiny 
motorcycle plant here in 1980 and now employs thousands of 
whitesuited workers at auto and motorcycle plants here and at an 
engine plant in anna about 50 miles to the west 
the fortunes of honda and the suppliers that have nestled 
around it have created a boom in marysville surrounding union 
county and 13 other ohio counties the growth has sent officials 
scrambling for more land and more housing 
the honda corridor is one of the biggest growth areas in the 
state say development experts 
i wouldnt discount growth in northeast ohio toledo or 
cincinnati as far as business development said catherine 
ferrari a spokeswoman for the ohio department of development 
but it would be safe to say that this is one of them its all 
small businesses honda is a boost to that area but its the 
smaller businesses opening around it that is helping in the 
growth 
the figures speak for themselves 
from an initial work force of 17 in 1979 honda of america has 
grown to a company with 5900 workers the company calls them 
associates at three plants another auto assembly plant is to be 
built in nearby east liberty and the existing anna engine plant is 
to be expanded 
there is no sign the business boom is going to go bust any time 
soon 
honda which has invested 870 million in ohio to date and 
produces 1500 cars a day expects by 1991 to have invested 17 
billion and employ 8650 workers said company spokesman roger 
lambert the company also plans to increase the percentage of parts 
it purchases from american producers from 60 percent to 75 percent 
by 1991 
in all the investment has paid off for residents and suppliers 
in 14 ohio counties and 24 other states lambert said 
marysville about 20 miles northwest of columbus in union 
county and bellefontaine about 25 miles west of marysville in 
logan county are the two main benefactors 
folks contend that the new flow of money in the area has not 
changed those who live there 
theres still not a whole lot to do around here scott said 
people still work and go home and watch tv we like it 
but while the residents may not have changed circumstances have 
both cities in addition to increases in traffic vandalism and 
drug trafficking are rapidly running out of housing and new land 
upon which to build 
in marysville alone 250 housing starts are expected this year 
a new school building ymca library and shopping center are 
planned under construction or ready to open an 18 million 
regional shopping mall complex multifamily homes a warehouse and 
offices to serve the marysville bellefontaine urbana and kent 
areas are to be built on us 33 just east of bellefontaine that 
project is expected to create up to 900 jobs 
at least one new 18hole course inside marysville city limits is 
under construction and plans for a golf village in bellefontaine 
are in the works 
the need for golf courses grew with the arrival of the japanese 
scott said 
they love golf they play and they play they love it here 
because its so expensive to play in japan its a real luxury 
there he said 
but not everyone is happy about hondas presence or the lack 
of it 
traffic jams which never existed in the area before are 
becoming commonplace smaller employers say they are also feeling 
some pain from high turnover rates and have had to increase 
salaries to avoid losing personnel to honda and other companies 
that pay more 
there also are pockets of antijapanese sentiment lingering from 
world war ii 
william v leitz resigned in april as mayor of wapakoneta an 
auglaize county community about 12 miles north of hondas anna 
plant he said he could not in good conscience deal with the 
japanese 
i was on a destroyer in the south pacific that was sunk 
and i was in the hospital i dont care if it would have been the 
germans i would have felt the same way im an american and i 
love my country 
the 64yearold 13year mayor said he would rather quit than 
hurt the citys development efforts 
in lima about 20 miles to the north in allen county mayor gene 
joseph is angry that honda and other japanese companies moving into 
ohio have focused much of their activity outside larger cities 
joseph stirred controversy and calls for his resignation in 
early may when he claimed japanese companies do not want to locate 
in communities with sizable black populations and strong union 
traditions 
marysvilles black population is virtually nonexistent admits 
scott 
unions have never been here people just dont think that way 
thats why the uaw cant get a foot in here he said the united 
auto workers attempted to organize workers at honda but withdrew 
its request for an election in late 1985 
scott acknowledges antihonda sentiment exists but believes it 
is a fact of life in a growing city 
sure people complain a little bit but most of them are on 
their way to the bank he said 
communities benefiting from honda also are enjoying incentives 
promised to honda by the state 
natalie wymer a spokeswoman for the state development 
department said state grants for training and other incentives 
such as road construction total at least 59 million since 1977 
another 47 million has gone to suppliers that have since 
surrounded hondas operations she said the honda incentive package 
is among the largest the state has ever offered 
the state has sunk at least 2515 million and the federal 
government 654 million into the rehabilitation and widening of 
us 33 the main road through union and logan counties honda 
itself is contributing another 30 million overall an estimated 
13655 million has gone toward road renovation in the two counties 
since honda opened its doors according to state transportation 
officials 
the company has also spent millions for parts and supplies in 
the area and paid union county 5 million last year in real estate 
and personal property taxes the largest benefactor of that payment 
was the marysville school system which received 35 million he 
said

cyprus which has the worlds seventh 
largest shipping fleet is quickly building a reputation as an 
international maritime center 
the east mediterranean island which has been the center of 
trade routes between the west and the middle east for centuries 
boasts the fastest growing shipping register in the world 
our objective is to attract shippingbanks marine insurers 
lawyers and brokers through tax incentives and other facilities 
said zenon katsourides recently appointed special shipping 
consultant to president george vassiliou 
the shipping register has grown from 1487 ships and a gross 
tonnage of 96 million at the end of 1985 to 2000 ships and a 
tonnage of 17 million now katsourides said 
we want to be able to offer all the services peripheral to 
shipping by building on our existing base he told the associated 
press in an interview 
the cypriots recently announced plans to open offices in new 
york and hong kong to develop new markets for its shipping register 
parliament is discussing updating all shipping legislation 
passed in the last 30 years and the government is expanding 
facilities at larnaca a port on the south coast and the second 
largest on the island it will eventually be able to handle 60000 
containers a day 
larnaca and the other major port of limassol 35 miles to the 
west lie in the greek cypriot sector of the wardivided island 
the major port of famagusta was overrun by the turkish army 
which invaded in july 1974 the turks seized the northern onethird 
of the island which is now a breakway republic 
katsourides 48 a selfmade millionaire who retired from ship 
management in london 10 years ago to return to his native island 
bristles at charges that cyprus is a flag of convenience 
to start with 22 percent of the cyprus registry tonnage is 
cypriotowned so were a truly national flag he said 
the rest of the tonnage is owned by greek and west german 
interests each with 35 percent with the remaining 8 percent 
belonging to other nations katsourides said 
he added that the main attraction of the cypriot registry is 
that cyprus shipping law is based on english maritime legislation 
and is consequently accepted both by banks and insurance 
companies 
in addition this legislation is being constantly upgraded to 
safeguard the interests of both the owners and the seafarers he 
said 
cyprus was recently elected to the board of the international 
maritime organization and has ratified all international maritime 
conventions and agreements between owners and seamens unions he 
said 
the londonbased lloyds list a shipping industry 
newspaper said katsourides appointment was seen as a signal to 
the shipping community around the world that changes to the cyprus 
maritime administration will be given priority 
katsourides first moves after his appointment showed he is 
living up to his reputation won in the banking and offshore 
sectors as being energetic and enthusiastic the daily added 
katsourides said cyprus has already established itself as an 
important offshore banking and business center 
our intention to offer all the services peripheral to shipping 
will not only prove beneficial for owners but it will also benefit 
cyprus he said 
it has a large number of professionally qualified people 
including lawyers accountants and engineers familiar with 
shipping 
he said the large potential for future development in cyprus 
lies in shorebased shippingrelated activities 
a significant number of shipping and shipmanagement companies 
are operating on the island while marine insurance companies and 
other agencies have established local offices 
one of the cyprusbased shipmanagement companies is the west 
germancontrolled columbia ship management ltd chairman heinrich 
schoeller said his company employs 3750 people 250 ashore and 
3500 on 125 ships at sea 56 of which fly the cyprus flag 
were satisfied with the facilities offered in cyprus and the 
advantages of the cyprus flag and plan to use cyprus as our 
headquarters for many years to come he said 
government revenues from shipping currently run to about 2 
million cyprus pounds 4 million katsourides said

the government in the last few days has won 
the cooperation in its pentagon bribery probe of someone whose 
voice turned up frequently on courtordered wiretaps a source 
familiar with the matter said today 
a second target of the probe appears on the verge of 
cooperating said the source who demanded anonymity 
it could not be determined whether the target who is cooperating 
is a pentagon employee a consultant or a defense contractor 
sources familiar with the probe also said that one wiretap 
involves a conversation between former navy secretary john lehman 
jr and his thenaide melvyn paisley 
the sources said that conversation recorded late last year or 
early this year can be interpreted as being a tipoff by lehman 
that paisley might be under investigation 
attorney general edwin meese iii refused to say monday whether 
lehman is among those under scrutiny paisley and another former 
lehman aide retired adm james a ace lyons have been 
implicated 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity refused to 
describe the possible warning which investigators are examining as 
a potential obstruction of justice and which occurred after both 
lehman and paisley had left the government 
the government frequently relies on gaining the cooperation of 
participants in a whitecollar conspiracy to win the conviction of 
bigger targets 
meanwhile defense secretary frank c carlucci has issued a 
directive specifying that any pentagon employee under scrutiny in 
the bribery probe must be reassigned to a new job said spokesman 
dan howard 
confirming earlier reports from pentagon sources howard said 
carlucci had directed that anyone who became the subject of the 
investigation must be given duties that will not involve them 
in ongoing procurements or provide them access to information 
related to ongoing procurements 
while no individual has been charged yet secretary carlucci 
took this action in the interest or ensuring that the ongoing 
procurements of the department are free from question howard 
added 
the spokesman repeatedly declined to say how many pentagon 
workers had been affected by carluccis directive referring all 
such queries to the justice department 
pentagon sources demanding anonymity later disclosed the 
directive had so far led to reassignments for six employees five 
identified last week in search warrants plus a sixth unidentified 
employee whose office was not searched but who is also under 
investigation 
efforts to learn the sixth employees identity and job were not 
immediately successful the other five are

james gaines the deputy assistant navy secretary for 
acquisition management 
dr victor cohen the deputy assistant air force secretary in 
charge of buying tactical command control communications and 
computer systems his office was searched last week 
george stone a navy official in the space and naval warfare 
systems command 
stuart berlin an executive with the naval air systems command 
marine corps official jack sherman who works in the equipment 
and service acquisition section of the contracts division 
installation and logistics department 
the move by carlucci followed a highlevel meeting on monday at 
which pentagon officials reportedly studied what actions they could 
take in the case 
carlucci may also consider whether to suspend contracts with the 
companies involved in the probe including some of the biggest 
military suppliers in the country the companies offices were 
searched last week in pursuit of illicitly obtained inside 
contracting information 
suspension of contracts could be disruptive to the military 
ruinous for contractors who live or die on government business and 
damaging to their employees 
one source said he doubted so dramatic a step would be taken at 
this point because the defense department itself lacks information 
about the dimensions of the affair 
i dont think the fbi is sharing much with us yet he said 
the new york times reported today that three additional defense 
contractors hercules inc gould inc and electronic data systems 
corp a general motors corp subsidiary acknowledged that they 
had been subpoenaed in the probe 
on capitol hill meanwhile rep bill chappell chairman of the 
house appropriations defense subcommittee denied that he or any 
other member of congress is under investigation 
theres is no member of congress to my knowledge who is a 
target of this investigation and im a member of congress the 
florida democrat told reporters if theres anyone thats 
involved in the kind of activities alleged he should be brought 
swiftly to justice 
cbs news reported monday night that three congressmen reps 
thomas downey dny andrew ireland rfla and sam stratton 
dny were under scrutiny in the case but that there was not 
yet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation cbs 
said it got its information from law enforcement sources whom it 
did not identify 
spokesmen for downey and ireland said no government official had 
contacted either congressmen or their offices in connection with 
the probe downey blasted as wholly incorrect a newspaper 
article linking him with the investigation cbs said strattons 
office also said it had not been contacted 
the us attorney for the eastern district of virginia henry 
hudson who is coordinating the investigation held out the 
possibility that more information about the scope of the affair may 
come this week when more of the 38 search warrants issued a week 
ago are unsealed and made public 
one search warrant that has already been made public said the 
investigation centers on leaks of confidential information 
provided by government employees receiving bribes or gratuities 
about contracting details which could enable one company to 
outbid another 
hudson said 270 subpoenas have been issued so far and more 
search warrants may be served 
the affair came to light june 14 when federal investigators 
seized materials from defense contractors military consultants and 
defense department officials 
meese called his news conference to respond to a senators 
assertion that the justice department had squelched testimony about 
procurement corruption three years ago 
sen charles grassley riowa in a senate speech said a 
defense department investigator about to testify on his findings 
concerning procurement corruption was kept from doing so by a top 
justice department official who grabbed the microphone away from 
him 
i stopped the hearing at that point grassley said i wish 
now i hadnt there wasnt anything in that testimony that could 
have jeopardized that case 
meese at his own news conference after grassleys comments 
said i can assure you that at no time has this department had to 
be dragged into any indictment where the evidence is there 
the attorney general said that since 1985 the defense 
procurement fraud unit has obtained 35 convictions and recovered 
some 32 million

the market has been able to resist bad news and refuses to go

tomkins plc a british industrial holding company 
said tuesday it has agreed to acquire tennesseebased murray ohio 
manufacturing co the target of a hostile bid from ab electrolux 
of sweden for 224 million 
tomkins will pay 56 dollars a share for the us maker of 
lawnmowers and bicycles topping a 52ashare bid from electrolux 
that murray ohios board rejected as inadequate 
meanwhile a spokesman for ab electrolux said that in view of 
the merger announcement it is terminating its tender offer for 
murray ohio 
we thought our allcash offer of 52 per share was fully 
priced and we are not willing to pay a higher price the 
spokesman said 
murray ohio is a typical tomkins acquisition with strong 
brands in stable markets said tomkins chief executive gregory 
hutchings 
he also pointed to murray ohios unrealized potential and 
said the acquisition should produce enhanced growth in earnings 
per share for tomkins 
tomkins which changed its name from fh tomkins plc earlier 
this year already has interests in the lawnmower business in 
britain through its hayters plc and beaver equipment ltd units 
the acquisition of murray ohio would be tomkins second purchase 
in the united states after its 1125 million acquisition of smith

west germanys central bank 
tuesday announced an increase in a key interest rate sparking 
criticism that the move could worsen unemployment 
the securities repurchase rate known as the repo rate was 
increased from 325 percent to 35 percent 
a daily west german newspaper had reported last week that the 
bundesbank decided to increase the rate which it pays to trade 
securities in the open market the rate had been unchanged since 
november 
analysts said the central banks move didnt constitute a sharp 
policy reversal they said it was a reaction to several new 
economic trends such as better global economic growth prospects 
rising inflation and the strong dollar 
it was an adjustment to a changed environment said hermann 
remsperger chief economist at the berliner handels and frankfurter 
bank 
the 325 percent rate was created at a time when the world 
looked very differently from what it looks today he said 
but an increase in borrowing costs can often lead to slower 
economic growth some observers said a leading member of west 
germanys employees union said the decision endangers economic 
growth and expansion of employment opportunities when joblessness 
is already about 84 percent 
since the government up to now has failed in developing a 
program for fighting unemployment the responsibility for low 
economic growth must be tied to the monetary polities of the 
central bank said employees union board member ursula konitzer 
in a news release the alliance of west german labor unions 
dgb also blasted the rate increase saying the bundesbank was 
using the higher dollar as an excuse to hike interest rates 
using this as justification to stop the danger of inflation is 
not convincing because current price increases have been 1 percent 
for months the dgb statement said 
the dollar was hardly affected by the news remaining steady 
just below 17600 deutsche marks and west german bond prices 
firmed during tuesday morning 
it isnt clear yet whether the rate hike was a onetime move or 
the beginning of a string of interest rate hikes said remsperger 
it will depend on the market reaction he said 
but ute geipel chief economist at citibank ag citicorps 
frankfurt subsidiary said a further interest rate hike is only 
likely if the us federal reserve pushes up its own rates

government leaders tuesday moved to shore up 
japanese farming after acceding to american demands to lower 
barriers on imported beef and oranges 
key cabinet ministers and officials in the governing liberal 
democratic party emerged from a hastily called meeting tuesday 
morning with a broad outline of steps to ease the transition for 
the nations farmers 
they included trimming production costs subsidizing farmers 
buying up farmland and encouraging tangerine growers to convert 
their plots to other uses according to a statement released by the 
government 
the measures were announced one day after agriculture minister 
takashi sato and us trade representative clayton yeutter signed 
an agreement that could double the imports of american beef and 
oranges by 1991 to 1 billion a year 
the agreement came after months of negotiations and complaints 
by the united states against japans restrictive import quotas 
also tuesday the ministry of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries announced sato would head for australia on wednesday to 
work out a new beef import pact with officials in canberra 
australia provides about 60 percent of japans beef imports while 
american beef accounts for about a third 
the government statement called for drastic measures to 
stabilize the price of japanese beef calves said to cost about 10 
times as much as their american equivalents many japanese beef 
producers rely on calves sold by breeders 
the news release also called for developing new markets to boost 
demand for japanese citrus but gave no details on any of the 
proposals 
while american cattlemen and citrus growers welcomed the new 
accord japan agriculture ministry officials said they were still 
trying to assess the effect mondays agreement would have on 
japans farmers the asahi evening news said the price of japanese 
beef could plunge to half the current level but gave no time frame 
and quoted no sources 
one hundred grams or about 35 ounces of japanese beef now 
sells for about 450 yen or 356 double the local price for 
american beef 
an official at a major trading house said the trade pact which 
calls for japan to nearly double its imports of beef in three years 
and erase its quotas on imported oranges after two years was 
already worrying fishermen suppliers of a chief protein source 
that is still cheaper than homegrown beef 
this is just part of the iceberg said hiroshi kawakubo of 
nissho iwais feed and livestock department when we see below 
sea level we see a very serious impact to the entire agricultural 
system 
ryokichi morishita of daiei japans largest supermarket chain 
said it was thinkable that more trading firms and meat 
producers would try their hand at raising beef cattle overseas

drought fears drove futures prices of corn oats 
and soybeans up their limits for daily trading tuesday while wheat 
futures retreated on profittaking 
the national weather services latest sixto10 day forecast for 
hot dry weather in the midwest through the end of the month 
underpinned the rally and threatened further damage to the corn 
oat and soybean crops analysts said 
with the corn crop each week that goes by without rain means 
another 10 percent is lost said joel karlin an analyst with 
research department inc in chicago some experts estimate anywhere 
from 10 percent to 30 percent of the us corn crop has already 
been ruined by lack of rain 
still the agriculture departments weekly weather and crop 
bulletin rated most us corn in fair condition 
karlin said the soybean crop could hold out a little longer than 
corn but youre rapidly running out of this grace period before 
rains are desperately needed i think itll be around the july 4th 
weekend before yield losses occur 
wheat futures dropped on profittaking linked to the ongoing 
winter wheat harvest which is more than 20 percent complete 
according to the usda 
skyrocketing soybean prices triggered an increase in the board 
of trades daily price limit on soybean futures from 30 cents to 45 
cents a bushel for three days beginning tuesday limits on corn 
futures dropped back to 10 cents a bushel today after three days at 
15 cents

two new york investment firms once offered to buy 
large stakes in gillette co to help the company fight a takeover 
attempt by coniston partners lawyers charged in opening arguments 
in us district court 
the investment companies were identified as kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co and forstmann little amp co 
they were named during opening arguments monday in disctict 
court where coniston is trying to overturn last aprils proxy vote 
for four seats on gillettes board gillette won the contest by a 
52to48 percent margin 
gillette attorney patrick f mccartan said the investment firms 
made their offers to help gillette fight a takeover attempt by new 
yorkbased coniston and that the offers show coniston is wrong in 
arguing that gillette misled shareholders by claiming there were no 
buyers for the company 
mccartan said kohlberg kravis proposed buying preferred stock 
that could be converted into 40 percent of all shares outstanding 
and that forstmann little made a similar proposal 
but richard ziegler who is representing coniston said gillette 
lied when it told its stockholders there were no bidders for the 
company during the proxy fight 
both sides claim the other ran an unfair campaign 
mccartan said gillettes financial adviser morgan stanley amp 
co recommended against selling large interests in the company to 
either firm 
mccartan and zeigler also disagreed over a chart that gillette 
ran as a newspaper advertisement two days before the proxy election 
coniston said the chart unfairly depicted the companys 
relationship with tito tettamanti a swiss financier coniston said 
tettamanti is an investor but does not control coniston investment 
strategy 
gillette claimed tettamanti controls companies connected with 
coniston behind the scenes and that coniston violated federal 
securities law by trying to conceal his involvement in the gillette 
takeover attempt coniston lawyers denied the allegations

a settlement was reached tuesday in a 
lawsuit against the us importers of audi after the judge set 
aside a jury verdict that a faulty audi transmission caused a 1985 
accident a company spokesman said 
the court refused to confirm the agreement citing an order of 
confidentiality but joe bennett a spokesman for audi in detroit 
said new york supreme court justice matthew f coppola agreed to a 
motion by an attorney for volkswagen of america audis us 
importer to set aside the jurys liability verdict 
bennett said the judge cited inadvertent references to 
postmanufacturing design changes despite the courts ruling to the 
contrary the jurys exposure to media coverage of the trial and 
reported discussion among jurors about the case before 
deliberations began 
bennett said it was learned that jurors had been talking among 
themselves since the second day of the trial 
the courts concern that the defendants rights might have 
been prejudiced as a result requires that the verdict be set aside 
in the interest of justice bennett said quoting from the 
judges decision 
on thursday the jury found volkswagen of america liable for the 
1985 accident in which marie lynette ruston 38 of purdys was 
injured a 1979 audi driven by sally mears of scarsdale suddenly 
accelerated striking a car which in turn hit ms rustons 1979 
toyota 
ms ruston suffered back injuries underwent disc surgery and 
had to give up her nursing career as a result of the accident 
according to testimony given during the liability trial 
ms mears bought the used car in 1983 it had been the subject 
of two recalls but neither ms mears or the previous owner had 
taken it in for the repairs 
the jury exonerated ms mears and blamed the accident on a 
defective transmission it began hearing testimony friday to 
determine what damages ms ruston should receive 
ms ruston had sought damages of 3 million in her suit though 
barred from discussing the settlement ms rustons attorney 
thomas decaro said were happy with the result 
two days before the jury verdict here audi was cleared by an 
ohio jury in the 1986 death of a 6yearold canton boy who was 
killed when his mothers audi lunged forward while she shifted 
gears pinning him between the car and a garage door the boys 
parents had sued for 48 million

international business machines corp trumpeted 
a new series of midsized computers tuesday in its biggest product 
announcement ever and ibm watchers said the application system400 
series would mean billions in revenue for the computer giant 
ibm pulled out all the stops including filling a new york stage 
with actors who extolled the new computers in skits set in a bank 
hospital and toy factory 
advertising for the as400 computers will include network 
television commercials featuring alan alda and the rest of the gang 
from mash 
the as400 series is the heir to the system 36 and system 38 
the biggestselling computers ever above the ranks of personal 
computers with roughly 300000 installed worldwide 
ibms stock which has languished for months rose 312 a 
share to 12025 a share in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading it was not clear how much of the rise was the result of 
the computer announcement 
ibm said the application system400 was the result of its most 
extensive hardware and software undertaking 
in a delicate software compromise a team based in rochester 
minn built the as400 so it can run programs written for either 
of the predecessor machines overcoming a troubling schism in the 
middle of its midrange product line 
ibm has a real family now and they havent had anything like 
this for a long time said sonny monosson editor of a newsletter 
called monosson on dec 
although press speculation before the announcement focused on 
ibms competition with digital equipment corp analysts said 
existing ibm customers would be the most important and easiest 
market for the six models of the as400 
if ibm replaced every one of the existing system 36 38 and 
older system 34 machines with an as400 at an average of 75000 
it could generate 22 billion in revenue said stephen cohen an 
analyst for gartner securities corp 
realistically cohen said he expects ibm to bring in 800 
million this year by selling 8000 of the computers next years 
sales could total 20000 he said 
ibm said its biggest target for the as400 is small and 
mediumsized businesses which it called the biggest 
fastestgrowing segment of the worlds economy 
but the company is also hoping to place computers in the 
departments of big companies a market where it has less of a 
grasp and will face tougher competition from digital equipment corp 
still the as400s ability to run the same programs across a 
wide range of machines helps ibm in its battle with digital 
theyre offering everything that dec offers i think theyre 
going to prevent dec from weaning away ibm customers monosson 
said 
in addition to digital ibm faces competition from such 
companies as hewlettpackard co ncr corp wang laboratories 
inc altos computer systems and various european and japanese 
competitors 
ibm chose the longest day of the year for its eighthour 
program part of which was televised by satellite to more than 
100000 people across the united states in what the company said 
may have been the biggest private business broadcast ever another 
70000 people in other countries attended briefings 
although much information about the as400 computers had leaked 
out several observers said they were surprised and impressed by 
the breadth of the product line the top of the line is as powerful 
as ibms 4381 mainframe computers 
by the early 1990s ibm expects to have built models of the 
as400 that will be as powerful as the lower rungs of its 3090 
series its biggest mainframe computers 
some analysts had expected ibm to introduce some of the models 
under the name as200 but the company decided to unify all of them 
under the as400 name 
ibm said all six of the computers will be available worldwide in 
august that is an unusually short lag that ensures the machines 
will have time to make a big difference in ibms 1988 revenue 
also unusual is the amount of software that will be available 
immediately a crucial consideration for businesses that rely on 
standard packages of programs 
ibm and more than 130 cooperating companies announced more than 
1000 software packages in such fields as retailing manufacturing 
finance health insurance and education 
in a change of strategy ibm worked closely with other 
companies not only on software but on the design of the computers 
which was based on extensive consultation with customers 
we cant go it alone anymore said terry lautenbach general 
manager of ibm united states 
in a sign of ibms dependence on others 81 percent of the 
as400 models will be placed with users not by ibm but by partner 
companies known as valueadded resellers that add special features 
such as customized software 
including operating system software and data storage devices 
prices of the new computers will range from about 40000 to more 
than 1 million 
about six in 10 of the new computers will be sold outside the 
united states

stock prices advanced sharply late tuesday and 
pushed the dow jones industrial average back over the 2100 level 
after a seesaw session influenced largely by conflicting signals 
on inflation and interest rates 
buying intensified near the close and pushed the key index of 30 
industrials 2524 points higher to 2110917 more than erasing the 
2009point loss of the previous session 
broader stock indicators also rose but trading was erratic and 
mixed through most of the day reflecting considerable confusion 
about the markets immediate direction 
were in a tugofwar said peter j dapuzzo manager of 
retail equities at shearson lehman hutton inc people have money 
on the sidelines coming in on the belief that interest rates seem 
to be holding steady but the bears are selling on fear that the 
drought will cause higher prices and inflation 
stocks strengthened early in the session after the labor 
department reported a 03 percent rise in may consumer prices 
lower than expected but the market weakened on fear that the 
federal reserve was tightening credit along with sharply higher 
commodity prices caused by the drought 
wall street rallied again on news from the treasury department 
that the federal budget deficit narrowed last month to 225 
billion vs 356 billion a year earlier initially suggesting a 
significant improvement that could reduce the governments enormous 
borrowing needs and thereby keep interest rates down 
although stocks remained higher closer scrutiny showed the 
deficit for the first eight months of the fiscal year was greater 
than the yearearlier period this suggested that stocks could 
retreat again wednesday 
on the close a lot of traders started realizing we had a 
better treasury budget number because of tax collections said 
jack barbanel a futures strategist at gruntal amp co in new york 
so its difficult to assess whether the budget deficit really 
reflects an improvement or is just temporary 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9to5 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
937 issues up 543 down and 467 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse totaled 15506 million shares

nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trading at regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market 
totaled 18070 million shares 
the most prominent nyse issue was texaco up 1 to 48 on volume 
of about 4 million shares rumors ranged from a possible hostile 
takeover attempt by strategist carl icahn to a large stock 
repurchase by the oil company 
ibm rose 3 120 after the company announced a new family of 
computers the advance helped inspire buying in other technology 
stocks notably compaq up 3 to 60 prime up to 15 and 
hewlett packard up to 54 in the overthecounter market apple 
rose to 44 and intel rose 1 to 36

the dollar was narrowly lower against most major 
foreign currencies tuesday amid expectations that european interest 
rates would rise 
gold prices were mixed republic national bank of new york 
quoted a bid of 45170 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt 
up from 45070 late monday 
were looking at the possibility that some of the european 
common market countries may be raising their interest rates said 
jack barbanel a first vice president with gruntal amp co inc 
the deutsche bundesbank west germanys central bank raised its 
interest rate on onemonth securities repurchase agreements tuesday 
to 35 percent from 325 percent higher interest rates in other 
countries make their investments more attractive and could depress 
demand for the dollar 
barbanel said there was no indication that the federal reserve 
would nudge us interest rates higher which would make them more 
competitive with foreign yields 
however ronald holzer chief foreignexchange dealer with 
harris trust amp co in chicago said the relatively high federal 
funds rate was evidence that us rates were edging upward the fed 
funds rate the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans was quoted at 75 percent late tuesday 
it appears all rates are moving higher pretty much in tandem 
and that portends to keep the dollar fairly well bid holzer said 
the analysts said the economic summit in toronto attended by 
president reagan and the heads of six other western nations had 
little effect on the dollar 
the foreign currency markets are for the most part ignoring 
whats going on said barbanel its more of a public relations 
summit meeting 
traders were heartened however by a compromise on third world 
debt reached at the meeting barbanel said 
under the compromise nations have several options for granting 
debt relief they include extending the time period for paying off 
loans reducing interest rates or actually writing off a portion of 
the loans 
the compromise relieves pressure on big us banks which have 
made billions of dollars in loans to developing nations barbanel 
said 
in tokyo where trading was completed before the end of the 
summit the dollar rose 024 japanese yen to a closing 12633 yen

the federal deposit insurance corp may try again 
to sell 12 billion in troubled loans it acquired as part of the 
1984 bailout of continental illinois national bank and trust co 
the agencys first effort to unload the loans failed when none 
of the bids met the minimum price or other conditions it had set 
fdic officials said 
anytime you put something up for sale and you dont sell it 
it can be regarded as a disappointment said arthur lotrentzen 
jr assistant director of credit at the fdic in washington 
but he said some bidders expressed interest in some of the loans 
and that the agency might be able to sell portions of them 
the fdic had predicted that it would lose 17 billion of the 
35 billion it paid for the loans from continental when it saved 
the bank from failure four years ago 
the attempted sale was the biggest ever by the fdic and the 
first in which the agency revealed the minimum price it would 
accept 
the agency announced it was seeking a minimum of 4157 million 
or 33 cents on the dollar for the entire loan portfolio which 
includes 520 loans in six industry categories 
none of the bids conformed to what we sent out said thomas 
beshara chicago regional director of the fdics division of 
liquidation 
beshara refused to say how many bids were received nor would he 
say if the bids received by the fdic is an indication that the 
loans may be of poorer quality than the agency estimated 
now however the agency will review the feasibility of holding 
more negotiations with bidders or discussing the sale of smaller 
parcels of loans 
the interest certainly is there in breakdowns of loan 
categories beshara added were looking with a positive 
attitude toward any future negotiations 
the six loan categories are international oil and gas 
commercial personal maritime and real estate the largest amount 
of loans 6249 million is in the oil and gas field

disclose the value of the transaction at a news conference and 
company officials said that it had not been decided yet how sabena 
will pay for the planes

sabena order but a company spokesman in seattle said a price range 
for the twinjet planes was 380 million to 444 million 
the statecontrolled company said that it would have a 
completely renewed short and mediumhaul fleet by 1992 the year

one figure implicated through wiretaps in the 
pentagon procurement bribery and fraud probe agreed within the past 
few days to cooperate with the government and another is on the 
verge of agreeing to tell what he knows sources familiar with the 
investigation said tuesday 
meanwhile defense secretary frank c carlucci decided to 
reassign six pentagon officials under scrutiny in the 
investigation he directed that anyone whose activities come under 
examination must be moved to different jobs that have nothing to do 
with procurement 
president reagan in a news conference in toronto canada 
during the economic summit said he was very upset about 
reports of wrongdoing within the multibillion dollar defense 
procurement industry 
but he praised investigators for ferreting out the misdeeds and 
said it was understandable how such things could happen in a 
huge government bureaucracy 
the person who is cooperating with the government is someone 
whose voice turned up frequently on the courtordered wiretaps that 
are a central part of the twoyear investigation said the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning 
contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
it could not be determined whether the target who is cooperating 
is a pentagon employee a consultant or someone working for a 
defense contractor 
the government frequently relies on gaining the cooperation of 
participants in a whitecollar conspiracy to win the conviction of 
bigger targets 
some of the wiretaps in the twoyear bribery probe were in place 
for 290 days in 1987 and picked up 4764 conversations of which 
671 were categorized as incriminating according to federal cour 
records 
the records identify the matter only as a bribery probe in the 
eastern district of virginia but several sources confirmed that 
the taps listed in the records involved the pentagon case 
meanwhile other sources familiar with the investigation said 
one wiretap involves a conversation between former navy secretary 
john lehman jr and his procurement aide melvyn paisley 
the sources said the conversation recorded late last year or 
early this year can be interpreted as being a tipoff by lehman 
that paisley might be under investigation 
attorney general edwin meese iii refused to say monday whether 
lehman is among those under scrutiny paisley and another former 
lehman aide retired adm james a ace lyons have been 
implicated 
the sources refused to describe the possible warning which 
investigators are examining as a potential obstruction of justice 
and which occurred after lehman and paisley had left the government 
in the spring of 1987 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said he didnt know if lehman had 
been told of the investigation by the naval investigative service 
or nis 
james h webb who succeeded lehman as secretary of the navy 
william ball the current navy secretary and air force secretary 
edward c aldridge received general briefings about the existence 
of the fraud probe from nis after assuming office howard told 
reporters 
webb ball and aldridge did not know how the fbi had broadened 
the navy investigation however and carlucci did not learn of the 
probe until the day before search warrants were served last week 
howard said 
meanwhile the spokesman said carlucci has issued a directive 
specifying that any pentagon employee who became the subject of 
the investigation must be given substitute duties that will not 
involve them in ongoing procurements or provide them access to 
information related to ongoing procurements 
carlucci took the action so that pentagon purchasing is free 
from question howard said 
pentagon sources demanding anonymity said the directive had 
led to reassignments for six employees five men identified last 
week in search warrants plus a sixth unidentified employee whose 
office was not searched but who is also under investigation 
the five whose names are known include james gaines the deputy 
assistant navy secretary for acquisition management dr victor 
cohen the deputy assistant air force secretary in charge of buying 
tactical command control communications and computer systems 
whose office was searched last week and george stone a navy 
official in the space and naval warfare systems command 
also reassigned were stuart berlin an executive with the naval 
air systems command and marine corps official jack sherman who 
works in the equipment and service acquisition section of the 
contracts division installation and logistics department

pillsbury co had a disappointing year in its 
recentlycompleted fiscal 1988 but may have record results this 
year because of the benefits of a major restructuring chairman 
william spoor said tuesday 
we overpromised and we underperformed spoor said of 
fiscal 1988 its simple and its pretty clear but thats all 
behind us 
he told a gathering of food industry analysts that the companys 
financial results for the year ending in may expected to be 
released in a week will show earnings fell to between 80 cents and 
85 cents a share from 210 a share a year ago mostly because of 
restructuring costs 
without those costs spoor said profits in fiscal 1988 would 
have been 240 to 250 a share 
he said sales amounted to about 62 billion compared with 613 
billion a year ago 
pillsbury reported earnings of 1819 million in fiscal 1987 
spoor who retired as chairman in 1985 but returned in march 
after chairman john stafford resigned said his interim rule will 
end by september when a new leader is chosen from outside the 
company in time for the annual board of directors meeting 
it will be his responsibility to lead pillsbury back to 
premiership spoor said weve got a marvelous group of young 
giants within the company but theyre just not there yet 
the restructuring which included a writeoff of 141 million in 
the third quarter cleared the decks of a great deal of dead wood 
and debris from failures of past decisions he said 
the company in fiscal 1988 closed 30 of its steak and ale and 
bennigans restaurants decided to remodel 200 burger king 
restaurants and dropped its four other restaurant chains 
spoor said 1989 will bring record earnings despite plans to 
invest 80 million in restaurant remodeling and 50 million in 
marketing and improvements to restaurant operations mostly for 
burger king 
even though burger king sales increased with the addition of 400 
new locations in fiscal 1988 individual store sales remained flat 
said roger headrick pillsburys chief financial officer who spoke 
in place of former reaturant group head j jeffrey campbell whose 
resignation was announced monday 
our most critical current issue is the lack of growth in top 
line sales said headrick who noted that a 1 percent unit sales 
growth at the companys 5600 burger king restaurants would 
increase earnings per share by 35 cents we need to bring the 
customer back 
spoor said the restructuring in 1988 included a flattening 
of the corporate chain of command for example headrick said 100 
positions have been cut at restaurant headquarters 
spoor repeated earlier statements that burger king is not for 
sale and pillsbury is not a corporate takeover target to the best 
of our knowledge 
some of you in this room have speculated on potential and 
likely acquirers and even friendly merger suggestions spoor 
said but you are badly off base

howard said he did not know if security clearances held by the 
reassigned employees had been revoked he said it would be 
premature to consider reopening previous contract competitions 
because of allegations made to date and declined comment when 
asked if any military personnel on active duty were facing 
inquiries 
asked if any defense contractors were facing a suspension of 
their right to bid on new contracts because of the allegations 
howard replied there are no actions of that type at this point 
the investigation began with a tip from a former navy department 
employee to nis said a navy source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the exnavy employee working for a defense contractor was 
approached by a consultant offering confidential information for 
sale the employee agreed to have his conversations recorded with 
the consultant the consultant later agreed to cooperate with the 
government and recorded his conversations with others said the 
sources 
on capitol hill former pentagon investigator robert l segal 
said the justice department had substantive evidence that there 
was massive fraud in military weapons purchases three years ago 
but failed to pursue the case 
segal who worked one year as the pentagons liaison with the 
procurement fraud unit in the justice department described himself 
as frustrated due to a terrible lack of competence at the fraud 
unit which was not prepared to handle an involved case 
sen charles grassley riowa had contended monday that the 
justice department could have conducted the current fraud and 
bribery probe three years ago but meese defended his department 
saying that at no time has this department had to be dragged into 
any indictment where the evidence is there 
sen steve symms ridaho a member of the senate armed services 
committee said that while he did not condone corruption in defense 
procurement the current investigation is not that big a deal 
compared with the magnitude of payments and other activities during 
world war ii 
todays eyeballs would roll at the actions 40 years ago when 
fighter planes were developed to counter those of the japanese and 
germans he said in a telephone news conference with idaho 
reporters 
the defense department made public financial disclosure forms 
provided by paisley who worked for the pentagon from 1981 to 
march 1987 and his longterm associate gaines the 
nowreassigned deputy assistant secretary of the navy for 
acquisition management 
paisley whose office was bugged and whose telephone was tapped 
listed assets of between 417000 and 12 million in may 1987 two 
months after he left government his liabilities mortgages on 
three rental properties were between 80000 and 200000 
the forms also show that in april 1983 paisley disqualified 
himself from matters dealing with bdm corp an 
engineeringtechnical services firm in mclean va where his wife 
worked previously mrs paisley was employed by computer sciences 
corp in falls church va and boeing computer services in 
seattle wash 
in 1986 paisley also disqualified himself from matters 
pertaining to the boeing co where he had worked for 28 years 
because of questions raised by the justice department regarding his 
prior employment by the aerospace company and his severance 
payments from it paisley also was getting retirement pension 
payments of about 29000 a year from boeing 
there has been no indication that either bdm or boeing have been 
searched or subpoenaed by federal investigators 
telephone calls about paisley and bdm were referred to bdms 
director of public affairs stephanie bolick who was out of the 
office and not immediately available for comment 
gaines who had worked for paisley at boeing and at the 
pentagon listed assets of between more than 240000 and 795000 
in a form filed in august 1987 gaines also disqualified himself 
from dealings with boeing 
in st louis the fbi filed a list of items collected last 
tuesday in a search of the office of thomas gunn marketing vice 
president of mcdonnell douglas corp among the items seized were 
two 1988 desk top calendars a stenographic notebook with phone 
numbers and information a memo from gunn re paisley associates 
inc dated 41587 and a folder marked atf advanced tactical 
fighter paisley associates was headed by melvyn paisley and the

the federal judge who ruled in polaroid corps 
landmark 57 billion patent infringement suit against eastman 
kodak co withdrew from the case tuesday because her late 
motherinlaw owned 100000 in kodak stock 
it was the second time in as many weeks that us district court 
judge rya zobel pulled out of a case because of an alleged conflict 
of interest 
in a statement tracing her involvement in the polaroidkodak 
case zobel said neither side objected to her motherinlaws 
holdings at the outset of proceedings in 1981 
the court informed all parties of the holdings before 
opening statements and the taking of any evidence zobel wrote 
throughout the 75 days of trial kodaks silence continued 
zobel stated kodak remained silent even after she ruled in 1985 
that the rochester nybased camera company had violated nine 
polaroid patents when it entered the instant camera market she 
said kodak also did not raise the issue during a lengthy appeal 
process 
shortly after her motherinlaw died zobel on may 9 told 
attorneys from both sides she intended to recuse herself from the 
case because she and her husband had become the beneficiaries of 
her motherinlaws estate 
the judge acquiesced after both sides encouraged her to continue 
in the case and asked her for time to research the situation 
but in a motion filed june 15 in us district court kodak 
called for zobels immediate disqualification and dismissal of all 
of her rulings in the case since october 1981 including the 1985 
patent ruling 
kodak also recommended an award of less than 200 million to 
polaroid for any profits lost to kodaks line of instant cameras 
and film which ceased production under a court order on jan 9 
1986 
noting the delay in kodaks action zobel wrote 
to date neither party has submitted any authority even 
suggesting the incorrectness of the courts stated postion indeed 
for the first time since october 5 1981 kodak asks for recusal 
kodak spokesman henry kaska refused to comment on why the firm 
waited seven years before objecting to zobels holdings but said 
there may have been some misunderstanding at the may 9 meeting 
our counsel had not understood the judge to have made final 
determination to withdraw he said our counsel understood the 
judge asked the parties for their views on the subject and our 
motion was in response to that request 
harry johnson a spokesman for cambridgebased polaroid said 
the case was reassigned to judge a david mazzone he said polaroid 
believed zobels rulings would stand 
the damages portion of the case is to begin in january 1989 
last week zobel withdrew from a proxy suit involving gillette 
co and coniston group case after learning that gillette chairman 
colman m mockler was a fellow of harvard college and a member of 
the harvard corporation zobel is a member of the board of 
overseers of harvard college

the chairman of pennwalt co said tuesday 
the company would fight an buyout offer by centaur partners and 
rejecting a meeting with the investor group 
we will strenuously fight any takeover attempt which we 
believe not to be in the best interests of our shareholders 
pennwalt chairman edwin e tuttle said in a letter to shareholders 
in a separate letter to centaur tuttle rejected a meeting 
requested by the group saying management was in the best position 
to restructure the company 
in a news release centaur said the managements actions 
reflect their concern with entrenching themselves in their jobs 
rather than benefitting the shareholders who own the other 987 
percent of the company 
pennwalts stock closed tuesday up 1 at 8075 a share on the 
new york stock exchange based on its nearly 115 million 
outstanding shares common sharse the company would have a market 
value of about 9286 million 
centaur which holds 76 percent of pennwalts outstanding 
shares had proposed a friendly takeover that it said would be at 
a significant premium to the market price 
our offer to negotiate with pennwalt our possible purchase of 
all shares at a premium in a friendly transaction still stands but 
in light of pennwalts reply we are examining our other options 
centaur stated 
the options include purchasing shares on the open market 
private negotiations with shareholders and merger said centaur 
spokesman mark greenberg 
in a related development spokesman peter mccarthy denied that 
pennwalts efforts to sell its pharmaceutical division represented 
an effort to thwart a takeover by enhancing the companys cash 
position 
we might not have announced our intention without the centaur 
partners move but the decision to do so consider selling the 
division was made several months ago he said 
pennwalts pharmaceuticals division accounted for about 11 
percent of sales and 14 percent of operating earnings last year 
pennwalt which employs 9000 had profit of 538 million last 
year 
centaur comprises melvyn j estrin of washington dc a 
financier and real estate investor and former chairman of american 
health services abbey j butler president of cb equities with 
assets in excess of 500 million and former chairman of financial 
world magazine and robert nederlander a lawyer and president of 
nederlander organization corp which owns broadway theaters and 
also part owner of the new york yankees baseball team 
the 138yearold pennwalt started as a salt manufacturer and now 
makes products ranging from cough syrup to chemicals and smelting 
precious metals for dentists and dental laboratories

if winners emerge from the drought that 
has sent grain prices skyrocketing they will be farmers lucky 
enough to keep crops intact and those with surpluses from prior 
harvests a farm economist said tuesday 
the us treasury also could benefit if the dry spell continues 
over the nations grain belt but agriculture as a total would be 
a net loser iowa state university economist robert wisner said 
in the meantime despite grain prices nearly double last years 
highs people are apprehensive of what might happen said peter 
brent who coordinates a hot line for troubled farmers for the 
rural advocacy group prairiefire everybodys sitting tight 
praying it will rain 
in iowa which was sweltering through its third straight day of 
tripledigit temperatures soybean prices rose to an 11year high 
at elevators tuesday with one bid reaching 10 a bushel corn rose 
to its highest level since september 1984 with bids over 3 a 
bushel common 
the high prices reflect fears that drought will curb harvests at 
a time when 96 percent of the states topsoil is reported too dry 
as is 91 percent of its subsoil still agriculture officials said 
timely rains could save most of the crop although 12 percent of 
the soybean crop is reported in poor condition and 1 percent is 
very poor while 7 percent of the corn is poor and 1 percent is 
very poor 
eric wahl who raises corn soybeans and hogs at monticello in 
northeast iowa said hes not had any significant rain since 
mothers day more than six weeks ago and the few sprinkles 
weve had since havent been enough to wash the dust off the corn 
leaves 
we have the potential for a pretty reasonable crop if rains 
resume he said but as dry weather continues the potential for 
a good crop diminishes by the hour 
wahl said hed like to be able to cash in on the rising grain 
prices which on futures markets closed tuesday at 334 a bushel 
for corn delivered in july and at 1046 a bushel for july 
soybeans 
but wahl isnt sure hell have much to harvest he said he will 
need his stored corn to feed his livestock and sold his stored 
beans last april when the price was 640 a bushel 
farmers who do have grain to sell are also facing tough 
decisions whether to sell now or wait for even higher prices 
knowing that any return to normal rainfall would wash out the price 
rally 
the big winners of the drought would be farmers with reasonably 
good crops and large carryovers of surplus grain from previous 
harvests wisner said 
but most of that surplus is corn stored under government 
programs 
farmers would have to deduct the government loan they already 
have received on that crop plus accumulated interest and storage 
costs before realizing any profit on such sales and the gain 
would be a lot less than you might think at first glance 
wisner said 
he said if feed grain yields are ravaged it will be an 
especially hard blow outside the corn belt to operators of cattle 
feed lots large dairies and poultry operators who will face 
sharply higher feed bills 
for consumers its almost certain to mean some increase in 
food costs he said its too early to say how much it depends 
on how long the dry weather lasts 
but consumers could see lower prices for meat in the near future 
as some farmers thin herds because of scarce feed however brent 
said that could mean short supplies and higher prices later on 
if we see continued dry weather well into summer agriculture 
as a total would be a net loser wisner said prices would not 
go up high enough to offset the lower yields and reduced government 
deficiency payments 
deficiency payments represent the difference between the 
governments target price for corn 293 a bushel in 1988 and the 
market price received by farmers enrolled in the farm program 
with corn prices going up there will be less drain on the us 
treasury as federal deficiency payments to farmers shrink wisner 
said

the drought has reduced many of the nations 
rivers and streams to record lows as it threatens navigation 
reduces electrical generation and makes beaches unusable 
government agencies said tuesday 
the us geological survey reported that may had the lowest 
percentage of river stations with flow in the normal to 
abovenormal range not only for may but also for any month in the 
last six years 
the agency said 54 percent of 191 river measuring stations were 
normal or better down from 66 percent in april 
in our south atlantic division we had a 33 percent deficiency 
in power generation last week and 96 percent of the public beaches 
at the divisions reservoirs are not usable said bob page 
assistant secretary of the army for civil works 
the corps of engineers has dredges at work trying to keep the 
ohio and mississippi rivers open to navigation page added at a 
news briefing 
normally we would expect conditions such as we have now to 
occur in late august added maj gen thomas sands acting 
director for civil works 
and said page we dont see any signs of its getting better 
in the short term 
page said low water has also affected electrical generating 
capacity in the pacific northwest but that no electrical shortages 
are anticipated because power is available for transfer from other 
regions 
the geological survey said the low flows reported at nearly half 
the nations streams and rivers included several record lows 
the saline river at rye ark dropped to only 10 percent of 
normal flow and there was only 15 percent of normal water in the 
tombigbee river at coatopa ala 
the geological survey reported streamflows of only 21 percent of 
normal in the peace river at arcadia fla and the buffalo river 
near st joe ark the french broad river at asheville nc at 40 
percent of normal also set a record low flow for the month 
the survey said the combined flow of the nations three largest 
rivers the mississippi st lawrence and columbia averaged 617 
billion gallons per day during the month 37 percent below normal 
and the second lowest combined flow in 60 years these three rivers 
drain about half of the contiguous 48 states 
regionally streamflows were lowest in california in may at 42 
percent below average for the month flows were down 40 percent in 
the great basin of nevada and utah 29 percent in the pacific 
northwest and 18 percent in the southeast 
monthend contents of many reservoirs were lower than those of 
may in previous drought years 1987 for the west and 1986 for the 
southeastern states 
reservoir levels were in the belownormal range in north dakota 
montana idaho wyoming california and nevada 
belowaverage levels were also reported at all five sites in the 
tennessee valley clark hill reservoir in south carolina and 
georgia and lake sidney lanier in georgia 
the great lakes were in the normal range except for lake 
superior where the monthly mean fell below normal for the first 
time since 1982 
as for underground water supplies measured in wells water 
levels fell in the southeast and southwest new lows for the month 
were recorded for the sand aquifer near memphis tenn the eutaw 
formation at montgomery ala and the hueco bolson near el paso 
texas and in a key well at jackson la 
on the other hand three record high flows were also recorded in

moisture than we can stand to lose said harold hunzicker 
agricultural adviser in marion county ill were still hanging 
in there but that is not to say we couldnt have a disaster
