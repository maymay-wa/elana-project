the warsaw pact on thursday proposed to 
include western soviet territory as part of central europe in 
conventional arms reduction talks western delegates said 
west german officials said the proposal eases nato concerns that 
the territory would be considered a socalled rear area that could 
supply a warsaw pact advance the proposal would limit a buildup of 
forces on the western soviet border 
czech delegate ladislav balcar proposed that the territory from 
the atlantic to the urals be divided into four zones involved in 
reductions of troops tactical air force helicopters tanks 
armored vehicles and artillery 
nato officials said the east accepted the western demand for 
inclusion of the soviet unions western military district in the 
central european zone that soviet district includes the baltic 
transcarpathian and byelorussian areas which had been considered 
rear areas 
the warsaw pact envisions the central european zone as also 
including east germany poland czechoslovakia and hungary nato 
countries in that area would be denmark belgium the netherlands 
luxembourg west germjany france and britain 
however france and britain have not been part of that zone so 
far in the western concept 
the north european zone would include the northern part of the 
leningrad military zone and norway the southern zone would consist 
of romania bulgaria the odesssa north caucasian and 
transcaucasian military zones italy greece and turkey 
the fourth or rear zone would include the southern part of 
the leningrad military zone the moscow volga and urals military 
zones spain portugal and iceland 
the complex negotiations on conventional armed forces in europe 
opened in march the warsaw pact has a large edge over the north 
atlantic treaty organization in nonnuclear strength 
nato proposed in march a limit of 12000 tanks 10000 artillery 
pieces and 16800 armored troop carriers for any one nation it 
wants weaponry stationed outside ones home country limited to 3200 
tanks 1700 artillery pieces and 6000 armored troop carriers in 
each bloc

almost every day a small group shows up on 
parliament hill to protest prime minister brian mulroneys austerity 
budget but they have yet to set off nationwide outcries against 
belttightening and higher taxes 
mulroneys government drew up the austerity budget as a means of 
controlling canadas budget deficit and austerity may be the tone 
he is setting at least for the start of his second term 
mulroney led his progressive conservative party to a second 
consecutive majority government last fall in an election whose 
overwhelming issue was approval of the free trade agreement with the 
united states 
his victory cleared the way for the pact to take effect jan 1 as 
scheduled 
however his critics charge that since the trade agreement was 
the key issue in the campaign the election outcome did not give 
mulroney a mandate to tackle the budget deficit at the expense of 
programs that the canadian government traditionally has supported 
although the canadian public has remained largely silent a 
gallup poll published june 15 indicated that only 30 percent of 
canadians would vote now for mulroney compared to 45 percent for 
the opposition liberal party led by john turner it was the 
progressive conservatives worst showing in that opinion poll since 
november 1987 
but the prime minister has little to worry about for now 
he is at least three years away from having to call another 
election and early in his term is an ideal time to put unpopular 
programs into place 
several factors appear to be working in mulroneys favor to 
defuse any public indignation at what once would have been 
unthinkable changes in government programs such as unemployment 
insurance 
both major opposition parties are involved in internal races of 
their own because their longtime leaders have announced they are 
stepping down 
the liberals wont pick a new leader until june 1990 although 
turner is staying on in the interim and spearheading his partys 
criticism of the budget 
the socialist new democratic party which scored 21 percent in 
the june gallup poll will pick a new leader to replace veteran ed 
broadbent at the outset of winter 
mulroney and his supporters also started immediately after the 
november election to lay the groundwork for the plans to bring the 
deficit under control 
the alternative is to keep this mountain of debt growing and 
place it on the backs of your kids and grandchildren mulroney 
told canadians 
what brought more public furor was a leak of the budget the night 
before it was to be released april 27 a violation of traditional 
canadian secrecy about the document until it is officially reported 
in parliament 
the debate about the leak lasted weeks and as political 
columnist carol goar wrote in the toronto star it kept the 
nations mind off one of the most painful and pivotal budgets in 
recent history 
in the meantime analysts say they have found that as little as 
one fifth of the savings in the budget intended for deficit control 
come from spending restraints the rest comes from increasing taxes 
a survey by the private global economics consulting firm found 
that tax increases amounted to nearly 72 billion canadian dollars 
6 billion of the 9 million dollars 75 billion that could be 
considered deficit control measures 
lloyd axworthy one of the most prominent liberal members in 
parliament said much of the impact of the prime ministers budget 
has been camouflaged 
theres going to be a delayed reaction he maintained in an 
interview i dont think theyre out of the woods on the budget at 
all its like a perpetual toothache 
despite the raised taxes and cut expenses a deficit for 198990 
remains of 305 billion canadian dollars 253 billion that has 
prompted mulroneys supporters in the business community to charge 
that he has not moved strongly enough to bring the deficit under 
control 
the ratio of debt to gross domestic product is about 5 percent 
double that of the united states and second only to italy among the 
leading industrial nations

the leading role of the party understood in a mechanical way 
already is history today the party like other political forces 
seeks public confidence and support it is looking for allies and 
partners to form a parliamentary coalition western democratic 
institutions were also born in an evolutionary way 
building support for the party as shown among other things in 
the recent elections has been limited of course it is connected 
not only with mistakes in party policy it also is linked to the 
fact that the party as the decisive force became saddled with 
responsibility for above everything economic misfortunes what was 
supposed to be a strength turned out to be a weakness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in this sense a good intention ideologically and theoretically 
justified and honestly formulated by us in practice has not yet 
borne fruit we didnt manage to fully prove to society that the 
party is becoming different that is why i think that if the party 
will honestly and i believe in this implement its program then 
it will have a chance to rebuild its influence in society of 
course never again on the basis of monopoly we have become 
convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy thing not only in the 
economy but also in political life but it should be based on is a 
program around which a genuine coalition may be created it is in 
the interest of all political forces both coalition and opposition 
to overcome these difficulties because not overcoming them would be 
a disaster not only for the party but also for the opposition it 
would be polands disaster

i havent gone to confession in a very long time and i can see 
that you want me to confess but i used to go i used to go we 
expect democracy from ourselves and you expect from me a 
oneperson statement about the presidency this must be decided 
democratically through a process of consultations both within the 
coalition and within the opposition i am not striving for this 
office in the way known and typical in the west im putting myself 
at the disposal of those forces which i represent politically 
whether they decide this is the optimal solution i will also 
seriously consider the stand of the opposition understanding that 
the president especially in our conditions when we have to unite 
the nations efforts and build platforms of accord should have at 
least a minimum of support from all sides thats why i approach 
this problem with complete seriousness with a feeling of 
responsibility after all i am a soldier so i have an deeprooted 
feeling of duty but also of honor i will not crawl to this post

what i regret is not that martial law was imposed but that the 
situation came about in which the implementation of martial law 
appeared necessary thats why it was such a difficult and dramatic 
decision and for me personally very painful 
it was forgotten or some people didnt want to know what 
efforts i made before the declaration of martial law in order to 
avoid it 
i want to emphasize here that then and in many other cases and 
especially today i must appreciate lech walesas realism 
especially today when i see him as a man who has developed his 
political possibilities very much and who approaches the tasks 
that his movement is facing with a great feeling of responsibility 
looking at it from a certain distance today i dont want to 
blame the opposition alone we were somehow not mature there was 
a lot of distrust on both sides the external situation was 
unfavorable eastwest relations had deteriorated and as you 
know the situation in the east was also different then so internal 
and external conditions formed such a knot that it is difficult to 
say today whether another course of events was possible

at the communist partys 10th plenum during which it was 
decided to restore legal status to solidarity i really threw 
everything onto the scale my destiny and my dignity it would be 
the greatest drama for me if history one day said these decisions 
were wrong thats why i wish so much that the agreement that this 
pluralism passes the test in real life 
it is a great opportunity one can add that the situation has 
never been this favorable for us for improving eastwest relations 
with poland as a bridge i am not saying this out of a polish 
megalomania but ours is a nation of nearly 40 million people in the 
center of europe which is on one hand strongly rooted in the east 
politically and economically but on the other hand very strongly 
rooted in the west traditionally and culturally and of course 
there are millions of people of polish descent living outside 
poland which is also important 
we also have a very good situation in that there is perestroika 
and that our polish experiment is in a sense in the avantgarde of 
these reforms it gives us a strong position within this system and 
gives us a full feeling of independence and sovereignty in solving 
our problems 
it remains to be seen to what extent we are successful in 
implementing difficult economic reforms which require a degree of 
public acceptance and support because these reforms are painful 
like every surgery that is expected to bring health when there are 
only anesthetics after some time the illness returns even more 
strongly when its only a bandage placed on a sore then of course 
the results are only partial like we have had so far 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we have been making very bold economic reforms for several years 
now and they were authentic reforms as evaluated by western 
experts but the realization of the reforms is partial the 
reason is that we cannot obtain societys acceptance for their depth 
and severity i can understand that its hard for the people but 
this understanding is probably possible only when all main political 
forces address society with this these main political forces 
sat at a common table will be in a common parliament and if they 
find common language for this topic this is the chance 
im a very cautious optimist if i didnt believe that the 
reforms might bring success i wouldnt know what to live for 
unfortunately there is a historically rooted tendency in our 
society to martyrdom to some waiting for changes maybe with 
insufficient activity aimed at changing ones destiny but at the 
same time this is a nation capable of great deeds great sacrifices 
and great heroism if we succeed in building an awareness that 
heroism in time of peace is necessary today then this nation can 
achieve whatever it wants this is a great formidable nation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i understand that by expressing the will to visit the 
president wants to show his appreciation of the reforms that are 
taking place here both in word which is good and very 
desirable and also in a more sensible way especially in the 
economic sense we dont want gifts or some kind of charity we know 
that it is a matter which must be balanced by mutual benefits 
we also know that the great united states not only offers 
possibilities in this area but also that its voice may be decisive 
in the western community many of the problems mired today may move 
much more quickly with friendly american support these include the 
problems of our indebtedneess and different questions connected 
with that it seems that the president could do a lot in this sphere

the government may have given up on drilling the 
queens english into the skulls of englands young but the queens 
son has not 
all the nonsense these academics come up with prince charles 
fumed following a recent report that urges teachers to respect we 
was and other nonstandard expressions as objects of interest 
and value 
all the people i have in my office they cant speak english 
properly they cant write english properly all the letters sent 
from my office i have to correct myself and that is because english 
is taught so bloody badly the prince said wednesday at a seminar 
launching the foundation for educationbusiness partnerships 
if we want people who write good english and write plays for 
the future there is no way they can do it with the present system 
it is a fundamental problem we must educate for character he 
said 
reaction thursday was mixed as is usually the case when charles 
ventures into controversial areas the 40yearold prince is the 
product of the uppercrust private schools that are known here as 
public schools and his use of the swearword bloody drew 
particular attention 
if he has to swear he is proving that the public schools are 
as bad as the state ones retorted nigel de gruchy general 
secretaryelect of the national association of schoolmastersunion 
of women teachers 
the royal prerogative seems to mean ignoring all the evidence 
more children now pass more exams than ever before he probably 
doesnt pay enough to attract the right quality of staff to write 
his letters 
the conservative evening standard under the headline bloody 
bad form thought it unfair of charles publicly to criticize his 
own staff but said he was right to attack teaching standards 
added the leftleaning daily mirror parodying london plebspeak 
charlie might have bin a bit out of order but clitches from 
teachers is worse than bad spelling from secretaries innit 
doug mcevoy deputy general secretary of the national union of 
teachers said the prince has not received the benefits of a state 
education 
to motivate children you have to make lessons exciting and 
interesting and you do not do that by teaching grammar by rote 
mcevoy said 
that was the line taken by the governments working party on 
english teaching chaired by professor brian cox of manchester 
university 
if prince charles read our report and not just newspaper 
reports about it he would find there was much he agreed with cox 
said 
the groups report released last week concluded that 
grammatical drills and sentence parsing have come to be recognized 
as being mostly mechanical and uninteresting 
as for constructions such as we was he aint she come 
here yesterday and they never saw nobody the report urged 
tolerance 
there is little point in correcting the spoken language of 
pupils in any general way because it is unlikely to have a 
beneficial effect against the pressures of home and peer group 
teachers can have little hope of changing how pupils speak the 
report said 
if teachers concentrate on pupils competence in written 
standard english pupils will gain sufficient knowledge of standard 
english to be able to convert this into competence in spoken 
standard english when appropriate 
the daily telegraph twitted this conclusion with the headline 
english as she is spoke receives a good report 
teaching unions my foot snorted the princes 80yearold 
former headmaster col stuart townsend 
the prince would make a damned good minister of education 
townsend said the whole point is that this is england english is 
our language and everyone who lives here should be able to 
communicate in english not only in reading and writing but in 
speech 
the report appeared last year but was revised following a long 
wrangle over the place of grammar in the curriculum education 
secretary kenneth baker had complained that grammar was not 
sufficiently stressed in the first report he says the revised 
version is acceptable 
prince charles echoes the concern of many parents baker 
said that is why we are introducing a national curriculum with 
english as the core subject we have already set out standards for 
7yearolds which focus on reading writing speaking grammar 
spelling and punctuation high standards begin in primary schools

national flags command far less reverence in europe 
than in the united states and president bushs proposal to outlaw 
burning the stars and stripes has drawn mixed reactions 
flag scholars in france and belgium think bushs idea is a good 
one but in britain and ireland they are less enthusiastic 
a west german said he understands the sentiment in the united 
states because patriotic feeling is very much more alive there 
than in the european countries 
an italian law provides prison terms of one to three years for 
insulting italian or foreign flags but scholars say they are not 
aware of other laws specifically protecting european flags 
offenders in west germany can be prosecuted under broader 
legislation protecting cultural religious and political symbols 
in france a few prosecutions have been brought when flags on 
public buildings were harmed but there is nothing to prevent 
citizens burning the tricolor in the backyard said lucien philippe 
a french vexillologist as flag experts are known 
he supports what bush is trying to do if the flag is a 
national symbol that is honored in all ceremonies i think it 
follows logically that it should be protected by a law philippe 
said in an interview that is normal 
roger baert of the belgian flag society said he thought a law was 
necessary to protect a sacred idea 
in england william crampton director of the flag institute 
said bush risked going down a very thorny road his irish 
counterpart seamus obrogain said bush was trying to enforce an 
outward show of respect for symbols of state which i think should 
be voluntary 
arnold rabbow a west german vexillologist who has visited the 
united states said he found americans far more respectful to the 
flag than europeans 
he said there have been occasional attempts to prosecute 
satirists for debasing the west german flag but the defendants 
mostly argued freedom of the arts and the courts generally saw it 
the same way 
old glory has remained constant through us history except for 
the number and pattern of the stars but european flags have changed 
with wars or political upheaval 
germany is a prime example of how a nations banner can reflect a 
turbulent history 
it has changed four times since 1848 shifting among republican 
imperial and nazi colors today both germanies fly the black red 
and yellow tricolor with east germany adding a hammer a drawing 
compass and a sheaf of wheat 
changes of regime or state ideology often find their first 
expression in alterations of the national flag 
irans flag since 1979 has featured the arabic words for god is 
great 22 times signifying the moslem calendar date when ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini returned to iran after shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
was overthrown 
britains union jack combines the flags of scotland england and 
preindependence ireland in a design that often leads to it being 
displayed upside down by mistake 
the union jack still figures in the flags of some former british 
colonies that now belong to the commonwealth as well as that of 
south africa which has left the commonwealth it also is prominent 
in the state flag of hawaii 
british attitudes toward the union jack often border on the 
cavalier the flag shows up in clothing shopping bags and sun hats 
and frequently appears on company logos no rules or guidelines 
govern the dimensions or mode of display 
crampton says he would like such a code introduced but only on a 
voluntary basis 
he believes europeans are more relaxed about their flags because 
many countries still have royal families as objects of national 
sentiment 
obrogain said americans revere their flag with the same sort 
of superstition that europeans revere the monarchy 
in britain far more headlines are generated by members of 
parliament who mishandle the mace the royal symbol in the 
legislative chamber than by the occasional flag abuser 
crampton thinks that may gradually change 
we are becoming more nervous about the flag he said we 
see britain shrinking as a world power and we feel perhaps a need to 
turn to our core symbols more people want to fly it than in the 
past and flag makers report sales have boomed in recent years

ethnic tensions often spurred by 
years of hatred and mistrust are rising at a time when politicians 
longingly speak of a common european home linking east and west 
the causes of the strained relations are complex often involving 
land religion economics or political freedom and are sometimes 
part of a legacy of countries carved out after world war i 
tens of thousands of ethnic turks are fleeing bulgaria baltic 
republics demand more freedom from moscow and italians resent the 
germanspeaking minority in the mountainous north 
in the soviet union some of the most bitterly contested ethnic 
unrest has hit central asia 
while the disputes stem from such different causes that 
comparisons are difficult the overall picture is dramatic 
a flow of ethnic turkish refugees has been heading south from 
bulgaria into turkey and un officials in geneva say the number is 
likely to hit 100000 by july 1 
everyone is packing his bags a huge wave of immigration is in 
the offing and hundreds of thousands may come if the rules do not 
change said mustafa ahmedov a 25yearold teacher who recently 
arrived in turkey 
the exodus sparked by bulgarias forced assimilation program for 
the approximately 1 million ethnic turks is bound to strain 
turkeys economy and hobble parts of bulgarias farm and factory 
production 
athens and ankara meanwhile remain at odds over the 120000 
moslems in western thrace bordering turkey officials in ankara 
insist on naming the minority turkish and periodically express 
concern the rights of the minority are being trampled 
in the mountainous alto adige province of northern italy the 
neofascist italian social movement has been picking up support from 
italian speakers resentful of the germanspeaking majority the area 
also has been hit by bombings blamed on proponents of separatism 
in yugoslavia the most visible of several ethnic splits is the 
struggle between serbs and ethnic albanians in the southern province 
of kosovo 
more than a halfmillion serbs rallied in the provincial capital 
of pristina on wednesday to mark the 600th anniversary of the battle 
of kosovo increasing tensions between the two sides the 1389 
battle sparked the serbs centurieslong fight against islam 
serbias drive to regain more control over its province led to 
rioting by ethnic albanians in march that killed 25 people in bloody 
clashes with security forces 
romania under president nicolae ceausescu is trying to 
eradicate separate ethnic minorities leading thousands of ethnic 
hungarians to seek asyslum 
still each ethnic conflict has its own roots often heightened 
by different religions and economic imbalances 
we cant just lump together the meskhi turks in uzbekistan 
northern ireland and the germans in northern italy says waltraud 
kokot an ethnologist at the university of cologne 
we have to understand the conflicts as being restricted both in 
cultural and historical terms she said in an interview 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during a visit to west 
germany in june signed a joint declaration with chancellor helmut 
kohl that called for a common european home 
yet in his own home gorbachev must cope daily with a wide array 
of tensions that could threaten his reforms 
the restive baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania 
have kept their battles for greater independence violencefree as 
they demand more local control over their relatively welloff 
economies 
after years of tension with their german minority members soviet 
bloc countries have opened a virtual floodgate of emigration moscow 
alone let 33352 ethnic germans emigrate to west germany in the 
first five months of this year the west german interior ministry 
said 
seeking ways to stem the flow the soviet union is considering 
the possible establishment of an autonomous ethnic german settlement 
parts of the soviet union have been wracked by ethnic violence 
people have been killed and injured in riots in the central asian 
republic of kazakhstan 
the june 1720 riots were in the oil production center of novy 
uzen between kazakhs and settlers from the caucasus mountains 
region native kazakhs complain the settlers dominate oil industry 
jobs and receive preferential treatment in housing and other 
benefits 
earlier in june a wave of murder and arson swept the fergana 
valley region of uzbekistan another predominantly moslem central 
asian republic 
rioters there fixed on another ethnic minority this time the 
meskhi turks who had been deported to the area from their homeland 
in georgia by josef stalin in 1944 about 100 people died in the 
fergana valley unrest 
both cases of central asian violence came against a background of 
poverty and unemployment in regions whose crops and industries have 
long been dictated by moscow 
on sunday georgians and azerbaijanis clashed in soviet georgia 
and five people were wounded a news editor in the southern republic 
said 
in april 20 people were killed in the georgian capital of 
tbilisi when troops were called in to quell a prodemocracy

oregon doesnt have a national football league 
team but it may soon become the only state in the nation to offer a 
lottery game based on the point spreads of nfl games 
nfl commissioner pete rozelle is threatening legal action saying 
such a betting game would harm the integrity of professional 
football 
boosters of the game say it would tap a new audience for the 
oregon lottery and could be used to raise money for college sports 
programs 
gov neil goldschmidt initially said he shared rozelles concerns 
about the game which for a 1 investment would allow players to 
predict the outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly nfl games 
against the point spread 
this week however goldschmidt said that after discussing the 
game with lottery officials hes warming up to the idea 
im not saying i would prefer to do what it is theyre 
proposing but my comfort level is slightly higher than it was 
the governor said at a news conference tuesday 
goldschmidt has said he supports a bill pending in the 
legislature calling on the lottery to create a new game to generate 
up to 9 million a year for oregon intercollegiate sports in 
general proceeds from the oregon lottery are used for economic 
development programs which can ben anything from a current prison 
construction program to local sewer improvements 
oregon lottery director jim davey hopes to use the nfl betting 
game for the college sports fund although hes drawing up a list of 
possible alternatives 
new games must be approved by the fivemember lottery commission 
which can act without the governors approval although the members 
and davey are appointed by the governor and serve at his pleasure 
the commission members are considering meeting in the next two 
weeks and have said they support the proposal chairman debbs potts 
said earlier this week that he hoped the commission would approve 
the game 
under the lotterys proposal players would try to predict the 
outcome of four to 14 games against the point spreads set by nevada 
casino oddsmakers the more games they bet the more money they 
could win from about 8 for a perfect fourgame card to about 
8000 for a perfect 14game card 
though oregons lottery is small by national standards 150 
million in annual sales the football betting game proposal is 
viewed by the nfl with genuine alarm rozelle said in a recent 
letter to goldschmidt 
the nfl chief said linking a lottery game to the outcome of nfl 
games would jeopardize the publics confidence that every player was 
doing his best and that referees were calling plays as they see them 
it could change the fundamental character of fan interest in 
the game league spokesman jim heffernan said in a telephone 
interview from nfl headquarters in new york they would not be 
concerned about who won the games but by how many points a team 
wins 
davey said people already bet millions of dollars each year on 
nfl games whether legally in nevada or through bookies and office 
pools elsewhere 
its already happening and all were doing is tapping into 
that market the lottery director said 
heffernan argues however that theres no comparison between the 
longestablished legalized gambling in nevada and proposals 
elsewhere to base lotteries on nfl games 
its already on the books in nevada he said the national 
football league cant repeal a law in nevada but certainly with 
something thats not on the books we can voice our opinion 
the league might sue oregon if the state goes ahead with a 
football lottery game heffernan said 
the league took the state of delaware to court when that state 
tried a football betting game but the lawsuit became moot after 
delaware gave up its game after one season in 1974 because it lost 
money

month twenty top managers split 30 percent of the buyout the 
average bluecollar worker found 60000 in his post office box 
some executives got millions 
on a percapita basis this is probably the richest community 
in the state of michigan white pine grade school teacher and 
township supervisor pete rigoni said recently over a cup of coffee 
and a plate of eggs 
only a few years ago such a notion would have seemed like 
chasing rainbows to white pines 1000 residents 
copper range was spending more than 1 to mine a pound of copper 
cathode that was worth only 60 cents on the market employment 
dropped from 3140 in 1974 to a few hundred the miners struck and 
echo bay mines ltd of canada closed copper range in 1985 
echo bay was days some say hours away from shutting off the 
pumps that kept copper ranges tunnels from flooding when the 
workers government agencies and a trio of corporate managers pulled 
off the buyout 
four years of employee ownership and a selfimposed wage cut from 
12 an hour to 850 dropped the production cost to 75 cents per 
pound in the same span copper prices have more than doubled 
copper range in december issued employeeowners their first 
profitsharing checks 
by saving the mine the workers have saved white pine a twisting 
subdivision of lawns and splitlevels that seem out of place so deep 
in the north woods there is no downtown only a companybuilt mall 
across the highway from the mine gate a giant smokestack stands 
like a totem over town and spits out things that make the morning 
fog taste like electrolyte 
if you dont mine copper in white pine you probably cut trees 
but lately white pine has been home to more than lumberjacks and 
miners 
investment brokers from all over the midwest have swarmed this 
tiny community below the porcupine mountains the konteka hotel has 
hosted 42 investment seminars and more are scheduled an employee 
said 
theres 83 million up for grabs and they all want their fare 
share said copper range personnel director larry chabot as of 
early june chabot had been contacted by 39 brokers and thats 
enough 
the miners bear with the outoftowners like a dog wears fleas 
we asked around if they wanted us to hold our own investment 
workshop said tom strong president of the citizens state bank 
in nearby ontonagon they said geez not another seminar 
strongs bank left the seminars to the outsiders and is relying 
on other ways to keep some of the miners millions in michigan 
if you deposit here your community grows strong said 
thursday if you deposit outside the community somebody elses 
town grows 
local bank deposits have swelled by as much as 30 percent but 
strong said much of the money is in temporary accounts while miners 
use a 60day federal grace period to find the right tax shelters 
any unsheltered money will be subject to a 30 percent tax rate 
mrs sporleder a copper range security worker bypassed the 
brokers and spent some of her buyout booty to pay off all of her 
bills then she and husband george drove to nearby bessemer and 
drove home in their shiny nash 
just to think you dont owe anybody its wonderful she 
said it makes you think well have a future for at least another 
four years 
metall has promised shareholders another 15 million if they meet 
production and profit targets the next four years union 
representatives say the goals can be reached if the price of copper 
stays up

the university of utah and general electric 
have reached an agreement under which four ge scientists will study 
the schools purported breakthrough in cold nuclear fusion 
the collaboration announced wednesday is the first such 
agreement the university has made with a major corporation said 
james brophy the schools vice president for research 
this is the first time that any private corporation has 
revealed what its doing in cold fusion and general electric 
which of course is an outstanding company is doing it with the 
university of utah brophy said 
the agreement is not exclusive allowing the university to make 
similar arrangements with others and does not provide any seed 
money to the school for research 
on march 23 university of utah chemist b stanley pons and a 
british colleague martin fleischmann announced they had sustained 
roomtemperature nuclear fusion in an experiment using rods of 
palladium inside coils of platinum immersed in electrically charged 
deuteriumrich heavy water 
pons and fleischmann maintain the experiment yields more than 100 
times the energy needed to produce it researchers around the world 
have duplicated portions of their experiment but proof of nuclear 
fusion has remained elusive 
hugo rossi director of the u of us solidstate research 
efforts said three of the general electric scientists will be based 
in companys headquarters in schenectady ny 
a fourth a thermodynamicist arrived in salt lake city on monday 
to begin working with researchers at the universitys fusion 
laboratories under terms of the agreement utah scientists also 
will use ges laboratories 
rossi said ge scientists have come to the university on a regular 
basis to visit pons fusion laboratories 
they have carefully studied and worked with pons on all the raw 
data and conversion into conclusions he said they dont feel 
completely satisfied with all of the claims of pons and fleischmann 
there are some points that are going to require further research 
but they are satisfied enough to feel that something genuine is 
going on and its worth their further investigation rossi said

queen elizabeth ii experienced again some of the 
frightening sights and sounds of her youth during world war ii 
the 63yearold monarch whose buckingham palace home was bombed 
in 1940 visited a new sight and sound exhibit thursday at the 
redeveloped imperial war museum in south london 
officials said the queen was known not to like loud bangs so the 
noise was toned down when she visited a recreated brickbuilt 
shelter like those in which britons took refuge during the raids in 
194042 
in the blitz experience the museum uses wartime recordings 
of bombers overhead explosions and sirens combined with voices in 
conversation singing and screaming and the smell of smoke to give 
visitors a taste of what it felt like to live through a raid during 
the german bombardment of londons east end

researchers reported evidence today that a gene 
that affects diseasefighting white blood cells may help make people 
susceptible to multiple sclerosis 
if the gene is abnormal it may prime the cells to attack normal 
nerve tissue rather than germs 
the new finding will make no immediate difference in therapy but 
scientists should be able to develop better treatments as they learn 
more details about what causes the disease said study coauthor 
stephen hauser 
hauser director of the neuroimmunology unit at massachusetts 
general hospital in boston reports the findings in todays issue of 
the journal cell with colleagues at the hospital and the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
a study published earlier this year also implicated the gene in 
the disease 
an estimated 250000 americans have multiple sclerosis an often 
crippling condition that can produce weakness difficulty in 
coordination dizziness and loss of balance scientists have long 
known that genes play some role in making people susceptible 
the disease occurs when the body for unknown reasons attacks 
nerve tissue research has suggested that white blood cells called 
tcells play a critical role in the onslaught 
as part of the immune system tcells normally fight invading 
germs but perhaps they attack nerve tissue instead if something 
goes wrong with their mechanism for choosing targets researchers 
say 
that mechanism involves a structure on the cell surface called a 
receptor so hauser and his colleagues decided to study a gene that 
helps determine the architecture of the receptor 
each person carries two versions of the receptor gene one 
inherited from each parent the new study found that siblings who 
both had the disease also tended to inherit the same versions of the 
gene from their parents 
that occurred in 15 out of 40 sibling pairs studied while only 
10 pairs would be expected to share both parental versions just by 
chance 
only three pairs of sibling patients shared neither version far 
fewer than the 10 pairs one would expect by chance 
in contrast multiple sclerosis patients shared the same versions 
with their healthy brothers or sisters only about as often as one 
would expect by chance 
researchers also found evidence that the gene affected 
susceptibility in 17 families with only one multiple sclerosis 
patient so it may play a role in sporadic cases hauser said 
calculations showed the gene is not the only determinant of 
susceptibility other genes and nongenetic factors also appear to 
be involved hauser said in a telephone interview 
stephen reingold vice president for research and medical 
programs at the national multiple sclerosis society called the work 
part of the puzzle of understanding genetic factors behind the 
disease 
once those factors are better understood patients who want to 
have children may be able to get better counseling about the risk of 
passing on susceptibility to the disease he said 
the new finding is encouraging because it strengthens evidence 
that the tcell receptor affects susceptibility said henry 
mcfarland deputy chief of the neuroimmunology branch at the 
national institute of neurological disorders and stroke

beaches from the chic riviera to the english 
channel are beginning to be hit by the same blight that reached 
american shores last summer syringes 
the needle refuse dropped by drug users on european shores hasnt 
been as putrid as the waste and blood some of it aidsinfected 
that washed up on the east coast 
no one for example is reported to have contracted any disease 
from the needles but french british and spanish children have been 
pricked and as the number of discarded needles increases concern 
is growing over what a british newspaper calls the syringe peril 
were very concerned for children children are going to be 
digging in the sand far more than adults said peter green 
medical officer for the south coast district of torbay where five 
people have been treated the last month for needle injuries 
the syringes have been found near what looked like burnedout 
fires and from what we deduce these are from late night drug 
parties green said these people are highrisk we regard 
their equipment as potentially dangerous 
in neighboring exmouth district five needles were found in the 
last month although no one has been hurt 
european officials see no cause for panic or closing beaches 
they are counting on public vigilance and extra cleaning 
torbay authorities asked owners of metal detectors for help 
while one french mayor hopes to keep addicts from nighttime forays 
onto the sand 
brian hayes a painter who was scratched by a needle on a devon 
beach near salcombe agrees that beaches should remain open 
its not a question of scaremongering he says explaining 
why he called a local radio station to tell of his plight people 
have to be careful where they sit and step if i can sit on one 
anyone can 
on the french riviera a 7yearold boy was pricked in 
fashionable cannes and a 3yearold girl was hurt at cap dail in 
june another child was injured several months ago on a spanish 
beach 
manuel carballo a physician from the genevabased world health 
organizations global program on aids partly blames changes in 
drugtaking methods 
if you are seeing more druginjecting equipment disposed of 
casually it is because there are more drug injectors around doing 
this carballo said injecting as opposed to smoking chewing 
or sniffing has increased 
although no needles have turned up on italian beaches they 
litter some streets in 1988 milan sanitation workers collected up 
to 4000 syringes a day 
carballo said the availability of syringes reflects the greater 
use of disposable medical equipment a factor in the appearance of 
medical waste off american shores 
he and others say that hepatitis b with a virus more hardy than 
the hiv virus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
is probably the more likely menace from the needles although 
nothing can be ruled out 
in response to the problem early morning cleaners in cannes and 
other riviera cities were asked to redouble their efforts some 
workers were given special gloves or pincers 
we recommend that people use sandals or beach shoes said 
green 
he said that if pricked people are sent to a hospital for a 
serum and vaccination against hepatitis b 
mayor jacques medecin of nice promised to try to dislodge those 
who sleep or party on beaches were looking how to do it he 
said it could be by spraying water on them all night 
but catching them may prove as difficult as finding needles in 
the sand say officials 
if people are caught doing this we can prosecute them said 
devon county spokesman brian brady referring to a 1974 pollution 
act that calls for up to five years in prison and unlimited fines 
for those who dispose of pharmaceutical waste illegally 
its catching them thats the difficulty brady said

bob boilard likes nothing better than 
using president bush as a guinea pig for his homemade fishing lures 
i make lures for myself and i make him my official 
tester boilard said as he worked to scout out the local bluefish 
in preparation for the presidents long holiday weekend beginning 
today 
in an interview at his nearby biddeford home the 64yearold 
retired navy man said he made a string of mackerel flies to give the 
president over the weekend while bush is at his oceanfront home 
ill say good luck if we dont catch anything well get rid 
of them boilard said 
he showed off a variety of lures some made from old spoons and 
forks and said youre seeing some of the stuff the presidents 
going to fish with 
and how well does the president fish 
you wouldnt put him in the class of the bass masters or what 
have you although hes been down there with the bass people and 
thats mostly what his fishing was prior to this saltwater 
involvement boilard said 
but oh yes hes attentive and hes got the patience a lot 
of people say he hasnt got the patience but i know 
one problem boilard has encountered while fishing with bush has 
been the disruptive presence of secret service agents in other 
boats but he finally persuaded bush to lessen the interference by 
getting the agents to stay off to the side instead of traveling in 
the wake of bushs boat 
boilard said he met bush accidentally near the saco river in 
1983 not long after he retired as a mechanic at the nearby 
portsmouth naval shipyard 
we met in the ocean boilard recalled i was fishing out at 
wood island out there at the mouth of the river and i was just 
minding my business 
i didnt notice anyone else around and i heard a voice behind 
me and i was playing a bluefish at the time and i heard this 
voice behind me what are you catching them on please oh please 
what are you catching them on i turned around and said oh my 
gosh 
after comparing lures for a few moments boilard told bush then 
vice president to follow him for a good fishing spot 
so we took off and went 100 yards 150 yards i was king of 
the heap 
boilard recalls that bush gave him his private phone number at 
the family estate in walkers point and asked him to call with 
fishing tips 
since then they have been fishing when they can and exchanging 
letters when theyre unable to fish 
in one letter to boilard dated feb 24 1988 bush wrote 
dear bob articles on both blues and mackerels made me think of 
you it was great seeing you in new hampshire bob im going to 
win but ill promise you one thing it wont affect our fishing 
together 
but boilard acknowledges bush doesnt always have a lot of time 
for fishing 
you know the hardest thing in the world is to get that guy out 
there for some time to be able to fish to do the fishing

a middleaged man slaughters his cattle and cuts down his banana 
trees before hanging himself 
and a father wraps his sons hands in kerosenesoaked rags before 
setting them afire because he suspected the 10yearold of stealing 
20 shillings the equivalent of 1 
such violence is increasingly common in this east african nation

rapid social changes for the tales of destruction mutilation and 
death that appear regularly in local newspapers 
the traditional underpinnings of this tribalbased society are 
being eroded these experts say as young men migrate to cities 
where jobs are rare and as relationships based on money suffuse a 
rural society ruled only a generation ago by kinship 
its a whole question of adjustment to dramatic change said 
philista onyanga a sociologist at the university of nairobi 
were talking about change within a generation urbanization and 
moving to a moneybased society it used to be that authority was 
based purely on age and gender 
in the new kenya respected relatives and village elders are less 
likely to be consulted by or even be available to men and women 
feeling overwhelmed by poverty and family problems old folklore 
provides few answers to those under new kinds of stress 
the result is a society less able to cope with rising prices too 
few jobs too little land and increasingly elusive educational 
opportunities say onyanga and others 
probably the most important support system to deteriorate has 
been the local group of aunts uncles grandparents parents 
cousins and siblings who provided emotional physical and financial 
support 
the extended family system has been the basis of security 
traditionally in this country throughout generations said sam 
gatere a psychologist he said its disintegration has left people 
feeling very insecure 
my father if he did not have a job knew that his brother 
would take care of him said gatere today not at all now its 
everyone for himself 
men have left rural areas in search of salaried work in the 
cities leaving the women to fend for themselves and their families 
run the farm and see to community matters traditionally dealt with 
by the man 
that straight away means the family dynamics change the head 
of the family shifts from the man to the wife this is most strange 
for africa said gatere who produces a nationally broadcast radio 
show on social problems 
university education traditionally seen as a way to get off the 
farm and into a salaried position is becoming increasingly 
expensive and with a population expected to double in the next 16 
years an education no longer provides the promise of a better life 
it once did 
to accomodate the number of potential wage earners entering the 
marketplace kenya says it would have to create 65 million jobs by 
the turn of the century nearly twice the current number 
now education means nothing because of the population boom 
said onyanga the situation is very frustrating when the 
uneducated father finally gets his kids to school they end up 
without a job 
stagnant salaries and rising prices add their own stresses 
the coffee picker who loses his job and kills his family then 
himself sees no other alternative he has no home and no one will 
care for him said gatere 
they end up so frustrated they feel there is no reason to 
live said mbogori

a florida senator is calling for a suspension 
of us talks with the palestine liberation organization after two 
secret meetings between the bush administration and chairman yasser 
arafats secondincommand 
and israel is registering regret and disappointment ambassador 
moshe arad called at the state department thursday to say plo 
terrorism is escalating and that the us move has hurt chances for 
holding palestinian elections 
sen connie mack rfla asked secretary of state james a baker 
iii in a letter to suspend all contact with the plo until congress 
can review the development in hearings and in committees 
it is incomprehensible to me that the administration would 
escalate its contacts with the plo without any consultation with 
congress or any improvement in plo behavior mack said 
while the senator said the bush administration had upgraded its 
contacts state department officials said the two meetings did not 
reflect a change in policy 
the state department confirmed that robert pelletreau the us 
ambassador to tunisia met twice with salah khalaf known also as 
abu iyad who is arafats security chief there was no immediate 
word on the outcome of the meetings 
officials said the purpose was to explore prospects for holding 
elections among the 14 million palestinian arabs who live under 
israeli control on the west bank and in gaza 
but arad called on assistant secretary of state john kelly to 
reinforce his governments opposition to the usplo dialogue 
which the reagan administration opened last december after arafat 
publicly renounced terrorism and acknowledged israels right to 
exist 
the meetings were confirmed by the state department only after 
they were disclosed by khalaf in an interview with the kuwaiti news 
agency kuna 
according to a state department document terrorist group 
profiles the fatah faction of the plo of which khalaf is a senior 
official rejects the 1978 camp david accords which produced a 
peace treaty between israel and egypt in 1979 
its political objective the document says is establishment of 
an independent secular palestinian state originally committed to 
recapturing all of palestine but now it may accept a state based 
on a gazawest bank formulation the description of fatah said 
a state department spokesman adam shub and other us officials 
said pelletreaus two meetings with khalaf did not reflect any 
change in us policy 
ambassador pelletreau is our authorized channel for conducting 
the us dialogue with the plo and as such he may meet with plo 
officials shub said 
officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity said one of 
the meetings was held monday and the other on an earlier occasion 
the decision by former president reagan and former secretary of 
state george p shultz ended a 14year ban on us policy talks and 
negotiations with the plo that had been part of an agreement in 
which israel gave up land in the sinai it had won from egypt in the 
1967 sixday war 
israel disapproved of the us move richard w murphy the 
assistant secretary of state for the near east offered assurances 
the dialogue would be suspended if the plo engaged in terrorism 
in a number of incidents since then israel has accused plo 
factions of terrorism the state department cautioned the plo but 
kept talking

gasoline prices on the fourth of july weekend 
are stable for the first time since the alaska oil spill in march 
but officials in many states are still pressing oil companies to 
prove they didnt use the spill to gouge consumers 
attorneys general in several states are investigating whether oil 
refiners conspired to use the market turmoil caused by the exxon 
tanker wreck to force higher prices on gasoline wholesalers thus 
triggering big increases at the pump 
the industry says its not to blame and some say the charges are 
inspired by politics yet the oil companies are facing a level of 
public suspicion about gasoline price collusion not seen in this 
country since the oil crises of the 1970s 
there was something very special about this leap in prices it 
was the fastest and greatest increase in the history of the united 
states said trilby lundberg of the los angelesbased lundberg 
survey which tracks gasoline prices 
the national average retail price started the year at 98 cents a 
gallon and stood at 1 a week before the march 24 spill according 
to the lundberg survey two months later the price peaked at 118 a 
gallon and throughout june it hovered around 117 
the energy department says the spill cut supplies of alaskan 
crude oil by 13 million barrels over 13 days not enough alone to 
cause a major jump in gasoline prices 
the industry contends the price runup was caused by many factors 
outside its direct control including normal seasonal increases in 
gasoline demand higher prices for the crude oil used to make 
gasoline and tougher environmental standards for gasoline that 
increased manufacturing costs 
none of the state investigations apparently has produced 
conclusive evidence of wrongdoing even so some state officials 
have publicly accused the companies of manipulation 
greed and collusion are the only apparent explanations for 
these unwarranted price increases gray davis the california 
state controller told a us senate hearing last april 
joseph koach executive director of the service station dealers 
of america said in an interview that the legality or fairness of 
gasoline pricing cant be determined because of a lack of public 
information about refiner costs 
we just cant prove theres collusion we cant prove theres 
price fixing he said 
davis and other state officials plus some us senators have 
called on the justice department to investigate but it has not 
indicated it will take up the matter the federal trade commission 
refused requests to investigate 
a trade group of station dealers in washington state is launching 
a statewide petition drive over the independence day weekend seeking 
a law that would place oil refiners and their prices under state 
public utility controls 
the main organizer tim hamilton said he believed public anger 
at the oil companies is great enough that he can get the 150000 
signatures he needs to place his proposal on the general election 
ballot in november 1990 
in may officials from the attorney general offices of seven 
states washington oregon california idaho north dakota alaska 
and indiana met with oil company officials to investigate the 
reasons for the sudden price increases 
those officials expressed concern about possible collusion but 
said more information was needed before they could reach a firm 
conclusion 
massachusetts is conducting its own investigation and earlier 
this week the georgia house research office issued a report that 
pointed to increased profittaking by oil refiners as a reason for 
the gasoline price surge last spring

the muchcriticized practice of dual trading 
where brokers trade for themselves and their customers would be 
restricted on the nations major futures exchanges under legislation 
proposed by the chairman of a house subcommittee 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the house agriculture 
subcommitee on credit said thursday he has concluded after a 
fivemonth legislative review that dual trading presents possible 
dangers and opportunity for abuse 
critics say the practice allows brokers to take care of 
themselves first at the cost of their customers however defenders 
say it helps ease market volatility when there are few customer 
orders 
the provisions on dual trading are among several changes english 
is proposing to draw tighter rein on the futures markets 
englishs bill which he said will be introduced july 11 when 
congress returns from its fourth of july recess would exempt 
futures markets trading on average fewer than 7000 contracts a day 
from the dual trading prohibition 
english also would exempt exchanges with audit systems that can 
accurately track the times of trades to the nearest 30second 
interval an accurate audit system by comparing times and prices of 
trades allows investigators to determine whether or not brokers are 
abusing dual trading 
his bill would require exchanges to produce within a year audit 
trails accurate to the closest minute and to produce within three 
years audits accurate to the nearest 30 seconds 
englishs subcommittee began an investigation of dual trading in 
response to revelations in january of an undercover fbi probe of 
alleged abuses by as many as 100 traders in the nations two largest 
futures markets the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
english also would give the commodity futures trading commission 
which regulates the futures markets power to conduct undercover 
probes 
allowing that kind of surveillance tells the american public 
that there are watchful eyes cast upon practices and activities 
which might in the past have gone unnoticed he said 
his reform proposals are being incorporated into legislation 
reauthorizing the cftc without the bill the agencys legislative 
permission to operate would expire sept 30 
the senate agriculture committee is also reviewing the agency 
but a spokesman for committee chairman sen patrick leahy dvt 
said the panel doesnt plan to act until after the completion this 
summer of a report by the general accounting office 
other changes proposed by english would 
protect customers from highpressure telephone sales pitches by 
providing a threeday cooling off period before customers opening 
accounts by phone can begin trading 
require futures exchanges to put on their governing boards more 
directors without direct ties to the exchanges and trading firms 
force new futures traders to attend ethics training sessions and 
participate in refresher courses 
the futures industry association endorsed englishs proposals 
the congressman said he will hold hearings on the bill during the 
week of july 17 with a subcommittee vote to follow

wojciech jaruzelski will be remembered as 
the general who imposed martial law to suppress the independent 
solidarity movement but he may also be recalled as the leader of 
polands shift toward democracy 
ramrod straight and often seemingly remote behind dark glasses 
and a brace of military medals jaruzelski has presided over two of 
polands most dramatic and divergent periods 
born july 6 1923 to an aristocratic family in an eastern polish 
village jaruzelski was attending a catholic boarding school in 
warsaw when world war ii broke out 
his official biography says he stayed in the northeastern 
territories of the soviet union employed as a laborer during the 
war 
but poles who know the family have said they were caught by the 
soviet occupiers and moved to siberia where jaruzelski was a 
bakers apprentice and his father felled logs in a labor camp until 
his death 
in 1943 jaruzelski entered a soviet officer training school and 
then served with the communistled polish first army which formed 
on russian territory and advanced with the red army against the 
nazis 
a member of polands communist party since 1947 he was promoted 
through the military ranks until he was named defense minister in 
1968 
in october 1981 as the euphoria and defiance of the solidarity 
movement gripped poland jaruzelski was named first secretary of the 
party the only career military officer to rise to supreme power in 
the soviet bloc 
two months later jaruzelskis dawn broadcast announced the 
military had assumed power in poland amid suggestions the martial 
law decree was needed to preempt soviet intervention 
through the 1980s even as restrictions eased jaruzelski ruled 
a dispirited poland sliding toward economic disaster 
pressed by labor unrest severe shortages and a 39 billion 
foreign debt communist authorities this year reversed course and 
suggested talks with the opposition led by solidarity which had 
never faded despite repression 
on june 4 voters in polands most democratic postwar elections 
delivered a stinging rejection of jaruzelskis communistled 
coalition 
but the atmosphere of reform has brought jaruzelski a series of 
meetings with western leaders who are moving to resume badly needed 
investments and loans that were cut off to poland after martial law

preliminary figures by the agriculture 
department show that prices farmers got for raw products in june 
dropped 2 percent from may but still averaged 5 percent more than a 
year ago 
the departments agricultural statistics board said thursday that 
lower prices for tomatoes cattle wheat and corn were mostly 
responsible for the decrease from the may average 
higher prices for lettuce hogs lemons and strawberries partly 
offset the decline for the other commodities 
the june hog price was at the highest level since august last 
year the report said cattle and calf prices were mixed all 
feed grain and oil seed prices decreased from may 
wheat prices were down while the rice price increased slightly 
lower broiler prices more than offset slight increases for eggs and 
turkeys 
department economists say net cash income of farmers is expected 
to fall 5 percent to 14 percent this year to a range of 50 billion 
to 55 billion from the 1988 record of 58 billion 
net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the 
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses cash income rose last year despite drought partly 
because of higher market prices and crops farmers had stored from 
previous harvests 
the decline this year is expected to stem from farmers larger 
cash expenses as they boost plantings and also because of lower 
federal subsidies 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda to rise an average of 4 
percent to 7 percent this year following a 41 percent increase in 
1988 
based on the preliminary figures the price index for livestock 
and livestock products declined 06 percent from may to june but 
still averaged 54 percent above the yearearlier level 
crop prices overall dropped 28 percent from may but averaged 
62 percent more than in june 1988 
the overall index of prices paid to farmers in june averaged 146 
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison down from a revised 
recordmatching 149 percent in may that was the lowest reading 
since december when the index was 145 percent 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6760 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
down from 6880 in may but still up from 65 in june 1988 those 
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4420 per 100 pounds compared with 4160 in may 
and 4710 a year earlier 
corn at 246 a bushel was down from 258 in may but was up 
from 241 in june 1988 
wheat prices at the farm averaged 378 per bushel compared 
with 401 in may and 337 a year earlier 
rice averaged 685 per 100 pounds up from 676 in may but 
well below the yearearlier level of 769 
soybeans were 7 per bushel compared with 721 in may and 
818 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 591 cents per pound up from 588 
in may but below the 62 cents of june 1988 
eggs were 633 cents per dozen compared with 62 cents in may 
and 463 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1210 per 100 pounds compared with 1220 in may and 
1130 a year earlier

agriculture department scientists say a new 
compound called amitraz has proved effective against tiny mites that 
infest the breathing tubes of honey bees 
amitraz was developed in europe and currently is approved for use 
in the united states against ticks and lice of cattle and hogs and 
against certain mites that infest pears entomologist william t 
wilson of the departments agricultural research service said 
thursday in a report by the agency 
in early tests at the agencys honey bee research laboratory in 
weslaco texas wilson found amitraz was at least 90 percent 
effective against the tracheal mite acarapis woodi 
the compound was also effective against the varroa mite another 
major bee parasite he said 
wilson said amitraz needs approval of the environmental 
protection agency before it can be marketed the only approved 
remedy now is menthol which has been effective in stemming losses 
to bee colonies but does not eradicate the mites

the department of housing and urban development 
is canceling a 500 million mortgage loan guarantee program that one 
official says is an absolute disaster 
hud secretary jack kemp ordered the troubled program canceled 
thursday as the department said the program was riddled with 
abuse 
meanwhile a house government operations subcommittee today was 
beginning review of another hud program the mortgage coinsurance 
program in which a recent inspector generals audit found lenders 
had underwritten 700 million in loans that defaulted by mid1988 
on thursday the subcommittee produced a government memo that 
links a staffer in george bushs vice presidential office to a 
project involved in alleged influencepeddling at hud 
the program canceled by kemp guarantees mortgages to finance land 
acquisition and site preparation such as street construction and 
sewer line installation for smaller developers who would include 
housing for lowincome and moderate income families in their 
projects 
twentyfive of 58 projects financed through the 12yearold title 
x land development mortgage insurance program have defaulted 
costing the government 90 million the department said 
about 500 million in loans were guaranteed since 1977 
this program was an absolute disaster said hud spokesman bob 
nipp 
kemp said application fees will be returned for projects that 
have not yet been approved projects with initial approval or with 
commitments for funds will be reviewed to determine whether fraud 
or misrepresentation warrant the denial of government insurance 
he said 
the department will publish a proposed regulation to terminate 
the program due to the enormity of the losses involved high 
patterns of abuse and the failure of the program to benefit the 
needy the departments announcement said 
the reagan administration sought legislation to abolish the 
program but was unsuccessful kemps proposed regulation must remain 
open for a period of public comment before it can become final 
president bush earlier this week accepted some responsibility for 
scandals which have surfaced alleging influencepeddling and 
mismanagement in several hud programs while he was ronald reagans 
vice president 
if you want to assign blame to the vice president for what 
happened over the past eight years ok thats fine i accept 
it said the president 
the june 1987 memo from deborah gore dean former executive 
assistant to thenhousing secretary samuel pierce detailed more 
than 2 million in funding from hud to bayamon puerto rico during 
fiscal years 1986 and 1987 
the memo was sent to tony benedi coordinator of special projects 
in the vice presidents office and provided the information per 
your request 
a bayamon project in which fred bush former deputy chief of 
staff for thenvice president bush earned 253000 as a consultant 
had been included in an inspector generals audit of huds moderate 
rehabilitation program 
fred bush was a key fundraiser for george bushs 1988 
presidential campaign but is no relation to the president 
bush who also is ambassadordesignate to luxembourg used his 
second appearance before the panel to make clarifying statements 
to the testimony he gave on may 25 
bush had testified he contacted ms dean about a project in 
bayamon after finding her name in an executive federal telephone 
directory several panel members had questioned that account 
but on thursday bush said one of his former colleagues reminded 
him that ms deans name was first raised at a social gathering when 
the colleague was talking with another former hud official hunter 
cushing 
my colleagues recollection is that mr cushing told him we 
should talk to deborah gore dean bush said 
bush said he didnt know dean so he consulted the directory 
subsequently called dean and later met with her at her office to 
discuss the project

another foreign policy success on top of his 
nato triumph awaits president bush next week in eastern europe 
unless he runs into an unexpected snag 
poland and hungary members of the warsaw pact are aching to be 
encouraged by the president to sample a few more whiffs of 
capitalism 
and who is bush to say no 
he will take with him a package of incentives carefully tied to 
good management in warsaw and budapest and then at a summit meeting 
in paris with the leaders of six other industrial democracies bush 
will urge others to provide their support as well 
the hungarians even their communist leadership are eager to 
sample western ways so are the poles and they are dragging their 
government along 
it adds up to a unique opportunity for bush for backtoback 
successes in europe 
last month at the nato summit meeting in brussels he unveiled a 
proposal for reductions of troops tanks artillery and other 
armament in europe that countered soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs bold initiatives 
apart from the public relations dividend bushs move set the 
table for the two alliances to reach an accord that would require 
far greater arms reductions by moscow than by washington 
the risk is that bush might upset the soviets but gorbachev has 
acknowledged his own economy needs an overhaul and hes offering 
his people a heady mixture of glasnost or openness and 
perestroika or restructuring 
bush said at a news conference this week that gorbachev shouldnt 
get uptight about next months trip treading carefully he said 
he would not exhort the poles or the hungarians into actions that 
could provoke repression 
considering gorbachevs own program at home and the enormous 
cost to the soviets of carrying the east european economies on their 
back the president is likely to succeed in his campaign to 
stimulate and symbolize democracy 
the soviets sent tanks into hungary in 1956 and into 
czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down reform movements 
this time around hungary and poland are following on the heels 
of soviet reform and are not dropping out of the warsaw pact 
playing it safe bush described his immediate objectives this 
way i want to see a much more open europe and i think that the 
importance of the visit is along that line its not going to be 
that were going to solve the problem of the hungarian economy or 
the polish economy 
at the heritage foundation a conservative think tank optimism 
for economic reforms in eastern europe is unbridled the 
recommendation to the white house is for an activist policy to take 
advantage of this opening 
burton yale pines the director of research said bushs trip 
could produce the first us policy for eastern europe since world 
war ii 
the united states has never had a policy toward eastern 
europe pines a former time magazine correspondent said weve 
had ad hoc responses 
earlier trips to the region by presidents richard nixon and jimmy 
carter were designed to tweak moscow pines said in the summer 
of 1989 he said the circumstances are different 
bush will visit as moscow is rethinking its role in the region 
gorbachev has offered to withdraw some troops and tanks from the 
east the natowarsaw pact negotiations in vienna could produce a 
wholesale reduction in forces 
if soviet troops really pull out you are giving a green light 
to reform pines said 
kim r holmes director of foreign policy research at heritage 
stressed the economic burden the east europeans are to moscows own 
sagging economy 
eastern europe is an economic basket case plagued with low 
productivity low motivation an increasingly obsolete industrial 
base an ecological crisis and a debt to the west of over 1 
billion he said 
according to holmes the soviets spend an estimated 21 billion 
to 30 billion a year for trade subsidies and credits and economic 
and military aid beyond what it costs moscow to maintain its 
troops in czechoslovakia east germany hungary and poland 
gorbachev may be willing to consider a partial and gradual 
disengagement from eastern europe in order to preserve the power of 
the communist party at home and to concentrate on resolving his own 
economic crisis the heritage official said

things have panned out nicely for norma 
grundys collection 
as a nurse she was no stranger to the bedpan as an 
administrator she is surrounded by them 
i came by it honestly because im a nurse ms grundy said 
you know theyre fun to look at 
ms grundy nursing director and clinic administrator of the 
mental health division at the university of california irvine has 
lined her office walls with 44 bed pans of varying sizes colors and 
composition 
some are decorated with flowers small stuffed animals and 
decoupage poems others hang bare including plastic models of the 
modern variety in red white and blue 
i have the most fantastic collection you can imagine she 
said its fun looking for them and adding to the collection 
they may be called bedpans by most people today ms grundy said 
but those who used them decades ago affectionately referred to them 
as chamber pots thunder mugs and chambers of delight 
ms grundy 58 credits her father for starting the collection 
but the display came from a colleague 
one of the psychiatrists on the staff thought my office wasnt 
bright enough and brought in an 18thcentury french chamber pot and 
that started the office decoration she said 
ms grundys collection was put to good use at a university 
chancellors retirement party four years ago when she and her 
students wore hospital gowns and body stockings while carrying the 
bedpans 
we used them for drums and we won first place for the best 
costumes she said 
many of her bedpans have come from people who knew of her 
collection 
i got one from someone who was tearing down their house and 
found it in a closet and another from a student who saw it on top 
of a trash can she said

worth of exotic fish in an illinois pet shop has returned to fort 
lauderdale and may become a meal for someone else 
terry haley an aquarium store owner from lansing ill finally 
wearied of the groupers taste for his expensive tankmates he plans 
to release his prize glutton monday in the ocean off fort lauderdale 
the name flazey a combination of fat and lazy was chosen 
in a contest for illinois schoolchildren 
the fish was a foot long and weighed 3 pounds when haley bought 
it from a fort lauderdale aquarium supplier but after 1 years of 
eating its way through the 1100gallon tank in haleys shop flazey 
measures 3 feet and weighs 35 pounds 
the grouper attracted nationwide attention in may when haley 
complained about it eating dozens of expensive fish all on top of 
its regular diet of 5 pounds of smelt every other day 
neither the shedd aquarium in chicago nor the indianapolis zoo 
wanted the fish a seafood restaurant expressed interest but haley 
did not have the heart to fillet his star attraction 
about 10 days ago flazey got its last meal from haley he put a 
drug in flazeys tank temporarily anesthetizing the fish and 
shipped him by air to noyes marine life the fort lauderdale 
aquarium supplier that sold the grouper to haley the brown spotted 
fish will stay there until haley flies down to release it 
bob stewart owner of noyes marine life said flazey seemed to be 
adjusting well haley was glad to hear that adding 
he hasnt been fed for a week to 10 days hes probably ready 
for some fish

arctic ground squirrels sleep serenely through 
alaskan winters even though their body temperatures cool to a point 
that would cause other mammals to freeze solid a researcher says in 
a study published today 
brian m barnes an assistant professor at the university of 
alaska fairbanks said thermometers surgically implanted inside 
hibernating arctic ground squirrels showed the furry animals suffer 
no ill effects from body temperatures that dip five degrees below 
the freezing point of water 
no other mammal is known to be able routinely survive such a deep 
body chill barnes said thursday in a telephone interview 
the mechanism by which they do this is still unknown said 
barnes but the secret could have an important use in the 
transplantation of human organs the researcher said 
barnes studied the hibernation of the ground squirrels by 
surgically implanting radiotransmitting thermometers into their 
abdominal cavities signals from the thermometers provided readings 
of body temperature throughout the eight months the animals lived in 
hibernation burrows two to three feet underground in a research area 
in northern alaska 
between february and march while temperatures dropped to minus 
60 outside and to about minus one inside the underground burrows 
barnes reports in science magazine that the body temperatures of the 
ground squirrels ranged from 267 to 30 degrees 
the squirrels roused at intervals during the deep winter months 
and their temperatures went up briefly to the mid80s but the 
animals quickly settled back into hibernation torpor and body 
readings again dropped to below freezing 
in the spring barnes said the implanted thermometers were 
removed and retested to make sure the surprisingly low readings were 
correct he assured that the procedure was done surgically and 
those animals are all alive today and on their way toward another 
hibernation season 
some insects and some fish can survive subfreezing temperatures 
by producing substances called glycoproteins that prevent ice from 
forming in blood and tissues but barnes said an analysis of blood 
samples from hibernating arctic ground squirrels show the animals do 
not use such temperature defenses 
the researcher said the squirrels could be using a system that 
gives ice crystals no means to form within the circulating blood 
in order for ice to form easily barnes said there has to be a 
seed crystal around which water in the body could freeze the ground 
squirrel body could somehow block such crystals he said 
they could simply rid their body of potential nucleators or 
seed crystals but thats only speculation said barnes many 
insects do this to even much lower temperatures as do some fish 
that live at bottom in waters that are below freezing 
arctic ground squirrels weigh about two pounds and are more than 
a foot long most of their lives are spent hibernating through the 
long alaskan winters they emerge in june for a frenzy of feeding 
and mating and then return to their burrows in september before the 
ground freezes again 
barnes said understanding the ground squirrels unique ability to 
thrive after enduring subfreezing body temperatures could help 
medical science learn how to preserve human organs for 
transplantation donated organs now must be transplanted within 
hours after removal or they become useless 
a report on barnes study is published today in science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science

much of the nations chicken supply is not safe 
to eat some consumer groups say but the agriculture department 
strongly disagrees 
much of the consumer complaint involves speededup poultry 
inspection procedures which advocates say put too many dirty birds 
on family tables 
the community nutrition institute and the government 
accountability project also said thursday that usda has suppressed 
test results showing that harmful bacteria primarily salmonella 
contaminate the nations poultry supply to a far greater extent than 
acknowledged publicly 
rod leonard executive director of the institute said american 
consumers have at least one chance in two of being exposed to 
salmonella poisoning every time they eat chicken 
food poisoning caused by salmonella can cause stomach ache and 
diarrhea and can be severe in children older people and those with 
impaired immune systems 
leonard said he had two basic recommendations for consumers 
dont eat chicken but if you do handle with care 
more than 51 billion broilers or young chickens were produced 
last year most of them winding up on consumer menus 
tom devine of gap which describes itself as a whistleblower 
support group said he had no position on whether to give up chicken 
but wanted to see the federal inspection system improved 
but a usda spokeswoman said federally inspected poultry and meat 
are certainly safe to eat and that the rate of salmonella 
contamination is not as high as claimed by leonard and devine 
karen stuck of the departments food safety and inspection 
service said her agencys procedures are tested and finetuned 
before allowed in general use by plants 
theyre tested against the old system and implemented only if 
we are certain that theyre not going to reduce public health 
protection she said 
the main problem according to leonard and devine stems from 
decisions made since the late 1970s to accelerate line speeds at 
poultry slaughter plants in some cases since then they said 
speeds have been increased from 30 or so birds per minute to more 
than 100 
as a consequence leonard and devine said at a news conference 
there has been a steady increase in the crosscontamination of 
slaughtered birds as they move through the various stages of 
mechanical plucking evisceration washing and inspection

police arrested a farm supply salesman and charged 
him with criminal mischief in the poisoning of the legendary treaty 
oak during what was described as a ritual 
paul stedman cullen 45 of elroy was being held in lieu of 
20000 bail in connection with pouring the powerful herbicide 
velpar around treaty oak authorities announced in a thursday news 
conference at the centuriesold tree 
legend has it that stephen f austin the father of texas signed 
the first boundary agreement between the indians and settlers under 
the oaks branches 
the arrest is a tribute to both the good work of the austin 
police department and to the caring of this community said 
district attorney ronald earle noting that several residents phoned 
in tips 
the treaty oak is struggling to survive the poisoning which has 
received national attention on network television and in newspapers 
cullen was arrested thursday morning near a farm and ranch supply 
store where he worked said police sgt john jones who investigated 
the case the warrant said cullen acquired velpar through the 
business 
an arrest warrant authorized by state district judge jon wisser 
said cullen poisoned the treaty oak in a ritual 
wisser said that before the judge signed the warrant 
investigators told him cullen had checked out books from the public 
library on black magic and the occult 
earlier the austinamerican statesman reported an unidentified 
suspect in the poisoning had been trying to cast a spell to protect 
a woman or because of a rivalry over a woman 
cullen was charged with seconddegree felony criminal mischief 
and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a 10000 fine if 
convicted a prior felony conviction would allow that to be raised 
to a firstdegree felony with a maximum punishment of life in 
prison and a 20000 fine earle said 
the texas board of pardons and paroles said cullen was released 
from prison on march 19 1987 after serving three months of a 
twoyear sentence for burglary in travis county 
cullen was under parole supervision until december 30 1988 said 
karin armstrong spokeswoman for the board of pardons and paroles 
wisser said jones told him he had listened to a tape on which 
cullen said he poisoned the tree jones said last week that several 
callers identified the same suspect and that the man supposedly had 
told others about the episode 
officers searched for further evidence in a makeshift trailer 
where cullen lives on the grounds of the farm and ranch supply 
business in suburban austin 
after the attack was discovered early this month 11000 was 
offered for information leading to the conviction of the poisoner 
du pont which makes velpar at a plant in la porte put up 10000 
of the reward and the texas forestry association added 1000 
dallas billionaire h ross perot has pledged money and given 
advice in the effort to save the tree and state and national 
experts have recommended several forms of treatment visitors have 
left flowers and getwell messages at the oak

a young doctor who jokingly taped a 
bandage marked do not resuscitate on the head of an injured 
drifter has been ordered to perform 100 hours of community service 
at a clinic for the homeless 
administrators at humana hospital of louisville said thursday 
that the doctor will be required to donate the hours at st johns 
health center to complete a threeyear residency in emergency 
medicine at the hospital 
the doctor has not been identified because of student privacy 
laws officials said 
the message taped to the head of lewis woodard 52 is meant for 
use only with terminally ill patients woodard had been treated june 
15 for injuries suffered in a beating 
after his wounds were stitched and dressed woodard was released 
from the hospital wearing the bandage 
i was irate said sister mary kathleen sheehan the director 
of st johns where woodard stays suppose he had an asthma 
attack and that thing was on his head he just lies there and dies 
a lot of people are upset about it to say the least 
david glaspie administrator of the homeless clinic said the 
free help would be welcome the clinic currently has one doctor who 
puts in four hours three days a week and a podiatrist who treats 
foot problems for two hours one day a week 
but the longterm payoff may be even bigger glaspie has talked 
with dr donald m thomas chairman of the university of louisville 
school of medicines department of emergency medicine about 
strengthening the ties between the hospital and the homeless clinic 
one possibility thomas said would be to make a stint of service 
at the clinic a regular part of the program for residents in 
emergency medicine 
its a very unfortunate incident but i really think itll bring 
the two groups closer together thomas said 
dr salvator vicario residency director for emergency medicine 
said the doctor told him that the message was meant as joke to be 
seen only by other workers in the emergency room the doctor said he 
expected that someone would remove the piece of tape before woodard 
left the hospital vicario said 
vicario said emergencyroom residents are often disturbed by the 
apparent futility of giving care to homeless alcoholics who are 
sometimes uncooperative and frequent patients 
i think he was just frustrated vicario said 
he said the doctor had put about 60 stitches into woodards head 
wounds and had done the job well

the government is trying to collect almost 
73000 from a bank and the estate of a onetime housing broker in 
buffalo ny who auditors say withheld payments and overbilled the 
department of housing and urban development 
maureen brady the widow of former broker bernard a brady 
apparently forged his name to withdraw 20100 from a hud escrow 
account after he died in 1987 according to the federal audit 
the audit said brady mixed hud funds with his own money in the 
account withheld hud payments overbilled the department and paid 
himself advances 
hud is having trouble collecting the 72970 owed by the bradys 
said joseph b lynch manager of huds buffalo field office both 
mrs brady and the bank involved have agreed to repay the money 
although it is unclear when he said 
the bank account was frozen but hud has been unable to get at the 
money believed to be 48139 lynch said the brady estate is 
liable for the balance 
hud plans no criminal prosecution because of the amount 
involved according to a paul kane the agencys regional 
inspector general for audit 
lynch said mrs brady apparently forged her husbands signatures 
on the checks but that all the missing money was accounted for 
brady had been a closing agent on the sale of singlefamily hud 
homes and manager of at least one hud rental property according to 
the audit which covered jan 1 1985 to dec 31 1987 he died of 
cancer may 10 1987 after a long illness lynch said 
kane blamed the field office for not keeping closer tabs on what 
brady was doing and said it was the lawyer for the brady estate 
harold fein who brought problems with the bank account to the local 
offices attention 
for the 18 months from april 1985 to september 1986 brady 
submitted no monthly accounting reports to the department as 
required under his contract 
at the same time however brady was not paid about 26000 in 
monthly management fees from the department the audit found he 
also wired the same 12500 in net sales proceeds twice to the us 
treasury and overpaid hud several hundred dollars in other cases 
the audit dated jan 19 was obtained under the freedom of 
information act

states have permitted the expansion of seven 
hazardous waste landfills that are on the superfund cleanup list 
according to a congressional report 
rep bill goodling rpa said the study by the general 
accounting office illustrated the mounting trash problem the nation 
faces it may only show the tip of the iceberg with regard to 
landfill expansions he said 
goodling and sen john heinz rpa requested the nationwide 
survey by the gao the investigative arm of congress 
the report released thursday found that 14 landfills on the 
environmental protection agencys superfund list had applied to 
states to expand between october 1986 and october 1988 and that 
seven had been approved one permit was denied and six were pending 
as of late last year the gao said 
three of the seven landfills allowed to expand are in 
pennsylvania the others are in colorado indiana oklahoma and 
wisconsin gao said 
it did not identify the landfills 
there are no rules against superfund sites expanding in all but 
the oklahoma case state approval was contingent on a site cleanup 
plan the report said oklahoma mandates either that the original 
site be closed before expansion or that the landfill owner post a 
bond to guarantee adequate cleanup according to the report 
the superfund program was created in 1980 to protect water and 
air from the dangers posed by hazardous waste sites under the 
program states track down individuals or companies responsible for 
the problem and make them pay for the cleanup

a housepassed 228 billion foreign aid bill 
including new economic sanctions against china for its crackdown on 
the democracy movement is on its way to the senate where it faces 
an uncertain future 
the house approved the measure on an overwhelming 314101 vote 
thursday venting its anger over the situation in china by adding 
the sanctions over mild protests from the bush administration 
the final vote was unusually strong for a foreign aid bill which 
traditionally engenders little enthusiasm in congress 
this is one of the best foreign aid bills weve passed said 
an ebullient rep william broomfield of michigan the senior 
republican on the foreign affairs committee ive never seen 
anything like it theres momentum and confidence and respect by 
both parties 
the measure provides about 115 billion each in fiscal 1990 and 
1991 for military economic and development aid to dozens of 
friendly nations around the globe 
as it moved toward final passage the house adopted an amendment 
softening restrictions on the administration that were intended to 
head off efforts to generate thirdcountry support for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels the bush administration had warned the 
restrictions could be grounds for a presidential veto of the entire 
bill 
with that change the administration seemed inclined to 
grudgingly declare victory and work for further changes when the 
bill goes to the senate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about the unanimous 
house vote for new china sanctions said thursday evening we will 
review the bill we believe its unnecessary but well take a 
look at it when we see it 
we made a lot of progress said one state department source 
speaking only on condition of anonymity the china sanctions the 
house adopted were milder than the administration had feared from a 
congress that has voiced impatience with bushs cautious response to 
beijings bloody crackdown 
the measure still is far from certain to become law the senate 
foreign relations committee has shown little interest in working on 
its version of the bill this year often failing to even get a 
quorum 
on the matter of china the house endorsed bushs previous moves 
to condemn government violence halt military aid and ban exchanges 
of military officials and highlevel visits 
but the package passed on a 4180 vote went a step further 
adding suspension of trade and development programs a ban on the 
sale of police equipment and a limit on transfer of hightechnology 
and nuclear materials or components 
the chinese leadership should be aware there is a very 
deepseated revulsion in congress about the barbarian tactics they 
have employed said broomfield who helped draft the sanctions 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo noted that the 
administration opposed the china sanctions as robbing it of 
flexibility and infringing on presidential foreign policy 
prerogatives 
but he added i think someone in this government and today 
its the house has to speak clearly on behalf of the american 
people and take more forceful action than the president and the 
secretary of state have been to date willing to take 
before the vote secretary of state james a baker iii had 
rejected the package declaring that human rights is not the only 
principle which determines our foreign policy

mortgage lenders and the government corporation 
that finances veterans loans have mounted separate challenges of a 
new policy covering how the veterans affairs department handles 
property in default 
both the 2200member mortgage bankers association and the 
government national mortgage association say a new way of assessing 
the cost to the va of taking over defaulted property will add insult 
to an already injured program 
it could also curtail the program that provides mortgages with 
special terms to veterans they say 
under assault is the proposal by the department to add borrowing 
costs to the formula for determining whether to acquire a foreclosed 
home and sell it or let the private lender take it over such costs 
as cleanup repair and commissions already are included in 
determining the net fair value of property 
the borrowing costs would take into account money used to acquire 
the home until it could be resold 
the department announced march 31 that the new policy would take 
effect aug 1 the lenders filed suit wednesday in us district 
court for the district of columbia asking to block the order so 
far no action has been taken 
louis c gasper the executive vice president of the government 
national mortgage association or ginnie mae voiced his concerns to 
veterans secretary edward j derwinski in a letter may 5 that was 
made public this week 
our losses on va loans have rapidly mounted during the past 18 
months until we consider them to be the number one threat to the 
viability of the concept of a governmentguaranteed mortgagebacked 
security program gasper wrote 
ginnie mae sells securities that are backed by the mortgages 
gasper said six lenders have defaulted recently on their 
obligations to the ginnie mae mostly as a result of the growing 
tendency of the veterans department to nobid on foreclosures 
when the department does not bid on the foreclosure of a 
governmentguaranteed home the lender must acquire and dispose of 
the property adding to its losses the mba said in a statement 
accompanying the lawsuit the department then pays only the portion 
of the loan that it originally guaranteed which is 40 percent or 50 
percent up to 36000 
the lenders group whose members hold 80 percent of veterans 
department loans says the loss to its members for each piece of 
property not acquired by the agency will be 18000 both sides say 
the department will take over in 10 percent fewer foreclosures as a 
result of the higher net fair value that results from the new 
formula 
thomas w maher assistant director for property management at 
agency said the problem of defaults and foreclosures appears to be 
abating in the peak month of december 1987 there were 16200 
defaults there were 13600 at the end of may this year 
there were 22200 foreclosures as of december 1987 compared with 
20100 in may he said

there were plastic cups and bottles by the tens 
of thousands and almost as many metal cans 
bottle caps alone totaled 42671 nothing compared to the 78025 
plastic trash bags or the 65819 pieces of jagged glass 
and one cant forget the bedsprings mattresses even a kitchen 
sink or two or the 11 bottles containing notes from faroff 
places and finally the 1718 plastic syringes and other medical 
wastes not to mention the set of dentures 
from the washington state coast to the louisiana delta and on to 
maine thousands of volunteers combed 3500 miles of beaches last 
fall about a fourth of the countrys ocean shoreline and those 
were only some of the items they found 
the center for marine conservation a private conservation group 
tabulated the findings and detailed them in a report thursday 
entitled trash on americas beaches a national assessment 
we were definitely amazed at the numbers said kathryn 
ohara director of the project 
what became clear in the cleanup campaign actually no more than 
three hours on any beach area last september and early october was 
that americas beaches are littered with trash said the report 
the 47000 volunteers found and recorded 1973995 pieces of 
debris from discarded fishing lines to unwanted underwear the items 
weighed more than 1000 tons or nearly 600 pounds of debris for 
every mile of beach more than half of the items counted were made 
of plastic 
while medical wastes have garnered much of the publics 
attention ms ohara said plastic debris is the no 1 enemy of 
americas beaches and coastal areas 
the trash can be deadly 
thousands of marine mammals sea turtles seabirds and fish die 
every year when entangled in debris items such as rope nets and 
fishing line or from ingesting items like plastic bags and 
sheeting mistaking them for food said the groups report 
despite the uproar about medical wastes only a small percentage 
of the items were reported in that category the volunteers recorded 
finding 1718 plastic syringes during their searches which accounts 
for less than onetenth of 1 percent of all the debris found 
according to the findings 
ms ohara said other medical wastes were not specifically 
counted in a category although volunteers noted finding such items 
as plastic gloves hospital caps plastic tubing 
by far the greatest amount of trash involved some sort of plastic 
product 78025 plastic trash bags 26148 milk or water jugs 
19300 plastic bleach cleaner bottles 14721 foamed trays and 
9526 egg cartons 
among the dirty dozen items glass beverage bottles ranked 
no 6 with 95028 bottles littering the beaches in addition to the 
tens of thousands of pieces of glass the volunteers also found 
light bulbs fluorescent light tubes wooden crates assorted 
fishing lines rubber gloves fishing nets and 857 plastic hard 
hats 
and 11 volunteers found bottles with messages inside including 
one on a connecticut beach that said it had been dumped into the 
water in europe 
and the volunteers at times uncovered not trash but cash 
including a 100 bill on a texas beach and a diamond and amethyst 
necklace in florida according to the report 
some states had more trash than others here are the states where 
the most pounds of debris per miles of beach were recovered georgia 
4000 texas 3549 mississippi 3000 and louisiana 2337

reformers say president bushs proposals for 
revising congressional campaign finances are inadequate and 
democrats say they amount to hardball party politics 
he has chosen to submit proposals that blatantly favor the 
republican party and jeopardize bipartisan efforts already 
underway to draft a campaign reform bill said house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash 
bush announced thursday proposals he said would help curb the 
influence of special interests and reduce the advantage 
congressional incumbents have over challengers 
we must do more to truly clean up the system he said 
bush said he supported cutting back on the freepostage privilege 
for lawmakers which he said pays for mass mailings that amount to 
political advertising he called for new laws to do away with 
gerrymandering the drawing of oddlyshaped congressional districts 
to help certain candidates 
political action committees connected with businesses labor or 
trade groups should be banned he said and contribution ceilings to 
other pacs cut from 5000 to 2500 
but the president declined to endorse public financing of 
congressional campaigns a favorite idea of many reformers or 
overall campaign spending limits that have been urged by democratic 
officials as well as private groups 
fred wertheimer president of common cause a goodgovernment 
group that has lobbied for changes in campaign law said bushs plan 
will not solve the basic campaign finance problems facing congress 
today 
to accomplish that it would have to also include overall 
spending limits public financing and shutting down socalled 
soft money prohibited corporate and union financing that 
enters campaigns through loopholes in current law bush said he 
would favor disclosure of soft money 
bob dreyfuss spokesman for the advocacy group public citizen 
said that in dismissing public financing and spending limits bush 
tends to really allow the people with money to have undue 
influence in politics 
bush said public financing would exclude individuals from the 
political process by denying them the opportunity to contribute and 
spending limits would discourage them from contributing 
bushs proposals to reduce the advantages of incumbency would 
naturally hurt more democrats than republicans because there are 
more democrats in congress 
but democrats said bushs plan was also carefully crafted to 
coddle the types of donations republicans are more likely to get and 
shut down democratic funding sources 
a totally partisan package has been set forward said rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee he called it a pr effort on the part of the 
president that appears to have been written by republican 
national chairman lee atwater and gop house campaign chief ed 
rollins 
although bush proposed to restrict political action committees 
he would allow continuation of ideological pacs many of which 
are oneissue groups which favor republican causes 
he would also ban lawmakers from carrying campaign funds from one 
election to the next a practice which helps senior democratic 
incumbents scare off challengers 
meanwhile bush would more than double the amount of money that 
political parties where big contributors have given the gop a 
fundraising advantage can give to their congressional candidates 
rep al swift dwash said that proposal would funnel more 
money from the wealthy to the candidates while avoiding disclosure 
of the source of the money 
this really just sets up another hideandgoseek game but 
does nothing to solve the problem of soaring spending on political 
campaigns said swift cochairman of a bipartisan house task force 
on campaign reform due to present a report later this year

a move to halt new offshore oil exploration is 
gaining momentum in congress where the exxon valdez disaster hangs 
like an oil slick over the debate on opening new coastal areas to 
the petroleum industry 
the house appropriations committee approved legislation thursday 
calling for a moratorium on new oil and gas exploratory leases along 
vast stretches of coastal waters from the georges bank off new 
england to alaskas bristol bay 
the measure is likely to clear the house and the white house has 
begun to focus on the senate in hopes of blocking final approval of 
the ban which president bush maintains will threaten the countrys 
domestic energy needs 
the moratorium included in an 116 billion fiscal 1990 money 
bill for the interior department prompted heated debate before 
clearing the committee by voice vote after two damaging amendments 
were defeated by votes of 2822 and 2922 
but the debate made clear the deep concern felt by many members 
of congress over the possibility of an oil spill a concern spawned 
by the march 24 exxon spill in alaska and intensified by three 
recent smaller spills in rhode island delaware and texas 
weve got to wait argued rep silvio conte rmass urging 
approval of the yearlong moratorium on further offshore oil 
exploration until better safeguards are shown to protect against an 
oil spill 
weve seen whats happened in prince william sound in alaska 
declared rep sidney yates dill adding that the same potential 
damage is present in other coastal areas 
opponents of the moratorium which would prohibit the interior 
department from issuing offshore oil leases until october 1990 in 
the areas affected argued that such delays would seriously harm the 
countrys energy policy 
what were doing in the name of the environment is cutting off 
our domestic energy sources were going to have brownouts and 
then there will be blackouts argued rep bob livingston rla 
rep ralph regula rohio argued that the bristol bay leases 
pose no environmental threat to the bay area one of the countrys 
premier commercial fishing areas although the oil would be 
transported by tanker 
the interior department last year sold six leases in bristol bay 
for exploratory drilling for 95 million but will have to buy them 
back if the moratorium clears congress 
an exploratory drilling moratorium already has been in effect on 
leases in many of the areas included in the legislation but the oil 
industry had hoped before the alaska spill that some of those bans 
would be lifted this year instead the moratorium would be extended 
another year and expanded 
the legislation would extend or impose a ban on exploratory 
drilling until october 1990 off california off southwestern 
floridas everglades in the georges bank off new england and along 
a 50mile wide coastal strip from rhode island to maryland 
this is a critical victory at a critical time said rep leon 
panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget committee the 
message is clear we will not tolerate more tragic oil spills 
this is no less than a major victory for the environment 
said lisa speer of the natural resources defense counsel a private 
environmental group after the committee vote 
president bush earlier this year ordered the postponement of 
lease sales off southern and northern california as well as off 
southwestern florida pending an environmental review but those 
leases could be put out for bid early next year if congress does not 
intervene

mayor tom bradley begins an unprecedented 
fifth term today with an inaugural party supporters hope will 
overshadow investigations of his ethics 
ten other newly elected city officials also were to be sworn in 
on citys hall south lawn 
we are expecting a positive celebration said mayors 
spokesman bill chandler 
among those expected to take part in the ceremony were city 
attorney james hahn who is conducting a criminal investigation to 
determine if bradley violated conflictofinterest laws by accepting 
at least 89000 in fees from two financial institutions that did 
business with the city 
others expected were newly elected city council members michael 
woo gloria molina and joan milke flores who form the committee 
monitoring hahns investigation 
bradley was not expected to mention the investigations during his 
inaugural speech chandler said the mayor will answer all the 
questions once the inquiries are completed he said 
bradley 71 took office in 1973 when he unseated sam yorty 
in aprils nonpartisan mayoral primary bradley defeated city 
councilman nate holden with 52 percent of the vote just enough to 
avoid a general election bradley has been expected to trounce 
holden but was hurt by disclosures about his ties with banks that 
do business with the city 
newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to launch a 
conflictofinterest investigation on march 31 the state fair 
political practices commission later began its own probe 
soon questions arose about whether bradley had exchanged 
political favors for preferential treatment at drexel burnham 
lambert an investment banking firm 
the us justice department and the securities and exchange 
commission later opened additional investigations 
bradley told the city council on may 10 that he had made an 
error in judgment by engaging in outside employment but insisted 
he had done nothing illegal and would be vindicated

warning flag with a black international symbol for radioactivity 
into a hole of the missile launcher

fellow activists in a dingy beside the sub left then a soviet 
crewman immediately took down the flag which has three triangles 
meeting in the middle 
the nuclearpowered submarine carries four tubes for cruise 
nucleartipped missiles 
greenpeace spokesman magnus furugard said the soviet crew warily 
watched the dinghies with binoculars 
after the activists stopped next to the submarine they waited 
to see how they reacted aboard the spokesman said as it is 
war ships we are dealing with we are very careful 
the crew appeared mainly curious said furugard 
the crew did not intervene until after our activist was on his 
way down from the sub and a sailor ran out to pull the banner 
away furugard said 
at least 15 nato vessels were taking part in the naval exercise 
including the us battleship iowa and cruiser ticonderoga both 
carrying nuclear weapons according to greenpeace

weapons in its waters but it does not question visitors who decline 
to say if such arms are on board

the growth in americans standard of living 
lagged behind other major industrialized nations last year despite a 
surge in us export sales according to a report 
the report released thursday which was prepared by the council 
on competitiveness said the united states had failed to keep pace 
with its major trading partners over the past 16 years losing 
additional ground in 1988 
the findings came from the councils second annual 
competitiveness index an effort to measure us standing in the 
world economy in terms that have meaning to the average american 
the council tracks competitiveness in four areas living 
standards worker productivity the us share of the world export 
market and american investment in education and nondefense research 
and development 
those categories were chosen because of their relationship to 
americas changing fortunes in the world economy 
us investment must keep pace with expenditures of other nations 
to boost american productivity a measure of output per hour of work 
rising productivity is needed to make american products 
competitive on world markets thus lowering americas huge trade 
deficit and providing the income growth to boost american living 
standards 
while the council found that the growth in americas living 
standard was lagging behind other countries the united states still 
had the second highest living standard west germany is first

jim wright whose resignation from the 
us house takes effect today thanked about 3000 enthusiastic 
supporters who greeted him at a homecoming bash and said he is 
undecided about what hell do next 
i want to thank you for being broadminded enough tolerant 
enough bigspirited enough to tolerate my foibles my 
eccentricities and my mistakes occasionally wright said as the 
crowd cheered thursday night and you let me do the big and 
important things that helped all of us 
in his folksy speech during which he stood relaxed with his 
hands in his pockets wright said he would like to remain active as 
a private citizen he said he would like to work toward peace in 
latin america and he added that talking with college students made 
him happy 
after the 15minute speech at the hotel convention center he 
said he had yet to make any longrange plans 
the former speaker never specifically mentioned the 69 alleged 
violations of house ethics rules that prompted him to announce may 
31 that he was resigning the house seat he held more than 34 years 
but he blamed his troubles partly on reporters who he said were 
too quick to write about rumors 
when julius caesar rode his chariot through adoring crowds 
wright said a man continuously whispered in his ear remember 
julius youre only a man 
he continued thank goodness i dont need somebody to remind me 
of that now in our modern society we have the newspapers to 
remind us of that 
afterward wright took off his coat and sat on the edge of the 
stage shaking hands signing autographs and saying hello to old 
friends 
smiling and pleased with his reception he said he felt no 
bitterness toward the media and his political opponents anyone 
who carries a burden of bitterness does more harm to himself than 
anyone else he said 
the rev carol ann tatum of fort worth braved the crush in front 
of the stage and emerged with autographs of wright and his wife 
betty who sat beside him 
i feel fantastic that other people feel the same way about him 
that i do and thats pure love she said 
jack adkison a city councilman in the fort worth suburb of river

roman catholic churches are helping a 
minister and rabbi gather signatures for a petition drive to force a 
referendum on the citys domestic partners ordinance 
though the petition is not officially sanctioned by archbishop 
john quinn some local catholic churches have encouraged 
parishioners to sign it after sunday masses church officials said 
in their petition the rev charles mcilhenny of the first 
orthodox presbyterian church and rabbi lionel feldman say the 
domestic partners ordinance arbitrarily redefined the timehonored 
and hallowed nature of the family flying therewith in the face of 
some of societys most precious values it is only fair that the 
issue should be submitted to all the voters 
the law enacted june 5 is intended to extend health benefits 
to domestic partners of city workers under the law livein 
lovers would be entitled to bereavement leave and hospital 
visitation rights 
the law defines domestic partners as any two people who have 
chosen to share one anothers lives in an intimate and committed 
relationship it is not binding on private businesses 
the clergymens petition is one of several on file at city hall 
to get on the ballot organizers must submit the signatures of 
18800 registered voters registrar germaine wong said thursday 
mcilhenny whose ministry is not affiliated with the mainline 
presbyterian church refused to comment thursday feldman has been 
unavailable for comment 
rita semel executive director of the jewish community relations 
council said feldman does not run a synagogue the local board of 
rabbis has not taken a position on the ordinance semel said 
quinn has condemned the legislation as a profound attack on 
marriage and the family 
still deacon norman phillips a spokesman for the archdiocese 
said quinn hasnt put anything in writing as far as i know but i 
think its logical to assume were going to be in sympathy with it 
because we were opposed to the legislation in the first place

the navy has apologized to a sailor for 
falsely implicating him in the uss iowa turret explosion that killed 
47 seamen the mans lawyer said 
two naval investigative service agents apologized to gunners 
mate 3rd class kendall truitt wednesday for news leaks suggesting 
truitt was involved in the april 19 explosion said miami attorney 
ellis rubin 
we now demand that the navy officially clear mr truitt and 
tell the public that he is not a homosexual nor was he involved in 
any murdersuicide pact that resulted in the explosion rubin said 
in a news release thursday 
meanwhile abc news reported that the nis admitted much of the 
information it leaked to reporters was false including a suggestion 
that a homosexual relationship existed between truitt and gunners 
mate clayton hartwig hartwig named truitt sole beneficiary of his 
50000 doubleindemnity life insurance policy 
navy spokesmen in norfolk va and mayport naval station said 
they could not comment on the abc report they also said they had no 
knowledge of the apology and the other information released by rubin 
the navy investigation is still ongoing said lt larry 
thomas a spokesman in norfolk 
hartwig was killed at his position in the gun turret truitt who 
was in the turrets powder magazines five decks below survived the 
blast rubin said the navy is looking at the possibility of a 
suicide by hartwig 
theres no hard evidence that there was a suicide and we will 
address that matter when we go to collect the insurance proceeds 
rubin said in a telephone interview from his miami office 
rubin said the money was being withheld pending an outcome of the 
navys investigation 
abc said the nis also admitted its reports of finding a blasting 
cap or timing device among hartwigs belongings were false and that 
it wrongly characterized a booklet of practical jokes titled how 
to get even without going to jail as a volume detailing methods 
of constructing booby traps and other deadly devices 
abc also said it obtained copies of 17 letters from hartwig which 
appear to contradict the navys claim that hartwig was despondent 
and suicidal 
lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman in washington dc 
said the navys report on the accident has not yet been issued 
the investigation continues and we are not in position to confirm 
any information that abc put in its piece tonight he said 
the apology by special agents came during a 3hour interview 
with truitt rubin said they apologized for the initial press 
release from the navy and from nis which grew into a national smear 
of mr truitt the attorney said 
rubin said agents were interviewing truitts parents and friends 
in land o lakes and seeking to question truitts wife carole 
again i have ordered no more interviews of my client its 
getting to be harassment rubin said 
the attorney said he and truitt had been invited to testify in 
july before the senate judiciary committee a subcommittee is 
probing how information about the investigation was leaked to the 
media 
shortly after the uss iowa explosion published reports said the 
navy was investigating the relationship between truitt and hartwig 
truitt has vehemently denied wrongdoing and said the navy was 
attempting to make him a scapegoat for the disaster 
earlier this month truitt was reassigned from the uss iowa and 
reported for duty at mayport naval station north of jacksonville

a new pennyapack cigarette tax to generate money 
for the homeless is winning praise from advocates and criticism from 
the tobacco industry which says smokers shouldnt pay an undue 
portion of social programs 
the measure which raises the city tax on cigarettes one cent to 
16 cents a pack is expected to provide 18 million annually to 
cityfunded homeless shelters 
it takes effect at the end of july and won unanimous approval 
wednesday in the city council 
because it is summertime a lot of people forget about the 
homeless because they say its warm outside said alderman luis v 
gutierrez who cosponsored the measure but this is the perfect 
time to do this so we have time to prepare for the winter 
an estimated 35 of the citys 53 shelters will benefit said 
francis tobin housing organizer for the chicago coalition for the 
homeless a nonprofit advocacy group that lobbied heavily for the 
measure 
it will mean beds and food but more importantly it will mean 
support services in the shelters like transportation to the welfare 
office to job interviews and housing relocation assistance for 
homeless people tobin said in a telephone interview thursday 
the citys homeless are estimated to number between 35000 and 
40000 that number has increased from about 25000 just a few years 
ago due to a lack of affordable housing tobin said 
the new tax will change the way that we look at the homeless 
and represents higher priority solutions rather than just a 
bandaid approach he said 
a pack of cigarettes in chicago now has a 61cent tax 15 cents 
to the city 10 cents to the county 20 cents to the state and 16 
cents to the federal government 
that levy is one of the highest in the nation and already forces 
smokers in the city to pay more than their fair share said gary 
miller a spokesman for the tobacco institute a washington 
dcbased group that represents us tobacco companies 
when it comes to public programs such as chicagos new 
measure the financial burden should be evenly spread across our 
society not just imposed on smokers miller said he said he knew 
of no other similar tax 
kerrie wilson a spokeswoman for the american cancer society 
said she was unaware of a measure like chicagos she said the 
cancer society generally believes that increasing the cost of 
cigarettes is a good way to help curb tobacco use which has been 
linked to causing some cancers

riconada to run for his fathers vacated congressional seat

sex scandal may resign over his failure to rally support for his 
party news reports said today 
a new poll published in the mainichi shimbun said unos liberal 
democratic party was likely to lose heavily in sundays tokyo 
metropolitan assembly election 
it is the first major vote since uno became prime minister less 
than a month ago and a barometer of how the governing party will 
fare in voting july 23 for half the seats in the upper house of 
parliament 
party leaders had hoped that uno would reverse their sagging 
fortunes after he replaced noboru takeshita who resigned june 2 
over an influencepeddling scandal

governing party low in popularity the party has been battered by 
the scandal that drove out takeshita an unpopular new sales tax 
and now charges that uno has been involved in extramarital affairs 
on wednesday uno denied news reports that he had threatened to 
resign over the sex allegations but todays press reports indicated 
he faces a short tenure as premier and that japan could have an 
early national election 
however foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said uno will 
represent japan at a summit of seven leading industrial democracies 
in paris starting july 14 
we keep having every day study sessions with mr uno and we 
are confident that our government will be well represented at the 
summit watanabe said 
however four national newspapers quoted chief cabinet secretary 
masajuro shiokawa as saying in a meeting thursday with union leaders 
that unos resignation and dissolution of the powerful lower house 
of parliament might come before long 
the prime ministers office refused to comment on the reports 
saying the meeting was an offtherecord session 
dissolving the lower house would lead to national elections many 
commentators say the liberal democrats who have controlled the 
government for 34 years could lose 
the mainichi shimbun said unos resignation could come between 
sundays election and the parliamentary election scheduled for july 
23 it said uno could also be forced to resign if his party loses 
its majority of the 252 upper house seats in july 
senior liberal democratic officials are considering a temporary 
prime minister because a loss in the upper house election will be 
obvious due to unos womanizing scandal the paper said 
in its poll about 21 percent of the 1600 eligible voters 
questioned said they would vote liberal democratic candidates in the 
tokyo elections while 17 percent said they would vote for the japan 
socialist party the countrys largest opposition party 
however 40 percent of voters polled june 2325 said they were 
undecided and the rest of the voters supported smaller parties 
the newspaper did not give a margin of error 
in the last tokyo election four years ago the liberal demcrats 
captured 36 percent of the vote winning 63 of 127 seats in the 
assembly while 12 percent voted for the socialist party the rest 
of the votes went to three smaller opposition parties 
the newspaper said a large number of women were breaking from the 
liberal democrats women who said they would shift to the socialists 
jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent while those who said they would 
vote for liberal democrats shrank from 33 to 18 percent 
media reports have circulated since unos first week in office 
that the married prime minister had affairs with geisha highly 
trained female entertainers and other women he reportedly gave 
them money 
after the latest reports uno said he was innocent and that he 
had never acted contrary to morality 
liberal democratic candidates in tokyo have not been inviting uno 
to stump for them

a natural protein produced in healthy 
breast cells could be useful in determining likely breast cancer 
victims and in treating the disease a researcher says 
the protein mammastatin already has been shown to stop the 
growth of most types of breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory 
dr max s wicha a professor of internal medicine and director of 
the university of michigan cancer center said thursday 
we speculate that women with low levels of mammastatin may be 
more prone to develop breast cancer wicha said if this is the 
case a scientist could potentially detect and correct a womens 
predisposition to breast cancer before the disease occurs 
wicha said he and fellow researchers discovered mammastatin three 
years ago while searching for compounds that could block growth of 
cancerous cells they have succeeded in isolating and purifying 
mammastatin but not in quantities large enough to inject into 
laboratory animals he said 
the researchers hope to use recombinant dna technology to clone 
the gene that produces mammastatin wicha said 
they already have developed a blood test for mammastatin levels 
but must spend the next several years testing women with and without 
breast cancer to determine if there is a link between the protein 
and the disease he said 
mammastatin might inhibit breast cancer by shutting down breast 
cell growth near the end of pregnancy wicha said researchers 
believe production of the protein might account for a 50 percent 
reduction in the risk of breast cancer among pregnant teenagers 
whose breast tissue is still developing he said 
if the protective effects of pregnancy are due to mammastatin 
then one could potentially administer this agent to lower the risk 
of developing breast cancer in women who have not been pregnant 
he said 
mammastatin might be used in conjunction with chemotherapy to 
kill cancerous cells more effectively than chemotherapy alone wicha 
said 
wicha research associate paul ervin and drs mark kaminski and 
robert cody reported their findings in this weeks issue of science 
the university said

hundreds of israelis with 
military escorts hiked and rode in cars through the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip today to dramatize their claim to the 
territories 
soldiers blocked one group from marching through an arab village 
because the hikers were not accompanied by soldiers intended to 
prevent clashes 
israel radio said about 2000 people took part in the day of 
hikes most of which were in the west bank critics said the marches 
were a provocation to palestinians residents and a burden on the 
army 
maj gen amram mitzna head of the armys central command 
landed in a helicopter and ordered armed hikers of the antiarab 
kach party from entering the village of battir near the west bank 
town of bethlehem 
this is a minority creating trouble mitzna told reporters 
about a mile from the village if we have to arrest them well 
arrest them we wont let them go anywhere 
mitzna said soldiers stopped the 20 members of the group headed 
by americanborn rabbi meir kahane because they defied army orders 
to hike only with military escorts 
the kach party hikers armed with automatic rifles pistols 
knives and clubs turned back when ordered to do so they went back 
toward jerusalem carrying israeli flags and party banners which 
show a fist set in the jewish star of david 
the jewish settler movement gush emunim or bloc of the faithful 
said there would be about 40 hikes to back the settlers claim to 
all the biblical land of israel however several of the supposed 
marches turned out to be trips in cars 
arab witnesses in bani naim near the west bank city of hebron 
said about 15 car filled with jewish settlers drove through bani 
naim along with seven carloads of soldiers some firing in the air 
to frighten away potential stone throwers 
another convoy of cars drove past palestinian flags waving from 
utility poles or wire on the way to an ancient jewish cemetery in 
samua about eight miles south of hebron 
noam arnon spokesman for gush emunim pointed to damage on the 
synagogue calling it an example of arab terrorism 
a palestinian teacher who gave his name only as mohammed was 
waiting to enter a mosque nearby he said villagers resented the 
intrusion by jewish settlers on friday the moslem holy day today 
is our day for praying he said 
about 70000 jewish settlers live in the occupied lands along 
with about 17 million palestinians 
the bible grew up in this land all these places are linked to 
the bible but we chose the places according to the landscape and 
nature said yehuda hazani a gush emunim organizer 
brig gen ephraim sneh a legislator from the centerleft labor 
party and former army commander said on israel radio that the hikes 
would increase tensions between arabs and jews 
in the context of the intefadeh uprising these are not 
hikes these are political protests he said when they increase 
friction with the arabs instead of reducing it they have the most 
negative value 
he said the hikes hinder army efforts to combat the uprising 
against israeli rule in the territories which were seized from 
neighboring arab states in the 1967 middle east war 
in the past month hikes by armed settlers have resulted in 
clashes with palestinians in which a 20yearold arab shepherd and a 
15yearold palestinian girl were killed settlers are being 
investigated as suspects in both slayings 
the settlers have complained that the army has not done enough to 
protect them against palestinians throwing stones or firebombs 
during the uprising at least 538 palestinians and 23 israelis have 
been killed since the uprising began in december 1987 
in the gaza strip plobacked activists declared a threeday 
general strike to protest the deportation of eight palestinians on 
thursday 
similar strikes were reported in the west bank towns of ramallah 
and el bireh just north of jerusalem 
israel said the palestinians deported were leaders of the 
uprising they were sent to neighboring lebanon

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze won 
unanimous confirmation in his job today from the new soviet 
legislature he was the first cabinet member to win approval without 
questioning from the supreme soviet 
there was no discussion on the shevardnadze vote but 
confirmation of the nominee for the state foreign economic 
commission was postponed after he failed to win a required majority 
of the 542seat legislature possibly because of high absenteeism 
all the lawmakers were present to raise their hands in support of 
shevardnadze 
shevardnadze went to the podium and waited for questions about 
his stewardship of the countrys foreign policy but nobody said a 
word 
the candidates authority among parliamentarians is so high 
that the decision was made without any consideration of the 
candidates program the official tass news agency said 
shevardnadze and other ministers were reportedly questioned in 
closed committee hearings last week as the legislature for the first 
time exercised veto power over top government officials and forced 
the withdrawal of seven nominees 
the popular foreign minister has helped produce a nuclear arms 
limitation treaty the withdrawal of red army troops from 
afghanistan and vastly improved relations with neighbors like china 
and iran 
confirmation of vladimir kamentsev as a deputy premier and head 
of the state foreign economic commission was postponed after he 
failed to win a majority tass said the vote was 246 for 97 
against with 56 abstentions 
only 438 legislators signed in for the session and many were 
outside the hall when the vote on kamentsev was taken 
by law a cabinet nominee is to earn at least 272 votes to be 
endorsed tass said it said another vote would be taken at a 
later date 
kamentsev was accused of being incompetent because he has been in 
charge of the soviet unions foreign economic activities for two 
years during which foreign trade has decreased 
deputies complained he had no clear strategy for increasing the 
countrys commercial dealings with the rest of the world and for 
dealing with what some have called virtual isolation from the world 
economy 
the legislature was also considering the nomination of vitaly 
doguzhiev to head a newly created commission on emergencies to 
coordinate reaction to disasters like the armenian earthquake and 
the recent explosion of leaking gas in central asia that engulfed 
two trains and killed 600 people tass said 
doguzhiev had been minister of general machinebuilding 
before recessing until monday the supreme soviet also approved 
the nominations of nikolai laverov to be a deputy premier in charge 
of science and technology and mikhail shkabardnya to be the 
cabinets business manager

supreme court justice louis peck can 
remain on the bench for at least 10 more days as lawyers battle 
over whether the justice should be forced to retire because of his 
age 
us district court judge lee gagliardi issued a temporary 
restraining order on thursday stopping the state from forcing peck 
off the bench today 
the state had issued the june 30 retirement order because peck 
turned 70 in december and the state constitution requires all judges 
to retire at age 70 peck is fighting the order saying federal law 
prohibiting age discrimination supersedes the state constitutional 
provision 
gagliardis order allows peck to remain on the job for 10 days 
but lawyers on both sides said the order could be extended if there 
is no decision within that period 
the understanding is that the judge will renew the restraining 
order until there is a decision in the case said james lee the 
new york regional attorney for the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission this will allow justice peck to stay in 
office while the case is argued 
the equal employment opportunity commission is handling the case 
on pecks behalf the commission believes the action to force pecks 
retirement constitutes age discrimination 
peck said he was pleased by the order and is looking forward to 
getting a decision this settles whether i have to move out this 
weekend but the case has a long way to go the justice said 
the legal question is whether a federal law concerning age 
discrimination should be applied to appointed state judges 
in 1986 congress amended the federal age discrimination in 
employment act to extend protections to people of all ages 
previously the act had covered people only up to age 70 
the federal law however does contain exceptions elected 
officers the personal staff of elected officers and policymaking 
appointees courts in massachusetts have ruled that appointed state 
judges like peck also should be excluded

legislators should amend a recent law and 
make information on crime victims available to the public but bar 
companies trying to sell security systems from using the 
information gov bill clements said 
we will not stand by and allow texans to be preyed upon by 
criminals and unscrupulous business practices the governor said 
in a news release thursday he said he was adding the law to the 
agenda for the special legislative session which began last week 
clements urged legislators to amend the law to make information 
on crime victims available to the public and media rather than 
repeal it outright penalties should be established for people or 
businesses that use crime victim information for commercial profit 
he said 
allowing the texas open records act to become the texas closed 
records act is inexcusable clements said clearly the texas 
media has a right indeed an obligation to fully and accurately 
inform the people of texas 
action on the amendment proposal is not expected until next week 
at the earliest 
the new law believed to be the first of its kind in the nation 
allows government agencies including police and fire departments to 
withhold the names addresses and other identifying information of 
felony crime victims the law has angered news organizations and 
confused police 
news organizations throughout texas have been unable to get 
routine crime information such as the names of people killed in 
drunken driving accidents 
state lawmakers had asked clements to put the issue on the

mayor james jernigan has blocked the city 
councils plan to fly an american flag upside down on july fourth 
saying it was not an appropriate protest of the us supreme court 
decision on flag burning 
the council had voted unanimously to invert the flag to protest 
the decision that flag burning is constitutionally protected as 
freedom of speech 
the councils decision had sparked protest in this western 
georgia city with lawyer seth harp threatening to go to court to 
stop it and other residents threatening to right the flag themselves 
the situation got out of hand jernigan said thursday he used a 
littleknown city code that allows the mayor to send resolutions 
back to the council 
in a sense we are backing down it is in the best interest of 
the community he said 
the us flag code says an inverted flag is a distress signal 
indicating severe threat to life or property

the national right to life committee 
opened its threeday convention without a supreme court ruling on 
abortion but leaders said the decision wont affect their efforts 
we just simply will have to wait until the babys born the 
committees general counsel james bopp jr told the conventions 
opening session thursday at the radisson south hotel 
mary schmit codirector of minnesota citizens concerned for 
life said that regardless of the supreme court decision our 
work will be more challenging than ever 
the challenge she said is not to rest until all of the 
antilife laws are erased from the books 
our role is to be a little thorn in the side being a thorn in 
the side doesnt always make the body politic very happy said 
wanda franz the national right to life committee vice president 
the conventions first day included picketing by about 150 
supporters of legalized abortion but no major confrontations 
between the opposing sides occurred 
the supreme courts ruling in the missouri case webster vs 
reproductive health services had been expected thursday but was 
delayed until at least monday 
the law in question restricts the availability of abortions and 
defines life as beginning at conception the case went to the 
supreme court after the 8th us circuit court of appeals struck 
down the law in july saying it conflicted with the high courts 
1973 roe vs wade decision which legalized abortions 
about 1500 people were registered for the convention which 
continues through saturday 
one of the registrants was bill baird of hempstead ny who 
said he has attended the annual meeting for the last 16 years to 
represent the opposition viewpoint 
i have learned after 26 years of fighting for reproductive 
freedom to never give up never surrender freedom is not free 
said baird a longtime activist for abortion rights who runs three 
abortioncounseling clinics in new york and massachusetts 
bairds presence was ignored by most of the convention delegates 
but one man confiscated the materials his assistant was handing out 
about 15 demonstrators also stood on the grass alongside the 
driveway entrance to the hotel holding up large signs to express 
their views supporting legalized abortion issue as people drove into 
the parking lot 
all were doing is basically just providing a prochoice 
presence said gloria totten education coordinator for the 
abortion rights council in minnesota we respect the abortion 
opponents right to be here and we would never do anything 
confrontational we just wanted to show a presence 
bopp emphasized that the committee condones only lawful 
activities in its fight to overturn laws allowing abortion 
we do not support unlawful activities he said if those 
unlawful acts by other demonstrators are violent we condemn 
them 
president bush greeted the conventioneers in a video message 
expressing his hope that the supreme court decision in the missouri 
case will favor their position 
while the court has yet to decide i hope the justices will 
give the democratic representatives of the people the state 
legislatures and the congress the power to restore legal protection 
to the unborn bush said we may not prevail today or tomorrow 
but make no mistake about it we will prevail

constitutional amendment to ban flag burning 
the president spoke before a hastily assembled crowd at a 
ceremony at the iwo jima memorial the statue of five marines 
raising the flag on a pacific island during world war ii 
bush used the ceremony to register his support for a 
republicandrafted proposed amendment that asserts the congress 
and the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration 
of the flag of the united states

leaders with the support of some democrats was simple stark and

the wait for the supreme courts latest word on 
abortion rights will last through the weekend 
the court prolonged the drama surrounding its most closely 
watched case of the 1980s by postponing until monday any word in an 
abortion dispute from missouri 
in it the justices are being asked to reverse the courts 1973 
decision legalizing abortion 
scores of partisans who had gathered on the court buildings 
front steps voiced disappointment thursday 
olivia gans of the national right to life committee said it is 
difficult to wait but we remain optimistic 
faye wattleton president of planned parenthood said further 
delay would be an indication of the turmoil that this court is 
willing to create in this country 
randall terry national director of an antiabortion group called 
operation rescue said if i was a supreme court justice i would 
throw the decision off the airplane as i was leaving the country 
before beginning its threemonth summer recess the court must 
deal with three cases awaiting decision 
in each the court must announce a decision or order the case 
reargued if it chooses the latter course a new round of arguments 
would be held during the court term that begins in october with 
announcement of a decision likely in 1990 
court officials refused all comment on the prospect of a monday 
decision in the missouri case which is called webster vs 
reproductive health services and in the absence of any hard facts 
rumors abounded 
abc news reported that justice harry a blackmun who wrote the 
courts 1973 decision may have asked chief justice william h 
rehnquist for more time to complete a bitter opinion in the 
webster case 
however a supreme court source who spoke only on condition on 
anonymity told the associated press today that blackmuns writing 
is not holding things up 
abortionrights advocates fear the court will order the missouri 
case reargued next term and do so in a way that signals the justices 
are contemplating a major retreat from the 1973 ruling in roe vs 
wade 
in that decision the court said women have a constitutional 
right to abortion 
if reargument is ordered the court also could agree to review up 
to three other abortion disputes pending before the justices that 
would be read by some as a tipoff the court was on the verge of a 
sweeping ruling 
the three cases from illinois ohio and minnesota all involve 
state regulations making abortions harder to get 
the justices met behind closed doors in a regularly scheduled 
conference thursday after their public session 
attorney general william webster said thursday in jefferson city 
mo he was not reading anything into the delay webster who argued 
in favor of upholding the missouri law said hope springs 
eternal anybody who wants it to come to a certain way can write 
into this delay great optimism 
roe vs wade itself was a case that had to be argued twice before 
a decision was announced the court hears arguments in about 150 
cases each term and since 1977 has held over at least one case each 
year for reargument the following term 
the 1973 ruling said a womans decision to have an abortion 
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and 
her doctor it said states may regulate abortions during the second 
trimester only to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however 
in the past decade about 15 million legal abortions have been 
performed each year 
if roe vs wade were reversed states would be free to 
stringently regulate or even outlaw abortion 
in the two decisions the court did announce thursday it 
gave public officials more authority to ban advertising and 
sales pitches including tupperware parties in college 
dormitories the 63 ruling in a new york case significantly limited 
commercial free speech 
limited in a case from washington state the power of indian 
tribes to control through tribal zoning laws the use of land owned 
by nonindians within a reservations boundaries 
the two other cases in which decisions are pending include an 
important churchstate dispute from pittsburgh focusing on holiday 
displays of a christmas nativity scene and a hanukkah menorah at 
government buildings 
the court also is expected to decide in a case from arkansas and 
florida whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax 
as unconstitutional is entitled to be refunded the money it paid 
before the tax was invalidated

said 
syrian gunners deployed in moslem west beirut concentrated their 
shelling on the coastline north of the city to maintain a blockade 
of the christian enclave a police spokesman said 
gunners of christian gen michel aoun responded by firing at 
syrian army batteries along west beiruts seaside boulevard said 
the spokesman who customarily is not identified by name

coastline despite a truce called may 26 by arab leaders 
police said early today that four people were wounded in the 
latest clashes but they said two of them later died 
by police count 382 people have been killed and 1499 wounded in

decisions they want previously aides said he opposed the idea of 
legislators meeting in another country 
also today a clandestine group warned cyprus not to give severe 
penalties to six lebanese charged with plotting to assassinate aoun 
we believe it is highly unlikely that the cypriot court trying 
our strugglers will take a biased attitude and issue severe 
sentences but if it does then we shall be compelled to deal with 
the republic of cyprus as an adverse party in the current conflict 
in lebanon a spokesman for the march 14 organization identified

morning for three crewmen missing after an oildrilling vessel 
capsized in the gulf of mexico but they were unable to enter the 
ship and got no response when they tapped on the hull officials 
said 
a fourth man on a fishing vessel helping in the search fell 
overboard and also is missing said lt don merwin with the us

further measures were being taken at the site at midmorning 
the three missing workers are believed trapped within the 
drilling equipment

legs that can be jacked down to the sea bed for oil exploration 
the fishing vessel captain gabriel reported the capsized rig at 
about 715 pm thursday in 90 feet of water about 26 miles south of

tamil rebels ambushed and killed five 
indian soldiers in the northeastern jungles but lost three of their 
own men in the battle military officials said today 
the militants however said they killed seven soldiers in 
thursdays attack at nayaru village in mullaitivu district 170 
miles northeast of colombo their statement did not give guerrilla 
casualties 
military officials who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules said 10 more rebels were killed by indian troops in separate 
skirmishes thursday in batticaloa in the east and jaffna and 
vavuniya in the north 
indian diplomats said they were not immediately aware of the 
clashes which reportedly occurred a few hours before president 
ranasinghe premadasa asked india to halt military operations against 
tamil rebels and withdraw its 45000 troops 
the rebels from the dominant liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
group are holding peace talks with the sri lankan government to 
resolve their demands for a separate homeland on tuesday the two 
sides declared a ceasefire in the sixyear war that has claimed 
9000 lives but the rebels made no promises about attacks on indian 
soldiers 
new delhi today repeated previous refusals to stop fighting until 
the insurgents surrender their arms 
an indian foreign ministry statement said the latest 
announcement is meaningless unless it reflects the liberation 
tigers commitment to the unity and integrity of sri lanka and to 
the giving up of violence not only against the sri lankan 
government but also against fellow tamils and other communities in 
the northeast province 
the deployment of the indian troops is causing friction between 
colombo and new delhi 
the troops arrived two years ago to disarm rebels under an 
indiansponsored accord but soon the militants launched a 
counteroffensive in which at least 800 indian soldiers and 1500 
rebels have been killed 
tamils want to set up an independent nation in the northeast 
where most of them live and where they are a majority they allege 
discrimination in jobs and education by sinhalese who comprise 75 
percent of the countrys 16 million people most sinhalese are 
buddhists and tamils are mainly hindu

it has turned out in our favor for we still have a large group 
of veterans who have experienced many storms and have a thorough 
understanding of things they are on the side of taking resolute 
action to counter the turmoil although some comrades may not 
understand this now they will understand eventually and will 
support the decision of the communist party central committee 
the april 26 editorial of the peoples daily classified the 
problem as turmoil the word was appropriate but some people 
objected to the word and tried to amend it but what happened showed 
that this verdict was right 
it was also inevitable that the turmoil would develop into a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion we still have a group of senior 
comrades who are alive we still have the army and we also have a 
group of core cadres who took part in the revolution at various 
times that is why it was relatively easy for us to handle the 
present matter 
the main difficulty in handling this matter lay in that we had 
never experienced such a situation before in which a small minority 
of bad people mixed with so many young students and onlookers 
what we faced was not just some ordinary people who were 
misguided but also a rebellious clique and a large number of the 
dregs of society the key point is that they wanted to overthrow our 
state and the party 
they had two main slogans to overthrow the communist party and 
topple the socialist system their goal was to establish a bourgeois 
republic entirely dependent on the west their real aim was to 
overthrow the communist party and topple the socialist system 
although it is very sad that so many comrades were sacrificed if 
the event is analyzed objectively people cannot but recognize that 
the pla are the sons and brothers of the people this will also help 
people to understand the measures we used in the course of the 
struggle in the future whenever the pla faces problems and takes 
measures it will gain the support of the people 
in a word this was a test and we passed even though there are 
not so many veteran comrades in the army and the soldiers are mostly 
little more than 18 19 or 20 years of age they are still true 
soldiers of the people facing danger they did not forget the 
people the teachings of the party and the interests of the country 
they kept a resolute stand in the face of death they fully deserve 
the saying that they met death and sacrificed themselves with 
generosity and without fear 
what they crossed this time was genuinely a political barrier a 
threshold of life and death this is by no means easy this shows 
that the peoples army is truly a great wall of iron and steel of 
the party and country 
this shows that no matter how heavy the losses we suffer and no 
matter how generations change this army of ours is forever an army 
under te leadership of the party 
in political reforms we can affirm one point we have to insist 
on implementing the system of the national peoples congress and not 
the american system of the separation of three powers the us 
berates us for suppressing students but when they handled domestic 
student unrest and turmoil didnt they send out police and troops 
arrest people and shed blood they were suppressing students and the 
people but we are putting down counterrevolutionary rebellion what 
qualifications do they have to criticize us 
we must conscientiously sum up our experiences persevere in what 
is right correct what is wrong and do a bit more where we lag 
behind in short we should sum up the experiences of the present 
and look forward to the future

prime minister charles haughey irelands 
great political survivor has resigned after parliament narrowly 
refused to reelect him 
haughey 63 stepped down thursday but said he would try to gain 
support from the sixseat progressive democratic party before making 
a new bid for election by the dail or parliament 
the 166member dail adjourned thursday until monday 
haughey said he would stay on as caretaker prime minister and not 
ask president patrick hillery to dissolve parliament and call an 
election 
his resignation was seen as a formality enforced by demands from 
two opposing parties the fine gael and the leftwing labor party 
that he follow constitutional procedure 
haughey whose political astuteness and staying power have long 
confounded opponents was rebuffed when legislators rejected his 
nomination in an 8678 vote 
he had failed in his gamble to call an election june 15 in hopes 
of winning an outright parliamentary majority 
the 81seat minority government elected 28 months ago by the 
slimmest margin possible lost four seats in the june vote 
haugheys fianna fail party which has governed ireland for 44 of 
its 67 years as an independent state was again denied the chance to 
form the first singleparty majority government since 197781 
haughey appears to be calculating that the opposition will want 
to avoid another election and the progressive democrats will support 
him rather than risk blame for steering the country into greater 
constitutional disarray 
other candidates have little hope of winning a majority to form a 
government 
haughey has won and lost office twice and has weathered a slew of 
scandals economic problems and party infighting he is dubbed the 
great survivor 
after his 1987 victory haughey adopted economic remedies once 
advocated by his opponents to cut irelands borrowing and end a 
recession 
but critics complain the measures have not reached many of the 
poor and the young unemployment remains at 179 percent and 
emigration is at its highest level in three decades

the chief mate of the greek tanker that 
ran aground on brenton reef apologized today for the accident that 
spilled 420000 gallons of heating oil into narragansett bay 
the only thing i have to say is that the captain is one of the 
best captains i ever saw on board in the years of my experience on 
boats georgios vlahos told a federal board of inquiry 
i am very sorry for this happening i dont know what else to 
say i think it was a very bad time and all else is in your hands 
he said 
vlahos 27 was granted federal immunity to get him to testify 
before the coast guardnational transportation safety board inquiry 
into the june 23 accident off newport the helmsman also was given 
immunity 
a grand jury is investigating possible violations of a state law 
requiring a harbor pilot on board vessels inside a line from point 
judith to sakkonet point 
the world prodigy had no pilot on board when it ran aground 
inside the area in which the state requires a pilot 
vlahos said the world prodigy was on the slowest speed possible 
dead slow when it ran aground the mate said he had just returned 
to the bridge and was unsure what the ships exact speed was or its 
course in the moments before the accident he said the captain 
iakovos georgudis had made many turns during his approach to 
narragansett bay to avoid small boats in the area 
recreating the vessels course and speed before the accident 
will be a major part of the investigation said richard johnson one 
of two safety board investigators hearing the case 
georgudis 43 remained confined aboard ship in lieu of 50000 
bail on federal pollution charges 
on thursday a commerce department guide titled united states 
coast pilot was entered as evidence at the hearing the guide 
advises foreign ships and us vessels on foreign trips that they 
need to board a pilot outside the line from point judith to sakkonet 
point before entering the bay 
but it also says pilots board at the brenton reef light tower 
about 1 miles inside the line said lt cmdr theo moniz iii of the 
coast guard marine safety office in providence 
norman lidstone coxswain of the boat that brought pilot david 
leonard to the tanker said that although most pilots meet their 
ships 1 to 1 miles southeast of the tower some ships whose 
captains are familiar with the area meet pilots closer to the reef 
outbound ships sometimes let pilots off 2 miles north of the 
tower inside the bay near the castle hill coast guard station 
lidstone said 
in the wake of other oil spills last weekend developments 
included 
delaware filed a federal lawsuit thursday against the captain 
of the presidente rivera raul dibarrart as an agent of the 
uruguayan government which owns the ship the suit charges the 
tanker violated delawares pollution laws the uruguayan tanker ran 
aground early saturday spilling 306684 gallons of heavy heating 
fuel according to coast guard estimates delaware officials said 
the cleanup was progressing well 
in texas witnesses testified at a coast guard inquiry that a 
collision between a panamanian tanker and a barge last week might 
have been avoided if not for a buildup of sediment in the bayport 
channel the collision resulted in 250000 gallons of oil being 
spilled into galveston bay the us army corps of engineers 
confirmed the channel does have a buildup of sediment according to 
the houston chronicle 
at the rhode island hearing lidstone said the world prodigy 
first radioed it was 2 miles from the rendezvous and confirmed 
leonards account of trying to warn the tanker away from the rocks 
the next thing i saw was his bow raising out of the water in 
slow motion so to say as the ship ran aground lidstone said 
lidstone said the world prodigy looked like he was closing 
pretty fast or faster than normal but he could not say if it was 
too fast 
the coast guard has estimated cleanup costs at 16 million 
crews have finished unloading nearly 8 million gallons of oil that 
remained on board and are waiting for a salvage plan from the ships 
owner ballard shipping co said lt paul wolf

united mine workers leaders are urging 
striking members to remain peaceful in their efforts to force the 
pittston coal group inc to sign a contract 
about 1500 umw members gathered this morning for what had been 
billed as a rally at a football field the meeting was moved into 
logan memorial field house and union officials barred reporters 
danny wells who becomes a umw district 17 international board 
member saturday said the miners wanted to discuss certain matters 
in private he would not say what those issues were 
four coal trucks in west virginia and virginia have been hit by 
bullets this week and two others damaged by steel balls fired from 
slingshots police said striking pittston employees and wildcat 
sympathy strikers blocked traffic on coalhauling roads thursday no 
arrests were reported but pittston said a security employee 
suffered a cut on his head in a confrontation 
we are doing our best to make sure our people are still in a 
nonviolent frame of mind said roger horton vice president of 
umw local 5958 in dehue we cannot win with any type of violence 
horton was an organizer of the meeting today in support of 1900 
union members on strike against pittston in west virginia virginia 
and kentucky 
at elkem metals co in alloy this morning 300 members of the 
oil chemical and atomic workers union walked off the job for half 
an hour in support of the pittston strikers 
were willing to tolerate it if its limited to 30 minutes 
said gary moore the plants employee relations manager 
the pittston workers went on strike peacefully in april after 14 
months without a contract but there have been scattered violent 
incidents since thousands of union miners in appalachia and the 
midwest went on a wildcat strike in sympathy with the pittston 
workers 2 weeks ago 
union and coal company officials estimate about 37000 miners in 
eight states are on strike although the start of the traditional 
summer vacation period this week has made it difficult to determine 
precise numbers states affected include alabama illinois indiana 
kentucky ohio pennsylvania tennessee and west virginia 
the umw has not publicly sanctioned the sympathy walkout and has 
urged wildcatters to go back to work 
the head of west virginias thirdleading coal producer 
frustrated that umw officials wont answer his phone calls says he 
blames the shutdown on the union 
as far as im concerned im for calling this contract null and 
void right now said paul kiser president of beckleybased maben 
energy corp if the union cant live up to its agreement what 
good is it 
danny wells a umw district spokesman said maben energy remains 
under contract until 1993 
companies havent been living up to their contracts with the 
union either wells said but we still have an agreement mr 
kiser will find that pulling out of his contract will be easier said 
than done 
the pittston miners have concentrated on the companys withdrawal 
from a national contract to win work rule changes it says are 
necessary to meet competition from foreign producers 
the strikes focus has turned to health benefits in recent days 
though pittston has refused to contribute to two health plans and 
two related retirement funds since its contract with the umw expired 
in february 1988 court documents show 
the union and the umw health and retirement funds have filed 
lawsuits against the company umw spokesman john duray estimates 
pittston owes as much as 10 million to the umw health and benefits 
fund a figure pittston wouldnt confirm the charleston daily mail 
reported thursday 
documents show that the two health plans spent more money than 
they earned last year and the daily mail said both funds continue 
to lose money 
pittston lawyer john wood contends pittston had the right to pull 
out of the benefit plans when its umw contract expired in february 
1988

military forces said they seized power 
today by overthrowing the civilian government of prime minister 
sadek elmahdi no casualties were reported 
the coup leadership suspended the constitution placed the 
country under a state of emergency and declared a nighttime curfew 
in the capital khartoum egypts middle east news agency reported 
from khartoum parliament and political parties were disbanded and 
newspaper licenses revoked it said 
the agency identified the coup leader as omar hassan ahmed 
elbashir and said he signed the decrees the whereabouts of 
elmahdi was not known 
elbashir has been the thirdranking officer in the paratroop 
corps and previously commanded a unit in southern sudan according 
to the report 
elbashir appeared to be the same person as a man identified as 
brig gen omar hassan who announced the coup on official radio 
omdurman 
paratroop and armored units staged the coup according to the 
agency and it indicated the coup leaders were not from the top 
echelons of the sudanese military command the coup leaders have 
designated the general command and army leaders as the former 
command it said 
soldiers occupied the presidential palace cabinet offices radio 
omdurman and the official sudan news agency khartoum international 
airport and sudanese airspace were declared closed 
the agency said some political figures and cabinet ministers 
were arrested but it was uncertain if they included elmahdi who 
became prime minister after a may 1986 general election 
a western diplomat in addis ababa ethiopia said he had heard 
the coup leaders tried to arrest the prime minister at his home in 
khartoum but that elmahdi escaped 
a military statement said the coup was launched because political 
parties failed to lead the nation 
in february the military said it would move against elmahdi 
unless he ended sudans sixyear civil war by accepting a tentative 
peace pact worked out between an opposition party and southern 
rebels the war has contributed to food riots widespread hunger in 
the south and a severe refugee problem 
the whereabouts of former president gaafar nimeiri accused by 
the military june 18 of being behind a failed coup was not known 
nimeiri was overthrown in 1985 and said recently he planned to 
return to sudan to seize power 
sudan the largest country in africa has about 22 million 
residents it is a poor predominantly islamic country roughly 
onethird the size of the continental united states 
the military has ruled sudan for about 23 years of its 33 years 
of independence 
gili farah a sudan news agency journalist said there were no 
reports of violence during or after the coup 
traffic was banned on bridges spanning the white nile and the 
blue nile but the capital of 2 million appeared otherwise normal 
for the moslem sabbath no celebrations or demonstrations were 
evident 
omdurman radio went off the air early today but resumed 
transmissions at 8 am with martial music 
the june revolution has come to restore to the sudanese citizen 
his injured dignity and rebuild the sudan of the future the 
agency quoted the radio as saying 
the middle east news agency said the coup leaders identified 
themselves as the command council of the national salvation 
revolution banned political opposition and political gatherings and 
would issue all major legislative and executive decrees its 
chairman is to serve as prime minister defense minister and armed 
forces commanderinchief it said 
a text of a statement on the radio read by brig gen hassan and 
also distributed by the middle east news agency said soldiers 
staged the coup because elmahdi had wasted the countrys time and 
squandered its energies 
elmahdi 53 became the countrys first civilian leader in 17 
years when his umma party won general elections 37 months ago he 
replaced a transitional military government that overthrew nimeiri 
in april 1985 
his government was dogged by the rebellion of the sudan peoples 
liberation army which began under nimeiri and exacerbated by 
famine and flood has caused economic disarray in sudan 
even after the famine ended with rains two years ago hundreds of 
thousands of southern sudanese died last year because the war kept 
them from their fields or drove them from their homes in search of 
shelter 
both sides have used food and control of relief supplies as 
weapons in the conflict over the northernercontrolled governments 
economic political and administrative policies toward the south 
the armed forces announced on june 18 that supporters of nimeiri 
had tried a coup but failed later reports from khartoum said 
several dozen military officers and civilians were arrested in the 
coup attempt 
nimeiri a political refugee in cairo since he was overthrown 
denied he was behind that coup attempt but he said in an interview 
last week that he intended to return to sudan and expressed 
confidence he would regain power 
on sunday a nimeiri aide in cairo said the former president had 
left egypt two days earlier the aide refused to disclose nimeiris 
destination 
todays coup announcement gave no indication that the former 
president was involved

federal prosecutors are investigating an 
alleged homosexual prostitution ring that catered to political 
figures including a labor department official who resigned when the 
investigation was made public 
the investigation is based on financial records and other 
material seized in raids on a house in an upscale washington 
neighborhood that police say was used by escort services with names 
such as dream boys and man to man 
us attorney jay stephens on thursday confirmed the 
investigation into allegedly fraudulent multiple billings of the 
services patrons after the washington times reported that the ring 
was patronized by reagan and bush administration officials 
congressional aides and one of its own former editors 
one of a handful of individuals named in the times article paul 
r balach resigned thursday evening 
i hereby resign my position this date due to the public 
disclosure of activities concerning my personal life balach said 
in a letter announcing his resignation as labor secretary elizabeth 
doles political personnel liaison to the white house 
the times quoted balach as saying department solicitor robert 
davis told him he had a choice of resigning or being fired he said 
he was not allowed to talk to mrs dole about the matter 
they promised me that they would try and find me another 
position somewhere in the government but i just dont know 
somebody else is going to clean out my office they didnt want me 
to come back into the office balach said 
balach told the times that thousands of dollars in charges were 
run up on his credit cards without his knowledge after he used the 
service 
the times said another of the rings clients was so politically 
wellconnected that he was able to arrange a middleofthe night 
tour of the white house in july 1988 for a group including two male 
prostitutes 
secret service agents and district of columbia police raided the 
escort service house in northwest washington on two occasions in 
february and may 
in applying for search warrants district police detective gerald 
w robertson said the investigation had produced probable cause to 
believe that records and evidence related to an interstate 
prostitution business were located there 
stephens refused to talk about allegations of the homosexual 
ring but said in a statement that his office has been 
investigating alegations involving credit card fraud arising from 
the execution of those warrants 
during the raids officers confiscated multiline telephones 
paging devices credit card imprinters numerous bank statements 
credit card slips and a diary of the escort business according to 
an inventory filed in us district court 
the times said it has obtained a number of credit card slips and 
it identified individuals who paid for services including balach 
labor department sources said balach initially decided thursday 
morning to take a few days annual leave after being named by the 
times as a patron of the escort services he resigned thursday 
evening 
in an interview before his resignation was announced balach 
said i have been a victim im cooperating fully ive talked 
several times with the secret service he declined to elaborate 
but said the times had published an accurate account of the 
turmoil ive been through the last few months 
the times quoted unnamed witnesses and law enforcement agents as 
saying the secret service kept one box of seized files containing 
names and other information about highlevel government officials 
who were clients of the escort businesses 
law enforcement officials familiar with the probe said 
investigators have obtained credit card receipts and phone logs 
linking additional political figures to the prostitution ring the 
officials refused to be quoted by name or provide additional details 
robert snow a spokesman for the secret service said its agents 
are working for stephens he said the us attorney will present the 
case to a grand jury 
the times said stanley mark tapscott one of its former assistant 
managing editors was among those who used the escort services 
tapscott who resigned june 20 said he had not paid for sexual 
services of any kind but was conducting an investigation into 
dialaporn services the paper said its editors were unaware of any 
such reporting assignment 
another individual identified by the times as a patron of the 
escort services was charles k dutcher former associate director of 
presidential personnel in the reagan administration dutcher now a 
private consultant told the newspaper that stress drove him to 
seek out a male prostitute once 
calls to dutchers home were not answered and he did not 
immediately return messages left on his answering machine

trustees of a chicago art school where two recent 
exhibits including one of a us flag on the floor caused heated 
protests have issued strict new guidelines allowing for removal of 
disruptive student artworks 
under guidelines released thursday the school of the art 
institute of chicago can relocate or remove any exhibit that may 
violate the law or be hazardous to the health and or safety of 
viewers or participants 
the guidelines formulated by a committee of students teachers 
and administrators also give the school the authority to determine 
when if how long and where students art will be shown 
displays that may be disruptive to the educational process 
can be relocated or removed the rules say 
marshall field v president of the board of trustees spelled out 
the new policy in a letter to board members 
a long debate in arriving at the guidelines shows the extreme 
difficulty of balancing personal freedom of expression in an 
educational environment with responsiblities to community 
concerns and public sensitivities field wrote 
the art institute has been the site of protests within the past 
two years over two student exhibits one that included an american 
flag on the floor where it could be walked on and the other a 
painting of the late mayor harold washington in womens 
undergarments 
harvey grossman legal director of the american civil liberties 
union in illinois said the guideline governing health and safety 
hazards is particularly vague and could result in chilling and 
inhibiting student creativity and expression 
grossman said school officials should explain to students just 
what that standard means im sure they intend to do that 
among those angered by the flag exhibit were members of the 
illinois legislature who added a provision to the bill on state 
arts council funds this spring specifying that the art institute get 
only 1 during the fiscal year that begins saturday a spokesman for 
gov james thompson has said he will probably veto that section of 
the bill

the united states and soviet union have agreed on 
inspection procedures for chemical arms sites that will be included 
in a draft proposal for a global ban on the weapons a soviet 
official said today 
but the chief us delegate to the talks max friedersdorf said 
the soviet statements appeared to be premature and exaggerated 
he declined to comment on the substance of the talks which ended 
thursday while the latest round brought some progress 
fundamental differences remain he said 
the soviet official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity also said progress should not be overrated 
im not saying now that we have this document we can sign the 
convention tomorrow he said 
the chemical weapons talks began in 1986 after the first summit 
between thenpresident reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the latest round the first under the bush administration lasted 
three weeks the soviet official said the talks will resume later 
this year 
he said the superpowers moved toward an accord on exchanging data 
on chemical weapons sites including factories and military depots 
and that they were in virtual agreement on provisions for the 
destruction of such arms under a global ban 
while the talks apply only to the superpowers the official said 
an accord would be designed to speed progress toward a global ban 
he said the two governments plan to submit agreements on 
inspections and destruction of chemical weapon stocks to the 
40nation geneva conference on disarmament 
the official said the inspection procedures worked out after 
months of disagreement include mandatory shortnotice checks of 
chemical weapons sites by an international team of experts if a 
country is accused of violating a ban

a new york city high school has thrown out 
the results of a math regents test because about 40 percent of the 
students taking it apparently cheated education officials said 
its the first test to be invalidated in a growing school 
cheating scandal that erupted last week when a newspaper published 
the answer key of a regents chemistry exam to illustrate a busy 
black market in stolen exams the chemistry test was subsequently 
canceled 
more invalidations are expected as test results are calculated 
state education department spokesman christopher carpenter said 
thursday 
of the 504 students at the public benjamin cardozo high school in 
queens who took the test a review of results showed about 100 
clearly cheated said principal bertram linder 
school officials were told even honors students cheated although 
this is tougher to trace by the results he said linder said he 
believes about 200 students mostly sophomores cheated 
we saw a great deal of evidence that the youngsters have had 
access to answer keys so much so that not to take action would be 
giving kids the wrong message linder said 
seven students caught with evidence of cheating have been 
disciplined 
the math test invalidated at cardozo was given the same day the 
new york post saying regents tests were being actively bought and 
sold around new york city high schools published the answers to the 
chemistry test on its front page education officials had denounced 
the post for printing the answers 
in todays editions the newspaper reported that 24 students in 
queens including honors students from public and private high 
schools have admitted to investigators that they sold answers to 
the regents exams 
two students admitted trying to sell a package of four tests to 
two teenage gangs for 4500 the post said citing unidentified 
sources 
regents tests given in 17 subjects over a twoweek period 
generally account for about 25 percent of a students grade in the 
case of the canceled cardozo test students can take a retest or 
simply have classroom results account for their full grade linder

the philadelphia inquirer reduced optimism in utah that the suns energy 
source can be produced at room temperature as fusion research moves 
ahead with the help of general electric 
the university of utah and ge announced wednesday that their 
scientists will collaborate in attempts to verify and explain the 
widely disputed findings announced in march by university chemist b

the collaboration is the first such agreement the university has 
made with a major corporation but doesnt rule out similar 
arrangements with other companies said james brophy the schools 
vice president for research 
pons and fleischmann maintain they were able in a tabletop 
experiment to produce more than 100 times the energy needed to 
produce it 
some researchers at other laboratories have duplicated parts of 
the experiment but ames laboratory officials said in ames iowa 
that they had been unable to produce results similar to those 
claimed by pons and fleischmann

chemistry at iowa state university and director of the federal 
laboratory said i was just as excited as everybody else when the 
revelations were made 
i thought our energy crisis was over he said 
we explored the findings to the limits of our equipment and 
expertise he said wednesday im sorry to say we detected 
nothing it would have been exciting

longer thinking of cold fusion as a source of energy but he said 
academics will continue looking into the matter

the food and drug administration said today it 
is investigating a new york drug manufacturer that a house 
subcommittee alleges falsified tests to win approval for its generic 
version of a drug used to treat high blood pressure 
the house energy and commerce investigations subcommittee alleges 
that a generic version of dyazide made by vitarine pharmaceuticals 
inc of springfield gardens ny was sold to the public for more 
than a year without undergoing full safety tests 
vitarine recalled the drug earlier this month because of concerns 
that faulty data may have been submitted to the fda in an 
application for approval of the drug 
the subcommittee in a letter to vitarine on thursday said it 
had learned the company told fda officials that instead of using the 
vitarine generic for comparison tests with the originally 
forumulated dyazide the company substituted dyazide for its product 
the result the subcommittee said was that a sample of dyazide 
was tested against another sample of dyazide and the vitarine 
sample was never measured against the original to see if it is 
absorbed into the body at the same rate and to the same extent as 
dyazide 
the new information raises serious concerns about the safety 
of vitarines product said rep john dingell dmich in a letter 
to the fda he is chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee 
the drug the vitarine generic is not what was tested so you 
dont have any idea whether it is safe said a subcommittee 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the fda is in the middle of an ongoing investigation of 
vitarine and it would be improper to comment any further at this 
time said spokesman jeff nesbit asked whether the fda had safety 
concerns about dyazide or either of its generic versions he said 
no but added i really cant speak to that 
asked about dingells allegations alan kaplan a washington 
attorney representing vitarine said this is a matter that is 
being investigated and vitarine has advised the fda of this 
possibility its still under investigation theres no definite 
conclusion at this time 
he said the investigation involves certain products in which 
certain people have been working and at least three vitarine 
employees have been suspended 
dyazide made by smithkline beckman corp is one of the most 
widely prescribed drugs in the country before its first generic 
competition appeared in 1987 sales were more than 300 million 
annually however after the first generic competition made by 
bolar pharmaceutical came on the market smithklines dyazide sales 
dropped 45 percent to 200 million in 1988 said smithkline 
spokesman jeremy heymsfeld 
vitarines generic version won fda approval in february 1988 
the subcommittee said the allegations against vitarine also raise 
questions about bolars generic version and smithklines original 
a subcommittee source said the tests showed that the two samples 
were not identicial even though smithklines original product 
allegedly was being compared with itself instead of with the 
vitarine generic drug 
gene pfeifer an attorney for bolar and a former fda lawyer said 
such differences are not unusual because of the nature of the tests 
he said bolar is confident that its product is safe 
jeremy heymsfeld a smithkline spokesman also expressed his 
companys confidence in the safety and effectiveness of its product 
which he said has been demonstrated in millions of patients for 
more than 20 years 
the subcommittee asked pharmakinetics of baltimore md the 
laboratory that conducted the tests comparing vitarines product and 
bolars version with the smithkline original to hold all samples of 
the drugs 
mark perkal executive vice president of pharmakinetics said the 
company was cooperating with the agency he said there was no way 
the lab would have known whether a company submitted false test 
samples were not in the business to detect fraud he said 
the comparison studies are one of two major tests key to the 
fdas approval of a generic lowercost version of a prescription 
drug the bioequivalence tests which are the ones at issue in the 
vitarine case examine the rate and extent of absorption of the drug 
to determine whether it works with the same effectiveness as the 
original to be approved as a generic version a drug must also 
undergo a chemical review of its active ingredients 
dingells subcommittee has been conducting an investigation into 
alleged bribery in the fdas generic drug division the justice 
department also is investigating the allegations 
an fda source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
agency doubts vitarines product is unsafe because it had undergone 
a chemical review and it had no reports of any problems with anyone 
who used the drug

cardinal frantisek tomasek 
celebrated his 90th birthday friday amid greetings from church 
leaders and dissidents as well as the communist authorities he has 
pressed for more religious freedom 
his mere existence is important for believers said the rev 
vaclav maly who was banned from preaching in churches in 1979 
because he helped form the charter 77 human rights group 
they know somebody from the church hierarchy is there to defend 
them he is a symbol of confidence courage and the authentic 
defense of religious rights maly said 
jan lebeda a bishop of prague wrote in the catholic newspaper 
peoples democracy that tomasek is among the noble people of our 
times 
a day earlier communist party leader milos jakes congratulated 
tomasek but asked him to support socialist goals in czechoslovakia 
dissident playwright vaclav havel and alexander dubcek the 
communist party leader during the failed 1968 prague spring 
reform period also wished the cardinal well 
havel met with tomasek on thursday and dubcek visited the 
cardinal on wednesday according to activist sources 
tomasek advocates less state supervision of church affairs in 
this rigidly controlled communist nation and his often daring 
comments on the topic have made him a symbol of hope among catholics 
the state must eventually accept and respect the public 
expression of the religious faithful tomasek said in an interview 
with the west german newspaper die welt published on june 18 
in the same interview tomasek complained the study of theology 
in czechoslovakia is burdened with difficulty 
communist officials frequently crack down on political human 
rights activists if they go too far with their public statements 
but they have tolerated tomasek because of his religious leadership 
the latest hint of a impending political crackdown came friday 
when the communist party newspaper rude pravo responded to a 
petition by czechoslovak activists to allow peaceful demonstrations 
free all political prisoners and reassess the 1968 sovietled 
invasion that crushed dubceks reforms 
rude pravo told the activists patience has its limits 
tomasek became a bishop in 1949 and two years later was arrested 
and interned during a communist crackdown on religious practice he 
was freed in 1954 
he was named cardinal in june 1977 and archbishop of prague that 
december 
a mass was scheduled saturday at pragues st vitus cathedral to 
celebrate tomaseks birthday the cardinal was expected to deliver a 
short address 
dozens of foreign dignitaries and highranking chuch officials 
from other countries as well as thousands of czechoslovaks were 
expected at the ceremony 
church officials say about half of the 15 million people in 
czechoslovakia officially an atheist state are catholics

a fourth of july fascination with bangs booms 
and sparkles has southern california authorities on edge as a 
worsening drought kicks in an early wildfire season 
the problem we have this year is that weve reached the 
critical stage right before july fourth and its hard to keep people 
from bringing in the fireworks said terry molzahn of the us 
forest service 
flames crackling through tinderdry brush in mountains near lake 
elsinore 60 miles southeast of los angeles and the antelope valley 
briefly forced thousands of residents to flee infernos in recent 
days 
the fires have blackened about 10000 acres and have destroyed 
eight homes the largest blaze near lake elsinore was reported 90 
percent contained by this morning and firefighters hoped to 
surround it completely by later today 
with the amount of dead material or dieback we have and the 
moisture content of the brush we are today where we should be at 
the end of august said los angeles city fire battalion chief bob 
neamy 
rangers in the 647000acre angeles national forest will be 
stopping all vehicles entering the forest this holiday weekend to 
check for fireworks said us forest service spokesman george a 
roby 
some cities permit the sale and use of socalled safe and 
sane fireworks which include sparklers and other nonexplosives 
its the illegal fireworks most smuggled in from mexico that alarm 
firefighters 
we dont recommend any type of fireworks use for the public 
said neamy whose department recommends attending one of the many 
fireworks presentations in parks stadiums and along the coast 
we dont want to take apple pie and the american flag away we 
dont think fireworks are bad if they are conducted by professionals 
in a show said city fire spokesman gary svider 
all fireworks including the type that exploded tuesday in a 
koreatown apartment and injured several police officers have been 
forbidden in los angeles since 1942 
firecrackers skyrockets and other aerial displays are prohibited 
in california the only exception occurring during the chinese new 
year when chinese business associations are allowed to set off 
firecrackers in ethnic and religious celebrations 
last year illegal fireworks were responsible for 146 fires and 
59 injuries in los angeles 
in santa monica the annual july fourth celebration was changed 
to the early morning hours several years ago because nighttime 
street gang fights marred the festivities 
we hope they will be too sleepy to cause too much trouble 
said sharon rose of the city arts commission 
in the 8200acre lake elsinore blaze 11 cabins and homes 
counting mobile homes were destroyed authorities said much 
progress was made thursday in fighting the manmade fire an 
investigation was under way to determine if the fire was arson 
we got a super day in today getting a line around this 
barton ball of the us forest service said late thursday 
everybody is back in their homes 
ball said though the burned areas were a ghastly sight it 
looks like something from outer space out there he said 
in the antelope valley 45 miles north of los angeles meanwhile 
firefighters declared that 2250acre blaze contained thursday at 6

on an attempt to windsurf across the atlantic ocean leaving 
manhattan for la rochelle on the coast of france 
arnaud crussol 21 stood up on his board in the east river at 
1210 pm and immediately caught a breeze that propelled him toward 
new york harbor and the first leg of the monthlong journey 
just minutes into the trip he momentarily dropped his sail as a 
huge barge steamed by rocking the board and an accompanying 
catamaran 
weve been dreaming of leaving new york city from the bay 
crussol said before departing its a sunny day theres a wind a 
good direction wind so everything is ok 
he is one of four windsurfers who will take fourhour shirts 
sailing across the atlantic while a crew of five keeps an eye on 
them from the catamaran 
you ask why says windsurfer beatrice noel because its a 
great adventure this is something you can do when youre 22 and 
maybe later you dont have the time 
in all nine secondyear students at the institut superieur du 
commerce in paris are participating in the unusual summer project 
this teaches you responsibility on how to put together a 
package to get sponsors to work together the struggle of life 
laughed phillippe pauliac 22 as he helped with lastminute 
preparations at manhattans south street seaport on thursday for 
what the group expects will be a onemonth journey 
another windsurfer beatrice comby 21 says her parents at first 
couldnt believe her summer vacation plans 
but now they know we are well prepared we have been practicing 
hard comby said noting that the teams four windsurfers have 
worked out for more than a year and windsurfed in the english 
channel and the mediterranean sea 
the plan calls for each of the four windsurfers to sail daily 
fourhour shifts 
trailing them will be a hightech 40foot fiberglass catamaran 
skippered by laurent jandet and crewed by four other students when 
not in the water the surfers will rest and sleep on the boat which 
is equipped with a fascimile machine to receive weather maps and a 
desalination machine to produce potable water 
the school each year encourages a summer project unrelated to its 
business curriculum last year another group of secondyear 
students crossed australia in fourwheel vehicles next years group 
already is putting together a trek across the andes mountains 
programs like these cost a lot of francs thats where the 
students business skills come in as they have to secure their own 
corporate sponsors this years sponsors include a french bank a 
food company a radio station and windsurfing and wetsuit companies 
the windsurfing project was dreamed up last year by jandet the 
22yearold skipper 
asked why jandet talked about the lure of the ocean and the 
adventure of a challenge until one of his four boat crew members 
interrupted and said naw hes just a little crazy

doctors from africa and the united states 
agreed friday to cooperate but differed over whether their south 
african colleagues should be included 
the cooperation plan was adopted by representatives of the 
confederation of african medical associations and societies the 
american medical association the american orthopedics association 
and the international society on hypertension in blacks inc of 
atlanta 
doctors from 26 nations are attending the fiveday conference on 
hypertension among blacks that ends saturday 
james w reed director of public affair for the hypertension 
group said the physicians would share ideas hold exchanges for 
doctors and medical students and assist each other in training 
african physicians contacts with their us counterparts are 
primarily through their respective governments 
we think such exchanges would improve the standard of medicine 
in this continent and also may pave ways for more resources from 
the united states which is vital for africa said reed of 
seattle 
ray gifford of cleveland a member of the ama board said 
cooperation between african medical associations and their american 
counterparts would improve medical care in both regions 
i think contacts would benefit both american and african 
physicians to broaden their perspectives said gifford the amas 
official representative at the conference we can learn from them 
and they can learn from us and that way medical care would improve 
he reiterated the ama position that south african physicians 
should not be isolated 
the american medical association abhors apartheid gifford 
said we do not agree with what the south africans are doing but 
isolating south african doctors is bad for medicine 
oo adenkule of nigeria secretarygeneral of the 30nation 
confederation of african medical associations and societies 
disagreed with the amas stand 
we do not feel it is proper to deal with doctors who have not 
shown any concern for the inhumane conditions under which south 
africa blacks live he said 
the confederation was formed in 1982 after african medical 
associations quit the world medical association to protest south

no one will ever know why a pet cat mauled 
an 8yearold girl in a series of attacks that were finally stopped 
when two men wrestled the animal to the ground and strangled it an 
official said friday 
i would say its certainly going to be a mystery forever 
said microbiologist julie crosby at the department of human 
services laboratory in augusta the only thing we can say is it 
was negative for rabies 
sometimes cats just go nuts said the labs dr philip 
haines maybe somebody pulled its tail 
haines said the 3yearold cat gypsy could have gone crazy 
because of other ailments including distemper a brain tumor or an 
infection but the lab tested the cat only for rabies 
on monday gypsy attacked amy johnson several times clawing a 
1inch gash above her right eye that required four stitches amys 
father mike johnson came to the rescue by striking the cat with a 
mop handle 
the family was finally driven from its home for several hours 
upon their return the cat attacked the girl again so johnson 
called police 
when patrolman gary berg arrived the two men got the biting and 
scratching cat to the floor and johnson strangled it 
i was tired and the cat was freaking out and both of us were 
getting sliced and diced johnson said at the time i was afraid 
if i let her go she would kill me she had an evil look on her 
face

us ambassador melissa wells signed an 
agreement friday to provide a 400000 grant for a project to reduce 
infant and child mortality in a province hit by frequent rebel 
attacks 
mozambiques infant and child mortality rates are among the 
highest in the world unicef estimates that 325 to 375 of every 
1000 mozambican children die before their fifth birthday mostly 
because of a 12year guerrilla war in which crops are burned 
villages destroyed and convoys of trucks carrying relief aid 
attacked by guerrillas of the mozambican national resistance 
mrs wells said after signing the agreement with cooperation 
minister jacinto veloso that the document marks what we believe 
will be a fruitful collaboration between the united states and 
mozambique in adressing anew the serious child health problems 
throughout mozambique 
the project will be undertaken in four districts of central 
zambezia province and will also involve three nongovernmental 
organizations that already have programs there doctors without

a couple convicted of killing a diabetic 
daughter by withholding medical aid on religious grounds were placed 
on probation friday and ordered to get a doctor for their other 
children 
william and christine hermanson were convicted in april of 
thirddegree murder and felony child abuse in the 1986 death of 
their daughter amy 7 from untreated juvenile diabetes 
circuit judge stephen dakan gave them fouryear suspended 
sentences and placed them on 15 years probation with the stipulation 
that they take their other two children sons ages 1 and 11 to 
physicians for regular checkups and have them treated medically when 
necessary 
the couple could have been sentenced to up to seven years in 
prison 
hermanson a 42yearold former banker and his 38yearold wife 
a music school operator said they will appeal the conviction and 
sentence 
christian science doctrine relies on prayer and spiritual 
practitioners instead of doctors to treat illness but does not 
impose sanctions on followers who seek medical aid amy died three 
years ago after her parents depended on prayer and spiritual 
healing instead of traditional medicine 
we loved amy very much and still do hermanson said in court 
even those who condemned us loved amy 
his wife tearfully told the judge im just having a very 
difficult time understanding a justice system that has let us go 
this far and brought us to the point where were standing in front 
of you with a conviction when our family and our children are the 
absolute center of our activities 
the hermansons originally turned down a state offer of 15 years 
probation for a guilty or nocontest plea to child abuse the murder 
charge would have been dropped they refused saying they wanted a 
chance to defend their actions 
the defense argued the couple were protected by a state law that 
says parents who withhold medical care in the legitimate practice of 
their religion cant be considered abusive the jury disagreed 
according to trial testimony a christian science nurse at amys 
bedside finally summoned an ambulance but it was too late to save 
the child 
before sentencing defense attorneys filed a memorandum with the 
court in support of probation 
the defendants acted without any intent to do harm but were 
merely following what they thought was a lawful and effective method 
of treating their child the memo stated 
the us supreme court has refused to hear two appeals within the 
last year from parents whose children died after medical treatment 
was withheld for religious reasons

the agriculture department says at least one 
out of every three chickens headed for consumer tables is 
contaminated by salmonella bacteria tiny organisms that can cause 
food poisoning 
as every competent hunter knows to treat every gun as if it is 
loaded so consumers should be wary about chickens being carriers of 
salmonella 
some consumer advocates say the contamination rate is much higher 
than the levels acknowledged by usda those critics say one in two 
birds is fouled by salmonella and that in some particularly dirty 
plants nine out of 10 are tainted 
theres no way for the shopper to tell by looking at labels or 
the overall appearance of chickens as they are presented at food 
counters and dont bet on kosher chickens being safer 
usda experts say there is no valid scientific information 
showing that kosher chickens carry more or fewer salmonella bacteria 
than other poultry 
rod leonard of the private nonprofit community nutrition 
institute based in washington says usdas inspection procedures have 
become so bad that people shouldnt eat chicken but if you do he 
says handle them with care 
the departments food safety and inspection service rejects 
leonards advice about avoiding chicken and says american consumers 
have the best food supply in the world 
but the fsis goes along wholeheartedly with leonards second bit 
of advice to handle poultry with care red meat too for that 
matter 
one of the problems is that in many plants chickens free of 
salmonella are mixed in with some that are infected fecal matter 
spread through the slaughter and evisceration process is the 
carrier 
so when mixed batches of chickens are washed together there is 
a good chance of all being contaminated by salmonella bacteria 
tests by fsis show that on a national scale 35 percent to 37 percent 
of the nations broilers are contaminated a level the agency says 
has been fairly constant for almost 20 years 
at least 40000 salmonella infections are reported each year but 
experts believe that between 400000 and 4 million people annually 
contract salmonella food poisoning cases can range from extremely 
mild to severe 
most infected people get diarrhea and many have upset stomachs 
chills fever or headache the disease usually runs its course in 
three to five days and many believe they have the flu and never see 
a doctor 
salmonella infections can be lifethreatening for the very young 
the very old and for people who already have been weakened by other 
diseases it is believed that about 500 people a year die from 
salmonella poisoning 
the fsis says it is economically impossible to produce raw 
poultry and red meat free of salmonella here are some tips by the 
agency 
wash hands frequently with soap and water before and after food 
preparation 
never let raw meat and poultry or their juices come in contact 
with cooked meat or other food raw or cooked 
if a dishcloth is used for cleaning kitchen surfaces switch to 
a clean one after working with raw meat or poultry otherwise use 
paper towels 
cut raw meat or poultry on an acrylic cutting board that is 
thoroughly cleaned after each use that favorite wooden board should 
be used only for cutting bread and vegetables 
salmonella bacteria do not survive when beef or pork is cooked 
to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees fahrenheit or 
when poultry is cooked to 185 degrees so cook thoroughly

hanae mori kicked off her 35th anniversary 
exhibition friday with a parade of mostloved creations celebrating 
her sense of beauty and elegance 
the show previewing an exhibition of the works of asias only 
designer of haute couture was held in the hanae mori building in 
tokyos swank omotesando district 
many of her 85 favorite creations ranging from her colorful 
japanese happi suits of 1981 to her 1989 wave and butterfly 
dress in silk carried her colorful trademark 
the show included only one outfit from the 1960s a butterfly 
dress from her 1968 new york collection presented three years after 
the japanese designer brought her pretacouture line to the 
united states 
she has continued to create the soft and flowing chiffons and 
silky butterflyflower prints that won favor with american 
customers while exploring a wide range of silhouettes and fabrics 
in paris 
the show and exhibition which opens july 4 are a rare 
retrospective for mrs mori who said in a recent speech here that 
she thought it was about time i looked back at my own footsteps 
ive been doing some philosophical soulsearching about what 
fashion is she said apparel wraps the human drama as it 
develops 
that drama she said is the mystery and allure of how men and 
women interact 
as i look back i have come to feel that people especially 
women have changed a great deal she said 
mrs moris marriage of eastern fabrics and tradition with their 
suggestion of hidden beauty and the western couturieres sense of 
striking individual beauty however seem timeless 
unlike avantgarde japanese designers issey miyake and yohji 
yamamoto mori dresses always are classically feminine 
mrs moris fabrics always have been sumptuous silks rich wools 
and glittering sequins regal brocades recall more courtly eras 
three ballerinas danced through the runway wearing short tafetta 
and chiffon ball gowns of 1986 a slinky rose ensemble from 1977 
and flirty daisy dresses from 1988 all shapely and romantic 
not shocking 
mrs moris elegant designs are worn by the wives of japanese 
prime ministers and even empress michiko 
the 1970s an era that wasnt for making women beautiful 
didnt appeal much to mrs mori women were not at their best in 
terms of beauty she said 
the 1980s suit her better nowadays health and nature is 
beautiful she said after all im japanese i like things 
fragile and effervescent 
despite her restrospective mrs mori says looking forward comes 
more naturally to her 
i rarely look at the past she said the nature of my work 
is to anticipate how people will live in the world to come and stay 
a step ahead 
sometimes i want to make something but its too early so i 
put it back in my treasure chest and wait for the right time

mayor jacques chirac has rejected plans for an 
antiaircraft battery to protect visiting leaders during 
bicentennial celebrations although the city of light will be 
sprouting submachine guns and missiles 
the display of firepower is piquing the people celebrating 200 
years of liberty equality and fraternity 
critics say the security dragnet to be enforced during a 
meeting of the worlds seven richest countries at the same time 
might be better suited for kings 
the bicentennial of the rich said the communist party 
newspaper lhumanite in a headline this week 
the elaborate arrangements all but ignore 30 other heads of state 
from latin america africa and asia so a group including french pop 
singer renaud is organizing a countersummit of the poor on july 
8 
any resemblance between the commemoration of the bicentennial 
of the french revolution and a great popular celebration is becoming 
more remote each day the conservative tabloid le quotidien de 
paris said this week following the disclosure of a plan to install 
doublebarreled 20mm guns on a bridge over the seine 
two centuries ago the paris mob freed the last prisoners from 
the bastille on july 14 the descendants of this same crowd will be 
under lock and key the newspaper said 
chirac urged the defense ministry to find someplace else for the 
antiaircraft battery mirage jetfighters and crotale missiles still 
will back up more than 30000 policemen and soldiers on patrol from 
july 1217 according to air force spokesman col serge lenne 
under the security plan parts of central paris will be closed to 
most vehicles the louvre museum is to be closed for three days and 
tourist boats forbidden to ply the seine 
six radar systems will be added to the four permanently installed 
around paris infrared cameras for night viewing will be mounted on 
high altitude sites and a dirigible will float in the city sky 
we all know that power makes you mad opposition politician 
jacques toubon said in a jab at socialist president francois 
mitterrand toubon is mayor of the 13th district where the tolbiac 
bridge is located 
gen yves auberts plan to turn the tolbiac bridge into a 
military zone for a week beginning july 10 was aimed at deterring 
any hostile planes penetrating the city via the seine lenne said 
the air force is currently looking for another site lenne 
said adding it would likely be inside paris 
the security arrangements have produced tongueincheek jibes 
maybe im not a chief of state of one of the richest countries 
in the world wrote le monde satirist claude sarraute but im 
the head of a developing family and i was fearing for my security 
with all the fighting in subway stations and deadly words received 
in the middle of a traffic jam

defense minister pierre chevenement to take measures dignified of

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home fell in may to its lowest level in 
three years primarily because of increases in mortgage rates the 
national association of realtors reported friday 
the real estate trade group said its affordability index was at 
1001 last month down from 1032 in april and the lowest since may 
1986 when it measured 998 
mays index level meant that a family earning the median income 
of 32644 annually had 01 percent more income than needed to 
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of 
a medianpriced home 
the median price for an existing home in may was 93100 meaning 
half the homes sold for more and half for less mays median price 
was up 200 from aprils 92900 
the mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 1046 
percent from 1008 percent in april the rate represents a composite 
of fixed and adjustable rates 
the realtors group predicts better housing affordability 
conditions as adjustable rates follow the fixed rates downward 
trend 
overall it looks as though the typical buyer has passed the 
low point in housing affordability for the year said nar

actor don johnson denied accusations that 
someone at his wedding to actress melanie griffith opened fire with 
a shotgun on a helicopter carrying a tabloid reporter and 
photographer 
the thought that any member of dons party would attempt to 
bring down a chopper over the vicinity of his own guests is 
ridiculous johnson spokesman elliot mintz said thursday 
the star reporter barry levine said the craft came under fire as 
it circled a ranch eight miles west of aspen colo during mondays 
private ceremony 
local and federal authorities said the helicopter was hit by what 
appeared to be buckshot usually fired by skeet shooters 
mintz acknowledged that some guests were shooting skeet before 
the wedding but he said the control tower at aspen airport was 
alerted to that 
levine 30 and photographer ross truiak 44 were slightly 
wounded apparently by buckshot said tom stephenson sheriffs 
deputy in pitkin county colo a number of shotgun pellets have 
been found within the cockpit of the helicopter 
and pitkin county sheriff bob braudis said thursday that 
investigators doubt there was a serious attempt to shoot down the 
helicopter he said there is little chance the person firing the 
shots ever will be identified

in warsaws streets hurling stones and molotov cocktails at police 
who responded with water cannons 
i know well that public opinion associates me more often with 
martial law and less often with the line of reforms with those so 
significant decisions of the 10th plenum i must take into 
consideration social reality jaruzelski said 
during the 10th plenum in january communist officials agreed in 
principle to restore legal status to solidarity which had been 
outlawed after the 1981 martial law crackdown 
jaruzelski said in an interview with the associated press on 
wednesday that he might not accept the presidency without support of 
the solidarityled opposition 
solidaritybacked lawmakers in the national assembly which will 
meet next week to elect a president said they would vote against 
jaruzelski 
earlier as the 230member central committee convened a 
spokesman at the partys press office who asked not to be identified 
said there was hearsay that kiszczak would be nominated but he 
added it is unofficial 
kiszczak a jaruzelski loyalist is a 63yearold army general 
who heads polands police apparatus and helped wage the governments 
war against solidarity for most of the 1980s 
despite that he won the confidence of the solidarity leadership 
during negotiations that began last august during a national wave of 
strikes 
like jaruzelski he threatened to step down during the january 
plenum unless solidaritys legal status was reinstated 
he also led officials in negotiations with the opposition which 
ended in april with solidarity being legalized thetalks also 
cleared the way for elections earlier this month the countrys 
freest since world war ii 
in his statement jaruzelski described kiszczak as the soldier 
politician patriot and a man who has been close to me for many 
years 
in the eyes of the society including also opposition circles 
he is rightly considered as a leading representative of the line of 
reconciliation 
jaruzelskis name had been linked to the presidency since the 
office was created as a result of the april agreement but he 
himself stressed wednesday the need for someone who could have at 
least a minimum of support from both sides 
the president is to be the guarantor of the state responsible 
for the armed forces and for polands foreign alliances the 
president who may serve two sixyear terms may also dissolve 
parliament in limited circumstances and declare one 90day state of 
emergency 
on thursday solidarity leader lech walesa said there are more 
candidates for president than we think and there are many 
candidates on which both sides will agree 
solidarity deputies and senators are to meet in warsaw on 
saturday to debate the unions stance on the presidency solidarity 
is not expected to put up its own candidate 
candidates backed by the labor union won 99 of 100 seats in the 
newly created senate and all 161 seats open to the opposition in the 
460member sejm during voting in june the remaining sejm seats were 
reserved for the communists and their allies who control the 
legislature 
in the interview wednesday jaruzelski said he is open to more 
democratic reforms as long as they benefit society 
he also said the communist party will not return to its monopoly 
rule of the past 
we have become convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy 
thing not only in the economy but also in political life he 
said 
wearing his familiar dark glasses and a traditional business 
suit jaruzelski declared that his partys automatic leading role in 
poland already is history 
asked how far democratization could go he said in a written 
answer the limits of the reforms are not rigid the main issue is 
their social purpose and effectiveness 
he said the economic and social changes have already put poland 
in the forefront of reforms in the east bloc 
asked about the whether he would be a presidential candidate 
jaruzelski said that would depend on democratic consultations 
within the party and added i will also seriously consider the 
stand of the opposition understanding that the president 
especially in our conditions when we have to unite the nations 
efforts and build platforms of accord should have at least a 
minimum of support from all sides 
i am a soldier so i have a deeprooted feeling of duty but 
also of honor i will not crawl to this post 
jaruzelski said the communists fared poorly in the june 4 and 
june 18 elections because voters have not yet realized how much the 
party platform has changed in favor of democracy

officers led by a paratroop corps 
brigadier ousted the civilian government of prime minister sadek 
mahdi in a bloodless coup friday and assumed dictatorial powers 
the officers leading the coup sudans fourth in 33 years 
suspended the constitution declared a state of emergency and banned 
independent newspapers according to egypts middle east news agency 
they warned they may punish violent opposition to the coup with 
death but promised nonpartisan nonracist government in the 
nation divided by a southern war between dominant moslem northerners 
of arab descent and a black nubian minority of christians and 
animists 
the war has cost the government a ruinous 1 million a day while 
it ran up a foreign debt of 13 billion soaring inflation and 
widespread consumer shortages caused food riots in khartoum earlier 
this year 
the new rulers took power shortly after midnight the news agency 
said and declared themselves a national salvation revolution 
council under the chairmanship of brig omar hassan ahmed bashir he 
is the thirdranking officer in the paratroop corps 
bashir announced the coup on official radio omdurman and named 
himself prime minister defense minister and armed forces commander 
he imposed an indefinite nighttime curfew on the dusty capital of 
africas largest country onethird the size of the continental 
united states 
khartoums airport and sudans airspace were closed soldiers 
barricaded the bridges over the blue nile and white nile isolating 
the three sections of the capital 
there were conflicting reports about mahdis status one said he 
escaped arrest another said he was seen being driven from his home 
by soldiers 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the us 
embassy in khartoum confirmed the coup 
the military reportedly has arrested a number of cabinet 
members said ms tutwiler 
we regret the military is taking action to overthrow sudans 
democratically elected government and we urge an early return to 
democracy she said it is critical that whoever is in control 
takes immediate steps to find a peaceful solution to the war and to 
improve the provision of humanitarian relations 
bashir is a veteran of the sixyear southern war and cited 
mahdis failure to end the conflict as a key reason for his 
overthrow 
but the coups effect on a current peace initiative is unknown 
in addis ababa ethiopia where a new round of peace talks was to 
start tuesday spokesman edward lino of the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army said it is premature to discuss the situation he 
said the rebels have not heard from khartoum about tuesdays talks 
for months the military has been restive about mahdis 
reluctance to negotiate with the rebels 
last year the army command reminded mahdi that soldiers were 
dying while the government vacillated army officers threatened to 
move against him if mahdi continued to delay the united states and 
other countries threatened to withhold aid for the same reason 
mahdi finally gave in and peace talks began in may 
sudans new rulers do not appear allied with army commanders who 
forced mahdi to capitulate 
the coup leaders have designated the general command and army 
leaders as the former command the egyptian agency said 
indicating the paratroop and armored units that ousted mahdi were 
not from the top echelons of sudans military command 
it is the fourth coup since sudan proclaimed independence from an 
egyptianbritish consortium on jan 1 1956 the military has ruled 
for 23 of the past 33 years 
gili farah a sudan news agency journalist said there were no 
reports of violence during or after the coup 
bashir said his takeover was neither partisan nor sectarian 
appearing to disavow any connection with the fundamentalist national 
islamic front sudans secondbiggest party after mahdis and 
dictator gaafar nimeiri who last week said he would regain power 
soon 
the national salvation revolution is a genuine sudanese 
revolution the revolution of a people who rose up against tyranny 
corruption partisanship and sectarianism bashirs statement said 
its a national revolution neither leftist nor rightist not 
partisan not mayist not racist 
mayist refers to followers of nimeiri who seized power in a 
may 25 1969 coup and called his 16year rule the may 
revolution 
nimeiri was overthrown in april 1985 by a military council that 
ruled for a year then surrendered power in april 1986 to mahdi 
whose umma party won a parliamentary majority in militaryorganized 
elections 
part of the oxfordeducated mahdis problem was that he is a 
greatgrandson of the mahdi whose fervent moslem followers defeated 
a british colonial force and brought brief independence to sudan in 
the late 1800s the mantle of religious leadership caused him to 
avoid decisions that may have been interpreted as antimoslem 
one southern demand was the removal of harsh islamic laws 
introduced by nimeiri and suspended by mahdi earlier this year 
southern sudanese want more autonomy and development in their 
region which is plagued by warinduced famine

try explaining to the postal service and the 
telephone company that while you have a new address you still live 
in the same house 
thats what lowry air force base residents faced when officials 
began changing street names eight weeks ago to make military 
addresses conform to the surrounding area 
base residents simply had to send changeofaddress cards 
supplied by the post office 
then they began receiving hefty installation charges for phones 
and cable television subscriptions that had been in place for years 
i can understand how that would happen said debbie thomas u 
s west phone company spokeswoman about 999 percent of the time 
when you have an address change on an account the computers assume 
thats a location change 
for some the trouble didnt stop there neither did the postal 
carrier 
we need a good solid address in order to deliver mail said 
postal service spokesman scott budny in this case there were so 
many different ways of addressing the mail that the people who lived 
at the address didnt know how to address their own mail 
to make matters worse some of the new street names duplicated 
names of streets in suburban northglenn budny said our clerks 
werent used to a street named rampart being on lowry air force 
base 
about 2 percent of the mail to those families was marked return 
to sender before problems were resolved

soviet nuclear submarines are poorly built and the 
navy is covering up the problems a veteran officer said in an 
attack published friday after two recent sub accidents 
capt ilya b kolton who served aboard soviet submarines for 30 
years blames the navy leadership and defense construction industry 
for carelessness and shoddy work that has cost sailors lives 
construction deficiencies plus imperfect crew rescue 
equipment plus the startling slowness and inertia of the naval 
agencies in introducing new ideas such in my opinion is the 
alarming formula of the recent emergencies and tragedies said 
kolton an atomic energy researcher who serves in the naval reserve 
his criticism of the worlds largest submarine fleet was 
published in the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda whose readers 
include many young sailors and other members of the armed forces 
although official commissions are still investigating kolton 
said the problems he cited were clearly behind the april 7 fire and 
sinking of the experimental nucleararmed and powered submarine 
komsomolets and mondays accident aboard another nucleararmed and 
powered submarine 
fortytwo sailors died in the komsomolets accident off norway in 
mondays accident also off norway a pipe burst in the cooling 
system of a reactor aboard an echo iiclass sub no one was hurt 
and the soviets have said no radiation was leaked to the environment 
in either accident 
the military newspaper red star on friday questioned whether the 
echo iiclass sub built in the 1960s should still be in use it 
quoted capt y magakov acting head of the northern fleets 
technical department as saying the navy was considering whether to 
keep using subs of the same design as the one involved in mondays 
accident 
in an introduction to koltons article komsomolskaya pravda 
noted the warships involved in the recent accidents had not been 
shot at and added in a biting remark the navy poses a threat in 
the first place to ourselves 
kolton recounted several accidents or near accidents he said he 
had survived aboard soviet nuclear subs including one aboard the 
countrys first nuclearpowered submarine the leninsky komsomol in 
1962 
poorly constructed valves designed to shut off the flow of steam 
from generators in the eactor system malfunctioned allowing steam 
to flow into the crews living quarters kolton says a disaster was 
averted but doesnt say how 
western reference books say the ship suffered a reactor meltdown 
in the 1960s but it was unclear whether this was the same accident 
kolton described 
premier nikita s khrushchev later gave kolton and the rest of 
the crew a top award this was the pay for serious construction 
deficiencies threatening the ship and crew wrote kolton 
criticism of the ship has also come from us experts the late 
chief of the us navys nuclear program adm hyman rickover said 
after touring the leninsky komsomol in 1959 that its construction 
was a sloppy job 
one western reference book modern soviet weapons says 
soviet naval ships suffer frequent breakdowns and that sailors are 
poorly trained 
in another incident for which kolton did not give a date four 
soviet sailors died in a poorly designed test of a submarine rescue 
chamber 
he said naval problems are frequently covered up 
experience shows that when a disaster occurs in the fleet 
commissions protecting the high leadership hide the main guilty 
people and with them also the basic reasons for the disasters 
kolton said

indians and descendants of settlers of the 
northern plains are joining together for a fourday prairie 
extravaganza celebrating north dakotas 100th birthday 
an encampment demonstrating the indian way of life 100 years ago 
is sharing space with an estimated 3000 cowboys in a 300unit wagon 
train at the festivities that officially begin saturday indian 
dancers will be on the same program with those depicting lt col 
george armstrong custers 7th cavalry 
the exhibits are aimed at showing the good things about each 
culture without dredging up the battles of the past organizers say 
jill nodland assistant director of the state indian affairs 
commission said the 22000 indians in the state have mixed feelings 
about participating in the centennial party 
some feel we are all in this together and we have to learn to 
live together while others believe the indian reservations are 
not part of the state she said 
god i hope not terry bernhardt the coordinator of the 
indian and wagontrain encampment said when asked whether human 
rights issues associated with the settlement of the plains will be 
explored during the gathering 
i guess we want to accent the positive it is a positive 
celebration and we want to keep it with the positive stuff he 
said it is more like when the white settlers first got here the 
indians got along well that is what we are recreating now 
up to 300 indians furtrappers and buckskinners from four states 
have demonstrations and exhibits planned during the centennial 
celebration which has been dubbed the party of the century by 
the state centennial commission 
bernhardt calls the encampment a onceinalifetime chance to see 
what life was like for the pioneers 
the indians are coming from all over the us we have every 
tribe that i can think of represented he said 
standing rock sioux tribal president charles murphy said some 
indians on his reservation are all charged up about the 
centennial bash while others are heading to other cities during the 
long fourth of july weekend 
patrick brown a spokesman for the state centennial commission 
said planners visited north dakotas four reservations two years ago 
to ask the tribes how best to involve them in the centennial 
as a result of those meetings an indian centennial logo was 
created a native american day was celebrated in april and a 
curriculum on indians was written for schools brown said 
you cant really have a festival celebrating the people who 
live on the prairie without involving native americans he said 
minor friction existed between settlers and indians in 1889 when 
north dakota became a state but there was no open conflict said jim 
davis a historian for the state historical society 
the reservations established in 1867 were well entrenched by 
statehood he said 
hostilities in north dakota were pretty much over right after 
the custer massacre there were few incidents after 1876 davis 
said there were still some hard feelings and stuff like that the 
military presence was still on some of the reservations custer 
and more than 200 of his men were killed in battle at little big 
horn in 1876 
for the centennial party both cultures will demonstrate how they 
sold and traded goods decades ago how they made their clothes and 
household goods and some of the ceremonial dances 
organizers of the event four years in the planning expect that 
the population of bismarck and neighboring mandan together about 
65000 people could swell by 100000 over the four days

with a light wind at their backs and sunny skies 
above four french students embarked friday on an unusual class 
project a windsurfing voyage across the atlantic 
the students plan to surf in fourhour shifts during the 
monthlong trip a catamaran sailing alongside with a support crew 
of five classmates 
weve been dreaming of leaving new york city from the bay 
said arnaud crussol 21 before departing from south street seaport 
its a sunny day theres a wind a good direction wind so 
everything is ok 
minutes later he was standing up on the board working the 
orangeandblue sail to catch a fresh breeze that sent him skimming 
down the east river toward the harbor 
crussol dropped the sail as a tugboat and barge steamed past 
briefly rocking the board and catamaran then it was on toward the 
statue of liberty the narrows and the open seas of the north 
atlantic 
destination la rochelle france 
we are not very wellknown windsurfers but we are good 
windsurfers said amaury de la bouillerie at 19 the youngest of 
the group from the institut superieur du commerce in paris 
we are very excited we have been preparing for a year said 
beatrice comby 22 the lone female windsurfer 
their school encourages students to take a year to work on a 
project unrelated to their studies the business students spent the 
time lining up sponsors training and learning the ropes on the 
40foot fiberglass catamaran equipped with sophisticated radio 
equipment and a fax machine for weather reports 
its just for fun that we do this de la bouillerie said 
we were friends and we love windsurfing and we wanted to do 
something very special and so thanks to our school we could work 
for one year doing that looking for sponsors 
the atlantic has been crossed by windsurfers twice before the 
first time in 1982 by stephan peyron of france in a large boatlike 
vessel 
the students will be using a conventional board its a normal 
windsurf its a beach toy in fact crussol said 
one difficulty the windsurfer will usually travel faster than 
the catamaran so the windsurf will have to slow down crussol 
said 
the biggest problem having no winds de la bouillerie said 
its the one thing we are worried about that and storms which 
become more likely as the summer weeks go by 
on the distant shore wait their countrymen and worried parents 
they are a little bit afraid but they know we are prepared 
miss comby said so there is no big problem

the internal revenue service proposed on friday 
several changes designed to improve 1989 individual income tax forms 
and announced new forms for reporting childrens investment income 
and additional capital gains 
it is the third year the irs has released the new forms and asked 
the public to comment and offer suggestions 
one new form numbered 8814 would allow parents to report on 
their own tax return the investment income of dependent children

1000 were required to file their own returns and were taxed at 
their parents rate

losses 
the proposed changes in existing forms include 
the name and address area on forms 1040 and 1040a was redesigned

once again sadek mahdi has lost power as 
the democratically designated prime minister of sudan one of 
africas poorest nations 
the first time more than two decades ago mahdi was victim to 
the parliamentary system on friday it was the military who brought 
him down in an apparently bloodless coup by officers who said his 
dillydallying has ruined the country 
oxfordeducated mahdi 53 encouraged a free press and lively 
parliamentary debates during his three years in power but his 
aloof reticent style of governing could not come to grips with 
civil war flood devastation a battered economy and rampant 
starvation 
his first experience with the premiership was brief mahdi gained 
power as prime minister in july 1966 at age 30 becoming sudans 
youngest leader interparty squabbles brought down his coalition 
less than 10 months later 
general governing chaos continued giving gen gaafar nimeiri the 
opportunity to stage a coup on may 25 1969 and end the experiment 
in democracy 
when the army overthrew nimeiri 16 years later few believed 
promises that control would be surrendered to civilians in a year 
but true to their word the generals oversaw fair elections in 
april 1986 mahdi won and he got his second chance 
his election followed a family pattern of sudanese leadership 
begun by his greatgrandfather mohamed ahmed abdullah sudans 
national hero who organized an uprising that in 1885 overthrew 
british rule that selfrule ended with a british takeover 12 years 
later 
in 1881 abdullah declared himself the mahdi a messianic figure 
that some moslems believe god will send as successor to the prophet 
mohammed 
sadek mahdis grandfather abdelrahman mahdi in 1945 founded 
the umma party establishing a power base of the 3 million to 5 
million sudanese who believe abdullah was the mahdi 
sadek mahdi succeeded his father siddiq as umma chief in 1961 
five years after independence his aspirations to lead the mahdists 
ansar sect led to a split in 1971 and the ousted ruler and an uncle 
remain at odds 
contending with his islamic heritage are mahdis years at oxford 
where in 1957 he took a degree in philosophy and political science 
he became as fluent in english as in his native arabic and also an 
adept tennis player 
yet mahdi has two wives approved in islam and always appears in 
public in sudans traditional flowing white robes and turban 
in the months before the coup mahdi had to compromise his 
religious background by suspending islamic laws introduced by 
nimeiri a condition for opening talks with the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army 
mahdi finally gave in early this year when the army and 
professional and trade unions handed him an ultimatum 
afterward he formed a new broadbased cabinet abrogated a 
defense pact with egypt sent officials to talk to the rebels in 
neighboring ethiopia and decided to hold a constitutional conference 
in september to settle the civil war

the federal communications commission gave 
american telephone amp telegraph co the goahead friday to offer 
customized longdistance service to large corporate and government 
customers 
the commission denying challenges by mci communications corp 
us sprint and others said atampts socalled tariff 12 had not been 
shown to be illegal or discriminatory 
the decision was seen as a major victory for atampt battling to 
retain a share of the important market for customdesigned networks 
that large companies use for internal communications 
the fcc orginally declared the plan illegal in an april 18 ruling 
because it was not equally available to all customers with similar 
needs but the commission suspended a twoyear investigation and 
allowed atampt to continue offering the plan while giving the company 
30 days to revise it 
atampt filed a revision in may in the midst of a slew of challenges 
by competitors who said the tariff was a disguise for predatory 
pricing atampt said in its revised offering that it wouldnt penalize 
companies that dropped the plan also adding some services and 
changing some rates 
gerald brock fcc common carrier bureau chief said friday that 
no compelling argument has been presented that the proposed tariff 
is so patently unlawful as to warrant rejection 
he also said there was no evidence that further investigation was 
warranted 
the controversy stems solely from competitors attempting to 
roll regulatory logs at atampt each time it wins what they have lost 
in fair open competition said atampt spokesman herb linnen 
us sprint spokeswoman janis langley said the fcc action was 
further evidence of the illegality and unlawfulness of the fcc 
order suspending the tariff 12 investigation and its also 
evidence of the fccs intention to rubber stamp all of the tariff 12 
filings 
kathleen keegan of mci said her company was disappointed with 
the fccs failure to recognize tariff 12 is a customerspecific 
vehicle for offering discriminatory rates on services that are 
generally available 
we believe that the court appeal will affirm our view she 
said 
fcc mci sprint and the independent data communications 
manufacturers association filed suit against the april ruling in the 
us court of appeals that action is pending 
tariff 12 first was used in 1985 to provide a service to the 
defense department and its 12 users include general electric ford 
motor co and ei dupont de nemours opponents said it was designed 
to disguise rate discounts and that atampt was illegally selling the 
service below cost

critics say strict new guidelines could stifle 
creativity at an art school where exhibits including the flag on the 
floor and the late mayor in womens clothes touched off protests 
but a state lawmaker who was arrested for picking up the 
exhibited flag praised the guidelines released thursday by the 
school of the art institute of chicago 
the school now can relocate or remove any exhibit that may 
be disruptive to the educational process or hazardous to the 
health and or safety of viewers or participants 
harvey grossman legal director of the american civil liberties 
union in illinois said that is particularly vague and could 
result in chilling and inhibiting student creativity and 
expression 
grossman said school officials should explain to students just 
what that standard means im sure they intend to do that 
the guidelines formulated by a committee of students teachers 
and administrators also give the school the authority to determine 
when if how long and where students art will be shown 
the art institute has been the site of protests within the past 
two years over two student exhibits one included an american flag 
placed on the floor where it could be walked on and the other a 
painting of former mayor harold washington in womens undergarments 
state sen walter w dudycz a republican who led protests 
against the flag exhibit praised the guidelines as an attempt to 
treat controversial student exhibits equally 
they had no policy whatsoever said dudycz the harold 
washington painting was forcibly removed in 24 hours and the school 
issued a public apology when i picked up the flag and folded it i 
was promptly arrested there was no apology and the exhibit 
continued 
marshall field v president of the board of trustees spelled out 
the new policy in a letter to board members 
a long debate in arriving at the guidelines shows the extreme 
difficulty of balancing personal freedom of expression in an 
educational environment with responsibilities to community 
concerns and public sensitivities field wrote 
a spokeswoman for the school christine oneill said much 
attention was focused on the school because of the flag exhibit and 
the new policy guidelines are in response to great public 
concern 
meanwhile in springfield lawmakers cut the schools request for 
state funds from 130000 for next year to 1 in retaliation for the 
flag exhibit but david fields spokesman for gov james r 
thompson suggested thursday that thompson might use his amendatory 
veto to eliminate the 1ayear restriction

communist party leaders friday 
rejected an appeal to free all political prisoners meet with human 
rights activists and reassess the 1968 sovietled invasion that 
crushed political reform 
in washington on friday a us official said the chief political 
officer at the us embassy in prague was ordered to leave the 
country for what communist authorities called excessive involvement 
with dissidents 
the us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
diplomat robert norman had been due to leave prague in about a month 
for transfer to another assignment the official said everything 
norman did was compatible with his duties there 
czechoslovak rights activists on thursday called on the prague 
leadership to allow peaceful demonstrations free all political 
prisoners and reassess the 1968 invasion 
the document was titled a few words an allusion to the 
2000 words manifesto of 1968 that is considered one reason the 
warsaw pact invaded 
a source in vienna said 1800 intellectuals actors artists and 
bluecollar workers had signed it 
the ruling party politburo lashed out at the attempt at a new 
provocative signature campaign of some illegal groups aimed at 
confrontation with the socialist state the socialist political 
system 
the politburo as reported by the state news agency ctk also 
charged illegal groups with the help of certain political circles 
in the west try to create tension in society with the aim to 
destabilize conditions in our country 
these are dangerous efforts which must be opposed with utmost 
resolution the statement added 
the communist party daily rude pravo denounced what it said was 
an appeal for confrontation with the socialist state 
containing demands for the recognition of charter 77 and its 
free destructive activity and for a return to unlimited private 
enterprise 
it is an appeal to sellout socialism they want to 
overthrow our social system rude pravo said 
the appeal was issued in the name of four rights campaigners 
including playwright vaclav havel according to the londonbased 
palach press newsletter and other sources 
it called for a free discussion to review not only the 
stalinist 1950s but also the prague spring the invasion of 
czechoslovakia by the five armies of the warsaw pact and the 
process of normalization that followed 
the czechoslovak leadership still suspicious of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms has so far refused to reexamine the 
1968 reforms the invasion that crushed them is officially still 
described as a necessary action to defend socialism 
the appeal called for religious freedom and an end to political 
manipulation and censorship 
rude pravo indicated the signatories of the appeal might be 
disciplined for their initiative but it did not elaborate 
patience has its limits there is a very instructive saying 
those who sow wind will reap storm it is time for everyone who 
wants to play with the fire to realize this the newspaper said 
rude pravo also quoted politburo member miroslav stepan as 
telling a meeting thursday that the authors of the appeal do not 
hide their counterrevolutionary intentions

news reports friday said party elders want prime 
minister sousuke uno to resign after less than a month in office 
because a sex scandal has tarnished the clean image for which he was 
chosen 
uno the foreign minister was selected largely because he had 
not been touched by the recruit influencebuying scandal that drove 
prime minister noboru takeshita from office june 2 
the recruit affair reached the top echelons of business the 
bureaucracy and the liberal democratic party which has governed 
japan since 1955 uno promised political reforms but has been 
unable to carry them out because of allegations that he kept paid 
mistresses 
he has spent much of the week denying reports of his impending 
resignation the latest version on friday was that he would step 
down after elections in three weeks for half the seats in 
parliaments upper house 
no one has said anything like that the newspaper asahi 
quoted uno as saying friday 
a dispatch by the kyodo news service said however that three 
party elders agreed at a meeting friday that he should resign for 
the benefit of the party and suggested finance minister tatsuo 
murayama as a temporary replacement 
it said the agreement was reached by former prime minister takeo 
fukuda a representative of former prime minister zenko suzuki and 
susumu nikaido another senior party member 
fukuda and suzuki had opposed the choice of uno because of his 
close ties to yasuhiro nakasone takeshitas predecessor nakasone 
is linked to the scandal in which the recruit co conglomerate is 
accused of trying to buy influence with political donations and 
cutprice stock shares 
other reports quoted the chief cabinet secretary masajuro 
shiokawa as saying unos resignation and general elections might 
come before long 
shiokawa believes unos resignation could solve many of the 
governments problems but that timing was important major 
newspapers reported 
reports that uno kept several paid mistresses have dashed hopes 
that he could repair the damage done to his party by the recruit 
affair 
the sex scandal also has become an international embarrassment 
for japan with the approach of an economic summit scheduled for 
july 14 in paris and has affected the stock and currency markets 
elections for the tokyo municipal assembly to be held sunday 
will be watched as a harbinger of the upper house contests july 23 
a poll published by the national daily mainichi indicated the 
liberal democrats would lose the tokyo election decisively 
it said the number of women saying they would leave the governing 
party to support the socialists had risen from 8 percent to 18 
percent and the number who would support the liberal democrats had 
declined from 33 to 18 percent 
kyodo said a womens organization in miyazaki western japan 
gathered more than 1000 signatures on a petition to uno saying 
it is an embarrassment for japan to be represented at the summit 
by a person who tramples over women

zaires president mobutu sese seko said friday 
there was no need for the united states and soviet union to continue 
arming rebels and the government in angola now that the warring 
sides have agreed to cease fire 
mobutu credited with successfully mediating between the two 
sides in angola also said mozambiques president joaquim chissano 
had asked him to convey a message to president bush presumably 
dealing with possible us mediation efforts between the government 
and rebels in that country 
mobutu said he had accepted a request by chissano last week that 
he mediate in mozambique the way he had in angola 
he declined to say what was in the message he delivered to bush 
thursday at the white house 
a senior american diplomat assistant secretary of state herman 
cohen will travel to mozambique in midjuly to discuss recent 
contacts between the leftleaning government and the south 
africanbacked renamo rebels cohen is also visiting south africa 
angola and zambia 
mobutu meeting with reporters at blair house across from the 
white house said cohen would discuss with angolan authorities the 
subject of establishing diplomatic ties with the united states but 
he refused to go into details 
things are moving along quite favorably he said adding that 
the question of usangolan ties had come up at the twohour 
meeting with bush 
conservative groups have opposed us diplomatic ties with 
angola including the creation of a small american office set up to 
monitor the pullout of cuban troops from angola under a 
ussponsored agreement signed last december 
mobutu who helped funnel us arms to the angolan rebels the 
union for the total independence of angola or unita said the 
government and rebels should now concentrate on economic 
rehabilitation of their country 
do unita and angola still need weapons he asked the sons 
and daughters of angola must now dedicate themselves to 
rehabilitation why must we have continues arms 
pressed on whether washington should cease arming unita mobutu 
said the united states is a sovereign government its up to them 
to decide 
the soviet union will probably decide to stop arming the angolan 
government in view of the ceasefire agreement in order not to 
uselessly poison the situation he said 
mobutu also said he had threatened to cut off ties with south 
africa if the government carried out the death sentences against 14 
blacks involved in the death of a policeman the executions have 
been stayed pending efforts by the 14 to appeal 
a senior administration official said this week that the united 
states would prefer that mobutu concentrate his mediation efforts in 
angola rather than in mozambique 
mobutu hosted a summit of african leaders at his palace in 
gbadolite last week at which angolan president jose dos santos and 
jonas savimbi leader of the unita rebels agreed to end their 
14year war and seek talks on powersharing 
mobutus diplomacy in arranging the peace meeting paved the way 
for a successful visit to washington in spite of allegations from 
members of congress and advocacy groups of human rights violations 
and corruption in his government

a vice president at the seabrook nuclear 
plant was fired after the facility was shut down following problems 
in the control room during a lowpower test 
george thomas a vice president in charge of nuclear production 
at the 6 billion reactor was fired thursday because of 
inappropriate management actions after the june 22 shutdown 
plant spokesman ron sher said friday 
it is premature to discuss just why he has been relieved 
sher said 
but sher said thomas was in the control room as an observer at 
the time of the shutdown and that the problem with thomas came 
after the shutdown not before 
sher said it was too early to speculate whether they would fire 
other employees 
the nuclear regulatory commission the state attorney general and 
the plant are investigating how control room personnel reacted when 
they learned of a valve malfunction that forced the shutdown after 
nine days of testing 
edward brown president of new hampshire yankee which operates 
the plant has acknowledged that control room operators did not 
follow proper procedures when the valve malfunctioned in the 
nonnuclear side of the plant 
nrc officials have said it took inspectors five minutes and 
discussions with at least three people to convince them to shut down 
the reactor 
seabrook officials since have said the lowpower tests 
successfully proved the design and operation of the plant and the 
tests will not be resumed even after the various reviews they hope 
for a commercial operating license later this year 
brown personally relieved thomas who then resigned from his 
position as a vice president with public service company of new 
hampshire the chief owner of the plant sher said 
thomas declined to comment on the firing or resignation 
thomas was the fourthhighest paid executive at public service as 
of dec 31 1988 with a salary of 127403 he reported to brown 
and was responsible for all phases of plant operation and support 
services sher said 
thomas who lives near the seabrook plant joined the yankee 
atomic electric co which supervised seabrook construction in 
1977 two years later he joined public service as nuclear 
production superintendent he was made a vice president in 1982

a 35000 grant to insure the programs sponsor the private 
nonprofit outsidein clinic and social service agency in addition 
the commission allocated 15000 to study the programs

program 67000 oliver said that will pay for medical malpractice 
and liability insurance and needles designed to break after a single 
use as required by the insurance company 
we see this as a comprehensive aids education program said 
oliver the needles are just a part well use that as a hook to 
try to get them into counseling because the ultimate aim is to get 
them to stop using drugs 
oliver said outsidein now is faced with finding money to 
continue the program beyond the oneyear pilot period 
oliver expects several hundred drug users to take advantage of 
the exchange program which is expected to begin in early august 
there are 7000 to 10000 intravenous drug abusers in multnomah 
county the state health division says 
statistics show the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 
spreading more rapidly among needlesharing drug abusers than any 
other segment of the population 
nationally about 20 percent of the 82764 aids cases reported 
between june 1981 and the end of 1988 have occurred among 
intravenous drug users in oregon intravenous drug abuse accounts

a jury ruled today against a highroller who 
claimed an atlantic city casino plied him with alcohol and 
painkillers forcing him to gamble until he lost 165000 
a federal jury deliberated for about three hours thursday and 
today before finding that shmuel aboud 44 of new york city must 
pay a 28000 gambling debt he amassed in 1985 at the golden nugget 
casinohotel 
aboud had contended he suffered from narcotic and alcohol 
intoxication and the casino took advantage of his condition 
the jury ruled that the golden nugget acted negligently but that 
the casinos action did not cause abouds gambling losses 
this tells the patron that they cant get drunk and blame 
someone else golden nugget attorney steven horn said after the 
verdict we think that this claim was totally frivolous a lie 
and the jury believed it 
abouds attorney steven goldman asked the judge to poll the 
jury he said he is considering filing an appeal 
he was sleeping at the table goldman said during closing 
arguments thursday in the lawsuit filed by aboud his head was 
rocking back and forth from nodding 
the civil case was being closely watched by the states casino 
industry and attorneys involved in the case say the outcome could be 
precedentsetting 
last week us district court judge mitchell h cohen ruled that 
casinos can be held liable for money lost by drunken gamblers today 
verdict meant that the jurors believed however that in abouds 
specific case the liability didnt exist 
the judge had ruled that casinos like tavern owners have a 
responsiblity to their customers prompting speculation that the 
decision could mean that casinos will stop serving free drinks 
it will affect the casino industry not greatly horn said 
this ruling by the judge could be overturned or define more 
clearly in a way that will make it difficult for the patron to 
prevail 
aboud an israeli citizen contends he lost 165000 during a 
gambling spree at the golden nugget in february and march 1985 after 
casino officials coaxed him to drink alcohol and take narcotic 
painkillers for his aching back 
this man lived a horror story for two weeks the big golden 
nugget and little sammy aboud goldman told the jury the guy 
was like a zombie 
the golden nugget filed a lawsuit in 1985 against aboud seeking 
payment of gambling debts totaling 28000 that aboud amassed at the 
casino 
the casino has since been sold it became ballys grand in 1987 
nobody put a gun to mr abouds head said stephen n dratch 
an attorney for the casino he is looking for someone to blme for 
his own foolishness 
aboud filed a counterclaim against the casino claiming he was 
deprived of his reason and understanding after casino officials 
offered him drinks while he gambled 
he had sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages but 
cohen refused to allow the jury to consider the punitive claims 
ruling that goldman failed to present evidence of the casinos 
wealth

the newspaper said the military base at keflavik about 30 miles 
west of reykjavik has been the center of controversy for the past 
month 
iceland officially protested a may 16 farewell speech by the 
outgoing commander of the us defense forces iceland rear adm 
eric mcvadon who called on icelanders who support the us presence 
to speak out the newspaper said 
mcvadon also implied that icelandic authorities were ungrateful 
to the us troops it said 
iceland is the only nato member without its own military and it 
relies on american forces for protection 
hermannsson said his country is a staunch supporter of the 
alliance and not antiamerican but he was critical of a weeklong 
us military exercise in iceland that ended wednesday stars and 
stripes reported 
it said he had us officers reduce the number of soldiers 
participating from 1300 to 950 
stars and stripes said controversy over the exercise began when 
the icelandic national radio wrongly reported the military exercise 
was to begin on june 17 the 45th anniversary of icelands 
independence from denmark the report sparked an 11hour debate in 
icelands parliament 
many feel that it was a mistake although we were fully aware 
of the fact that such an exercise would be undertaken it seemed to 
have escaped everybody that they would be so extensive the 
newspaper quoted hermannsson as saying 
when asked if he could see an end to the us presence in 
iceland the newspaper quoted him as saying i am certainly hoping 
that this will be so 
there are a number of people in iceland who would like to see 
the base disappear hermannsson said 
however stars and stripes quoting an unidentifed foreign 
ministry spokesman said independent surveys the past 10 years 
indicate most icelanders support the keflavik base and nato alliance

the bank of canada stopped issuing dollar bills 
friday in the latest step of a program to phase in the 11sided 
goldcolored loonie coin 
the royal canadian mint has 240 million of the new 1 coins 
already in circulation and believes that any reluctance among 
canadians to use them is fading spokesman michael francis said 
dollar bills remain legal currency indefinitely but their life 
expectancy under normal use is from nine to 12 months the 2 bill 
is now the smallest issued by the bank of canada 
francis in an interview from ottawa said banks and retailers 
might tire of handling both 1 coins and bills he predicted that 
the coin might become standard by the fall 
demand for the dollar coin has gone up steadily since 
january francis said 
he said the mint was distributing 1 million of the loonies 
weekly in january and the number rose gradually to 5 million weekly 
by may the mint distributed 98 million of the new coins one week 
in june he said 
it is nicknamed for its design of a loon the bird that makes its 
distinctive call in many northern canadian lakes 
the mint learned some lessons from the quick fade of a us 1 
coin before launching the coin the canadians found the us susan 
b anthony coin was too close in size to the quarter confusing 
consumers and the public relations campaign wasnt extensive enough 
before the coins launching in 1979 
the decision was made to have a special color and size for the 
loonie which was introduced in july 1987 after being considered for 
nine years 
the mint says the dollar coin was introduced to meet the needs of 
transit companies vending machine operators and retailers for a 
coin bigger than 25 cents the mint estimates it will save about 
147 million in two decades 
thats because dollar bills last only one year while a coin can 
stay in circulation for 20 years 
but canadians have complained that not enough vending machines 
have been converted to the loonie some men complain the coin wears 
out trouser pockets edward banning coin columnist for the globe 
and mail newspaper wrote last weekend that the coins are 
beginning to circulate a little more freely although many canadians 
still seem reluctant to use them and even some government agencies 
seem illprepared to keep the loonies off the endangered species

president bush expressing a strong belief that 
apartheid is wrong and that it must end said friday that the 
united states should provide funds for education housing and 
community programs for south africas blacks in a determined 
effort to end it 
after meeting with antiapartheid activist albertina sisulu bush 
issued a statement praising her saying she personifies the 
struggle for human rights and human dignity and her presence here is 
an inspiration to us all 
we believe strongly that apartheid is wrong and that it must 
end bush said he said the administration would work with 
congress to obtain funding for education housing and community 
programs for south africas blacks 
such programs should not be misunderstood as our acquiescing in 
apartheid but rather viewed as a determined effort to bring it to 
an end bushs statement said 
the presidents statement did not refer to mrs sisulus call for 
the united states to impose comprehensive economic sanctions against 
south africa 
mrs sisulu whose family has come to symbolize the struggle 
against south africas racial segregation policies said bush told 
her he was outraged by the apartheid system practiced by 5 million 
whites who rule 23 million blacks 
he hopes the us administration will be a catalyst for 
bringing about change in south africa she told reporters after 
the 20minute white house meeting 
bush at whose invitation mrs sisulu came to the united states 
met with her shortly before attending a ceremony to commemorate the 
25th anniversary of the civil rights act of 1964 
mrs sisulu the first south african actvist invited by a us 
president to washington said she had asked bush to impose 
comprehensive mandatory sanctions to force the government to 
negotiate with the black majority 
he said he had difficulty but he will see what to do with 
the question of tougher sanctions than those already imposed by the 
united states in 1986 she said asked whether bush had ruled out 
additional us measures she said no he didnt 
former president reagan was forced to impose limited economic 
sanctions against south africa after the democraticcontrolled 
congress overrode his veto 
liberal democrats have been pushing this year for tougher 
sanctions after failing to gain passage of such a measure last year 
the white house has said it opposes any congressional 
restrictions against south africa which would limit the 
administrations hands in dealing with the government there 
but bush has been more active than his predecessor in broadening 
contacts with both sides in order to advance negotiations between 
blacks and whites 
in addition to mrs sisulu he has met with other leading 
antiapartheid activists fw de klerk who is expected to become 
south africas president later this year has been invited to visit 
and will become the first south african leader to have official 
talks in washington in 30 years 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen will be in south africa 
next week 
mrs sisulus husband walter sisulu has been serving a life 
term since 1964 when he was arrested along with nelson mandela and 
other founders of the guerrilla arm of the outlawed african national 
congress 
two of her five children have fled south africa and she has been 
under house arrest and other restrictions for some 18 years

a week after security forces discovered 
two tunnels dug by a group of leftist prisoners inmates say they 
still are determined to escape from the high security prison 
we want freedom a group of prisoners shouted in unison from 
behind iron bars during a brief meeting with reporters thursday 
there is no justice in this country so we will dig a new 
tunnel we will do whatever possible to win our freedom said ali 
kemal bilginer a member of the leftist devyol organization 
some leftists have been jailed for nine years and are waiting for 
their trials to end 
justice ministry authorities took a group of journalists to the 
central anatolian city eskisehir for a brief tour of the prison 
where 326 leftist inmates are jailed the officials did not allow 
journalists to see all parts of the prison or talk freely with 
inmates 
security forces in the prison uncovered two underground tunnels 
40 yards and 45 yards long on may 22 
ugur ibrahimhakkioglu eskisehirs chief prosecutor said the 
prisoners melted the soil with urine and dug with handmade tools 
bilginer said they had dug for two months 
the prisoners painted masks and left them on their pillows at 
night fooling guards that they were sleeping while they dug 
ten leftist inmates from devyol and another leftist 
organization called kurtulus said they dug the tunnels 
we were arrested nine years ago and tried at military courts 
in a most despotic way we were not allowed to defend ourselves and 
some of our friends are still waiting for their trials to end 
said naim koc of kurtulus 
trials of 173 inmates still are continuing in upper courts 
a wave of terrorism that pitted leftists against rightists 
claimed 5000 lives in turkey prior to a military takeover in 1980 
about 30000 extreme leftist and rightist terrorist suspects were 
jailed following a martial law crackdown 
since then thousands have been released and dozens of trials 
have been concluded but some of the largest mass trials continue 
according to statistics compiled by turkeys independent human 
rights association 1542 terrorist suspects are in prison and still 
on trial and 1357 were convicted and are serving sentences 
since the tunnels were discovered prison authorities have 
emptied the first floor and moved inmates to the second floor 
inmates complained security forces raided the wards and took away 
their typewriters record players and radios in the past week 
koc said 45 prisoners started a hunger strike thursday to protest 
the restrictions and would continue their protest until their 
belongings are returned 
mehmet kok a spokesman for devyol said 40 other inmates will 
join the hunger strikers monday 
justice minister oltan sungurlu said the typewriters were taken 
away because they could be used for digging and the radios could be 
used to communicate with the outside

terrorists linked to a bombing that killed a 
us marine got part of a 600 million loan made to east germany 
with the help of an american bank according to former national 
security council staff member 
norman a bailey senior director of national security planning 
from 198183 said the money from the 1985 loan was dispersed to 
front companies and tax havens around the world 
it was then concentrated again in libya and was sent from libya 
to various accounts which were controlled by terrorist 
organizations and was then used by those terrorist organizations in 
their activities bailey said 
bailey made his allegations during the taping of follow the 
money a public broadcasting system program 
the official libyan news agency jana denied the story 
such claims are the latest inventions of the machine of 
misinformation and lies jana said 
the loan bailey said was traced through the national security 
agency a supersecret group at fort meade md that listens in on 
international communications 
lt gen william odom who directed that agency from 198588 
said on the pbs program that he couldnt comment directly 
i will say that such flows would not be abnormal for the east 
blocs way of supporting third world activities odom said 
white house spokesman roman papadiuk said he had no information 
to substantiate baileys statement 
tom lindeman a spokesman for the first national bank of chicago 
said a 600 million loan to east germany was organized in 1985 with 
the international bank of japan 
about 50 banks from different countries were involved he said 
alan delp the chicago banks senior vice president in charge of 
international banking said he would be very surprised if the money 
went to libya 
it would be very foolish on the part of the east germans he 
said 
helmut krausser a representative of the bank that received the 
money east germanys aussenhandelsbank foreign trade bank said 
on the pbs program that he didnt think libya had received that kind 
of support 
bailey said there was no question the loan could be traced 
we can identify a money trail which eventually ended up in 
the death of american marines in a discotheque in berlin and the 
death of libyans through american bombing of libya he said 
on april 5 1986 a bomb in a west berlin discotheque killed a 
us sergeant and a turkish woman and wounded 204 other people 
nine days later us planes bombed libya 
west german economist peter pietsch said it was not very probable 
that west german banks were involved 
it is certainly possible that east germany was engaged in this 
kind of activity he said but that is extremely hard to 
prove 
bailey who heads his own consulting firm said in an interview 
that he still has top secret clearance that allows him to see highly 
confidential papers 
white house spoksman bill harlow said it was not unusual for 
officials to keep their security clearance if they are consultants 
or contractors who need access to secret material after they left 
the government

a highroller bears responsibility for his 
losses at an atlantic city casino and was not forced to gamble under 
the influence of narcotics and alcohol a jury ruled friday 
the federal jury deliberated three hours over two days before 
finding shmuel aboud 44 of the new york city borough of queens 
must pay a 28000 gambling debt he ran up in 1985 at the golden 
nugget casinohotel 
the jury ruled that the golden nugget acted negligently but that 
the casinos action did not cause abouds gambling losses 
i think justice was done golden nugget attorney stephen 
dratch said it was his own actions that caused any alleged 
losses 
aboud had said the casino took advantage of his narcotic and 
alcohol intoxication 
this tells the patron that they cant get drunk and blame 
someone else said steven m horn another casino attorney 
abouds attorney steven goldman hailed the jurys finding that 
the casino acted negligently he had urged the jury to speak out 
against what he characterized as deceitful tactics by the casino 
industry i think its a moral victory goldman said 
goldman said he is considering an appeal 
aboud said he was disappointed 
i feel as its some big lie from the beginning to the end 
he said 
the civil case which lasted about two weeks was closely watched 
by the states casino industry casino officials said the outcome 
should lessen the impact of a potentially precedentsetting decision 
that said casinos can be held liable for money lost by drunk 
gamblers 
casinos like tavern owners have a responsiblity to their 
customers us district judge mitchell h cohen ruled prompting 
speculation that the decision could mean casinos will stop serving 
free drinks 
these cases are going to be extremely hard to prove both from 
a liability point of view and a damage point of view dratch said 
the odds are always in favor of the casino 
aboud an israeli citizen contends he lost 165000 during a 
gambling spree at the golden nugget in february and march 1985 after 
casino officials coaxed him to drink alcohol and take painkillers 
for his aching back 
in 1985 the golden nugget sued aboud seeking payment of 
gambling debts 
the casino has since been sold becoming ballys grand in 1987 
aboud filed a counterclaim saying he was deprived of his reason 
and understanding after casino officials offered him drinks while 
he gambled he also filed negligence claims against two physicians 
called by the casino who prescribed the painkillers 
the jury ruled that the physicians acted properly in prescribing 
the medication 
goldman charged on one occasion aboud gambled at a blackjack 
table with a bottle of percodan prescribed by the physicians 
sitting next to him 
casino employees laughing at aboud awakened him and said he had 
to gamble or he would have to go home goldman charged 
abouds gambling losses came during a 14day stay in a 
1000aday complimentary hotel room goldman said his client had 
recently won a 395000 insurance settlement in an car accident he 
said 
dratch said abouds total losses during the spree were only about 
2000 and that he took advantange of complimentary services 
totaling 16329 during his stay

they participatd in 40 demonstrations organized by the settler 
movement gush emunim or bloc of the faithful the army ordered that 
the hikers avoid isolated palestinian villages and be guarded by 
military patrols 
military spokesmen said there were no serious problems 
palestinian witnesses reported minor incidents of west bank 
residents throwing stones at jewish settlers in hebron and near 
bethlehem 
about 20 soldiers of the elite golani brigade landed by 
helicopter to stop a like number of men and boys from making an 
unescorted hike into battir a village near bethlehem 
this is a minority creating trouble said maj gen amram 
mitzna head of the armys central command he spoke to reporters 
after alighting from the helicopter about a mile from the village 
if we have to arrest them well arrest them he said we 
wont let them go anywhere 
the hikers members of americanborn rabbi meir kahanes militant 
kach party carried automatic rifles knives clubs and party flags 
with a fist set in the star of david they did not resist and headed 
back to jerusalem 
in other developments 
general strikes were held in the gaza strip and the west bank 
towns of ramallah and elbireh to protest israels deportation 
thursday of eight palestinians accused of helping lead the 
palestinian rebellion at least 538 palestinians and 23 israelis 
have been killed since the uprising known by the arabic word 
intefadeh began dec 8 1987 
israeli soldiers wounded 11 palestinians in the daily street 
battles that have become a staple of the uprising west bank 
hospital officials said a 14yearold girl suffered a serious 
gunshot wound in the head 
guards fired tear gas to stop riots in meggido prison in 
northern israel where about 2000 palestinians are held for 
security offenses an army spokesman said several soldiers and eight 
inmates suffered tear gas inhalation 
fridays demonstrations were advertised as hikes but some were 
entirely motorized they were organized after repeated complaints by 
settlers that the army was not doing enough to protect them

recently and two palestinians have been killed 
about 70000 jews live in enclaves among the 17 million 
palestinian residents of the west bank and gaza which israel 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
leftist politicians called fridays demonstrations a provocation 
to palestinians and a burden on the army 
brig gen ephraim sneh a former military governor of the west 
bank who is a legislator from the centerleft labor party said the 
hikes would increase tension 
in the context of the intefadeh these are not hikes these are 
political protests he said on israel radio when they increase 
friction with the arabs instead of reducing it they have the most 
negative value 
officials of gush emunim said the purpose was to assert jewish 
rights to go anywhere in the occupied lands which the settlers 
claim as part of biblical israel 
the bible grew up in this land said yehuda hazani a gush 
emunim organizer all these places are linked to the bible but we 
chose the places according to the landscape and nature 
in the battle of symbols that is part of the uprising settlers 
waved israeli flags as they drove to an ancient synagogue near 
hebron past palestinian flags hanging from utility wires israel 
has declared the palestinian flag illegal 
three helicopters circled overhead soldiers patrolled samua the 
village where the second century synagogue is located 
noam arnon spokesman for gush emunim pointed out damage to the 
synagogue and said there is terrorism both against people and 
against archeological sites 
a palestinian teacher who identified himself only as mohammed 
said residents resented the jewish intrusion on the moslem sabbath 
because today is our day for praying

theyre squandering money said paul sadler 65 who bicycled 
up shortly after the arc was turned on he said he believes priority 
should be given to improving housing and employment and drawing more 
industry to the area 
im sure there are a lot of people who feel the same way but 
they dont speak out they swallow it he said 
but frank sullivan spokesman for the metropolitan water 
reclamation district said if you accept that reasoning then 
there should be no public sponsored memorials or public works of art 
in the united states 
over the years the fountain and the arc will attract many 
times their cost in tourist business and add to the enjoyment of 
beauty by chicago residents just as the buckingham fountain has 
since the 1920s 
the water district lists among its achievements the digging of 
the 26mile long sanitary amp ship canal the largest engineering 
project of its kind before construction of the panama canal and the 
consequent reversal of the flow of the chicago river turning it 
away from lake michigan 
the canal helped pull the city out of a plague of epidemics of 
typhoid and cholera caused by waterborne diseases during the latter 
part of the 19th century 
since then the district has built locks sewagetreatment 
plants canals to handle water discharged from the plants the 
areas deep tunnel system to drain off excessive storm water from 
the city and from older suburbs and reservoirs to hold storm water 
from newer suburbs

hog farmers continue to hold back on expansion 
plans apparently waiting to see how markets develop and 1989 grain 
crops shape up a report by the agriculture department indicated 
friday 
as of june 1 the us inventory of hogs and pigs totaled an 
estimated 555 million head 1 percent below a year ago but 6 
percent more than two years ago the report said 
the breeding inventory was put at 733 million head down 3 
percent from a year earlier but 4 percent more than two years ago 
market hogs at 482 million head were down 1 percent from a year 
ago but were up 7 percent from two years ago 
officials said the pig crop during the first half of the current 
hog marketing year that began dec 1 was 465 million head down 1 
percent from the same period of 198788 but 7 percent more than two 
years ago 
in the 10 largest states which account for 79 percent of the 
us inventory farrowing intentions for june through november total 
466 million a 1 percent increase from a year ago and 2 percent 
more than two years ago 
according to the departments economic research service breeding 
and farrowing plans will closely reflect prospects for this years 
corn and soybean crops the outlook for those will take shape in 
august when usda provides comprehensive production estimates 
many hog producers have endured losses since last fall so 
their plans will be especially sensitive to feed costs the agency 
says in a new outlook report an unexpected belowaverage harvest 
this year likely would prompt largescale liquidation and sharp 
production cutbacks in 1990 
the following list shows the june 1 inventory in the 10 major 
states the first number in thousands is the total number of hogs 
in the state the second is the june 1 figures percentage of a year

chinas senior leader deng xiaoping on friday 
completed the purge of his onetime protege zhao ziyang who was 
disgraced after expressing sympathy for the studentled movement for 
democratic reforms 
zhao ousted as communist party chief last weekend was fired 
friday from his last government post vice chairman of the central 
military commission 
he was effectively stripped of power more than a month ago after 
he paid a tearful visit on may 19 to students on a hunger strike in 
tiananmen square he has not been seen in public since 
hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters flocked to 
the square the symbolic center of china until the military crushed 
the sevenweek prodemocracy movement by firing on unarmed civilians 
to drive protesters from the plaza on june 34 
tiananmen has been closed since but authorities planned to 
reopen it to tourists saturday to mark the 68th anniversary of the 
founding of the party according to the official newspaper the 
peoples daily 
since comrade zhao ziyang has committed serious mistakes i 
proposed his dismissal from the vicechairmanship of the central 
military commission deng said in a letter to the national 
peoples congress 
the staterun xinhua news agency said the legislatures standing 
committee carried out dengs wishes the congress has little power 
and mainly serves as a forum to publicize party policy 
president yang shangkun who spent his career in the military 
reportedly was seeking to replace zhao on the commission the 
commissions senior vice chairman is second only to deng in the 
military hierarchy 
yang has extensive contacts in the military and he was a strong 
supporter of the martial law premier li peng imposed on beijing on 
may 20 
zhao reportedly opposed the decree and the use of troops to quell 
the prodemocracy movement 
the communist party last weekend appointed jiang zemin a former 
shanghai mayor and party boss of chinas largest city to replace 
zhao as general secretary 
the partys central committee accused zhao of splitting the party 
and supporting counterrevolutionary turmoil 
deng has continued to call zhao comrade however indicating 
that zhao has been allowed to remain a party member 
the congress standing committee opened its session thursday by 
endorsing the governments crackdown as legal correct and 
necessary 
beijing mayor chen xitong told the committee on friday that more 
than 200 civilians including 36 college students were killed when 
thousands of soldiers backed by tanks made their way to tiananmen 
square 
dozens of soldiers also died in the violence xinhua quoted 
chen as saying 
the government previously has said that 200 to 300 people died 
half of them soldiers 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence reports say that up to 
3000 people most civilians were killed western diplomatic 
sources in beijing said this week that the death toll was in the 
thousands 
chen said 3000 civilians and 6000 soldiers and police were 
injured and more than 1000 army trucks 60 armored cars and 120 
buses were damaged or burned he put damages at 350 million xinhua 
said 
the government has arrested more than 1800 people as part of its 
crackdown and has announced 27 executions 
many speakers during the legislative session attacked hu jiwei a 
member of the standing committee and president of the chinese 
confederation of societies of journalism for leading a signature 
campaign against martial law radio beijing said 
the petition drive sought an extraordinary session of the 
standing committee to overturn martial law in what speakers called a 
serious political incident the radio said 
a widely publicized editorial that appeared friday in a party 
journal on theory joined the official media in defending the 
crackdown 
the recent event was by no means a patriotic movement to 
promote socialist democracy and freedom and to demand for punishment 
of official profiteering and elimination of corruption the 
journal seeking truth said 
it was a planned organized and premeditated political turmoil 
plotted by an extremely small number of people who made use of such 
slogans to agitate the students and people unaware of the truth 
said the editorial carried by xinhua

federal officials have dropped their 
investigation into a black teenagers claims that he was attacked 
by a gang of white youths who scratched ks into his back 
tracy eichelberger 17 accused federal investigators of bungling 
the case after officials announced thursday that it was being closed 
for lack of evidence 
the whole time the fbi has been trying to make me out to be the 
person who did something wrong he said it looks like they 
spent more time investigating the people i was associating with than 
the people who supposedly committed the crime 
eichelberger who graduates from louisville high school this 
summer claimed he was attacked oct 3 1987 at an abandoned car 
wash by several white youths who warned him not to socialize with 
white girls 
eichelberger who did not report the incident until 20 days after 
he said it occurred did not claim to have been beaten and 
apparently did not seek medical treatment 
during the 20month investigation fbi agents conducted more than 
70 interviews and a grand jury held three sessions said us 
attorney robert whitwell and james p turner acting assistant 
attorney general of the civil rights division of the justice 
department 
the comprehensive investigation revealed insufficient evidence 
of a violation of federal law and the fbi and grand jury cases are 
therefore being closed the statement said 
the teenager testified before the grand jury thursday he 
earlier met with the grand jury april 12 and said he gave the names 
of the attackers 
the case and another incident in which a louisville man 
threatened to castrate a black college student prompted a series of 
protest marches and a boycott of whiteowned businesses in march 
1988 
the castration threat resulted in a twoyear suspended prison 
term and three years federal probation last year for charles melton 
wells who pleaded guilty to sending threatening letters through the 
mail 
blacks have since continued to march every other saturday 
protest organizers said

an fbi agent who investigated the db cooper 
skyjacking said friday there are a number of similarities between 
cooper and a man recently arrested in an 18yearold new jersey 
multiple murder case 
ralph himmelsbach who retired in 1980 said friday that he 
believes cooper died when he parachuted from a boeing 727 over 
southwest washington in 1971 with 200000 in ransom but 
himmelsbach who led the cooper investigation still believes john 
e list should be investigated 
i would say hes a major suspect or at least i would consider 
him a major suspect himmelsbach said in a telephone interview 
as a fugitive after the killings of five members of his family 
list was considered a suspect in the skyjacking from the beginning 
himmelsbach said 
descriptions of list and cooper are similar both are accused of 
bizarre crimes and a fugitive from a mass murder has nothing to 
lose himmelsbach said 
a man police say is list was arrested june 1 in richmond va 
after the television show americas most wanted ran a program on 
the ballroom murders in november 1971 lists wife his 
87yearold mother and his three children were shot to death in 
their westfield nj mansion 
the man who goes by the name robert p clark and was described 
by friends as a quiet churchgoing accountant was extradited to 
new jersey on thursday and is in jail awaiting a court appearance 
although the man known as clark denies he is list authorities 
say fingerprints and a scar prove clark and list are the same man 
authorities say list fled to colorado and then virginia and had 
built a new life without changing his appearance or profession 
fbi spokesman john eyer in seattle said thursday that list was 
being investigated in the skyjacking but said it was routine 
david baugh lists lawyer in richmond before he was returned to 
new jersey compared the alleged connection to reported sightings of 
elvis presley 
on thanksgiving eve 18 years ago 15 days after the killings a 
passenger named dan cooper on a northwest airlines flight from 
portland gave a stewardess a note saying he had a bomb on the 
ground in seattle he released the passengers and most of the crew 
in return for 200000 and four parachutes when the plane headed 
for mexico the hijacker took the money and bailed out somewhere 
over southwest washington 
i would say first of all he list does fit the general 
description himmelsbach said the photograph of him 
contemporaneous with the hijacking resembles the artists conception 
of what he cooper looked like 
i understand that list received an inheritance and spent it 
of 200000 shortly before the killings the hijacker demanded 
200000 it might be a coincidence but it might also be a link 
list also had absolutely nothing to lose as a fugitive from 
justice with the heaviest penalty possible hanging over his head he 
had nothing whatever to lose by committing a daring and dangerous 
crime 
part of the ransom money 5800 in 20 bills was found on a 
columbia river sandbar in february 1980 himmelsbach thinks it 
washed down from an unknown site where cooper died 
but the case is the nations only unsolved skyjacking 
the former agent 63 is a private investigator at butte falls 
ore near medford

the federal judge in oliver norths irancontra 
case denied a motion for a mistrial friday saying a juror probably 
lied to the court but had no desire to help or to hurt north 
the ruling by us district court judge gerhard gesell clears the 
way for north to be sentenced wednesday

time in prison for armed robbery and that she had been questioned 
subpoenaed and testified before a grand jury in connection with that 
investigation 
at a wednesday hearing king testified that she had forgotten 
about the proceedings against her brother 
the court cannot credit kings testimony that she failed to 
mention her brother sams recent conviction by plea of guilty 
because she forgot gesell said in a ninepage ruling 
but he said no proof was presented indicating that king was 
unfair or that she failed in any way to serve conscientiously she 
voted to acquit north of many felony counts 
king was not biased for or against either side gesell said 
north who could be fined up to 750000 and sentenced to 10 
years in prison for the three felony convictions was acquitted on 
nine other charges 
norths lawyers hired a private detective agency to investigate

stopped months before norths trial

mayor tom bradley was sworn in to an 
unprecedented fifth term friday and he promised to press ahead with 
his social programs despite allegations of misconduct in office 
bradley 71 was cheered at the inauguration by thousands of 
supporters whose presence displaced the homeless people who usually 
recline beneath huge fig trees on the lawn 
i am determined that no difficulty will deflect us said 
bradley the subject of several investigations into allegations of 
financial wrongdoing including improper ties with banks that do 
business with the city 
the headlines will come and go the 30second sound bites will 
be heard and then fade and be forgotten the mayor said 
what will remain long after we are gone are the doors of 
opportunity that have been opened the air that has been cleaned 
the neighborhoods that have been given new life a generation that 
has been given new hope bradley said 
bradley promised increased efforts to control gangs and drug 
sales to press his plan to cut the number of trucks on city streets 
during rush hour by 70 percent and said he would soon announce a 
major program to keep storm drains from polluting bay waters the 
citys overtaxed sewage system repeatedly has overflowed and spilled 
into santa monica and san pedro bays 
bradley said he would settle for nothing less than 2 billion 
worth of tax increment revenues to be committed to the largest 
municipal housing and homeless plan in american history 
there is something fundamentally wrong in los angeles when 
10000 parents and their children are completely homeless when 
40000 of our families live in garages and 150000 pay more than 
half of their income for rent 
bradley has enjoyed relative popularity during his 16 years as 
mayor 
inaprils nonpartisan mayoral primary bradley defeated city 
councilman nate holden with 52 percent of the vote just enough to 
avoid a general election a far stronger opponent councilman zev 
yaroslavsky had pulled out of the race months earlier saying he 
believed the mayor was unbeatable 
in the previous election bradley was reelected with 67 percent 
of the vote 
bradley has failed twice in runs for governor in his first try 
he lost to george deukmejian in 1982 by just 12 percent of the vote 
recent newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to launch a 
conflictofinterest investigation of bradley on march 31 the state 
fair political practices commission later began its own probe 
questions arose about whether bradley had exchanged political 
favors for preferential treatment at drexel burnham lambert the 
investment banking firm that pioneered the use of controversial 
junk bonds 
the us justice department and the securities and exchange 
commission later opened additional investigations 
bradley told the city council on may 10 that he had done nothing 
illegal and would be vindicated

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze won 
unanimous confirmation from the new soviet legislature friday but 
lawmakers accused an economics minister of incompetence and he did 
not get a majority 
shevardnadze was the first cabinet member approved by the supreme 
soviet without questioning 
after shevardnadze sailed through confirmation of the nominee 
for the state foreign economic commission was postponed when he did 
not win a majority from the 542 members possibly because more than 
100 were absent all were present to raise their hands for 
shevardnadze 
he went to the podium and waited for questions but there were 
none the popular foreign minister has helped produce a nuclear arms 
limitation treaty withdrawal of the red army from afghanistan and 
vastly improved relations with neighbors china and iran 
the candidates authority among parliamentarians is so high 
that the decision was made without any consideration of the 
candidates program said tass the official news agency 
shevardnadze and other ministers were questioned in closed 
committee hearings earlier this week and the legislature exercised 
veto power over top officials for the first time forcing withdrawal 
of seven nominees 
confirmation of vladimir kamentsev as a deputy premier and head 
of the state foreign economic commission was postponed because he 
did not get the necessary 272 votes tass said the vote was 24697 
with 56 abstentions 
only 438 legislators had signed in and many were outside the hall 
when the vote on kamentsev was called 
by law a cabinet nominee is to earn at least 272 votes to be 
endorsed tass said and added that another vote would be taken 
later 
kamentsev was accused of being incompetent because foreign trade 
had decreased during his two years in office deputies said he had 
no clear strategy for increasing trade and ending the sovieet 
unions comparative isolation from the world economy 
tass said the legislature also was considering vitaly doguzhiev 
as head of a new commission on emergencies formed to coordinate 
response to disasters like the armenian earthquake and the explosion 
of leaking gas in central asia that engulfed two trains and killed 
600 people 
doguzhiev has been minister of general machinebuilding 
legislators approved nikolai laverov as deputy premier for

an investigation of allegations that white fbi 
agents in chicago racially harassed a black colleague was concluded 
without any criminal charges the justice department said friday 
the department said in a statement that it was unable to 
determine who wrote and sent two vicious hate letters to special 
agent donald rochon in 1985 while he was assigned to the fbis 
chicago field office 
evidence of other activities did not establish prosecutable 
federal criminal violations the department said in a brief 
statement 
the finding came nearly two years after the justice department 
found that rochon who is suing nine fbi agents was the victim of 
blatant racial harassment while assigned to the bureaus omaha 
neb field office 
rochon who was subsequently assigned to the chicago field office 
from 1984 to 1986 claims in the suit that that he was the victim of 
a campaign of racial harassment by white fbi agents 
david kairys a philadelphia attorney who represents rochon 
criticized the justice departments decision not to bring charges 
saying the evidence he had gathered since filing the lawsuit in 1987 
was sufficient for an indictment of racial harassment 
the role of the justice department has been to cover up and 
ignore this series of events kairys said 
rochon now assigned to the fbi office in philadelphia claims 
his familys safety was threatened with anonymous telephone calls to 
his unlisted number and that he was threatened with dismissal if he 
pressed harassment claims to state authorities 
one letter contained threats to castrate rochon and rape his 
wife susan who is white the letter contained a picture of the 
dismembered body of a black man 
the second letter contained a picture of a bullseye with a 
picture of a black mans face 
gary w miller a white fbi agent who invoked the fifth amendment 
during a deposition taken in connection with the lawsuit 
acknowledged during a 1985 statement to his superiors that he 
discussed seeking retribution against rochon with a colleague 
thomas j dillon 
dillon and miller are among nine fbi agents named as defendants 
in the lawsuit pending in federal courts here and in chicago 
kairys said that miller said during the deposition that he had 
been informed by the justice department that he was a target of the 
criminal investigation 
kairys said an fbi test of millers typewriters to determine if 
he had typed one of the two 1985 letters produced inconclusive 
results 
miller stated in the 1985 affidavit that he forged rochons 
signature on an application for a death and dismemberment policy for 
the black agents family 
the insurance policy was mailed to rochons home after he 
received the first hate letter kairys said 
miller who was suspended for two weeks without pay said he only 
intended to send junk mail to rochon but miller acknowledged that 
he sought personal revenge against rochon for making racial 
harassment charges against dillon when the two agents worked in 
omaha 
it was my way of putting a burr under his saddle miller said 
in the statement 
miller was suspended for two weeks without pay as a result of the 
fbi internal investigation

federal prosecutors are looking into 
allegations that a montgomery real estate broker kept more than 2 
million that he was supposed to send to the us department of 
housing and urban development spending nearly 180000 on cars 
us attorney jim wilson of montgomery on friday declined to 
comment about the alabama hud case or the broker identified in hud 
documents as cy walker wilson said he could not comment on pending 
investigative matters with a meeting scheduled with hud officials 
in about two weeks to review various potential cases 
an audit said the hud money was placed in walkers bank account 
from which more than 1 million in checks had been written to cash 
another 179478 went to car dealers 75634 to retail stores and 
businesses 238000 to individuals or associates and smaller 
amounts to others 
the bank account was depleted and closed on nov 9 1987 the day 
after walker allegedly pulled out of the offices of ricks 
linddavis real estate inc in montgomery 
attempts to reach walker for comment were unsuccessful friday a 
cy walker is listed in the montgomery residence phone book but the 
number has been disconnected knox argo a montgomery attorney who 
previously handled some closings with walker said he had not seen 
him in about a year 
the audit by the office of inspector general charged that an 
associate broker with ricks linddavis real estate inc failed to 
send hud 2011915 from 67 sales closings that he handled for the 
federal agency 
the audit covering from august 1984 to november 1987 also found 
that the company was late in remitting to hud another 389 million 
from 148 sales costing the government about 323000 in lost 
interest 
no individuals were named in the audit but documents in huds 
board of contract appeals case file identify walker as the associate 
broker 
a complaint filed with the hud appeal board by ricks linddavis 
said walker handled the hud closings and controlled all the bank 
account records and files the qualifying broker for the firm 
johnny m portis did not learn about the missing hud money until 
after walker abandoned the premises of the firm on nov 8 1987 
taking all the hud files with him according to the complaint filed 
by portis attorney 
joseph carpenter a montgomery attorney represents ricks 
linddavis and portis who closed down the companys operations and 
sold parts of it to another firm on jan 1 1989 he said portis did 
not know about the unremitted hud funds until after walker left the 
firm 
according to the audit officials with the firm said they were 
not responsible for the 2011915 in unremitted sales proceeds the 
ricks linddavis officials according to the audit said the hud 
contract was with an associate broker for the firm and that when 
they purchased the company in 1986 the former owners told them that 
the associate broker had the hud account 
accordingly the audit said the ricks linddavis officials 
did not research or even review the contract with hud to handle 
closings but continued to let things operate as they were before 
the purchase because their relationship with the associate broker 
was one of trust 
the audit said that the hud contract required the firm as the 
area management broker for the federal agency to establish an 
escrow account in the name of the firm and hud instead the audit 
said the firm allowed an associate broker to establish a regular 
commercial checking account although hud appeared in the bank 
account name we learned that this associate broker had sole control 
over the bank account 
in addition this broker collected all proceeds from the sale 
of hud properties 
according to hud officials when the agency tried to see records 
from the account the broker refused to authorize it the audit said 
its findings were based on subpoenaed documents along with hud 
records

the department of housing and urban development 
ignored repeated warnings to take action against lenders including 
one currently under grand jury investigation the agencys inspector 
general said friday 
on at least five occasions we have reported to hud 
management and to congress that program improvements were needed 
said hud inspector general paul a adams as the house subcommittee 
on employment and housing began hearings to investigate the troubled 
program 
we concluded that inappropriate lender underwriting practices 
caused inflated mortgages as early as november 1985 adams said 
but he said hud managment criticized him for overstating the 
problems and rejected controls he suggested as too strict however 
he said officials kept assuring him they were taking steps to 
improve lender monitoring processes and enforcement actions 
meanwhile 
in montgomery ala federal attorneys are looking into 
allegations that a montgomery real estate broker kept more than 2 
million that he was supposed to send to hud spending nearly 
180000 on cars 
in washington rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said the whole 
nation is appalled in fact sickened by the revelations of the 
looting at hud during the reagan administration 
housing secretary jack kemp is scheduled to appear july 12 before 
the house banking committee which gonzalez heads to discuss reform 
measures being instituted 
in the senate one staffer said senate banking committee chairman 
donald riegle dmich has sent a letter to panel members seeking 
authorization for an investigation sen alan cranston dcalif 
chairman of the subcommittee on housing said friday he would vote 
for a probe of the scandalridden department 
in a separate matter kemp late thursday cancelled a 500 million 
mortgage loan guarantee program that helped finance such things as 
street construction and sewer lines for smaller developers who 
included low and moderateincome housing in their projects 
the department found that nearly half of the 58 projects financed 
through the program had defaulted on loans and cost the government 
90 million 
this program was an absolute disaster said hud spokesman bob 
nipp 
the coinusrance mortgage program was started in 1983 as a 
hallmark of reagan administration efforts to privitize many 
government programs 
under the program private lenders offer loans for the repair 
rehabilitation or construction of low and moderateincome 
multifamily housing 
lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a projects 
operating income if a loan defaults lenders are responsible for 
about 20 percent of the loss while hud picks up the tab for the 
remaining 80 percent 
claims filed against hud as of september 1988 total over 100 
million with more claims expected in the next several months 
said rep tom lantos dcalif subcommittee chairman 
in his most recent program audit in march 1989 adams found one 
lender benton mortgage company of knoxville tenn had 
misrepresented mortgage amounts and rents on 14 projects it had 
underwritten 
adams estimated bentons mortgages were excessive by 22 million 
he also said the government would pay excessive rent subsidies of 
37 milllion over the 15year period of contracts for rental housing 
benton had coinsured 
benton is one of three companies which has been placed on a 
sixmonth probation from the program three companies have been 
suspended indefinitely and three others are under close watch 
review by hud adams said 
adams revealed friday that benton is the subject of a grand jury 
investigation 
when rep bruce morrison dconn asked adams whether he was 
investigating relationships between developers consultants and 
benton mortgage the inspector general replied im not at liberty 
to discuss an ongoing investigation a subject of a grand jury 
investigation 
morrison dropped that line of questioning when lantos warned it 
might jeopardize the grand jurys probe 
the housing and employment subcommittee also is investigating 
alleged abuse influencepeddling and mismanagement in hud programs 
to fix up rundown housing complexes for the poor 
adams said his first report of problems in the coinsurance 
program was sent to thenassistant secretary of housing phil abrams 
one of several former hud employees who was paid as a consultant on 
projects funded under a hud program

an influential house of commons committee rejected 
calls to let 35 million british passport holders in hong kong 
immigrate to britain and it recommended an international effort to 
accommodate them in the event of a crisis 
the foreign affairs select committee report also recommended the 
speedy introduction of full democracy in hong kong so it would be in 
place before china takes over the colony in 1997 
hong kong legislators greeted the report with outrage and said 
the committees statement on the immigration issue will probably go 
down as one of the most dishonorable statements ever made about 
hong kong 
britains foreign affairs select committee said it was 
unrealistic to expect such a large influx to be accommodated in 
britain but it did recommend that thousands be allowed to 
immigrate especially those holding key and sensitive positions in 
hong kong 
we believe the accommodation of even several million people 
from hong kong would be quite possible if shared amongst the 
international community it said 
the committee rejected the contention of foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe that other countries would not now make a commitment 
to take hong kong residents in case of a future crisis 
it urged britain to take the lead at the earliest opportunity 
particularly with the european community australia canada and 
the united states in establishing the definite guarantees which 
could be put into place in the years ahead 
this idea the hong kong legislators replied betrays any 
desire by the committee to understand let alone accept that 
there is a confidence crisis in hong kong now which clearly calls 
for immediate action it fails to recognize britains constitutional 
responsibility for its subjects now or in the future 
the report was started before the chinese government ordered the 
army to crush the prodemocracy movement on june 34 but the fears 
the crackdown raised in hong kong were at the heart of many of the 
committees recommendations 
the chinese government has said 200 to 300 people died in the 
crackdown but chinese diplomats and western intelligence reports 
say up to 3000 were killed 
the chinese governments ruthless suppression of calls within 
china for progress towards democracy and the extreme language of 
its denunciation of hong kong support for those calls seriously 
challenges the belief that china will now and even more after 1997 
encourage the development of democracy in hong kong the committee 
warned 
it said china should provide stronger guarantees that it will 
maintain hong kongs autonomy and capitalist system after 1997 to 
reestablish the confidence and trust of the colonys 57 million 
residents 
the committee said hong kong residents must be allowed to decide 
on their own system of government both before and after 1997 and 
urged the introduction of full democracy as soon as possible 
it recommended that direct elections for hong kongs entire 
legislative council be held in 1995 and that 50 percent of the 
council be directly elected in 1990 as a first stage hong kongs 
first chief executive should be elected by an electoral college six 
months before the transfer of sovereignty to china it said 
the report also called on britain to make clear to china the 
strength of hong kongs opposition to any stationing of peoples 
liberation army soldiers in the colony after 1997

president bush stood before the iwo jima 
statue of flagraising marines friday to press for a constitutional 
amendment against desecration of the american flag the fabric of 
our nation 
bush is pushing for a proposed amendment drafted by republican 
congressional leaders that would set aside last weeks supreme 
court ruling that extended freedomofspeech protection to people 
who burn the flag as a form of political protest 
our purpose today transcends politics and patriotism bush 
told an audience of several hundred that included many 
administration officials and gop members of congress 
the president praised the amendments language as stark 
simple and to the point the proposal states the congress and 
the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of 
the flag of the united states 
critics have said such an amendment would open the door for 
erosion of the constitutions guarantees of freedom of speech and 
have said bush is endangering the first amendment for political gain 
but bush said this amendment preserves the widest conceivable 
range of options for free expression it applies only to the flag 
the unique symbol of our nation 
later house speaker thomas s foley told reporters at the white 
house he prefers legislation to altering the constitution to 
accomplish what he says is a worthwhile goal 
my view is that before we amend the constitution we should 
approach the question with a statutory change foley said we 
have to be extraordinarily careful before we amend the first 
amendment which is the basic foundation document for freedom of 
speech freedom of religion and freedom of the press 
bush made his appearance at the iwo jima memorial a popular 
landmark on the banks of the potomac before leaving washington in 
early afternoon for a fiveday fourth of july vacation at his family 
complex in kennebunkport maine 
after the flag event bush met with albertina sisulu a south 
african antiapartheid activist telling her he would ask congress 
to increase aid to south african blacks and addressed a white house 
ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the civil rights act 
of 1964 
bush told members of the civil rights audience they were gathered 
not only to commemorate an anniversary but to celebrate a 
movement and to rededicate our efforts to the unfinished work of 
that movement 
earlier bush declared our flag will not be desecrated as he 
stood in bright sunlight before the bronze statue of six marines 
holding aloft a huge american flag the flag itself is cloth and 
fluttered gently in a light morning breeze 
to the touch this flag is merely fabric but to the heart the 
flag represents and reflects the fabric of our nation our dreams 
our destiny our very fiber as a people bush said 
joining him at the ceremony were senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan house minority leader robert michel rill and two 
democratic sponsors of the amendment sen alan j dixon of illinois 
and rep gv sonny montgomery of mississippi 
michel said he had been promised speedy consideration of the 
proposal in the house by foley dwash to take effect the 
amendment requires approval by twothirds majorities in both the 
house and senate and then ratification by at least 38 state 
legislatures 
on the flight to maine presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the administration would like to see it passed as soon as 
possible but i dont think weve been given any timetable for how 
soon that might happen 
the amendment would have the effect of overturning the supreme 
courts 54 decision that nullified flagdesecration statutes in 48 
states 
dole said that there is outrage around the nation over the 
ruling that people are saying keep your hands off old glory 
the iwo jima memorial depicts the flag raising by warweary 
marines atop mount suribachi after the us victory over japanese 
forces in the world war ii battle of iwo jima a small volcanic 
island in the pacific 
these marines wrote a profile in courage said bush who as a 
world war ii navy pilot was shot down in the pacific not far from 
iwo jima 
today we remember one of the most vivid images of our flag 
the one you see behind me joe rosenthals stunning photograph 
immortalized in bronze rosenthal was a photographer for the 
associated press when he snapped the pulitzer prizewinning image in 
1945 
the only surviving marine from the group john bradley of 
antigo wis said after the court decision i couldnt believe my 
ears when i heard they ruled that way 
bradley said in a june 23 milwaukee sentinel story the flag is 
a symbol of our country that everyone holds dear to their hearts i 
couldnt understand how they came to that decision 
bradley a funeral director in his small northern wisconsin town 
said we ought to have the utmost respect for the flag the symbol 
of a free nation 
he said he has buried people who fought under the flag and he 
added when taps are played i think everyone feels the same way 
with chills running up and down your spine 
bush was to remain at his oceanside home in kennebunkport through 
wednesday morning aides said he had no public appearances scheduled 
and that the trip was mainly for rest and relaxation 
however a large crowd was expected to gather at various 
beachfront locations at dusk the night before independence day to 
watch a fireworks display at bushs complex at walkers point 
famed fireworks artist george zambelli was hired by an anonymous 
benefactor to put on what he says will be a 15minute performance 
that will expend about two tons of fireworks

irans parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani said friday that the islamic republics relations with 
the soviet union could have an important impact in the region and in 
the world tehran radio reported 
rafsanjani considered the most powerful man in iran and likely 
to be elected president in july 28 elections headed a highranking 
delegation to the soviet union this month 
we have many natural resources and the soviets have many means 
which together can benefit both countries the radio monitored in 
nicosia quoted him as saying in a sermon 
in baghdad iraq the soviet first deputy foreign minister 
alexander a bessmertnykh arrived friday on a previously 
unannounced visit apparently seeking to calm iraqi concern at 
moscows military and economic agreements with iran 
soviet embassy officials said he met his iraqi counterpart 
wissam alzahawi and was due to have talks with foreign minister 
tareq aziz later 
he is expected to meet with president saddam hussein before 
flying back to moscow sunday 
bessmertnykh told reporters he carried a letter from soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev for saddam but declined to disclose 
its contents 
iran needs outside help to replenish its depleted military 
hardware and to rebuild industries destroyed in the 8year iraniraq 
war which was halted last august by a unbrokered ceasefire 
iranian diplomat sirous nasseri told a news conference at un 
headquarters in new york friday that iraniraq talks were making no 
progress and a settlement was further away now than when 
unmediated talks began 10 months ago 
francois giuliani spokesman for secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar later denied no progress had been made saying in answer 
to a question that obviously the secretarygeneral would not 
continue a process which is moving backward and which is useless 
tehran radio quoted rafsanjani as saying friday that if iran and 
the soviet union can have relations like two free countries 
without expectations or an eye to taking advantage of each other 
there will be a security under which we can regain many of the 
usurped interests of the region and that is why the westerners are 
horrified 
he justified undertaking the soviet trip so soon after ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis death on june 3 by saying the revolutionary 
patriarch had himself given the blessing to better relations with 
the soviets 
rafsanjani recounted the longterm 6 billion pact signed in 
moscow whereby the soviets will help iran in oil exploration prop 
up its arms industry and build dams power plants and railways in 
return for exports of iranian natural gas 
he said soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan last february 
and more religious freedoms in the soviet union had been conducive 
to better relations between moscow and tehran the radio reported

the venerable treaty oak withering from a 
powerful poison poured on its roots will live on through seedlings 
grown by a man who picnicked beneath its branches as a child 
gordon israel who lives across the street from the centuriesold 
oak has about 80 seedlings grown from acorns he gathered last year 
in what was to be a business venture 
i dont know what to do now israel said friday adding that 
he didnt want to capitalize on the poisoning 
police on thursday arrested paul cullen 45 and charged him with 
felony criminal mischief in the pouring of the herbicide velpar 
around the tree cullen was being held in lieu of 20000 bond 
if something does happen that the treaty oak isnt saved or 
something i would hope that some of these seedlings would end up in 
that park said israel 37 the oak stands in a small park near 
downtown austin 
authorities said the poisoning may have occurred during some sort 
of ritual sgt john jones who investigated the case said 
ritualrelated items and occult books were found in a search of 
cullens makeshift trailer south of austin in elroy 
israel said he is optimistic about survival of the tree which 
has a special significance for him he chose his home because it is 
near the 50foot oak and said he remembers stories of stephen f 
austin and the tree on a gradeschool visit to the park 
legend says austin a founding father of texas signed the first 
boundary line agreement between indians and settlers under the oaks 
branches but the handbook of texas says there is little foundation 
for the tale 
israel said that since the poisoning became public a lot of 
people have really shown that they care and thats real neat i 
guess thats the most positive thing that you can draw from this 
whole experience 
getwell messages flowers and a can of creamofchicken soup are 
among the items that have been left at the tree 
israel has given away some seedlings since the poisoning 
including one to a couple married at the oak 
the treaty oak is struggling to survive the poisoning since it 
was discovered early this month state and national experts have 
recommended several forms of treatment but it was not known if the 
tree would live 
those experts also have advised israel on caring for the 
seedlings he said

the united states and taiwan initialed a 
tentative north pacific driftnet agreement friday just hours after 
the taiwanese were given 60 days to sign and implement such a pact 
or face possible trade sanctions on their fishery products 
the agreement allows for the high seas boarding of taiwanese 
driftnet vessels suspected of illegally catching us salmon and 
requires the placement of satellite transponders on all of the 166 
taiwanese ships involved 
the united states will use the transponders to keep track of the 
taiwanese fleet and us observers will be allowed to board 
taiwanese vessels to monitor their catch 
we drove a hard bargain and got what looks like a workable 
agreement said rep jolene unsoeld dwash clearly the threat 
of sanctions gave taiwan the incentive to work something out 
the agreement was reached shortly after midnight friday and 
initialed friday afternoon said brian gorman a spokesman for the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
secretary of commerce robert mosbacher had told president bush 
late thursday that efforts to reach agreement with taiwan and south 
korea over the use of the driftnets by their fishing fleets had 
failed 
under a 1987 law thursday was the deadline for reaching and 
implementing such monitoring and enforcement agreements a 60day 
time clock started running and if agreements were still not in force 
by the end of that period the administration could impose an 
embargo or other trade sanctions on taiwanese and korean fishery 
products 
taiwanese exports to the united states mostly tuna and shrimp 
were valued at 372 million last year and korean exports mostly 
pollock and oysters were valued at 250 million 
gorman said that once the treaty is formally signed and 
implemented mosbacher would ask bush to lift the threat of trade 
sanctions against taiwan 
state department officials have said talks with the koreans may 
resume in july but no definite date has been set a previous round 
of talks with the koreans in may failed to produce any progress

the government froze wages and prices 
friday for a month citing a race between the two that 
threatened further crisis in an already chaotic economy 
the moratorium will allow the new national assembly which 
includes members from the solidarity oppsition movement to convene 
and begin work on economic reform 
because of the significance and the social effects of the new 
market orientation the economy should be a subject of 
consideration by the newly elected parliament said a statement 
released after a cabinet meeting led by prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski 
among proposals awaiting legislative action is the indexing of 
wages to prices under which pay increases would cover 80 percent of 
inflation indexing was agreed upon in negotiations between the 
government and opposition that ended in april 
inflation is officially projected at 60 percent for 1989 but is 
running at an annual rate of more than 100 percent 
to stop the fatal tendencies of the economy the council of 
ministers decided to take radical actions to end the race of price 
and pay the cabinet statement said 
the freeze follows sharp price increases for some stateproduced 
goods including 66 percent for sugar and an average 83 percent for 
tobacco products prices of alcoholic beverages gasoline and 
appliances also went up 
speculation about the possibility of other price increases 
especially for meat led producers to withhold goods making 
shortages worse 
in moving toward a marketoriented economy the government wants 
to narrow the gap between production costs and prices which 
previously were kept artificially low by subsidies 
the cabinet noted alarming phenomena in crop and animal 
production due to continuing declines in profits for farmers which 
it said threatens a serious destabilization of the food market in 
the second half of the year

the federal communications commission cleared 
the way friday for a historic change in the way prices are 
established by the nations largest longdistance provider the 
american telephone amp telegraph co 
the commission denied challenges by atampt competitors and the 
state of alaska to a new pricing method that goes into effect 
saturday 
the new plan which the fcc adopted in march following two years 
of debate imposes caps on how much atampt can charge since the 
1960s the fcc has regulated how much atampt could earn above its 
costs 
the fcc which has said the new price cap plan could save 
telephone users 900 million over four years on friday rejected 
assertions by the challengers that atampt had failed to provide enough 
evidence to justify its new pricing schedule and that atampt had 
calculated certain rates improperly 
the challengers wanted the fcc to fully investigate the inaugural 
price cap plan which atampt claims will lower prices 140 million 
immediately 100 million for residential customers 
atampt said it will lower charges for its basic longdistance 
rates its reach out america service and for international calling 
one of the challengers the competitive telecommunications 
association comptel claimed atampt was achieving the 140 million 
cut not by price caps but by flowing through to its customers 
previously ordered fcc price cuts 
under the old rateofreturn regulatory system atampts 
longdistance rates have dropped 38 percent since 1984 but much of 
that decrease has resulted from higher prices consumers have been 
paying to connect to local telephone networks 
with consumers paying more longdistance companies have paid 
less to the local telephone networks and the fcc has forced atampt to 
pass along flow through those savings to its longdistance 
customers 
in rejecting the challenges friday the commission said atampt had 
complied with its april price cap order in setting the new rates and 
it was not flowing through savings 
the commission said it found some deficiencies in atampt 
documents supporting its new prices but that the flaws were not so 
serious as to warrant investigation 
the tariff will therefore not be set for investigation said 
gerald brock chief of the commissions common carrier bureau 
besides comptel the challengers were alascom inc allnet 
communications services inc us sprint communications co and the 
national telecommunications network the state of alaska had joined 
alascom in challenging the rates for service to alaska 
earlier in the week the commission also rejected challenges to 
price caps filed by the puerto rico telephone co and la telefonica 
larga distancia a puerto rican longdistance company the 
commission had denied the puerto rican companies claims that price 
caps were not in the public interest 
the price cap plan allows atampt which in 1988 controlled 68 
percent of the us longdistance market to raise rates 3 
percentage points less than the rate of inflation in three 
categories of service residential and small business 800 calls 
and other business services mainly for large customers 
atampt can raise or lower rates up to 5 percent for individual 
services within these categories by giving 14 days notice to the 
fcc which will presume the changes to be lawful the burden of 
proof then would be on challengers to prove the changes were illegal 
if rate changes fall outside the price cap parameters then the 
fcc will investigate 
the fcc has said the plan is intended to give atampt an incentive 
to cut costs 
the commission also has proposed to impose price caps on the 
seven bell regional phone companies beginning in july 1990

31yearold veteran said im here now to complete it 
yaqoub an agronomist before the war has the job of landscaping 
parks and palm groves in the new town 
he and the others have thousands of bulldozers graders 
mechanical diggers mobile cranes cement mixers and trucks to help 
with the work in blistering heat that reaches 120 degrees fahrenheit 
they moved to faw last week from basra the ancient port 70 miles 
to the north where they had worked around the clock for three 
months 
iraq claims the iranians suffered more than 120000 casualties in 
the faw battles and acknowledges 50000 of its own the government

the head of an association representing senior 
federal executives said friday the group will vigorously oppose 
any pay raise proposal which fails to provide an acrosstheboard 
increase for all members of the senior executive service 
president bush said in a speech thursday that he would work 
with congress on the development of details for increasing the pay 
of those in congress as well as other senior employees of the 
executive branch 
a fact sheet released by the white house said bush will send to 
congress in the next few days a package that will include a 25 
percent pay increase for judges as well as an increase for a limited 
number of specialized professionals such as scientists and surgeons 
strong criticism of that initial phase of the pay raise plan came 
from carol a bonosaro president of the senior executives 
association 
she said the group was adamantly opposed to any pay proposal 
that calls for pay increases only for selective positions within the 
senior executive service scientific and technical community and for 
the federal judiciary 
while we understand the extraordinary difficulty of retaining 
and recruiting senior scientists and surgeons we will vigorously 
oppose any pay increase proposal that does not call for an 
acrosstheboard increase for all senior executive service 
positions ms bonosaro said 
alixe glen a white house spokeswoman said it was premature for 
anyone to criticize the president because bush has made no formal 
announcement of a specific pay raise proposal 
the president hasnt decided what exactly he would like to see 
happen regarding an executive branch pay raise ms glen said 
white house officials have said bush wants to put out his 
specific proposal before he leaves for europe july 9

a federal appeals court friday lifted a ban on 
drug testing for justice department employees who have topsecret 
security clearances 
however the court left intact a permanent injunction on random 
drug testing for justice department lawyers responsible for 
conducting grand jury proceedings and employees who prosecute 
criminal cases 
the court suggested that the department consider limiting testing 
to personnel who handle drug prosecutions 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the department would 
consider seeking further court review of parts of the opinion with 
which we disagree or to refocus the program 
the departments plans for random drug testing covered about 
1300 employees with topsecret clearances as well as about 400 
criminal prosecutors and 750 personnel with access to grand jury 
information 
in a decision written by chief us circuit court of appeals 
judge patricia wald the court rejected the departments request to 
lift the injunction issued by a federal district court last summer 
the injunction resulted from a lawsuit by 38 justice department 
attorneys 
wald said us supreme court decisions require the injunction to 
be modified to permit testing of employees with topsecret 
clearances 
the supreme court in a drugtesting case involving the us 
customs service said the government had a compelling interest in 
protecting truly sensitive information 
the department argued that the duties of its workers covered by 
the drugtesting plan raised comparable public safety concerns as 
those in the customs service and on railroads where drug testing 
has been upheld 
we do not agree wald wrote certainly a blunder by a 
justice department lawyer may lead through a chain of ensuing 
circumstances to a threat to public safety 
that sort of indirect risk however is wholly different from 
the risk posed by a worker who carries a gun or operates a train 
wald was joined in the opinion by judge spottswood robinson 
judge laurence silberman dissented to part of the decision

czechoslovakia for what communist authorities said was his 
participation in public demonstrations the state department said 
friday 
while rejecting the charges against robert norman a political 
officer in charge of monitoring human rights the department said

carefully the human rights situation in czechoslovakia the 
department said in a statement 
the czechoslovak diplomat jan fejgl a first secretary at the

a judge on friday gave custody of an 
orphaned toddler friday to his mothers longtime female companion 
rather than the boys blood relatives 
i have been coparenting collin susan bellemare 33 told a 
vermont probate judge as she fought to win custody of the 
15monthold i would parent the child i would love him nurture 
him 
bellemare was named guardian of collin hamilton in the will of 
susan hamilton who died in a car accident in may hamiltons 
parents are challenging the will claiming they or hamiltons 
sister kathleen would be a better guardian 
no one involved in the case would characterize the relationship 
of the two women who owned a home together and reportedly exchanged 
wedding rings they were companions for a dozen years and lived 
together while raising the baby who was conceived by artificial 
insemination 
were not trying to cast aspersions on anybody said patrick 
monaghan jr lawyer for the grandparents philip and elsa hamilton 
of montvale nj the person forgotten in this proceeding is the 
child and what is in the best interests of the child 
the grandparents attended fridays hearing but did not testify 
susan hamiltons brother tom called the decision disgusting 
this other susan she is not even blood he said 
judge l john cain awarded temporary custody to bellemare 
allowing the grandparents visitation rights after asking bellemare 
about her health and her ability to raise the child on her own 
bellemare who was injured in the accident that killed hamilton 
used a cane to walk to the witness stand she said she saw a doctor 
two weeks ago who told her to get on with my life 
im back at work im driving said bellemare a nurse im 
back at home and able to provide for the child 
bellemare hamilton and the baby were returning from a weekend 
trip in may when their car was struck by a truck 
another hearing was set for august attorneys representing the 
boys grandparents would not say whether they planned to appeal the 
judges temporary custody order 
still to be determined is whether the will is valid and thus 
whether bellemare is the legal guardian if the will is accepted 
cain said later the grandparents would then have to petition the 
probate court if they wanted to set aside the guardianship

neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom 
of night stays the us postal service from delivering mail to john 
geddings but geddings oneman protest has had an effect 
geddings said he stopped doing business with the postal service 
five years ago when it raised the price of stamps to 22 cents and 
hes not about to start mailing or getting letters now 
he pays his utility bills in person no longer has credit cards 
and doesnt receive a single piece of junk mail 
i just buy what i need and i dont have to buy a 25cent stamp 
to send payments in geddings said friday the postal service is 
the one thats losing they have to return my mail to the sender 
geddings battle with the post office began in 1984 when he 
received a letter from the us postal service asking him to 
voluntarily put up a mailbox by the curb 
they said it would help curtail postage costs and help prevent 
rate increases said geddings who had had mail delivered to his 
door for 28 years 
he complied but 30 days later the cost of stamps went from 20 
cents to 22 cents geddings pulled out his mailbox his mail 
delivery stopped 
postmaster earl reese said postal service policy prohibits door 
delivery in areas that have curbside delivery although putting up a 
curbside box is voluntary once a box goes up door delivery cannot 
be reinstated unless the resident is handicapped 
we did eveything we could to get geddings mail to him reese 
said in fact we offered to come out and furnish the post and 
mailbox its unusual for us to do that 
we hate to have an unsatisfied customer reese added im 
really embarrassed about it 
in an effort to accommodate geddings the local post office held 
his mail longer than the customary 60 days but he wouldnt pick it 
up reese said 
and when postal officials tried to put geddings mail in his 
wifes post office box which she rents for herself and her son 
geddings asked them to stop 
she dont exactly go along with my idea and i try not to get 
her involved geddings said 
his protests didnt end there he wrote to postal officials 
including the us postmaster generals office in washington and to 
south carolinas two us senators strom thurmond and ernest 
hollings 
in 1988 without a satisfactory response and still without door 
delivery geddings erected a sign in his front yard to call 
attention to his oneman war against the postal service 
the postal service refuses to deliver mail to this home the 
sign reads in bold letters 
reese said thats not necessarily true 
i would still go out there and put his mailbox up at the curb 
if it would make him happy he said i would like to have him 
back as a customer 
he said the curbside delivery method is safer faster and more 
economical but geddings said his neighborhood has been singled out 
because i guess they think were second class citizens or 
something 
you can go to the highrent district and see them taking 
mail to the door he said

the military government explaining recent 
arrests on friday accused the leading opposition party of creating 
unrest 
also friday fighting raged around a karen guerrilla base near 
the thai border in a government offensive that left at least 25 
burmese troops and two rebels dead this week thai border police 
said 
as part of an intensified crackdown on dissent authorities on 
tuesday and wednesday arrested four student leaders and four 
politicians including a senior member of the national league for 
democracy 
the national league for democracy has been systematically 
creating unrest chief government spokesman kyaw sann told a 
news conference he claimed league leaders aung san suu kyi and tin 
oo have been urging people to defy the laws as a duty during 
their political campaigning 
we warn them again that they will have to bear the consequences 
of such irresponsible acts the spokesman said 
the league on friday attacked the recent arrests as 
manifestation of political persecution by the military rulers 
who seized control of power last september and brutally crushed a 
studentled prodemocracy uprising 
the government has allowed formation of opposition parties and 
promised elections next year but the league and other opposition 
groups have charged the government is creating a climate of fear and 
repression that will make free elections impossible 
the thai border police speaking anonymously said fridays 
fighting occurred around the karen rebel camp of pa loo which 
burmese troops attacked tuesday killing at least two rebels and 
wounding 14 others 
the attack left at least 25 troops dead and 35 others wounded 
the police said 
several thousand burmese soldiers backed by heavy mortar and 
artillery fire began attacking pa loo and nearby kaw moo ra in may 
the karen rebels with about 8000 armed fighters are the 
largest of a dozen ethnic groups that have fought for four decades 
for greater autonomy in burma 
thai military sources said about 185 burmese soldiers had been 
killed and and at least 470 wounded in attacks before june 15 on kaw 
moo ra and pa loo they reported only six karens killed and 17 
wounded 
about 1000 karen civilians living near the battle zones have 
fled to thailand since the fighting for the two bases began more 
than 250 thais have been forced to flee their homes in the village 
of ban wang kaew across the border from kaw moo ra 
karen sources said this week that the burmese had recently 
strengthened their assault force to 5000 men they had also 
bolstered mortar positions in the hills to the west of the two 
camps they said

president bush on friday signed a bill 
extending until april 1 the governments legal authority to operate 
the strategic petroleum reserve 
the reserve contains 570 million barrels of crude oil almost a 
threemonths supply of imports in salt domes along the texas and 
louisiana coasts 
the bill requires the secretary of energy to study different 
financing arrangements for expanding the reserve to 1 billion 
barrels the current goal is 750 million barrels and the new law 
authorizes additions at 60000 to 75000 barrels per day 
also studied will be the issue of when the oil can be used 
current law permits the president to draw on the reserve only in the 
event of a major disruption in imports a disruption in domestic 
supplies such as the interruption of shipments from alaska after the 
march grounding of the tanker exxon valdez there would not permit a 
president to use the stockpile even if it were desirable 
i would have preferred a simple 5year extension of the spr 
authority bush said in a statement 
the reserve is aimed at cushioning the impact of any disruption 
of oil imports such as those of 1973 and 1979 the government has 
spent 6 billion buying oil for the salt domes since 1975 most of 
it from mexico

a federal judge on friday overturned a 
state law requiring girls age 17 or under to get their parents 
permission for an abortion saying the statute was 
unconstitutionally vague 
the law passed by the legislature in 1988 was to take effect 
saturday 
the statutes vagueness can be expected to have a substantial 
chilling effect upon a minors right to obtain an abortion said 
us district judge john t nixon in ruling from the bench after 
about an hour of oral arguments 
the national planned parenthood federation and the american civil 
liberties union of tennessee challenged the law seeking a 
preliminary injunction blocking its enforcement until the issue 
could be decided 
but nixon said there was no need for an injunction and further 
hearings because the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its 
face 
the law would have made it a misdemeanor for a doctor to perform 
an abortion on a minor without first obtaining written permission 
from both her parents or her legal guardian 
the statute allows exceptions however if the parents are 
divorced if the pregnant girl wins a court waiver of the consent 
requirement or if one parent cannot be found within a reasonable 
time and manner 
the phrase reasonable time and manner is so vague as to fail 
to give the physician notice as to when his actions will violate the 
statute and subject him to criminal sanctions nixon said that 
violates the doctors right to due process under the 14th amendment 
he said 
nixon said uncertainty about the laws meaning would lead doctors 
to protect themselves by denying abortions to minors who cant 
locate one of their parents 
the judge ruled on every single ground on which we alleged the 
law was unconstitutional said dara klassel attorney for planned 
parenthood 
klassel argued that the twoparent requirement was too broad when 
one parent doesnt live in the girls home a parent can stall the 
abortion by mere lack of interest she said 
deputy attorney general michael catalano said the state will 
consider an appeal to the 6th circuit court after reviewing the 
ruling 
its our contention that the statute is constitutional he 
said we intend to pursue the case to that end 
catalano said the case could be affected by a forthcoming ruling 
from the us supreme court which has been asked to reverse its 
landmark 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to 
abortion 
the justices could rule monday or order another round of 
arguments delaying the decision until next year 
in florida earlier this week a lawyer told the state supreme 
court that privacy laws should be extended to minors to allow them 
an abortion without parental consent 
the florida law requires unmarried minors to get permission from 
their parents or a judge before having an abortion the case being 
argued began when attorney jerri blairs client a 15yearold known 
only as tw did not want to tell her parents about her 
pregnancy then in its 11th week and sought judicial permission 
for an abortion 
a lake county judge denied her request last month saying the 
state law was vague and unworkable an appeals court then ruled the 
law unconstitutional and a series of legal maneuvers landed the case 
in the us supreme court which returned the case to the state 
justices without comment 
the us supreme court has left the law unenforceable until the 
florida high court reviews it

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
tumbled 27 percent in may the steepest drop in 10 months the 
government reported friday providing more evidence of a weakening 
economy caused by high interest rates 
the big decline indicates the economy is slowing more sharply 
than expected and underlines the federal reserve must actively move 
to lower interest rates said jerry jasinowski chief economist 
for the national association of manufacturers 
were at a point now where the slowdown may get away from us 
if the fed doesnt respond soon jasinowski said 
the commerce department reported the decline in orders for both 
durable and nondurable goods to a seasonally adjusted 234 billion 
in may was the steepest falloff since orders dropped 36 percent in 
july 1988 
until recently interest rates had been rising as a result of the 
feds efforts to restrain inflation by tightening credit the may 
downturn in factory orders reflected other reports recently of a 
slowing economy 
most analysts believe that the fed is steering the economy to a 
socalled soft landing rather than a recession and there already 
have been signs it is easing its grip on credit 
i dont think that were heading for anything like a 
recession said robert brusca chief financial economist for nikko 
securities co international inc in new york i think we may have 
something like that coming our way by the end of next year but not 
for the moment 
taking exception to the softlanding theory was bruce steinberg 
of merrill lynch capital markets in new york who said the one area 
of real strength has been the industrial sector and thats really 
softening up 
i think there will be a recession the second half of the 
year he said 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last more 
than three years represented virtually all of the may decline they 
were off 45 percent to 1236 billion even worse than a 
preliminary report last week that they had fallen 42 percent 
pierre ellis senior economist for the boston co in new york 
explained that interest rates are a big factor in durable goods 
purchasing decisions 
ellis and other analysts said the slowdown could lead to more 
unemployment if manufacturers cut back production in the face of 
declining demand 
transportation equipment fell 96 percent largely because of a 
big drop in commerical aircraft orders to lead mays decline 
without the volatile transportation sector durable goods orders 
would have been off only 12 percent 
other drops in the durable area included primary metals off 13 
percent nonelectrical machinery off 33 percent and electrical 
machinery off 58 percent 
nondurable orders fell 01 percent to 1104 billion 
ellis said these orders have seen substantial inflation during 
the last several months and the decline may reflect an 
unwillingness of purchasers to pay higher prices 
mays overall decline in orders followed increases of 3 percent 
in april and 07 percent in march orders had fallen the first two 
months of the year 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 02 percent in may to a 
seasonally adjusted 2335 billion after a 26 percent increase in 
april

brawley a black girl who lied about being raped by a gang of white 
men pleaded innocent friday to tax evasion charges 
the rev al sharpton entered his plea a day after he was accused 
in a separate case of stealing 250000 from his youth organization 
it aint over til the fat guy sings the plump sharpton said 
after posting 20000 bail 
sharpton 34 who advised miss brawley throughout her yearlong 
ruse was charged with filing a false instrument filing a false 
income tax return for 1987 and for failing to file an income tax 
return for 1986 
the indictment brought about by attorney general robert abrams 
carries penalties of up to 5 years in jail and 60000 in fines 
in new york city on thursday sharpton was arrested on a 67count 
indictment for charges including fraud and grand larceny abrams 
said sharpton made personal use of money solicited for the national 
youth movement which he started as an antidrug group when he was 
16 
no date has been set for the trials that will be held in albany 
and new york city 
sharpton who is black said black people ought to file and 
then go to civil court and say we dont owe this country anything 
and thats what i intend to do 
income tax owed by blacks should be deducted from the 
reparations america owes us he said 
authorities said sharpton owed 26000 in state income taxes in 
1986 when he allegedly failed to file any return and that he evaded 
9000 in state income taxes in 1987 the first year he ever filed a 
state tax return 
the state alleges sharpton evaded state income taxes by using the 
bank accounts of the national youth movement as his personal 
accounts 
sharpton said he used the organizations funds to pay for such 
activities as antidrug programs and for the buses that transported 
people to demonstrations such as the one held in albany last year in 
support of miss brawley 
miss brawley claimed she was abducted and raped by white men she 
was found nov 28 1987 in a plastic garbage bag smeared with 
feces and with racial epithets scrawled on her body 
sharpton acted as a brawley family adviser and abrams headed the 
investigation into the girls allegations after a sevenmonth 
investigation a grand jury last year concluded miss brawley made the 
story up

housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp made a multimillion dollar commitment friday to help 
resolve a longstanding housing desegregation case in yonkers ny 
kemp would not specify the amount of federal funds involved but 
hud spokesman jack flynn stressed the secretary has clearly made 
a multimillion dollar commitment 
kemps actions include approval of construction on five sites 
of 142 new units of public housing in yonkers he said the units are 
an integral part of a federal courts plan in the yonkers litigation 
to provide lowincome and moderateincome housing open to all 
races in predominantly white sections of the city 
president bush and i are committed to fair housing and have 
made the full enforcement of laws against discrimination one of our 
top priorities for the agency said kemp in a statement our 
actions will help provide lowincome housing opportunities for those 
in need and promote our goal of fair housing for all 
yonkers mayor nicholas wasicsko explained that hud originally 
promised 12 million for the project but the amount fell short of 
the estimated 100000 cost per unit which is 20 percent higher 
than planned 
hud now has agreed to pay the difference which wasicsko 
estimated at an additional 3 million to 6 million 
wasicsko said groundbreaking for the 142 town houses is set for 
march 1990 he said the city is to pay the 83 million for the 
building sites as well as at least 20 million for new schools 
linked to the housing 
a total of about 200 housing units are planned he said 
the yonkers mayor said he had requested the money for the past 
year in letters to hud 
im hoping it will have a psychological effect to see that even 
washington is going to go the extra mile its about time yonkers 
helped itself said wasicsko 
some councilmen will be shocked and some will be pleased i 
think it shows that for the first time someone outside of yonkers is 
lending a hand to make the remedy work 
us district judge leonard b sand in 1985 found yonkers liable 
for 40 years of intentional segregation in its public housing and 
schools as part of his remedy he ordered public housing be built 
in predominantly white neighborhoods 
the desegregation plan however has met with vehement opposition 
in yonkers which flirted with bankruptcy last year when council 
members refused to endorse part of the plan and sand found them in 
contempt of court and imposed escalating fines 
kemp praised the efforts of sen daniel p moynihan dny in 
pursuing the settlement sen moynihan has long been a champion of 
equal opportunity for all people and his tenacity has been a key 
element in reaching this groundbreaking resolution

a former federal security chief on trial for 
the slaying of a prominent journalist will also be accused of 
ordering the assassination of a special government agent officials 
said friday 
special prosecutor miguel angel garcia dominguez told a news 
conference he will file additional charges against jose antonio 
zorrilla perez director of the nowdissolved federal security 
administration for the killing of special agent jose luis esqueda 
gutierrez 
zorrilla is currently on trial for the may 30 1984 slaying of 
manuel buendia whose books and frontpage column in the newspaper 
excelsior exposed wrongdoing in high places 
garcia said he has voluminous evidence zorrilla ordered 
buendia and esqueda killed because they were investigating 
zorrillas alleged links to leading drug traffickers 
the gunmen in both slayings were members of the security 
administration whose functions were roughly similar to the fbi 
until the organization was disbanded by the government in 1986 for 
widespread corruption 
buendia was shot dead at the entrance of a parking garage near 
his office garcia said the evidence shows the triggerman was juan 
rafael moro avila a playboy from a prominent family of mexican 
politicians 
moro now awaiting trial denied at his indictment that he fired 
the shots that killed buendia claiming that a police informer who 
was shot dead two years ago did it 
three other senior officers from the security administration 
including one woman also are on trial for complicity in the buendia 
slaying 
esqueda an interior department special agent assigned to 
investigate zorrillas involvement with the drug trade was killed 
on feb 16 1985 on a mexico city street with a single shot to the 
back of the neck garcia said 
alberto estrella barrera and two other security administration 
officers carried out esquedas murder garcia said he did not 
identify the other two but said they are being sought by police 
estrella was arrested and under questioning claimed zorrilla 
ordered esqueda killed he is scheduled to be arraigned on a murder 
charge before the citys 34th court sometime saturday 
zorrilla was also charged with obstruction of justice abuse of 
authority illicit enrichment and two other federal felonies drug 
trafficking and illegal possesion of firearms reserved only for 
military use 
garcia said 15 automatic rifles and pistols of unauthorized 
caliber were seized at a hideout where zorrilla was arrested 
both esqueda and buendia were longtime friends of zorrilla the 
motive for killing them was the knowledge both victims had of 
zorrillas links with the drug traffic garcia said

a judge said friday he was convinced us 
rep donald lukens is a sex offender and sentenced him to 30 days in 
jail and a 500 fine for having sex with a 16yearold girl last 
year 
this court is particularly struck by the unwillingness of the 
defendant to recognize that he was not the victim franklin county 
domestic relations judge ronald solove said adding that he could 
not excuse lukens contention that he was somehow seduced by a 
child 
you have refused to take that degree of responsibility 
solove said this court is convinced you are a sex offender 
lukens face appeared ashen as solove sentenced him to the 
maximum penalty on the misdemeanor charge of contributing to the 
unruliness of a child 180 days in jail and a 1000 fine the 
judge then suspended all but 30 days of the sentence and 500 of the 
fine and placed lukens on probation for one year 
the terms of probation require lukens to participate in sex 
offender programs and submit to testing for sexually transmitted 
diseases 
a jury may 26 convicted the middletown republican following a 
fiveday trial lukens 58 who is divorced allegedly paid rosie 
coffman of columbus 40 to have sex with him at his columbus 
apartment on nov 6 
lukens left the courtroom without commenting to reporters in a 
telephone interview from washington lukens spokesman bill 
jarrell said it was a mistake for the judge to claim lukens was not 
apologetic because its absurd for someone to expect to show 
remorse for something theyre innocent of 
lukens went free after his lawyers posted 10000 bond pending 
appeal 
ms coffman now 17 said she believed the sentence was fair 
i really hope he does go through the counseling because he 
really needs it he is sick and he really needs help just because 
hes sick with the problem he made a lot of others sick with the 
problem i am going to counseling too she said 
her mother anna coffman was in the courtroom and showed no 
expression as the sentence was read 
allegations that lukens had sex with ms coffman surfaced in 
february when columbus television station wsyx broadcast a tape of a 
nov 11 meeting between lukens and anna coffman 
lukens did not know the meeting at a local fastfood restaurant 
was being taped on the tape lukens offered to find mrs coffman a 
government job after she accused him of messing around with her 
daughter on nov 6 and four years earlier when the girl was 13 
conviction on a misdemeanor does not automatically bar lukens 
from congress but ohio republican party chairman robert bennett on 
june 1 called for lukens to resign from congress and the ohio 
republican state committee bennett vowed that lukens would not 
appear on the party ballot in 1990 
in addition the house ethics committee has been asked to 
investigate the case the ethics committee complaint was filed by 
house republican leader bob michel rill 
lukens served two terms in congress from 1967 to 1970 when he 
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the gop gubernatorial 
nomination in ohio after 15 years in the ohio senate he was 
returned to congress by voters in the western ohio district in 1986

gunmen killed a prominent 
advocate of the far right friday in the second such assassination of 
a politician this month 
witnesses said edgar chacons car was raked with submachinegun 
fire from a passing pickup truck at midafternoon as he was driving 
in the miramonte neighborhood in the northwest area of the capital 
patricia gonzalez a spokeswoman for hospital diagnostico said 
chacon 42 died in the emergency room 
no group claimed responsibility but president alfredo cristiani 
blamed the leftist guerrillas of the farbundo marti national 
liberation front also known as the fmln 
cristiani called it a cowardly act by sick minds he said 
that chacon used only ideas and his beliefs as arms he expressed 
what he thought was good and bad and this demonstrates the 
inability of the fmln to promote their cause with ideas instead of 
violence 
cristiani spoke with reporters after a ceremony at the supreme 
court 
chacon was director of the institute for international relations 
a farright think tank a vehement anticommunist he abandoned the 
rightist republican nationalist alliance also known as arena 
several years ago 
chacon accused the party in power since june 1 of going soft in 
its opposition to communism in forums and frequent appearances on 
locally broadcast programs he accused cuba and nicaragua of 
supporting el salvadors leftist guerrillas in their 9yearold 
fight for power 
he was a sponsor in may of the patriotic civil defense force of 
rightwing volunteers in the affluent san salvador neighborhood of 
escalon 
christian democratic president jose napoleon duarte dissolved the

a teenager who killed her abusive father 
was acquitted friday in a judgment that extends to juveniles the 
posttraumatic stress defense previously used in cases of battered 
wives killing husbands 
circuit judge john kuder found diana goodykoontz 15 innocent of 
seconddegree murder in the july 23 slaying of navy chief petty 
officer dennis goodykoontz at the familys home in this panhandle 
city 
he was shot to death with his own 357caliber magnum revolver 
witnesses testified during the fourday nonjury trial that the 
girl suffered from battered child syndrome a form of the 
posttraumatic stress disorder that afflicts some battleshocked 
veterans 
the judge said it caused her to have the reasonable belief she 
was in imminent danger of great bodily harm although her father 
had taken no overt physical action just before he was shot 
and she further reasonably believed that the use of deadly 
force was necessary to prevent that harm from occurring the judge 
said 
prosecutors argued that ms goodykoontz acted under the influence 
of heavymetal rock that dwells on the occult and suicide but kuder 
said evidence failed to show any connection between the music and 
the slaying 
i thought that they were just going to do something to me 
anyway cause i like the music ms goodykoontz said 
afterward its not fair to judge somebody just because of what 
they listen to 
ms goodykoontz had testified that her father made sexual 
overtures and she was afraid he was going to rape her the judge 
also heard testimony that the father had a history of violence 
against his wife and three children that was tied to drinking had 
virtually held them hostage at their home had once threatened to 
kill the entire family and himself 
goodykoontz had gotten drunk just before ms goodykoontz shot him 
and ordered the family to the living room she testified she 
believed another violent confrontation was imminent and she refused 
instead retreating to her parents bedroom where the gun was kept 
dianas testimony indicates she considered escape through the 
bedroom window but believed that the curtains and other obstacles 
would prevent it kuder said she stepped from the room into the 
hall and fired one shot into the chest of her father 
ms goodykoontz who was tried in juvenile court could have been 
placed in juvenile detention until age 19 had she been convicted 
in an adult court she would have faced up to life in prison

allegedly was involved in the deal but the diplomat left before a 
formal request was made 
the iranian spokesman said the diplomats tour of duty had ended 
more than a month ago and that he had returned to tehran according 
to irna 
sources in bonn germany identified the man as seyed karim ali 
sobhani and said he had worked for the iranian embassy there since 
september 1987 
the rheineisen revelations followed an international uproar six 
months ago over the involvement of west german companies in the 
building of a suspected poison gas factory in libya

a dying soldier of fortune accused hustler 
magazine publisher larry flynt and flynts former chief of security 
of murdering him a cotton club murder case witness testified 
thursday 
michael pascal said he visited mitchell werbell on his deathbed 
in 1983 and was told they put something in the drink 
pascal said werbell was asked who got you 
he indicated rider and flynt said the witness 
william rider the former chief of security testified last week 
against two former flynt bodyguards charged with the 1983 murder of 
new york theatrical producer roy radin rider flynts 
brotherinlaw testified that he never participated in any killings 
but the defendants did 
pascals statements came during crossexamination by defense 
attorneys who are challenging the credibility of rider a key 
prosecution witness in the case pascal was testifying at a 
preliminary hearing for three of the four people charged with 
radins murder 
municipal judge patti jo mckay however ultimately ordered most 
of pascals testimony stricken after ruling that what werbell said 
did not qualify as a dying statement because he didnt know he was 
dying such a statement would be an exception to the rules barring 
hearsay evidence 
not only are the statements inherently incredible but on their 
face they make no sense carl grumer one of flynts attorneys 
commented after the hearing 
he said werbells death certificate lists heart disease and 
congestive heart failure as the causes of death 
pascals prosecution testimony during the preliminary hearing for 
three of the four people charged with radins murder has been more 
favorable to the defense 
the fourth defendant charged in the case robert ulmer lowe was 
arraigned thursday after waiving extradition from maryland lowe 
pleaded innocent to the murders of radin and a prostitute june 
mincher and denied special circumstances which could bring him the 
death penalty if convicted 
lowes attorney mark kaiserman asked that the defendant be kept 
in a high security section of the jail saying he had been receiving 
threats 
pascal who runs a security service that provided some of the 
flynt bodyguards also testified that rider at different times 
admitted two murders solicited a third and discussed a plan to blow 
up the us capitol 
riders testimony has linked the defendants to radins death and 
implicated movie producer robert evans and reputed drug dealer karen 
delayne lanie greenberger 
radin 33 was negotiating financing of the movie the cotton 
club with evans when he disappeared on may 13 1983 after 
stepping into a limousine with mrs greenberger his bulletriddled 
body was found a month later in a dry riverbed 65 miles north of los 
angeles 
the preliminary hearing will determine whether mrs greenberger 
lowe william mentzer and alex marti stand trial evans has refused 
to testify but his lawyer has said he was not involved 
pascal said rider told him werbell was poisoned with a druglaced 
drink because he refused to train flynts people at a paramilitary 
camp werbell operated in georgia 
werbell a soldier of fortune and firearms dealer died in los 
angeles in december 1983 his family said he suffered a heart attack 
but pascal said he and a new orleans investigator gordon novell 
visited werbell in the hospital after the 65yearold werbell 
collapsed at a cocktail party at flynts house 
deputy district attorney david conn asked if werbell said 
anything else during the visit 
he named mr rider and mr flynt said pascal he asked us 
to get them flynt and rider he was talking to gordon novell 
holding his hand and he said for me get them 
pascal also claimed that rider said he killed someone in the 
mens room of the hustler bar in columbus ohio but he did not name 
the victim and he said rider solicited him to kill an fbi informant 
by throwing the man out of a 16th floor hotel room window in 
washington dc pascal said he tipped off the intended victim and 
saved his life 
outside court conn said he had no reason to believe that rider 
ever committed any murders i dont think theres any reliable 
evidence of any criminal activity by mr rider he said

welcome to sillyville where yellow 
spurtlegurgles red bittybooties blue twirlypops and green 
jingleheimers perform a gaggle of goofy kids songs 
its latest in music videos from the creators of wee sing 
songbooks coloring books and cassettes 
peewees playhouse its not and thats just fine for pam 
beall and susan nipp who began their weesing venture 12 years ago 
with an eye toward tradition 
the two former music teachers have parlayed an initial 200 
investment into a multimillion dollar kiddie publishing line based 
on traditional music in the public domain 
in 1977 beall and nipp were fumbling about for forgotten verses 
to traditional tot songs the two then mothers to four toddlers 
started looking for songbooks 
we found some very beautiful hardbound books but theyd only 
have a few of the songs we were looking for and they were just too 
expensive for young mothers beall said on the set of the pairs 
fourth video production 
beall and nipp who had given up elementary music teaching in the 
portland suburbs of lake oswego and beaverton to stay home with 
their children also were casting about for a cottage business 
they began conducting workshops for parents and teachers 
researching the words to childrens songs and finally putting them 
together in a book 
the first run of their selfpublished songbook weesing was 
a mere 500 copies selling for a modest 295 within two years wee 
publishing had sold 20000 copies 
often working nights after their children were in bed beall and 
nipp were responsible for everything from making sales calls on 
local bookstores to packaging mailing and billing 
after two years we decided it was too much said nipp we 
wanted to write more books and we just didnt have enough time 
so the women packed a suitcase full of their books left the 
children with their husbands and headed for an american booksellers 
association convention in seattle 
price stern and sloan a los angelesbased publisher took on the 
wee sing songbook giving beall and nipp time to write and 
design the next in what would become a series of nine songbooks 
with one exception each songbook features words and music to 
about 30 childrens favorites from old macdonald to little 
bunny froo froo handlettered by beall and illustrated by nancy 
klein also on each tape are one or two songs written by beall and 
nipp 
the books emphasize standard childrens songs because the women 
wish to keep tradition alive especially during a time when so much 
new childrens music is being produced 
theyre songs that are tried and true so we know theyre 
still good for kids said beall 
at their publishers urging beall 42 and nipp 43 agreed to 
market wee sing cassette tapes now a standard feature with the 
song and coloring books 
we fought the cassette tapes for a long time because our 
purpose was to get the parent or teacher to sing with the child 
then we realized that some people couldnt carry a tune or just 
wanted to listen so we consented to the tapes and its been good 
beall said 
the tapes first produced in chicago using professional singers 
have since reverted to a homespun sound using the beall and nipp 
children 
we didnt want a real annie hollywood sound said beall 
the logical choice was to use our own kids 
videos for each songbook came next 
their agreement with price stern sloan keeps all production in 
portland even though nipp moved with her family to coeur dalene 
idaho in 1979 but she and beall maintain a close partnership 
through daily phone calls and monthly visits

debt is a wonderful tool in the hands of a wise 
man but not a fool 
it allows people to live well today off tomorrows income it 
finances home ownership cars vacations educations it keeps 
economic expansions running beyond their time it permits 
politicians grandiloquently to spread the wealth 
it is creative one of the amazing discoveries of recent years 
has been that debt never needs to be repaid if the borrower fails 
to meet the terms the terms are eased and the due date extended 
with nations it can go on forever 
nothing is resolved by pushing back the due dates of course but 
it does buy time and it helps institutions save face many banks 
have pushed the third world debt problem right off the front pages 
by this expedient 
but every other day an irritating nagging question arises from 
deep in the interior of our being is the tool in the hands of wise 
men or is it being wielded by fools 
specifically is it wise to run federal budget deficits when one 
of the biggest items in the budget is to repay old debts lend money 
to nations that cannot repay finance students who use their 
education to evade collection 
every day another aspect of bad debt is presented for public 
consideration 
savings and loan associations lent billions on frivolous projects 
and now to save the financial system must be bailed out by 
taxpayers some of the loans were fraudulent some were made in good 
faith by fools 
home lenders eased their mortgage terms by such devices as not 
verifying income offering greatly reduced comeon rates for the 
first year only and agreeing to base the loan on two incomes while 
observing that the wife was pregnant 
corporate raiders and merger artists learned that all it takes to 
command a banks billions is to make it an offer it cannot afford to 
turn down even when the bank knows the borrower is going to be 
suffocated in highcost debt 
and the other side of the same picture companies threatened by 
takeover have learned that the best defense is to buy off current 
shareholders with a big dividend and then go deep into debt to scare 
off the raider 
and still another aspect of the same scene corporate lenders 
devised junk bonds or highrisk highyield loans to finance 
hundreds of companies some of which barely have earnings to repay 
the finance charges 
in 1978 less than 2 billion of these bonds were out there now 
there may be as much as 180 billion of them outstanding most 
issued in the past three or four years 
they are expensive to the issuing company which in many 
instances is a company that has trouble making enough money to pay 
the interest but interest is just part of the problem the 
principal must be repaid too 
in many instances the assumption is made that the company often 
a weak one will be so nourished by the infusion of money that it 
will build itself up like a football player trample its competition 
and earn big money 
risky of course but junk bonds have a following mainly because 
of the great returns to the lender the same return that may 
threaten the survival of the borrower at 126 percent a bond 
returns in interest its original cost 
those who buy them are said to be among the wisest and prudent 
professional investors in the world mutual funds and insurance 
companies each own about 30 percent of them pensions funds 15 
percent and savings and loans 8 percent 
wise men or fools its hard to say right now the ultimate junk 
bond scenario might not unfold until the late 1990s when some 
borrowers are due to be redeeming or perhaps defaulting on their 
notes 
but the question pervades the entire borrowing and lending scene 
and like the loans themselves there seems to be great reluctance 
in facing the realities 
home mortgage defaults are rising for example and the veterans 
mortgage plan might be in trouble still congress is considering 
legislation to permit eligible veterans to buy homes costing up to 
184000 with no down payment 
wise or foolish is the tool being used to dig a hole that 
undermines the economy wise men seem to shy from the question and 
by so doing reveal that they too might be buying time and hoping for 
the best

sixteen years ago bunny wailer peter tosh and 
robert marley released catch a fire the album catapulted the 
reggae trio to international fame 
a world tour followed but wailer who is more at home in the 
hills of his native jamaica than the concert stage returned home 
and vowed never to go on the road again 
the mystical mountain man busied himself writing and recording 
songs on his own label solomonic and farmed the land at the same 
time 
i think i love the country actually a little bit more than the 
city wailer said it has more to do with life health and 
strength the city takes that away sometimes the country is good 
for meditation it has fresh food and fresh atmosphere that keeps 
you going 
this year he launched a tour to support his liberation lp 
which took him to 13 cities in the united states 
his recent performance at radio city music hall with the switch 
dance troupe marked his first new york appearance since selling out 
madison square garden in a solo concert nearly three years ago 
wailer was born neville oreilly livingston 42 years ago his 
career began in 1963 in a kingston jamaica slum when he and his 
childhood friend robert nesta marley teamed with winston hubert 
mcintosh later to be known as peter tosh to form the legendary 
group the wailers 
after the release of their first hit simmer down in 1964 
the wailers popularity spread throughout jamaica by 1966 they had 
five records in the jamaican top 10 but the pulsating sound of 
reggae went largely unnoticed by the rest of the world until the 
catch a fire lp 
on their first tour they met thunderous applause as audiences 
throughout the world jammed stadiums packed concert and theater 
stages and lined dance halls to catch a glimpse of those natty 
dreadlocks from jamaica 
while marley and tosh lost no time blazing international trails 
for themselves wailer headed for the jamaican countryside to be 
close to nature 
marley whose i shot the sheriff was covered by such rockers 
as eric clapton and who had become the biggest of the reggae stars 
died of a brain tumor at the age of 36 in 1981 
tosh who left the wailers in 1973 and formed his own group 
word sound and power was nominated for a grammy for the lp 
captured live in 1985 he was gunned down and killed in his 
jamaican home on sept 11 1987 at the age of 42 
marley and the wailers did more to popularize and refine reggae 
than any other artists they had hits with stir it up get up 
stand up no woman no cry and could you be loved 
bunny wailer considers himself just as much a farmer as a 
musician and helped provide food for victims of hurricane gilbert 
last fall 
sometimes people pay less attention to those things food but 
they turn out to be the most important things i am a farmer said 
wailer who was in the united states when the hurricane smashed into 
the caribbean island 
wailer chartered a jet filled it with food and flew to jamaica 
when wailer returned to his farm on the border of portland and st 
thomas parishes he found his home undamaged 
liberation his fourth album on the shanachi label includes 
messages on hunger drug abuse apartheid and freedom the lp also 
contains a copy of the universal declaration of human rights 
based on the history it projects its taken 400 years to 
write wailer said in an interview when i said i was going into 
the studio that only took four months but to get all these things 
together it has taken my lifetime and so many other lifetimes 
before 
wailer was joined on portions of the liberation tour by 
toshs son andrew and the grammywinning ziggy marley bob 
marleys son

when a network wants to give you a primetime 
show aimless wandering is probably not the best concept to try 
to sell to them 
but if his sitcomslashstandup show the seinfeld chronicles 
does well enough on wednesday to become a midseason replacement on 
nbc thats what comedian jerry seinfeld hopes it will evolve into 
the seinfeld chronicles has a great cast smart writing and 
an unusual format intercutting a sitcom with seinfelds standup 
comedy act seinfeld is basically playing himself a standup 
comedian named jerry who is a bachelor 
seinfeld and cowriter larry david also a standup comic came 
up with the idea over a couple of cups of coffee on eighth avenue 
one night 
i said nbc is interested in doing some kind of show with me 
and i dont have any ideas we figured why not just do a show about 
how comedians live and how they work and how it happens 
a lot of the show is very much like seinfelds own life he 
said from los angeles i mean it was easy for me to do it im 
really not acting watching tv and sitting in a coffee shop thats 
what comedians do 
with the time spent on jerrys standup routine a halfhour isnt 
much time to tell much of a story which is why seinfeld would just 
as soon dispense with a plotline i want to have a show of aimless 
wandering through life but we figure thats a good way to get 
audiences interested in the beginning i mean it will always be 
some sort of progression of events but we want to structure it very 
loosely 
if they pick it up its going to progress in a different 
direction from that show its going to be much more an interior 
monologue that would show what seinfeld is thinking and how he 
incorporates everyday experiences into a comedy routine 
david who was a writerperformer on abcs fridays and a 
writer on saturday night live does a standup act that seems to 
be so personal it can be almost painful to watch pair him with the 
more mainstream seinfeld and the result is an honest warm and 
amusing examination of life in the late 80s 
jason alexander who won a tony award as best actor in a musical 
for jerome robbins broadway plays george jerrys neurotic 
manager another fridays veteran michael richard who more 
recently starred in the syndicated marblehead manor plays 
seinfelds oddball neighbor hoffman 
in the pilot jerry has met a woman on the road who is coming to 
new york to visit does she want to sleep with him or not george 
puts him through an angstwringing analysis of her possible motives 
jerry observing decorum obtains a spare bed for the visitor 
george is stricken i cant believe youre bringing in an extra 
bed for a woman who wants to sleep with you why dont you bring in 
an extra guy too 
hoffman shows up to borrow meat and stays to complain about 
the mets loss spoiling the game for jerry who had taped it and 
avoided human contact all day so he could watch it in suspense 
viewers of the tonight show and late night have probably 
seen much of seinfelds act but prime time will give his 
alwaysfunny material a wider audience 
a scene in a laundromat prompts his laundry routine jerry 
believes the washing machine is the clothes nightclub he thinks 
that we return from the laundromat with one missing sock because in 
the hamper the night before it plotted its escape 
after his rendezvous with ms wonderful turns sour jerry 
analyzes romance women know what men want men know what men 
want what do men want women

in an experiment at fitting the punishment to the 
criminal as well as the crime maricopa county judges are preparing 
to borrow from their european counterparts by imposing fines tied to 
an offenders daily income 
we think over the next 10 years as counties and states 
struggle with jail overcrowding the fine will become a more and 
more attractive option for judges said judith greene of the vera 
institute of justice which is running the test of day fines for 
nonviolent felonies that starts in december 
even with such alternatives as community service and home 
detention she said the number of inmates has doubled in the last 
10 years 
day fines were first tried in finland in 1921 and are widely 
used in western europe courts in sweden england and west germany 
impose fines as the sole penalty in 80 percent to 85 percent of all 
convictions ms greene said 
by contrast judges in the united states tend to impose fines 
below the statutory limits in the interest of consistency which 
reduces their deterrent effect and penalizes defendants with lower 
incomes she said 
the word afterthought is used said b michael dann 
presiding judge of the countys superior court the thinking is 
that too many judges think of the fine after the other penalties and 
think ill just tack this on you can pay 500 that kind of 
attitude 
among the purposes of the study is to help come up with a 
system of meansbased fines tied both to the severity of the offense 
and the defendants ability or anticipated ability to pay 
thereby impacting the wealthy and the neerdowell forger in 
roughly the same way 
maricopa countys will be the first us court to test the idea 
for felonies in a test in misdemeanor cases last year in richmond 
county on new yorks staten island day fines for theft ranged from 
25 for a welfare mother to nearly 4000 for someone with annual 
income of more than 35000 
the fines are a perfect vehicle for restitution federal judges 
frequently turn over fines to victims and they safeguard 
defendants rights because of a twostep process in setting the 
amounts ms greene said 
first the judge sentences an offender to a certain number of 
fine units based on the severity of the offense but regardless 
of income the next step is assigning a value to each fine unit as a 
share of the defendants daily income the judge then multiplies 
that value by the number of fine units 
day fines would work best in local jurisdictions where the 
individual most likely has a steady job and will continue to work in 
the community said jeffrey washington of the american 
correctional association in laurel md 
on the federal level offenders might be more likely to skip out 
on the fine and the problems would start with the question of who 
would collect he said youve got the bureau of prisons the us 
sentencing commission the us treasury or would you create 
another branch of government 
the new yorkbased vera institute a privately funded 
organization credited for research that persuaded congress to enact 
a bailreform law in 1966 picked maricopa county superior court 
because of its reputation 
the court has been a leader nationally in the development 
of techniques for speeding case processing and controlling 
disposition time ms greene said it also has been a site for 
experiments bail guidelines for one and currently is involved in 
an experiment with urine surveillance of criminal offenders 
arizona has strong mandatorysentencing laws but legislators 
said they shouldnt conflict with the day fines incarceration is 
our most expensive response and we should avoid it except where 
absolutely necessary said democrat state sen jones osborne a 
member of the senate judicial committee 
planners have begun an eightmonth study of 20 criminal judges in 
maricopa county and of a sentencing structure based on fines ms 
greene said the first fines will be imposed in december 
dann said he couldnt order judges to participate but would 
encourage them to do so arizona law sets a general limit of 
150000 in fines on all classes of felonies giving his judges 
plenty of latitude for the experiment 
whitecollar crimes would be a likely offense to be punished by 
day fines he said even if its lowlevel violence something 
nonrepetitive that might qualify it depends on the level or type 
assault in a barroom and those still occur in the wild west 
can for these purposes be treated differently from a mugging or an 
assault on the street or sexual assault 
steve twist an assistant state attorney general said day fines 
might have possibilities if they were strictly limited to 
nonviolent offenders and if restitution to victims had first call 
on the money collected 
i would be cautious that they not just look at what the 
person was convicted of he said in a plea bargain a person 
actually could commit an armed robbery but be convicted of theft 
on the other side of the courtroom harold higgins who resigned 
in june as chief public defender in pima county said he liked the 
idea of keeping nonviolent offenders out of jail 
i think were sending way too many people to prison that dont 
need to go to prison higgins said fining might be viable so 
long as its not used to discriminate against people who cant 
afford to buy into it 
so with that one caveat it sounds like a good deal

a new breed of filmmakers is leaving a 
deep imprint on west german consciousness with movies about turks 
trapped between the ways of their new german homeland and 
traditional customs of their own kin 
right now these movies are in the vanguard of german films 
they are among the best in the whole country said frank gethke 
deputy head of the german film and television academy in west berlin 
critics are mesmerized by the new films portraying the struggles 
of turks in a modern and sometimes unfriendly western society 
one of the new movies yasemin by german director hark bohm 
won top prize at the prestigious german film awards in west berlin 
another movie tevfik basers abschied vom falschen paradies 
farewell to a false paradise was among the nations top 10 
films baser is turkishborn and is building a reputation as one of 
west germanys leading film directors 
turks are west germanys largest foreign minority numbering more 
than 15 million they are often targets of intense resentment by 
many natives who see them as unfair competition for scarce jobs and 
housing 
the latest films by bohm and baser try to bridge a sizeable 
cultural gap 
these films aim to improve germans understanding about the 
turkish minority living among them and i think they succeed 
gethke said 
basers and bohms films portray young turkish people not only 
isolated within western culture but also under intense pressure 
from their conservative families to be wary of western ideals 
in bohms film a young hamburg man falls in love with a 
progressiveminded turkish girl yasemin but the relationship is an 
impossible one because of her familys strong resistance 
baser first impressed critics three years ago with 40 m2 
deutschland 40 square meters of germany a fictional movie 
about a woman named turna locked up by her strict husband in a seedy 
hamburg apartment after they arrived in west germany from turkey 
the germanlanguage film takes its name from the minuscule size of 
the couples new home 
turna revolts against her husbands efforts to isolate her from 
western ways but fails to find freedom even after he dies during an 
epileptic fit the desperate woman suddenly faces a culture in which 
she cannot even understand what her neighbors are saying and is 
left completely without friends 
baser tracks similar themes in farewell to a false paradise 
based on the true story about a young turkish woman who is sent to 
jail for killing her turkish husband after he brutalizes her she 
finds happiness behind prison walls totally casting off her 
familys maledominated customs 
but in the end she is to be deported after her release from the 
false paradise of prison and she contemplates killing herself 
rather than having to return to a homeland which she now considers 
completely foreign 
farewell to a false paradise launched the turkishborn 
actress zuhal olcay into sudden stardom in west germany and she won 
best actress honors at the german film awards

german filmgoers get action and 
adventure from directors like steven spielberg most of their laughs 
from the likes of mel brooks and doses of irony and social 
commentary from the works of woody allen 
throughout the four decades since an independent film industry 
was reestablished in west germany american film has dominated the 
market pushing german movies to the fringes 
american films have accounted for at least eight of the top 10 
boxoffice draws this year vacating a rung only occasionally for 
german successes such as joseph vilsmaiers herbstmilch or xaver 
schwarzenbergers with the next man everything will be different 
we dont try to compete with hollywood said bernhard kock a 
film historian and spokesman for west germanys largest studio 
bavaria film american films always have been the major boxoffice 
successes here and that situation is unlikely to change 
rather than aiming for the general audiences who love american 
comedies and dramas german filmmakers have concentrated on a 
unique artistic and often avantgarde genre 
its difficult to say what makes a film german but there is a 
certain something a weight that they carry kock observed 
a handful of young filmmakers have made some recent forays into 
more conventional subjects with relative success helping to boost 
the share of theater tickets sold for german films to a postwar 
high of nearly 20 percent 
but in a market that has fallen from 800 million tickets a year 
in the bleak years after world war ii to about 100 million in the 
age of video and vast new entertainment options german film is 
anything but a growth industry 
director doris doerrie whose 1986 satire men was one of 
the few german boxoffice smashes of the decade says the 
unconventional thread running through many west german films is an 
outgrowth of the complicated subsidy system that keeps the industry 
alive 
filmmakers are a lot more likely to get grants for artistic 
productions and once you get the money there is no pressure for 
commercial success she said in a recent interview 
while that easing of financial and marketing worries allows a 
freer atmosphere for the filmmaker it poses little incentive for 
directors to aim for audiences seeking entertainment over artistic 
value 
government subsidies have backed the west german industry since 
it was allowed to reorganize in the late 1940s during the postwar 
allied occupation 
germany has a rich film legacy dating back to the expressionism 
of 191930 which produced such landmarks as the cabinet of dr 
caligari nosferatu and metropolis 
in the first years after the nazi defeat american occupiers 
imported hollywood movies using them to promote development of a 
democratic society according to film historian thomas guback in his 
book the international film industry this helped establish 
hollywoods grip on the german market 
all german films made prior to 1945 were seized and kept out of 
circulation while the military governments encouraged by hollywood 
lobbyists to take their time slowly returned those deemed free of 
nazi propaganda to the theaters 
what also played a role was the financial attractiveness for 
the allies to block rebuilding of the german film industry and keep 
the market open for their own films said film historian isa van 
eeghen 
recovery has been slow and despite west germanys economic 
prosperity filmmaking requires government and television revenues 
to keep production at about 60 new films per year half the number 
released during the late 50s 
some of the most successful contemporary films by west german 
directors have been coproduced with american and other foreign 
companies resulting in a multinational hybrid art form that is 
beginning to characterize european cinema 
a number of german directors have moved their entire operations 
to los angeles including wolfgang petersen whose 1981 submarine 
drama das boot was the most successful west german film ever 
marketed abroad 
but some german filmmakers have found their styles to be 
incompatible with the more rigid and profitoriented american system 
wim wenders and volker schloendorff have recently returned to 
west germany after hollywood successes with their productions 
respectively of paris texas and death of a salesman 
wenders complained in a recent interview with the bonn daily die 
welt that hollywood is too controlled stifling the creativity 
and spontaneity he considers crucial to good directing 
producers want to know everything about the film they are 
responsible for he said films are designed in hollywood like 
cars are built in detroit everything has to be worked out 
beforehand 
while the flow of talent between the united states and europe has 
diluted the earnest tone that was unique to german film in the 60s 
and 70s directors working on both sides of the atlantic contend 
the exchange is enriching 
i grew up watching american films but i never understood the 
whole process behind them until i worked in the united states 
said doerrie whose 1988 film me and him was produced by 
columbia pictures i dont think my work can be described as 
entirely german

arne elsholtz looks nothing like tom hanks and 
its hard to mistake helmut krauss for mister ed 
though their faces may be unfamiliar their voices are wellknown 
to millions of german tv and movie fans elsholtz and krauss are 
among scores of actors in west germanys dubbing industry which for 
40 years has been putting german words into the mouths of american 
stars from mickey mouse to tom cruise 
in his 20year career arne elsholtz has been tom hanks in 
splash kevin kline in a fish called wanda and bill murray 
in ghostbusters he has translated and directed scores of other 
dubbing projects at west berlins renowned berliner synchron studios 
i dont think of myself as being like tom hanks but i do like 
to have fun and thats important for dubbing a funny american movie 
like splash said the 47yearold elsholtz 
krauss who also has a contract with berliner synchron is the 
german voice of mister ed the talking horse in the popular 1950s 
american tv series 
american fans might lift an eyebrow to hear the garrulous horse 
uttering a cheerful guten tag wilbur instead of hiya 
wilbur but its the job of the dubbers to make a production 
understandable to germans 
every evening millions of germans cozy up to their tv sets to 
watch some of their favorite german programs but some of the most 
popular shows are american imports like dallas the bill cosby 
show and dynasty all dubbed 
american films are also immensely popular among germans 
hollywood movies often dominate film listings in west german tv 
program guides as well 
why the fascination with hollywood movies and sometimes ancient 
american television series 
its pretty much a money matter combined with the vast 
availability of american video entertainment said joachim kuester 
head of berliner synchron the german television networks have 
hours to be filled and it is too expensive to produce much stuff 
so they fill it up with american productions 
kuester said it is far less expensive to dub an american film or 
television program under contract with its us owners than to make 
one from scratch 
however he concedes dubbing over the distinctive voices of woody 
allen groucho marx robin williams and other actors alters the 
characters original qualities but the option subtitles could 
cause a popular uprising 
our audiences wont accept subtitles he said its more 
relaxing to sit there and listen to the movie in german

though it has been hard to see until very 
recently in the behavior of the overall stock market investors have 
been hedging their bets for some time now against the possibility of 
a recession 
that conclusion emerges from the relatively weak showing through 
the first half of 1989 by the auto steel and other stock groups 
that are traditionally regarded as most sensitive to the ups and 
downs of the economy 
in a compilation of all major stock groups from the start of the 
year through late june by standard amp poors corp such 
cyclicals dominated the list of the weakest performers 
over a span in which the broad market averages posted gains of 15 
to 20 percent the sampp auto group index dropped 2 percent and steels 
eked out a 2 percent gain 
it sure doesnt feel like a soft landing in detroit 
observed edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities 
inc in a recent commentary on the state of the auto industry 
yardeni noted that auto sales have been lagging behind the number 
of cars built in recent months prompting production cutbacks that 
include a big planned drop this month 
we still dont expect an economywide hard landing said 
yardeni but we will be watching developments in the auto industry 
with a great deal of interest autos are still a big chunk of the 
economy 
also among the firsthalf laggards in sampps tabulation were paper 
containers up 41 percent metal and glass containers up 24 
percent truckers down 77 percent and miscellaneous 
transportation down 21 percent 
demand for containers and volume of shipping are traditionally 
linked very closely to the pace of the economy 
if enthusiasm for the business outlook wasnt so hot what 
accounted for the solid gains racked up by the market as a whole in 
the first half 
for one thing falling interest rates which lit a fire under 
such interestrate sensitive groups as homebuilding up 489 
percent and savings and loans which climbed 372 percent despite 
muchpublicized problems in the thrift industry 
in addition there was the continued bubbling pot of takeover 
news and rumors which made star performers out of such disparate 
stocks as time inc sea containers ltd nwa inc and gordon 
jewelry 
the runup in nwa parent of northwest airlines along with 
speculation about possible bids for other carriers helped propel 
the sampp airline index to a 454 percent gain 
the strongest group of all entertainment companies up 497 
percent had the benefit not only of the merger frenzy but also of 
boxoffice records as several summer movies opened to great fanfare 
in the waning weeks of the second quarter 
while investors reached midyear in a cautious mood about the 
corporate earnings outlook there were still some standout stocks 
that benefited from impressive profit gains in the first half 
for example la gear the latest wall street favorite in the 
athletic footwear race soared from the low 20s to the high 50s 
for a gain of more than 160 percent 
the company posted a neartripling of profits for the fiscal 
quarter ended may 31 and reported that its order backlogs were still 
rising 
shares of federal national mortgage association playing an 
increasingly profitable role in the growing business of buying 
packaging and reselling mortgages racked up a gain of nearly 80 
percent to around 90 
for risktakers there were even better ways than fannie maes 
common stock to profit from the companys prosperity 
fannie mae warrants securities that give their holders the right 
to buy the stock at 4425 a share shot up more than 250 percent to 
rank as the single biggest firsthalf winner among new york stock 
exchange issues

when thomas wolfe died suddenly in 1938 
he left behind a 10000page mishmash of a manuscript that 
eventually wound up divided in three and served up as his last works 
literary scholars have debated for years whether the web and 
the rock and you cant go home again really are wolfes work 
they and a subsequent volume of short stories were carved from a 
trunkful of jumbled pages 
its a literary crime said john halberstadt a wolfe fan and 
literature scholar he was shocked when he learned through research 
that his favorite authors last works had been extensively rewritten 
by an editor at harper amp brothers now harper amp row 
halberstadt spent the better part of the 1970s at harvard 
universitys manuscript library tracking and cataloging changes the 
editor edward aswell made he based his yale university doctoral 
dissertation on his findings 
in his paper the making of thomas wolfes posthumous works 
halberstadt charged that in patching together the works aswell 
scrambled sequences reordered chapters made deep cuts added his 
own words and in some cases blended separate characters into one 
his allegations reignited a controversy that had flared 
intermittently since 1962 when richard s kennedy a temple 
university professor published a similar study once again the 
provenance of wolfes work was being called into question and the 
wolfean establishment was again choosing sides 
wolfes hometown paper the asheville nc citizen in a banner 
headline in the early 1980s asked thomas wolfe who wrote the 
last books 
rwb lewis a pulitzer prizewinning professor at yale and an 
adviser to halberstadt wrote in his report on the dissertation 
in years past i have often taught the web and the rock in 
american literature courses after reading halberstadt i would not 
dream of doing so again it would be teaching an unacknowledged and 
profoundly misleading hybrid 
the literary world has been aware of aswells impact for years 
and it is generally accepted that he did the best he could with what 
he had kennedy said in an interview from his pennsylvania home 
but halberstadt says the works are fraudulent and should include 
a clear note explaining the heavyhanded editing when he tried 
to publish his thesis and make his charges public he says he was 
denied the right by paul gitlin the executor of wolfes estate 
so he decided to publish an article based on his research in the 
yale reviews autumn 1980 issue without the requisite permission 
from the manuscript library and copyright owner of the papers that 
got him banned from harvards houghton library where the worlds 
largest wolfe collection is housed 
neither the wolfean establishment nor the executor of the 
authors literary estate looked kindly on halberstadts approach 
but he says his campaign to have the full manuscript published 
commercially so doubters can see for themselves aswells impact on 
the novels has been gaining steam 
last month he was permitted to give a lecture on his theories 
during the thomas wolfe societys annual meeting in cambridge 
halberstadt said he had applied repeatedly over the last decade and 
took this years nod as a sign that he was coming back into the 
groups good graces 
gitlin who has been executor of wolfes papers for more than 20 
years says his opinion of halberstadt has not changedhes not a 
scholar hes a publicity hound gitlin said in a telephone 
interview from new york 
he said it was generally accepted that aswell had the approval of 
thenexecutor and literary agent maxwell perkins there have been 
accusations of skulduggery and that aswell rewrote the book i think 
the editor did the best he could he was very brave to take on 
that manuscript 
kennedy agreed with gitlin that the world is pretty grateful 
that aswell managed to get this material into print it constitutes 
about half of wolfes published career 
gitlin and editors at harper amp row said they had never received a 
bid to publish the entire 10000page typescript and kennedy said 
there were simple reasons it would have been extremely costly 
unreadable and incoherent 
halberstadt claims northeastern university his former employer 
proposed several years ago to publish the manuscript along with his 
dissertation he says they were denied but gitlin said the rebuff 
was based on the particular scholar involved and not the issue 
if richard kennedy approached me and said he would like to do 
the original manuscript with footnotes and even if he wanted to 
attack aswell it wouldnt bother me at all the executor said 
hes a fine scholar 
halberstadt says the lonely fight will go on 
were talking here about the readers right to know about the 
secret profession of editing he said i dont think anyone has 
the right to fulfill an authors intentions on a scale unprecedented 
in american literature

the young womans enthusiasm was 
contagious i did it i did it she said smiling broadly and 
barely standing still after casting her first vote in a democratic 
election 
the right to vote is taken for granted and often ignored in 
countries with a longer tradition of rule by and for the people 
but in eastern europe brutalized by 50 years of war stalinism 
police repression false propaganda and economic mismanagement that 
simple act in the polish national elections june 4 seemed nothing 
short of a miracle 
communist rule came to eastern europe as the result of the world 
war ii military might of the soviet union but perestroika and 
glasnost under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are giving 
countries that used to be referred to as satellites the leeway 
to experiment with democracy 
economic pressures are also helping the cause of political 
reforms 
with communist economies proven unable to compete with the west 
in a hightechnology age the ideological rationale for 
marxismleninism that it makes life better for the common man and 
woman has been stripped away 
in the course of one or two years the concept of free 
competition among different political parties has gone from being an 
unimaginable dream to being hoped for and even counted on in poland 
and hungary 
poles and hungarians will even get a rare firsthand look at the 
leader of a western democracy this month when president bush stops 
to visit prior to the annual summit of industrialized democracies in 
paris 
bush will find a poland that has just held the first democratic 
parliamentary elections since world war ii in which candidates 
backed by the solidarity movement took 99 of the 100 seats 
the elections to the sejm were not free the opposition was 
allowed only to run for 35 percent of the seats solidarity took all 
161 of those its platform remove the partys leading role and 
hold free elections in four years 
in hungary that might be too slow a commission is working to 
draft a constitution expected to provide for fully free multiparty 
elections as early as next year it also will guarantee free speech 
independent courts and other human rights 
the rapid pace of democratic change in hungary was underlined by 
the reburial with honors june 16 of imre nagy leader of the 1956 
antisoviet revolt who was executed for treason hundreds of 
thousands of people were on hand for the ceremony and joined a 
veteran of 1956 in swearing we will never again be slaves 
party leaders in poland and hungary have been quoted as saying 
they hope the communist party will win planned free elections in the 
future but if not the party will accept the voters verdict and 
relinquish power 
in poland the opposition is led by lech walesa and the 
solidarity movement which embraces workers intellectuals and much 
of the powerful roman catholic church in hungary reform is mainly 
the work of intellectuals including a potent liberal wing of the 
communist party itself 
both countries already have seen the spontaneous reformation of 
longbanned political parties and associations as if they only were 
in suspended animation for the past half century there also are 
totally new political grouping such as environmentally conscious 
greens 
elsewhere in eastern europe democratization is not so advanced 
where it exists at all what is happening in poland and hungary has 
raised hopes among some citizens while disquieting the mostly aging 
leaderships 
east germany and romania the most hardline states have 
commented with dismay on hungarys move toward democracy under 
the flag of renewing socialism forces are at work that strive for 
removing socialism said east german politburo member joachim 
herrman romania said the ceremonies to honor nagy were clearly 
fascist antisocialist in nature 
both countries brook no dissent in romania dissidents are 
jailed while in east germany they are likely to find themselves 
deported to the west 
in prague the czechoslovak leadership has paid enthusiastic lip 
service to the kremlin reforms but failed so far to implement them 
amid an ongoing if secretive debate about whether change is needed 
in bulgaria leader todor zhivkov remains true to a lifetime of 
skillfully aping whatever policy holds sway in moscow in july 1987 
he embraced economic reform exciting bulgarias intelligentsia and 
younger technocrats 
but zhivkov and longtime comrades on the ruling poltiburo blocked 
dissent within the party last year dissident groups the first seen 
in four decades of communist rule are closely watched by security 
forces and troublemakers are expelled 
in yugoslavia the communist party leadership in slovenia the 
most economically advanced of the countrys six republics has 
tolerated a broad degree of pluralism while rejecting demands for 
multiparty democracy from mushrooming independent groups those 
calls have been echoed by intellectuals in croatia and servia the 
two largest republics but ethnic tensions among the republics have 
complicated any broad alliance for reform 
serbian president slobodan milosevic however uses authoritarian 
tactics and insists on oneparty orthodox communist rule putting 
him at odds with other republics particularly the slovenes who 
are now threatening secession if conflicts go unresolved

the kremlins influence here isnt limited 
to the troops in the street poland also has soviet television 
cars books and newspapers and mandatory russian language lessons 
through high school 
a changing political climate in poland and hungary where 
president bush will visit next week has emboldened citizens of the 
two countries in recent years to openly express longsilenced 
resentment of the soviet presence 
at the reburial ceremony in budapest on june 16 for imre nagy 
leader of the 1956 revolt viktor orban of the independent youth 
group fidesz drew loud applause when he advised if we muster 
enough courage then we can put an end to communist dictatorship 
and we can make sure that the immediate withdrawal of soviet troops 
is begun 
and in the southern polish city of krakow marches by young 
people chanting sowiecki do domu soviets go home have 
become regular events the youth often try to march on the citys 
soviet consulate and once vandalized a monument to red army war 
dead prompting an apology to the soviet ambassador by prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
the red army is officially on hand to defend the warsaw pact 
countries from a nato invasion but many poles and hungarians regard 
it as little more than an occupation force to guarantee continued 
communist rule it was soviet troops who put down hungarys 
anticommunist revolt in 1956 and led the warsaw pact forces who 
toppled czechoslovakias reform government in 1968 
in recent weeks the red army started withdrawing 50000 troops 
from east germany hungary poland and czechoslovakia in a pullback 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced in december as 
part of plans to cut the soviet army by 500000 troops by 1991 
the announced cutbacks which are to include 5000 tanks affect 
about 10 percent of soviet forces in eastern europe though welcomed 
almost universally the cuts have not quenched popular sentiment for 
even more 
the soviet presence in poland is not limited to the troops 
one of three tv stations in warsaw is relayed via satellite from 
moscow soviet television also can be seen in the wroclawlegnica 
area where soviet troops are concentrated but the soviet channel 
is not widely watched because of the antipathy many poles feel 
toward the soviet union and the fact that many do not understand 
russian despite the school requirements 
soviet lada cars are popular in poland and are considered by many 
residents to be superior to polishmade fiats and polonezes they 
are mainly purchased with hard currency through state dollar shops 
or private importing agencies 
soviet bookstores are in most major cities and pravda is widely 
available 
towering over central warsaw is the monolithic palace of culture 
and science a much mutteredabout gift from josef stalins soviet 
union an ofttold joke in poland says the best view of warsaw is 
from the top of the palace of culture because that is the only place 
from which one cant see the palace of culture 
most poles rarely see the estimated 40000 soviet troops among 
them the units remain secluded in tree and fencesurrounded bases 
away from towns they are rarely mentioned in the press or state 
broadcasts except in the case of the occasional military accident 
that has to be explained 
only in a few places like legnica the site of soviet military 
headquarters 260 miles southwest of warsaw is it common to see 
young russian or asian soldiers on the street 
hungarians do not hide their dislike of the troops a hotel 
waiter in esztergom near the czechoslovak border when asked by 
western diners about the helicopter noise outside answered with 
disdain and a deprecating gesture the soviets hungarian 
officials have long insisted that their country be included in the 
first phase of any withdrawal 
in poland there is a long antagonism toward the soviet union 
the countries warred in 1920 soviet troops occupied eastern 
poland in 1939 two weeks after nazis invaded from the west and over 
the next decade hundreds of thousands of poles were deported to the 
soviet union many thousands died including 4200 polish officers 
executed at katyn 
only recently has it become possible for poles to speak openly 
about this painful past after decades of propaganda proclaiming 
unblemished friendship between the polish and soviet people 
but whenever antisoviet feelings threaten to become too shrill 
leaders in poland and hungary hasten to point out that the 
transformations under way in their countries depend on gorbachevs 
reforms at home 
political reforms under way in the soviet union are 
indispenable international conditions for the success of endeavors 
for democratic socialism hungarian premier miklos nemeth 
emphasized in a june interview 
hungarian officials have flirted publicly with the idea of a 
neutral hungary someday but only if both military blocs were 
dissolved 
in poland some opposition pragmatists state a need for a defense 
alliance with the soviet union even if poland becomes totally 
democratic 
despite resentment of the soviet military presence gorbachev and 
his reform program are popular here leading figures in the 
independent solidarity movement have led the cheering for 
perestroika and have come back from moscow with enthusiastic 
accounts of its progress 
but many people still ask will it last 
the american people think that gorbachev can change a lot but 
we know the soviet union so much better said one architecture

at budapests deli station a cluster of 
old people many in wellcut clothes grown shabby with wear 
welcomes the train from vienna each morning 
they clutch signs written in german offering rooms for rent 
as pensioners surviving on as little as 60 a month they need 
cash from tourists who will pay perhaps even in coveted hard 
currency for a bed 
a warsaw housewife maria knows a retired professor who lives on 
a monthly pension of less than 25 
she has to sell everything she has in order to live says 
maria who asked that her last name not be used clothes 
ceramics everything 
the pensioners are some of the millions of people failed by 40 
years of stalinism in eastern europe 
after world war ii many on a continent ruined by fascism looked 
to socialism for peace and prosperity soviet communism seemed full 
of promise jobs free education and health care and equality in 
societies where a small caste of rich had long dominated the 
numerous poor 
communism forced heavy industry on traditionally agrarian areas 
while the bourgeois capitalists who could have managed the new 
factories were stripped of their property and jailed or deported in 
the purges of the 1950s 
shoddy buildings sprouted in the name of progress or in place of 
historic cities bombed in world war ii a drab sameness descended on 
half a continent 
today there is unparalleled pollution outmoded factories 
struggling agriculture and a 10year wait for a car or drafty 
tworoom apartment 
beginning in the mid1960s when moscow granted some leeway 
eastern europes economists tried to right wrongs but 
czechoslovakia the worlds 10th wealthiest nation before world war 
ii had its attempts crushed in a 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
hungary and poland were more fortunate by the early 1970s 
partial economic reforms praised by the western bankers who helped 
finance them seemed to put both en route to modernity and consumer 
plenty 
almost two decades later the poles hungarians and westerners to 
whom the two nations owe a total 54 billion know they were wrong to 
expect miracles from economies that were managed by corrupt 
inefficent systems dominated by one party 
now that moscow is permitting the political change it once 
forbade the economic decay and falling living standards in hungary 
and poland are two motors for reform 
politicians eager to satisfy their citizens craving for western 
consumer goods are permitting more travel and private imports of 
videos and other wonders they cannot produce or afford to buy for 
precious hard currency 
a key factor in the delay is the political difficulty of going 
back on four decades of promises that the state will care for its 
citizens 
east bloc workers whose universal maxim is that we pretend to 
work and they pretend to pay us are generally disgusted with 
communism but hardly enthusiastic about the austerity and 
doubledigit inflation reform has brought 
real repairs for the easts economic plight will involve deep 
changes and take much longer than a year training course at the 
usfunded management school in budapest 
poland and hungary are ahead of their east bloc allies in 
permitting foreign ownership of domestic companies and forging 
hundreds of joint ventures with the west 
in april hungary became the first east bloc country to allow a 
stateowned enterprise the relatively successful tungsram light 
bulb company to be bought by westerners an austrian consortium 
eagerly pursuing all possible sources of capital hungary broke 
east bloc convention and forged diplomatic ties with south korea 
samsung corp is setting up its first hungarian factory to 
manufacture 300000 color televisions a year 
both poland and hungary also have small private banks hungary 
even has a fledgling stock exchange 
but the people who manage them suave sophisticates who learned 
their craft in new york or london know how long it will be before 
their enterprises resemble either 
ten years perhaps shrugged the young manager of a new 
austrohungarian banking venture

to a soviet tourist accustomed to buying 
sugar with ration coupons or a romanian surviving for months 
without proper meat a budapest supermarket is something close to 
paradise 
piles of paprika and heaps of fruit and vegetables adorn the 
shelves canned goods western beverages and attractively packaged 
foods are available and there are few lines or shortages 
but even in hungary the traditionally rich agrarian nation that 
president bush will visit next week the farming success story is 
turning sour 
almost 60 percent of the machinery on the 1253 cooperatives and 
131 state farms created by forced collectivization in the 1950s is 
rusty and outdated 
the workforce is aging and declining the prices paid to farmers 
are not keeping pace with increases in the cost of fertilizers and 
other supplies 
state investment is declining with the farmers seeing none of 
the extra revenue generated by three rounds of food price increases 
imposed by a cashstrapped government this year alone 
from 1975 to 1987 industrial prices rose 203 percent but the 
money paid to farmers for their produce increased just 64 percent 
robert burgert the manager of hungarys most successful state 
farm found it more profitable to invest his farms money in 
budapests infant bond market than in his land at balbona in western 
hungary 
the farmers anger at their worsening situation boiled over a 
year ago when winegrowers in kiskoros staged the first agricultural 
demonstration in memory demanding change 
with even official statistics showing a 20 percent decline in 
agricultural production from 1987 to 1988 and politicians 
increasingly willing to reform the winegrowers may get their wish 
a report commissioned by the ruling communist party has just 
recommended a wholesale return to easy lease terms and private land 
ownership in agriculture 
everywhere in eastern europe the small private farms and plots 
left intact by communism already account for a vastly 
disproportionate share of food produced 
in hungary for example private household plots that cover only 
55 percent of arable land accounted for 36 percent of all 
agricultural production in 1988 
a return to private ownership also would ease the credit squeeze 
on farmers who cannot use their land as collateral because it has 
no market price 
undoing four decades of communist farming however may prove 
politically difficult if it drives subsidized food prices up still 
further 
already consumers are feeling the crunch my teenage sons 
like to drink cocacola said zoltan a budapest bureaucrat with a 
salary above the monthly average of 6500 forints about 100 
but this year i had to tell them we just cant afford it 
in yugoslavia where inflation now tops 600 percent a year and 
elsewhere in eastern europe consumers have long grown used to 
shelling out large portions of their meager monthly incomes for food 
most of these supplies are available only at small markets where 
peasants sell produce from their plots 
in poland the first stop on bushs eastern europe itinerary a 
kilo of beef costs 4000 zlotys about 5 on the free market or 
some 6 percent of an average monthly wage in state stores where 
prices are lower but the stock phrase is nie ma there is 
none beef is almost never seen 
in romania every spare lei chases food president nicolae 
ceausescus drive to pay off foreign debt means that huge amounts of 
food are exported and his 23 million citizens inhabiting an area 
once known as the breadbasket of southeastern europe face chronic 
shortages 
in many cities bread is rationed butter cooking oil cheese or 
flour are regularly sold only in hardcurrency stores and a kilo of 
coffee on the black market fetches up to 1500 lei 150 half the 
monthly wage 
urban professionals may rise at dawn and line up all day on a 
rumor that meat will appear at a local store when it does hundreds 
of exhausted shoppers turn into angry hordes screaming at each 
other in the fight for a scrawny chicken 
such scenes are unknown in czechoslovakia and east germany where 
stores are relatively well stocked 
shop windows in prague famous for its hams display an enviable 
variety of meats and sausage at affordable prices 
but fruit and vegetables are far more scarce in june the 
czechoslovak state news agency revealed that consumption of 
vegetables has risen only 87 percent since before world war ii and 
does not meet the requirements of healthy nutrition 
the average east bloc housewife must manage to feed her family 
with almost none of the frozen foods that have become commonplace in 
the west household appliances to prepare food are also at a 
premium microwave ovens are unknown unless imported privately from 
the west and even refrigerators are so small that food is often 
kept on icy balconies in winter 
there is also a whole range of foods from avocados to zucchini 
that are considered common in the west but are virtually unknown in 
the east

its not exactly all work and no play 
but many who live in the soviet bloc nations of eastern europe say 
they rarely have either the time or money for recreation 
it is hard to have free time in poland said a woman who held 
a child in each hand as she left a market hall in central warsaw 
we have to stand on line and there is nothing in the stores 
romanians often spend up to five hours a day waiting in line for 
food because much of the food produced there is exported 
practically i have no leisure time with work the home the 
kids a warsaw businessman said 
some eastern europeans work as many as three jobs an air traffic 
controller in poland might also work as a nightclub bouncer or a 
university teacher might moonlight as an exterminator 
while stores and markets in hungary are wellstocked with fresh 
produce and meat other consumer items and appliances are in short 
supply hungarians have grown accustomed to working as long as 16 
hours a day to provide needed services 
ibolya kuzsel a hungarian woman with a 12yearold daughter has 
run her husbands workshop since he died last year kuzsel rises at 
530 each morning to do her chores before work her evenings are 
spent on the accounting saturdays she goes to the cemetery 
i have little time for my daughter she said 
president bush will spend four days in poland and hungary the 
first visit to the warsaw pact nations by an american president 
since 1977 
many eastern europeans find inexpensive recreation in television 
or weekend trips to the country and statistics show that alcohol is 
a popular escape despite attempts throughout the bloc to curb its 
use 
hungarians spend an average of one months salary on alcohol each 
year that nation has the highest alcoholrelated cirrhosis 
mortality rate in europe romania is second 
western television especially popular detective series provides 
diversion 
those in czechoslovakia hungary and poland who can afford it can 
buy satellite dishes to pick up western stations soviet television 
provides variety for some residents of romania and bulgaria 
weekend houses or bungalows are popular for residents of

real vacations are often too costly for most eastern europeans to 
even consider a weeks vacation in a modest setting for a polish 
family of four could cost three times the average monthly salary 
liberalized travel laws are allowing hungarians more access to 
the west with reasonably priced bus tours to turkey or greece 
costing about 210 the state travel agency also offers more

two experimental generating systems being 
developed in coal country could be among the answers to president 
bushs call for a 50percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions by the 
turn of the century 
the tennessee valley authority is working on a process called 
atmospheric fluidized bed combustion or afbc while the university 
of tennessee space institute is focusing on technology called 
magnetohydrodynamics mhd 
afbc works by mixing limestone into the coal that is burned as 
fuel the calcium in the limestone mixes with sulfur in the coal to 
form calcium sulfate a heavier material that settles and can be 
drained off the bottom 
mhd burns finely ground coal at very high temperatures adds a 
conductive agent to the resulting gas and passes it through a 
powerful magnetic field the field produces an electric current and 
the stillhot gas can be run through a conventional boiler to 
generate more power 
in essence you get more power out of the same pound of coal 
said joel muehlhauser director of the program which has spent 68 
million in department of energy money since 1977 and was given 
another 114 million through 1990 
while mhd is cleaner and more efficient than most conventional 
methods it has drawbacks including the stress on materials from 
the temperatures and the corrosiveness of the gas after a conductor 
has been added 
tva ran a 20 megawatt pilot plant using afbc from 1982 until last 
year testing it for 20000 hours in october it opened a 
commercialscale generator at its shawnee plant near paducah ky 
it is not quite as efficient as a conventional plant with no 
pollution control equipment on it said arnold manaker a tva 
engineer its like an automobile they get more power without all 
the converters on them 
but it is cleaner the pilot plant burns coal with 4 percent 
sulfur and has emissions equivalent to a regular plant using 1 
percent sulfur coal which costs nearly twice as much he said 
afbc is relatively expensive to install however manaker said it 
would cost about 400 to 800 per kilowatt of generating capacity 
compared to 100 to 300 per kilowatt for scrubbers which inject a 
watery mixture of ground limestone and water into the exhaust gases 
to neutralize the acids 
retrofitting with mhd would cost about 750 to 1500 per 
kilowatt said muehlhauser

the food and drug administration says it plans 
to ban the use of methylene chloride a suspected carcinogen in 
hair spray and other aerosol cosmetic products 
the ban is based on studies showing that when inhaled methylene 
chloride can cause lung and liver tumors in laboratory mice said 
fda spokesman william grigg 
rules for the ban were published in thursdays federal register 
and were to take effect in 60 days 
most hair spray manufacturers have stopped using methylene 
chloride as a fire retardant and drying agent since the fda proposed 
the ban in december 1985 a recent fda survey of washingtonarea 
stores found only one brand containing the substance grigg said 
methylene chloride also is used to remove caffeine from coffee 
but the fda said it had no immediate plans to ban this use because 
studies show the cancer risk comes from inhaling the substance 
rather than drinking it

miller brewing co says it will try to 
capitalize on the success of its genuine draft brand by test 
marketing a lowcalorie version of the beer 
starting in july miller genuine draft light will be test 
marketed in louisville ky plus selected cities in california 
ohio and wisconsin 
since genuine draft has been such a success its only natural 
to bring out a lowcalorie brand kevin tripp draft light brand 
manager said thursday 
miller the nations no 2 brewer behind anheuserbusch inc 
introduced genuine draft in 1986 and the beer is among the fastest 
growing brands in the country 
meanwhile light beers have been one of the biggest growing 
segments in a stagnant overall market 
jerry steinman publisher of beer marketers insights an 
industry newsletter said miller is trying to combine the success of 
genuine draft with the growth of the lowcalorie market 
its certainly a wise move he said 
analysts warn that genuine draft light may eat away sales both 
from genuine draft and from miller lite the top selling lowcalorie 
beer in the country but they add miller would only undertake such a 
venture if the company believed it could boost overall sales 
thats always a risk that it will cannibalize another brand 
said john collopy who stuies the beer industry and is president of 
the milwaukee investment firm of cleary gull reiland mcdevitt amp 
collopy inc but they obviously have confidence it will work 
while miller lite is by far the topselling lowcalorie beer in 
the country and the no 2 brand overall it has been facing an 
increased threat from bud light and coors light which rank as the 
no 3 and 4 brands in the country respectively 
what we are saying is the category is growing so it makes 
sense to have more than one brand tripp said

eastern airlines and its major creditors 
indicating they were nearing agreement on a reorganization plan for 
the strikebound company have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to 
extend easterns exclusive right to submit such a plan the parties 
said 
the joint request to extend the period for two weeks through july 
21 was made because the parties have made good progress in 
negotiations and believe the extra time will bring them closer to a 
final plan joel zweibel the attorney representing easterns major 
creditors said thursday 
a company that seeks chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection 
from creditors has the sole right to submit a reorganization plan to 
the court during the first 120 days of its case after which other 
parties may propose plans 
eastern wants to rebuild as a smaller carrier and pay off debts 
with the proceeds of some 18 billion in asset sales including 
several that already have been approved by the bankruptcy court 
the reorganization plan also addresses how creditors and 
shareholders would be treated 
the joint request could signal another setback for a buyout 
proposal for miamibased eastern led by the airlines striking 
unions and chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie 
ritchie the president of chicago research amp trading group 
presented to a congressional subcommittee thursday a competing plan 
already submitted to easterns creditors that he said could 
restore the airline as a major competitor in the airline 
industry 
eastern filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors on march 
9 five days after it was hit by a machinists union strike that was 
joined by pilots and flight attendants 
on tuesday eastern and the creditors group asked us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland to extend the exclusivity period due to end 
july 7 lifland scheduled a july 5 hearing on the extension request 
and other issues in the case 
easterns three unions are represented on the creditors committee 
dan ashby a spokesman for the air line pilots association said 
the company is unable to come up with a viable business plan and 
theyre stalling for time 
zweibel declined to speculate on the prospects for lifland 
granting a twoweek extension however he said that in most large 
bankruptcy cases much longer extensions usually are requested and 
granted 
one would think that in a case of this size and complexity 
it is quite typical to grant an initial extension he said 
eastern and the creditors committee believe that meaningful 
progress is being made in the negotiation of a consensual plan of 
reorganization a plan that will provide for the payment in full 
with interest of all allowed claims the document filed with the 
court states 
it requests the extension in order to provide the time to bring 
negotiations hopefully closer to fruition and then to draft a 
consensual plan the extra time would allow eastern and the 
creditors to resolve unspecified issues the document says

the president of the cashpoor investment firm 
integrated resources inc says a plan to refinance 955 million in 
shortterm debt should help lift the company out of an 
embarrassing situation 
integrated announced a plan thursday to refinance all shortterm 
debt the real estate and investment firm defaulted on earlier this 
month the plan includes 300 million in mortgage notes to be issued 
by drexel burnham lambert inc and a debtswap program 
this is truly an embarrassing situation for us integrated 
president arthur goldberg said in a statement at the annual 
shareholders meeting thursday we are doing everything we can to 
get this company back on its feet 
the plan apparently requires full approval by all integrateds 
bankers and commercial paper holders said tony fisher assistant 
vice president of moodys investors service inc 
that may be difficult to obtain he said 
basically this is a preliminary step to try and resolve the 
situation in a way which gives the debt holders partial payment now 
and asks them to wait a little longer for further payment he 
added 
integrated said it would use 90 percent of the proceeds from new 
senior mortgage notes issued by drexel to pay off a portion of the 
outstanding shortterm debt the struggling firm defaulted on earlier 
this month 
integrated which sells insurance policies mutual funds and real 
estate limited partnerships said the remaining 655 million in 
shortterm debt would be exchanged for a variety of lowerquality 
securities 
integrateds 50 banks withdrew access to shortterm credit 
markets amid signs of weakening financial condition at the firm 
which has 11 billion in capital 78 billion in assets and a 
sales force of 4600 
our principal objective is to bring stability back to the 
company as quickly as possible goldberg said to do this we 
need a real plan which debtholders can agree to quickly we believe 
this plan accomplishes that objective 
it will restore stability and avoid other more dire 
consequences he added 
drexel said it would itself buy a third of the 300 million in 
new firstmortgage notes which would be secured by a first lien on 
all the companys assets it said it was highly confident it could 
sell the remaining 200 million to other investors 
the rest of the shortterm debt would be exchanged for a variety 
of lowerquality securities including junior notes that would pay 
interest in the form of more notes the company said a breakdown of 
the securities had not been determined 
some debt also would be exchanged for stock doubling or tripling 
the number of integrateds common shares goldberg said that would 
dilute the value of existing stock 
the new notes would be for a term of three years integrated 
said while the exchange offers would begin in a few weeks 
the company also announced thta it is suspending dividend 
payments on its preferred stock 
integrated common stock which has plunged from more than 16 a 
share a month ago fell another 25 cents to 425 in new york stock 
exchange trading thursday but its debt securities rose a 13 
percent note due in 1995 rose 2 to 3050 in nyse trading 
goldberg said the company plans to sell a number of assets 
including its interest in taxsheltered annuities a block of 
ordinary life insurance policies and its interest in american real 
estate partners a limited partnership 
among integrateds shortterm debt obligations when it defaulted 
were 373 million in commercial paper and loan shares due within 45 
days the debt payments amounted to about 8 million a day 
the companys problems do not affect any of its 35 subsidiaries 
which have about 750000 investor accounts among its subsidiaries 
are integrated resources life insurance co of des moines iowa and 
capitol life insurance co of denver

bank one texas will start life next week with a 
clean balance sheet 500 million in new capital and expectations 
that texas consumers will benefit from a new player in the state 
bank one will be created from the remnants of the 20 failed 
subsidiary banks of mcorp a troubled dallas bank holding company 
banc one corp of columbus ohio was selected late wednesday by 
government regulators to buy the 20 banks and plans to rename them 
bank one texas 
banc one was selected over several other bidders including some 
texas banks that analysts had predicted had the inside track to the 
states third largest bank holding company 
but after banc one was chosen some of the same analysts praised 
the decision crediting its reputation for innovation in the 
consumer banking market and strong equity with overcoming the 
instate banks perceived advantages 
investors apparently also were pleased banc one stock was the 
most actively traded issue thursday on the new york stock exchange 
jumping 5 to 33 a share from wednesdays close 
the deal is expected to be the secondlargest bank bailout in 
history costing the government about 2 billion the biggest was 
last years government rescue of another texas bank first 
republicbank corp which regulators say may end up costing 3 
billion 
banc one is contributing 500 million to the deal in a complex 
arrangement that will permit it to exclude the texas operation from 
its consolidated balance sheet and maintain its record as one of the 
nations five most profitable banks 
although it initially will own only 75 percent of the texas 
bank banc one is committed to buy 100 percent by the end of five 
years 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman said 
2 billion was the agencys best estimate of the bailout cost 
but cautioned that it could end up being 200 million to 300 
million too high or too low most of the money will go toward 
covering losses on the failed banks 3 billion to 35 billion in 
sour commercial real estate loans 
however banc one chairman john b mccoy told reporters thursday 
in dallas that the amount of bad loans could reach 5 billion 
mccoy said banc one immediately will begin putting its credit 
card expertise to work mailing credit card applications to all bank 
one texas customers 
we think that our skill is as a retail bank and were not sure 
there has been a great retail bank in texas mccoy said 
it is the middle market the retail lending that gives you the 
margin gives you the growth mccoy said predicting that with a 
little luck bank one texas would double in size to 20 billion in 
assets in five years 
bank one texas which will take over wednesday will have 65 
branches covering most of the states major markets and about 13 
billion in assets although mccoy said that could drop to about 10 
billion after bad assets are pruned 
banc one has 253 billion in assets and also owns banks in ohio 
illinois indiana kentucky michigan and wisconsin it has been a 
leader in automated and computerized banking and has aggressively 
promoted consumer services such as credit cards auto loans and 
student loans 
i think its an excellent choice in terms of strengthening 
competition in the texas markets said industry consultant alex 
sheshunoff in austin 
for banc one it makes a tremendous amount of sense because the 
best part of the texas market is the consumer market consumers are 
still buying refrigerators cars and making bank deposits he said 
the net result is texas will now become the beirut of banking 
with west coast new york midwest and north carolina banks trying 
out their most innovative techniques in texas 
besides banc one new yorks chemical banking corp ncnb corp 
of charlotte nc and los angeles first interstate bancorp have 
come to the rescue of some of texas largest banks 
since the rebuilding of texas shattered banking industry began 
about two years ago seven of the states 10 largest bank holding 
companies have been recapitalized with outside money bids for two 
of the remaining three are currently being reviewed by the fdic 
the selection of banc one was seen as an attempt to correct one 
of texas underlaying bank weaknesses 
there has been virtually no consumer banking until the last 
year or so said painewebber inc analyst sandra flannigan in 
houston the texas banks didnt have to concern themselves because 
the commercial side was so profitable 
but the failures of the energy industry and subsequent real 
estate weakness erased that profitability

the board of air midwest inc rejected a 
st louis companys 311 million offer to buy the commuter airline 
the board said thursday the 8ashare offer by resort air inc 
was inadequate according to air midwest chairman robert l priddy 
air midwest which feeds braniff at kansas city international 
airport has asked kidder peabody amp co inc to act as its adviser 
in determining an appropriate price for the airline priddy said 
air midwest has the largest commuter operation at kci air 
midwest and resort air both feed trans world airlines at lambertst 
louis international airport 
analysts said the rejection was expected and that resort air 
probably would come back with another friendly offer 
there has to be a meeting of the minds on the price said 
samuel buttrick an airline analyst in memphis tenn if you read 
between the lines of air midwests press release you get the 
impression that they would seriously consider a higher offer 
analysts expect air midwest to have a profitable second quarter 
which they said should continue increasing the companys value air 
midwests stock was unchanged at 787 thursday in overthecounter 
trading 
i think the board of directors was looking at where the stock 
price would be a month from now in rejecting the offer said 
daniel hersh an airline analyst in los angeles 
hersh said there did not appear to be any other potential buyers 
for air midwest 
buttrick said he expected air midwest to earn about 14 million 
for the three months that will end today buttrick also said he 
expected a final offer of 11 to 12 a share 
resort air owned by businessman hulas kanodia is smaller than 
air midwest 
air midwest said last week an agreement depended upon the ability 
of resort air to arrange financing resort air is thought to be 
backed by the bankers trust new york corp

a group headed by wasserstein perella amp co on 
friday raised its bid for the british foodstore chain gateway corp 
plc by 71 million in an effort to defeat an offer from rival 
isosceles plc 
the aggressive new york investment firm and its partner the 
great atlantic amp pacific tea co is now offering 375 a share up 
from 367 a share 
based on gateways roughly 890 million shares outstanding the 
new offer is worth about 334 billion the bidders operating under 
the name newgateway said this was their final offer 
while the bid exceeds the 356ashare cash portion of the 
isosceles offer it falls short of what isosceles advisers claim 
their cashandstock bid is worth under a revised valuation of the 
offers equity component salomon brothers international put the 
value at between 379 and 387 a share 
investor skepticism over the salomon valuation was reflected in 
the marketplace gateway shares moved only narrowly around 367 
the previous level of the newgateway offer 
isosceles which opened the bidding for gateway in april 
disclosed friday that the number of gateway shares it controls has 
slipped to 440 percent from the 448 percent it claimed at the end 
of last week 
the decline appears to be the result of withdrawals from 
shareholders who at one time had signalled their intention of 
accepting the offer sg warburg amp co an adviser to isosceles 
said holders of 1358 million common shares or about 152 percent 
had withdrawn their acceptances

strikebound eastern airlines must either 
restructure itself as a smaller carrier as its management plans or 
liquidate says a courtappointed bankruptcy examiner 
the examiner david i shapiro told a congressional hearing 
thursday that a unionbacked takeover plan to restore the airline to 
full operations with former defense secretary frank carlucci as 
interim head is not viable 
eastern owner frank lorenzo and the court previously rejected the 
plan but the house public works and transportation aviation 
subcommittee gave it another airing in the committees effort to 
find a way to restore eastern as a major carrier 
carlucci told the panel that turning the airline over to chicago 
businessman joseph ritchie and eastern unions is the only way to 
save the airline as a major carrier ritchie had asked carlucci to 
temporarily head the airline if the sale is approved 
at the same hearing eastern reiterated plans to resume more of 
its flights this sunday and work up to 50 percent of its prestrike 
schedule by august the airline has been operating only a few 
flights since march when a machinists strike supported by pilots 
and flight attendants led it to file for reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy laws 
shapiro who represents and advises the federal bankruptcy court 
in new york told the subcommittee that major eastern assets must be 
sold to reduce the enormous interest burden on the company 
the airline has debts totalling 36 billion 
these past months have left me with the reluctant but firm 
conviction that only two practical alternative remain in this 
case said shapiro the first is a reorganization plan premised 
on a smaller eastern airlines the second is liquidation 
shapiro said ritchies plan included no firm offer to lorenzos 
texas air in payment for the airline and had no operational plan 
that would keep the airline flying he said ritchie had failed in a 
dozen meetings with court officials to provide a confidential letter 
showing he had financial backing for his plan 
ritchies plan flunked in operational viability and it flunked 
in financial viability and is still flunking shapiro said 
shapiro said he still sees a ray of hope in talks he is 
holding with striking unions trying to convince them to accept a 
scaleddown airline and return to work 
the unions however repeated that they will not work for 
lorenzo head of texas air which owns eastern and nonunion 
continental airlines 
henry duffy president of the air line pilots association said 
lorenzo was maneuvering to sell off easterns assets and close it 
down eastern claims assets of 6 billion but potential purchasers 
say its worth a couple of billion dollars less 
phil bakes eastern president said the airlines training of 
pilots and preparations to increase flights show lorenzo does not 
plan to sell off any more than the 18 billion in assets previously 
announced 
he said eastern is losing 17 million a day because of the 
strike but plans to build itself up to 70 percent of its previous 
level 
carlucci defense secretary in the latter part of the reagan 
administration told the panel he is still willing to act as an 
interim chief executive of the airline if ritchies offer is 
accepted 
this approach is the only one that has a chance of restoring 
eastern to its once proud status he said 
ritchie president of chicago research amp trading group said his 
plan calls for 100 million in new money from his own funds the 
unions and other investors and 200 million or more in new financing

the postal service announced today that it will 
begin setting up operations in major shopping malls across the 
nation 
assistant postmaster general gordon c morison said the agency is 
planning to negotiate contracts for operation of postal service 
centers in major stores at shopping malls 
no locations were announced 
like several thousand contract postal outlets in drug stores 
groceries and other retail facilities the new centers will be 
operated by employees of the stores where they are located and will 
be open when the stores are open 
eleven sears roebuck and co stores in the chicago region have 
been operating such centers on a test basis since last october 
morison said these have been popular with customers 
the sears offices drew criticism from the american postal workers 
union because they were staffed by sears employees rather than 
postal workers 
morison said the facilities are no threat to the jobs of postal 
workers that additional revenue generated by them helps create more 
delivery and mailprocessing jobs 
the sears operations will be phased out with the introduction of 
the new facilities in shopping malls but those will still be 
contract offices not staffed by postal workers said postal service 
spokesman ralph stewart 
individual sears stores will be eligible to bid for the new 
facilities along with other mall stores

the seabrook nuclear plants no 2 
executive has been fired one week after lowpower testing was 
abruptly suspended because of improper control room procedures a 
spokesman said today 
george thomas a vice president in charge of nuclear production 
at the 6 billion reactor was relieved of all plant duties on 
thursday because of inappropriate management actions after the 
june 22 reactor shutdown plant spokesman ron sher said 
he would not specify what actions by thomas led to the firing 
saying only that thomas was in the control room as an observer at 
the time of the shutdown and that the problem with thomas came 
after the shutdown not before 
it is premature to discuss just why he has been relieved 
sher said 
the nuclear regulatory commission the state attorney general and 
the plant are investigating what occurred after control room workers 
learned of a valve malfunction that forced the shutdown after nine 
days of testing 
after he was fired from the seabrookrelated position thomas 
resigned from his position as a vice president with public service 
company of new hampshire the chief owner of the plant 
details of thomas departure will be in a report to the nrc 
which the plant has said will be submitted to the commission by 
early july 
the utility has acknowledged that seabrook control room operators 
did not follow proper procedures after a faulty valve in the 
nonnuclear side of the plant caused a malfunction in pressure 
during lowpower testing 
nrc officials have said it took inspectors five minutes and 
discussions with at least three people to persuade them to shut down 
the reactor 
thomas reached at his home this morning said he had no comment

after numerous rumors about a possible takeover 
of steinberg inc oxdon investments inc has come forward with 
another bid for the canadian grocery giant 
oxdon a consortium led by unicorp canada corp of toronto 
thursday announced it is making an offer worth about 129 billion 
canadian for all outstanding common and class a shares of the 
retailing company 
based on current exchange rates the value of the offer is about 
108 billion us 
oxdon previously has attempted to get control of steinberg two 
proposals made earlier this year were lower than the latest one 
only two days ago a spokesman for unicorp dismissed talk of a 
renewed effort by oxdon to acquire steinberg as wild rumors 
trading in steinberg shares on the toronto and montreal exchanges 
has been halted since tuesday when exchange officials said they 
became aware of a situation that could have a material impact on 
the shares 
under oxdons new proposal detailed in a statement steinberg 
would become a real estate concern and its retail and wholesale 
businesses would be put up for sale 
holders of steinberg common shares are being offered a choice of 
75 cash canadian or 15 oxdon restricted voting shares for each 
common share and class a shareholders are being offered a choice of 
50 cash canadian or one oxdon restricted voting share for each 
class a share 
steinberg has been considered a likely takeover target since 1988 
when a family dispute prompted the board of directors to seek offers 
for the company 
oxdon said it has met with representatives of steinbergs 
controlling shareholders to discuss the possibility of acquiring 
their steinberg shares 
if it succeeds oxdon said it will review steinberg assets and 
liabilities with a view to reorganizing the company 
that would likely involve the sale of all nonreal estate 
business operations oxdon said 
the company said it would use steinbergs existing quebec real 
estate holdings as the foundation for an expanding quebecbased real 
estate development company whose head office would remain in 
montreal 
steinberg is controlled by mitzi dobrin marilyn cobrin and 
evelyn alexander the three daughters of sam steinberg through 
their majority ownership of the voting shares they own about 52 per 
cent of the voting stock

a skeptical report from a federal 
laboratory hasnt reduced optimism in utah that the suns energy 
source can be produced at room temperature as fusion research moves 
ahead with the help of general electric 
the university of utah and ge announced wednesday that their 
scientists will collaborate in attempts to verify and explain the 
widely disputed findings announced in march by university chemist b 
stanley pons and british colleague martin fleischmann 
the collaboration is the first such agreement the university has 
made with a major corporation but doesnt rule out similar 
arrangements with other companies said james brophy the schools 
vice president for research 
pons and fleischmann maintain they were able in a tabletop 
experiment to produce more than 100 times the energy needed to 
produce it 
some researchers at other laboratories have duplicated parts of 
the experiment but ames laboratory officials said in ames iowa 
that they had been unable to produce results similar to those 
claimed by pons and fleischmann 
i wish i could tell you otherwise tom barton a professor of 
chemistry at iowa state university and director of the federal 
laboratory said i was just as excited as everybody else when the 
revelations were made 
i thought our energy crisis was over he said 
we explored the findings to the limits of our equipment and 
expertise he said wednesday im sorry to say we detected 
nothing it would have been exciting 
ames laboratory physicist joseph shinar said scientists are no 
longer thinking of cold fusion as a source of energy but he said 
academics will continue looking into the matter 
at the utah capitol on thursday the state fusion advisory 
council met privately to hear progress reports from utah and texas 
scientists the council was created to decide whether and how to 
spend 5 million set aside by the legislature to fund fusion 
research 
randy moon state science adviser and a member of the council 
said members were very encouraged and very upbeat about the 
presentations but he wouldnt elaborate

a ruptured pipeline at a chevron ship 
terminal dumped about 8000 gallons of oil into the willamette river 
early today but most of the oil was contained quickly a coast 
guard spokesman said 
a coast guard helicopter flying over the scene reported a light 
sheen of oil from the chevron dock to the mouth of the river about 
seven miles north 
a 16inch oil pipeline ruptured underneath the shipyard dock 
while an oil mixture known as charge stock was being transferred 
onto the chevron louisiana tanker said coast guard lt cmdr david 
gault charge stock is a liquid form of asphalt mixed with 2 percent 
to 3 percent diesel oil 
chevron notified the coast guard of the spill shortly after 
midnight gault said refinery workers set out containment booms and 
shut down the pipelines and by 130 am 99 percent of the oil had 
been confined to the dock area 
by daylight crews from chevron and riedel environmental services 
began raking the oil mixture onto absorbent pads and pulling the 
pads out of the water said refinery planner dennis sorensen 
the tides and winds were such that the oil was held in a cove 
near the dock sorensen said he said the main spill was about 200 
feet by 100 feet 
a spill response team was on its way from chevron headquarters in 
san francisco and sorensen said the experts would be able to 
estimate the damage 
chevron could be fined up to 5000 for the spill gault said

for five years the foxboro cos factory in china 
looked like a questionable investment but generated wonderful 
publicity now its the reverse 
foxboro has finally begun bringing home profits from the 10 
million plant within the past year and executives insist that the 
outlook for profitability remains strong in spite of the current 
turmoil 
meanwhile though the company faces a public relations problem 
because of the chinese armys bloody suppression of the student 
democracy movement 
executives are quick to point out that the white stucco plant in 
shanghai where 400 chinese workers make industrial process control 
equipment accounts for only about 2 percent of foxboros 540 
million in worldwide sales 
its important for them to get that message out because many 
companies that are associated with china have seen their stock 
prices tumble since tanks rolled into beijings tiananmen square on 
june 34 
foxboro officials are also on the defensive against calls for the 
us government to impose stiff sanctions and for american firms to 
pull out of china 
unfortunately or fortunately the people with facilities there 
cant pick up and leave said gerald j gleason a foxboro vice 
president 
youve transferred the technology youve transferred the 
skills if america withdrew its 32 billion worth of investment 
all wed be doing is giving a gift of those assets to the chinese 
authorities and i dont think thats what would serve either our 
national or our business interests best 
you always have to look over your shoulder when you go into a 
venture like this gleason said but we never thought it would 
backslide this far 
based in the southern massachusetts town of foxboro the 
81yearold company has a worldwide work force of 6000 people 
engaged in producing measurement devices and control systems for oil 
refineries paper mills breweries and other industrial plants 
chinese officials eager to modernize their economy invited the 
firm to form a joint venture in 1979 starting a threeyear series 
of negotiations that gleason likens to a ritual mating dance in 
which we didnt know the words or the music 
when the foxboroshanghai ltd plant finally opened in 1982 it 
was the first uschinese joint venture in hightechnology 
manufacturing and it quickly became a showcase 
although its sales amounted to only a few million dollars a year 
in the mid1980s foxboro basked in reflected glory as the factory 
was visited by ronald reagan henry kissinger chinese leaders and 
the heads of several fortune 500 companies 
doing business in china took some adjustment former general 
manager don sorterup said he had difficulty persuading chinese 
workers to use telephones or memos to resolve problems rather than 
bicycling across the city to speak in person 
management was however able to persuade the chinese to do 
without the usual halfday per week of political education in the 
workplace pay for a sixday workweek is 54 to 90 
company spokesman richard sherman said the plant which is 51 
percentowned by the chinese government and 49 percentowned by 
foxboro was profitable from the start but for the first five 
years both sides agreed to plow back all their profits 
late last year for the first time the venture began paying 
dividends to the home company 
following the crackdown on the student demonstrators foxboro 
pulled out its two resident american employees the factorys 
deputy general manager and chief engineer for their safety 
for a week the factory was virtually shut down as unrest 
paralyzed the countrys public transportation system and only about 
a quarter of the employees showed up for work 
since then though it has been running normally prompting a mix 
of wariness and optimism among the americans 
i think itll settle down enough to send our people back in the 
nottoodistant future said gleason but personally i dont 
think they can completely rebottle the whole thing i dont think 
this government will be secure and settled for a long time 
the factorys revenue roughly doubled to 20 million last year 
and gary k willis foxboros chief executive said he believes it 
will continue to be successful 
we expect that as stated by chinese officials and our own 
administration the economic reforms and the progress that china has 
made will continue he said 
were pleased by the progress the joint venture has made and we 
expect it to continue to grow

time inc shareholders today reelected a slate 
of four incumbent directors including chairman richard munro who 
reiterated managements opposition to a 122 billion hostile buyout 
offer from paramount communications inc and advances by any other 
potential suitors 
the company is not for sale munro said in response to 
questions by shareholders at times annual meeting 
munro and other time officials fielded a number of questions from 
people attending the giant media companys first stockholder meeting 
since paramount announced its hostile 200 a share cash buyout offer 
many shareholders openly have questioned the companys rejection 
of the paramount offer and its decision to alternatively pursue a 
14 billion buyout of warner communications inc 
shareholders reelected board members munro who also is chief 
executive president nicholas j nicholas jr vice chairman jerry 
levin and outside director donald s perkins who ran unopposed the 
slate won support from 74 percent of the shares voting and 55 
percent of times total common shares outstanding 
time stock was down 112 at 15462 a share in midday trading 
on the new york stock exchange warner was up 12 cents to 6012 a 
share and paramount slipped 187 to 59 a share 
the meeting originally was called for june 23 for shareholders to 
vote on times original stockswap merger deal with warner and the 
board election 
after paramount announced a 107 billion takeover bid for time 
june 6 the meeting was rescheduled and time officials withdrew the 
merger proposal from the agenda 
several shareholders demanded to know today why the paramount bid 
and the proposed acquisition of warner were not put to a vote time 
officials said shareholder ballots are not required under law 
because the company is not for sale and because time stock will not 
be diluted in a warner acquisition 
were working within all the rules munro said it applies 
to all companies 
the tone of the nearly twohour meeting which filled the grand 
ballroom of the new york hilton was cordial many of the 
shareholders attending also were time employees who applauded in 
support of management 
time maintains that paramounts offer since increased to 122 
billion is financially inadequate and subject to too many 
conditions including paramounts obtaining commitments for buyout 
financing and approvals to operate about 800 cable television system 
time owns 
paramount also has made its offer contingent on time and warner 
terminating their own buyout agreement 
time is urging its shareholders not to be swayed by the size of 
the paramount bid which is 74 above the price at which time stock 
traded before paramount announced its offer june 6 and to hold 
their stock profiting by allowing the timewarner merger to go 
through 
on thursday paramount said it had taken a step toward satisfying 
one condition of its offer as seven major banks agreed to help raise 
financing for the bid 
paramount said each of the seven banks serving as coagents in a 
planned financing syndicate will contribute 1 billion or a total 
of 7 billion toward the 156 billion estimated financing costs 
although it did not yet have commitments for the rest of the money 
the seven led by chemical bank include two japanese banks and 
two canadian banks the two other us banks are bank of america and 
chase manhattan 
the seven also will lead a planned syndicate of banks intended to 
provide 90 percent of the financing for the hostile buyout 
paramount has said the syndicate would provide 14 billion while the 
remaining 16 billion would be raised through the sale of debt 
securities 
meanwhile a group of us european canadian and japanese 
banking officials met at the timelife building thursday to hear a 
presentation from bankers trust co and manufacturers hanover trust 
co the new york times reported in todays editions those two 
banks are trying to arrange 14 billion in loans that time could use 
to complete its offer for warner

companies filed thursday in delaware chancery court while mai did 
not indicate how much it was willing to offer the company said in 
its suit a bid higher than whitneys would be made soon 
whitney a new yorkbased venture capital firm has a tender 
offer under way for as many as 495 million prime shares the firm 
is paying 2150 a share or about 106 billion after the tender 
offer whitney will swap debentures for the remaining outstanding 
shares 
mai originally bid 20 a share for prime but earlier this month 
scaled back the offer to 1950 a share for 495 million shares and 
notes for the remaining shares the offer is believed to have a 
blended value of between 17 and 18 a share analysts have said 
in its lawsuit mai charged that the bidding for prime had been 
rigged and is seeking to have the auction for the natick 
massbased company reopened 
in addition mai a computer maker headquartered in tustin 
calif wants whitney to return to prime the 20 million it received 
in expense fees 
charging that the fee was improperly paid to whitney mai said 
the return of the money to prime would ensure that the amount of 
money mai basic can pay prime shareholders can be correspondingly 
increased 
in its suit mai complained of favoritism between prime and 
whitney mai cited several ties between the two companies over the 
years including the fact that prime chairman david dunn once worked 
as a partner at whitney 
mai also is seeking confidential business information about prime 
needed to complete its due diligence review as well as reimbursement 
for its costs and attorneys fees 
a judge has yet to be assigned in the case 
in new york stock exchange trading prime was down 12 cents at 
1912 a share late friday 
prime said friday it believed mais lawsuit was entirely 
without merit 
anthony craig primes chief executive issued a statement 
saying the whitney merger agreement offers prime shareholders a 
significant increase over mais existing 1950 partial tender offer 
and greater value than what mai was willing to offer in the auction 
and negotiations that occurred last week mai is way off base in 
alleging that there was a rigged auction mai lost because it was 
not willing to pay top dollar

lf rothschild holdings inc parent of a 
venerable wall street investment firm that suffered staggering 
losses from the 1987 stock market collapse sought friday to 
reorganize under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
the filing for protection from creditors does not include lf 
rothschild amp co a registered brokerdealer which is rothschild 
holdings principal subsidiary 
rothschild holdings which lost 84 million in the quarter ended 
march 31 is in default on three debt issues totaling 60 million 
and wants to restructure its debt to reduce interest expenses 
according to spokesman kenneth henderson 
separately the rothschild co brokerage said it intends to 
reenter the retail business with a discount operation pitting the 
firm against such bigger discount brokers as fidelity investments 
and charles schwab corp 
rothschild co once a leader in public stock offerings for 
hightech companies also will continue to offer corporate finance 
and investment banking services with a greater focus on 
middlemarket and smaller capitalized companies 
rothschild holdings filed its chapter 11 petition with the 
bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york in manhattan 
henderson said the company soon would file its reorganization plan 
which includes the swapping of existing debt for zerocoupon debt to 
cut current interest expenses 
the companys board of directors said that while the move may 
affect the firm adversely in the shortterm following a 
successful reorganization rothschild will be better positioned 
to expand its business through the brokerage arm and ultimately 
become profitable 
henderson said rothschild co has a large number of deals in 
the works mostly involving mergers and acquisitions and leveraged 
buyouts but he could not elaborate 
with 75 employees the current rothschild is a shadow of the 
oldline investment house and fullservice brokerage that employed 
as many as 2200 people before the oct 19 1987 stock market crash 
rothschild was formed in 1899 as lf rothschild amp co in 1977 it 
merged with ce unterberg towbin co then a young investment 
boutique but management strife forced out partners a robert towbin 
and thomas unterberg shortly after the company went public in 1986 
as of jan 1 1987 rothschild ranked as the 18th largest us 
securities firm with capital of 289 million but by the end of the 
year rothschild posted a 129 million annual loss 56 million of 
which resulted from arbitrage and overthecounter trading positions 
held during the black monday market debacle 
in an attempt to rebound and slash fixed costs rothschild 
systematically sold or abandoned its retail brokerage public 
finance and municipal bond sales and trading operations it also 
ceased overthecounter market making arbitrage and the selling and 
trading of mortgagebacked and highgrade corporate securities 
the firm which in late 1986 became one of just 40 primary 
dealers that could buy and sell government securities as both 
principals and agents left that business in january 
the object in the recent past is to reduce operations and 
be as efficient as possible and go into businesses with the 
lowest overhead henderson said 
a year ago rothschild holdings became a subsidiary of franklin 
financial services a services company that itself is a subsidiary 
of ottawa kanbased franklin savings association 
regarding the brokerage businesss plans to offer discount 
brokerage services henderson said were aware that it is a very 
competitive business but we do have customer lists from our old 
retail operations and can rely on the rothschild name 
except for advertising the cost of setting up discount brokerage 
operations will be minimal henderson said backoffice operations 
which he described as the heaviest contributor to overhead will be 
handled by another firm

takeover target lin broadcasting corp lost the 
final round in a legal fight friday with metromedia inc over the 
right to buy metromedias interests in cellular telephone systems in 
philadelphia and new york 
new yorks highest court ruled that corporate partners that hold 
rights of first refusal for future buyouts cannot force one another 
to sell out if a sale to another party is abandoned 
lins stock price tumbled as investors dumped shares following 
news of the ruling falling 712 to 11587 in national 
overthecounter trading 
the company which is the object of a hostile 120 a share bid by 
mccaw cellular communications had estimated its stock value could 
rise by up to 40 a share if it won the metromedia case the selloff 
apparently reflected speculation that lins defeat might mean mccaw 
would amend its 585 billion offer 
the case before the state court of appeals involved multimillion 
dollar agreements on cellular phone businesses in the new york city 
and philadelphia metropolitan areas between lin and metromedia 
the two media companies were partners in two firms and each had 
the right of first refusal to buy the other out should the other 
company decide to sell to a third party 
metromedia decided to sell its holdings in cellular telephone 
company which served the new york city market and awacs inc 
which served philadelphia to southwestern bell metromedia advised 
lin of its intention giving lin the chance to buy the holdings 
instead 
before lin had accepted the offer however metromedia decided 
not to sell to southwestern bell but lin broadcasting contended 
that it still had the right to buy metromedias share in the two 
cellular firms for about 380 million 
the court disagreed and upheld a lower courts decision that said 
metromedia didnt have to sell its shares to lin broadcasting 
the appellate division of the state supreme court had ruled 
metromedia didnt have to sell out 
the court of appeals friday upheld that ruling 60 saying that 
lins arguments tried to equate a right of first refusal with an 
option 
a right of first refusal merely provides that before an owner 
sells it will first give the other party a chance to buy the 
court said in an opinion 
lin argues that the law should require that the first 
refusal offer be kept open for acceptance even after the 
contemplated third party sale has been abandoned the court said 
lin which has holdings in cellular telephones television and 
publishing said in a statement that the adverse decision does not 
affect lins rights of first refusal on any future sales that 
metromedia may pursue 
had lin prevailed over metromedia industry analysts estimated 
lins stock value might rise as much as 40 a share a defeat could 
prompt mccaw to amend possibly lowering its offer 
we are obviously disappointed by the outcome of the litigation 
although we have not yet said 
wayne m perry vice chairman of mccaw cellular said in a news 
release that the company was disappointed by the decision although 
it had not yet seen the ruling he also said that until mccaw and 
its advisers reviewed the ruling it would not be appropriate to 
comment further 
the release also noted that in its june 8 purchase offer mccaw 
reserved the right to amend its offer in the event of adverse 
developments in the pending linmetromedia litigation

paul a bilzerians piecemeal breakup of singer 
co since his stunning 106 billion takeover last year has spawned 
mountains of lawsuits and left the onetime sewing machine maker on 
shaky financial ground 
singer now a defense contractor is facing litigation nationwide 
seeking more than 700 million in damages while its assets total 
just 445 million according to court documents 
whatever its prior plans today the singer cos prospects for 
survival appear dim the government said in papers filed in 
baltimore that describe the companys financial condition as 
precarious 
bilzerian convicted by a federal jury of securities crimes 
earlier this month was charged thursday by the securities and 
exchange commission with disclosure violations in his january 1988 
takeover of singer also thursday he resigned as chairman chief 
executive and board member of singer 
after seizing singer with 19 billion in borrowed money 
bilzerian sold eight of the defense contractors 12 divisions 
shrank the work force to about 3800 last year from 28000 at the 
end of 1987 and moved headquarters from stamford conn to his 
hometown of tampa fla where about 20 people work today 
in march bilzerian even sold the worldfamous singer 
trademark to a torontobased electronics firm that acquired singers 
former sewing machine arm 
a federal court in baltimore in may blocked singer from selling 
any more assets without court approval after the justice department 
contended the company planned further sales that would leave it 
unable to pay damages in a case predating bilzerians arrival 
in that case the government claims that a singer unit sold last 
august link flight simulation corp had overcharged clients 
beginning in 1980 the government is seeking 231 million in damages 
even more legal problems have emerged since bilzerian moved in a 
group of more than 9000 singer retirees has asked a federal judge 
in new haven conn to force singer to set aside 235 million to 
pay health and life insurance benefits the workers claim are 
jeopardized by singers dismantling 
there is a legal tangle with corporate raider t boone pickenss 
mesa limited partnership which lent bilzerian 150 million during 
the singer takeover if pickens investment isnt paid back in full 
he could get a chance to control singers board 
other lawsuits filed by stockholders a former singer executive 
a bilzerian partner and other companies are pending in stamford new 
york california dallas baltimore and new jersey 
never in my wildest imagination did i anticipate that the 
company would be bought out and subsequently disbanded as it was 
said ralph seel a former singer manager who worked for the company 
43 years and filed the retirees lawsuit last year 
by and large it was looked at as a family business it had 
problems but never the kind that would cause the demise of a company 
that was founded in 1851 he said i still cant believe it 
myself 
bilzerians selloff of singers divisions from july to october 
last year netted close to 2 billion according to company filings 
with the sec that would have left the 39yearold bilzerian about 
100 million after paying back the money he borrowed to finance the 
takeover 
among divisions sold were singers gas meter and electric motors 
companies a maker of signal interception systems for us 
intelligence a maker of radar warning systems for the air force and 
other defense and aerospace firms 
the sales reduced singers assets to about 445 million from 
158 billion before the takeover the companys shareholder equity 
has shrunk to 80 million from 633 million and the government 
claims singer plans to deplete it even more 
in march the singer trademark was included in the acquisition of 
ssmc inc singers old sewing machine division that was spun off in 
mid1986 by international semitech microelectronics inc of 
toronto bilzerians singer has announced it is changing its name 
singer said in a statement announcing bilzerians resignation 
that the company is not being liquidated and there has never 
been any plan to liquidate it 
it said singer expects secondquarter profits of 15 million 
and continued profitability for the remainder of 1989 the 
statement said singer would continue to pay retirees life insurance 
and health care benefits 
singer attorneys and executives on friday refused to answer any 
questions about the company

banc one corp chairman john b mccoy said friday 
he has cooked up a new midwestern recipe to help turn around 20 
failed texas banks including a strategy of friendly competition 
and decentralized management 
under the plan which would include slashing real estate and 
other costs mccoy predicted the banks would become successful 
operations adding 6 percent to 15 percent to the companys earnings 
over the next five years 
we believe on day 1 were going to make money the head of 
the columbus ohio bank holding company told reporters following a 
presentation to securities analysts 
the federal deposit insurance corp announced wednesday that banc 
one had won the bidding war for dallasbased mcorps 20 failed 
banks banc one pledged to pay about 500 million over five years to 
buy the banks 
the banks were declared insolvent on march 28 seized by the fdic 
and packaged into a governmentowned institution called deposit 
insurance bridge bank or dibb 
the fdic will assume as much as 2 billion in bad loans making 
it the third costliest bank bailout 
the banks and their branches located in 22 texas cities will be 
split into three regions each will be managed separately with its 
own president and board of directors in place within a year he said 
twenty bright people running things are better than one bright 
person the chairman said 
mccoy said he will apply banc ones formula for success over the 
last 20 years to the new texas operations namely a very 
decentralized operation and the absolute best financial 
control banc one has about 253 billion in assets and reported 
1988 earnings of 340 million 
under the plan the banks would compete among themselves 
when youre running your own bank with your own income 
statement it makes you very comparable to everybody else he said 
i like peer pressure how come dallas is making more than 
houston the houston guy will get competitive will get better so 
its friendly peer pressure 
while some analysts view the transaction as a drastic change in 
direction for banc one which has built a reputation on making 
friendly acquisitions of successful banks mccoy said banc one is 
starting with no real risk 
basically what were getting is a bank with no bad loans he 
said we always said we didnt want to buy a bad bank we dont 
think this is a bad bank 
the acquisition will have no effect on banc ones 1989 earnings 
although the holding company will record some thirdquarter 
expenses banc one will be reimbursed by the government for all 
expenses incurred in the first 140 days he said 
in addition banc one hopes to dramatically reduce costs 
including 50 million to 100 million a year in real estate costs 
mccoy said it also will renegotiate equipment and other leases 
banc one will begin managing the banks july 5 under the name bank 
one texas and plans to purchase the banks after a four to 
sixmonth period during which problem assets would be identified 
mccoy said banc one would continue the conservative approach that 
has made it a success in midwest banking in addition it hopes to 
rebuild many of the core consumer operations that were sold off 
including credit card operations

striking eastern airlines pilots who might want 
to come back to work likely will find theyve already been bumped 
from their jobs according to company boss frank lorenzo 
pilots union officials were to meet this weekend with management 
and easterns courtappointed bankruptcy examiner to try to hammer 
out a contract agreement that would end their walkout against the 
company 
the air line pilots association contends the talks may be aimed 
at encouraging more strikeweary pilots to cross picket lines and 
they come at a time when lorenzo believes he holds most of the cards 
in an interview friday lorenzo said any returning strikers would 
find most of the available jobs at the new scaleddown eastern were 
taken up by the 500 or so new hires and 300 who crossed picket lines 
who already are working and by other pilots who will complete 
training in the weeks ahead 
eastern also is near agreement with creditors over its plan to 
emerge from bankruptcy court protection as a scaleddown carrier 
that would require only about 1700 pilots to operate by december at 
its target level of around twothirds of its prestrike size that 
compares with the 3600 that flew the prestrike version 
were not dependent on the pilots coming back by any means 
said lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp 
im afraid pilots union leaders have another agenda than 
resolving differences with management he said the agenda is to 
show theyre opec and theyre not going to allow anybody to break 
their price line 
the pilots and eastern flight attendants joined a machinists 
strike that began march 4 and the company sought bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors on march 9 
eastern and its major creditors this week asked us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland to extend easterns exclusive right to 
submit a reorganization plan indicating that all fundamental 
questions had been resolved and only technical differences remained 
were pretty close lorenzo said 
eastern wants to rebuild as a smaller carrier and pay off debts 
with the proceeds of some 18 billion in asset sales including 
several that already have been approved by the bankruptcy court 
lifland already has approved a number of asset sales opposed by 
the unions including the sale of easterns prized northeast shuttle 
to developer donald trump 
and this weekend the airline is gearing up for a tripling of its 
daily schedule with 79 daily flights this week eastern planned to 
begin 226 daily flights beginning sunday 
the real game is being played out with the consumers with the 
traveling public lorenzo said eastern is reemerging as a 
quality airline 
in another setback for the unions david i shapiro the 
bankruptcy examiner for eastern told a congressional hearing 
thursday that the only alternatives for the airline were its 
proposed downsizing or liquidation 
but he said he would oppose liquidation and considered ritchies 
proposal not viable 
shapiro also said that in this weekends talks in washington he 
wanted to persuade the unions that easterns operations must be 
scaled down to survive 
similar talks during the week yielded no tangible results and 
sources close to the situation say they expected the impasse to 
continue despite planned roundtheclock sessions alpa officials 
say they dont expect eastern to offer the jobsecurity provisions 
the union says would be necessary for an agreement 
eastern recently sought bankruptcy court permission to cancel its 
contract with the air line pilots association and to impose about 
50 million in wage and benefit concessions the airline also seeks 
changes in work policies that would allow it to increase pilots 
flying hours 
we dont believe the situation justifies it bruce simon an 
attorney for alpa said in a phone interview friday during a break 
in the negotiating sessions

samuel lek managing director for foreign exchange at bear

returns on dollardenominated investments less attractive thereby

a drierthanexpected forecast for soybeangrowing regions 
evaporated fears of rain and sent soybean prices soaring friday on 
the chicago board of trade 
but the department of agricultures quarterly crop reports 
released after the close of trading friday showed 
higherthanexpected inventories of soybeans corn and especially 
wheat analysts predicted that mondays prices could slide as a 
result 
on other markets cattle prices dipped while pork futures were 
mixed coffee prices rallied energy prices were mixed and precious 
metals closed higher 
a revised forecast deleting rain and calling for dry conditions 
over the next several days sparked the rally in soybeans and corn

trading was light in anticipation of the crop reports which 
showed 465 million bushels of soybeans 3419 billion bushels of 
corn and 694 million bushels of wheat on hand as of june 1 
analysts had estimated the soybean and corn figures would be 
slightly lower but the wheat figure was far above their estimate of 
625 million bushels 
the higher wheat figure indicates a shift in domestic usage 
toward corn and other nonwheat feeds because wheat is overpriced 
said william biedermann vice president and director of research at 
allendale inc a futures brokerage in crystal lake ill 
wheat settled 1 cent to 7 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 397 a bushel corn settled 3 cents to 5 
cents higher with july at 266 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 
cents higher with july at 149 a bushel and soybeans were 10 
cents to 13 cents higher with july at 735 a bushel 
trading in cattle and pork futures at the chicago mercantile 
exchange was light in anticipation of the usdas quarterly 
hogsandpigs report which was released after the close and also 
showed bearish us inventories as of june 1 
the total figure 5550 million was 1 percent lower than a 
year earlier but a million head larger than was expected said 
chuck levitt an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
the figures mean this years hogandpig slaughter into the fall 
will be comparable to last years oppressive levels and likely will 
send prices tumbling on monday levitt said 
live cattle prices settled 62 cent lower to 05 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in august at 7015 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 15 cent to 55 cent lower with august at 8087 cents a 
pound live hogs were 30 cent lower to 45 cent higher with july 
at 4867 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 1 cent lower to 
115 cents higher with july at 3585 cents a pound 
coffee prices rose on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
amid renewed hopes that a collapse of the markets pricesupport 
system can be averted 
the international coffee organization faced with discord among 
its member nations is scheduled to vote monday on differing 
proposals to extend an international pricesupport agreement beyond 
its sept 30 expiration 
in addition the icos executive board has recommended extending 
the pact for two years but abolishing its pricestablizing quota 
machinery which would leave coffee prices after sept 30 subject to 
freemarket forces for the first time since 1963 
however unconfirmed reports indicated that the ico may postpone 
mondays vote which would give members time to resolve their 
differences and come up with a compromise that could leave price 
supports in place analysts said 
that hope sparked fridays rally 
coffee prices settled 50 cent to 325 cents higher with the 
july contract at 11137 a pound 
gold and silver prices on new yorks commodity exchange reversed 
thursdays slide as the dollar weakened and helped ease fears of a 
recession said bette raptopoulous a metals analyst with

subsidiaries tried to sabotage advanced medicals exclusive contract 
to distribute a portable blood analyzer 
the us district court jury awarded a total of 750000 in

the decision by the jury was totally unfounded and we will 
quickly move to have it overturned by the court said robert 
kniffin a johnson amp johnson spokesman we have at all times 
honored our contract with advanced medical and the allegations are 
without foundation 
lee a rosengard a lawyer for advanced medical said that in

negotiate with advanced medical rosengard said

the distributors and johnson amp johnson came out with its own version 
of the blood analyzer which johnson amp johnson professional 
diagnostics began selling in advanced medical territory at a lower 
price

questioned why time management did not allow votes on the 
200ashare paramount bid and the proposed acquisition of warner

and because time stock would not be diluted in a warner buyout

were working 
within all the rules it applies to all companies 
one shareholder anita barishaw of englewood nj complained 
to munro and nicholas the shareholders are nothingwe are not 
consulted on anything

time employees applauded munro and nicholas as the executives 
reiterated their opposition to the paramount bid and support of the 
timewarner deal

directors at the meeting including munro nicholas vice chairman 
jerry levin and outside director donald s perkins

percent of times total common shares outstanding

bid for time june 6 the meeting was rescheduled and time officials

by allowing the timewarner merger to go through

a montana law limiting the damages people 
may collect when wrongfully fired does not deprive employees of 
their rights under the state constitution a divided montana supreme 
court ruled thursday in upholding the law 
a dissenting justice however said the decision clears the way 
for a legislative onslaught against plaintiffs rights in lawsuits 
adding it may be the blackest judicial day in the history of this 
state 
the courts 43 decision may have national implications because 
other states are considering wrongful discharge statutes similar 
to montanas said joel p kelly a los angeles lawyer who 
represented a company that was sued in the montana case 
it upholds the validity of state legislatures authority to 
reform the wrongful discharge area that makes it more likely for 
employers to get behind similar reforms in other states kelly 
said in a telephone interview 
while most states grant employers broad latitude in firing 
workers the montana law says an employee can be fired only for just 
cause 
the law enacted in 1987 says a person who sues an employer for 
wrongful firing cannot collect damages beyond the equivalent of four 
years of wages and benefits and no damages can be awarded for pain 
suffering or emotional distress 
russell e meech fired from his 28000ayear job at park place 
health care center in great falls sued employer hill haven west 
inc of tacoma wash which operates health care facilities in 
several states meech sought punitive as well as actual damages and 
challenged the state law on the basis that it denied his right to 
full legal redress for wrongs suffered 
a state judge in a separate case declared the laws limits on 
damages unconstitutional 
but the high court majority in an opinion by justice russell 
mcdonough said the law does not violate the fundamental right of 
full legal redress because no such fundamental right is created 
by the montana constitution 
while the state constitution says the courts must be available to 
all on an equal basis it does not prevent the legislature from 
devising or specifying particular remedies for wrongs suffered the 
majority said 
wrongs recognized at law are corrected as provided by law 
mcdonough wrote legislatures in the angloamerican system have 
long been held to possess the authority to expand or reduce claims 
and remedies available at common law 
in a blistering dissent justice john c sheehy said the ruling 
cleans the scalpel for the legislature to cut away unrestrainedly 
at the whole field of tort redress perhaps worse the court 
throws in the sponge as a coequal in our tripartite state 
government
