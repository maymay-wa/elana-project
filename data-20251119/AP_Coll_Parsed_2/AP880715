the vice presidency converts respectable 
politicians into champagnesipping wimps and ought to be abolished 
a political scientist says 
william gormley said richard m nixon hubert h humphrey and 
walter mondale were examples of vigorous congressmen who became 
victims of a job that has little authority 
gormley an associate director of the university of wisconsins 
robert m la follette institute of public affairs also said the 
office is outmoded because the founding fathers conceived of the 
vice presidency as an advisory post yet presidents today have 
plenty of advisers he said 
worst of all gormley said is the effect the vice presidency 
has on the people who hold the office 
the vice presidency turns a vigorous robust individual into a 
wimp he said after a few years as vice president even a 
previously vigorous and creative political leader turns into a 
wishywashy mealymouthed sycophant 
vice presidents have always been wimps nixon humphrey and 
mondale were all wimpy vice presidents he said 
in order to do the job as vice president they must play the 
role of a meek and humble servant a presidential loyalist a 
defender of the presidents position he said 
the country could easily turn to the secretary of state or the 
speaker of the house of representatives for a successor if a 
president were to die in office he said 
the secretary of state also could perform many of the vice 
presidents functions he said 
the secretary of state can sip champagne at diplomatic parties 
and look somber and dignified at state funerals gormley said 
the vice president is eminently dispensable

himself police said

as mikhail s gorbachev made his way 
around poland this week he fell further and further behind 
schedule leaving thousands of people who had been invited to see 
him waiting for hours sometimes in vain 
the soviet leader arrived in the western port city of sczcecin 
on wednesday already an hour behind schedule and by the time he 
reached his first scheduled event a speech at a shipyard he was 
two hours late 
polish authorities anxious to ensure all went smoothly for 
their soviet visitor had seated the workers nearly two hours ahead 
of time so when gorbachev finally arrived the 3000 people in the 
audience were squirming after sitting practically silent on 
backless wooden benches for four hours 
organizers of the trip kept adding events to gorbachevs 
schedule including a visit to a private farm on his way to the 
airport to return to warsaw 
it was nearly midnight when the communist party chief arrived 
back in the capital just about four hours late the delay forced 
cancellation of a special chamber music concert that had been 
arranged for gorbachev and his wife raisa in a palace on the 
outskirts of the capital 
although most of the unannounced stops had been arranged in 
advance with staterun television often set up to record the 
events polish government spokesman jerzy urban attributed the 
delays to what he called gorbachevs extraordinary popularity among 
the polish people 
never before he said had a visitor drawn such crowds or 
generated so much spontaneous joy 
but at all those events reporters were permitted to witness the 
crowds were screened in advance and polish security often checked 
peoples invitations against their identification cards before 
permitting them within sight of the soviet leader

americans have indicated they would like to 
see more federal regulation of the 17 billionayear cosmetic 
industry which currently lacks stringent controls an official of 
the food and drug administration says 
heinz j eiermann director of the fdas division of cosmetic 
technology said people are often surprised to learn that 
cosmetics which usually contain chemicals have so few federal 
guidelines 
eiermann made his comments in a telephone interview thursday 
after a house subcommittee heard testimony about the potential 
danger of some of the chemicals in cosmetics 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the small business panel 
said some of the chemicals in cosmetics can cause cancer birth 
defects central nervous disorders skin and eye irritations and 
allergic reactions 
wyden promised to have additional hearings in the fall to weigh 
whether congress should take action to enforce additional testing 
and labeling of cosmetics about 8000 chemicals are used in 
cosmetics and perfume 
he said the fda does not have the authority to test cosmetics 
for safety before they are sold and cannot require manufacturers 
to provide test data on a products safety 
the only actions fda can take are to seize contaminated products 
and to ask manufacturers to change their advertising claims he 
said 
retail products sold to consumers must be labeled as to 
contents but that regulation does not apply to products sold to 
business establishments such as hair styling salons 
eiermann said it is congress responsibility to decide whether 
americans want cosmetics to be subject to the same standards 
applied to food and drugs 
but he said the fda did a food survey in the 1970s and included 
questions about cosmetics there is a preponderance of the 
population they think the products should be regulated he 
said 
results of the study were never published because they were part 
of the broader survey he said 
the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association a group that 
represents the industry said cosmetic companies are committed to 
safety because of this commitment personal care products are 
among the safest of any consumer products and are used confidently 
by millions of persons on a daily basisit said in a statement 
the industry has a program of selfregulation that involves 
testing ingredients the statement said 
beth shulman vice president of the united food and commercial 
workers international union said congress should pass legislation 
requiring that all cosmetic products contain ingredient labels 
secondly she said more studies need to be done to determine 
the longterm effects on people who use the chemicals 
dr james cone chief of the occupational health clinic at san 
francisco general hospital urged congress to take steps to warn 
consumers and beauticians about any possible health hazards in 
cosmetics 
he suggested that products contain detailed labels that clearly 
spell out the nature of any chemicals in the cosmetics and explain 
possible health hazards 
moreover the government should collect better information about 
the chemicals and their effects and remove any that are deemed 
dangerous cone said

the nations largest private television 
stations began limiting coverage of guerrilla violence in a bid to

to combat the rebels 
also thursday maoist rebels from the group known as shining 
path shot to death the city administrator of chincha 120 miles 
south of lima police said 
television coverage of perus eightyear rebel insurgency had 
become a battle ground among stations in ratings wars with some 
channels dedicating up to 15 minutes a night to violent footage 
the accord of a minute was agreed to by lima channels 2 4 
5 and 9 most of the citys stations it calls for the time 
alloted to local news reports of violence held to 60 seconds per 
broadcast 
channel 5 press director carlos paz said the goal of the 
selfimposed pact was to contribute to national pacification 
president alan garcia prolonged a state of emergency for two 
months in the coastal capital of lima and parts of six other states 
in the andes mountains and amazon jungle the announcement was made 
in a decree in the official gazette el peruano 
police said three shining path guerrilla gunmen killed 
administrator mario casas a member of garcias centerleft aprista 
party near his chincha home and escaped before authorities 
arrived the official was leaving home for work 
the assassination was carried out like dozens of others by the 
rebel band against government and party officials 
but most of the more than 10000 people slain during the 
insurgency have been highland peasants caught in the fighting 
between guerrillas and government forces 
the state of emergency was first imposed in highland ayacucho 
two years after the shining path inspired by the late chinese 
leader mao zedong launched its insurgency there in 1980 to topple 
perus elected government and install marxist rule 
a state of emergency suspends citizens rights to meet publicly 
and travel freely while permitting government forces to conduct

pistachio growers mail carriers and freelance 
writers are in for tax breaks under a bill approved by the house 
ways and means committee some farmers moonlighters and pipe 
smokers will help pick up the tab 
after a month of offandon work behind closed doors the 
committee on thursday voted 333 for a package providing 71 
billion in specialized tax relief over the next three years 
because of budget restrictions the bill also carries the tax 
increases to pay for the cuts 
the bill originally was designed solely to correct hundreds of 
errors that showed up in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986 
but since this is the only tax bill with a chance of passing 
congress this year committee members ended up adding numerous 
amendments extending some expiring tax benefits and dozens of 
others providing relief to specialized groups of taxpayers 
for example the bill would allow an 80 percent tax deduction 
for contributions to college athletic scholarship funds when such 
gifts guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket 
because the bill would raise other taxes on some people there 
is enough controversy associated with it to make enactment far less 
than certain for one thing the reagan administration opposes some 
of the increases 
too there is some doubt that sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the senate finance committee will interrupt his vice 
presidential campaign to handle a bill that raises taxes on anybody 
some of the dozens of provisions in the bill would 
allow rural mail carriers to deduct 3375 cents for each mile a 
personal car is driven on a mail route most people are allowed 
just 225 cents a mile for businessrelated mileage 
give certain producers of pistachio nuts a break on how they 
account for production costs 
exempt freelance writers artists and photographers from a new 
requirement that they deduct expenses of an endeavor only after it 
starts producing income 
impose a tax of 267 per pound of pipe tobacco that is 
equivalent to the existing 16centapack tax on cigarettes 
tighten depreciation provisions for singlepurpose farm 
structures such as poultry houses and farm machinery 
prohibit any person with a homebased business including 
moonlighters from deducting any part of the base monthly telephone 
charge as a business expense 
renew at a reduced level the tax exclusion for 
employerprovided educational assistance only 1500 of such aid 
per year could avoid tax down from 5250 
extend several expiring provisions including credits for 
research and experimentation and for owners of lowincome rental 
housing and a tax exemption for bonds used to help lowerincome 
families buy their first home 
relieve farmers from a 1987 requirement that they pay tax on 
offroad diesel fuel and then apply for a refund 
allow owners of mutual fund shares to deduct certain fund 
expenses without regard to the usual 2 percent floor under 
miscellaneous deductions 
remove some tax benefits from singlepremium life insurance 
policies 
raise taxes on various corporations including those that own 
parts of other corporations and defense contractors 
assure that fellowships created to honor the memory of 
challenger astronaut christa mcauliffe are taxfree so long as the 
recipient teacher uses the money for academic improvement 
permit operators of offshore or alaska oil rigs and of some 
commercial vessels but not luxury liners to deduct the full cost 
of meals provided to employees most business may deduct only 80 
percent 
allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on certain profits 
from the sale of a principal home just as though the spouse had 
not died present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after a 
home is sold and before a new one is built

senate republicans say theyll make no 
effort to wage a floor fight for bernard siegan a conservative 
appellate court nominee whose writings were cited as too extreme to 
win democratic backing 
in a vote that had similarities to the rejection last year of 
supreme court nominee robert h bork the democraticled judiciary 
committee voted 86 along party lines thursday to recommend senate 
rejection of siegan 
the professor of constitutional law at the university of san 
diego was president reagans nominee for the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals covering nine western states 
like bork siegan wrote often on the law and like bork his 
views often were contrary to precedents set by the supreme court 
especially on civil rights and civil liberties 
but while senators decided a supreme court nominee deserved a 
full senate vote even siegans supporters said no such effort 
would be made for him 
sen strom thurmond rsc whose motion to report the 
nomination without recommendation failed on a 77 tie said 
afterwards that republicans will make no effort to take it to the 
floor its obvious that its over 
sen orrin g hatch rutah and another siegan supporter agreed 
that there would be no floor fight 
sen dennis deconcini dariz first voted for rejection but 
then sided with the republican norecommendation motion 
sen edward m kennedy dmass who offered the motion to 
reject siegan criticized the nominees almost total lack of 
experience before federal courts he had one case three decades 
ago and said the nominee practiced judicial activism in the 
extreme 
sen arlen specter rpa agreed that siegans writings were 
extreme but voted for him anyway arguing a law professor 
should have freedom to write what he chooses 
specter who opposed bork said he would be more concerned about 
siegans views if he were a supreme court nominee an appellate 
court candidate would have no choice but to follow supreme court 
rulings he said a point siegan made in two confirmation hearings 
siegan wrote that prayer in schools could be constitutional 
although the supreme court has said otherwise he contended that 
equal weight should be given to property rights and human rights 
he said framers of the 14th amendment which guarantees basic 
freedoms never intended its scope to be as broad as that defined 
by the supreme court 
siegan also disagreed with the high courts reasoning in its 
1954 decision outlawing school segregation although he agreed with 
the result 
the landmark ruling siegan said should have been based on the 
right of black students to travel to the schools of their choice 
his critics said this would have left students at the schoolhouse 
door without guaranteeing a seat inside 
siegan 63 was only the second judicial nominee to be rejected 
by the judiciary committee since the democrats regained control in 
january 1987 bork was the first 
although the two men disagreed on some areas of the law both 
wrote often from their positions as law school scholars bork went 
on to become a federal appellate judge although he resigned after 
his defeat for the high court 
siegan after a state court practice went on to become a 
professor his lack of federal court experience was cited by 
democrats opposing him 
he hasnt handled a case since i was 12 years old 36 years 
ago said sen patrick j leahy dvt 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals has jurisdiction over 
alaska arizona california hawaii idaho montana nevada 
oregon washington guam and the northern mariana islands

democrat lloyd bentsen is promising to keep up 
his push for trade legislation even though he expects to spend 
considerable time on the vice presidential campaign trail 
ill be taking some of my time to work on that trade bill here 
in the senate the texan said thursday at a meeting of his senate 
finance committee he said he had talked to governor dukakis on 
that and received approval to keep working on the trade measure 
the measure was approved by the house on wednesday and sent to 
the senate where there could be floor action before midaugust 
the decision by massachusetts gov michael dukakis to tap 
bentsen as his running mate heightens prospects for senate approval 
of the legislation in the view of some democrats 
in related action a legislative blueprint for implementing the 
uscanadian free trade agreement won approval thursday from the 
finance committee the plan also cleared the house house ways and 
means committee 
tariffs between the two nations would be phased out over the 
next 10 years under the agreement 
under special procedures reserved for international trade pacts 
the administration will now introduce implementing legislation that 
follows closely the blueprint drawn up by the two committees 
congress guarantees in turn that the legislation gets speeded up 
consideration with amendments ruled out 
administration officials promised the finance committee that the 
legislation would not include subsidies for the us uranium 
industry which had been delaying action by the two committees 
both bentsen and ways and means committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill balked at the uranium subsidy plan other 
squabbles also were settled and officials said the path appeared 
clear for approval of the agreement and the bill 
weve set an example for the entire world on what can be 
accomplished with free trade bentsen said this is a historic 
moment 
rostenkowski issued a statement saying the lawmakers had 
reached agreement among ourselves and with the administration on 
the details of the implementing legislation 
i believe that this consultative process has developed a 
sound well crafted implementing bill which balances all 
interests he said 
it fully carries out our obligations under the agreement but 
also protects the legitimate intrerests of those few industries 
concerned about possible adverse effects on their current business 
dealings he said

us and soviet teams monitoring compliance 
with the new mediumrange missile treaty have found no violations 
of the pact so far says brig gen roland lajoie head of the 
american inspection contingent 
there have been no difficulties lajoie told reporters at 
the pentagon on thursday lajoie the chief of the us onsite 
inspection agency headed a team on the first round of american 
onsite visits to the soviet union at the beginning of this month 
and was expected to begin the second us round over the weekend 
four soviet teams of 10 people arrived thursday evening aboard a 
special ilyushin62 at dulles international airport and were to 
begin their second round of inspections today or saturday 
the sites the soviets were expected to visit were a martin 
marietta corp plant near baltimore cape canaveral fla the 
redstone arsenal at huntsville ala fort sill okla and 
possibily the longhorn army depot at marshall texas 
although us and soviet inspectors were a little wary at first 
said lajoie the process has gone smoothly since president reagan 
and kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev exchanged articles of 
ratification in moscow on june 1 and the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty went into effect 
during a 60day period of baseline inspections the soviets 
are visiting 30 sites in the united states and western europe and 
lajoie and his team are inspecting 133 sites in the soviet union 
and eastern europe to determine the accuracy of data exchanged by 
the two sides 
under the treaty which calls for elimination of all superpower 
missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3000 miles over about three 
years the soviet union is to destroy about 6000 items consisting 
of missiles and related components and the united states is to 
destroy 2000 items lajoie said 
with inspections about 25 percent complete said lajoie the 
count has been exactly on 
inspectors tend to be congenitally suspicious which is 
probably a healthy attitude he said both sides are wary that 
the other will be concealing or hiding items that has not been the 
case on either side 
the onsite inspectors are confined to strictly defined areas 
and do not have the right to roam through woods or caves looking 
for hidden missiles 
there are other sources that hopefully will give us the 
confidence there is not something in areas inspectors cannot 
visit said lajoie alluding to satellites which take photographs 
and collect electronic intelligence 
it is too early in the life of this treaty to be philosophic 
or to make grand pronouncements he added 
but lajoie who has served twice as military attache in moscow 
and once in berlin said there are some dramatic differences in 
the soviet union from when i was there leaving for the last time 
in 1983 and the relationship i had with the group of soviet forces 
in germany from 83 to 86 
lajoie was in germany in 1985 when soviet soldiers fatally shot 
maj arthur d nicholson while the soldier visited east germany 
and clearly there was a considerable tension in our relationship 
all of that is gone now 
the soviets under severe pressure from the united states 
apologized last month for shooting nicholson

the number of americans who believe in the 
divinity of jesus christ has increased in the last decade but a 
smaller percentage belong to organized churches according to a new 
gallup poll 
the churches of america have made no headway in narrowing the 
gap between religious belief and church involvement between 
believers and belongers said the polling organizations 
cochairman george gallup in previewing the survey results 
thursday 
the nationwide survey called the unchurched american found 
that 84 percent of those surveyed believe christ is either god or 
the son of god compared with 78 percent in a similar 1978 gallup 
poll the number of survey respondents declaring they were 
committed to jesus christ increased from 60 percent to 66 
percent 
fortyfour percent of respondents were classified as 
unchurched because they have not attended regular services in 
six months compared with 40 percent of those polled a decade ago 
the survey projects that 61 million american adults did not 
belong to any church in 1978 with the number increasing to 78 
million today 
while churchgoers tend to have stronger beliefs than those who 
do not attend the survey found considerable faith among the 
unchurched gallup said at a news conference 
the poll showed that 72 percent of those who do not attend 
church believe in christ 77 percent believe in god 63 percent 
believe the bible is inspired 58 percent believe in an afterlife 
and 25 percent say they have had a religious experience 
the 163000 study based on inperson interviews with 2556 
adults was conducted by the gallup organization of princeton 
nj for 22 major religious organizations and is to be distributed 
at a national festival of evangelism in chicago aug 47 
gallup said the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points making the 10year change in results on church 
participation and religious belief statistically significant 
one might maintain that churches have done well to keep 
slippage at a minimum in view of the continued high mobility among 
americans during the last decade the distractions of modern life 
and the apparent growing appeal of cults and nontraditional 
religious movements gallup said 
the percentage of all respondents who said they believe that 
most churches are too concerned with organizational rather than 
spiritual issues has grown from 51 percent in 1978 to 59 percent in 
the new survey and 41 percent said they believe churches are not 
concerned enough about social justice compared to 35 percent in 
the previous survey 
gallup said the survey found more criticism of churches from 
those who attend than those who do not but he did not give 
details complete survey results are to be released at the chicago 
convention 
there was no significant change over the 10year period in the 
view held by more than threefourths of those surveyed that a 
person can be a good christian or jew without attending a church or 
synagogue in both surveys about 80 percent also said they believe 
that a person should arrive at his or her religious beliefs 
independent of any church or synagogue 
paul benjamin executive director of the chicago conference 
said the survey results showed little differences in opinions 
between protestants and catholics he said it was not possible to 
break down the results by denominations because the individual 
samplings were not large enough 
he said religious leaders have yet to analyze the survey results 
but they seem to indicate that while church membership has sagged 
americans are deeply religious and the churches have a tremendous 
opportunity to reach out 
many times we churches are only concerned about our needs and 
become selfcentered and ingrown benjamin said 
the poll interviewed more blacks and hispanics than the 
percentages existing in the general population in order to find if 
there were any significant differences in responses by race gallup 
said 
it found no relationship between race and church status or 
religious values he said but more black respondents said they had 
real religious experiences believed more strongly in personal 
freedom and were critical of churches for inadequate commitment to 
social justice

convention and 2277 to next months republican bash in new orleans 
the survey effort which started with the selection of the first 
michigan republican delegates in january cries out for a summing 
up 
what made you hate surveys how many calls did you get how much 
time did you spend on them whose survey did you like best whose 
least and what was the dumbest question you were asked present 
company excepted 
i think questions about my race religion and sex would be 
illegal if the government asked them said republican delegate 
ben bailey the top aide to west virginia governor arch moore if 
we in government asked those questions they would be considered 
insulting or suspect 
bob douglas handled survey questions for his boss maryland gov 
donald schaefer 
surveys have ranged from one paragraph to what look like fbi 
grand inquisitions was his answer to the survey of surveys the 
longest he said was the los angeles times which spread its 132 
questions over 16 pages and you virtually need a phd and two 
weeks time to answer that survey 
ohio gov richard celeste was asked dukakis strongest point 
his record as governor 
dukakis weakest point 
his record as governor said celeste 
of such stuff are trends discerned 
there must be at least 50 surveys said jacksonville fla 
attorney steve pajcic a dukakis delegate it seems to me there 
is more inefficiency in the media than there is in government 
some people do exaggerate 
there were too many surveys groused john willis maryland 
state democratic party vice chairman you get some that are 15 
and 20 minutes long thats crazy 
bernice covilli 61 of west frankfort ill was bothered by 
the 20 or so interviewers who wouldnt accept her insistence on 
being uncommitted 
whos your choice whos your choice she mimicked 
illinois state representative monique davis a jackson delegate 
was irritated by the whatif questions about vice presidential 
possibilities finally i just told one guy put down jesse 
jackson every time you get to that question 
delegate carmen canino a massachusetts democrat who works for 
the state welfare department was reluctant to answer questions 
then she wasnt crazy about question no 1 her age then she 
wanted to know if the questions had been cleared by the democratic 
party then she hung up 
congressman barney frank of massachusetts accustomed to 
interviews was willing to answer questions until he found out it 
was a survey im not doing any of these he said and hung up 
some delegates it must be said were flattered by the attention 
and said things like thank you for asking my opinion the 
survey of surveys failed to ask whether it was their first 
interview or the 15th 
as for the dumbest question there were several candidates 
how much money i plan to spend in atlanta said james p 
jones a super delegate from virginia 
what was it in atlanta that i wanted to see more than anything 
before i left said monique davis the indomitable jackson 
delegate her reply i told them jesse jackson as the vice 
president or the president

eight years after jimmy carter left the white 
house in defeat and despair his long political exile is coming to 
an end here in his native georgia 
no longer is he shunned by the democratic establishment or 
scorned as the hapless leader who turned over the keys of the white 
house to republican ronald reagan 
with the democratic convention threatened by discord jesse 
jackson turned to carter to mediate his highprofile differences 
with michael dukakis he has earned respect of all of us 
jackson explained 
jackson said he wants carter to play a real role in settling 
the differences he understands the equation jackson said 
carter will deliver an openingnight speech before the 
democratic convention on monday he is hosting receptions for the 
media former cabinet members and other dignitaries 
and the carter presidential center will be the site for many 
conventionrelated activities such as forums on domestic and 
foreign policy issues 
at long last carter is an undisputed elder statesman of the 
party 
democratic chairman paul kirk said americans have changed their 
opinion about carter after eight years of threebyfive cards and 
handsoff government under reagan 
people understand the sincerity and the seriousness of purpose 
and the enlightment of values and views that president carter 
brought to his administration kirk said 
and i think he will be greeted and welcomed at the democratic 
convention as he should be just as a president whose roots were 
planted and nutured here in georgia but who made a great 
contribution to values around the globe kirk said 
those must be sweet words to carter particularly since they 
come from a man who wanted to see sen edward kennedy dmass not 
carter as the democratic nominee for president in 1980 
it hasnt been easy for carter since reagan turned him out of 
office in 1980 humiliating him with a 44state sweep even after 
losing the white house carter remained a favorite target of reagan 
and republicans blamed for the sagging economy and ridiculed by 
george bush for talking about americas malaise 
for a long while carter was remembered as the president who 
left american hostages in iran the leader who authorized a rescue 
attempt that ended in failure in the desert he presided over a 
nation that waited in long lines for gasoline and had to pay 
doubledigit interest rates for loans 
but reagan has had his setbacks too 242 servicemen killed in 
lebanon americans held hostage in lebanon record budget deficits 
the irancontra scandal and most recently the picture of an 
american warship shooting down a civilian airliner over the persian 
gulf killing 290 people 
perhaps these events have softened the republicanpromoted image 
of carter as inept 
on the campaign trail bush certain to be the republican 
presidential nominee is likely to pass over carter and talk about 
mcgovern democrats 
a relationship with carter has proven not to be a political 
liability as evidenced by the election successes of former 
administration members such as carters secretary of 
transportation brock adams who won a senate seat from washington 
state and andrew young former un ambassador who now is mayor of 
atlanta 
though carters name is not frequently invoked by michael 
dukakis all of the democrats who ran for president dukakis 
included made a pilgrimage to georgia to pay respects this year 
carters success is in marked contrast to that of another former 
president richard nixon fourteen years after nixon resigned in 
disgrace he still avoids the republican presidential conventions 
and plays only a backstage role in offering occasional advice to 
reagan and bush

black leaders say it is urgent that democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis heal his rift with jesse 
jackson the man he defeated and they predict next weeks party 
convention could be on the wild and ragged side 
there has to be a real healing process set in motion said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people adding that he would try to play 
a role in reconciling the two sides in atlanta 
im concerned that the black community not feel that in 
snubbing mr jackson gov dukakis has snubbed them hooks said 
up to now the jackson campaign has been healthy for the 
democratic party and i see no reason why it shouldnt continue to 
be healthy said atlanta mayor andrew young 
black members of congress planned a series of meetings for this 
weekend and early next week aimed at reconciling the partys split 
factions sessions were being set first with jackson to develop a 
unified strategy then with dukakis or his top aide paul brountas 
clearly the way jesse jackson was dealt with on a personal 
basis looms as a monumental issue said rep ron dellums 
dcalif it speaks to how black people are perceived in this 
election he is the personification of the hopes of millions of 
people whether mr dukakis understands that or not is something 
that remains to be seen 
dellums said the snub gives the appearance that dukakis is 
courting conservatives who have been fickle to the democratic party 
and taking for granted the black voters who have been its most 
loyal supporters 
several black leaders said they expect the path to 
reconciliation to be rocky and rep gus savage dill vowed to 
stage several protests including a monday march from the grave of 
slain civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr to the omni 
convention center 
i think theres going to be a lot of confusion down in 
atlanta a lot of pain down there dellums said 
added hooks it will be a little on the wild and ragged side 
but well leave there together 
jackson and his supporters were stung by dukakis selection of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen for the vice presidential spot on the 
democratic ticket and the hurt was compounded when jackson first 
learned about the choice from reporters rather than directly from 
dukakis 
dukakis telephoned jackson on wednesday to try to mend the 
damage and jackson said thursday he had asked former president 
jimmy carter to mediate between the two camps jackson also said he 
got an apology from a top dukakis aide but no apology from dukakis 
he said he wasnt seeking one though 
the lawmakers said their concerns extended beyond the personal 
tiff to the appearance that issues of concern to blacks were being 
given short shrift 
we are trying to salvage this said rep mervyn dymally 
chairman of the congressional black caucus acknowledging that 
there is a wide range of intensity about the matter among the 23 
black house members who make up the caucus we are practical 
politicians 
some caucus members said they recognized the danger to their 
political standing if jackson appears to be going to the convention 
purely as a spoiler and young hinted that jackson should be ready 
to compromise 
this party has elected michael dukakis as its nominee young 
said his primary responsibility is to bring victory he cant do 
anything for jesse jackson or for me or the cities unless he wins 
election 
the black caucus was working through rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass to set up meetings with the dukakis camp and mavroules 
said he expected there to be a lengthy meeting perhaps on tuesday 
i think it would be a very wise idea on the part of the 
dukakis people mavroules said they can talk at length about 
problems about issues and if they want they can talk about the 
jackson thing i would like very much if we could have a nice 
good normal united convention 
mavroules said the members of the congressional black caucus 
play a very key role we need them with us i think most of them 
want this settled

president reagan back from a look at what he 
called the worst natural disaster since the dust bowl is 
sending a team headed by secretary of agriculture richard lyng on a 
tour of 11 droughtstricken states from tennessee to the dakotas 
reagan inspected corn and soybean fields in southern illinois on 
thursday and appealed to congress to focus its attention on drought 
relief putting aside partisanship and efforts to rewrite the 
overall farm laws 
politics must stop at the parched fields edge reagan said 
in davenport iowa paraphrasing a traditional foreign policy 
slogan that partisanship should stop at the waters edge 
the president spoke at a luncheon in davenport after inspecting 
crop damage at the du quoin state fair grounds and the nearby farm 
of herman krone near marion ill 
we should keep our eye on the ball he told the luncheon 
audience drought relief should be just that drought relief 
both in davenport and at the fair grounds reagan urged the 
lawmakers to avoid amendments not relevant to the drought crisis 
what i saw was not a pretty sight reagan said after walking 
through the shriveled fields and viewing them from a helicopter 
we cant make it rain but we can help to ease the pain and 
thats what the federal government will do he told state 
agriculture officials and farmers gathered at the fair grounds 
from montana to texas from california to georgia and right 
here in illinois farmers face the worst natural disaster since the 
dust bowl of the 1930s the president said 
on air force one flying back to washington lyng said he and his 
task force plan to visit 11 states beginning next tuesday he 
listed ohio indiana tennessee missouri iowa oklahoma north 
dakota south dakota minnesota michigan and wisconsin he said he 
would be accompanied by representatives of the interior department 
army corps of engineers and several other agencies 
meanwhile in washington the senate agriculture committee 
approved a 55 billion drought relief bill after adopting 10 
amendments the corresponding committee of the house is considering 
a similar bill 
lyng told reporters that the senate bill appeared to be pretty 
close to the package weve been talking about 
in davenport reagan spoke at a luncheon sponsored by radio 
station woc and the local chamber of commerce after taking part in 
65th anniversary observances of the station where he began his 
entertainment career as an announcer in the 1930s 
in an interview with woc reagan said he is waiting for the farm 
relief bill i will sign it the minute it is delivered to me

nobody really expected jesse jackson to go gently 
into the campaign to win the white house for michael dukakis 
and jacksons grievances against the democrat who defeated him 
were inevitable for jackson its too soon to have them settled 
without his complaints notably dukakis failure to give him 
advance word that sen lloyd bentsen would be the democratic vice 
presidential nominee there would be nothing but symbolism to keep 
the campaign going 
and jackson has gone far beyond symbolism in his second campaign 
for the presidency 
in defeat jackson has risen higher in the realm of presidential 
politics than any black man before him he is not ready to end his 
campaign quite yet 
so as his convention cavalcade rolls from chicago to atlanta on 
a final campaign bus tour he is demanding a clear and influential 
role in the campaign and in the councils of the democratic party 
dukakis says hell have one i want jesse jackson to be deeply 
involved in the campaign as a party leader the massachusetts 
governor said i hope and expect that he will be 
neither has defined the precise nature of the role or the deep 
involvement precision is difficult if not impossible anyhow 
jackson says he is not satisfied we are prepared to 
deliberate and debate tuesday wednesday and thursday he said 
accounting for all the business sessions of the democratic national 
convention 
lacking the vice presidential slights he isnt it and he 
wasnt told of bentsen jackson would have had to find other 
issues for debate or lapse into silence which is not his way 
now hes even involving innocent bystanders as in the 
suggestion that former president jimmy carter mediate his 
differences with dukakis carter declined to comment on that notion 
the eventual settlement will be the drama of the democratic 
national convention opening monday with all its decisions made in 
advance debate is one thing delegates are another dukakis has 
more than 2500 to jacksons 1150 any time delegates vote 
dukakis is in control jacksons claim that the floor will be 
wide open on a vice presidential nomination simply isnt so on 
any item of business 
but dukakis needs to claim his victory and enforce his decisions 
without alienating the jackson forces doubly difficult and also 
crucial because he is dealing with a black leader and a 
predominantly black constituency 
presently i do not know the proposed strategy to win 
jackson said in chicago on thursday at this point my 
constituency has no place on the team 
that constituency cannot be turned on and off at will not even 
by jacksons command this time the unity show that is the 
traditional convention finale will have to be built on a base more 
substantive than handshakes and victory waves 
jacksons supporters are echoing and escalating the complaint 
that he heard from dukakis on the bentsen choice only after it had 
been made public 
it speaks to the way black people are perceived in this 
election said rep ron dellums dcalif whether mr dukakis 
understands that or not is something that remains to be seen 
dukakis said he was sorry he hadnt been able to contact 
everybody in advance and noted that he had not reached ohio sen 
john glenn either he has talked with jackson by telephone at 
least twice since announcing the bentsen selection 
the nomineeinwaiting is trying to be conciliatory without 
appearing to surrender control of the convention and the party he 
now leads he needs jacksons help and jackson needs a continuing 
role in the 1988 campaign 
this is after all only the preliminary the real prize will be 
awarded on nov 8 dukakis versus vice president george bush 
the real test of whatever reconciliation dukakis and jackson 
reach wont come in atlanta it will come in the campaign months 
that follow

state budget problems are dogging michael dukakis 
in the days before he travels to the democratic national convention 
to receive his partys presidential nomination 
while most of his headquarters campaign staff made a wholesale 
move to the convention site in atlanta on thursday dukakis spent 
most of the day in a search for ways to deal with deficits in 
budgets for the current and past fiscal years 
the governor and his fellow democrats who dominate the state 
legislature were determined to resolve the budget problems before 
dukakis heads for atlanta on sunday and deny republicans an 
opportunity to attack the democratic candidates claim to be an 
efficient manager 
the atlanta express is rolling massachusetts house gop 
leader steven pierce said during the legislative budget debate 
you democrats want out of here you dont care what happens to 
the budget 
vice president george bush who has clinched the republican 
presidential nomination already has attacked dukakis for approving 
more than 100 million in new taxes as part of a budgetbalancing 
plan 
while dukakis was trying to clear his desk of state problems he 
also was confronted by threats to his goal of a party convention 
that will reflect party unity 
jesse jackson saying i simply want respect and 
responsibility suggested that former president jimmy carter step 
in and mediate differences between the dukakis and jackson camps 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan asked about jacksons call for 
mediation said only that the two sides had been talking throughout 
the campaign and would keep doing so 
in atlanta carter spokesman carrie harmon confirmed that carter 
had spoken with jackson by telephone but would not comment on 
whether he would get involved in any mediation effort 
both dukakis and his aides minimized the prospect that jacksons 
displeasure over the handling of dukakis selection of texas sen 
lloyd bentsen as his running mate would endanger party unity 
but as he left chicago on a bus caravan for atlanta jackson 
refused to rule out the possibility of a convention challenge to 
the choice of bentsen 
later however after his caravan arrived in indianapolis 
jackson said we hope in the next three or four days that matters 
will be resolved 
and dukakis asked during a cbs interview if he expected a 
display of unity in atlanta that would include jackson said i 
expect that you will 
democratic conventions seldom begin on a note of unity said 
senior dukakis campaign aide kirk odonnell but in recent years 
they have ended on one 
dukakis as he has done in the past took a tough line toward 
jacksons complaints about his vice presidential selection process 
obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody 
loses and im the guy whos won and its my job to go out and pick 
a running mate he said in the cbs interview 
jackson complained that he wasnt notified in advance of the 
selection of bentsen and learned of it from a reporter 
mark gearan a dukakis spokesman said the nomineetobe called 
jackson on wednesday the governor obviously made it clear that 
it was his own intention for the reverend jackson and all of the 
candidates to hear the news from no one else but the governor he 
said 
gearan declined to say whether the governor had apologized 
jackson spokesman ron brown termed dukakis gesture an 
important call and a good start toward healing relations but 
made it clear he expects there will be a number of conversations 
between the two men in the days ahead 
dukakis only public foray outside the statehouse on thursday 
was a visit to two state troppers recovering from gunshot wounds 
suffered in a drug raid 
outside boston city hospital dukakis using a police cruiser as 
a table signed legislation toughening sentences for people 
convicted of possession of cocaine 
were serious about a war on drugs in this state said the 
governor sounding a familiar campaign theme

george bush is satisfied with his appearance 
before the un security council on the accidental us downing of an 
iranian airliner in the persian gulf but aides are reluctant to 
say whether he will reap political advantage 
but while bush and his supporters insist that political 
considerations did not figure in his thursday appearance the 
assignment did provide the vice president with a highprofile forum 
any time you can go and speak forcefully about bringing peace 
to this part of the world its worth doing said bush chief of 
staff craig fuller he didnt do it for political reasons i do 
not believe it will be harmful politically 
after an angry 1hour denunciation of the united states by 
iranian foreign minister aliakbar velayati for barbaric acts 
bush told the world organization the united states felt grief for 
the loss of innocent lives that transcends political differences 
and boundaries 
but he also condemned iran for allowing a civilian airliner 
carrying 290 people to proceed on a path over a warship engaged 
in battle and said iran must share responsibility for the tragedy 
coming days before democrats convene in atlanta to install 
michael dukakis as their presidential nominee bushs appearance 
gave him high visibility in an area that he is presenting as one of 
his strong suits foreign policy 
still it was the first time that bush had been selected to 
address the security council in his 7 years as vice president 
even though he served there as us ambassador under president 
richard nixon in the early 1970s 
bush told reporters president reagan had decided to give him the 
assignment to put some real emphasis on the policy of the united 
states by elevating the level of representation 
theres so much at stake im not sure people have a heart for 
talking about how it helps him politically said campaign press 
secretary sheila tate this was serious business it wasnt 
politics 
bush more subdued in his un presentation than he has been in 
recent public appearances when he characterized the july 3 disaster 
as just an unhappy incident while telling audiences that life 
goes on 
departing from his prepared text bush turned to face velayati 
across the semicircular council table speaking in a calm voice 
the vice president said of course we feel badly about it of 
course we have compassion of course we care 
aides said that bushs presentation was written by three or four 
white house speechwriters with most of the ideas for its wording 
coming from him the text was coordinated with both the state 
department and the national security council before bush delivered 
it the aides said 
fuller his chief of staff would not confirm speculation that 
bush himself had proposed the assignment to reagan saying only 
that he and reagan had worked out the arrangements 
fuller told reporters on air force ii after bushs appearance 
that the vice president feels very good about the way his 
20minute address to the world forum came across 
it was bushs last scheduled public appearance until next 
wednesday when he begins a sixday campaign swing 
he has no public events planned for today and on saturday he 
leaves for a 4day fishing trip at a remote undisclosed location 
in wyoming with treasury secretary james a baker iii a close 
friend and adviser 
bush on thursday also gave his first public reaction to the 
naming by dukakis as former rival sen lloyd bentsen as his running 
mate beyond a cryptic thats interesting on the day of the 
announcement 
he called the selection of bentsen an unusual choice but 
told reporters aboard air force two he did not think it would hurt 
him politically even in his adopted state of texas bentsen 
defeated bush in a 1970 senate race 
asked if the selection would make him campaign harder for texas 
29 electoral votes bush said i dont know i certainly wont 
lighten up 
i plan to spend a lot of time in texas anyway i am certainly 
not going to take texas for granted and i will win texas 
the race is going to be determined as i said in 1980 and as i 
said in 1984 by the top of the ticket thats what will determine 
it in texas and elsewhere

sen lloyd bentsen is predicting that he and 
michael dukakis will triumph over republican george bush this fall 
in the vice presidents adopted home state of texas but hes not 
claiming it will be easy 
i think it will be close i think it will be tough but i 
think well win it the texas senator said thursday 
vamos a ver he said spanish for were going to see 
one new poll suggested that dukakis choice of bentsen as his 
running mate went down well with texans dukakis pulled even with 
bush in the state after picking bentsen cbs news reported thursday 
night 
its poll of 580 registered voters on tuesday and wednesday found 
48 percent supporting dukakis to 44 percent for bush with a margin 
of error of four percentage points that is statistically a dead 
hea 
polls that were taken before dukakis picked bentsen had found a 
big bush lead in texas 
bentsen deferred to his new political partner on thursday on the 
matter of mending the rift with jesse jackson who had lobbied for 
the vice presidential nomination 
i know he dukakis has a high regard for reverend jackson i 
assume hell have a meeting with jackson bentsen said in a 
session with reporters from his home state 
bentsen said he believed he was chosen as dukakis running mate 
because of his legislative experience which exposes you to so 
many facets of this country of ours his proven ability to work 
with congress and his exposure through the years to various heads 
of state 
a senator since 1970 bentsen is being opposed in his 
reelection bid this year by rep beau boulter a republican who 
has been fighting an uphill battle in the race bentsen is legally 
allowed to run for both races under a law passed in texas that 
allowed lyndon b johnson to run for vice president with john f 
kennedy as well as the senate 
bentsen could remove his name from the senate ballot before 
sept 6 but the democrats could not replace him boulter says 
bentsens dual candidacy is unethical 
if bentsen wins both elections he would have to choose one post 
or the other if he gave up his senate seat as expected 
republican gov bill clements would name an interim senator and 
then call a special election to pick someone to complete the 
sixyear term 
already texas politicians were moving to stake out a possible 
candidacy in the event of such a special election 
lt gov bill hobby said he would certainly seriously 
consider running if such a special election takes place state 
agriculture commissioner john hightower also said hed consider a 
senate race hightower already had been looking at a 1990 race 
against republican sen phil gramm 
among other democrats looking to enter the fray are former gov 
mark white and reps mike andrews and mickey leland both of 
houston and john bryant of dallas attorney general jim mattox 
also has expressed interest 
on the republican side reps jack fields of houston and steve 
bartlett of dallas have shown interest 
the 1961 special election to replace johnson in the senate drew 
more than 70 candidates republican john tower won

the us army corps of engineers says it 
turned down a request for emergency diversion of great lakes water 
to the droughtdepleted mississippi river because the action would 
do little to help shipping 
the decision was based on analysis of water flow and economic 
considerations said robert page the armys assistant secretary 
for civil works after testifying thursday before the senate 
merchant marine subcommittee it was not politically motivated 
page said 
illinois gov james thompson and other officials whose states 
have an economic stake in the mississippi asked last month for an 
increase in water flow from the lakes to the river from 3000 cubic 
feet per second to 10000 cubic feet per second 
they asked that the increased flow continue for 100 days 
the officials said increasing the flow would enable barge 
traffic to resume movement down the mississippi the rivers level 
has fallen because of the drought and some 3000 barges were 
reported stranded as a result 
barge shippers have estimated losses as a result of the stalled 
shipping at up to 60 million 
but page said increasing the outflow to 10000 cubic feet per 
second would not do much to help mississippi navigation and shoals 
would continue to impede the flow of goods 
we will still have flow on the mississippi through the 
summer he said we see in the foreseeable future based on our 
forecast we dont need increased diversion at all 
don vonnahme director of water resources for the illinois 
department of transportation said the agency had no problems with 
the decision 
if they feel the waters wouldnt do any good then we 
certainly wouldnt want to take them out of the lake he said 
great lakes state senators praised the decision 
the corps position gives us more ammunition in the continuing 
struggle to prevent any diversion said sen carl levin a 
michigan democrat i have maintained that we should explore 
alternatives to diversion such as lightening the loads on barges 
or utilizing truck or rail for transporting goods 
sen donald riegle a michigan democrat said this decision 
will let us protect our water conserve it and use it in the 
proper ways in the future 
the governors of four great lakes states opposed the diversion 
and only thompson supported it among the leaders of the eight 
states surrounding the lakes canadian officials also protested the 
proposed diversion 
supporters of diversion argued the increased flow out of the 
lakes would have a minuscule impact on the great lakes but would 
have great benefits downriver 
opponents argued that the lakes water was needed in the midwest 
and northeast increasing diversion would set an unacceptable 
precedent and the federal government could not increase diversion 
without the concurrence of all eight governors of great lakes 
states

president reagan appears all but certain to 
sign a disaster bill containing payments of up to 100000 for 
droughtstricken farmers the senate agriculture committee chairman 
says 
the prospects are virtual certitude that there will be a 
drought bill sen patrick j leahy dvt said thursday after 
the committee approved a blueprint that could cost up to 7 billion 
or even more 
we assured the president that we would stay within the budget 
and we will leahy said 
reagan said after touring droughtstricken illinois cornfields 
with gov james r thompson that he was a little edgy about 
proposed amendments that flooded into the agriculture committees 
wednesday night but he said he stood ready to approve the basic 
legislation 
i will sign it the minute it is delivered to me reagan said 
in an interview on radio station woc in davenport iowa he said in 
a speech that lawmakers should not use the bill as an excuse to 
rewrite farm programs 
drought relief should be just that drought relief reagan 
said partisanship should be kept out of the issue of drought 
relief politics must stop at the parched fields edge 
the government meanwhile declared ohio and missouri disaster 
areas because of the drought making farmers in those states 
eligible for emergency lowinterest loans officials from both 
states said 
thomas dayley spokesman for the agriculture department said 
the disaster designation had been requested by the governors of the 
two states 
other states logged as of thursday for official designation 
were alabama arizona arkansas california florida idaho iowa 
minnesota montana new york south dakota tennessee and texas 
in washington leahy and sen richard g lugar rind said at 
a news conference that bestguess estimates placed the cost of aid 
to crop growers at around 55 billion and to livestock producers 
at 1 billion to 15 billion 
overall drought costs however could be considerably higher 
than that with farm analysts saying the cost of an avalanche of 
federal crop insurance claims alone could reach 1 billion 
the bill would provide farmers with disaster payments capped at 
100000 for 65 percent of predrought expected earnings on crop 
losses in excess of 35 percent of their historical yields 
and both committees are studying ways to enrich the formula a 
bit for the hardest hit farmers in the grain belt 
in putting on the finishing touches senators added special 
provisions that could aid key industries 
one such plan would allow corn refiners who produce ethanol fuel 
to buy corn from federal stocks at 110 percent of the governments 
cost of acquisition influenced by drought crop prices have 
skyrocketed since much of the corn was acquired under the bill 
ethanol producers could buy up to 2 million bushels each every 
month 
senators said the bills costs could be offset by government 
savings primarily a reduction in deficiency payments due to the 
drought 
these payments to growers of wheat corn cotton rice and a few 
other crops represent the difference between the value of a 
farmers harvest at the market and its value at a socalled target 
price set by congress 
the budget calls for 17 billion in spending by the 
governmentowned commodity credit corp for deficiency payments and 
pricesupport loans 
but the market price of corn is now more than the target price 
and that would automatically mean a dramatic slash in program costs 
the market prices held for the rest of the year even if not 
though the cost to the government is going to be much smaller than 
expected estimates of the savings range from 5 billion to 10 
billion 
many farmers however already have received up to 40 percent of 
their deficiency payments in advance and unless rescued by 
legislation will have to refund all or part at a time when they 
have much reduced income the bill would allow them to keep what 
they have received in advance 
emergency feed programs for livestock producers would be 
expanded and capped at 50000 for each individual and a planned 
50cent per hundredweight cut in dairy price supports set for next 
year would be called off

the construction crews are still at work but the 
hall where michael dukakis will claim his democratic presidential 
nomination next week is complete enough for party officials to 
begin to breathe easier 
easy enough anyway to feel assured the whole thing will be in 
place by mondays opening gavel and easy enough to bring the 
construction workers into the delegates chairs thursday for a 
little ceremonial ribboncutting 
when youre at home watching this convention having a bud or 
whatever have one for us democratic party chief paul kirk told 
the assembled workers who were treated to plasticwrapped 
sandwiches on the floor of atlantas omni coliseum 
dont take for granted it was just another days work he 
said its a page in history 
the towering walls of podiums risers camera platforms and 
network studios inside what is otherwise home for the atlanta hawks 
basketball team are impressive but the builtin features are so 
big that the hall itself cramped anyway by arena standards 
seems amazingly small 
in fact the convention floor isnt big enough more than half 
the 4212 delegates will be in bleachers halfway up the side of the 
arena 
the inside of the hall looks like nothing if not a television 
set that is basically what it is 
i approached it from that standpoint said rene lagler a 
california television set designer who planned the convention 
interior 
lagler also came up with the color scheme he says its red 
white and blue but to others it looks like pink gray and pale 
blue colors that the party officials say will look less harsh on 
television screens 
on camera the whole thing will look red white and blue he 
said just squint thats what it will look like on television 
some squinters however found the colors remained pink gray 
and pale blue 
kirk and atlanta mayor andrew young showed off the fancy 
moveable podium sections they are controlled with hydraulic lifts 
by a stage manager who will sit behind the speakers and adjust to 
compensate for the speakers height nomineetobe dukakis is five 
foot eight 
overhead lights swiveled by remote control as they will when 
the convention begins and canned music poured from giant speakers 
that were sniffed by bombdetecting dogs before they were lifted 
overhead for delegates in seats so remote they cant see giant 
television screens will provide a view 
mike mccurry the conventions director of communications said 
that while all looks pretty close to completion there are constant 
demands for adjustments 
i walked in here yesterday and thought my lord theyre not 
going to be ready mccurry said but theyve done a lot in two 
days 
even as the ribbon was cut however television microwave 
receivers were still being installed above studio skyboxes that 
allow anchor people to look down on the whole spectacle there was 
a din of resumed hammering and sawing 
a workman in shorts scaled a rope ladder and crawled along a 
suspension system near the 12storyhigh ceiling adjusting the 
focus of lights to please technicians below 
just off the floor is the hawks office where general manager 
stan kasten declared the hall unrecognizable its amazing he 
said 
most of the 13500 or so journalists wont even get in the hall 
or will only part of the time theyre being accommodated in the 
vast georgia world congress center dubbed the media village 
theres plenty of room but its across the street from where the 
action is 
outside scores of satellite uplink trucks were being put in 
place their dish antennas pointed skyward theres a mobilehome 
village of network equipment and the handful of trailers the 
dukakis and jackson campaigns each will use as command posts 
back inside lagler was looking over his labors when one of his 
hardhatted workers came up with a question when was the meeting 
to discuss tearing it all down after thursday night 
thatll be another problem lagler said getting all this 
out of here

south korea called friday for student 
exchange visits with communist north korea to help ease tension and 
establish relations but the north refused to accept the proposal 
education minister kim youngshik proposed an exchange visit and 
pilgrimage in which about 1000 students from each nation would 
march across the others territory to promote peace 
it would help restore a sense of national trust and identity 
among the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateral 
nation exchanges kim said in a nationally broadcast speech 
south korean officials who spoke on condition of not being 
identified said the north korean government refused thursday night 
to agree to receive a letter on friday outlining the student 
exchanges the north said the plan was pointless they said 
president roh taewoo of south korea on july 7 unveiled a plan 
to end the confrontation between the prowestern south and the 
communist north by broad political trade cultural and 
humanitarian exchanges roh said the plan could lead to eventual 
peaceful reunification 
but north korea rejected the roh proposal as pointless this 
is nothing new and not worth examination north korea said in a 
july 11 statement 
the two koreas have no relations and the border is sealed the 
two nations technically are still at war since no peace treaty was 
signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 
both governments say they want reunfication but on their terms 
each side insists it is the only legitimate korean government and 
most observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations 
the education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by the 
end of july on a plan to allow about 1000 students from each 
nation to march sometime this year roh had said in june that he 
would call for student exchange visits with the north 
north korea has said no need exists for government involvement 
and student exchanges and meetings should be independent its 
position is designed to support radicals in the south even though 
any north korean student delegation would be under strict communist 
party control 
south korean students would march from the border across north 
korea to mount paektu on the chinese border north korean students 
would march across the south to mount halla on the southern island 
of cheju 
the march could clear the way for sports events between colleges 
in the north and south involving about 200 students kim said the 
first sports event would be in pyongyang in october followed by a 
second sports meet in seoul next april he said 
if the first exchanges are a success kim said they could be 
expanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by students 
from both nations 
the roh government issued the call for improved relations after 
south korean radical students demanded immediate reunification the 
government used riot police to stop thousands of students marching 
to the border june 10 for talks with north korean student delegates 
rohs administration was caught offguard on the issue as people 
debated reunification it has since attempted to catch up on the 
issue 
but rohs proposals were similar or identical to past iniatives 
by both governments since 1971 on improving relations all failed 
to produce results the two koreas arranged smallscale family 
reunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985 
north korea which has staged a number of attacks on the south 
over the years is demanding to act as cohost at the olympic games 
in seoul this september olympic authorities rejected the demand 
and the north said it will boycott the games 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by us and soviet 
forces that ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war 
ii the north invaded the south in 1950 and set off the threeyear 
korean war the united states and other nations fought for the 
south under the united nations flag opposed later in the conflict 
by chinese forces

many parents incorrectly assume its safe to 
leave babies older than 9 months alone in the bathtub says a study 
that found old people and children face a similar risk of drowning 
in tubs and swimming pools 
doctors should remind parents that the bathtub is still a 
potentially lethal place and that the child should not be left 
alone even for brief periods the researchers wrote in todays 
issue of the journal of the american medical association 
were recommending parents just let the phone or doorbell 
ring or wrap the child in a towel and take them with them said 
study coauthor dr ellen alkon a pediatrician at the los angeles 
county department of health services 
researchers also found that 89 percent of all los angeles county 
drowning victims age 2 to 3 died in private swimming pools they 
said that figure underscores the hazard of pools without 
selflatching fences and pools where house walls with doors serve 
as one side of the fence 
more surprising is that we may not have appreciated it isnt 
just toddlers and infants for whom swimming pools and bathtubs are 
a hazard said dr patrick w ocarroll an epidemiologist at the 
national centers for disease control these represent potential 
drowning sites for the elderly 
ocarroll conducted the study with alkon the countys medical 
director for public health programs and billie weiss a county 
epidemiologist they analyzed coroners records of 1587 drowning 
deaths in los angeles county from 1976 through 1984 
the study found that 445 percent of the drownings occurred in 
private pools and 156 percent in bathtubs 
but among children who drowned before age 2 55 percent died in 
private pools and 25 percent in bathtubs among people who drowned 
after their 70th birthday 50 percent died in private pools and 36 
percent in bathtubs 
it was a surprise said alkon it does suggest that maybe 
the elderly should think about having somebody around when theyre 
swimming and perhaps when bathing 
a review of death certificates from the two years covered by the 
study found that of bathtub drowning victims younger than 2 none 
were younger than 9 months 
parents begin to think its safe at about 9 months and it 
clearly isnt alkon said 
about 5300 people drown annually in the united states and 
there are up to three times as many neardrownings ocarroll said 
by phone from atlanta 
onethird of neardrownings result in moderate to severe brain 
damage dr james orlowski of cleveland wrote in an accompanying 
editorial which said pool deaths have made drowning an accident 
of affluence 
alkon and ocarroll said los angeles countys drowning rate is 
lower than the national average probably because the county has 
relatively few lakes and rivers county and national rates have 
dropped in recent years for unknown reasons they said 
ocarroll blamed los angeles countys inadequate enforcement of 
poolfencing laws its warm climate and numerous pools for the fact 
that 445 percent of its drownings occurred in pools 4 times the 
national average alkon said enforcement has been much more 
vigorous since 1984 
the study shows drowning prevention programs must focus on the 
pattern of drowning in each local area ocarroll said for 
example los angeles countys high proportion of pool drownings 
contrasts with studies showing 70 percent of drownings in georgia 
maryland and new mexico occur in lakes rivers and other freshwater 
bodies he said 
in addition to the 156 percent of county drownings in bathtubs 
17 percent occurred in the ocean 11 percent in freshwater lakes or 
streams 38 percent in public pools 21 percent in reservoirs 2 
percent in hot tubs and 4 percent in other sites including basins 
and toilets

a cabinet minister was hit by a rock thursday 
when his car was stoned as he drove through the israelioccupied 
west bank where the army imposed or mantained curfews on several 
towns and refugee camps 
the military administration in the west bank meanwhile ordered 
closed all eight palestinian schools in qalqiliya and 15 schools in 
nearby tulkarem until the end of the school year following student 
riots the army said 
the army reopened 800 west bank schools on monday for the first 
time in a week the schools were closed because the army views them 
as a focal point of the 7monthold palestinian uprising in which 
222 palestinians and four israelis have died 
yosef shapiro a minister without portfolio said on israel 
radio that when his car was stoned near hebron one stone went 
inside and hit me but we are strong people and therefore we threw 
out the stone and continued to drive 
he said it was the third time his car came under palestinian 
attack in the occupied lands 
i think that the government could have done more original and 
aggressive things and in time so we would not witness these riots 
for such a long time the rightwing minister added 
the army clamped a curfew on ein yabrud near ramallah in the 
west bank after a student protest broke out in the village israel 
radio reported 
it said anabta and beit sahur villages the western part of 
nablus the west banks largest city and askar and aida refugee 
camps were also under curfew 
the army also imposed a curfew on qalqiliya where a 12yearold 
boy from the jewish settlement ginot shomron was struck in the head 
by a rock wednesday night the boy was uncsoncious for hours but 
was reported in good condition thursday 
dozens of enraged jewish settlers tried to enter qalqiliya after 
the attack but were turned away by soldiers the army said the 
army was investigating reports that windows of three arabowned 
cars there were smashed 
leaders of the palestinian uprising have called on residents of 
the occupied territories which were taken by israel from jordan 
and egypt in the 1967 sixday war to give palestinian schools 
nationalistic names 
in the biblical west bank city of bethlehem the nativity school 
became palestinian eagles school and bethlehem school is now called 
palestinian revolution school 
in east jerusalem police arrested a 16yearold arab caught 
throwing an empty bottle at an israeli bus one of about six such 
incidents in the city thursday morning no one was hurt a police 
spokesman said 
in central israel a small bomb apparently planted by 
palestinian militants exploded just outside tel aviv university 
but caused no casualties or damage police said 
in haifa a district court sentenced an israeli arab ali nasser 
of araba village to 15 months in prison and 18 months suspended 
sentence after finding him guilty of erecting a roadblock and 
raising outlawed flags of the palestine liberation organization 
police in beirut lebanon said moslem guerrillas fired nine 
rockets into an israeli military outpost near marjeyoun in south 
lebanon before dawn on thursday they said the attack was in the 
eastern sector of israels selfproclaimed security zone but that 
no casualty report was available 
the police said that hours later about 40 israeli troops in 
seven armored personnel carriers advanced into jabal aldahr a 
mountainous area north of the security zone and strafed the area 
with machinegun fire 
they said three guerrillas were killed wednesday when israeli 
soldiers and allied lebanese militiamen of the south lebanon army 
clashed with hezbollah fighters in libbaya two miles from jabal 
aldahr 
the police said mohammed bjaiji commander of the proiranian 
shiite moslem hezbollah organization in southeast lebanon was 
among those killed 
israel said it lost one soldier in the searchanddestroy 
mission wednesday

the persistent veterans peace 
convoy went through one mexican customs station thursday after 
crossing the rio grande with 14 trucks and a school bus in defiance 
of a us trade embargo with nicaragua 
theyre on their way south said tom hansen a spokesman for 
the group that opposes us policies toward nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government 
convoy members were later delayed for a time at a secondary 
customs area after mexican authorities discovered firecrackers in 
one of the vehicles an official said 
the firecrackers which were left over from the fourth of july 
were disposed of and werent the main cause of the delay said 
juanita singer a convoy spokeswoman in laredo texas 
convoy organizers spent much of the day arranging for escorts to 
accompany the trucks to the guatemala border which are required of 
any imports being taken through mexico in unsealed trucks she 
said nonconvoy trucks passing through the customs station also 
were required to arrange for escorts she added 
the convoy paid about 650 for two guards thursday evening and 
headed for saltillo mexico about 3 hours away 
on at least three separate occasions the us treasury 
department has blocked the groups trucks from leaving the united 
states contending that taking the vehicles to nicaragua would 
violate a 3yearold trade embargo 
the government maintains the food and medical supplies qualify 
as humanitarian aid exempt from the nicaraguan trade control 
regulations but that the vehicles are not humanitarian aid convoy 
members disagree 
eight convoyistas were arrested saturday in a tense 
confrontation with us customs officials border patrol agents and 
laredo police after customs refused to let the convoy cross the 
border 
one of the eight was rearrested early monday and charged with 
blocking traffic at the same bridge when customs again refused to 
let him cross 
later monday however the group said it started crossing 
vehicles and finally drove the last one across wednesday the group 
said the first 11 passed without question while the last four were 
told to provide personal and vehicle identification 
a very funny thing that happened was that different officials 
police and border and treasury officials ran into us in laredo and 
different places and advised us to go one at a time late at 
night said convoy spokesman jay singer and so we tried it and 
it worked 
they mace us they arrest us they break our windows they 
impound our vehicles and then all of a sudden they let us pass 
said convoy coordinator raul valdez 40 of austin 
valdez said he drove pathfinder the lead convoy vehicle 
directly past us customs officials and paid his 75cent bridge 
toll at 1030 pm tuesday the truck was involved with all three 
incidents at which us customs has blocked the groups exit 
customs spokeswoman donna de la torre said thursday that the 
convoy had crossed into mexico without the knowledge or approval of 
the us government and that the group still faces possible 
prosecution if it does not return the vehicles within 30 days 
violating the nicaraguan trade control regulations could mean 
fines of up to 50000 and up to 10 years in prison 
some of the vehicles bear signs and brightly painted slogans 
including a multicolored school bus emblazoned with veterans 
peace convoy to nicaragua and bikes not bombs 
ms de la torre said the governments policy toward the convoy 
had not changed 
last month a convoy attempt to cross with 38 vehicles and 106 
people was blocked by customs officials who stood in the roadway 
and temporarily detained four of the groups trucks the activists 
then drove to washington dc tried unsuccessfully to meet with 
federal officials and returned to laredo last friday 
the convoy is sending some 300 tons of supplies by ship about 
10 tons of supplies were loaded on the vehicles when the group 
arrived in laredo last week for its second attempt at crossing the 
border

mohammed ali hamadi charged with 
air piracy and murder in the 1985 twa hijacking to beirut said a 
lebanese group called the organization of martyrs paid for his 
visit to islamic holy places in iran 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem told the court thursday that 
he visited islamic holy sites at qom and mashhad traveling via 
tehran asked by the judge to give a date for his trip hamadi 
first said he could not remember but later said it could have been 
in 1985 
hamadi has said he spent two years as a fighter with the amal 
militia in beirut but has repeatedly denied being a member of 
hezbollah a radical iranbacked shiite moslem group in lebanon 
the group is believed to be an umbrella organization for 
kidnappers holding foreign hostages in lebanon one of hamadis 
brothers abdulhadi is hezbollahs security chief 
the twa jetliner was hijacked in june 1985 on a flight from 
athens to rome 
us navy diver robert stethem of waldorf maryland was shot 
and killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in beirut 
thirtynine americans were held hostage during the 17day ordeal 
a court document introduced thursday also indicated that hamadi 
was being sought on a murder charge in beirut in 1983 
the document read by chief judge heiner mueckenberger gave no 
details hamadi said he was not aware of the charges 
the document was obtained after west german federal 
investigators asked authorities in lebanon for assistance in their 
investigation of hamadi 
hamadis defense attorneys questioned the value of the document 
as evidence saying it was an unsigned telex with few details 
hamadi also said that he smuggled explosives into west germany 
because he was afraid of committing a sin against islam 
i did not say no because im a moslem and its my duty to obey 
those who are wiser hamadi said referring to a man he said 
ordered him to smuggle liquid explosives into west germany 
the koran says obey allah obey the prophet and obey those who 
give you orders i was afraid of committing a sin if i did not 
accept 
he refused to identify the man who ordered him to smuggle the 
explosives 
on wednesday hamadi admitted bringing explosives into west 
germany on two occasions he was arrested at frankfurt airport in 
january 1987 when liquid explosives were found in his luggage but 
he said he had succeeded in smuggling another shipment a few weeks 
earlier 
in other testimony hamadi said he fought in southern lebanon 
against israeli forces and took part in street battles in beirut 
against government soldiers and christian phalangist militiamen 
in lebanon between 1984 and 1987 
he said he had been wounded in the arm by a bullet in streeting 
fighting in 1985 but could not remember if his arm was still in a 
cast in june when the hijacking took place 
hamadi has testified that he was a member of the shiite moslem 
amal militia from 1980 to 1982 he said he also took part in 
fighting during that period 
he arrived in west germany late in 1982 and applied for 
political asylum but returned to lebanon in november 1984 after 
his request was turned down 
west germany last year rejected a us request for hamadis 
extradition 
a duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers abbas ali 
hamadi to 13 years in prison in april for the january 1987 
kidnappings of two west germans in beirut in an attempt to gain 
mohammeds freedom 
the trial is scheduled to continue on tuesday

the land of pure pasta and taut tortellini is afraid 
that italians wont be using the old noodle anymore 
italy the mecca of macaroni since the days of marco polo is 
bracing for what purists say will be an invasion of rubbery 
ravioli squishy spaghetti and heaven forbid limp linguine 
in the coming weeks italians will have to say goodbye to 
their beloved firm pasta said the newspaper la repubblica 
on thursday italy lost its bid to maintain its socalled 
pasta purity law a 1967 rule requiring all pasta sold in the 
country to contain durum wheat which is firmer and more expensive 
than other varieties of wheat 
the european economic communitys court of justice ruled that 
italy could not use the law to block pasta imports from the other 
11 common market nations even though italy still can compel its 
own pasta makers to use durum wheat 
that flavorful and firm macaroni the product of our able 
pasta makers will be challenged and maybe even replaced by the 
gluey and insipid pasta from germany or holland la repubblica 
moaned 
italians have been eating pasta for at least 700 years and claim 
it was brought to italy by marco polo it is always cooked al 
dente or firm 
we have a profound respect for pasta said giuseppe menconi 
director of the italian union of pasta makers 
go to germany and eat their pasta he said in a telephone 
interview it practically melts on the plate our pasta is alive 
on the plate 
italian pasta makers insist the issue was not one of trade 
barriers 
this is a question of protecting the consumer said albino 
ganaspini the spokesman for barilla the worlds largest pasta 
producer with an output of 450000 tons a year 
italian firms produce about 18 million tons of pasta a year 
and the average italian gulps down about 55 pounds of noodles 
annually 
ganaspini said imported pasta could cost up to 30 percent less 
than the kind made with durum wheat but predicted few italian 
customers would lower their standards 
the pasta case was brought to the common markets court by west 
german pasta producer drei glocken after an italian court sought to 
block the companys export of pasta made with a wheat blend 
the courts decision was based partly on a similar case in march 
1987 when it ruled that west germanys beer purity law violated 
eec free trade rules 
the german rule had banned beers that did not contain the four 
pure ingredients hops yeast malt and water 
despite the presence of the cheaper foreign beers west germans 
have remained loyal to their pure domestic brews will italians 
stick to their pure pasta or go for the new wave of noodle 
sure id buy it because its cheaper said orsolina 
petrini a roman seamstress 
but claudio cecarelli owner of a pasta shop in central rome 
founded by his grandmother said italians will not mind paying more 
for the purer pasta 
when we eat pasta it is with a certain amount of 
religiosity he said

like mona lisa the mystery woman has 
dark hair soft brown eyes with a comehither look and full red 
lips with a faintly amused expression but after 1700 years she 
is getting a facelift 
the greatness of this woman is that she speaks to you from 
beyond time said ehud netzer of hebrew university codirector 
of a project to move and preserve the womans portrait in a 4th 
century mosaic on the floor of a roman villa 
on thursday archaeologists began the arduous task of lifting 
the 430squarefoot mosaic rolling it up strip by strip and moving 
it 125 miles south to the israel museum in jerusalem 
the womans beauty and ambiguous expression have prompted a 
comparison a famous leonardo da vinci painting the mona lisa 
which hangs in the louvre museum in paris 
its the eyes they follow you there is nothing like her in 
contemporary roman art said eric m meyers an archaeologist 
from duke university in durham nc who is directing the project 
with his wife carol 
the scholars still dont know whether the woman was a real 
person or an artists concept of ideal beauty they say she could 
be a famous actress from the nearby theater a woman the artist 
loved or a depiction of aphrodite the ancient goddess of love 
maybe she was supposed to be aphrodite but maybe she was a 
real live person as well said meyers 
one clue to the womans identity may be in the building itself 
which meyers speculates might have been an inn housing visiting 
actors for the 3000seat theater next door 
brackets on the floor indicate three couches were placed around 
the mosaic and that the room was used for dining maybe even as an 
aftertheater restaurant 
the border of the mosaic contains theater masks and the theme of 
the panels is connected to the god dionysis who was associated 
with the theater so the mystery woman might have been an actress 
an elizabeth taylor of her day 
the betting is 2to1 that she was a real person said laura 
zucker 20 one of about 100 american students and volunteers 
helping on the dig 
the portrait and other panels of the mosaic are done in tiny 
naturally colored stones that meyers said were laid down over a 
watercolor blueprint painted by the artist 
the state of preservation as well as the subtle artistry are 
remarkable for example there was still a blush of color on the 
cheeks when the portrait was daubed with a wet sponge 
the task of giving the mosaic a facelift has fallen to dodo 
shenhav an israel museum expert who compares raising the 
18by24foot mosaic to surgery 
shenhav whose past challenges have included removing the dead 
sea scrolls from sealed ceramic jars said the operation will 
involve fixing a water soluble glue to the mosaic and covering it 
with burlap and additional glue 
once the seal is fixed workers chisel under the stone carpet 
and roll it up in a halfdozen strips 
the pace is expected to be slow and shenhav said it could take 
two to three weeks 
sepphoris site of the modernday cooperative farm of zippori 
was the capital of the galilee province of roman palestine 
it was a cosmopolitan city one of the few places where jews 
pagans and christians lived in harmony the mosaic is contemporary 
with rabbi yehuda hanassi who codified the jewish law of the 
mishna in the city about ad 220 
the city only four miles from nazareth is also sacred to 
christians as the birthplace of the virgin mary 
the city which had a population of 20000 in roman times was 
devastated by an earthquake in 363 the tremors brought down the 
villa in which the mosaic was located and the rubble helped 
preserve the mosaic

eight years after jimmy carter left the white 
house in defeat and despair his long political exile is coming to 
an end here in his native georgia 
no longer is he shunned by the democratic establishment or 
scorned as the hapless leader who turned over the keys of the white 
house to republican ronald reagan 
with the democratic convention threatened by discord jesse 
jackson turned to carter to mediate his highprofile differences 
with michael dukakis he has earned respect of all of us 
jackson explained 
jackson said he wants carter to play a real role in settling 
the differences he understands the equation jackson said 
carter will deliver an openingnight speech before the 
democratic convention on monday he is hosting receptions for the 
media former cabinet members and other dignitaries 
and the carter presidential center will be the site for many 
conventionrelated activities such as forums on domestic and 
foreign policy issues 
at long last carter is an undisputed elder statesman of the 
party 
democratic chairman paul kirk said americans have changed their 
opinion about carter after eight years of threebyfive cards and 
handsoff government under reagan 
people understand the sincerity and the seriousness of purpose 
and the enlightment of values and views that president carter 
brought to his administration kirk said 
and i think he will be greeted and welcomed at the democratic 
convention as he should be just as a president whose roots were 
planted and nurtured here in georgia but who made a great 
contribution to values around the globe kirk said 
those must be sweet words to carter particularly since they 
come from a man who wanted to see sen edward kennedy dmass not 
carter as the democratic nominee for president in 1980 
it hasnt been easy for carter since reagan turned him out of 
office in 1980 humiliating him with a 44state sweep even after 
losing the white house carter remained a favorite target of reagan 
and republicans blamed for the sagging economy and ridiculed by 
george bush for talking about americas malaise 
for a long while carter was remembered as the president who 
left american hostages in iran the leader who authorized a rescue 
attempt that ended in failure in the desert he presided over a 
nation that waited in long lines for gasoline and had to pay 
doubledigit interest rates for loans 
but reagan has had his setbacks too 242 servicemen killed in 
lebanon americans held hostage in lebanon record budget deficits 
the irancontra scandal and most recently the picture of an 
american warship shooting down a civilian airliner over the persian 
gulf killing 290 people 
perhaps these events have softened the republicanpromoted image 
of carter as inept 
on the campaign trail bush certain to be the republican 
presidential nominee is likely to pass over carter and talk about 
mcgovern democrats 
a relationship with carter has proven not to be a political 
liability as evidenced by the election successes of former 
administration members such as carters secretary of 
transportation brock adams who won a senate seat from washington 
state and andrew young former un ambassador who now is mayor of 
atlanta 
though carters name is not frequently invoked by michael 
dukakis all of the democrats who ran for president dukakis 
included made a pilgrimage to georgia to pay respects this year 
carters success is in marked contrast to that of another former 
president richard nixon fourteen years after nixon resigned in 
disgrace he still avoids the republican presidential conventions 
and plays only a backstage role in offering occasional advice to 
reagan and bush

ran for president during the democratic primary and caucus season 
this has been not only accomplished in record time but it has 
been accomplished without asking any business person who provided 
services to the campaign to take any discount gore told a news 
conference on thursday 
gore said a 10week fundraising effort among supporters across 
the nation plus federal matching funds will make it possible for 
him to retire his campaign debts

of the money raised while political action committees for special 
interests provided another 5 percent gore said in his announcement

the leftist sandinista governments 
violent crackdown on its critics has backfired and given new 
momentum to opponents dissidents say 
these actions are going to strengthen the attitude of the 
common people who dont want this regime said virgilio godoy a 
former sandinista labor minister and the president of the 
independent liberal party this is the start of the opposition 
moving from words to actions 
meanwhile president daniel ortega said that any us decision 
to resume arms shipments to the contra rebels would revive a war in 
which a truce was declared months ago 
we hope they the united states do not commit this madness 
since it would be newly legitimizing the civil war ortega said 
thursday on staterun voice of nicaragua radio 
during the crackdown this week the government broke up a 
demonstration closed independent news outlets and expelled the 
us ambassador the fallout continued thursday when the us 
house voted 38518 to condemn ortegas government for brutal 
suppression of basic human rights 
a similar resolution was passed wednesday by the senate that 
measure included the possibility of military aid to the contras if 
present sandinista policy does not become more democratic 
its tremendously interventionist and illegal deputy 
foreign minister hugh tinoco said of the senate resolution we 
call this imperialism 
tinoco defended the crackdown as a response to growing threats 
from the contras and from attempts to destabilize the government 
we cant take this with our arms folded he said in an 
interview with the associated press what country in the world 
wouldnt take measures 
on sunday government troops used tear gas and truncheons to 
crush a demonstration by 100000 people in nandaime south of 
managua 
the government said 31 demontrators were sentenced to sixmonth 
jail terms on thursday for violating public security laws five 
others received the same sentences on wednesday 
on monday the sandinistas expelled us ambassador richard 
melton and seven diplomats charging them with crimes against the 
nicaraguan people and saying they authored a destabilization plan 
that included the sunday march 
at the same time the government closed the roman catholic radio 
station and suspended for 15 days the only opposition newspaper la 
prensa 
the free press was used as part of the destabilization plan 
tinoco said 
la prensa repeatedly attacked the government the newspaper had 
backed the sandinistas when they came to power in a 1979 
revolutionary war that deposed the dictatorship of anastasio somoza 
the sandinistas and the contras negotiated a truce in march and 
agreed to discuss a permanent end to their 7yearold civil war 
but a series of highlevel talks collapsed without agreement on 
june 9 
in recent weeks there has been a sharp increase in the number of 
contra attacks reported by the defense ministry at least eight 
civilians and several dozen soldiers have been killed in ambushes 
a source in santo domingo in the dominican republic said 
thursday that contra leaders planned to meet there this weekend to 
reorganize the rebel organization and select new leadership the 
source spoke on condition of anonymity 
the rebel group has been plagued by internal disputes between 
moderates and hardliners and a lack of cash since us aid was cut 
off earlier this year 
opposition political groups inside the country however said 
the government crackdown has fueled the antisandinista movement 
enrique bolanos head of the superior private enterprise 
council said the sandinistas reacted harshly because they cannot 
stand the tremendous opposition that is gaining momentum 
the often fragmented political opposition showed more unity on 
sunday than ever before in striking out against the battered 
economy

americans have failed to use several effective 
cancer screening techniques often enough possibly because of a 
lack of publicity and the reluctance of some doctors to recommend 
them researchers say 
however two wellknown tests pap smears and breast exams are 
widely used the national centers for disease control reported 
thursday in its preliminary findings in a 1987 national health 
interview survey on cancer control 
the survey asked people about the six major tests recommended 
for early detection of cancer in their age and sex groups results 
point to work that needs to be done in spreading the word about 
some recommended tests the atlantabased agency said 
efforts to increase the routine use of these screening tests 
must include educating the public the cdc said this practice 
permits the early detection of disease when treatment is most 
effective that is before symptoms occur 
for instance while 97 percent of those surveyed had heard of 
pap smears only 68 percent of survey respondents had heard of 
proctoscopy the cdc report said citing results from 5723 
interviews over the surveys first three months 
the six tests are annual pap smears for women 18 and up and 
earlier if sexually active to check for cervical cancer regular 
breast exams and mammograms for women 40 and over for breast 
cancer and the three checks for colon or rectum cancer periodic 
digital rectal exams for people 40 and over yearly bloodstool 
exams for those 50 and over and proctoscopic exams every three to 
five years for those 50 and over 
only 3 percent of the women 18 and over had never heard of pap 
smears and 8 percent of the women 40 and over had never heard of 
breast exams 
but findings were much lower for the other tests seventeen 
percent of those who should have such tests had never heard of 
mammography 20 percent had never heard of digital rectal exams 17 
percent had never heard of bloodstool exams and 32 percent had 
never heard of proctoscopic exams 
furthermore for every test except pap smears and breast exams 
between 19 percent and 45 percent of those surveyed who had heard 
of the test had never had one in contrast 94 percent of women who 
had heard of pap smears have had one and 92 percent of women who 
know about breast examination have had it 
with the exception of the pap smear and physical breast 
examination cancer screening procedures are underutilized in the 
united states the cdc concluded 
it might simply be a lack of publicity said dr grey 
thompson a fellow in cancer prevention and control at the national 
cancer institute in the washington suburbs some research 
indicates that some physicians arent recommending them 
that she said could be due in part to early concerns about the 
radiation involved in mammograms newermodel machines emit much 
less radiation so now that fear can be pretty much put away 
she said 
also she noted that pap smears and physical breast exam 
techniques have been in use longer than some of the other tests 
the survey results also found discrepancies between blacks and 
whites in knowledge of the tests for instance while 15 percent of 
white women over 40 had never heard of mammography 30 percent of 
black women over 40 never had while 29 percent of white 
respondents over 40 had never heard of proctoscopy the figure for 
blacks was 55 percent 
researchers definitely believe the racial differences are 
tied to education levels and socioeconomic status ms thompson 
said 
the findings were for januarymarch 1987 at the end of this 
year researchers hope to release the results from the complete 
12month survey

the government banned a 
birthday concert for nelson mandela because it is terrified of any 
event that honors the jailed black leader antiapartheid activists 
said 
activists had hoped to the pop music show would be the highlight 
of celebrations marking mandelas 70th birthday 
but aubrey mokoena an activist who coordinated arrangements for 
the concert for peace said the justice ministry told 
organizers thursday that the show would be scrapped 
the daylong concert was to feature some of south africas top 
black musicians and take place near the black township of soweto 
it was scheduled for sunday the day before mandelas birthday 
mandela is probably the most popular leader among south africas 
disenfranchised black majority mokoena said the government 
declined to give reasons for the ban 
the only possible conclusion is that the south african 
government is terrified of the concept of the mandela 
celebration mokoena said 
the organizers had anticipated a crowd of 25000 people at the 
concert and planned to donate the proceeds to charities they had 
arranged to hire a private security firm to ensure that no 
disturbances occurred 
police last week arrested several people organizing a separate 
mandela birthday celebration in cape town activists fear that 
event will also be banned but the government has made no 
announcement 
activists said at a news conference after the arrests that they 
were determined to find a way to honor mandela 
in spite of all the intimidation in spite of the obvious fear 
of the government our decision is clear we will celebrate said 
the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of reformed 
churches 
if we cannot come together in our streets and halls he 
said we will celebrate in our homes and churches but we will 
make sure mandelas birthday does not go by unnoticed 
police refused comment on a south african council of churches 
report that officers raided offices of cape town antiapartheid 
organizations wednesday confiscating posters advertising mandelas 
birthday 
the police were looking for documents and posters they could 
submit to a magistrate as part of their argument for having the 
mandela birthday celebrations banned the church council said 
we fail to conceptualize how the celebration of mr mandelas 
birthday with song and dance can constitute a threat 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and received a life sentence 
in 1964 after being convicted of plotting a sabotage campaign to 
overthrow whiteminority rule when arrested he was leader of the 
guerrilla wing of the outlawed african national congress 
surveys indicate mandela probably would be elected president if 
blacks could vote in national elections 
his release from cape towns pollsmoor prison has been sought in 
a prolonged international campaign 
but the government has said it will not free him until he 
publicly renounces violence he has rejected the condition unless 
the government lifts its ban on the guerrilla group and dismantles 
apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

robert x williams jr the only 
obstetriciangynecologist in two poor counties with high infant 
mortality rates just worked himself to death one of his 
nurses said after he died while performing surgery 
his son robert x williams iii a thirdyear medical student 
watched helplessly as williams suffered a massive heart attack 
wednesday at bullock county hospital 
he never turned patients down no matter what their financial 
status williams said recalling times when his father received 
5 a month from a patient trying to pay off a medical bill 
the elder williams 54 had been delivering 60 to 80 babies a 
month in bullock and macon counties which have some of the 
nations highest infant mortality rates according to the state 
department of public health 
i think there were times when for a period of several weeks 
he was on call constantly said hospital administrator duane 
brookhart adding that he was amazed at williams heavy workload 
i asked him how he was able to keep such a schedule he would 
shrug and say you get used to it 
because of williams death obstetrics patients will have to be 
referred to montgomery hospitals 40 miles away brookhart said 
finding a replacement to serve the two counties will be difficult 
its a very medically needy and also a medically risky and 
underinsured population he said adding that most obstetricians 
prefer to share their practices and workloads with a partner 
were a small rural community i dont think we can support 
two obstetricians and i dont think were going to find another 
obstetrician who is willing to work this whole area by himself 
dr henry johnson a montgomery obstetrician who studied under 
williams said he influenced many young black doctors 
he took care of essentially anyone who came to see him 
johnson said i cant remember too many times when he left the 
area for a vacation or whatever he was pretty much on call 24 
hours a day 
williams had nearly completed a hysterectomy when he died st 
margarets hospital in montgomery used its emergency helicopter to 
fly dr judi jehle to union springs to complete the surgery which 
was done without complications hospital spokeswoman cathy ellis 
said thursday 
the patient was given a spinal anesthesia and she was awake 
during the entire thing ms jehle said when i got there 
she seemed pretty calm but she watched the whole thing 
williams had delivered several babies tuesday and i could 
tell from his oncall room he had been at the hospital all night 
ms jehle said when i left one of the nurses shook her head and 
said he worked himself to death 
williams had planned to leave on a cruise this weekend to 
celebrate his 32nd anniversary ms jehle said 
his son stood by in the operating room as medical personnel 
tried to save his fathers life 
that was one of the worst feelings i have ever had in my 
life the younger williams said thursday i felt helpless 
he was a good person at heart and he was the best teacher and 
mentor i had in my life williams said 
he said he hopes to return to macon or bullock counties as a 
doctor after he completes his medical training 
theres no one to take his place down here he said

sugar is making a comeback among american 
consumers after years of trailing other sweeteners and might be 
about ready to hold its own says an agriculture department analyst 
robert barry of the departments economic research service said 
that in 1987 americans used more sugar instead of less for the 
first time in 12 years per capita consumption rose 3 pecent to an 
average of 622 pounds for the year 
the deliveries of refined sugar to the food and beverage 
industries and wholesale and retail markets rose 5 percent from 
1986 to more than 76 million tons 
despite the increase sugar still made up only about 40 percent 
of the 1524 pounds average 1987 per capita consumption of all 
sweeteners including those with calories and those without 
barry said in the july issue of farmline magazine that growth in 
the us population and higher incomes have contributed to greater 
sugar use but there are other reasons and one of the most 
important involves hfcs or high fructose corn syrup 
after more than a decade of seizing markets from sugar in such 
diverse products as beverages baked goods jams and other 
processed foods the cheaper to produce hfcs has come close to 
reaching its technical limit of substitutability he said this 
has stanched the dramatic losses of sugar in the past 12 years 
barry added of course there is the possibility of a 
technical breakthrough such as lowercost forms of dry fructose 
or lowcalorie sweeteners 
the sugar industry had been threatened by rival sweeteners for 
many years but suffered no major losses until about 1975 when hfcs 
emerged sugar prices were high at the time and hfcs was cheaper 
to produce an advantage it still holds 
at the time in 1975 the beverage industry was sugars largest 
single market using 25 percent of the sugar available by last 
year beverages used only 3 percent turning to hfcs and noncaloric 
sweeteners for diet drinks sugar deliveries to the beverage 
industry dropped to 212000 tons in 1987 from 2 million in 1975 
but in other industrial uses sugar and hfcs are not always 
interchangeable barry said for example sugar deliveries to 
bakery and cereal manufacturers rose to 15 million tons last year 
from 12 million in 1975 
candy makers increased sugar use last year by 91 percent from 
1986 one reason is that hfcs a liquid is less adaptable in candy 
manufacture 
a big question for the future of hfcs involves federal sugar 
policy barry said that much will depend on whether sugar will 
continue to be supported by the government at current price levels 
which encourage the development of substitute sweeteners 
the us sugar policy also involves imports and measures used to 
protect domestic producers from cheaper foreign sugar flooding the 
market although there was some strengthening in may the world 
price of sugar was still only 9 cents per pound or only half of 
the us support price 
bills are in congress which would lower the support levels 
thereby reducing domestic output and boosting imports that is the 
approach favored by the reagan administration 
another initiative by the administration seeks to liberalize 
trade through multilateral trade negotiations of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade gatt he said the goal is to 
eliminate tradedistorting subsidies and allow better market access 
for sugar worldwide 
barry said a freer world market could reduce sugar prices for 
american consumers but would probably also reduce the size of the 
us sugar industry

richard j hemmelsbach is finding 
that being adopted by a childless baron is a costly honor 
the ferrysburg businessman was one of 10000 people who 
responded to a search by a german baron looking for an heir the 
search was first publicized june 3 on the nationally syndicated 
television show a current affair 
hemmelsbach 57 met baron theordor von liebieg last week at the 
barons 100bedroom castle on the mosel and rhine rivers in west 
germany and was chosen heir he will inherit the castle when the 
76yearold baron dies 
but theres a catch 
one of the stipulations was that hemmelsbach help the baron pay 
off a 600000 mortgage on the castle 
i already have been adopted but now i have to go out and slay 
the dragon hemmelsbach said 
he said his adoptive father said he sold the castle several 
years ago to a developer who began turning it into a hotel and 
restaurant but ran into financial trouble now a bank wants to 
repossess the castle hemmelsbach said 
hemmelsbach said the baron also wants his heir to help him raise 
1 million to turn the hotel into an international hotel 
he just does not have the vim and vigor to go out and do these 
things so he said this is something my new heir can do my new 
son hemmelsbach said 
one of the reasons he chose me is because i have an 
entrepreneurial background 
hemmelsbach owns two small businesses in the ferrysburg area 
including a sales company that represents acrylics manufacturers 
he also owns a company that developed an electronic warning device 
for the elderly he said 
while the television show reported the 1428yearold castle was 
on 89000 acres blueprints show only 100 acres hemmelsbach said

opposition candidates began a nationwide 
round of rallies to press their charges that the governing party 
stole the presidential election 
the victor carlos salinas de gortari said the governing 
institutional revolutionary party must respond to calls for change 
after its biggest losses ever in the july 6 balloting 
an estimated 15000 supporters of conservative national action 
party candidate manuel j clouthier withstood a downpour thursday 
in the western city of guadalajara to hear him accuse the 
government of manipulating the election 
he said his appearance in mexicos second largest city was the 
first in a national tour to gather signatures in a referendum to 
decide whether the party should seek to have the election annulled 
clouthier who won in guadalajara but finished third nationwide 
in results announced wednesday by the federal election commission 
said he does not know who won but he said neither salinas nor 
cuauhtemoc cardenas candidate of the left can claim a credible 
victory 
the commission dominated by the institutional revolutionary 
party or pri said salinas won with 5036 percent of the vote 
cardenas followed with 3112 percent and clouthier with 1707 
percent 
cardenas candidate of the leftist national democratic front and 
the mexican socialist party planned to begin a national tour next 
week after a major rally in the huge zocalo plaza on saturday 
he said he would target regions where he considers fraud was 
the most brutal and ran roughshod on our party members the son 
of one of mexicos most popular presidents cardenas led a 
dissident movement in the pri before breaking away to become 
candidate of several small parties 
commission figures showed he won in the federal district the 
adjacent states of mexico and morelos the central western state of 
michoacan and baja california the northern half of the peninsula 
the loss was the biggest ever since the pri was founded in 1929 
but it still retained control of both houses of congress 
parties supporting cardenas won four of the 64 senate seats in 
an unprecedented loss for the pri both the left and the right made 
inroads in the chamber of deputies the lower house of congress 
the absence of any official presidential returns for a week 
after the balloting fed reports of fraud and rumors of feuding 
between oldguard pri leaders who wanted their traditional 
overwhelming victories and supporters of salinas who said he 
wanted a clean election 
salinas receiving congratulatory visits from partyaffiliated 
organizations thursday said he had been given a clear mandate 
for change and called for unity among all parties and factions 
the pri today has the capacity and flexibility to face 
successfully the call for change he told state governors and the 
partys executive committee may no one try to convert political 
plurality into national division 
lorenzo meyer academic coordinator at the prestigious colegio 
de mexico said that since mexican independence elections have 
been used to transfer power within a group or party rather than to 
decide which would govern or who the leaders would be 
it is because of this tremendous weight of antidemocratic 
history that what is happening today is important and it is for 
that same reason that the change in electoral custom from 
noncompetitive elections to true elections finds so many 
obstacles he wrote in the newspaper excelsior this week 
change he said is only beginning 
its obvious that the birth of modern mexico is turning out to 
be a difficult and prolonged delivery and that its still not known 
if it will reach a happy ending he said 
some of the pris losing candidates said the party must reform 
to survive 
with the triumphs obtained by the opposition a profound 
restructuring of the party to recover the ground lost in the 
past elections becomes indispensable cuauhtemoc sanchez barrales 
told the newspaper el sol de toluca 40 miles west of mexico city 
in the state of mexico 
he lost a congressional election in the tolucametepec district 
to a candidate from cardenas coalition 
julio millan an economic consultant who lost a congressional 
race to national action in the capital said the party now has to 
demand from officials greater efficiency and dedication a pure 
honesty and an attitude of service that the population is 
demanding

a reagan administration official says the 
government is going to take another look at whether it should 
finance research into test tube fertilization to produce babies 
dr robert e windom the health and human services departments 
assistant secretary for health acknowledged under questioning 
before a house subcommittee thursday that a new ethics advisory 
board is being formed but said the new panel might not be completed 
in time for action before the reagan administration leaves office 
in january 
windom told the human resources subcommittee of the house 
committee on government operations that the decision to form a 
panel to restudy the question on whether to lift a de facto ban on 
federally financed research is in response to a recommendation from 
dr james b wyngaarden director of the national institutes of 
health wyngaarden has recommended the government approve a grant 
from washington university in st louis to conduct in vitro

presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari 
says he has a mandate to modernize the nations political and 
economic systems because he is the youngest elected chief executive 
in more than 50 years 
salinas de gortari 40 was declared the winner in the july 6 
election as the candidate of the institutional revolutionary party 
or pri which has governed mexico since 1929 he takes office in 
december 
the youngest chief executive this century was lazaro cardenas 
one of mexicos most revered presidents who was 39 when he took 
office in 1934 today half of mexicos population is 16 or younger 
cardenas son cuauhtemoc cardenas was one of two opposition 
candidates who gave salinas a tough race that resulted in the 
slimmest victory margin for the pri in its history also running 
was manuel j clouthier of the conservative national action party 
critics of the pri contended the party won the election through 
fraud 
salinas insists that he does not mind the lower margin of 
victory that it represents a first step in modernization as a 
recognition of opposition forces and recent changes in mexico 
in claiming victory the day after the polls closed salinas said 
the end of the era of virtually exclusive power for the pri must be 
recognized 
it is the new political reality of the nation and with which 
we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful fashion 
he said 
salinas spoke during the campaign of the need for democratic 
reforms clean elections and less state intervention in the 
economy 
he will have to prove to mexicans weary of six years of economic 
hardship that growth can start again jobs can be generated and the 
steady erosion of purchasing power halted 
salinas main problem after his inauguration will be to foster 
faith in his government so it can support any reforms he plans to 
undertake 
an increasingly greater number of mexicans have become 
disenchanted with and skeptical of the pri and the countrys 
political institutions as indicated by the high number of 
abstenteeism at election time about half the registered voters 
according to government figures 
like his three precedessors salinas has had no experience in 
elective office he joined the pri when he was 18 and rose through 
the ranks of the government bureaucracy by dint of party loyalty to 
become outgoing president miguel de la madrids budget and planning 
secretary 
but unlike the other three he comes from a family of seasoned 
pri politicians his father raul salinas lozano was commerce and 
industry secretary in the 195864 administration of president 
adolfo lopez mateos and is currently a pri senator for the familys 
home state of nuevo leon bordering the united states 
an uncle elias de gortari is a university professor and pri 
ideologue his mother margarita de gortari carvajal an economist 
active in party politics helped found and was the first president 
of the association of women economists 
the salinas are an old spanish family that first settled in the 
small nuevo leon town of agualeguas in the 18th century 
the new president was born in mexico city on april 3 1948 he 
and his wife cecilia occelli gonzalez have three children 
an economist salinas is among the best educated of mexicos 
presidents he holds two masters degrees and a doctorate in public 
administration all from harvard 
he speaks and reads english and french in addition to his native 
spanish 
salinas also is an avid sportsman as a member of mexicos 
equestrian team he won a silver medal in riding at the 1971 
panamerican games 
he often runs several miles a day plays tennis and is a soccer 
fan 
short slim and balding with a full mustache salinas is always 
smartly dressed and groomed his closest associates say that behind 
his genial demeanor is a sharp mind and forceful character 
political writer adrian lajous described him in a biographical 
sketch as exceptionally intelligent and also very fast mentally

president reagan has given conflicting 
indications on whether he will veto a pentagon budget bill that 
deeply cuts his request for star wars spending and restricts his 
arms control policies lawmakers say 
i dont think we have a clear signal senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan said im not certain the president will sign 
this bill 
dole spoke on thursday shortly before the senate voted 6430 for 
the measure hours after the house approved it 229183 both 
democraticcontrolled chambers split along party lines as they sent 
the bill to reagans desk 
dole and sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed 
services committee told their colleagues that defense secretary 
frank c carlucci had indicated reagan was likely to sign the bill 
but sen daniel quayle rind who made an unsuccessful attempt 
to strip the provisions reagan disliked said the administration 
opposed the measure 
the bill permits 4 billion for the strategic defense 
initiative as reagans 5yearold star wars antimissile program 
is formally known that is slightly above the current sdi budget of 
39 billion but far less than the 48 billion reagan wanted 
as part of the star wars budget the bill deeply reduced 
spending for the spacebased interceptor which is being developed 
as the first phase of an eventual sdi program the pentagon wanted 
330 million for the program but the bill restricts the total to 
only 85 million 
the final measure was worked out by a housesenate conference 
committee and is a compromise between bills passed separately by 
each chamber 
shortly before the final vote the senate rejected 5835 an 
effort by quayle and other conservative republicans to return the 
bill to a conference committee and strip out the star wars 
reductions and other arms control restrictions opposed by reagan 
the bill authorizes pentagon spending of 2995 billion for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 the total is a slight reduction from 
the 301 billion authorized this year and marks the fourth straight 
year of either freezes or reductions in the defense budget 
following large increases during reagans first term 
highlights of the bill 
arms control the measure requires withdrawal and retirement of 
three aging missilefiring poseidon submarines as new 
missilefiring boats are introduced into the fleet that continues 
the policy of generally keeping the united states near weapons 
limits imposed by the unratified salt ii nuclear treaty 
the bill also directs the energy department to prepare for a 
comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests a longtime goal of arms 
control supporters 
the measure bans flight testing of depressed trajectory 
missiles as long as the soviets refrain from testing their 
versions of those weapons depressed trajectory weapons which fly 
relatively low could be launched from submarines and could 
theoretically be launched off each nations shores with relatively 
little warning time 
militarydrugs the bill includes 300 million to increase the 
militarys role in the antidrug effort and orders the pentagon to 
provide more intelligence and tracking information to civilian law 
enforcement agencies 
pay raises the nations 21 million uniformed military 
personnel will receive a 41 percent pay increase reagan had 
sought a 43 percent increase 
nuclear weapons the measure proposes 250 million each for the 
singlewarhead midgetman and the railroad version of the mx a pair 
of landbased nuclear missiles reagan wanted only 200 million for 
the midgetman which is strongly backed by democrats and 793 
million for the mx the bill also contains 250 million that the 
secretary of defense in the new administration next year can spend 
for either program 
navy ships the bill includes money for one more trident 
missilefiring submarine a pair of los angelesclass attack subs 
the first of a new seawolf class of attack subs three destroyers 
two oilers and an amphibious assault ship 
other weapons the measure provides money for 180 f16 jet

proper aircraft inspection is the weak link 
in efforts to prevent accidents like the one that ripped the top 
off an aloha airlines jetliner at 24000 feet a federal aviation 
administration expert says 
a national transportation safety board panel which winds up 
four days of testimony here today is trying to determine the cause 
of the april 28 accident and what it can teach about the problems 
of operating aging airplanes 
tom swift an faa national resource specialist on aircraft 
structures from long beach calif also told the hearing thursday 
that he believes the boeing 737 broke open because a bonded 
fuselage joint separated leading to a rapid failure of the metal 
along a line of rivets 
it was the worstcase condition swift said 
another faa witness told the inquiry board that tiny cracks were 
found in nearly half the boeing 737 jetliners known to have been 
inspected under an faa airworthiness directive issued after the 
aloha accident 
an 18foot section blew away from the top of the pressurized 
aloha jet over hawaii throwing a flight attendant to her death and 
injuring 61 of the 94 people aboard passengers in the forward 
cabin were exposed to the air while the pilot made an emergency 
landing 
asked by inquiry chairman john k lauber what the bottom 
line was for preventing another such accident swift replied it 
rested with the airlines and their inspection programs for 
corrosion and metal fatigue 
i know where the weak link is and its in the inspection 
swift said 
such inspections are mindnumbing jobs he said adding that 
research was needed to take the human element out of the 
inspections 
hell we put a man on the moon why cant we develop an 
inspection program that can guarantee we can find these cracks 
he asked 
the aloha jet built in 1969 had had 89680 landings 
secondhighest of any 737 
swift one of the faa officials who examined the jet said he 
believes adhesive gave way along a lap joint where parts of the 
fuselage are bonded and riveted together most likely because of 
corrosion 
within a week of the aloha accident the faa ordered all 737s 
with 30000 or more landings to undergo a special visual inspection 
of fuselage lap joints and 737s with more than 50000 landings to 
have additional inspections using highfrequency electronic 
equipment 
airlines were required to fix any problems found and report test 
results to the faa 
james w hart jr manager of the airframe branch in the faas 
seattle aircraft certification office told the ntsb panel 291 
planes were affected by the order as of this week he said the 
faa has received reports on 100 planes of which 49 had cracks 
five or more cracks were found in 14 of those planes he said 
bill ashworth manager of the faas seattle aircraft 
certification division said he was concerned about the cracks but 
saw no imminent danger to the planes or to air passengers 
we of course are requiring that all cracks we find be 
repaired thats only prudent maintenance he said

drug traffickers in many latin 
american countries are donating money and offering drugs to parish 
priests and the roman catholic church is not sure what to do about 
it a venezuelan bishop said 
monsignor baltazar porras assistant bishop of merida 350 miles 
southwest of caracas said in a recent telephone interview that in 
recent years more priests are being offered the gifts for personal 
gain or for use in charities 
but he said the church isnt sure the money should be turned 
down because some of the traffickers consider the donations 
retribution for their sins porras said 
the growing problem was one of the key issues discussed by 
venezuelan bishops during their annual episcopal conference which 
ended tuesday 
priests are being offered money and drugs primarily at the 
parish level this has been going on for several years now in latin 
america he said 
some see it is a way to launder money they dont know what 
else to do with but it is possible that the donation could be 
licit if it is for use in charities to forgive sins 
a spanishborn priest from a poor parish near caracas was 
arrested last april carrying 46 pounds of cocaine as he waited in 
maiquetia international airport outside caracas for a flight to 
madrid 
it was the first case in venezuela of a church official being 
arrested for involvement in the drug trade 
the priest who confessed he had made at least two previous 
trips to spain in which he carried and later sold drugs said he 
used the proceeds from the sales to pay for a new chapel 
improvements in the parish school and charity 
there is no doubt that money is one of the biggest temptations 
of this society and these are all charities that require money 
this is a human failing from which priests are not exempt 
porras said 
to accept it for the church is not correct any church works 
done using money derived from drugs cannot be consecrated he 
said but i think it could be acceptable for charities 
the bishop said knowledge of the offers is transmitted to higher 
church levels through confession and that pope john paul ii in 
rome has been informed of the matter through regular church 
channels 
the pope has not issued any specific instructions the bishop 
said 
to know whether the intention of the donor is good or bad is 
difficult he said 
meanwhile the church cannnot cooperate fully with law 
enforcement agencies because of the confidentiality of confession 
he said 
venezuelas justice minister pedro torres agudo met with the 
church officials during the five day episcopal conference but no 
formal agreement was reached between the church and the government 
he said 
there is no type of institutional help because of the position 
of the church on confidentiality he said 
instead he said the church is doing what it can to insist 
upon moral values and to help out needy families this is the labor 
we must do

twentyeight peace activists headed 
through mexico on their way to nicaragua still wondering why us 
officials suddenly stopped enforcing a trade embargo and let them 
drive across the rio grande 
its had a lot of us shaking our heads said gerry condon 
41 of santa cruz calif a coordinator of the veterans peace 
convoy 
the group cleared mexican customs stations thursday night with 
14 vehicles after the group paid about 650 for two escorts to 
accompany them to the guatemala border 
it feels great condon said after the convoy was cleared by 
mexican officials to leave nuevo laredo weve been ready to go 
for a long time we feel its a big victory even though we have 
far fewer people and vehicles than when we came down last month 
the us treasury department blocked the groups trucks from 
leaving the united states at least three times contending that 
taking the vehicles to nicaragua would violate a 3yearold trade 
embargo 
the government agrees the food and medical supplies qualify as 
humanitarian aid exempt from the nicaraguan trade control 
regulations but says the vehicles are not humanitarian aid convoy 
members refused to sign forms promising to return the trucks 
eight convoyistas were arrested saturday in a confrontation 
with officials at the border and one of the eight was rearrested 
early monday when customs again refused to let him cross 
but later monday the group said it started crossing vehicles 
and finally drove the last one across wednesday 
maybe they had a policy of going ahead and letting us slip 
across as long as we were quiet about it condon said there 
were times when people looked the other way and in fact in some 
cases there was nobody looking 
us customs spokeswoman donna de la torre in houston said the 
policy toward the convoy had not changed 
we do not routinely stop vehicles heading south ms de la 
torre said but if someone announces that theyll be violating 
the law well know about it and will be waiting for them she 
said 
she said three of the convoy drivers were allowed to cross 
because they told customs they were going to mexico 
the convoy cleared one mexican customs station thursday but at 
a second some firecrackers were confiscated by mexican 
authorities who insisted the vehicles have escorts escorts are 
required for people transporting imports through mexico customs 
officials said 
the convoy left a psychedelicpainted bus named peace 
train in nuevo laredo for a charity organization because they 
did not think it would make the trip 
the convoy first tried to cross the border at laredo in june 
with 38 vehicles and 106 people but were refused permission they 
returned to laredo last week with fewer people and vehicles 
because some members of the group had to return to work 
thirteen vehicles will stay in nicaragua they said and one 
will return

south korea today urged communist 
north korea to let students from both sides march across the 
divided peninsula in a pilgrimage to ease tension but the north 
refused to accept the proposal 
the souths education minister kim youngshik proposed that 
about 1000 students from each side should march north or south 
across the 600mile peninsula to build mutual trust and help open 
the way for normal relations 
it would help restore a sense of national trust and identity 
among the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateral 
nation exchanges kim said in a nationally broadcast speech 
but north korea notified the south thursday night that it would 
not accept a letter outlining the proposal a north korean 
statement monitored in tokyo said the plan would only be considered 
if seoul apologized for refusing to accept its last three official 
messages 
radical student groups in the south who have been pressing for 
reunification criticized the government proposal as a sham 
student leaders speaking on condition of anonymity said it was a 
bid to divert attention from unpopular government policies 
on june 10 the government used riot police to stop thousands of 
students marching to the border for talks with north korean student 
delegates 
on july 10 south korean president roh taewoo unveiled a plan 
to end the confrontation between the prowestern south and the 
communist north by broad political trade cultural and 
humanitarian exchanges roh said the plan could lead to eventual 
peaceful reunification 
but north korea rejected the roh proposal as pointless this 
is nothing new and not worth examination north korea said in a 
july 11 statement 
the two koreas have no relations and the border is sealed they 
technically are still at war since no peace treaty was signed at 
the end of the korean war in 1953 
both governments say they want reunfication but on their terms 
each side insists it is the only legitimate korean government and 
most observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations 
the education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by the 
end of july on a plan to allow about 1000 students from each 
nation to march sometime this year roh had said in june that he 
would call for student exchange visits with the north 
north korea has said there is no need for government involvement 
and student exchanges and meetings should be independent its 
position is designed to support radicals in the south even though 
any north korean student delegation would be under strict communist 
party control 
south korean students would march from the border across north 
korea to mount paektu on the chinese border while north korean 
students would march across the south to mount halla on the 
southern island of cheju 
the march could clear the way for sports events between colleges 
in the north and south involving about 200 students kim said the 
first sports event would be in pyongyang in october followed by a 
second sports meet in seoul next april he said 
if the first exchanges are a success kim said they could be 
expanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by students 
from both nations 
rohs proposals were similar or identical to past iniatives by 
both governments since 1971 on improving relations all failed to 
produce results the two koreas arranged smallscale family 
reunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985 
north korea which has staged a number of attacks on the south 
over the years is demanding to cohost the olympic games in seoul 
this september olympic authorities have rejected the demand and 
the north has said it will boycott the olympics 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by us and soviet 
forces that ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war 
ii the north invaded the south in 1950 to trigger the threeyear 
korean war

during a 1964 heart operation the diabetes unrelated to the 
hepatitis struck him when he was 20 
the man eventually would have died from his condition 
both he and his wife are a very strong couple 
psychologically hes doing very good tzakis said at a news 
conference thursday 
the man could have been saved with a new liver alone but 
doctors worried the single organ might have failed without a new 
pancreas to overcome the diabetes 
the pancreas a pearshaped organ behind the stomach produces 
insulin a hormone needed to convert sugar starches and other food 
into energy severe diabetes prevents the body from producing or 
properly using insulin making daily injections necessary 
complications include kidney and heart disease blindness nerve 
damage and gangrene leading to amputation tzakis patient had 
experienced only mild nerve damage and eye problems which studies 
show can sometimes be reversed 
our patient was an ideal candidate for this operation because 
he unfortunately suffered from both diabetes and hepatitis had the 
proper motivation to undergo a complicated procedure and understood 
the risk tzakis said 
the operation had been performed only twice before both times 
in england according to tzakis 
the patient was in serious condition thursday considered 
normal with the main threats being organ rejection or infection 
tzakis said he could be discharged in a month or so and remain 
near the hospital for another few weeks before returning home 
two other diabetics currently are awaiting liverpancreas 
transplants in pittsburgh according to tzakis

public interest in the earths troubled 
climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to 
end the current us drought weather experts warned during a 
drought symposium here 
society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria said pat 
michaels virginias state climatologist and moderator of the 
symposium 
he said the 1988 drought although not as dry as a 1986 drought 
in many places has drawn much attention because some of the 
affected areas include large media centers 
im worried that when the next drought happens we are 
going to have to rediscover the climate problem said michaels 
president of the association of state climatologists 
experts said thursday that the greenhouse effect the warming 
of the earths atmosphere has brought needed attention to changes 
in the global climate even though it is not directly related to 
the drought 
many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium 
agreed that the earths temperature is warming but they debated 
whether it is a short or longterm phenomenon and its impact on 
earth 
however alan hecht director of the national climate program in 
washington dc said the uncertainty means policymakers should 
begin to deal with the possible effects especially undertaking 
policies that make sense in their own right 
mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels he said by 
becoming more energy efficient replanting forests and 
investigating alternative energy supplies 
scientists have warned in recent years that earths atmosphere 
is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases which trap heat and 
cause the overall temperature to rise besides fossil fuels the 
depletion of forests in south america has been blamed for the 
increase of carbon dioxide and methane 
some have warned that higher temperature will change the 
character of many countries for example drying out the us 
midwest or melting polar ice caps 
the symposium was sponsored by the weather channel an 
atlantabased cable network which broadcast the meeting live 
earlier thursday the climatologists were told the movement of 
planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the 
southeast 
there is some evidence that as jupiter goes around the sun at 
its fastest point there are drought conditions in the southeast in 
the months of april and october georgia state climatologist 
gayther plummer said 
however david rodenhuis director of the federal climate 
analysis center in washington said he was skeptical of plummers 
thesis 
theres an enormous number of possibilities that one could 
chase rodenhuis said the next business of the scientist is to 
extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect

war criminals most of whom served in france authorities said 
willi dressen an official with the west german central office 
for the investigation of nazi war crimes said thursday he would 
turn over the names to cologne prosecutors soon 
dressen said the estimated 1500 names were obtained by his

nazi death camps and most of the suspects are former nazi secret 
police or security officials who worked in france dressen said 
hansjoachim roeseler a cologne prosecutor whose specialty is 
probing nazi war crimes said he was fighting against time and 
he expected the investigations to be extremely difficult 
many witnesses have already died or are not able to testify 
because of their age or are scattered around the world roeseler 
said 
officials did not say whether all the suspects were known to be 
still alive nor did they provide any details on any of the cases 
dressens office is responsible for initial investigations into 
suspected nazi war criminals and does not have prosecutorial powers 
if there is ground for further investigation and possible 
prosecution the cases are turned over to prosecuting authorities 
since the end of world war ii the ludwigsburgbased central 
office for the investigation of nazi crimes has carried out nearly 
100000 investigations with more than 6000 people convicted and

chinas leading daily said today the communist 
party regards the nationalist party on taiwan as its counterpart 
and expressed disappointment that a recent nationalist congress did 
not end a ban on contacts with the mainland 
the peoples daily the official voice of the party said in a 
frontpage editorial that the two parties have unshirkable 
duties to carry forth the great traditions of the chinese people 
what we can contribute to the future of our nation and mankind 
is unlimited we hope that the two parties can rid themselves of 
past differences and unite handinhand to achieve the cause that 
was left unfinished by our ancestors 
the communist and nationalist parties formed common fronts in 
the 1920s and 1930s to fight chinese warlords and the invading 
japanese but fought a civil war following the end of world war ii 
that ended in the flight of chiang kaisheks nationalists to 
taiwan in 1949 
the editorial said china highly appreciated the 13th 
nationalist party congress for dismissing the idea of an 
independent taiwan and calling for efforts to attain the historic 
task of reunification 
we believe that the trend of relaxing tensions will develop 
after the conclusion of the 13th party congress this is what the 
people of the two sides expect it said 
but the daily expressed disappointment that the nationalists 
made no change in their policies of regarding the communists as 
enemies and maintaining the three nos policy of no contact no 
negotiations and no compromise with the mainland 
this is really against the times and will of the people it 
said 
the nationalists while saying the ban on official contacts will 
stay did approve a plan to ease the ban on visits to taiwan by 
mainland chinese residents allow import of raw materials from 
china and permit taiwan business investment on the mainland if it 
is conducted through a third country 
last year the taipei government removed restrictions on visits 
to the mainland by taiwan residents tens of thousands of tourists 
businessmen and people visiting family have since traveled to the 
mainland 
the editorial also said the nationalists are unreasonable in 
their statements that the communist party and the people of the 
mainland should be separated 
the communist party it said has become one with the people of 
the mainland 
the daily said china continues to welcome people from taiwan for 
visits and business and expressed confidence that the policy of 
one country two systems can help reunify the nation 
under that system hong kong is to retain its capitalist system 
for 50 years after britain returns the colony to china in 1997

with a mixture of relief and jubilation prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative party today celebrated a 
narrow victory in the first special parliamentary election of her 
third term 
party chairman peter brooke hailed the tory win in west londons 
kensington district as a solid vote of confidence in the 
government and its policies 
energy secretary cecil parkinson said if there was a time for 
protest this was it and the opposition parties cold not 
capitalize on it 
he said the conservatives had done well considering this was 
the first chance for voters to protest mrs thatchers 
controversial third term program which includes an unpopular new 
property tax 
but voters in kensington where royal palaces and highrise 
tenements crowd into three square miles drastically cut the 
conservatives winning margin in the election thursday 
conservative candidate dudley fishburn was declared the winner 
with 9829 votes to 9014 for secondplaced labors ann holmes when 
results were announced early today 
the winning margin was 815 votes at the general election in 
june 1987 the conservatives winning margin over secondplaced 
labor in the 48500voter district was 4500 
the result was bad news for labor bookmakers heavily favored 
the conservatives to keep the kensington seat but many political 
commentators said labor had a good chance of victory due to 
widespread hostility to mrs thatchers latest policies 
since the 1987 general election her government has introduced 
laws to impose an unpopular new property tax shaken up the welfare 
system and ordered a review of the cherished national health 
service 
labor party leader neil kinnock on a swing through southern 
africa said in an interview with the british broadcasting corp 
from harare zimbabwe i was optimistic about the possibility of 
winning 
but he said the current contest for the labor leadership had 
helped damage the partys chances 
former labor cabinet minister tony benn a hardline leftist has 
issued a formal challenge to take over from kinnock as labor leader 
and the party is scheduled to vote on the issue this fall 
kinnock has renewed warnings to leftwing dissidents that labor 
must adapt its policies or risk a fourth successive general 
election defeat but in response benn has accused kinnock of 
seeking to water down labors antinuclear defense policy and its 
traditional demands for more state ownership 
the outcome of the kensington poll was also bad news for 
britains two centrist parties which paid the price for an 
acrimonious merger last spring of their former electoral alliance 
both the merged party the social and liberal democratic party 
and a breakaway social democratic party ran candidates splitting 
the already minority centrist vote 
the social and liberal democratic party candidate william 
goodhart trailed third with 2546 votes the social democratic 
party candidate john martin was fourth with 1190 votes 
the election of fishburn 42 an eton and harvardeducated 
former senior editor on the respected weekly the economist means 
that the conservatives huge 101seat majority over all the other 
parties combined in the 650seat house of commons remains unchanged 
the seat had been held for the conservatives for 20 years by 
legislator sir brandon rhys williams the election was caused by 
his death last november 
the lackluster campaign in kensington which contains thousand 
of highly transient apartment dwellers failed to excite local 
electors and only 51 percent voted 
the kensington constituency is one of the most starkly divided 
in britain in its southern part rows of elegant period houses 
belong to some of the wealthiest people in the country 
kensington palace is the london home of prince charles and 
princess diana charles aunt princess margaret and his cousin 
prince michael of kent also have apartments in the palace 
north kensington a high immigrant district is characterized by 
shabby streets of statesubsidized housing

the murder of a 19yearold black woman 
whose body had been scrawled with the letters kkk may have been 
racially motivated the ulster county district attorney says 
a racial motive obviously is a legitimate investigatory lead 
and were actively pursuing it michael kavanagh said thursday 
we dont know that the killing was racially inspired if it 
is racially inspired thats a horrible development 
the letters were scrawled on the body of anna kithcart 
apparently with a sharp instrument kavanagh said at a news 
conference miss kithcarts body was found tuesday on an abandoned 
railroad bed she was last seen monday evening 
there are certain parallels between the murder and the 
tawana brawley case but there was no evidence of a connection in 
the cases kavanagh said 
meanwhile the rev al sharpton an adviser to miss brawleys 
family said thursday that he and his associates would start their 
own investigation into whether there was any connection between the 
cases 
miss brawley 16 of wappingers falls was found last november 
with the letters kkk and racial epithets scrawled in a 
charcoallike substance on her skin after being missing for four 
days she later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of 
white men but she and her family have refused to cooperate with 
the investigation 
kingston is about 25 miles north of wappingers falls on the 
opposite shore of the hudson river 
the existence of the letters on miss kitchcarts body was 
withheld for more than two days to allow detectives time to 
question hundreds of people before the case attracted widespread 
attention said police chief james riggins 
i think that if we had announced this from the onset we would 
have had every nut in town calling us up riggins said 
riggins conferred with the fbi he said and was told the agency 
was unaware of any activities in the area by the ku klux klan or 
similar groups 
preliminary autopsy results indicated miss kithcart was 
strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument riggins 
said a bite on the neck and other marks also were found on her 
body 
meanwhile a man arrested wednesday on a misdemeanor charge for 
allegedly engaging in sexual conduct with miss kithcarts 
corpse remained in jail on 10000 bail police described the man 
joseph kiernan 41 as a transient 
the kingston daily freeman reported thursday that the young 
womans father eugene kithcart said he hadnt seen his daughter 
in two months and believed that she had fallen victim to drugs 
im almost positive it was a drug rub kithcart told the 
newspaper

facing a cash shortage because of curfews imposed by the israelis 
and strikes ordered by leaders of the arab uprising a united 
nations official said today 
the curfews also have disrupted food supplies to gaza the 
israeli newspaper haaretz reported today but the un official 
said there is no food shortage in the region where 650000 
palestinians live 
an 18yearold palestinian meanwhile was shot in the left leg 
today when soldiers clashed with moslem worshippers leaving a 
mosque in the bureij refugee camp in gaza a local reporter said 
an army spokesman had no information about the clash 
the youths hurled rocks at the troops who tried to disperse 
them with tear gas and rubber bullets and finally used live 
ammunition wounding the man who was identified as ayman taha the 
reporter said 
an 11yearold palestinian was shot in the leg late thursday in 
gazas shati refugee camp hospital officials and arab sources 
said they said the boy was shot when youths hurled rocks at 
soldiers who responded with tear gas and live gunfire 
 
but an army spokesman said the israeli army was not involved in 
the incident this is not an army matter this is a local police 
matter and thats all im going to say he said 
the gaza police spokesman was not in his office for comment but 
a policeman who answered the telephone at gaza police headquarters 
said he knew nothing of the incident 
since the arab uprising began seven months ago 222 palestinians 
and four israelis have been killed

a united nations official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said similar restrictions were imposed on the bureij refugee camp 
in gaza where the army imposed a 15day curfew last month after 
the local arab municipality resigned 
workers were barred from leaving to work in israel for almost 
six weeks resulting in a cash shortage the un official said 
curfews have been lifted in all gaza camps but strikes ordered 
by underground palestinian leaders also have prevented workers from 
reaching their jobs the official said 
nevertheless un food trucks delivering basic food products 
were continuing to arrive as scheduled the official said 
there is no food shortage in gaza what youve got is 
shortages of money the un source said 
the haaretz newspaper quoted an israeli reserve soldier as 
saying in the past few days i have given out watermelons 
cantaloupes and some even come and beg me for bread we know there 
is a severe food shortage in the camps

in a day of fraught sometimes rambling 
testimony wedtech corp founder john mariotta said illiteracy kept 
him from knowing about the illegal goingson at his scandalplagued 
company 
my reading ability will go as far as a comic book is 
concerned dont try to tell me to read the new york times or any 
technical thing thats not my game mariotta 58 testified 
thursday at his racketeering trial 
once hailed by president reagan as a hero for the 80s 
mariotta is on trial with rep mario biaggi dbronx and five 
others on charges of turning wedtech into a racketeering enterprise 
that paid out millions in bribes to obtain government contracts 
mariotta denied those allegations but it was his wideranging 
streamofconsciousness responses to his attorneys questions 
accompanied by fistpounding handwringing and fingerwaving that 
provided the courtroom drama 
mariotta the son of puerto rican immigrants has claimed he is 
virtually illiterate and that other company executives kept him in 
the dark about their illegal activities 
my writing ability is nil said mariotta lives in 
scarsdale a wealthy new york suburb for 20 years you could look 
at my companys records you will not find one letter or any 
documentation or anything in my handwriting 
asked if he finished high school mariotta who grew up in new 
yorks spanish harlem spoke of his parents fights over his 
fathers drinking nights spent riding the subways with his mother 
runins with truant officers and his difficulties taking tests 
assistant us attorney mary shannon complained to the judge 
that mariotta was telling stories irrelevant to his lawyers 
questions 
with jurors out of the room she asked us district judge 
constance baker motley to make mariotta stick to the questions 
asked and not go off on these tangents designed to evoke sympathy 
from the jury 
mariotta piped up your honor im not an intellectual like 
these people seem to think that i am i am not i am emotionally 
upset because it took me 20 years to build this company and you 
intellectuals robbed my company from me 
during the disjointed testimony mariotta denied giving wedtech 
stock to biaggi in exchange for the congressmans help in obtaining 
nobid government contracts 
four former wedtech executives have pleaded guilty to state and 
federal crimes ranging from bribery to fraud and testified for the 
government in return for leniency they and other witnesses have 
said mariotta helped create a multimilliondollar company slush 
fund for bribes payoffs and offthebooks luxuries 
wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a 100 million 
defense contractor through a small business administration program 
that awarded government contracts to minorityowned businesses 
without competitive bidding 
prosecutors charge that mariotta concealed from the sba that he 
no longer controlled the company but mariotta insisted he was the 
dupe of greedy men who later forced him out 
in 1984 reagan lauded wedtech for its hiring of rehabilitated 
drug addicts exconvicts and former welfare recipients 
in 1986 after mariotta was forced out the bronx company shut 
its doors and filed for bankruptcy

it was just a case of desperately wanting a baby said fbi 
agent roger nicely 
the infant was swiped from a maternity ward crib at cabell 
huntington hospital on tuesday by a woman in a nurses uniform 
the baby was reunited with her parents linda and donald manns 
of harts creek early thursday after german returned the child to 
the hospital in good health 
its just an answer to our prayers to the lord that got her 
back for us said manns 23 a coal truck driver 
it was just the happiest time of my life to see my baby 
again said mrs manns 
germans relatives called a special hospital hotline wednesday 
night and german followed with her own call telling fbi agents her 
relatives did not believe the infant was her own authorities said 
she wanted to come in with the baby to prove to her mother and 
her stepfather it was her baby said assistant us attorney 
joseph savage 
german arrived at the hospital with the baby wednesday night and 
told fbi agents she had given birth in early july at a lexington 
ky hospital savage said 
a call to the hospital found no record of the birth and a 
doctors exam concluded she had not given birth recently savage 
said 
german was taken into the room from which the infant was 
abducted and began to cry and admitted she remembered taking a 
baby but was unable to remember what she did after she took the 
baby or what hospital she took the baby from fbi agent james 
kessler said in court papers 
i realize now that this is not my baby fbi agents quoted 
german as saying 
german worked at wuxatv in portsmouth ohio as office manager 
and secretary to general manager tom watson she looked pregnant 
to me he said she came into the office yesterday with the 
baby and showed it to the staff 
watson said german who joined the station in march called july 
6 to say she was taking maternity leave german called the infant 
lauren gray 
we were shocked and very sad and my heart our hearts go out 
to her watson said she is a nice softspoken person and very 
capable obviously she thought it was her baby 
watson said german who has a 3yearold daughter had a 
history of miscarriages and might have lost her own baby savage 
told a us magistrate he believed german had faked her pregnancy 
since december 
the federal kidnapping charge carries a maximum life sentence 
he said german was believed to have been involved in an 
attempted abduction of another baby born at the same hospital 
in that case a marrowbone creek woman told police that after 
she gave birth a stranger visited her at home brandished a knife 
and threatened to take the baby before family members stepped in 
and the woman fled

former mayor and exklan leader james 
r venable says he is appreciative but wants no part of the citys 
effort to name a park for him on land he donated 
city council voted tuesday to name a park for venable former 
imperial wizard of the national knights of the ku klux klan in a 
move that came under criticism from the naacp and the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
i appreciate it venable said wednesday but i wouldnt 
want any credit for it 
robert smith one of the citys two black council members 
favored the move saying venables past affiliation with the klan 
was not my concern 
i was born here and he was not the only one who did not like 
blacks here smith said 
nickie taylor the receptionist at city hall said the phone 
rang steadily thursday weve had people say they wont come into 
our city now she said 
i think its awful said coleman seward vice president of 
the dekalb county branch of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
im not saying venable shouldnt be honored in some way but 
not by a public park i wouldnt go to a park with his name on 
it seward said 
gloria brown head of a black civic organization here did not 
object we all use the park blacks on the little league enjoy it 
just like the whites i think its wonderful regardless of his 
views she said 
if hes generous enough to donate the land i dont think its 
unusual that the park was named for him said ralph shipp a 
black resident of stone mountain 
stewart lewengrub director of the southeast region office of 
the antidefamation league wrote mayor jane rhodes asking the 
council to reverse its decision 
the fact that venable donated the land does not justify naming 
the park for him lewengrub said in a statement if charles 
manson had donated the land would they have named the park for 
him

clergymen scholars and survivors of the holocaust 
today applauded a message from west german chancellor helmut kohl 
acknowledging his nations responsibility for the nazi genocide 
germans became guilty of that crime as individuals but they 
are collectively liable for the injustice committed in their 
name said kohls message read to 500 people attending 
remembering for the future a conference on the holocaust and 
its impact on modern generations 
kohl joined president reagan british prime minister margaret 
thatcher french president francois mitterrand israeli president 
chaim herzog and european economic community head jacques delors in 
sending messages to the conference on its final day 
the west german leaders words were read by robert maxwell the 
czechborn jewish publisher who sponsored the weeklong conference 
maxwell lauded west germanys willingness to face its past and at 
his request kohl was given a round of applause 
no one can rule out the possibility of comparable atrocities 
happening again said kohls message it must not be forgotten 
it is an appeal to each one of us to examine our own thoughts over 
and over again 
it said we germans are prepared to live with this terrible 
truth 
reagans message said the world can never have reminders 
enough about the tragedy that results when nations abandon their 
reverence for the sanctity of every human life 
more than 500 scholars concentration camp survivors 
theologians artists and teachers met here to examine how 
christianity could have allowed the holocaust to happen 
the words never again must ever be the pledge of all who 
pause in remembrance of those who have perished and of all who 
cherish mankinds deepest hopes and ideals reagan said in his 
message 
the conference which began in oxford a week ago concludes with 
leaders of christian churches joining in prayers for the 6 million 
jewish victims of nazi germanys genocide during world war ii 
boston university professor elie wiesel a nobel prizewinning 
author and survivor of the buchenwald concentration camp where 
10000 people died daily said that after a lifetime of studying 
and writing about the holocaust he still could not understand how 
it happened 
often i think of the children walking slowly quietly 
obediently to the flames or to the mass graves and i am almost 
grateful for the pain that links my memory to theirs he said in 
a keynote address 
the conference ranked among the biggest of its kind held outside 
the united states where there has been an expansion in academic 
studies of the holocaust 
maxwell 65 lost most of his family at the hands of the nazis 
in world war ii 
this crime this disaster has been examined mainly in the 
united states maxwell said thursday yet it was in europe that 
it happened 
maxwells wife elisabeth a french protestant was the main 
organizer of the conference as a child she lived in a largely 
jewish district of paris from which most her friends vanished as 
the nazis rounded up the jews 
she has long believed that christianity contained a strong 
streak of antisemitism 
the jewish chronicle britains top jewish newspaper has 
predicted that the conference could radically affect the way 
british people and institutions think about the holocaust 
herzog in his message said he hoped the meeting would help 
to shape a future in which the horror will never be forgotten 
mrs thatcher said it was important for generations who did not 
live through those agonized years to learn how and why it 
happened 
that knowledge will help people everywhere who are determined 
that nothing like this shall ever happen again she added in her 
message to the conference 
organizers timed the meeting just before next weeks lambeth

nevadas supreme court which banned 
use of police decoys who pose as drunks with cash hanging from 
their pockets says its ok if the decoy is alert welldressed and 
more of a logical target for thieves 
the high court thursday rejected an appeal from vincent 
depasquale convicted in las vegas of larceny after a police decoy 
operation in 1983 
a plainclothes policewoman was used as a decoy carrying a 
shoulder bag in which a fake 100 bill was exposed a zipper pulled 
tight against the money depasquale claimed entrapment 
the supreme court said it has ruled against use of decoys when 
they pose as anyone who is helpless drunk or feigning 
unconsciousness with money exposed temptingly from pockets 
that degree of vulnerability suggested entrapment or 
inducing someone to commit a crime he might not otherwise commit 
the court said 
in the depasquale case however the exposed valuables were 
presented in a realistic situation an alert and welldressed woman 
walking on the open sidewalks in the casino area the court said 
the fact that the money was exposed simply presented a 
generally identified social predator with a logical target the 
court added these facts suggest that depasquale was predisposed 
to commit this crime

secretary of state george shultz said today that 
china made no promises to stop ballistic missiles sales to the 
middle east but he said the united states should not stop the flow 
of high technology to china in response 
we didnt come to any agreements about it missile sales but 
im sure that the subject will continue to be an important one 
on our agenda shultz told reporters after meeting with senior 
leader deng xiaoping communist party chief zhao ziyang and premier 
li peng 
when asked about news reports of a chinesesyrian missile deal 
shultz said chinese leaders told him their only ballistic missile 
sales in the middle east have been to saudi arabia 
the los angeles times reported thursday that an agreement was 
consummated under which beijing would sell intermediaterange 
m9 missiles to syria 
senior us administration officials traveling with shultz have 
said the chinese are believed to be marketing the weapons which 
have a maximum range of about 370 miles but that us officials 
have no indications of a sale 
the officials say the m9 which is potentially capable of 
striking targets in israel from syria is at least nine months away 
from production 
more than 100 us congressmen sent shultz a cable thursday 
warning that future transfer of us high technology to china would 
be jeopardized if the sale to syria went through 
shultz said he got word of the cable only after his meetings 
with top chinese leaders but added i think the way to try to 
get at it with the chinese is other kinds of constructive ways 
angry over alleged chinese sales of antiship silkworm missiles 
to iran washington last fall temporarily froze some high 
technology sales to china the united states has also been critical 
of beijings sale this spring of intermediate range css2 or east 
wind missiles to saudi arabia 
in his meeting with shultz today deng said the united states 
and china should bring their relationship to a higher plane 
the 84yearold senior leader said relations between the united 
states and china have improved steadily during president reagans 
term although of course there are still some problems between 
us 
shultz held closeddoor talks with li and zhao it was his 
second day in beijing on saturday he flies to seoul south korea 
the seventh stop on a ninecountry trip through asia and the 
pacific 
discussions here focused largely on missile sales and the khmer 
rouge the chinesebacked cambodian guerrillas who some fear may 
muscle their way back into power if vietnam pulls its troops out of 
cambodia 
the khmer rouge massacred hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
after it took power in 1975 vietnam ousted them when it invaded in 
1978 
shultz said the united states and china have a very broad 
agreement as to certain aspects of that situation including 
rather similar views on stopping a khmer rouge return to power 
china officially supports a threeparty cambodian opposition 
coalition that includes the khmer rouge 
us sources said foreign minister qian qichen told shultz on 
thursday that senior khmer rouge leaders may retire 
shultz said both countries are pressing for a total withdrawal 
of vietnamese troops and both view noncommunist prince norodom 
sihanouk as the central figure in a future cambodian government 
sihanouk abruptly resigned this week as head of the antivietnamese 
coalition 
sihanouk and several others proposed a peacekeeping force to 
ensure a ceasefire the peaceful formation of a government and 
free elections in cambodia 
vietnam pledged to remove all its troops currently estimated at 
120000 by us sources by 1990 this has sparked fears that the 
khmer rouge would shoulder aside their two less powerful 
noncommunist allies in the antivietnamese coalition and seize 
power once hanois forces have left

the conflict

drug deals were made in a restricted 
plutonium building at the lawrence livermore nuclear weapons 
laboratory in 1986 the lab director disclosed 
john nuckolls made the disclosure to the university of 
california regents in a report thursday on an undercover drug probe 
dubbed operation snowstorm at the facility 
the university operates livermore and two other weapons 
laboratories under a contract with the government livermore near 
san francisco conducts highly sensitive research on the star 
wars missile defense system 
as a result of the undercover operation four contract workers 
and two lab employees were arrested on drug charges and 
successfully prosecuted nuckolls said 
the total drug purchases amounted to less than 1000 nuckolls 
said small amounts of methamphetamine cocaine and marijuana were 
purchased both on and off the laboratory site during the 1986 probe 
two of the individuals prosecuted had what the lab director 
termed qclearances giving them access to certain topsecret 
buildings and materials 
one of those with top security clearance made drug deliveries in 
the supersensitive plutonium building nuckolls said 
lab management and energy department officials have been under 
criticism accused of terminating the investigation prematurely 
the laboratorys security investigators and the undercover 
officer strongly opposed the decision to terminate the probe in 
september 1986 nuckolls said 
the us drug enforcement administration which participated in 
the investigation also opposed the decision said nuckolls who 
was appointed director in april 
energy undersecretary joseph f salgado told a house 
investigative subcommittee last month that officials decided to 
terminate the investigation because it had run for eight months 
and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads 
he said the operation had served its purpose in putting 
livermore employees on notice that drug use would not be tolerated 
in addition to the six workers prosecuted 10 others including 
five with qclearances resigned when confronted with evidence of 
illegal drug activities nuckolls said 
nuckolls said allegations also were gathered on 36 additional 
workers but an internal review found insufficient information to 
warrant disciplinary action 
the lab director said two followup reviews concluded that 
operation snowstorm was conducted professionally and competently 
nuckolls acknowledged that a review by congress was sharply 
critical 
the house subcommittee has asked the general accounting office 
to review how effectively the lab controls government property 
including classified documents high explosives and nuclear 
material

iran is building a new oil 
platform in the persian gulf and sophisticated equipment being 
installed behind its armor plating could spell more trouble for 
shipping shipping executives said today 
the platform will have landing pads big enough to handle two 
large helicopters and one small one at the same time the 
executives said it also is being reinforced with steel plating 
they said 
the executives who spoke on condition on anonymity quoted 
iranian officials as saying the platform will become a base for 
irans fleet of oil shuttle tankers serving the larak island export 
terminal in the strait of hormuz 
but some shipping industry experts say it also could be intended 
for military purposes including the electronic monitoring of 
shipping traffic and warships traveling through the strait where 
some iranian attacks on neutral shipping occur 
iran used drilling rigs as military communications bases in the 
past according to us officials three have been destroyed or 
damaged in attacks by american warships one in october and two 
more on april 18 
the attacks in each case were in retaliation for iranian 
military actions against americanrelated ships and aircraft in the 
gulf us officials said 
abc television reported that the new triangularshaped rig will 
be capable of coordinating sea and airborne attacks upon the us 
navy and refueling helicopter gunships and patrol boats 
the shipping executives said the facilities including cabins 
for about 200 workers should be completed in 45 days 
some shipping industry officials expressed skepticism that the 
platform was for military use 
the term armorplated is exaggerated they are reinforcing it 
with steel but they are not turning it into a tank said one he 
added that the iranians probably would arm it with antiaircraft 
guns as they have other oil platforms in the gulf 
foreign tankers pick up oil cargoes brought to larak island from 
kharg island in the northern gulf by irans fleet of stateowned 
and chartered tankers 
despite being nearly 1000 miles from iraqi bases iraq raided 
larak several times its most recent attack was may 14 when 
warplanes wrecked a spanish tanker and damaged four others 
including two huge ships used to store and transfer oil to other 
tankers

wholesale prices one step short of retail rose 
a moderate 04 percent in june the government said today but the 
drought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaring 
at their steepest pace in more than 2 years 
the labor department said raw costs jumped 42 percent last 
month a rate not seen since the 51 percent climb of october 1985 
further along in the wholesale process however prices for foods 
ready to be retailed rose 11 percent reflecting earlier though 
less severe increases in raw food costs 
some examples of price increases at the unprocessedfood level 
wheat 253 percent 
corn 243 percent 
turkeys 228 percent 
soybeans 220 percent 
chickens 225 percent 
reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animals 
they cannot afford or find feed for cattle prices fell 52 percent 
while hog prices were down 40 percent 
the news was not quite so severe at the finishedgoods level 
prices for eggs rose 160 percent while turkey prices gained 93 
percent chicken prices jumped 73 percent and fresh fruit costs 
gained 67 percent 
those gains were partially offset by a 57 percent decline in 
vegetable prices and a 22 percent decrease for rice 
stacy kottman an economist at georgia state university said 
that prices of foods made from grain such a vegetable oils bakery 
products and pasta likely will continue to rise and that the drop 
in vegetable prices wont last meat prices should continue to fall 
through late autumn but will then head higher after the 
droughtinduced slaughtering tails off he said 
next year well probably see the full impact of the drought 
particularly if it persists up until this week we could say 
well if we get some rain well probably be all right but this 
week is the last week we can say that he said 
energy prices meanwhile fell at the finished level by 16 
percent leading the way was a drop of 71 percent for fuel oil 
while declines of 24 percent and 10 percent were posted for 
gasoline and natural gas respectively 
further energy price declines are considered likely because 
crude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowest 
levels in nearly two years 
we can just thank our fortunes that opec cant get together on 
restraint of production i hate to think what the report would look 
like if oil prices were rising kottman said 
in other economic news 
the commerce department said the us trade deficit rose 
slightly in may to 109 billion but the imbalance was still the 
second smallest in almost three years the gap between imports and 
exports widened by 627 million from a revised april imbalance of 
103 billion 
the federal reserve board said production at the nations 
factories mines and utilities rose a moderate 04 percent in june 
the ninth consecutive month without a decline the june increase 
boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave 
pushed industrial output 58 percent higher than it was a year ago 
business inventories in may rose a moderate 06 percent to 
7284 billion held in check by a 09 percent jump in sales to 
4837 billion the commerce department said 
overall if the june increase in wholesale finished goods prices 
held for 12 straight months the inflation rate would be 46 
percent annually more than double the 22 percent rise of 1987 
subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices 
wholesale prices rose 03 percent last month 
analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economys 
underlying inflation even with steep food price gains anticipated 
for the several months many economists feel the effect of those 
gains will be only temporary 
for the first half of 1988 prices one step short of retail rose 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 36 percent excluding food 
and energy prices wholesale costs rose 40 over that period 
prices from march through june have risen at a monthly rate of 
either 04 percent or 05 percent 
at the finished level the department gave these other price 
changes 
passenger car prices up 10 percent 
womens clothing up 10 percent 
home electronic equipment down 22 percent 
cosmetics down 06 percent 
the june increase brought the wholesale price index for finished 
goods to 1079 meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods 
costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 10790 last month 40 cents 
more than in may 
this calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations as are 
other calculations in the report 
the consumer price index which tracks services and imported 
goods not included in the wholesale price report has risen at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 44 percent over the first five 
months of the year the same rate as for all of 19878 
consumer price figures for june will be released next week

wednesday not to hold any meetings in panama until the political 
unrest in that country settles down 
the united states is seeking the ouster of panamanian leader 
gen manuel antonio noriega who is under indictment on drug 
charges in florida 
the board also approved a 500 million budget for the upcoming 
year a slight increase from the previous year gianelli said the 
budget now goes to the federal office of management and budget for 
approval 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter said earlier this month 
that panamanian representatives will not attend any meetings of the 
board until the united states normalizes relations with panama 
and recognizes nominees of the noriega government 
the us president appoints the board members including the 
panamanians who are nominated by the panamanian government 
noriega also was upset when the canal board canceled a meeting 
scheduled for last april in panama gianelli said 
gianelli said panamas boycott of the meetings and the countrys 
interference in the operation of the canal are diminishing hopes 
for a smooth transition to panamanian ownership at the end of the 
century 
panama is interfering by not allowing panamanian canal 
administrative staff members to attend the meeting and by 
forbidding panamanian staff to travel to the united states to learn 
how to run the canal gianelli said 
panama has said it will not recognize any action taken by the 
canal board members here 
but gianelli said any decisions taken by the board without the 
votes of the panamanian directors will be binding on the canal 
operation because the commission is a us government agency

iranian gunboats struck a 
liberianregistered tanker in the persian gulf today and returned 
twice more to attack it after the captain called for help from us 
warships gulfbased shipping executives said 
the us missile frigate robert g bradley responded to the 
distress signal but did not confront the raiders us officials 
said 
the shipping executives identified the targeted vessel as the 
85989ton sea victory operated by the piraeus greecebased 
european navigation inc they said the captain put out his distress 
signal at about 2 pm and gave his location as five miles south of 
farsi island the captain said the attack was carried out by two 
iranian gunboats 
he was heard frantically shouting american warship americans 
warship and within minutes he reported that the gunboats were 
returning to attack said the executives who monitored the 
radio calls 
the captain was still shouting for help when the gunboats 
returned a third time to raid the vessel said the executives they 
said the attacks occurred within about 15 minutes 
the attacks caused a fire which the crew extinguished 
in a radio telephone contact after the iranians turned back the 
captain was overheard by monitors as saying the iranians attacked 
three times and he described the condition of his ship as covered 
with lots of holes 
he was overheard saying no casualties thank god but he 
also said that his second officer suffered minor injuries 
in washington the pentagon said in a statement that the tanker 
issued a call for help but was able to steam west under its own 
power when it reached international waters it no longer required 
assistance the statement said 
a us navy spokesman in the gulf who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the frigate robert g bradley was on patrol in the 
gulf more than 20 miles away and responded to the call and headed 
toward the tanker 
the iranian gunboats did not pursue the tanker into 
international waters said the spokesman 
the shipping executives who also spoke on condition they not be 
named noted that the us warship would not cross the 12mile 
territorial limit around farsi which would be iranian waters 
under the existing rules of engagement for the navy vessels in 
distress can be assisted only in international waters 
since may 3 the navy rules of engagement have been expanded to 
permit us warships to intervene to stop attacks on neutral 
shipping in international waters if the ships under attack are not 
carrying warrelated materials and if they ask for assistance 
it was the second raid by the iranian gunboats in four days on a 
tanker in the vicinity of farsi a stronghold for irans 
paramilitary revolutionary guards 
about 550 commercial vessels of different nationalities have 
been caught in the tanker war iraq attacks ships sailing in 
iranian waters and iran retaliates by raiding neutral shipping 
particularly vessels linked to kuwait or saudi arabia 
iran accuses the two countries of aiding iraq its foe in the 
nearly 8yearold war 
on tuesday the iranian gunboats raided a panamanianregistered 
tanker the 81282ton universal monarch about 20 miles off farsi 
setting its engine room ablaze and causing extensive flooding 
the missile frigate nicholas on patrol in the area had rushed 
to the assistance of the vessel and two of its helicopters took 
fire from the raiding gunboats no casualties were reported 
the raids on the universal monarch and the sea victory were 
irans apparent retaliations for iraqi strikes on two tankers the 
greekowned fellowship l and the cypriot star ray a few days 
earlier in the vicinity of irans vital kharg island oil terminal 
also in the northern part of the gulf

charging that the striking writers guild of america is unlawfully 
preventing members from leaving the union and returning to work

a federal appeals court today sided with the city 
of atlanta in a dispute with demonstrators who wanted to march on a 
street adjacent to the democratic national convention site 
alternative 88 a coalition of protest groups planning to 
demonstrate during the convention next week went to court after 
the city refused to allow parades on marietta street adjacent to 
the convention site 
us district judge orinda evans ruled last week that the city 
has a significant government interest in guaranteeing delegates 
access to the convention and therefore was justified in barring 
parades outside the omni hotel and the georgia world congress 
center 
the coalition appealed to the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals arguing that if traffic problems can be a compelling 
reason for limiting demonstrations then in fact the sidewalks 
and streets are not held in trust for the use of the public 
the appeals court today upheld the lower courts ruling noting 
the city had given permission for demonstrators to march within one 
block of the convention site 
the visibility of the parade from the actual convention site 
is not significantly diminished by holding it a block away the 
court said

former president richard nixon says if michael 
dukakis can team up with someone as philosophically different from 
him as lloyd bentsen then george bush should be able to patch up 
any differences with bob dole 
nixon in a memo to the bush campaign recommends dole as a 
running mate for bush the certain republican nominee however the 
former president also has kind words for rep jack kemp of new york 
and california gov george deukmejian calling them strong 
choices 
a copy of the note from the former president who lives in 
saddle river nj was made available to the associated press 
nixon spokesman john taylor confirmed nixon wrote it for bushs 
key strategists 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said he received the memo late 
thursday 
im reading it with great interest atwater said 
if dukakis and bentsen with diametrically different views on 
key issues can get together dole and bush who have no 
significant philosophical differences can get together too 
nixon wrote adding compared to the democratic ticket they 
would look like siamese twins 
bush and dole had some harsh exchanges back when they were 
rivals for the republican presidential nomination but nixon says 
even if the pundits say bush and dole dont get along the two 
have a similar outlook and would make an effective team 
by contrast he wrote differences between dukakis the governor 
of massachusetts and bentsen the texas senator run to the 
heart of virtually every major economic social and foreignpolicy 
issue 
one is tall the other is short nixon begins ticking off 
what he views as dukakisbentsen differences on such issues as tax 
cuts gun control and aid to the nicaraguan rebels the two are as 
politically polarized as dukakis and bush the former president 
wrote 
nixon brushed aside comparisons between the dukakisbentsen 
ticket and the 1960 massachusetts combination of john f kennedy 
and lyndon b johnson which beat the ticket of nixon and henry 
cabot lodge 
they overlook a profound and obvious difference nixon said 
kennedy and johnson were both mainstream democrats 
he accused the democrats of being willing to bury their 
differences even if it means burying their principles in order to 
have a shot at winning texas which he called the big enchilada 
nixon described bentsen as a mainstream democrat but said 
dukakis definitely is not 
he is a cardcarrying member of the mcgovernmondale wing of 
the democratic party nixon said of the democratic nominee 
referring to former vice president walter mondale and former sen 
george mcgovern of south dakota whom nixon beat in 1972 
the former president said the dukakis camp was inept in 
failing to reach jackson and tell him of bentsens selection before 
the word got out but he said it will be in jacksons own political 
interests to stage a reconciliation with the dukakis camp 
in an aside nixon described jackson as a firebreathing 
radical who has put on a threepiece suit and run for 
president

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
leaders of the six other warsaw pact nations today began a twoday 
summit expected to focus on disarmament and eastwest dialogue 
the meeting provided gorbachev a showcase to inform his fellow 
communist leaders in eastern europe on the latest developments in 
soviet perestroika or restructuring 
it was the first of the warsaw treaty organization 
politicalconsultative council since gorbachev and president reagan 
held their summit in moscow in early june 
the leaders met in closed session and issued no information on 
their deliberations while they met gorbachevs wife raisa 
traveled to southern poland to the former nazi death camp at 
auschwitzbirkenau and placed flowers there in memory of the 4 
million people who died at the camp 
the camp about 140 miles southeast of warsaw was liberated by 
the soviet red army on jan 27 1945 
in june reagan and gorbachev exchanged ratified copies of a 
treaty to ban short and intermediaterange nuclear weapons most 
of which are deployed in europe 
with the accord settled attention has shifted to longstalled 
talks to reduce conventional forces in europe gorbachev has 
indicated that would be a top item on the warsaw pact leaders 
agenda 
the pact meeting should point out the warsaw treatys 
priorities in disarmament said a commentary thursday in the 
official polish daily zycie warszawy 
conventional arms talks resume in vienna this fall and 
gorbachev suggested in poland on monday that informal talks be held 
to search for a new starting point that could lead to progress 
poland and the ussr as parties to the warsaw treaty 
attach special importance to the quickest possible inauguration of 
negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional 
armaments in europe said a joint polishsoviet communique issued 
thursday 
both countries favor removing disproportions in this area 
and are ready for a realistic and constructive dialogue the 
communique added 
the north atlantic treaty organization contends the east bloc 
holds a dangerous 2to1 advantage in tanks artillery and armored 
personel carriers deployed near the borders separating east and 
west europe 
in a speech to parliament on monday the first day of his 
sixday visit to poland gorbachev proposed withdrawing an 
unspecified number of analagous warsaw pact air forces if nato 
agreed not to deploy 72 usbuilt f16 fighterjets in italy 
the soviet union has proposed that all armies leave foreign 
territories across europe by the year 2000 
it was warsaws turn to host the annual session held in the 
stately council of ministers palace where the warsaw treaty was 
signed in 1955 
five east bloc leaders arrived in warsaw on thursday joining 
gorbachev and polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski they are 
nicholae ceaucescu of romania milos jakes of czechoslovakia todor 
zhivkov of bulgaria erich honnecker of east germany and newly 
appointed karoly grosz of hungary 
the pact has been going through a period of ferment in recent 
year partially as a result of gorbachevs reform policies and his 
emphasis that each member country is free to choose its own path 
toward restructuring 
poland and hungary are enthusiastic backers of reform 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria take a cautious approach while east 
germany shows only grudging interest in conducting similar reforms 
romania where ceaucescu continues to wield great centralized 
control is conspicuously out of step with the reform trend

the us trade deficit rose slightly in may to 
109 billion but the imbalance was still the second smallest in 
almost three years the government said today the good news sent 
the dollar soaring on foreign currency markets 
the commerce department reported that the gap between imports 
and what america sells overseas widened by 627 million from a 
revised april imbalance of 103 billion 
the revised april trade deficit was the best showing since a 
99 billion deficit in august 1985 and the new figure for may is 
the second best performance since that time 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the report 
represents good news in the continuing trend of reducing the 
international trade deficit 
there is less deterioriation there than the markets had 
expected so the market reaction should be favorable fitzwater 
said 
financial markets which have been thrown into a tailspin by bad 
trade figures over the past year reacted favorably to the good 
news the dollar rose almost one cent against the british pound and 
nearly one japanese yen in london trading immediately after the 
trade figures were reported 
jay goldinger an analyst with capital insight a los angeles 
investment firm said the slight widening in the deficit for may 
had been expected because the april number was held back by an 
unusually low import figure he predicted the trade deficit would 
move into single digits in coming months as the countrys trade 
problem continues to show improvement after seven consecutive years 
of steady deterioration 
after the last few months of volatile movements it was nice 
to see only a small change he said we should have smooth 
sailing for the rest of the year 
imports did rise in may compared to april climbing 34 percent 
to 376 billion but this increase was offset by a 23 percent 
increase in us exports which rose to 266 billion very close 
to the record level for exports set in march 
analysts said the may trade figure was welcome news proving 
that sharp drops in the deficit in march and april were not flukes 
the figures were also good news for the reagan administration 
which is counting on strong export growth to propel the economy in 
this presidential election year 
for the first five months of the year the us trade deficit 
after adjusting for normal seasonal variations has been running at 
an annual rate of 1407 billion down substantially from the 
record deficit of 1703 billion run up last year 
the improvement has come from a boom in export sales which for 
the first five months of this year are running a remarkable 304 
percent above the same period in 1987 imports were also up by 114 
percent during the same period reflecting in part price increases 
caused by the decline in the value of the dollar over the past 
three years 
the administration in 1985 embarked on a coordinated strategy 
with other major industrial countries of devaluing the dollar as a 
way of curing the countrys trade problems 
a weak dollar makes american goods cheaper and thus more 
competitive on overseas markets while making imports more expensive 
for american consumers 
the strategy took much longer than expected to show benefits 
but the administration is confident that the trade imbalance for 
1988 will decline marking the first annual improvement in eight 
years 
the increase in exports in may reflected a 03 billion rise in 
agricultural shipments a 03 billion advance in sales of capital 
goods and a 01 billion rise in sales of american autos and parts 
overseas 
the rise in imports reflected increases of 11 billion in 
industrial supplies and smaller rises in imports of capital goods 
imports of autos fell by 06 billion during the month 
oil imports rose 177 percent during the month to 39 billion 
by country the biggest deficit as usual was with japan an 
imbalance of 41 billion down slightly from the april imbalance 
of 44 billion 
the substantial trade improvement has been a key factor in the 
betterthanexpected economic growth the country has enjoyed so far 
this year us manufacturing has been enjoying boom times because 
of a surge in export sales 
the growth in manufacturing jobs helped to push the unemployment 
rate down to a 14year low of 53 percent in june 
many economists believe almost half of the economys growth this 
year will come from an improving trade performance 
david wyss senior financial economist for data resources inc 
said that he was not concerned that recent increases in the value 
of the dollar would slow the longterm trend for an improving trade 
deficit he said he expects the dollar will resume its downward 
progress in coming months

president reagan today applauded overwhelming 
house and senate votes condemning sandinista leaders for human 
rights abuses and urged congress to approve swiftly further aid for 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking for the 
president said reagan is pleased with the overwhelming 
bipartisan votes on the issue 
these votes send the message to the sandinistas that the 
united states is firmly committed to the achievement of freedom and 
democracy in nicaragua fitzwater said 
the sandinistas conduct makes clear that they will not 
institute democratic reform and cease their threats to the security 
of central america unless effectively pressured and persuaded to do 
so the spokesman said 
to achieve democracy in nicaragua and security for all of 
central america clearly requires a viable and effective nicaraguan 
democratic resistance he said 
when the congress returns the president hopes they will move 
swifly to enact legislation currently being formulated in the 
senate for further aid to the resistance fitzwater said 
the house voted 38518 on thursday to condemn nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government for brutal suppression of basic 
human rights it urged the democracies of central america to meet 
to assess the situation 
the house action followed closely on the 914 roll call by which 
the senate on wednesday night adopted a stronger resolution warning 
that military aid to the contras could be approved if the 
sandinista government continues to frustrate democratic reforms and 
does not end human rights abuses 
both resolutions condemn the sandinistas for breaking up a 
recent peaceful demonstration jailing more than 40 people 
including opposition leaders closing down the newspaper la prensa 
and the catholic radio station and expelling us ambassador 
richard melton and eight other american diplomats 
military aid was ended last february but a 471 million aid 
package containing 20 million for military purposes was introduced 
late wednesday in the senate by minority leader bob dole rkan 
the white house on thursday expressed support for the combined 
humanitarian and military aid which would last through next march 
under the measure aid to the contras would be authorized only 
after the president certifies that it is necessary and after both 
houses of congress approve it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that the 
white house was working with congress on a new contra aid bill and 
said dole has been very helpful in this effort 
when reagan was asked wednesday whether he was supporting 
efforts o get a new contra aid package through congress he 
responded you bet i am 
advocates of ending military assistance contended the step would 
encourage the sandinistas and contras to negotiate seriously and to 
cooperate in the central american peace process fostered by costa 
rican president oscar arias 
american humanitarian assistance to the contra forces has 
continued 
until the sandinista crackdown last weekend there had appeared 
to be virtually no prospect that military aid to the contras would 
be restored 
the house appeared divided on the issue on thursday 
i expect this body to take stronger action later said rep 
robert j lagomarsino rcalif echoing many of his colleagues 
this resolution contains strong words but it is just that 
strong words he said there are no teeth in this resolution 
but rep david bonior dmich also speaking for many of his 
colleagues said the united states should do nothing to fuel 
further fighting in central america 
bonior said that while it is important to condemn any 
violations of the principle of democracy he believes there is 
still life in the peace process 
the basis for progress i believe still remains he said 
in senate testimony ambassador melton said he believes 
congressional resolutions do little to sway the sandinistas 
melton said he does think the sandinistas are impressed with 
any evidence of resoluteness on the part of the congress and 
evidence of bipartisan resolve 
but he added i think the sandinistas are impressed more by 
actions than by words

sixtyfour house democrats are asking gov 
michael dukakis to commit himself to a strong united states space 
program to encourage young people to pursue science and engineering 
careers 
the present administration has allowed our space program to 
lose direction and founder said a letter handed to dukakis on 
wednesday by rep mary rose oakar dohio whose district includes 
nasas lewis research center

for their signature 
we as democrats believe that our party must pick up the fallen 
torch of space exploration and carry it high it said the next 
president will have the choice of leading america to a permanent 
presence in space or allowing other more ambitious countries to 
surge ahead 
the letter said that a successful space program needs a 
welleducated workforce but that young americans arent pursuing 
the necessary studies 
more than half of all graduate degrees earned in science and 
engineering at american institutions go to foreign nationals it 
added a strong civilian space program provides incentives for 
young people to pursue a career in science and or engineering and 
is necessary to ensuring a sturdy american technology base

career i had already experienced 
dickson 54 who joined the force in 1960 became eligible for 
retirement this year and said he simply decided to take it he said

in a turnabout of fortune at christies art 
auction house friday a littleknown work brought 16 times the 
artists record price but one by the illustrious jmw turner did 
not meet its minimum and was withdrawn 
the turner a dreamy landscape in oil called cicero at the 
villa was among the last works by the english artist who lived 
from 17751851 
it had been expected to break the record for the artist of 737 
million pounds 123 million but the highest offer of 62 million 
pounds 103 million was short of the minimum fixed by the 
owner evelyn de rothschild 
two leopards playing by the 19thcentury swiss artist 
jacqueslaurent agasse on the other hand sold for 385 million 
pounds 644 million 
agasses previous record was 385000 he produced the oil 
which went to a telephone bidder in 1808 for an english patron 
the markets always full of surprises and sometimes it goes 
both ways said william hanham a spokesman for christies 
were pleased that the agasse has done so well and obviously 
disappointed about the turner 
one reason for high expectations about the 1839 turner work was 
that most of his paintings are in museums 
anne montefiore of the auction house said christies expects the 
painting to be sold later through a private offer from a buyer 
whose name was not revealed 
the previous record for an agasse was set in june 1987 with the 
sale in new york of lord rivers coursing on newmarket heath 
ms montefiore said interest in two leopards playing was high 
because the artists works are very rare

while the united states bakes under 
recordbreaking heat waves england has been sloshing through 
another cool wet summer 
the sogginess which optimists call unseasonal has slightly 
dampened the tourist trade but for some parched visitors from the 
united states its becoming an attraction 
according to the london weather center southeast england was 
drenched with 1 times the average amount of rain during the first 
two weeks of july temperatures have been several degrees below 
normal the center says and there has been only 80 percent of the 
normal amount of sunshine 
its pretty bad said a spokesman at the weather office who 
requested anonymity in keeping with civil service rules weve 
had three fairly poor summers in a row if we keep on going itll 
be a fourth 
that prospect worries some in the tourism business 
at the london zoo spokeswoman sue copsey said attendance is 
slightly down because of the weather were obviously hoping 
that august will be nice she said 
the sentiment is shared at guided tours of london which 
conducts walking tours of the british capital an employee there 
said because of the weather were finding that people are not 
turning up 
but overall british tourism officials say the gray skies and 
tepid temperatures havent kept foreign visitors away 
as far as overseas visitors the weather doesnt affect 
numbers said bob barton an official with the british tourist 
authority most people coming to britain expect to get bad 
weather 
but bad is in the eye of the beholder 
american tourists questioned at random said they found the wet 
cool london weather a welcome change from the searing heat in parts 
of the united states 
i came from a 105degree heat wave and im very happy to be 
here said joyce fogg of fair lawn nj 
standing in a long line outside a tourist eatery under a sky 
threatening yet another downpour ms fogg said she was not 
disappointed with londons notoriously bad weather i was told 
that it would be rainy she said 
her 14yearold daughter susan chimed in i love it its 
great to be out of the heat and be in the coolness 
judy tichenor chaperoning a group of students from portland 
ore admitted it would be nice to have had some sunshine but she 
added it hasnt disappointed us that much we brought umbrellas 
we brought a lot of them 
to britons the occasional sunny day is becoming a novelty 
but barton the tourist authority official sees a silver lining 
in the rain clouds for people from some parts of the world he 
said our weather is a novelty part of the attraction

secretary of state george p shultz said on 
friday the united states should not try to stop the chinese from 
selling arms to middle east nations by slowing high technology 
sales to china 
shultz on his second day in beijing said there were other 
constructive ways to persuade the chinese not to sell the weapons 
he was responding to reporters questions about a published report 
that beijing had agreed to sell intermediaterange m9 missiles to 
syria an enemy of israel 
shultz said chinese leaders told him their only ballistic 
missile sales in the middle east have been to saudi arabia 
more than 100 us congressmen sent shultz a cable thursday 
warning that future transfers of us high technlogoy to china 
would be jeopardized if the sale to syria went through 
shultz said he got word of the cable only after his meetings 
with top chinese leaders he met privately with senior leader deng 
xiaoping communist party chief zhao ziyang and premier li peng 
i think the way to try to get at it with the chinese is other 
kinds of constructive ways he said 
the los angeles times reported on thursday that beijing had 
agreed to sell intermediate range m9 missiles to syria 
senior reagan administration officials traveling with shultz 
have said the chinese are believed to be marketing the weapons 
which have a maximum range of about 370 miles but there are no 
indications of a final sale 
the officials say the m9 which would be capable of striking 
targets in israel if launched from syria is at least nine months 
away from production and that a prototype is still being tested in 
china 
he said the chinese had not promised to halt ballistic missile 
sales to the middle east but the subject was still open to 
discussion we didnt come to any agreements about it but 
im sure that the subject will continue to be an important one on 
our agenda shultz told reporters 
angry over alleged chinese sales of antiship silkworm missiles 
to iran washington last fall temporarily tightened regulation of 
hightechnology sales to china 
the united states also has been critical of beijings sale this 
spring of intermediaterange css2 or east wind missiles to saudi 
arabia 
on saturday shultz flies to seoul south korea the seventh 
stop on a ninecountry trip through asia and the pacific 
discussions in beijing also focused on the khmer rouge the 
chinesebacked cambodian guerrillas who some fear may muscle their 
way back into power 
the khmer rouge massacred hundreds of thousands of fellow 
cambodians while in power during the mid1970s vietnam ousted them 
when it invaded in 1978 
shultz said the united states and china have a very broad 
agreement as to certain aspects of that situation including 
rather similar views on stopping a khmer rouge comeback china 
officially supports a threeparty cambodian opposition coalition 
that includes the khmer rouge 
although the chinese have said little publicly about the 
cambodian problem during shultzs visit the american side has 
strongly indicated that beijing is sensitive to the khmer rouge 
dilemma and willing to do something about it 
shultz said both countries are pressing for a total pullout of 
vietnamese troops and both view prince norodom sihanouk as the 
central figure in a future cambodian government sihanouk abruptly 
resigned this week as head of the antivietnamese coalition 
there have been several proposals including one from sihanouk 
for a peacekeeping force to ensure a ceasefire the peaceful 
formation of a government and free elections in cambodia 
vietnam has pledged to remove all its troops currently 
estimated at 120000 by us sources by 1990 this has led to 
fears that the khmer rouge would shoulder aside their two less 
powerful noncommunist allies in the antivietnamese coalition and 
seize power once hanois forces have left

there is one wellknown democratic 
politician of greek ancestry from massachusetts who is not seeking 
the presidency and isnt even going to the democratic convention in 
atlanta 
i have no political ambitions whatsoever says former us 
sen paul tsongas once hailed as a liberal maverick on capitol 
hill were much happier now than when i was in office 
he has scaled down his aspirations since he disclosed that he 
had cancer and left the senate one month before his 43rd birthday 
the last traces of cancer are gone but he prefers the limelight 
of this old mill town to the spotlight of washington 
though no longer a senator tsongas still makes headlines in the 
sun a 55000circulation daily that serves his hometown it has 
been reporting his doings ever since he sat on the lowell city 
council in the late 1960s and right on through his election to the 
us house in 1974 first democrat to win the district in about 90 
years and to the senate in 1979 
one recent edition landed on tsongas side porch carrying an 
article about his tangle over the ouster of the lowell school 
superintendent 
he also created a statewide stir recently when as the head of a 
study commission on the environment he called for a building 
moratorium on cape cod the matter which will be on the november 
ballot is still being hotly debated 
tsongas enjoys watching his friend gov michael dukakis reach 
for the white house in particular because the likely democratic 
presidential nominee expounds tsongas philosophy that the 
democrats survival depends on integrating the needs of business 
liberals have to be concerned with economics democrats have 
to be the friends of business the major issue facing the 
country is the sense of decline that were going to be some 
latterday great britain he said 
although he once floated the idea of running for president its 
enough for tsongas to stump for his friend to know he isnt missing 
a thing 
in some ways he prefers wielding influence as an exsenator 
im really struck by how much respect there is for the office 
of senator he said it is very special and you can use 
that how many 47yearold former senators do you know 
certainly in peoples dealings with me they are much more 
accepting of me now than when i was in office i have no political 
ambitions so im less tainted also theres the illness issue 
in september 1983 he was diagnosed as having nonhodgkins 
lymphoma a relatively mild cancer of the lymph nodes that attacks 
part of the immune system nearly four months later in the middle 
of his second run for the senate tsongas decided it would be 
better for everyone if he took his wife nikki and their three 
daughters home to lowell 
since then he has undergone a bone marrow transplant and has 
been declared cancerfree 
tsongas works for a prestigious boston law firm foley hoag amp 
eliot making deals and serving on corporate boards and taking pro 
bono assignments 
his latest battle over his proposal that construction on the 
cape be halted until the peninsula gets control of development has 
led to abuse from builders and developers while filling his mailbox 
with letters from cape codders telling him to stick with it 
i know im doing well because my political enemies are angry 
at me he said with glee recalling the wrath of a roomful of 
developers at a public hearing on the issue six hundred people 
were shouting at me 
he shrugged i have nothing to fear politically and with 
what ive been through 
the day i turn around and theres nobody behind me is the day 
i get out of it the mail i get is so passionate you cannot read 
that mail and say im going to walk away

police are interviewing witnesses sgt jerold seidl said 
there appears to be a pattern it sounds like someone is getting 
full on steak 
sixty 14ounce top sirloin steaks were taken after 1130 pm 
wednesday when someone broke in through the front window of the 
restaurant 
the alarm went off when he broke the window but he went 
straight to the icebox and got out before police got here hamby 
said hes pretty brave to do that on sixth street on a busy 
night 
hamby said 50 to more than 100 steaks have been taken each time 
the restaurant has been hit and the thief also has broken in 
through the ceiling and the kitchen window 
i had to put burglar bars on the side windows and would rather 
not do that to the front but i may have to because its running up 
there hamby said 
he estimated his losses at 5000 to 7000 including repairs 
on broken windows

generation through a wider acceptance of healthier lifestyles and 
the development of drugs now in the laboratory 
goldstein said he expects that people who are genetically 
susceptible to heart disease eventually will be identified through 
blood tests and that the number of people killed by heart attack 
will be reduced dramatically 
we may control heart disease before we thoroughly understand 
it said goldstein he said he and other scientists now are 
tracking down the precise genetic factors that lead to the 
development of atherosclerosis the major form of heart disease 
goldstein said this could lead to a blood test that would enable 
doctors to identify patients most at risk for heart attack long 
before any heart disease has developed

he marched with king won election as georgias 
first black congressman since reconstruction and later championed 
human rights as us ambassador to the united nations 
now andrew young is atlantas mayor and chief booster using the 
democratic national convention as a hometown showcase for the sales 
pitch he makes around the world 
with 13000 reporters in town or on the way young is scheduling 
daily news conferences in contrast to his usual practice of 
scheduling none 
as a prominent black democratic officeholder he came under 
early pressure to endorse jesse jackson but he steered clear 
saying that as host mayor for the convention he shouldnt be taking 
such stands 
id like to see atlanta have a worldwide reputation as a 
market center young said in a recent interview weve been 
trying to find ways to create jobs and to wipe out some of the 
problems of poverty in our city by actually attracting and 
generating new wealth 
youngs emphasis on improving atlanta with private investment 
has won enough support from white business leaders to have him 
thinking aloud about a run for governor next year on a platform of 
economic development 
but the mayor also bears some bruises from charges he has 
forgotten the poor while courting the rich 
i think he has been good for atlanta as a whole bringing in 
business but i dont think the lowincome community looks at him 
as being good for them said louise watley president of the 
tenants association in the carver homes housing project 
young said he was wounded when ms watley invited him and the 
news media to a tenants meeting and then issued a scathing 
indictment of him starting 90 minutes of accusations by 
project residents that he had failed them 
it really hurt because these are people who have always been 
my close friends and supporters he said he also said his 
administration has brought jobs to the area around carver homes and 
money for improvements in the project itself 
young said the incident has changed his outlook on handling such 
functions im not a sucker and im not going to make myself 
available to get set up any more but not his emotions about 
dealing with criticism from the poor 
i grew up middle class so from early childhood i had to deal 
with the question of middle class guilt and i found it not very 
productive so you have to maintain your sense of responsibility 
your sense of vision and hope but not pay much attention to your 
critics said the 56yearold mayor 
young trained as a minister was a top aide to martin luther 
king jr during the civil rights movement of the 1960s after 
kings death he won a congressional seat in an atlanta district 
then came his tenure as jimmy carters un ambassador giving him 
an international reputation 
since his election as mayor in 1981 he has circled the globe in 
search of new business for atlanta 
he displays a handsoff approach to the daytoday running of 
the city 
basically my style is to get intelligent and dedicated people 
get them committed to a vision and in a certain direction and then 
give them all the support i can he said 
young himself has plenty of supporters 
we were losing a lot of investment to the suburbs and weve 
seen a lot of investment come back into the city during youngs 
administration said dan sweat who recently concluded 15 years as 
president of central atlanta progress a downtown business group 
the atlanta skyline bristles with new development and the mayor 
can rattle off projects worth several billion dollars still on the 
drawing boards 
its beyond the comprehension of most of us said charles 
loudermilk a businessman and lifelong atlantan who usually votes 
republican but was an early supporter of young 
andy young has to get a tremendous amount of the credit 
because all of us feel good about ourselves our businesses and our 
city and frankly that was not true when andy came in said 
loudermilk 
he has an ability to open any door in the world he said 
i was with him in france and we met with president francois 
mitterand the mayor and all of the ministers and bankers and 
young is an absolute absolute world hero

a marine with one lung today neared the 
final leg of a 146mile run from scorching death valley the lowest 
point in the contiguous 48 states to the summit of mount whitney 
the highest point 
maj john bates 42 began his grueling trek at 8 pm 
wednesday he was expected to reach the end of the paved road and 
the start of the trail to 14464foot mount whitney before noon 
forest ranger clark trowell said 
bates faced a 103mile hike up a wellworn but extremely steep 
path to the summit the steepest part of the trail is between 
12000 and 13700 feet where even the most experienced hiker 
struggles with the thin air 
the marine ate salty foods drank large quantities of water and 
took caffeine pills to stay awake but was suffering from cramps and 
nausea bates who lost a lung to a bullet in vietnam in 1966 said 
the run was for fun and to inspire other disabled veterans 
he planned to run nonstop going from 282 feet below sea level 
to mount whitneys summit in hopes of shaving five hours off the 
record of 45 hours 15 minutes 
he appeared likely to break his personal best time 63 hours 12 
minutes in 1986 he took two eighthour sleep breaks during that 
run 
as his figure blurred by heat waves bobbed down the road 
thursday his wife stephanie followed in an airconditioned 
mobile home 
i have been thinking about just yanking him into the car and 
driving home she said she begged her husband to eat more tuna 
sandwiches theyre a miracle cure lots of salt 
his run came during the hottest season for death valley with 
the daytime air temperature often reaching 120 degrees and the sand 
200 degrees said death valley acting chief ranger russell march

what a difference 16 years can make jesse 
jackson the solo remaining alsoran in the field of candidates for 
the democratic presidential nomination had to wage a bitter fight 
just to win a seat on the democratic convention floor in miami in 
1972 
nancy jefferson remembers one of jacksons allies at that time 
just as she is one of his delegates this time she was so 
pleased with the rebels victory at that steamy convention that she 
took a plunge into a swimming pool with her clothes on 
it was that kind of excitement she says it was a great 
day 
the challenging bloc of four dozen renegade delegates faced 
contempt of court and jail for pursuing their fight 
even after they won it took a 90 decision by the us supreme 
court to nail down the victory and the event may have played a 
role in the demise of the political operation led by thenchicago 
mayor richard j daley one of the most powerful big city political 
machines in the country 
mrs jefferson 64 chief executive officer of the midwest 
community council a west side group in chicago is headed to the 
convention in atlanta with at least four other illinois delegates 
who were with jackson and thenalderman william singer in the rebel 
group in miami 
heres how it happened 
a week before the 1972 convention the partys credentials 
committee which leaned toward george mcgovern granted the 
singerjackson delegates convention seats on a 7161 vote that 
decision was challenged on the first day of the convention a 
session which lasted well into the next morning 
the challenge failed in a floor vote the memory still rankles 
thomas lyons one of the ousted daley delegates 
it was one of the most monstrous things ive ever seen said 
lyons 57 a former state senator he said he and other delegates 
received thousands of votes and we were replaced by people 
who met in somebodys living room it was a theft 
mcgovern the democratic presidential nominee in 1972 had 
helped set the stage for the spectacle of keeping daley from the 
convention floor 
after the tumultuous 1968 democratic national convention in 
chicago where antiwar demonstrators rocked the city and clashed 
with daleys city police force mcgovern chaired a commission that 
rewrote party rules to make room for more minorities women and 
young people 
the cook county democratic committee under daleys 
leadership flagrantly violated every aspect of the rules said 
saul mendelson of chicago a jackson delegate this year who was an 
alternate with the 1972 rebels 
the renegades held their own caucuses so they could offer an 
alternative 
the antimachine democrats in the city knew that a simple 
protest would result in either a meaningless rebuke to the daley 
forces on the convention floor or expulsion of the 59 daley 
people leaving no representation for chicago 
lyons saw the quickly called meetings as a political charade 
singer agrees that his delegates chosen in church basements and 
living rooms were not picked in orthodox ways but i dont think 
there was anyone in chicago who didnt know what was going on he 
said 
after the credentials committee action daley forces went to 
court and cook county circuit judge daniel a covelli prohibited 
the singerjackson delegates from taking their convention seats he 
threatened to jail leaders of the group if they disobeyed 
still the rebels went to the convention and faced a challenge 
on the floor 
that vote shaped up as the most dramatic moment of the 1972 
convention according to clout mayor daley and his city a 
1975 book by chicago reporter and commentator len oconnor the 
power of the old guard was under challenge 
mendelson said daley who was keeping in touch with the 
delegation from his vacation home in michigan would not agree to 
offers to split the delegate seats or take over leadership of the 
renegades himself 
when the floor vote was taken the singerjackson group kept 
their seats 
critics said the chicago rift would hurt mcgoverns chances 
maybe they did but he lost 49 states including illinois to gop 
incumbent richard nixon 
covellis contemptofcourt order was stayed pending an appeal 
the illinois supreme court later refused to hear the case but the 
us supreme court ruled 90 for the singerjackson group the high 
court said that a political party has the right to make and enforce 
its own rules that ended the threat of jail 
singer isnt convinced that the 1972 events led to the downfall 
of daleys machine but mrs jefferson thinks it was one step on 
the path of opening political power in the windy city to those who 
had been shut out 
i think it sort of changed the whole politics of 
chicago she said

a federal judge today refused to provide 
a sealed government affidavit to attorneys for defense consultant 
melvyn paisley a key figure in the massive defense procurement 
investigation 
meanwhile a federal magistrate in los angeles ordered the 
government to unseal four other search warrant affidavits however 
he delayed the unsealing until 5 pm edt and the government said 
it would appeal the decision 
us district court judge james c cacheris overruled a 
magistrate who last week told paisleys attorneys they could see 
the 61page affidavit so long as they showed it to no one else 
including paisley 
the court finds the magistrates ruling is clearly 
erroneous cacheris said 
he agreed with us attorney henry hudsons arguments that the 
governments case could be hurt by premature disclosure of the 
affidavit which outlines the governments case and provides a 
wealth of detail about why investigators are looking into 
activities of paisley and his wife vicki 
the affidavit was used by fbi agents to conduct searches of 
paisleys house and office 
the governments sensitive investigation involves national 
security issues as well as pentagon officials cacheris said 
e lawrence barcella jr paisleys attorney said he was 
disappointed with the ruling and was considering whether he should 
appeal cacheris decision to the 4th circuit court of appeals 
hudson argued that the paisleys and their lawyers only wanted 
the affidavit to satisfy idle curiosity but he said the papers 
should remain sealed so the government can complete its probe 
he promised cacheris that the affidavit would be released to the 
public within about a month 
paisley a former assistant secretary of the navy is one of 40 
people and companies that have been identified as targets of the 
massive investigation of the pentagons 150billionayear 
procurement process 
in los angeles the search warrants ordered unsealed by us 
magistrate joseph reichmann were executed on june 13 and permitted 
government to search the offices of northrop corp teledyne 
industries litton industries and the home of defense consultant 
fred lackner 
we are talking about the foundations of our country the 
defense of our country reichmann said in ruling on motions by 
the los angeles times copley newspapers and the national 
broadcasting corp 
ive come to the conclusion there is this right of access to 
obtain things lodged with the court prior to the return of an 
indictment he said 
the investigation centers around allegations that defense 
consultants paid bribes to pentagon officials to obtain information 
that would help contractors secure government projects 
no charges have been filed in the investigation but grand jury 
subponeas have been issued to numerous people including paisley

irans foreign minister today accused the 
united states of making excuses but not accepting responsibility 
for its destruction of an iranian jetliner and the deaths of the 
290 people aboard 
the soviet union said the us navy should leave the persian 
gulf to avoid future tragedies like the shooting down of iran air 
flight 655 it said an international un fleet should replace the 
american warships 
as the security council resumed debate on the july 3 incident 
the soviets britain france china japan and west germany all 
called on iran to accept a yearold council resolution calling for 
a ceasefire in the nearly 8yearold iraniraq war 
irans foreign minister aliakbar velayati said at a news 
conference that the attitude of the us administration is 
similar to a rich mans son who drives when hes drunk he thinks 
money can buy everything and that is not true 
the united states offered to pay compensation to the families of 
the victims but said it did so out of humanitarian concerns and not 
because it is legally obligated 
velayai said the us offer would be acceptable only within 
the context of the united states accepting responsibility for 
shooting down the iranian airliner 
us officials say navy forces shot down the airliner because 
they thought it was an iranian f14 jet fighter 
during debate the soviet representative valentin v lozinskiy 
said the tragedy has demonstrated once again that the united 
states fleet must leave the waters of the persian gulf right away 
how can one regard as selfdefense the destruction of a 
passenger airliner flying within an established air corridor many 
thousands of kilometers from the borders of the power that is 
allegedly defending itself he asked 
british un official john birch expressed his countrys 
profound regret over the loss of life but said the underlying 
cause of the disaster and of all warrelated casualties in the 
persian gulf is irans refusal to accept the ceasefire resolution 
iran never decisively rejected the resolution but has insisted 
that iraq be branded the aggressor in the war as the first step 
toward peace 
frances representative pierre brochand said the 
international community cannot pass judgment on such a tragic error 
without the results of an inquiry by the international civil 
aviation organization in montreal the icaos governing council 
agreed thursday that such an inquiry should be conducted 
we should of course take into account the conditions 
prevailing in the region a region for years fraught with 
insecurity because of the iraniraq war brochand said in 
calling on iran to honor the ceasefire resolution 
the debate adjourned until monday 
iran requested the council meeting to seek condemnation of the 
uss vincennes downing of the airbus a300 over the strait of hormuz 
and to demand withdrawal of all american forces from the gulf it 
has not been able to muster the votes for a condemnation 
on thursday vice president george bush called the incident a 
terrible human tragedy but said iran shares responsibility he 
said the united states has a legal right to protect middle east 
shipping lanes 
un spokesman francois giuliani said iran and the 15 members of 
the security council agreed that council president paulo 
nogueirabatista of brazil would draft a document in consultation 
with iran and the members which include the united states 
giuliani said it was not known whether the document would be a 
resolution which requires a vote or a statement from the council 
president adopted by consensus which carries far less weight 
the move was considered a confirmation that iran had failed to 
persuade a majority of the security council members to pass a 
resolution denouncing the united states 
the vincennes and the uss elmer montgomery had skirmished with 
iranian attack boats just before the jetliner entered the area 
the united states says the airliner did not respond to repeated 
questioning by the vincennes about its identity and the cruisers 
captain believed it was an f14 transmitting ambiguous signals and 
descending in attack pattern 
after seven unanswered warnings bush said the captain 
did what he had to do to protect his ship and the lives of his 
crew 
velayati read what he said was a transcript of a communication 
between iran air flight 655 flying from a militarycivilian 
airport at bandar abbas iran across the strait of hormuz to dubai 
in the united arab emirates and the bandar abbas control tower 
just before the attack 
the transcript contained no warnings from the vincennes or 
communications with it 
the shooting down of an iranian civil airliner flying on a 
scheduled flight known to the us warships and using an 
internationally established and published civilian airway and 
transmitting signals identifying itself as a civilian airliner 
could not have been a mistake he said 
bush said i will not dignify with a response the charge that 
we deliberately destroyed iran air 655

a federal magistrate ordered the government 
today to unseal documents outlining the basis for the california 
portion of its probe of fraud in the defense industry the 
government immediately appealed 
the public has a right to know about matters of such interest 
and importance us magistrate joseph reichmann said in ruling on 
requests by the los angeles times the copley newspapers chain and 
nbc 
we are talking about the foundations of our country the 
defense of our country reichmann said 
the documents in question are affidavits filed in support of 
search warrants in the court papers investigators set out the 
wrong they believe has been done and what they seek in their 
searches 
the warrants were used june 13 to search the offices of northrop 
corp teledyne industries litton industries and the home of 
defense consultant fred lackner they were among 33 search warrants 
executed across the country that day 
at the request of us attorney robert bonner reichmann delayed 
the unsealing until 2 pm the government then said it was 
appealing the ruling to us district judge david kenyon who 
scheduled a hearing for 2 pm 
bonner had argued that disclosure of the affidavits would alert 
targets of the investigation and might encourage them to destroy 
documents he also contended that the first amendment right of 
access applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted 
the investigation which became public last month centers on 
allegations that defense industry consultants bribed pentagon 
officials for inside information useful in winning win 
multimilliondollar contracts 
if reichmanns order stands los angeles would be the third 
city after st louis and dallas in which sealed documents 
detailing aspects of the probe were made public 
in alexandria va today a us district judge rejected a 
similar unsealing request by attorneys for consultant melvyn 
paisley a former assistant navy secretary who is a key figure in 
the probe paisleys home and office were searched 
reichmann adopted the position argued by attorney rex heincke 
representing the times who said the outpouring of publicity on the 
defense fraud probe in the last month makes the sealing unwarranted 
its important that these people that want to know this small 
band of people that read the papers can feel they have some say to 
check up on what people in all three parcels of our government are 
doing reichmann said 
the magistrate said citizens are entitled to ask are we just 
throwing our money away when we buy these defense programs 
corruption bribery these are things that go to the heart of 
how our government functions he said 
reichmann disclosed that one of the affidavits has been 
misplaced by the court clerks office for no sinister reason 
and may not be available 
lackners attorney william dougherty had also urged at the 
hearing today that the affidavits be unsealed to allow him to 
properly defend his client who he said has been effectively put 
out of business by the seizure of all his business records

speedboats attacked a tanker that passed 
within five miles of the irans farsi island military stronghold 
friday but the ship escaped with minor damage as an american 
missile frigate raced to its aid 
no assistance was required when the robert g bradley 
reached the 85989ton sea victory in international waters a us 
navy spokesman said 
she went within five miles of farsi and they came out to get 
her he said she turned tail and ran straight out they went 
back home and left her alone 
us officials said the warship could not have defended the 
tanker close to the island because navy rules of engagement 
allow intervention only in international waters and the united 
states recognizes a 12mile limit around farsi 
shipping executives said iran is preparing a new oil platform in 
the southern persian gulf equipped with facilities that suggest 
military purposes possibly defensive as well as civilian 
a radio report from the liberianregistered tankers greek 
captain said the speedboats attacked three times making lots of 
holes starting a small fire and slightly wounding the first mate 
it was the second attack in three days near farsi in the 
northern persian gulf iranian revolutionary guards use the island 
60 miles off saudi arabia as a base for attacks on neutral 
commercial shipping from speedboats armed with machine guns and 
grenade launchers 
attacks in the area have increased recently after months of 
comparative calm gulf shipping executives said the iranian raids 
apparently were reprisals for two iraqi air raids on iranian 
tankers last week 
iraq raids tankers owned or chartered by iran in an attempt to 
stop the oil exports with which its enemy finances the 8yearold 
war and iran responds with attacks on ships trading with gulf arab 
states more than 500 ships have been attacked by both sides 
us helicopters and iranian speedboats exchanged fire tuesday 
after the boats attacked a panamanianregistered tanker west of 
farsi us pilots said one boat may have been damaged 
on friday the sea victory was bound for kuwait when speedboats 
attacked at about 2 pm and the captain issued a distress call 
the bradley on patrol 25 miles away replied and sped toward 
the reported location when the two vessels met less than an hour 
later the fire was out and the sea victory was in no danger the 
navy spokesman said 
there was no involvement of us forces with the gunboats and 
no us helicopters entered territorial waters we do not violate 
territorial waters of any country he said 
although military officials said the distress message was a 
general mayday call shipping executives quoted radio monitors 
as saying the tanker asked american warships for help the 
informants said later the captain shouted we want the navy we 
want the helicopters to chase them away 
under the broader rules of engagement that took effect two 
months ago us warships may intervene in attacks on ships of 
nonus registry if they request help are not connected wth 
either of the belligerents and are in international waters 
before that the navy could offer armed protection only to 
usflag ships 
shipping executives who mentioned the new iranian oil platform 
said any military role might be strictly defensive 
the platform under construction in a port on the arab side of 
the gulf will have electronic gear radar and landing pads to 
handle three helicopters at once and steel plating apparently to 
protect it from attack the executives said 
they quoted iranian officials as saying it would be an 
administrative base for irans fleet of shuttle tankers delivering 
oil to the larak island export terminal in the strait of hormuz 
the informants spoke on condition of anonymity 
iran has used oil platforms as military communications bases and 
us forces demolished three one last october and two on april 18 
in retaliation for attacks on ships and helicopters 
abc television said equipment being installed on this platform 
could make it an offshore base capable of coordinating sea and 
airborne attacks upon the us navy 
some shipping executives agreed it could monitor traffic and be 
a base for speedboat or helicopter raids but were skeptical that 
its main purpose was military 
the term armorplated is exaggerated one said they are 
reinforcing it with steel but they are not turning it into a 
tank 
he said it probably would have antiaircraft guns to help 
protect larak from iraqi air raids

on the eve of the democratic national 
convention republican george bush and his chief political mentor 
treasury secretary james a baker iii are going fishing 
whether the two plan to spend 4 days in the wilds of wyoming 
also casting for a prospective gop running mate bush aides arent 
saying but the aides suggest draw your own conclusions on what 
the talk may turn to when the fish arent biting 
the vice president and baker leave for wyoming on saturday and 
will remain there until wednesday morning then bush plans to hit 
the campaign trail hard with events scheduled during the final two 
days of the democratic convention a break with tradition and on 
through the next weekend 
sources said the two will be fly fishing in the shoshone 
national forest in northest wyoming which covers a lot of 
territory 
campaign spokeswoman sheila tate says she has no idea where bush 
and baker will be the closest town she said is cody 
youre looking at someone with zero knowledge said ms 
tate who says she think shes being kept purposely in the dark on 
bushs whereabouts its the last chance hell have in many years 
to have a few days of normal vacation he deserves it she said 
normal vacation it isnt 
besides having with him the man soon expected to become his 
campaign chairman bush will be taking along a small secret service 
contingent and communications officers to keep him in touch with 
the white house 
and because its deemed an official vacation rather than a 
campaign trip taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the flight 
out on air force two 
bush aides also say therell be a forest ranger along as a guide 
hes the vice president of the united states and he will be in 
touch if he needs to be said vice presidential aide stephen 
hart hes not going to drop off the face of the earth 
bush and baker are not taking their wives on the vacation 
barbara bush will spend most of the time at the bushs seacoast 
retreat in kennebunkport maine 
happy campers are all boys ms tate said 
it will be a change of pace for bush who does most of his 
fishing in the atlantic ocean in his 27foot powerboat off 
kennebunkport he is in a great mood at the prospect of 
reaquainting himself with fly fishing techniques ms tate said 
baker is a longtime friend and political adviser to bush he ran 
bushs 1980 presidential campaign and was senior counsel to the 
1984 reaganbush reelection campaign 
bush campaign sources say they expect baker to resign as 
treasury secretary to join the bush campaign as its senior 
official most likely in early august just before the republican 
convention 
although the two administration officials themselves have been 
tightlipped on specific plans bush makes it no secret that he 
already relies on baker unofficially for campaign advice baker 
does not dispute this i return my telephone calls baker said 
in a recent interview 
there had been speculation that bush and baker would be staying 
at a cabin near cody wyo on the south fork of the shoshone river 
owned by sen alan simpson rwyo a close friend of bushs and 
among those mentioned as a possible running mate 
however simpson spokeswoman mary kay hill said friday that the 
vice president would not be staying there and that simpson had no 
plans to join the fishing trip 
bush will reappear on wednesday the nexttolast night of the 
democratic convention with two campaign apperances planned in the 
the detroit area and on thursday the day when dukakis will 
deliver his acceptance speech bush dips into the south with 
campaign events planned in charlotte nc and greenville sc 
that will break a longstanding tradition in which presidential 
contenders have ceased political activity during the rival partys 
nominating convention 
bush plans to campaign in wisconsin and new jersey the following 
day and in tennessee and florida july 23 he will address a 
business and professional womens convention in albuquerque nm

products using superconductivity may appear on 
the market within three years but it will take a decade or more 
for major applications of the technology a prominent researcher 
said friday 
paul c w chu of the university of houston commented in an 
interview after president reagan awarded him and 19 other 
researchers the national medal of science reagan also awarded the 
national medal of technology to 10 prominent leaders in the 
technical industries 
chu cited in the award description for a series of discoveries 
that helped raise the temperature of superconductive materials 
said the new technology probably will be on the market in the form 
of special batteries and smoke detectors within two to three years 
microelectronics electrical switches and other thin film 
electrical connectors will probably benefit from superconductivity 
within five years chu said 
but any large scale application is at least 10 years away 
he said he predicted that by the end of the century 
superconductivity technology will be applied to the transmission of 
electricty and in large magnets 
superconductivity is a material state that permits electricity 
to flow without resistance for decades this was thought to occur 
only in metals chilled to temperatures approaching absolute zero 
minus 4596 degrees fahrenheit 
but chu and other researchers experimenting with ceramic 
compounds have discovered how to raise the minimum 
superconductivity temperature to about inus 243 degrees a 
temperature easily maintained with relatively inexpensive liquid 
nitrogen 
experts believe the technology will permit the manufacture of 
large powerful magnets that could be used in transportation and 
medicine the technology also could substantially reduce the cost 
of electricity since about half of generated power is lost to 
transmission resistance also superconductivity could speed up 
computers and permit the more efficient storage of electricity 
chu said many nations now are racing to develop 
superconductivity technology and it is not clear who has the lead 
he said he could not predict which nation would make the first 
practical application of the new technology but i am very 
impressed by the japanese effort 
reagan in presenting the medals said it is vital that the 
united states continue to promote research into emerging 
technologies that will have a major influence on life in the future 
the president praised the medal winners as the men and women 
who are leading us into the new age of technology and that one of 
the most important jobs of government is knocking down the 
barriers of progress 
americas greatest resource is not the land he said no 
americas greatest resource is the genius of our people 
reagan gave 20 researchers the national medal of science an 
honor established by congress in 1959 to recognize achievements in 
physical biological mathematical behavioral social or 
engineering sciences 
in addition to chu those receiving the science medal were 
joseph l goldstein and michael s brown of the university of texas

afghan rebels fired more than 20 rockets into 
residential areas of kabul on friday killing 20 people wounding 
34 and damaging a mosque and other buildings in the afghanistan 
capital the tass news agency reported 
the 530 am attack which tass denounced as barbarous and 
a crime was the latest reported on a major population center 
in afghanistan fighting has spread throughout the rugged and 
mountainous country as the soviets withdraw their troops 
radio kabul also reported the attack on residential areas of the 
afghan capital the dispatch was monitored in islamabad pakistan 
however afghan guerrilla leader abdul haq told the associated 
press in islamabad the insurgents do not target residential 
neighborhoods he said the 15 to 20 rebel targets in kabul which 
include the airport and soviet embassy are not residential areas 
haq claimed afghan government troops and their soviet backers 
fire rockets into kabuls residential districts to discredit the 
guerrillas and undermine their burgeoning popular support 
we fire five rockets and suddenly we see 20 hit haq said 
disavowing responsibility for all bombardments in kabul 
tass said it was monstrous to suggest soviet forces would 
fire on a city they still occupied and said one of the 21 rockets 
launched on four kabul neighborhoods friday exploded next to the 
soviet embassy a label on one undetonated missile showed it came 
from egypt tass said 
afghan president najib speaking to members of the armed forces 
said wednesday the insurgents have become bolder as soviet troops 
depart under an accord signed april 14 in geneva the kremlin 
committed itself to begin withdrawing its more than 100000 troops 
on may 15 and to complete the pullout by feb 15 half of the 
soviet soldiers are to be home by august 
more than 35000 soviet internationalists have returned to 
their country najib said in a speech broadcast by official kabul 
radio and monitored by the british broadcasting corp 
however najib said armed interference in the internal 
affairs of our country is not only continuing but has 
intensified the extremists engage in savage crimes against 
peaceful people 
tass said villages in the provinces of paktia paktika and kunar 
were heavily bombarded by the insurgents thursday and that at least 
five people including three children were killed 
radio kabul said a land mine planted by guerrillas exploded 
thursday in a crowded bazaar in rodat 30 miles from the border 
with pakistan two people were killed and one injured 
more than 150 civilians were reported killed last weekend when 
the antimarxist rebels aided by the united states used artillery 
and rockets to shell populated areas in more than eight provinces 
on july 8 a car packed with explosives blew up near a downtown 
movie theater in the eastern city of jalalabad killing 31 people 
and injuring 33 others soviet and afghan media said 
the soviet withdrawal places the burden of warfare on the afghan 
army a force many western observers believe will be unable to 
withstand the guerrillas tass however said afghan troops had 
staged several successful operations against the rebels 
recently 
it said the army wiped out an insurgent detachment of more than 
20 fighters and captured three people who planned to commit 
terrorist acts near the southern city of kandahar 
afghanistans official bakhtar news agency reported that about 
100 antigovernment guerrillas were killed in the past week and 
that large quantities of weapons were seized including rocket 
launchers mortars machine guns grenade launchers and three 
usmade stinger missiles tass said 
soviet and afghan officials maintain they are abiding by the 
unbrokered accords on afghanistan they have used increasingly 
tough language in accusing pakistan which is also a signatory of 
blatant violations 
in particular the soviets say pakistan is allowing its 
territory to be used to supply the rebels with weapons and 
ammunition and as the home of a rival afghan government staterun 
radio moscow accused pakistan on friday of crude violations of 
the geneva accords 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfilyev told 
a government news briefing thursday the kremlin may reconsider its 
obligations under the agreements if the violations by pakistan 
continue 
however he shied away from mentioning any potential soviet 
reaction 
the commander of soviet forces in afghanistan lt gen boris 
gromov said in a newspaper interview published sunday that the 
violations could force his country to reconsider the withdrawal 
timetable 
the kremlin sent tanks and troops into afghanistan in december 
1979 to preside over the replacement of one marxist leader by 
another the soviets stayed on to fight the guerrillas in a brutal 
war in which more than 13000 red army soldiers lost their lives

looking back on nearly eight years as president 
ronald reagan said with a short dry laugh that his greatest 
achievement may have been staying alive 
the 77yearold us chief executive who was shot in the chest 
in 1981 commented in the second of a threepart series on his 
presidency broadcast friday on british televisions independent 
channel 4 
david gergen former white house spokesman said the public 
attitude toward reagan changed after the assassination attempt 
you may not agree with him you may think hes too simple 
not a man of the world but there is a sense of conviction about 
him gergen said a strength of character emerges in the 
shooting which transforms his presence 
the 50minute program called walking tall covers reagans 
first term 
it starts with former aide michael deaver recalling that he 
found his boss sleeping under a mound of bedcovers on the morning 
of his inauguration jan 20 1981 
i said governor there was kind of a grunt deaver said 
and i said good god in an hour and a half youre going to be 
sworn in as the 40th president of the united states he rolled 
over and said do i have to 
much of the program focused on assessments by political analysts 
and former members of reagans administration 
to howard baker former white house chief of staff ronald 
reagan is the most presidential man ive ever known that will be 
his principal legacy and by that i mean he knows exactly who he 
is he is president of the united states and he has no trouble with 
that he is not offended by it upset by it or intimidated by it 
stuart spencer a longtime adviser said nobody in american 
politics has better style and form than ronald reagan 
howard philips chairman of the conservative caucus political 
group called him the most typical the most american the most 
average but in a good sense in a likeable sense president we 
could ever imagine 
the presidents policies of increasing defense spending cutting 
social programs and refusing to raise taxes came in for tough 
criticism 
reagan was asked how he responded to the fact that he never 
balanced the budget and the united states now is the worlds 
biggest debtor nation 
im just as critical of it as i was before i got here he 
replied 
donald regan former treasury secretary and chief of staff said 
the president never discussed economics or finance with him regan 
said congress made budget cuts almost impossible 
david stockman the former budget director who urged reagan to 
raise taxes had a harsh assessment 
after time when the full extent of the damage is clear and 
the heavy price we will pay for years to come is evident 
historians will record reaganomics as the singular greatest episode 
of sustained economic mismanagement in the 20th century history of 
the united states 
regan called that sour grapes on the part of david stockman 
and added he never got what he wanted which was solely to have 
taxes raised that was not an antidote to get us out of 
recession in 1982 
some of the first terms major events were shown including the 
assassination attempt the october 1983 bombing of a us marine 
barracks in beirut that killed 243 military personnel and the 
invasion of grenada two days later 
recalling the assassination attempt reagan said i heard what 
i thought was firecrackers i didnt feel a bullet hit me 
when asked what was his greatest achievement he said 
sometimes i think then laughed and continued just staying 
alive 
even reagans critics praised his ability to control the media 
these people have understood that they have a powerful 
instrument of news management in their hand said richard 
neustadt a harvard university professor and author of 
presidential power who described reagans mastery of the photo 
opportunity and disdain of formal news conferences

the military administration said friday it 
would end the school year in the occupied west bank in a week and 
arab students complained they would lose a month of studies and 
fail their final exams 
also friday a united nations official blamed prolonged army 
curfews and palestinian commercial strikes for cash shortages in 
the occupied gaza strip 
the official who requested anonymity also reported problems in 
the delivery of food supplies to gazas refugee camps but he said 
no one was going hungry in the strip where 650000 palestinians 
live 
in another development an 18yearold arab was wounded in the 
leg during a clash with soldiers in gazas bureij camp a local 
reporter said the army said it was not aware of the incident 
a spokesman for the israeli military administration in the west 
bank said the school year would end on july 21 with final exams 
likely to begin saturday 
palestinian students said the step would chop a month off the 
school year and give them no time to study for their exams they 
said the school year had been scheduled to end in midaugust 
but the military spokesman olivier rafovitz said the dates in 
august had only been tentative he said the measure was not 
political but a purely technical decision 
at the height of the arab uprising in february the army closed 
800 west bank schools claiming they were major centers of 
palestinian unrest the schools were reopened in a threestage 
procedure ending june 6 
since the reopening the military administration ordered several 
dozen schools closed until the end of the school year it also kept 
280000 palestinian students in the west bank out of school for a 
week after student riots 
arab students said the new measure meant they would fail their 
exams 
there is no time to study if we go for exams nobody would 
pass said issam ismaeel 18 of bethlehem high school they 
are trying to pressure us and its clear they are after our 
failure 
a curfew on nablus the largest west bank city with 120000 arab 
residents entered its fourth day friday 
curfews also continued in the town of qalqilya the vilage of 
beit sahur and the aida refugee camp near bethlehem and two other 
west bank villages in beit sahur villagers have been confined to 
their homes for eight days 
a un relief official said prolonged curfews in gaza have 
caused financial shortages he cited a 15day curfew imposed last 
month on the bureij camp after its arab municipality resigned in 
response to threats from leaders of the 7monthold arab uprising 
since the uprising began in december 222 palestinians and four 
israelis have been killed 
the official also blamed a sixweek ban on gazans leaving for 
work in israel and arabordered commercial strikes for the economic 
difficulties 
the official said the army was letting un relief trucks 
deliver basic food supplies to the camps and said there was no 
real food shortage what youve got is shortages of money he 
said 
the israeli daily haaretz however quoted an israeli reserve 
trooper friday as saying in the past few days i have given out 
watermelons cantaloupes and some even come and beg me for bread 
we know there is a severe food shortage in the camps

gov arch moore ceremoniously snipped a 
ribbon friday to open the last 36mile link of interstate highway 
system in his state but businesses on a competing road say the new 
route spells disaster for them 
after two decades of delay the completed stretch of interstate 
64 between sam black church and beckley creates 1125 miles of 
continuous fourlane travel from norfolk va to st louis 
the new road should shave an hour off the travel time between 
charleston and white sulphur springs in the southeastern part of 
the state reducing the trip to 1 hours 
at the opening ceremony moore called the 3135 million link a 
monument to progress 
but for businesses along a 190stretch of twolane us 60 
which has been southern west virginias lifeline for decades i64 
can only mean a drastic drop in travelers 
i think itll be really disastrous said pat rogers who 
works at pioneer village country store in chimney corner 45 miles 
east of charleston 
given a choice i dont think anyone will drive us 60 
rogers said you can be there for days 
us 60 snakes over and around steep mountains and the narrow 
lanes are crowded by coaltruck convoys that often slow traffic to 
15 or 20 mph 
the 2hour trip from charleston to lewisburg on the virginia 
border is whiteknuckle driving state department of highways 
spokesman john gallagher said 
the state expects a sharp decline in attendance at hawks nest 
and babcock state parks along us 60 
im convinced that there will be an impact and that it will 
not be a positive one said state commerce commissioner robert 
trocin 
but officials are hoping that the drop in visitors to the parks 
will be more than offset by the expected boost i64 will have in 
the tourism economy of the depressed southern counties now heavily 
dependent on coal 
they estimate that i64 will increase the number of travelers on 
the interstate system in southern west virginia by 20 to 40 percent 
we will see an influx of commercial building and development 
that hasnt been available to us before said beckleyraleigh 
county chamber of commerce president bill wilbur 
as originally planned i64 would have run along us 60s 
route in the mid1960s however the route was changed to protect 
wetlands and to shorten the road causing years of construction 
delays instead of running directly from lewisburg to charleston 
it now runs to beckley 51 miles south of the capital 
fridays dedication took place on the east end of the 29 
million glade creek bridge on a platform festooned with red white 
and blue balloons joining moore were former govs hulett smith and 
okey patteson and the states two us senators and four 
congressmen 
the department of highways estimated the turnout at 10000 but 
moore put the figure at 50000 traffic was backed up for several 
miles in the broiling sun as motorists and spectators waited for 
the dignitaries to snip the ribbon and open the road to traffic

what could comedian jay leno and 
millionaire publisher malcolm forbes possibly have in common 
money senses of humor 
but it was their love of motorcycles that brought them together 
thursday night at caesars palace 
forbes who publishes forbes magazine stopped in las vegas 
while on an 1800mile motorcycle ride from his colorado ranch to 
los angeles 
the millionaire is scheduled to appear as lenos guest on the 
tonight show in burbank on monday night 
forbes first appeared on the show as lenos guest in 1985 and 
the two have become friends both share an interest in motorcycles

hungary has asked us experts for help 
in a controversial multibillion dollar hydroelectric dam project 
on the danube river the official news agency mti reported friday 
the news agency said the government is consulting san 
franciscobased bechtel group inc about the dams operation and 
the likely environmental consequences of its construction 
the gabcikovonagymaros dam on the hungarianczechoslovak border 
has pitted the communist government against environmentalists who 
say the project and its 140mile rerouting of the danube will flood 
fertile farmland and destroy natural forests and wildlife 
hungarian and austrian environmentalists oppose the project 
czechoslovak scientists also questioned the environmental 
consequences of the project 
construction began in early 1980s and a completion date has been 
pushed back several times government officials hope to complete 
the project by 1990 
seventy percent of the construction work in hungary will be 
carried out by austrian companies in exchange for 15 years of 
electricity for austria from the finished project 
the new openness evident in hungarys staterun media and 
politics in the past six weeks prompted unprecedented public 
coverage of environmentalists complaints about the planned dam and 
raised questions about halting construction 
similar vast projects in the soviet union were halted in the 
past two years as soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
increased openness brought more attention to environmental 
questions and catastrophes 
in june parliamentarian zoltan kiraly proposed that work on the 
project be suspended while a team of foreign experts evaluated its 
economic efficiency 
his proposal for suspension was rejected but word that the 
government plans to consult bechtel corp indicated it is now 
willing to bring in foreign experts 
the government is to report to the parliament on the project in 
the fall 
officials maintain that stopping construction would cost about 
11 billion in payments to austria czechoslovakia and hungarian 
companies for breach of contract 
officials estimate the cost of completing the dam at 108 
billion environmentalists contend inflation will push costs to 
26 billion 
mti quoted ervin zsuffa deputy minister of environment and 
water management as saying the bechtel study should examine 
environmental aspects of the project so that water and energy 
management could be adjusted accordingly

michael dukakis today dismissed as unnecessary jesse jacksons 
proposal for former president carter to act as a mediator between 
their two campaigns 
we dont need mediators the nomineetobe said in an 
interview in the governors office in boston 
dukakis said he and jackson talked eariler today but he refused 
to discuss the substance of the conversation 
asked if he expected jacksons name to be offered to the 
convention for the vice presidential nomination dukakis said he 
didnt know 
in louisville jackson declined to discuss the phone call except 
in general terms 
clearly the governor understands the steps that are now 
necessary for unity and partnership to be achieved he said 
asked if he would allow his name to be put into nomination 
thursday night for vice president jackson replied thats really 
a moot question 
dukakis rejection of the mediation proposal came after 
democratic party chief paul kirk dismissed the idea and aides to 
jackson also expressed doubts about it 
as jackson left indianapolis today on the second day of his bus 
trip to atlanta and next weeks national convention his convention 
manager ron brown said the tension between the campaigns isnt a 
question of personal pique or personal relationships 
its a question of equity its a question of partnership 
brown said on cbs this morning 
dukakis insisted thursday he has a good relationship with 
jackson even as his remaining rival asked carter to help resolve 
the creative tensions between them 
kirk disagreed with jackson 
i dont think in my view that the fact that there has been 
some miscommunication at this point requires the president of the 
united states to come to the table kirk said on cbs i think 
that ron and his counterpart susan estrich ought to come to 
the table within the next several hours talk over the issues get 
the platform discussions back on track and be ready for a real 
celebration of unity here as we prepare for the fall campaign 
brown said that any role for carter was not clear yet 
frankly weve come to no conclusion on that 
bert lance the jackson adviser and former carter white house 
official said in an interview im not sure its necessary 
mike and jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with 
however lance also said some involvement by carter could help 
dukakis with jacksons followers 
rep charles rangel of new york a jackson supporter said it 
was lance who came up with the carter idea but lance declined to 
confirm that he was budget director for carter in the white house 
we will exercise all of our rights jackson said in chicago 
before joining a sevenbus motorcade it is an open convention 
we are prepared to deliberate and debate tuesday wednesday 
and thursday 
jackson remained indignant over the handling of the selection of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as dukakiss running mate 
the bostonaustin connection leaves chicago out of the 
equation he said but he also spoke of reconciliation 
we hope in the next three or four days that matters will be 
resolved jackson said at an indianapolis news conference he 
added that he expected a meeting with dukakis at some appropriate 
time 
meanwhile a new state poll suggested the choice of bentsen had 
helped the democratic ticket in texas adopted home state of 
republican george bush 
and bush took advantage of his status as vice president going 
to the united nations to defend us actions surrounding the 
downing of an iranian airliner 
i will not dignify with a response the charge that we 
deliberately destroyed iran air 655 bush told the security 
council the foreign minister of iran knows better he knows that 
this tragedy was an accident 
it was to be bushs last public appearance for a week as he is 
scheduled to leave for a sixday fishing trip on saturday 
jackson spent the night in indianapolis and his bus caravan was 
taking him today to louisville ky and nashville tenn 
dukakis was spending today focusing on state government business 
in boston 
the massachusetts governor avoided public questioning on 
jackson but repeated in a cbs news interview that he had 
apologized to jackson for failing to reach him before news of the 
choice of lloyd bentsen of texas as his running mate 
jesse and i have had a good relations over the past couple of 
months and thats going to continue dukakis said 
asked if he expects that television viewers will see jackson on 
the podium for a unity picture on the last night of the convention 
next week dukakis was optimistic i expect that you will 
campaign aides said efforts were under way to arrange a meeting 
between dukakis and jackson in atlanta on sunday the day dukakis 
is scheduled to arrive jacksons bus trip is slated to wrap up 
saturday afternoon with a big atlanta rally 
jackson raised new possibilities as he began his bus trip 
revealing that he had called carter early thursday morning to ask 
him to mediate 
a new nbc newswall street journal poll nationally gave dukakis 
about a 10point lead the survey of 1695 registered voters july 
811 gave dukakis 46 percent bush 36 percent that is a similar 
margin to other polls but five points below the margin found in a 
june poll

the city of atlanta won a ruling from the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals on friday in its dispute with 
demonstrators who sought to march on a street adjacent to the 
democratic national convention site 
the appeals court noted that the city had given permission for 
demonstrators to march within one block of the buildings housing 
convention activities 
the visibility of the parade from the actual convention site 
is not significantly diminished by holding it a block away the 
court said 
alternative 88 a coalition of protest groups planning to 
demonstrate during next weeks convention had filed suit after the 
city refused to allow parades on a section of marietta street next 
to the omni hotel and the georgia world congress center 
us district judge orinda evans ruled last week that the city 
has a significant government interest in guaranteeing 
delegates access to the convention and therefore was justified in 
barring parades on the street from monday through thursday 
the appeals court upheld the lower court ruling

tammy bakker defied a request by the ptl 
bankruptcy trustee that she not visit certain parts of heritage 
usa and the trustee says he may have to ban the bakkers completely 
from the religious theme park 
mrs bakker attended the filming of the ptl today television 
show thursday ignoring mc red bentons request that the 
evangelical couple voluntarily restrict their activities to the 
west side of the railroad tracks of heritage usa 
jim bakkers parents live on the grounds west of the tracks and 
benton said thursday he did not want to limit the couples access 
to them the studio mrs bakker visited is east of the tracks 
the bakkers moved back to the area recently to mount their drive 
to regain control of the ptl ministry which they lost in 1987 in a 
sexandmoney scandal 
benton was appointed by the us bankruptcy court to oversee the 
sale of heritage usa property to pay ptls creditors a buyer is 
expected to be named next month he said he decided to limit the 
bakkers access to heritage usa after several incidents in which he 
felt the bakkers presence was disruptive 
in one incident mrs bakker and russell deshields a drummer in 
the ptl band engaged in a shouting match in front of the studio 
audience 
benton said ptls attorneys contacted the bakkers attorney 
ryan hovis to ask the couple if they were going to deliberately 
test me to see what i would do 
but hovis said i dont think thats fair i dont think its 
right for the bakkers to have to stay away from the ministry they 
created 
mrs bakkers visit to the studio on thursday was without 
incident said ptl security chief gene ervin he said she quietly 
watched the show and left before it ended 
everything was nice and calm he said 
bakker meanwhile said he wished benton had contacted him about 
the matter directly instead of going through attorneys 
i think if mr benton wants to say that he should have the 
courtesy to call me or write a letter telling me so bakker said 
ill be glad to notify them if they want to provide security 
thats fine

the united states recorded a 109 billion 
trade deficit in may the second smallest imbalance in almost three 
years the government said friday in a report that sent the dollar 
soaring on foreign currency markets 
the reagan administration and private economists were in 
agreement that the commerce department report offered conclusive 
proof that the governments efforts to deal with one of the 
countrys biggest economic problems a seemingly intractable trade 
imbalance were beginning to show results 
the may deficit was actually 627 million higher than a revised 
april imbalance of 103 billion but the april figure was the 
smallest imbalance since a 99 billion deficit in august 1985 and 
the may deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time 
financial markets which had been braced for a higher deficit 
figure rallied on the news the dollar jumped sharply on foreign 
exchange markets rising by almost one cent against the british 
pound and nearly one japanese yen in london trading 
commerce secretary c william verity noted that for the first 
five months of this year american exports have surged by 31 
percent compared with the same period in 1987 reflecting the boom 
conditions in american manufacturing brought on by the weaker 
dollar 
the merchandise trade figures for may are consistent with the 
trend toward a lower trade deficit verity said the 
improvement in the trade balance in the first five months has been 
widespread geographically 
the administration launched an effort three years ago with major 
us allies to devalue the dollar as a way of making american goods 
more competitive on overseas markets 
but the strategy took much longer than expected to bear fruit 
with continued huge deficits fueling protectionist fires in 
congress last year the trade deficit soared to an alltime high 
of 1703 billion 
for the first five months of this year however the deficit is 
running at an annual rate of 1407 billion a 30 billion 
improvement if it holds for the rest of the year 
there can be no doubt that we have turned the corner in a big 
way on our trade deficit said allen sinai chief economist of 
the boston co 
us exports climbed 23 percent in may to 266 billion 31 
percent higher than a year ago this increase helped offset a 34 
percent rise in imports which climbed to 376 billion the trade 
deficit is the difference between imports and exports 
part of the increase in imports reflected a higher foreign oil 
bill which jumped 177 percent to 39 billion in may 
analysts said they looked for some further modest improvements 
in trade for the rest of the year with some suggesting that the 
deficit would dip below 10 billion in coming months 
but bruce steinberg an economist with the merrill lynch 
investment firm said the bulk of the improvement in trade for this 
year has already occurred 
imports arent going to be falling because domestic demand is 
sufficiently strong to keep that from happening he said 
the rise in imports in may reflected increases of 11 billion 
in industrial supplies and smaller rises in imports of capital 
goods imports of autos fell by 600 million during the month 
analysts said this provided evidence that the price increases 
caused by the weaker dollar were beginning to have an effect on 
domestic demand 
the increase in exports in may reflected a 300 million rise in 
agricultural shipments a 300 million advance in sales of capital 
goods and a 100 million rise in sales of american autos and parts 
overseas 
by country the biggest deficit as usual was with japan an 
imbalance of 41 billion down slightly from the april imbalance 
of 44 billion for the first five months of the year the 
japanese trade imbalance has shrunk by 11 percent over the same 
period a year ago 
the improvement in the deficit with western europe has been a 
much more substantial 47 percent over the same time period for 
may the deficit with the european community totaled 19 billion 
the deficit with canada the largest us trading partner was 
11 billion while the deficit with the newly industrialized 
nations of south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore was 24 
billion in may 
the substantial trade improvement has been a key factor in the 
betterthanexpected economic growth the nation has enjoyed so far 
this year boom times in manufacturing helped drop the us 
unemployment rate to a 14year low of 53 percent in june 
many economists believe nearly half of the economys growth this 
year will come from an improving trade performance

the supreme court rejected a request to 
reopen an investigation of the 1976 assassination in washington of 
a chilean dissident 
the request was filed by lawyers for the family of the 
dissident orlando letelier and was based on new testimony in a 
us court by a former chilean army major who acknowledged a role 
in the killing 
the supreme courts unanimous ruling was made thursday night and 
was published friday by santiago newspapers 
letelier family lawyers argued that the new investigation was 
necessary following testimony before a washington court by armando 
fernandez larios the army major who surrendered to us 
authorities in january 1987 and admitted to being an accomplice in 
the killing 
letelier and an american aide ronni moffitt were killed when a 
remotecontrol bomb blew up his car on sept 21 1976 as it 
rounded sheridan circle on washingtons embassy row 
letelier a socialist and former ambassador and cabinet minister 
under marxist president salvador allende was a prominent and 
influential critic of the rightwing military government of 
president augusto pinochet 
pinochet took power in the 1973 coup that toppled allende 
the supreme court said in its ruling that fernandez larios us 
district court testimony cannot be considered as better 
information 
it also noted the testimony was made after a pleabargain 
agreement plea bargaining is barred by chilean law 
in 1978 a washington court indicted fernandez larios and two 
other chilean army officers all secret police agents in 
connection with the letelier killing the chilean supreme court 
rejected a us request for the extradition of the three officers 
but last year fernandez larios slipped out of the country and 
surrendered to american authorities in washington 
in 1987 the reagan administration again called on chile to hand 
over the other two officers gen manuel contreras a former secret 
police chief and a top aide col pedro espoinoza chile refused

wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 percent 
in june the government said friday but analysts saw cause for 
worry in the steep droughtinduced climb in raw food prices 
the labor department said the hot dry weather searing much of 
the nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by 
more than 20 percent last month pushing raw food prices 42 
percent higher than in may it was the biggest jump since october 
1985 
food prices rose a lower but still substantial 11 percent at 
the wholesale level one step before retail stores economists said 
that it was only a matter of time before price bulges at earlier 
production stages show up on supermarket shelves 
food price inflation looks like it will be with us for many 
months to come said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co the report suggests to me that we remain in the beginning 
stages of a potentially spiraling inflationary process with no 
relief in sight 
other analysts however were less pessimistic pointing to a 
drop in energy prices and generally modest increases in other areas 
energy prices fell 16 percent with a 71 percent decline in 
fuel oil leading the way gasoline and natural gas fell 24 percent 
and 10 percent respectively 
thats a real break because the last few times we had 
droughts we also had doubledigit increases in energy prices 
said michael k evans a private economic consultant in washington 
energy prices are heading down for the rest of the summer 
he said noting a sharp drop between midjune and midjuly in the 
price of crude oil to the lowest level in nearly two years 
subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices 
wholesale prices rose 03 percent last month the same as in may 
analysts consider this rate a better indication of underlying 
inflationary pressures in the economy 
in other economic news 
the commerce department said the us trade deficit rose 
slightly in may to 109 billion up from 103 billion in april 
but the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost three 
years both exports and imports increased 
the federal reserve board said production at the nations 
factories mines and utilities rose a moderate 04 percent in june 
the ninth consecutive month without a decline production at 
utilities surged 26 percent primarily for air conditioning during 
the heat wave 
business inventories in may rose a moderate 06 percent to 
7284 billion held in check by a 09 percent jump in sales the 
commerce department said sales rose to 4837 billion 
june wholesale price increases pushed the labor departments 
producer price index for finished goods to 1079 meaning that a 
selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 cost 10790 last month 40 
cents more than in may this calculation is not adjusted for 
seasonal variations as are other calculations in the report 
if the june price rise held for 12 straight months the 
inflation rate would be 46 percent annually more than double the 
22 percent rise of 1987 
for the first half of 1988 prices one step short of retail rose 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 36 percent excluding food 
and energy wholesale costs rose at 40 percent rate over that 
period 
although overall wholesale prices rose a modest 03 percent in 
january and fell 02 percent in february theyve been up 04 
percent or 05 percent from march through june 
the consumer price index which tracks prices at the retail 
level and also includes services and imported goods not in the 
wholesale price report has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 44 percent over the first five months of the year the 
same rate as for all of 1987 
consumer price figures for june will be released next week 
stacy kottman an economist with georgia state university in 
atlanta said the worst effects of the drought may not be felt by 
consumers until late this year because meat prices will initially 
come down as farmers slaughter animals rather than pay expensive 
feed prices 
cattle prices for example fell 52 percent in june while hog 
prices were down 40 percent 
but when the droughtrelated slaughtering tapers off curtailed 
supply will drive up the price of meat he said 
it takes anywhere from 12 to 14 months to raise a calf from 
birth to slaughter size so it will be well into nxt year and early 
1990 before meat prices can come down again kottman said 
the labor department offered these details from its producer 
price report 
at the unprocessed level wheat was up 253 percent corn 243 
percent turkeys 228 percent soybeans 220 percent and 
chickens 225 percent 
at the finishedgoods level prices for eggs rose 160 percent 
turkey 93 percent chicken 73 percent and fresh fruit 67 
percent vegetable prices dropped 57 percent and rice was down 22 
percent 
also at the finished level passenger car prices were up 10 
percent womens clothing up 10 percent home electronic 
equipment down 22 percent and cosmetics down 06 percent 
the producer price index measures the price of goods at three 
levels of production crude or unprocessed for example wheat or 
cotton intermediate flour or cloth and finished wholesale 
bread and clothing

nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann 
ending three days of uncertainty said today he will comply with a 
reagan administration demand that he depart the united states 
tunnermann made his announcement less than three hours before 
the 530 pm edt state departmentimposed deadline for him to 
leave the country 
at the same time tunnermann said nicaragua planned to take its 
case against the us expulsion order to the legal committee of the 
organization of american states 
he said that oas ambassadors should be protected against 
arbitary treatment by the united states tunnermann serves both 
as ambassador to the united states and to the oas 
if tunnermann had chosen to stay he would have become an 
illegal alien but would have been protected by us law from 
summary expulsion and guaranteed a hearing 
asked why he did not defy the expulsion order tunnermann said 
we think the us administration could have used this as an 
argument against us to continue its aggression against our people 
tunnermann planned to take a 515 pm flight to mexico 
however his wife and seven children planned to remain in the 
washington area 
she also is attached to nicaraguas oas mission and is not 
affected by the expulsion order 
president reagan had said earlier he expected tunnermann to 
observe comply with the expulsion order by the deadline 
asked what the us government would do if tunnermann defied the 
deadline reagan told reporters were expecting him to leave at 
that hour beyond that hour he is here illegally 
i dont know where hell hide the president said 
indicating the government would enforce its expulsion order if 
necessary hes illegally here beyond that period of time we 
expect him to be going to the airport or to leave 
reagan made the comments during an oval office picturetaking 
session with visiting un secretary general perez de cuellar 
on tuesday reagan gave tunnermann and seven other nicaraguan 
diplomats 72 hours to leave the country in retaliation for the 
expulsion of us ambassador richard melton and seven colleages 
from nicaragua 
the 72 hours is up at 530 white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters as the president said yesterday we 
expect him to leave if he doesnt leave he is subject to 
enforcement of the laws 
he did not say which laws he was referring to 
tunnermann went before the organization of american states 
permanent council thursday to make his case against the us 
decision accusing the reagan administration of violating 
international law by expelling him 
most of the oas delegates remained silent during the 100minute 
meeting with few willing to take a stand on either side of this 
latest chapter in the longrunning usnicaraguan dispute 
tunnermann did not ask the group to take any actions on his 
behalf and no resolutions were introduced 
much of the time was spent with tunnermann and us ambassador 
richard mccormack dueling over responsibility for the continued 
strife in nicaragua 
tunnermann who serves as nicaraguas ambassador to both the 
united states and the oas said the administration has no right to 
expel diplomats accredited to the oas 
it is a sovereign decision of our states that the host 
country must respect to designate its representation before the 
permanent council he said 
mccormack said a 1975 agreement with the oas gives the united 
states the right to expel oas envoys who behave in an undiplomatic 
manner 
he said tunnermann and a nicaraguan military attache major 
pedro sampson had engaged in certain activities which violated 
their privileges of residence in the united states the two were 
among eight nicaraguans ordered home by the united states after the 
sandinista government expelled eight american diplomats including 
ambassador richard melton 
mccormack refused to specify what the two envoys did wrong nor 
has anyone else in the administration 
tunnermann insisted that he and his colleagues had 
scrupulously observed diplomatic norms during their stay here 
we have been so careful he said that we cant even be 
accused of not paying fines for small traffic violations 
mccormack said the administration had deferred expelling 
tunnermann and sampson earlier in order to avoid giving the 
nicaraguan government a pretext for ordering home us diplomats 
he added that the expulsion of the eight americans this week 
removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the united 
states 
tunnermann got a limited expression of support from mexican 
ambassador antonio icaza who acted as spokesman for a group of 
eight latin american nations 
icaza said oas governments have a right to appoint their 
washington ambassadors but this authority is inadequately 
protected under the 1975 usoas agreement 
as a consequence he said it is necessary to fill this 
legal vacuum 
the reagan administration has said it expected tunnermann and 
his colleagues to comply with the expulsion order but the envoy was 
noncommittal thursday when asked by reporters about his plans 
president reagan said tunnermann would have a big surprise 
awaiting him if he decided to ignore the us demand but the 
threat was not spelled out

jesse jackson headed south today looking for 
conciliation with michael dukakis as top democrats questioned 
whether president carter was needed to mediate tensions between the 
two camps 
jackson who called on carter to help ease the rift insisted 
thursday we have every reason to seek a bridge spanning 
differences between him and the nomineetobe 
we hope that in the next three or four days that matters will 
be resolved with dukakis forces jackson said no doubt were 
not going to give up on communications 
jackson in the second day of his threeday bus trek to next 
weeks convention in atlanta has expressed irritation over his 
perceived snub during the selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen for 
the no 2 spot 
but he sent conciliatory signals stressing ways to rebuild 
relations with dukakis 
first he said he had spoken with former president jimmy carter 
about serving as a gobetween carter has not said publicly whether 
he will play any such role later jackson suggested that top 
policymakers from the two campaigns should talk 
the chief policy advisers of both camps have not met he 
said maybe they could be a bridge in the process we have every 
reason to seek a bridge 
in boston dukakis dismissed the idea we dont need 
mediators he said 
paul kirk the party chairman said today he sees no need for 
carter to be called in to mediate instead he said on cbs this 
morning top advisers to jackson and dukakis ought to come to 
the table within the next several hours talk over the issues get 
the platform discussions back on track and be ready for a real 
celebration 
bert lance the jackson adviser and former carter white house 
official said in an interview im not sure its necessary 
mike and jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with 
however lance also said some involvement by carter could help 
dukakis with jacksons followers 
on the same program ron brown jacksons convention manager 
said no one should doubt that jackson will support the 
dukakisbentsen ticket 
the question is what is the level and intensity of the 
support of his constituents going to be and that is going to be 
dependent upon michael dukakis the message of the party the 
direction of the party brown said 
at a news conference on his arrival in indianapolis jackson was 
asked if there was reason for optimism that platform and other 
differences with dukakis could be worked out and he said i 
certainly hope so 
at some appropriate time together we will meet no 
doubt jackson said 
jackson declined to be specific about what he would seek in 
return for his help in turning out black voters but said his 
session with dukakis should be a meeting of substance 
he also left open the possiblity that his forces will put his 
name into nomination for vice president 
we have not yet made a decision about all the strategies well 
employ jackson said 
jackson aide brown said today that the campaign has no present 
plans to put jesse jacksons name up for vice president 
the bus caravan aimed at bringing back memories of the civil 
rights era was also headed for louisville ky nashville and 
chattanooga in tennessee before arriving in atlanta on saturday 
the caravan had been billed as a sort of rolling juggernaut 
building steam as it headed south but jackson spent most of 
thursday closeted in his bus or meeting with advisers 
most of the passengers were reporters rather than jackson 
backers there were at least 110 in the press entourage while 
jackson supporters numbered between 30 and 35 
were not picking up passengers were registering jackson 
said because of travel time were not encouraging additional 
passengers 
at a jammed church here thursday night jackson returned to his 
fiery speaking style but focused on efforts to register new voters 
for the fall fight against the likely gop nominee george bush 
were getting ready to send bush back into private life 
jackson said were picking up registrations all the way down the 
line

ten commercial fishermen plus 21 fish 
dealers markets and restaurants were charged friday in a sting in 
which an undercover game warden was able to buy and sell illegally 
caught redfish 
more than 1600 of the popular but endangered fish weighing a 
total of more than 8000 pounds were illegally bought and sold 
said officials of the texas parks and wildlife department 
this may be a greater crime than the theft of money or goods 
because when redfish are gone they can never be replaced said 
capt jim robertson supervisor of coastal law enforcement for the 
department every redfish illegally taken from the texas coastal 
waters is something stolen from every texan not only today but for 
future generations 
commercial fishing for redfish has been illegal in texas since 
1981 texas was the first state to protect redfish but now states 
from texas to north carolina have passed laws to protect the 
species from overharvesting officials said 
last year the national marine fisheries service prohibited 
taking of redfish from federal water leaving the northern coast of 
mexico from the texas border to vera cruz as the only place redfish 
can be taken commercially said david cottom of the wildlife 
department 
all the illegally caught redfish plus some spotted sea trout 
were caught in the seadrift area on the texas gulf coast 
robertson said it took about a year for the game warden to 
establish himself as a fish dealer the actual sting operation ran 
for about two months beginning in april 
its going to be continuing were going to start another 
one he said 
we certainly hope theyre a little more careful and hope they 
abide by the regulations robertson said the message today to 
all who illegally sell or buy redfish is that we take that 
responsibility to protect the fish very seriously 
the game warden bought fish from fishermen then called or 
visited buyers all transactions were conducted without any of the 
documentation required to sell redfish imported from other states 
or countries and both sellers and buyers knew it robertson said 
the problem of illegal fishing is widespread he said 
this involved 10 fishermen in one small area theres many 
small fishing villages like that on the texas coast it could be 
massive he said 
the charges filed in the case were various grades of 
misdemeanors carrying penalties that include substantial fines and 
up to a year in jail in addition some violators could be assessed 
civil penalties with a charge for each fish bought illegally 
restitution costs could top 160000 officials said

the dukakis and jackson campaigns already had 
smoothed out most of their differences on the democratic platform 
before the jackson side called a halt to the formal negotiations 
jacksons convention manager said friday 
ron brown said that when jackson broke off the negotiations 
wednesday the platform was close to completed we had dealt with 
most of the issues 
if the talks resume brown said in an interview in atlanta 
wed be close to signing off on it 
in washington sources on the platform committee said the 
dukakis and jackson campaigns had been seeking a compromise on the 
middle east that would speak of human rights for all under the camp 
david accords and make a specific reference to the palestinians 
dukakis platform representatives rejected out of hand last month 
in denver jacksons call for selfdetermination for the 
palestinians 
the sources who asked not to be identified said it was likely 
that the dukakis forces would accept a jackson minority plank on 
child care and family issues while voting down jacksons call for 
higher taxes and a military freeze 
jackson has reserved the right to take as many as 13 issues to 
the floor for votes tuesday when the convention takes up the 
platform 
but his negotiators said from the outset it was unlikely they 
would pursue them all 
brown said that most of the work that remains to be done on the 
platform deals with the format and how it will be presented to the 
convention 
brown said he is in touch with susan estrich and paul brountas 
dukakis campaign manager and chairman but they were discussing 
the larger questions of jacksons role in the fall campaign not 
the specific platform and convention matters 
michael barnes and eleanor holmes norton the chief platform 
negotiators for the dukakis and jackson campaigns respectively 
left washington friday for atlanta 
four years ago in san francisco the democrats rebuffed jackson 
by lopsided votes on three minority planks a call for a policy of 
no first use of nuclear weapons substantial cuts in 
defense spending and elimination of runoff primaries while 
accepting a compromise jackson proposal on affirmative action that 
convention also adopted gary harts call for limits on use of us 
military forces overseas 
jackson has nearly 1150 delegates going to the atlanta 
convention three times as many as he had in san francisco

us industrial production boosted by heavy 
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave climbed 04 
percent in june the ninth consecutive month without a decline the 
government said friday 
the federal reserve said the june advance followed identical 
gains of 05 percent in both april and may and left output 58 
percent higher than it was a year ago 
analysts said the continued improvement showed that american 
manufacturers were still benefiting from an export boom which has 
helped push the nations jobless rate down to a 14year low of 53 
percent while giving the country the smallest trade deficits it has 
seen in almost three years 
manufacturing remains the healthiest sector of the economy 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co we continue 
to move ahead with an economy driven by the industrial side 
but david wyss an economist with data resources inc said the 
june advance reflected in large part a big 26 percent rise in the 
output at the nations utilities 
manufacturing showed a much smaller 02 percent rise in output 
we are looking for the increases in industrial production to 
slow in coming months he said reflecting an overhang of 
inventories at the consumer level that needs to be worked down 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said in testimony 
earlier this week that the central bank was also looking for 
industrial output to slow he said this would be considered a good 
sign that inflationary pressures were easing 
the 02 percent rise in manufacturing reflected a 03 percent 
increase for factories making durable goods items expected to last 
three or more years and a smaller 01 percent rise in production 
of nondurable goods 
while production of chemical products increased the nondurable 
sector was held back by declines in the output of textiles and 
paper 
autos were assembled at an annual rate of 75 million units in 
june unchanged from may production of light trucks while still 
at a high level edged down slightly last month 
production of business equipment showed continued strength with 
a gain of 05 percent pushing output in this sector 91 percent 
above a year ago the increase last month reflected solid gains in 
all major components except construction mining and farm 
equipment the report said 
output in the mining industry a category that includes oil and 
gas drilling rose 06 percent in june partially reversing a 14 
percent drop in may 
the various changes left industrial production at a seasonally 
adjusted 1366 percent of its 1977 base of 100

rolling south aboard his rainbow 
express bus caravan jesse jackson spoke again with certain 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis friday agreeing to 
a meeting of top staffers from the two camps and talking 
accommodation instead of discord 
we simply cannot win without each other jackson said at a 
news conference along the route to the democratic convention in 
atlanta we can only win with each other it is in our distinct 
advantage to find common ground 
in addition jackson continued to reach out to other top 
democrats this time talking with new york gov mario cuomo he 
didnt say what they discussed 
jackson said he called dukakis just prior to a noon rally and 
both agreed that their top policy advisers should meet in atlanta 
saturday night to discuss differences over democratic policies 
it does not signal yet the resumption of negotiations 
jackson said but added 
given the creative tension in the past few days taking a 
diplomative initiative to get more people involved is the right 
thing to do jackson said he dukakis agreed its the right 
thing to do 
in preparation for the meeting jackson scheduled a gathering of 
his aides in nashville friday night 
he said the two have no acrimony and hostility and have only 
policy matters to resolve 
i see the tension were going through as normal and healthy 
jackson said 
but jackson made it clear his role should be significant 
people have asked repeatedly what do we expect jackson 
said it is not mysterious we want a commitment in the platform 
and by the nominee to new priorities and to peace 
we seek partnership and shared responsibility in a plan to win 
in the fall jackson said we seek a seat at the table in a 
plan to govern in the spring 
jackson declined to say whether a personal meeting between 
himself and dukakis had been scheduled repeating only that they 
no doubt will meet at some time 
we obviously have a common interest in a successful 
convention jackson said 
but jackson made it clear that conservative forces have had 
their day with the selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen to the no 
2 spot and its the liberals turn 
all of the talks about conservative democrats jackson said 
they lost in the south on super tuesday 
jackson battled dukakis for the presidential nomination for 
months then lobbied for the vice presidential nomination he was 
then miffed at dukakis failure to tell him in advance of bentsens 
selection 
the caravan leaving ripples of attention as it moved south 
included seven buses and an equal number of cars inside were about 
120 reporters and photographers 30 or so supporters and about a 
dozen delegates staffers said 
they arrived in louisville at midday for jackson to have lunch 
at an innercity church 
construction workers stared curiously at the buses festooned 
with banners and posters and knots of people gathered each time 
the motorcade swept into a city 
at rallies along the way jackson focused on mobilizing his 
supporters though the convention is sure to nominate dukakis for 
president and bentsen for vice president 
jacksons was the first bus in the caravan equipped with a 
kitchen he was accompanied by his children and advisers 
wife jackie was helping prepare for his arrival 
she was wise enough to fly to atlanta jackson said 
were not picking up passengers were registering jackson 
said because of travel time were not encouraging additional 
passengers 
in the midst of a tense weeklong focus on relations between 
the jackson and dukakis camps jackson took time to lob some fire 
at the republicans and their expected nominee george bush 
we survived reagan we can survive anything jackson said 
were getting ready to send bush back into private life

business inventories climbed in may for the 
17th consecutive month the government said friday but sales also 
rose strongly easing economists worries that too many goods are 
accumulating on shelves and back lots 
the commerce department said inventories rose 06 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 7284 billion while sales rose 09 percent to 
4837 billion 
the may gain in inventories followed a 05 percent climb in 
april and was the strongest since a 07 percent increase in january 
the jump in business sales came after a month of no change in 
april and a steep increase of 19 percent in march 
economists generally take a combination of rising inventories 
and falling sales as a sign of future production cutbacks however 
because sales rose srongly in may the jump in inventories is less 
troublesome 
although there is inventory accumulation occurring now it is 
in line with the fact that sales and production are increasing 
said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch if sales 
were to drop off then there would be reasons for concern but 
thats not the situation were in now 
inventories in may were 75 percent higher than a year ago 
while sales were 78 percent higher 
the may inventory buildup was boosted by a 08 percent climb at 
the retail level where sales were weakest a 07 percent increase 
at factories and a 03 percent increase at the wholesale level 
the strength in business sales was paced by a 14 percent 
increase at manufacturing plants wholesale sales climbed 06 
percent while retail sales edged up only 03 percent 
michael k evans an economic forecaster in washington said 
most of the retail inventory overhang occurred because of weak auto 
sales in may 
excluding cars retail inventories were up only 02 percent 
june car sales rebounded very strongly which means car 
inventories could be coming down he said 
an advance estimate of retail sales in june released thursday 
showed a 05 percent rise bolstered by a strong 12 percent rise 
in automotive buying 
the combination of strongly rising sales and moderately rising 
inventories held the inventorytosales ratio steady at 151 
percent in may the same as april that means it would take 151 
months to exhaust inventories at the april sales pace a ratio not 
considered abnormally high

a woman who was raped in her home after police 
responding to a 911 call searched outside found nothing and left 
sued the city friday blaming the attack on an inadequate telephone 
emergency system 
the rape feb 2 resulted in a shakeup of emergency procedures by 
the city and the reprimand of five officers and three 911 employees 
the suit filed in state court by the woman and her husband 
seeks unspecified damages 
the couple charged that the city failed to screen and train 911 
employees adequately and failed to correct procedures so 
deficient that the continued maintenance of them was outrageous and 
shocking to the conscience 
city public safety director glenn cannon and solicitor dan 
pellegrini declined comment friday 
the woman told police she dialed 911 about 1115 pm after 
hearing someone trying to break in to her secondstory apartment 
while she was talking to the 911 operator a man with a knife 
burst in and tore the telephone cord from the wall authorities 
said the 911 operator thought the woman had hung up officials 
said earlier this year 
when the intruder saw police walking around the house and heard 
them knocking on her door he threatened the woman and told her he 
had nothing further to lose and that he might as well rape her 
the woman said 
police searched outside for several minutes and left they 
didnt break down the door because 911 operators failed to tell 
them that the woman reported the breakin herself and that the call 
broke off authorities said 
no arrests have been made in the attack 
cannon ordered 911 operators to pass on detailed information 
about emergency calls and to question police about how they resolve 
calls before the officers are permitted to leave the scene

saudi arabia is using its oil wealth to 
acquire a multibilliondollar arsenal of arms that is soaring 
beyond selfdefense needs worrying israel and putting britain in a 
position to surpass the united states as the principal supplier to 
the persian gulf country 
even the state department usually sympathetic to the saudis 
pursuit of a modern military force is showing some concern because 
the new air force britain is providing and missiles from china are 
not subject to the kind of constraints washington would have 
insisted on 
the main rationale for the purchase of jet fighter planes 
helicopters and minehunting ships from britain and 
intermediaterange missiles from china is to counter iran which 
follows a muscular moslem course at odds with the zealous but 
conservative saudi royal dynasty 
but ironically iraq which is fighting iran in an eightyear 
war with financial help from the saudis may pose a longerrange 
threat to the kingdom in the view of some analysts 
the reagan administration has worked hard in congress to clear 
us weapons for the saudis the drive succeeded in 1981 when awacs 
radar planes were approved after a bitter fight and failed in 1985 
when the purchase of 40 f15 fighters was shelved under 
congressional attack as a potential threat to israel 
but when the saudi missile sale from china surfaced this year 
the state department grumbled about the saudis unwillingness to 
permit inspection of the rockets 
the chinese and the saudis offered assurances the missiles would 
not be made capable of carrying nuclear warheads and riyadh signed 
the international treaty against nuclear proliferation which 
provides for inspection 
when the saudis struck a 17 billion deal with britain this 
month for about 50 tornado jet fighters up to 60 hawk jet trainer 
aircraft more than 60 westland black hawk helicopters and six 
minesweeping vessels the state department argued that the weapons 
purchase one of the largest in history was not in the interest 
of the united states 
we think our interests are better served when we can sell 
legitimate selfdefense items to friendly arab countries when we 
can consult with them when we can put the regulations the 
restrictions on them that prevent threats to other countries 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
at the same time the department has consistently rejected any 
suggestion that the saudis might turn their arsenal against israel 
the oilrich state contributed money and at least token units in 
wars ainst the jewish state and supported the palestinian uprising 
on the west bank and in gaza 
the us constraints deny the saudis some of the sophisticated 
equipment that could make the weapons a bigger threat against 
israel also the saudis are sometimes barred from placing their 
weapons within easy striking distance of israel 
the british apparently imposed no restrictions on the range or 
location of the weapons they are selling to the saudis the deal is 
a followup to a 9 billion british sale in 1985 and means britain 
will overtake the united states as the principal saudi supplier 
at the same time london still maintains an arms embargo imposed 
against israel after the invasion of lebanon in 1982 
israeli officials have denounced the deal as regrettable 
cynical and potentially threatening since the saudis would be under 
tremendous pressure to throw the weapons into the mix in the 
event of another middle east war 
anthony cordesman a middle east scholar who advises sen john 
mccain rariz on national security affairs says the saudi 
buildup implements a strategy devised a few years ago with the 
united states to construct an effective air force as a deterrent to 
attack from either iran or iraq 
cordesman said the saudis are buying billions of dollars of arms 
not to threaten israel although the lack of constraints on the 
british arms poses a potential problem 
i dont think they are on a binge he said i think they 
very consistently have pursued the idea the only hope of having an 
effective deterrent is to have an effective air force he said 
from a strategic standpoint cordesman saw the united states and 
saudi arabia in a continuing partnership despite the purchases 
from britain and china only america can project the kind of power 
in the persian gulf that would protect the saudis in a major 
crisis while the saudis would provide bases and other help to the 
united states in wartime he said 
w seth carus an adjunct scholar at the washington institute 
for near east policy traces the buildup to the royal familys ties 
with the saudi defense establishment and riots last year in the 
holy city of mecca 
the saudis consider themselves the guardians of the holy 
places carus said the iranians were saying you dont have 
that right for the saudis that was a declaration of war the 
saudis found a real enemy 
shai feldman senior research associate at israels jaffee 
center for strategic studies said the saudis face a potential 
threat from iran during the current persian gulf war and from iraq 
once the war ends 
iraq has built its army up to 28 to 30 divisions in the war with 
iran and saudi arabia and the weaker gulf states are going to 
worry about the implications he said 
adding british tornados to the air force means the saudis will 
have a jet fighter capable of lowlevel penetration one that is 
more offenseoriented than others feldman said 
thats the real reason some israelis are worried he said

a husband cant sue his wifes lover for 
the emotional distress he suffered when he learned the lover had 
fathered her children a state appeals court ruled 
courts should stay out of such affairs it said thursday 
the innocent children here may suffer significant harm from 
having their family involved in litigation such as this the 1st 
district court of appeal said in ordering the suit dismissed on 
public policy grounds 
the court said however that a husband in such a situation 
might be able to sue for reimbursement of money he spent to support 
the children after being falsely told he was the father 
the san mateo county case involved a divorced couple identified 
by the court as gerald b and linda b and her lover richard p 
during the affair the court said linda gave birth to a 
daughter in 1983 and to a son in 1984 
she sued for separation from gerald in 1985 saying at the time 
that the children were his but in a settlement of the divorce case 
in january 1987 all parties agreed that richard was the father 
gerald sued richard the next month claiming fraud and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress and sought 175 
million in punitive damages 
the suit said richard knew shortly after the births that he was 
the father of both children but misled gerald into thinking he was 
the father congratulating him and agreeing to be the daughters 
godfather 
it was only after the children were one and two years old and 
gerald and his parents had become emotionally attached to them 
that he was told the truth he said 
superior court judge thomas smith refused to dismiss the suit 
but was overruled by the appeals court on a 30 vote 
while fraud and infliction of emotional distress normally are 
grounds for a damage suit the subject of this suit is not one in 
which it is appropriate for the courts to intervene said the 
opinion by justice jerome smith 
he distinguished the case from suits that have been allowed for 
deceit when a woman was infected with venereal disease that her 
lover had concealed or when a woman suffered an abnormal pregnancy 
and needed a lifesaving operation after her lover told her he was 
sterile 
both of those cases involved physical injuries and neither had a 
potential for harming innocent children smith said 
he also said allowing the suit would conflict with the public 
policy of encouraging natural fathers to acknowledge and support 
their children 
men in richards situation who are otherwise willing to 
voluntarily acknowledge and support their children would have a 
strong disincentive to do so since revealing the truth would 
subject them to this type of tort action smith said

atlanta ap walter mondale who lost the presidential race 
four years ago after a divided convention said friday democrats 
must avoid allowing tensions between jesse jackson and michael 
dukakis from going so far they set poison down into the roots 
and spoil chances for the ticket in the fall 
the former vice president who is staying out of the spotlight 
while democrats hold their convention in atlanta beginning monday 
said he hopes jackson will join in fully supporting the eventual 
democratic ticket with dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen and 
believes he will despite tensions now 
it is traditional almost to be expected that well have some 
struggles but it is how those struggles are conducted and whether 
theyll stay within the lines that allow the nominee to come out of 
the convention with a feeling in the public that hes ready to 
president mondale said 
i think rev jackson knows that he said 
we always have rising tensions about this time its inherent 
but i believe this is a year where democrats understand these 
fights if theyre carried on too far become too personalized 
they set poison down into the roots that can be difficult to deal 
with 
mondale in an interview with news agency reporters also said 
he believes dukakis failure to reach jackson by telephone to 
inform him of bentsens selection as vice president was not an 
intentional slight he said it should not be allowed to become the 
basis of crippling divisions 
it wasnt intentional he said noting that dukakis tried to 
call and was unsuccessful it would have been far better if the 
call had been completed in time but those things happen with the 
best of intentions 
the former party standard bearer loser in a landslide to 
president reagan in 1984 said he was not disappointed that he was 
not on the program to address the convention 
no the point here is to get dukakis elected bentsen elected 
its not to revive 1984 or any of those other things he said 
i would play it exactly the way mike is playing it hes got to 
be here on his own 
mondale appeared at the start of a daylong conference at the 
jimmy carter presidential center where democrats and political 
observers held seminars on the 1988 election and the american 
political system for 300 political and government leaders from 
foreign countries 
ron brown jacksons convention manager and top adviser offered 
a frank acknowledgement that jackson would not be the democratic 
nominee while saying he would still have his name placed in 
nomination for president 
although weve all concluded as i do that michael dukakis 
will be the nominee of the party there will actually be two names 
to go to the floor of the democratic national convention on 
wednesday night and those two names are jesse jackson and michael 
dukakis brown said 
he described jacksons campaign as altering the political 
landscape forever making race much less a factor in american 
politics today 
former president jimmy carter spoke to the group at a luncheon 
where he praised democratic national chairman paul kirk for having 
orchestrated what will be one of the most successful 
conventions that weve ever seen certainly in my political 
lifetime

republican leaders set up shop friday to snipe at 
the democrats during their convention next week and immediately 
began talking about the policy differences between michael dukakis 
and his running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said that regardless of 
whom republican george bush picks as his vice presidential 
candidate youre going to find only shades of difference in our 
philosophy not this chasm you find between dukakis on the one hand 
and lloyd bentsen on the other 
dukakis and bentsen have opposing views on subjects ranging from 
contra aid and the reagan economic program to key defense issues 
such as the mx missile the strategic defense initiative and the b1 
bomber dukakis has said he doesnt want bentsen to be a mere clone 
dole and rep lynn martin rill held a news conference at a 
downtown hotel to announce the opening of a gop media center 
making republican leaders available to reporters when they need a 
quote an opinion or a different perspective to round out a 
story the operation will run each day of the democratic 
convention next monday through thursday 
the planned speakers includes members of congress governors 
white house budget chief jim miller and others 
we are not here to be negative dole insisted we are here 
to be comparative 
calling the presidential election a crossroads for america dole 
said we can build on the stable recordsetting economic pace of 
the reaganbush years we can continue to pursue peace through 
strength or we can head down a road already traveled dole said 
do we want to go back to 1980 do we want a reunion with 
doubledigit inflation skyhigh interest rates massive 
unemployment and america held hostage overseas i dont think so 
the senator said 
we republicans have listened to america and the last thing the 
american people want is a radical wrenching 180degree change in 
direction dole added 
the news conference also highlighted differences among 
republicans when the two politicians were asked whether they think 
president reagan should sign a bill which the administration 
strongly opposes requiring advance notice to workers of plant 
closings 
ms martin said she opposes the bill but dole said that if he 
were president he might let it become law without his signature 
because a veto probably would be overridden polls show that a 
majority of americans support the bill and democrats plan to make 
it a campaign issue if reagan vetoes it 
in a way youd like it to go away cause its not an easy 
issue to explain rep martin commented 
dole also took the opportunity to advertise his availability as 
a possible running mate with bush 
while decrying the differences between dukakis and bentsen dole 
said the republicans did not have that problem i know i looked 
for sharp differences in my primary contest with george bush you 
couldnt find them whether it was the lineitem veto or balanced 
budget amendment or a strong defense or sdi they werent there 
you can certainly find them in looking over the comparison 
between my good friend lloyd bentsen and gov dukakis dole said 
while running against bush dole complained repeatedly that the 
vice president had not left his mark on foreign policy issues and 
other matters 
dole also mentioned ms martin as a possible running mate with 
bush she in turn mentioned doles wife elizabeth as well as 
the senator as possible candidates

two plaintiffs who lost a race discrimination 
lawsuit said friday a federal judges refusal to let their attorney 
use ms or her maiden name in court generated a furor that 
turned their trial into a sideshow 
this was a race discrimination lawsuit but it got lost in the 
shuffle somewhere along the line justice was not served here 
said charles gavin one of two plaintiffs 
gavin 43 of donora and william sutton 33 of washington who 
are black claimed ppg industries inc fostered and condoned racial 
harassment at the companys automotive windshield plant in nearby 
greensburg 
following a threeweek trial before senior us district judge 
hubert teitelbaum a jury cleared ppg 
the verdict came hours after teitelbaum apologized to gavins 
attorney barbara wolvovitz and offered to grant a mistrial 
following a flurry of headlines about his threats to jail ms 
wolvovitz for not using her husbands name 
gavin said the apology and offer for a mistrial which ms 
wolvovitz turned down was too little too late 
i dont know where to turn now i want to appeal and i want 
justice but i just dont have the money he said it almost 
cost me 10 grand to go this far as far as a mistrial what am i 
going to do about that the transcript alone will cost 6000 
gavin said teitelbaums behavior politicized that jury he 
alienated the jury from us these people perceived us and our 
lawyers as being radical 
i thought they were on our side until this guy started 
performing sutton said i think the comments he made were 
unprofessional and i think he prejudiced the jury by doing it 
the judge interrupted testimony july 8 to scold ms wolvovitz 
and threaten that she would sleep in the county jail if she 
refused to be called mrs lobel her husbands last name in court 
the judge found her cocounsel jon pushinsky in contempt for 
coming to her defense he also polled the female jurors on their 
preferences in courtesy titles 
ms wolvovitz on monday asked for a mistrial which the judge 
denied and when she again resisted his order to change her name he 
asked what if i call you sweetie 
he started out with this sweetie stuff and then it 
escalated gavin said he even patted her on her head at one 
point he put his hand around her waist even about my wife 
he said you have a beautiful wife dont you agree 
neither ms wolvovitz nor pushinski would confirm or deny their 
clients claims 
the record speaks for itself pushinski said 
its difficult to remember everything that took place in a 
3week trial ms wolvovitz said 
teitelbaum was not in his office friday and could not be reached 
for comment 
the judges law clerk joann dempler said teitelbaum is often 
informal in court making jokes and small talk to reduce tension 
but gavin said the judges actions on july 8 went beyond that 
the judge was screaming he was shouting he pointed at all 
these women and screamed at them whats your name when that man 
screamed and shouted i said oh my god whats this guy doing hes 
tampering with the jury 
gavin said ms wolvovitz was so shaken she sobbed while 
crossexamining a witness and that he in turn began to weep 
this man didnt apologize to sutton and me he said 
wheres the apology to us he had me crying

a federal judge has upheld cape cod national 
seashore guidelines allowing offroad vehicles on an eightmile 
stretch of beach defeating conservationists who claim the vehicles 
threaten the fragile ecosystem 
us district judge david s nelson ruled that offroad vehicle 
driving on cape cods northern beaches is an appropriate public 
use and does not adversely affect the seashores natural 
scenic and aesthetic values 
the conservation law foundation massachusetts audubon society 
and the sierra club which sued over dune buggy use in 1981 
appealed the decision to the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
the conservationists contend that vehicles threaten shore bird 
nesting and the tender vegetation that stems erosion of the dunes 
they also say vehicles destroy the natural beauty and interfere 
with other beachgoers 
but nelson said in a ruling signed late last month that dune 
nesting and beach aesthetics are unaffected by the vehicles and 
that conflicts between drivers and other beach users are minimal 
under amended rules issued in 1985 vehicles are limited to the 
eightmile stretch from hatches harbor to high head in truro 
winter driving is prohibited and the beach is closed when tides 
beach configurations or bird nesting make the route impassable 
just one of the seashores six public beaches race point is 
open to drivers who must get a permit have their vehicle 
inspected and watch a videotape on ecology the seashore issues 
about 2000 permits a year cape cod national seashore chief ranger 
tony bonanno said friday 
all dune areas are off limits except a few tracts with deeded 
access rights 
the ruling reinforces the fact that we have taken the 
appropriate steps to meet the natural resource objectives and meet 
the public interest cape cod national seashore chief ranger tony 
bonanno said friday 
the cape cod national seashore created by the 1961 federal 
seashore act enacted a resource management plan in august 1981 to 
control increasing numbers of beachgoers and wheeled vehicles the 
three conservation groups sued the day the plan took effect 
the original plan allowed vehicles on 12 miles of beach from 
april to november and on a 25mile stretch in eastham in winter 
after an order from nelson the plan was amended in 1985 
the court is basically saying yes the 85 plan is a 
resonable plan it addresses adequately the balance of different 
uses accommodates all visitors to the seashore and protects its 
resources bonanno said 
conservationists say offroad vehicle use is prohibited under 
the seashore act which bans action that would be incompatible 
with the preservation of the unique flora and fauna or the 
physiographic conditions now prevailing 
but the act permits recreational development for activities 
such as fishing camping and sailing that is environmentally 
compatible and appropriate to the beach the government can 
ban offroad vehicle use if found to have adverse effects on soil 
vegetation or wildlife habitats 
the law foundation said policing drivers is difficult that even 
small incursions on tender dune grass are harmful and that the 
seashore has handed over onefifth of the beach to drivers who 
comprise just 3 percent of its 6 million annual users 
the law did not envision the rampant offroad vehicle use that 
has gone on since the seashore was created foundation staff 
scientist paul hauge said friday 
bonanno said rangers last year filed 236 reports of dune buggy 
violations issuing about 100 fines of 50 and 100 warnings 
seashore officials said most beach drivers are fishermen needing 
access to the tip of race point 
a national park service survey found that only a small 
percentage of seashore visitors opposed vehicle use or said they 
were displaced by it

fifteen residents of the bethel 
childrens home were placed in state custody when a judge found 
they had been subjected to abuse from a director who has said he 
relies on paddlings and exercise to reform 
a 16th child was released to parents 
youth court judge robert oswald ruled thursday 11 of the 
children had been abused three abused and neglected and one 
neglected 
oswalds rulings were the latest action in a feud between the 
state and the homes founder the rev herman fountain 
fountain claims the first amendment and its separation of church 
and state shield bethel from state intervention state welfare 
commissioner thomas brittain wants to use the case to persuade the 
legislature to require the registration or licensing of religious 
boarding homes 
mississippi is one of five states that has no such law 
the 16 children were among 72 oswald ordered removed from the 
home in june that followed his decision that a 14yearold runaway 
had been abused and neglected 
an unknown number of residents fled when officials arrived at 
the home june 10 fountain has told the media he had about 120 
children at the home most from out of state but he has refused to 
comply with a court order to provide a list of their names about 
50 children havent been accounted for 
fountain who has said he uses licks with a switch or exercise 
to control and reform children and two of his assistants are being 
fined 500 each per day for refusing to answer questions in court 
two days of hearings were held this week concerning discipline 
and care of the 16 children most of the other children already 
have been released to their parents or guardians 
state officials contend some of the practices at the 10yearold 
institution constitute abuse and that children have been medically 
neglected while at bethel 
youth court hearings are normally closed to the news media but 
oswald opened the hearings on the condition the children not be 
identified

the teamsters turned friday to one of its 
old guard leaders william j mccarthy to head the besieged 
union narrowly rejecting the imageconscious heir designate of the 
late jackie presser 
the unions 17member general executive board elected mccarthy 
69 of boston by a onevote margin over secretarytreasurer weldon 
mathis to fill out the last three years of pressers term as the 
teamsters president 
presser who died a week ago had appointed mathis 62 of 
atlanta in may as acting president of the 16millionmember 
union the appointment was to last for 120 days and was made just 
before presser underwent brain surgery for cancer 
mathis remains the unions secretarytreasurer in the wake of 
the boards decision friday 
the turnover in the top post of the nations largest union one 
in every 75 working americans is a teamster occurs just two weeks 
after the justice department filed suit to seize control of its 
affairs claiming the unions leadership has been controlled by 
organized crime for more than 30 years 
mccarthy led a a rump movement among teamster vice presidents 
against a new nationwide trucking contract signed in may covering 
some 200000 union members mccarthy indicated friday he now will 
try to reopen the pact 
i dont know what i can do but i plan to do everything i can 
to improve on it and get the wishes of our membership he said at 
a news conference following his election 
the contract was declared ratified even though 64 percent of 
the affected members who voted opposed it rejection requires a 
twothirds vote under the unions constitution 
mccarthy who has presided over the 8000member teamsters local 
25 in charlestown mass for 33 years and headed the international 
unions operations in new england for two decades declined to 
discuss his power struggle with mathis 
thats not the issue he said i got enough votes to 
become the president the great strength of this board is that we 
will argue and fight about an issue but when the majority vote is 
taken everyone stands behind the decision 
asked by a reporter what presser would have thought about his 
election mccarthy confirmed his reputation for a quick temper 
who knows maybe he would roll over in his grave mccarthy 
replied i dont know what he was thinking why dont you try to 
locate him thats a goofy question ill give you a goofy answer 
the boards exact vote was not announced but several sources 
all speaking on condition of anonymity said mccarthy won by a 98 
count 
supporters of mathis tried several maneuvers to thwart 
mccarthys ascension including postponing the decision until a 
special convention of 2000 teamster representatives could be 
assembled but their various proposals were all rejected by the 
same 1vote margin 
at least two union vice presidents the board consists of 16 
vice presidents and mathis objected to declaring the vote for 
mccarthy unanimous a teamster tradition when the mantle is passed 
from one president to another one source said 
two years from now youre going to start seeing people 
campaigning like crazy he said referring to the unions next 
international convention in the spring of 1991 
both mccarthy and mathis are viewed by leaders of other labor 
unions as being clean with no major ties to organized crime 
figures in contrast to the ties that the government alleges that 
presser and former teamster presidents roy williams and jimmy hoffa 
had mathis was seen in addition as more imageoriented mathis 
helped presser orchestrate several public relations campaigns in 
recent years and helped open the union to women and other groups 
in an attempt to expand the membership base in the wake of problems 
generated by trucking deregulation 
like all of the teamster vice presidents mccarthy was named a 
defendant in the federal suit to take over the union but his name 
surfaced only once in the 200 pages of documents the government 
filed two weeks ago to support its case 
in a transcript of an fbiwiretapped conversation on may 9 
1984 convicted new york crime boss anthony salerno is quoted as 
recognizing mccarthys name as the teamsters head boss of the 
east coast this guy 
with the governments unprecedented attempt to take over the 
union mccarthy said friday he has a tough job ahead it should 
be condolences not congratulations 
but he said he is confident the teamsters will eventually win 
the case when it goes to trial before us district court judge 
david edelstein in new york 
theres a lot of insinuations and allegations made he said 
but if the judge hears our side i feel we will come out just 
as clear as we were and have been

a conference on the holocaust on friday accused 
christian churches of centuries of antijewish teaching and one 
us expert said the tradition helps explain why nazi genocide went 
unchecked in christian germany 
the failure of european civilization to stem the tide of evil 
during the holocaust makes it critically important to counteract 
historical and traditional christian antijewish teaching said a 
statement issued by the international conference 
the statement concluded a weeklong gathering of 500 academics 
concentration camp survivors theologians and teachers the 
conference met in the university town of oxford before moving to 
london on friday 
christian churchmen including britains roman catholic cardinal 
basil hume joined in prayers for the nazis 6 million jewish 
victims and conference organizers read out messages from leaders 
of the united states france britain israel and the european 
economic community 
west german chancellor helmut kohl received a standing ovation 
for a message in which he acknowledged german responsibility for 
the holocaust and said we germans are prepared to live with this 
terrible truth 
president ronald reagan said the words never again must 
ever be the pledge of all who pause in remembrance of those who 
have perished 
a major theme of the conference was how christians allowed the 
world war ii slaughter of jews to happen 
delegates focused on longtime christian church teachings that 
the jews were responsible for the murder of jesus christ and were 
condemned to wander without a homeland most churches have since 
stopped espousing this belief including the catholic church in 
1965 
the rev franklin littel an american methodist minister and a 
leading academic expert on the holocaust said that despite an 
acute rise in sensitivity by christian churches toward jews in 
the past 25 years the problem remains 
why do you suppose the liberal protestant churches find it so 
hard to come to terms with israel asked littel a former 
professor of religion at temple university in philadelphia and at 
the hebrew university in jerusalem 
it is because they are used to teaching that the jew is a 
loser littel said in an interview theyve been teaching for 
centuries that he is supposed to wander supposed to be miserable 
littel said that in 1936 germanys catholic bishops 
courageously protested the persecution of jews 
but he said the nazi response was what are you complaining 
about were just doing what your churches have been teaching 
about all along 
the anglican bishop of oxford the rt rev richard harris said 
christians had to examine how it is that at the heart of a 
socalled christian civilization such unspeakable atrocities could 
be perpetrated 
harris heads an anglican committee which will submit a new 
policy document on the churchs relations with jews to the lambeth 
conference an international gathering of anglican bishops opening 
monday 
several participants at the conference paid tribute to 
christians who helped jews during the holocaust 
historian yehuda bauer noted that 24 british doctors only one 
of whom was a jew went to treat those being liberated from 
auschwitz concentration camp many of the prisoners were known to 
have typhoid and none of the doctors who volunteered had received 
immunizations as a result many of them died 
the conference was sponsored by publisher robert maxwell 65 a 
czechoslovakborn jew who fled to britain as a teenager and his 
french protestant wife elisabeth 
maxwell asked delegates to stand and applaud after reading out 
kohls message 
germans became guilty of that crime the holocaust as 
individuals but they are collectively liable for the injustice 
committed in their name kohl a catholic said in his message 
no one can rule out the possiblity of comparable atrodcities 
happening again kohls message added it must not be 
forgotten

twentythree senators and nine house members 
on friday called for an immediate end to the state departments 
suspension of refugee processing which has left thousands of 
prospective immigrants to the united states temporarily stranded in 
the soviet union 
the senators told president reagan in a letter this decision 
sends a terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the 
world and could give the soviets the opportunity to claim that it 
is america and not the soviet union which is impeding emigration 
the house members all members of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on refugees asked secretary of state george p shultz 
either to find the estimated 10 million required to resume refugee 
processing at the us embassy in moscow or to ask congress for 
additional funds 
the suspension went into effect on july 4 and is scheduled to 
last until oct1 
it came after a sudden surge in the number of visa applications 
by soviet citizens mostly armenians and jews and after the reagan 
administration had increased the annual number of refugees the 
united states would accomodate 
the soviet union relaxed emigration policies recently and in 
june the us embassy issued some 2000 refugee visas more than 
the total approved for all of the 1987 fiscal year which began oct 
1 1986 
in light of the promises this country has made to welcome and 
resettle thousands of emigres from the soviet union the suspension 
should be lifted immediately the house members told shultz in a 
letter 
they said the suspension will result in the forced 
displacement of many families who have already lost their homes and 
their jobs and who in many cases have made long journeys to 
moscow to begin refugee processing 
after urging the soviets to open the gate of emigration it is 
important that we find this funding for refugee assistance the 
letter said to do otherwise could leave thousands of people in a 
state of uncertainty and desperation and send a disturbing signal 
that the united states is unwilling to back up its commitment to 
accomodate those seeking refuge 
rep charles e schumer dny who initiated the house letter 
said his attention was drawn to the situation when a couple with 
four children he been attempting to help leave the soviet union 
were told the moscow embassy could not process their applications 
for three months 
schumer said two members of the family of zoltan and pepa 
forkosh are sick and two are infants 
he said they had traveled to moscow from the ukraine have been 
compelled to move into an expensive apartment and are rapidly using 
up their funds 
other signers of the house letter were reps patrick l

a complex protein produced in a nasal gland 
has been identified by researchers as the chemical messenger that 
carries aromas to the odorsensing nerves of the nose 
dr solomon snyder of johns hopkins university school of 
medicine in baltimore said friday he and three other researchers 
have cloned the gene that gives instructions for the creation of 
the protein and may one day be able to use the protein to sharpen 
the sense of smell 
the protein called the odorant binding protein or obp is 
secreted by the lateral nasal gland and then carried by a duct to 
the tip of the nose snyder said when air is inhaled the obp is 
sprayed as fine mist into the air that flows into the nose he said 
snyder said the protein binds with airborne molecules as they 
are inhaled and is then carried past a nerve bundle that picks up 
the chemical message of the odor 
the nerve endings are way back high in the nose snyder 
said in a telephone interview only a small portion of the nose 
has these receptors 
when the obp comes in contact with the receptors the nerves 
interpret the chemistry of the obp as a particular smell 
snyder said the precise mechanism of how the nerves can 
distinguish between different smells such as sweet and sour is 
not yet understood he said what is detected as a fragrance may 
actually be caused by the chemical reaction of the obp mixed with 
the fragrance molecule 
by cloning the gene that produces the obp snyder said his team 
should be able to produce large quantities of the protein and 
conduct further studies into the sense of smell one of the least 
understood of the senses 
use of obp may be of medical significance in restoring lost 
appetite or helping patients who have totally lost the sense of 
smell 
this could help the elderly regain their appetite said 
snyder as people age they lose their sense of smell and this 
often is the reason that older people stop eating as they should 
by spraying obp into the nose he said it may help restore some 
of the sense of smell 
snyder said much more research must be conducted before 
specific clinical uses for the obp are found 
a report on the study was published friday in science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science 
others on the obp research team are jonathan pevsner also of

the lingering drought has forced organizers of 
lodis seventh annual sweet corn festival to import corn for the 
event all the way from down south 
you cant find anything homegrown right now it is coming out 
of alabama and georgia said jerry miller produce manager at a 
store in medina who obtained the corn through a cleveland food 
terminal 
in wetter years festival organizers have had to go no farther 
than bill richardsons medina county farm to get sweet corn 
but richardson has no edible sweet corn to offer this year 
richardson provided sweet corn to past festivals for free but 
this year festival organizers paid 9 each for 50 cases of 45 ears 
miller said that in a normal year he could have obtained corn 
from an ohio farmer for about half that price 
festival visitors however will still pay the 75 cents an ear 
charged last summer

clarence dickson the first black to head miamis 
police force announced his retirement friday saying the 
corruption problems that rocked the department during his 3year 
tenure are behind us now 
dickson 54 will be replaced by another black assistant chief 
perry c anderson 
a miami policeman for almost 29 years dickson became eligible 
for retirement this year and said at a news conference that he 
simply decided to take it 
this was entirely my own idea he said i felt like the 
highlights of my career i had already experienced 
dickson said he was proud of overcoming challenges such as the 
corruption problems in the department that is behind us now 
the softspoken chief inherited a department that had doubled to 
almost 1100 officers many poorly trained after the 1980 
liberty city riots and the mariel boatlift 
under his tenure about 100 officers were charged with crimes or 
punished administratively including those convicted in the river 
cops case that grew out of a deadly cocaine ripoff ring run by 
officers on the midnight shift 
but in addition to the successful actions against rogue cops 
there were lingering embarrassments including the unsolved theft 
of 150000 from the narcotics unit 
at the news conference dickson took pains to say that no one 
had forced him out but afterward he blasted the miami city 
commission saying a threemember majority did not like him and 
frankly i didnt like them very much 
the city managers quick choice of perry to replace dickson who 
was a symbol to many in miamis black community was seen as an 
effort to decrease tension the chiefs departure might create

a special task force headed by agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng told president reagan on friday the 1988 
drought and abnormal heat are the worst on record at this stage of 
the season and have bitten deeply into harvests of wheat 
soybeans corn and other livestock feed grains 
while july rains have eased the dry conditions in some parts 
of the great plains and delta conditions have worsened in the 
eastern corn belt and southeast where crops are now in the critical 
growth stage the panel said in its second report to the 
president 
market prices for a number of commodities are well above 
spring levels and are highly volatile the report said some 
livestock producers faced with rising feed costs have been forced 
to liquidate herds 
the report mostly reviewed what has been said before by the 
agriculture department and other agencies and during president 
reagans tour this week in drought areas of illinois and iowa 
lyng will head a team on a threeday visit next week to 11 
droughtstricken states from tennesee to the dakotas 
as usda had reported earlier the report noted that 1988 wheat 
production is down 13 percent from last year and that the corn 
crop is expected to decline by 26 percent to 52 billion bushels 
soybean output is also projected to drop by 13 percent 
consumer food prices the task force reported are expected to 
rise an additional 1 percent this year because of the drought and 
another 2 percent in 1989 that was in line with previous usda 
estimates 
the task force said drought relief legislation has been working 
its way through congress and would provide effective disaster 
assistance if it advances unencumbered with provisions unrelated to 
the drought and meets budgetary and other guidelines

sixteen years after he was expelled from the 
soviet writers union for allegedly urging jews to emigrate russian 
songwriter alexander galich has been posthumously reinstated it 
was reported friday 
the action by the writers union amounts to a rehabilitation of 
the popular jewish bard once condemned by the official press as a 
traitor and a drunkard with a pathological lust for money 
the announcement by the official tass news agency called galich 
a talented poet songster and playwright who was unjustly 
vilified 
bureaucrats responsible for culture in the 1970s closed the 
doors to the press and the motion pictures industry before him and 
then hounded him out of the country for what they considered 
seditious writings tass said 
galichs satire about official hypocrisy the apathy of the 
soviet masses and the labor camps that dot the nation made him 
unpopular with authorities but he was a hit among the people who 
listened to his songs on tapes circulated underground and read them 
in books published abroad 
the writers union accusing galich of agitation for the 
emigration of soviet jews to israel expelled him from its ranks 
in january 1972 galich who wrote screenplays in addition to 
songs was also expelled from the soviet cinema workers union 
he left the soviet union in 1974 and died in paris three years 
later 
tass did not say when the writers union readmitted galich it 
also did not say whether he was readmitted to the film workers 
union 
since coming to power in march 1985 soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev has encouraged the rehabilitation of cultural figures 
once disgraced in official eyes 
tass noted that in recent months several literary journals have 
published poems by galich and a play he wrote 30 years ago 
subsequently banned has just premiered in moscow

former president carter declaring his services 
as a mediator unneeded said friday that the relatively minor 
differences between michael dukakis and jesse jackson could vanish 
if the two men understood each other a little bit better 
the compatability between jackson and dukakis and their 
followers are so overwhelming that the differences are relatively 
insignicant carter said in an interview with the associated 
press at the carter presidential center 
i dont think they need any mediation he said i think 
what is needed is to just have a better means of communication 
directly with one another and to get any misunderstandings resolved 
as early as possible in the convention 
jackson who sought to be named dukakis vice presidential 
candidate seemed miffed when the pick went to sen lloyd bentsen 
of texas and word got out before dukakis personally relayed the 
decison to jackson he said thursday that he had asked carter to 
act as mediator between his and dukakis camps 
however dukakis rejected that idea friday and jackson aides 
also expressed doubts about it 
carter said if any mediation is needed the role should go to 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk but that he might 
get involved if kirk asked him to however kirk also said he saw 
no role for a mediator 
the former president said he did not see ill will over the vice 
presidential choice lasting much past the convention thats one 
of the reasons for the convention to resolve differences within 
the party it is not unprecedented carter said 
when the rev jackson called me we talked about the 
procedures that i always used when i was running for president or 
when i was in the white house 
when i had a major decision to make i brought into the 
white house key leaders of the black community who were also my 
political supporters i asked them for advice and i listened very 
carefully to them there was never any doubt that in a very genuine 
way they were a part of the deliberations of my government 
carter said he thought the choice of bentsen could help dukakis 
in the south against the expected republican presidential 
candidate vice president george bush 
he described bentsen as a man who provides a philosophical 
balance to the ticket and who has had a lot to do with minority 
problems with spanish and blacks in texas and i think hes 
wellrespected in the south 
carter said he plans no major role for himself at the convention 
or during the campaign he is to address the convention monday 
night 
if during the campaign incorrect statements are made about 
events to which he was a party or has special knowledge carter 
said i will reserve the right to set the record straight

the city should demolish most if not all of its 
168 public housing highrise buildings for families and find new 
homes for the 70000 tenants a report by a mayors advisory group 
recommends 
contents of the report completed in may and submitted to mayor 
eugene sawyer more than a month ago have not been made public 
officially but they were outlined in fridays editions of the 
chicago tribune 
the report doesnt recommend tearing down any housing until 
adequate housing is available philip klutznick cochairman of 
the 25member panel said by telephone friday he declined to 
discuss the report further 
a spokeswoman for the mayor said friday that sawyer planned to 
release details of the report by the mayors advisory council on 
the chicago housing authority later this month 
the councils recommendation to raze family highrises 
represents the strongest and most official endorsement of a 
politically sensitive concept that has been discussed for many 
years the newspaper said 
the panels call for gradual elimination of the family 
highrises is based the newspaper said on problems common in 
public housing in chicago and other cities a rapidly 
deteriorating housing stock a lack of funding to make necessary 
repairs and the worsening of social problems that occur by crowding 
large numbers of poor families together 
edward marciniak a loyola university urban studies professor 
who published a 1986 book advocating replacement of highrises 
said public housing residents should be relocated throughout the 
metropolitan area 
people have blinders when they think we can solve the 
challenge of providing safe sanitary decent housing in the city 
itself said marciniak who was not a member of the advisory 
panel which was established more than a year ago by the late mayor 
harold washington 
according to the councils report highrise buildings per se 
are not a problem rather the problem is the intense 
concentration of large poor primarily singleparent families in 
buildings poorly designed to support their needs 
this is further compounded by the concentration of such 
buildings in close proximity to each other while being racially and 
economically segregated and isolated from viable neighborhoods 
the report said 
worsening conditions at the citys public housing developments 
are mainly due to a 76 percent drop in federal funding for housing 
programs nationally over the last eight years the council said 
it said the cost of replacing 800 cha units a year would be 20 
million to 48 million but contended this would be cheaper than 
trying to rehabilitate many of the highrises 
funds raised through the sale of cha properties could be used to 
buy buildings or construct them the report said in addition it 
suggested that another source of money would be federal funds now 
earmarked for rebuilding the highrises

republican national convention officials said 
friday their 15 million makeover of the louisiana superdome is 
already about 20 percent complete just five days after they took 
over the massive arena to prepare for next months convention 
we are on schedule or ahead of schedule on every phase 
convention manager bill phillips told reporters during a guided 
tour of the dome 
work was being done on the framework of a huge 570000 podium 
from which president reagan vice president bush and other 
dignitaries will adress the 31000 people expected to attend the 
convention which runs aug 1518 
phillips said the republican party is spending about 9 million 
on the convention the city of new orleans is raising about 55 
million through private contributions to pay for the sound and 
light systems and other projects 
basically were looking at a 15 million operation 
phillips said 
best known as an indoor football stadium the dome is looking 
less and less like the home of the new orleans saints and more and 
more like a media center 
four television networks will have tall multilevel booths near 
the podium carpenters and electricians worked to convert suites 
known as skyboxes which overlook the floor from the perimeter of 
the stadium into broadcast booths for other radio and television 
broadcasters 
arising on either side of the podium was the framework for the 
structures from which print journalists will observe the 
proceedings 
still to come is the hanging of the ninestory high threeton 
blue curtain that will serve as a room divider for the dome public 
convention business will be conducted for the cameras on one side 
while trailers used as offices will be driven onto the floor 
behind the curtains 
phillips said construction should be completed by aug 10 
giving convention officials plenty of time to run tests on 
equipment before the convention begins 
once the convention ends the construction work begins again 
in reverse the republicans agreement with the superdome calls for 
the stadium to be restored to its original condition by aug 25

michael dukakis said friday he doesnt need a mediator to settle 
his preconvention differences with jesse jackson and his 
democratic rival acknowleged we can only win with each other 
the two men talked by telephone and agreed to have their top 
aides meet in atlanta saturday night as they edged away from a 
confrontation that threatened to disturb the peace at the partys 
convention 
i want him involved i want his staff people involved said 
dukakis whose nomination is assured at the same time he curtly 
rejected his rivals call to have former president carter mediate 
their disagreements we dont need mediators he said in an 
interview in the massachusetts statehouse 
carter in an interview in atlanta also said his services as a 
mediator were unneeded he called for better communication and 
suggested relatively minor differences between dukakis and jackson 
could vanish if the two men understood each other a little bit 
better 
the latest democratic developments came as vice president george 
bush was ready to hang a gone fishing sign on his door in 
washington aides said he would spend the next several days in 
wyoming with treasury secretary james baker who is expected to 
resign his cabinet post shortly to join his old friends campaign 
for the white house 
bushs republican surrogates set up camp behind enemy lines in 
atlanta and began stressing the policy differences between dukakis 
and his more conservative running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said that regardless of 
whom bush picks as his vice presidential candidate youre going 
to find only shades of difference in our philosphy not this chasm 
you find between dukakis on the one hand and lloyd bentsen on the 
other 
in his statehouse interview dukakis insisted that democrats are 
unified despite jacksons prodding on platform issues and jackson 
supporters complaints about the selection of texas sen lloyd 
bentsen as running mate 
i cant remember a time when weve the democrats been more 
together he said 
he said he thought the party reflected a broad national 
consensus on such issues as trade plant closing health care and 
the environment 
i think thats the reason you just dont have these deep 
ideological divisions that you often have had in the past 
jacksons convention manager ron brown said the two sides had 
already smoothed out most of their differences on the democratic 
platform before jackson called a halt to the formal negotiations 
if the talks resume brown said in an interview in atlanta 
wed be close to signing off on it 
jackson called a news conference in louisville ky as his bus 
caravan wound southward toward the convention city 
we simply cannot win without each other we can only win with 
each other he said of himself and dukakis 
it is in our distinct advantage to find common ground 
given the creative tension in the past few days taking a 
diplomatic initiative to get more people involved is the right 
thing to do jackson said of the meetings of top aides set for 
the weekend 
he refused to say whether he would challenge bentsens vice 
presidential nomination and dukakis said he didnt know what would 
happen on that score 
for his part dukakis refused to disclose the nature of his 
conversation with jackson but he ruled out his rivals idea to 
have former president carter play mediator in their preconvention 
disagreements 
carter also said he didnt think his services were needed 
i dont think they need any mediation i think what is needed 
is to just have a better means of communication between one 
another he added in an interview 
even before they made their comments the idea seemed to be 
going nowhere 
i dont think in my view that the fact that there has been 
some miscommunication at this point requires the president of the 
united states to come to the table party chairman paul kirk told 
cbs in an interview 
a top jackson aide also cast doubt on the idea and bert lance 
a confidant of both the former president and jackson did as well 
mike and jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with 
he said 
the democratic convention city was beginning to fill up with 
delegates and three out of every four belonged to dukakis 
the few remaining uncommitted officials seemed headed toward 
dukakis camp virginia gov gerald l baliles for one announced 
his support in richmond 
dukakis spent time in his statehouse office in boston grappling 
with budget difficulties for the current fiscal year and the one 
just ended he is expected to travel to atlanta on sunday and will 
be nominated for president three nights later 
in conversations with reporters jackson said he would meet with 
dukakis at an appropriate time he broke off negotiations on 
the platform earlier in the week after learning of bentsens 
selection as the democratic vice presidential candidate from a 
reporter rather than from dukakis 
he also said carter could help mediate at the appropriate 
time but his top aide ron brown seemed to back away from the 
idea brown said that any role for carter was not clear yet 
even before the democrats formally convened republicans were 
working on their own convention set to begin in new orleans on 
aug 15 
the city won preliminary approval from the states bond 
commission to borrow up to 30 million to help pay its share of 
convention costs

attorneys for former navy secretary john f 
lehman jr asked a federal judge on friday to dismiss a lawsuit 
filed by an executive of a defense contracting company who says he 
lost his job after publicly criticizing government spending 
other defendants in the lawsuit are lehmans onetime deputies 
defense consultant melvyn r paisley and assistant navy secretary 
everett pyatt and carl smith a staffer with the senate armed 
services committee 
in the lawsuit lawrence j korb claims officials at raytheon 
co removed him from his position as vice president in the nations 
capital after they received complaints from paisley and pyatt about 
korbs public statements 
korb who joined raytheon in 1985 participated in a press 
conference in february 1986 at which he suggested the pentagon 
could maintain a strong force with a smaller budget 
after that paisley and pyatt called korbs superiors 
suggesting they tell the former pentagon official to stop speaking 
out against the presidents budget 
the pentagons inspector general concluded in a report released 
in november 1986 that while lehman did not direct pyatt and paisley 
to called raytheon he erred in condoning their actions 
the report said the three thennavy officials were wrong in 
complaining to raytheon with the intention of restricting dr 
korb from making public statements 
but lehmans attorney robert bennett told us district judge 
claude hilton that there is simply no case against lehman the 
calls were made by two of his assistant secretaries 
moreover he said navy officials have every right to express 
their views to defense contractors 
but kate martin korbs attorney said that what these people 
were doing was wrong putting pressure on dr korb to keep 
quiet 
martin works for the american civil liberties union which is 
representing korb in his lawsuit in which he seeks 500000 in 
damages korb is now associated with the brookings institution a 
liberal think tank 
hilton said he would rule shortly on whether to dismiss the 
lawsuit 
the lawsuit is not related to the massive investigation into 
defense procurement practices paisley is a key figure in that 
probe which centers on allegations that consultants paid bribes to 
pentagon officials to obtain classified information used to clinch 
multimilliondollar contracts

president reagan said friday the united 
nations must make further progress on reform to satisfy 
concerns that have prompted the united states to withhold dues from 
the world organization 
reagans remarks to un secretary general perez de cuellar were 
relayed to reporters by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
after a meeting between the two officials 
the united states has withheld about 44 million in current 
contributions to the united nations because of objections to its 
budget and personnel procedures 
the president said that the us recognizes its obligations to 
the un but that further progress on reform was necessary to meet 
the concerns of congress which the administration shares 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater said that reagan hopes the problem of overdue us 
contributions to the world organization can be worked out 
the white house spokesman listed three areas in which the united 
states desires un reforms the un budgetmaking process the 
need for a 15 percent cut in un personnel and the practice of 
shortterm contracting of soviet un employees so that they remain 
under their governments control instead of becoming un career 
employees 
perez de cuellar warned last last month that un budget arrears 
of 691 million including 467 million run up by the united 
states would leave the organization out of money with all its 
reserves exhausted by late october or early november he was 
expected to warn reagan that the united nations might be unable to 
meet its payroll or other obligations 
the secretary general was concerned that we have not been 
forthcoming with our share fitzwater said 
the 44 million was an amount the reagan administration sought 
to pay last year but congress held up until reagan certified 
progress on reforming the un budget decisionmaking process and 
the two other areas of concern 
richard s williamson us assistant secretary of state for 
international organizations has described overall progress on un 
reforms as encouraging but suggested the demands of congress have 
not yet been fully met on the budgetdecision making process 
posing for photographs with perez de cuellar reagan 
acknowledged to reporters that recently there has been some 
problem again with the congress on this 
as the richest un member the united states is earmarked for 
25 percent of the un general budget it has pressed for more 
weighted voting by the major financial contributors on the un 
budget 
fitzwater said reagan praised the secretary general for the un 
role in the geneva accords on afghanistan saying that without un 
participation the agreement would not have been possible 
perez de cuellar said the international organization would 
continue to be active in afghan refugee resettlement the soviet 
union and the afghan government in kabul have been accusing 
pakistan and the united states of violating the accord with 
continuing help for the antisoviet guerrillas 
fitzwater said reagan expressed regret over the shooting down of 
an iranian airliner by the us cruiser vincennes and thanked perez 
de cuellar for his efforts to implement the yeaold security 
council resolution cutting off arms supplies to iran and iraq in 
the persian gulf war 
the president stressed the importance of the growing un role 
in controlling international production and trafficking of illicit 
drugs the spokesman said 
the united nations certainly can be influential in urging 
other countries to take action in helping us with our initiatives 
to eliminate narcotics crops and in enforcement measures against 
drug traffic fitzwater told reporters 
perez de cuellar flew back to new york after the white house 
meeting without speaking to reporters

food shortages and illnesses caused by stress are 
plaguing armenians living in a disputed region trying to break away 
from azerbaijan a resident and the staterun media reported friday 
one resident a journalist with the state broadcasting 
authority claimed azerbaijani authorities were preventing food 
from getting to the region nagornokarabakh 
we are under a virtual economic blockade said the 
journalist the azerbaijanis are trying to morally kill our 
movement to strike down our just demands 
the official news agency tass however blamed the supply 
problems in nagornokarabakh on a nearly 2monthold strike tass 
said more than 130 freight cars and more than 300 containers of 
food have backed up at the railway station in stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs main city 
there are no more fruits or vegetables in our shops said

religious discrimination by the azerbaijan government

of the region given to predominantly moslem azerbaijan in 1923 be 
transferred to the neighboring republic of armenia 
in february 32 people were killed in ethnic riots in sumgait

the azerbaijanis the journalist added have suspended bus 
service between stepanakert and the armenian cities of kirovakan

nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann 
reluctantly yielded friday to a reagan administration demand that 
he leave the country departing five minutes ahead of the deadline 
imposed by the state department 
but he took a parting shot at the administration insisting that 
the us action threatened the independence of the organization of 
american states and saying his leftist government would seek 
recourse through oas legal channels 
speaking at a crowded embassy news conference shortly before 
leaving for the airport tunnermann said defiance of the expulsion 
order could give the reagan administration an excuse to continue 
its aggression against our people 
tunnermann and seven embassy colleagues were notified of the 
expulsion on tuesday and were given until 530 pm edt friday to 
leave the country they flew to mexico city via houston on a 525 
pm flight and planned to go to managua on saturday 
about a dozen police officers were stationed at the continental 
airlines planes gate at washington national airport two police 
vehicles followed the jet out onto the taxiway then pulled out to 
the head of the runway and waited for it to take off 
tunnermanns wife rosa who accompanied the envoy to news 
conference said she and seven of the couples children plan to 
remain in the washington area 
the state department acted after eight american diplomats 
including ambassador richard melton were ordered home by the 
nicaraguan government on monday for alleged interference in the 
countrys internal affairs 
the administration described the us response as retaliatory 
and said that in the case of tunnermann and nicaraguas military 
attache major pedro sampson the expulsion was also based on 
abuses of their privilege of residence 
tunnermann served as both ambassador to the united states and 
the oas and maintained throughout that the united states had no 
right to expel him citing guarantees contained in the oas charter 
the charter states that attendance at oas meetings shall not 
depend on bilateral relations between any member state and the 
united states which is host country for the oas 
but the administration said a separate agreement between the 
united states and the oas authorizes the us government to order 
any oas diplomat home 
tunnermann repeatedly challenged us officials to present 
evidence of the wrongdoing he and sampson were alleged to have 
engaged in the administration has steadfastly refused saying it 
was under no obligation to provide details 
on thursday the us ambassador to the oas richard mccormack 
said the administration had deferred expelling tunnermann and 
sampson earlier in order to avoid giving the nicaraguan government 
a pretext for ordering home us diplomats 
he added that the expulsion of the eight americans this week 
removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the united 
states 
tunnermann took his case to the oas permanent council on 
thursday but received little more than a polite hearing from most 
of his 31 colleagues there 
a statement issued in the name of seven latin american 
governments acknowledged that the rights of ambassadors against 
arbitrary expulsion are not adequately protected and said it is 
necessary to fill this legal vacuum 
tunnermann who spent 3 years here said the united states 
should not have veto power over oas appointees and that 
nicaragua would take action to defend the rights of ambassadors to 
immunity 
sofia clark an embassy counselor read a statement at the news 
conference in which she said the united states had set a 
dangerous precedent that threatened the independence of the oas 
had tunnermann chosen to remain in defiance of the order he 
apparently would have been considered as an illegal alien even 
though us law protects such aliens against summary expulsion and 
guarantees them a hearing tunnermann elected to leave the country 
he said however that he still considers himself to be nicaraguas 
ambassador 
shortly before the news conference president reagan said he 
expected tunnermann to observe comply with the expulsion order by 
the deadline 
asked what the us government would do if tunnermann defied the 
deadline reagan told reporters were expecting him to leave at 
that hour beyond that hour he is here illegally 
i dont know where hell hide the president said 
indicating the government would enforce its expulsion order if 
necessary hes illegally here beyond that period of time we 
expect him to be going to the airport or to leave

gov michael s dukakis defended his use of taxes 
and borrowing to cover a state budget shortfall as he awaited final 
legislative action on the plan before heading to the democratic 
convention 
in an interview friday with the associated press in his 
statehouse office dukakis rejected any comparisons between his 
borrowing and the federal deficit spending of the reagan 
administration 
obviously were not going to do anything around here that 
jeopardizes our credit rating if all goes well well come out of 
this with some endofyear surplus dukakis predicted 
he also defended his recent signing of a 24 million sales tax 
on cigarettes on the grounds that it would pay for the first year 
phasein of his universal health care plan 
if we didnt have the health care bill we wouldnt have 
needed that frankly i think thats a modest price to pay for the 
first universal health care bill in the history of this country 
the governor said 
he acknowledged however that the cigarette tax would not pay 
for universal health insurance in later years when the program 
becomes more expensive he did not address himself to the other 
revenue measures proposed to shore up next years state budget 
dukakis did show a willingness to tangle with george bush if the 
expected republican presidential nominee accuses him of being a 
taxraiser 
let em do it said dukakis who recently accused bush of 
violating a nonewtaxes pledge by supporting a federal 
catastrophic illness health care bill that calls for 6 billion in 
new revenues 
i havent heard much the last week or two from the vice 
president on the subject since his notax pledge has disappeared 
and i dont think youre going to hear much dukakis said 
as he spoke friday afternoon an 1175 billion budget for the 
current fiscal year was awaiting his signature dukakis said he 
would use his lineitem veto to reduce the total but he would not 
say how 
at the same time dukakis is awaiting a package of bills 
designed to close a deficit in last years budget that ranges from 
the administrations estimate of 370 million to as much as 470 
million projected by some legislators 
dukakis has proposed closing the budget gap through converting 
some 200 million in operating expenses into longterm bonds 
tapping a 27 million pension system surplus and diverting 50 
million in surplus lottery proceeds from local government 
in addition to shore up next years budget the governor is 
seeking to raise more than 200 million by closing corporate tax 
loopholes recoupling the state income tax with federal law 
and collecting unclaimed bottle deposits 
the governor traced his budget problems to an unanticipated 
and he says unforeseeble downturn in state tax collections this 
spring 
remember this he said the revenue advisory board as 
recently as three months ago gave us a revised report which 
forecast a 70 million shortfall for fy88 and a 40 million 
shortfall for fy89 
now if that revised forecast had been accurate it would have 
been like a day at the beach dukakis said 
according to the governor he and legislative leaders made a 
decision last year to take advantage of the nowevaporated state 
budget surplus by paying cash for some highway and building repair 
projects that normally would have been funded through bonds 
now faced with a shortfall dukakis said he is simply shifting 
the funds back into a category where they belonged all along

in a new reaction to the ongoing pentagon 
fraud investigation the defense department announced friday it is 
requiring special procedures for future contracts with 16 
defense firms 
the procedures will include a certification that none of the 
companies improperly obtained inside information relating to 
contracts the pentagon said 
the contractors also will be required to include a clause in 
contracts permitting the government to recapture profits if it is 
later determined the company won the contract through illegal or 
improper activity the pentagon said 
the announcement results from the investigation into allegations 
that private defense consultants many of whom are former military 
or pentagon officials paid bribes to current pentagon employees 
for inside information about contracts 
that information could be crucial in winning contracts worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars no charges have yet been filed in 
the twoyearold case which became public a month ago when search 
warrants were served across the country on a number of contractors 
and consultants 
the pentagon announcement said the procedures will affect future 
contracts worth more than 100000 and is an interim measure 
designed to protect the governments interests 
the defense department said the list of 16 companies could be 
expanded as additional information becomes available 
the pentagon said it was acting because the contractors or 
their subsidiaries either were the subject of search warrants in 
connection with the ongoing procurement investigation or other 
official information currently available that requires 
certification of business integrity prior to awarding of future 
contracts 
the list includes some of the nations largest defense 
contractors including mcdonnell douglas northrop unisys 
teledyne electronics and united technologies 
two weeks ago defense secretary frank c carlucci announced he 
was suspending contracts in nine military programs worth 1 billion 
because of the possibility they may have been tainted he said he 
was acting on the basis of information contained in an affidavit 
unsealed by a federal court in dallas 
carlucci rescinded that action monday and told congress a review 
of the contracts had found no problems with the pacts 
but he also said action should be taken as a warning to 
contractors that the pentagon would act if questions were raised 
about future contracts 
carlucci and other pentagon officials have said the pentagon has 
the legal authority to recoup profits if the money turns out to 
have been earned through some illegality but members of congress 
have been pushing for inclusion of a separate clause in future 
contracts to spell out that right more clearly 
the firms affected by fridays announcement include armtec inc 
palatka fla cubic corp san diego calif emhart corp 
hartford conn executive resource associates arlington va 
hazeltine corp commack ny kane paper corp baldwin ny 
litton data systems van nuys calif loral aircraft akron ohio

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev spent 
friday in closed meetings with other warsaw pact leaders and his 
wife raisa visited auschwitz where 4 million people were killed in 
nazi death camps 
gorbachevs proposals for new efforts to break a deadlock with 
nato over reducing conventional forces in europe already rejected 
by the united states were among the topics for discussion in the 
first of two days of private talks 
a brief official report of the proceedings said gorbachev and 
the other leaders addressed the openingday session but gave no 
details they met in the council of ministers palace where the 
treaty of warsaw was signed in 1955 to formalize the political and 
military alliance 
the official news agency pap later reported dinner toasts by 
nicolae ceausescu of romania and polish leader wojciech jaruzelski 
ceausescu called for talks aimed at eliminating shortrange 
nuclear missiles in europe those with ranges up to 300 miles 
which are not included in the ussoviet treaty to scrap 
mediumrange weapons the agency said 
jaruzelski said gorbachevs proposals for talks on reducing 
conventional forces were valuable original initiatives and 
were discussed in the first days session 
mrs gorbachev returned to southern poland which the gorbachevs 
visited earlier in the week to memorialize those who died during 
world war ii in the auschwitzbirkenau extermination camp 
she laid bouquets of red carnations at execution wall and at the 
russianlanguage tablet that is part of an international monument 
to the dead 
wiping a tear from her cheek mrs gorbachev said after touring 
the camp that almost 50 years since the beginning of world war ii 
the camp still reminds the living of the hope human fear and 
bravery of its inmates 
it should remind us all that what is most precious in this 
world is the right to live and be free she said in brief remarks 
broadcast by state television 
soviet forces liberated auschwitz built by the germans after 
they occupied poland at the beginning of the war in january 1945 
and it has been preserved as a museum the gas chambers and 
crematoria of birkenau were largely destroyed by retreating german 
forces and the site is marked by a stone monument and tablets in 
many languages 
the combined camp was the center of hitlers effort to wipe out 
european jews millions of whom lived in poland and nazioccupied 
regions of the soviet union 
next to poles both jew and christian more than 1 million 
soviet citizens made up the largest single nationality among the 
victims soviet prisoners of war received particularly harsh 
treatment in the slavelabor sections of the complex 
news coverage of mrs gorbachevs visit the first event of the 
sixday visit to poland when she did not accompany her husband was 
restricted to soviet and polish media 
the meeting of the warsaw pacts politicalconsultative council 
is the first since the fourth gorbachevreagan summit six weeks ago 
in moscow 
it also was the soviet leaders first opportunity to brief his 
allies on the soviet unions national communist party conference at 
the end of june which reiterated his policy of encouraging 
economic and social reform 
when he arrived monday gorbachev proposed that negotiators from 
east and west meet informally to seek ways of breaking the impasse 
that for years has blocked mutual reductions of conventional forces 
in europe 
washington issued a statement saying appropriate forums already 
exist in vienna and elsewhere for discussing arms reduction and 
that any such talks should include representatives of all nato 
countries 
the us response was equally cool to gorbachevs suggestion 
that the soviet union would withdraw an unspecified number of its 
military aircraft from eastern europe if nato drops a plan to 
redeploy 72 american f16s from spain to italy

in more than a halfcentury as a teamster william 
j mccarthy learned the highways around new england and the paths 
to power and did it with a tough but lowkey style 
hes not the type to make a lot of publicity said robert 
derusha secretarytreasurer of the joint council 10 which 
represents 55000 teamsters in new england he works hard and 
cares about the union movement hes respected by everyone here 
but he keeps a low profile 
such anonymity may be difficult now for mccarthy 69 who was 
selected president of the nations largest labor union friday by 
the teamsters 17member general executive board over 
secretarytreasurer weldon mathis whom former union president 
jackie presser had named acting president may 4 presser 61 who 
died of cancer saturday had been under federal indictment on 
charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement 
mccarthy takes control of a 16 millionmember union that 
routinely makes headlines for its influence in political campaigns 
and reputed links to organized crime 
mccarthy is one of 19 present and former teamster leaders named 
defendants in a government suit trying to seize control of the 
union through a courtappointed trustee claiming its leadership is 
either controlled by organized crime figures or incapable of 
removing its influence 
among the allegations in the suit filed two weeks ago is that 
mob bosses in chicago and new york were behind the elevation of roy 
williams to the unions presidency in 1981 and supported presser in 
1983 
mccarthy who has a reputation of being a tough negotiator with 
a quick temper will serve out the remainder of pressers fiveyear 
term which expires in 1991 when the union holds its next 
international convention 
apart from the latest federal takeover suit and several 
investigations of alleged teamster misconduct in the early 1980s 
mccarthy has ruled the new england teamsters without much public 
scrutiny 
i think his reputation as a hardworking wellorganized 
leader had a lot to do with his selection said arthur osborn 
president of the massachusetts aflcio i think anyone under fire 
wants to look to turn things around they think mccarthy is the 
best person to motivate that union and move it forward 
mccarthy began his fulltime union activity in the early 1940s 
negotiating contracts and handling grievances as the youngest 
business agent ever at local 25 in bostons charlestown section 
by the mid1960s he had risen to secretarytreasurer of the new 
england joint council and was elected president four years later 
he will retain the regional post in addition to his national 
responsibilities said derusha 
upward career mobility also allowed mccarthy to move from 
charlestown to suburban arlington where he raised four children 
and lives with his wife mary 
in early 1982 mccarthy was called to testify in a 31count 
federal case against three members of teamsters local 25 accused of 
defrauding movie outfits filming in boston by arranging pay for 
absent union members 
the next year mccarthy and eight other trustees in the new 
england teamster pension fund agreed to pay 205000 as settlement 
of a us labor department suit that alleged the trustees violated 
federal regulations by allowing the funds investment advisor to 
receive commissions on real estate investments 
there are no other current labor department investigations that 
include mccarthy according to a department spokesman in boston 
roy herrick who worked with mccarthy for nearly 45 years 
believes his appointment may help stem problems at the teamsters 
hes come from the bottom to the very top and he knows what it 
is to take hard knocks and barely have enough to eat said 
herrick 70 president of the 1100member local 25 retirees 
chapter hes a hard man and a tough negotiator but hes fair 
hes a teamsters teamster thats what we need now

jackson in her keynote address at the democratic national 
convention 
richards 54 said the democrats are more unified than at any 
other time in her lifetime despite the rift that developed this 
week between the jackson and dukakis camps over dukakis failure to 
notify jackson in advance of his selection of sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas as his running mate 
what you have here are two superb leaders two bright 
individuals two of our partys best and i think that whatever 
the difficulties they will be able to resolve those she said of 
dukakis and jackson 
richards said at a news conference that she did not intend to 
focus in her monday night speech on the estrangement that jackson 
has been feeling from the dukakis campaign since the dispute over 
dukakis running mate occurred on tuesday contacts between the two 
campaigns have been initiated to discuss jacksons role in the 
democrats plans for november 
im going to talk about jesse jackson because i think hes 
been a passionate energetic and exciting voice in this country and 
i want to compliment him for that richards said 
mentioning general themes of her speech without revealing 
specifics richard said she would speak about gop nomineetobe 
george bush and the last eight years under a republican 
administration and will laud the records of dukakis bentsen and 
jackson 
she said she also would talk about the american family an 
issue popular this year with both republicans and democrats 
liberals and conservatives its something i feel like ive 
lived she said 
she noted the dramatic crowdrousing speech given by new york 
gov mario cuomo at the democratic convention four years ago and 
said the issues he talked about such as homelessness drugs and 
ghettos still are important in the country 
well known for her crowdpleasing speaking style richards said 
she did not expect to match cuomos effort 
i kind of feel like a student who is facing final exams and 
knowing that this one is important this one is tough and i had 
better be prepared for it she said so im still cramming and 
doing some finishing touches and will be ready to open the 
convention monday night 
richards has been state treasurer since 1982 and was the first 
woman elected to a statewide office in texas in 50 years when she 
assumed the post

authorities will begin moving about 
17000 cambodian refugees from the khaoidang camp to a location 
closer to the thaicambodian border a military commander said 
friday 
the united states and other countries have expressed concern 
about the refugees safety if they are moved from khaoidang whic 
is eight miles from the frontier 
thousands of cambodians have entered thailand to escape the war 
in their country between guerrilla forces and vietnamese and 
government troops vietnam sent troops into cambodia in december 
1978 ousted the radical khmer rouge regime and installed another 
communist government 
most of the cambodians settled in camps along the border and 
khaoidang is considered the only refugee camp not controlled by 
the differerent guerrilla groups it also is the only camp where 
there is an official program to resettle the refugees in other 
countries 
thailand had declared on dec 31 1986 that it would close 
khaoidang but only a small number of refugees were forced to 
leave 
col sanan kajornklam of the supreme commands joint operations 
center spoke of moving the refugees at a meeting friday 
later in an interview with the associated press sanan said 
that within three months authorities will start moving the 
khaoidang refugees to the area of site 2 close to the border 
site 2 adjoins the ban thad camp where the government trying to 
discourage more indochinese from entering thailand has placed 
about 3000 vietnamese refugees 
sanan said the khaoidang refugees would be resettled because 
they have not been accepted by other countries and they must 
prepare to return to cambodia 
if we close khaoidang the cambodians will know that they 
must go home sanan said 
kobsak chutikul director of the foreign ministrys social 
afffairs division said that in its plans to move the khaoidang 
refugees the government will follow three objectives that un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar outlined in a letter to 
the government last year 
he said those objectives are that the new site be safe that it 
be neutral and that the refugees remain under the protection of the 
office of the un high commissioner for refugees

a company accused of reneging on a drought 
insurance offer said friday it would issue an additional 10 
million in total coverage for farmers in 10 midwest states 
but one insurance official said federal insurance cos plan was 
unacceptable 
federal a subsidiary of warrenbased chubb group insurance 
cos has been accused of backing off a promise to issue policies 
that pay off if rainfall falls below a certain level 
chubb says the flood of applications in the final days of the 
enrollment period which lasted from may 1 to june 17 exceeded the 
amount of coverage it wanted to provide and that it cannot fill 
all the applications 
the company initially planned to issue 30 million but increased 
the total coverage to 40 million which will protect about 800 
farmers chubb said friday it made the decision after talking with 
insurance commissioners in the affected states 
the 6000 farmers who do not receive insurance will get twice 
the amount of their premium returned said chubb spokeswoman mary 
lu korkuch premiums already have been returned to insurance 
agents she said 
another 1000 farmers whose applications were received june 16 
or later will get only their premium back she said 
farmers arent losing money she said they just might 
not get the insurance they want 
applications for about 350 million in total coverage are not 
being accepted because they exceed the 40 million limit she said 
chubb said friday any assertion that it was bound to accept all 
applications was without merit and would be subject to a very 
vigorous defense the company said nearly all the applications 
clearly indicate that policies would be issued only after 
acceptance by the insurer 
its hogwash iowa insurance commissioner william hager said 
of that contention 
the application form we approved for use in iowa specifically 
provides that once the premium is submitted coverage is bound 
hager said 
we simply are not going to tolerate by analogy a company 
that issues a policy finds out that the building is burning and 
says whoops we really didnt mean we were going to cover the 
loss the iowa commissioner said 
iowa and ohio officials said their states are prepared to take 
legal action if necessary while minnesota will seek to revoke the 
companys state license to do business if it does not provide the 
coverage 
an estimated 450 ohio farmers applied and sent in premiums for 
the insurance said neil rector deputy director of the ohio 
department of insurance about 10 percent of them would be covered 
under chubbs proposal he said 
minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch estimates 1000 
farmers from his state applied for a total of 40 million in 
coverage 
other states whose farmers sought the coverage are indiana 
iowa illinois kentucky michigan missouri tennessee and 
wisconsin 
we increased our capacity for this program from 30 million to 
40 million in the hope that this additional coverage will provide 
help to midwestern farmers during this very difficult period 
chubb said in a written statement 
lawsuits have been filed against chubb by indiana farmers 
alleging the company acted in bad faith by reneging on the 
insurance and some farmers in tennessee and kentucky told an agent 
to send the premium refunds back to chubb and demand the coverage 
be provided 
rector said chubb has not been threatened with license 
revocation in ohio but weve told them that the departments 
position is theyre on the hook 
ms korkuch said she could not comment on the lawsuits and said 
they have not been resolved she also said she had no comment on 
what the company would do if farmers refuse to accept the refunds

an 8yearold boy who had no heartbeat and a 
body temperature of only 70 degrees after spending four hours 
trapped in a freezer died friday 21 hours after he was discovered 
by his father hospital officials said 
although medical personnel had managed to get joseph kroggs 
heart beating and return his body temperature to normal he made no 
further progress said jane yousey spokeswoman for rainbow babies 
and childrens hospital 
he was put on life support and he never regained 
consciousness ms yousey said 
when joseph arrived at st joseph hospital in lorain at 7 pm 
thursday emergency room dr stephen evans told the boys father 
dale krogg the chances of resuscitating him were one in a million 
icicles had formed on his body and his heart had stopped beating 
but doctors began an elaborate process of rewarming josephs 
body by running tubes of warm saline through his stomach and 
bladder and wrapping him in electric blankets 
about 11 pm josephs heart began to beat again and by 1 am 
friday he had a strong pulse and good blood pressure and his 
temperature returned to normal evans said 
the youth was then airlifted 35 miles to rainbow babies and 
childrens hospital in cleveland where he died at 402 pm friday 
the youth was reported missing by his parents around 5 pm 
thursday said detective sgt joe monia of the sheffield lake 
police department his father found him at 630 pm when he went 
to the freezer in the familys garage to get meat for dinner 
joseph had apparently fallen into the freezer while trying to 
reach some popsicles monia said a discarded battery had been 
pushed in front of the freezer to act as a step for the youth he 
said 
it appears he crawled up on the battery and tumbled in 
monia said the lid closed on him and latched 
because of the location of the freezer any pounding or yelling 
would not be heard by anyone the father said 
evans said doctors believed it a miracle the boy survived as 
long as he did 
while some drowning victims have revived after up to an hour in 
similar freezing conditions said evans weve never had anyone 
survive so long this is what makes it so unusual

portauprince haiti ap haitian leader lt gen henri 
namphy decreed on state television friday night what he described 
as a decentralization program aimed at helping the poor 
namphy said the national bureau of small projects coordination 
program led by a coordinator and 77 advisers is aimed at 
encouraging the poor to be the artisans of their own destiny by 
taking part in local decisionmaking 
the bureau will coordinate smallscale development projects 
such as the building of latrines wells lowerclass living 
quarters and repairing roads 
namphy ousted president leslie manigat after only four months of 
civilian rule in a coup on june 19 
his plan is highly similar to the development program manigat 
outlined in his platform calling for decentralized decisionmaking 
and selfhelp projects in the countryside 
namphy said in his 10minute speech fridaythe government has 
decided to implant a dynamic administrative structure in 
accordance with the demands of the population 
namphy added that haitis social inequalities are clearly 
unacceptable 
most haitians earn less than 300 a year each making this 
caribbean nation of 6 million the poorest in the americas haiti 
shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic 
the general said his program calls for the direct 
participation of everyone this form of decentralization is a 
school for democracy 
the decree says the bureaus mission consists in facilitating 
the voluntary participation of the rural population by identifying 
their needs defining priorities and executing small projects 
selected by the executive 
in a speech in june in which namphy announced his intention to 
do away with the constitution overwhelmingly approved by haitians 
in march 1987 the general said haitians were too poor to enjoy 
democracy 
it is obviously illusory to think that the full enjoyment of 
rights and liberties is possible in the context of absolute 
poverty in which nearly 70 percent of the population of the country 
is vegetating he said then 
fridays decree was the second major one since namphy took power 
last month on july 12 the government abolished the death penalty 
though it had already been abolished in the 1987 constitution

the murder of a 19yearold black woman 
whose body was found with kkk carved on her leg is being 
investigated as possibly racially motivated a prosecutor said 
friday 
district attorney michael kavanagh said he talked with gov 
mario cuomo about the case friday and cuomo had pledged full 
support of state resources to help with the case 
anna kithcart 19 was found dead tuesday but information about 
the letters on her leg were not released until thursday the 
letters were written with a sharp instrument said kavanagh who 
refused to comment on many aspects of the investigation 
as far as racial involvement we are concerned kavanagh 
said we are concerned 
preliminary autopsy results indicated miss kithcart was 
strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument police 
said a bite on the neck and other marks also were found on her 
body 
miss kithcart had last been seen monday evening at the royal 
grill a few doors down from the alleyway where her bloodstained 
sweatsuit was found her partly clothed body was found another 
block away 
while kavanagh wouldnt comment on reports that miss kithcart 
was a drug addict the womans father told the kingston daily 
freeman that his daughter had fallen victim to drugs 
im almost positive it was a drug rub kithcart told the 
newspaper 
the only arrest in the case came wednesday when a man police 
described as a transient was charged with engaging in sexual 
contact with miss kithcarts corpse 
joseph kiernan 41 being held on 10000 bail told radio 
station wdst in woodstock thursday night that he was innocent of 
any charges and thought miss kithcarts body was a lifesized 
pornographic doll when he saw it 
i never saw a dead body before kiernan said i looked 
down and touched it and it felt like rubber sort of warm and sort 
of cold 
kiernan said when he saw the head wound he flipped out and 
ran to call police 
while kiernan was being questioned kavanagh said friday that 
there was still no suspect in the murder 
there are similiarities between the murder and the tawana 
brawley case but there was no evidence of a connection in the 
cases kavanagh said 
miss brawley 16 of wappingers falls was found last november 
with the letters kkk and racial epithets scrawled in a 
charcoallike substance on her skin after being missing for four 
days she later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of 
white men but she and her family have refused to cooperate with 
the investigation 
kingston is about 25 miles north of wappingers falls on the 
opposite shore of the hudson river 
on friday brawley advisers the rev al sharpton and lawyer 
alton maddox arrived at the ulster county jail to conduct what they 
said would be their own investigation of the murder 
if our investigation leads to the kingston police department 
then well go there maddox said 
kavanagh said the brawley advisers appearance in kingston was 
a nightmare come true 
state attorney general robert abrams the special prosecutor in 
the brawley case said he would push the grand jury investigating 
it to begin writing a report next month on what it believes 
happened to the black teenager during the four days she was 
missing late last year 
there may not have been any crime committed here he said in 
an interview about the brawley case reported friday in new york 
newsday if a crime or crimes were committed then you would 
surmise that there would be suspects but abrams said his 
investigation had turned up no suspects

hebers siblings or half siblings were arrested july 1 on 
investigation of auto theft charges after a stolen truck was found 
at a phoenix motel at which they were staying

northern and central nicaragua in violation of a truce with the 
sandinista government the defense ministry said friday 
its report said three of the ussupported rebels known as 
contras and one civilian were killed in the fighting and the 
contras kidnapped 20 people 
the ministry statement said that in one of the attacks on 
thursday three contras died in a shootout with an army patrol in 
northern matagalpa province 
it also said the contras ambushed an army truck in northern 
jinotega province kidnapping 16 people on board and that four 
other people were abducted by the rebels and a civilian was killed 
in central chontales province 
the statement gave no details of the fighting and said nothing 
of any government casualties the contras and the leftist 
sandinista government have accused each other of truce violations 
on and off since the ceasefire began march 21 
representatives from both sides held meetings to try to reach a 
peace accord without success the last round of talks in june ended 
in deadlock and no new meetings were scheduled 
the sandinistas celebrate nine years in power next tuesday the 
insurrection they led in july 1979 ended 42 years of rule by the 
rightist proamerican somoza dynasty 
the army announced on friday a series of military exercises to 
defend managua the capital in case of attack the sandinistas 
have long claimed the united states eventually plans to invade

melton and seven other us diplomats accusing them of conspiring 
to undermine the government 
the interior ministry announced friday night the suspension of 
the radio program el despertar the awakening for 
transmitting false information the statement read over 
staterun radio did not say how long the suspension would be in

friday five minutes ahead of the deadline imposed by the state 
department 
in managua foreign minister miguel descoto issued a statement 
saying tunnermann would remain as nicaraguas ambassador to the 
organization of american states in washington until this

hydrogen bomb developer edward teller once 
told a top administration arms control adviser that a proposed 
star wars laser could potentially shoot down the entire 
soviet landbased missile force a congressional report says 
that and some other details in the report back the charge by a 
disaffected former director of the xray laser research program 
that teller made unsupportable claims about the potential of the 
proposed weapon rep george brown jr said friday 
let me plead guilty to the great crime of optimism teller 
countered friday 
roy woodruff resigned in 1985 as director of the lawrence 
livermore laboratorys research program into the xray laser 
because of the dispute and said he was demoted to an entrylevel 
job 
last year woodruff filed grievances alleging that teller and 
another scientist lowell wood made overly optimistic 
technically incorrect statements regarding this research to the 
nations highest policymakers he also accused roger batzel 
then the labs director of blocking his efforts to correct those 
statements 
an internal study eventually concluded that woodruff was made 
into an unperson because of his dispute with batzel 
the general accounting office report written at browns 
request cited some optimistic statements by teller and wood but 
also concluded that woodruff and his colleagues at livermore shared 
that optimism to some extent 
the report is trying to straddle the fence brown said by 
phone from washington it says that woodruff made similar 
optimistic statements but that in a couple of instances the 
two woodruff objected to most the statements by teller and wood 
were indeed overly optimistic and not factual 
teller interviewed by telephone from livermore contended the 
gao report backs his point of view the report he said shows that 
woodruffs criticisms were over the way teller worded his claims 
but that woodruff supported them in substance 
the claim about the laser being able to shoot down all 10000 
soviet landbased missiles sounds absurd because it was quoted out 
of context the physicist said 
i tried to illustrate the possibly great effects that the 
xray laser might produce teller said if you read the letter 
you will find qualifiers eventually potentially and 
perhaps 
in a telephone interview woodruff also contended that the gao 
report generally backs his point of view but he had some criticism 
for it 
the report he said friday establishes everything i ever 
alleged but i am very unhappy with the finding that suggests there 
was a great deal of similarity between dr teller and myself 
he was an enthusiast for the xray laser and i was an 
enthusiast but the points we differed on were very important 
woodruff said adding i am still struggling to tell the truth 
against what i would call reprisals 
a spacebased system of xray laser beams powered by nuclear 
detonations is no longer viewed as the centerpiece of reagans 
proposed strategic defense initiative known as sdi or star wars 
sdi research now focuses on landbased weapons to defend the united 
states against soviet nuclear missiles brown said

outgoing attorney general edwin meese iii told 
a group of judges and lawyers friday that he objects to the use of 
independent counsels to investigate the executive branch because 
they are for all intents and purposes unaccountable 
without elaborating meese said it is not inconceivable to him 
that someday an independent counsel could be used by congress to 
control the presidency 
taken to its logical conclusion the american people could be 
effectively deprived of their right to vote for the chief executive 
of their own choosing if these fundamental rights are taken away 
piecemeal by congress said meese the attorney general himself 
was recently the target of an investigation by an independent 
counsel 
the creation of such an independent office takes important 
government functions away from politically accountable officials 
and transfers them to ad hoc officials who practically have no 
mechanism for control and who are for all intents and purposes 
unaccountable meese said 
the remarks came in a speech focusing on the separation of 
powers to lawyers and judges attending the 8th circuit judicial 
conference 
enacted in the postwatergate era the 1978 ethics in government 
act set up a system of courtappointed special prosecutors 
subsequently renamed independent counsels to investigate 
allegations of wrongdoing by top officials in the executive branch 
on june 29 in a defeat for the administration the supreme court 
voted 71 to uphold the constitutionality of the 1978 law 
in reference to that opinion meese said how do you determine 
where the line will be drawn since the court itself drew no 
concrete lines some may contend that its possible that virtually 
any executive function could be relegated to an independent office 
so long as it does not positively disable the president from 
accomplishing his constitutional role and positively disabling 
is in itself a somewhat subjective standard 
meese said the president needs to stand up to congress as it 
attempts to acquire more power over the white house 
meese has said he will leave his post with the reagan 
administration by next month he made the announcement after saying 
he was vindicated when independent counsel james mckay filed a 
report with a federal appeals court signifying he had decided not 
to seek criminal charges against the attorney general 
mckay spent 14 months looking into meeses involvement with 
among other things the bankrupt military contractor wedtech corp 
and a 1 billion iraqi oilpipeline project 
mckay has referred his report to the justice department where 
the office of professional responsibility could consider whether 
meese had done anything unethical 
meese had refrained from commenting on the independent counsel 
process while he was under investigation by mckay meese removed 
himself from participation in the justice departments filing of a 
court brief raising objections to the independent counsel statute 
meese said if the trend continued it would not be stretching 
the imagination to envision the appointment of an independent 
arms procurement czar at the pentagon or an independent navy 
controller as a response to the july 3 downing of the iranian 
civilian airliner 
in a brief news conference after his speech meese said he 
approved of president reagans choice of former pennsylvania gov 
richard l thornburgh as his successor 
i think hes an excellent choice meese said hes a man 
ive known for a long time hes a good friend and i think he and i 
think alike on almost every aspect of law enforcement

regular programming to announce the fall of hajj omran after a 
fierce battle between iraqs 5th army corps and irans 
revolutionary guards

defensive positions the evacuation is for a more 
appropriate deployment of combat forces in other defensive lines 
hajj omran penjwin and halabja are all in the sulaimaniya 
region which is inhabited by iranianbacked autonomyseeking 
kurdish rebels 
iran captured the region in an offensive last march it claimed

iraq took the initiative in the war in april dislodging the 
iranians from the faw peninsula in that month and from the 
shalmcheh and oilrich majnoon islands in may and june 
the iranians now control a few scattered pockets in the central 
sector of the 730mile warfront

a federal judge temporarily blocked the 
release of court documents in the massive probe of fraud in the 
defense industry friday saying he will decide in a week whether to 
overturn a magistrates ruling that the media and the public have a 
right to see the documents 
us district judge david kenyon ordered attorneys for the news 
media the government and other interested parties to submit papers 
and be prepared to present arguments july 22 at 2 pm pdt 
federal judges in three other jurisdictions minneapolis 
brooklyn ny and alexandria va rejected other efforts friday 
to unseal affidavits concerning the probe 
the massive investigation which became public last month 
centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed 
pentagon officials for information that helped contractors win 
multimilliondollar contracts 
kenyons decision blocked action on a ruling hours before by 
us magistrate joseph reichmann ordering release of sealed 
affidavits filed with warrants to search the offices of three 
southern california defense contractors and one defense consultant 
reichmanns ruling on a request by attorneys for the los angeles 
times copley newspapers and the national broadcasting corp was 
immediately appealed by the government bringing the case to kenyon 
kenyon said his office had been inundated with calls many of 
them from people who claimed an interest in keeping the documents 
secret and he said he wanted them to give them a chance to be 
heard 
an attorney for one of those individuals appeared in the 
courtroom but refused to identify the person he represented the 
lawyer gordon oconnell said he would tell the judge in a sealed 
document the identity of his client but wouldnt tell anyone else 
he said the person is an employee of one of the companies whose 
plants were searched 
an attorney for the los angeles times said it was likely the 
issue wouldnt be resolved until it reaches the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals he urged kenyon to move more swiftly so appeals 
could go forward but the judge said he felt a week was a 
reasonable continuance 
the government made one concession when it proposed releasing 
innocuous boilerplate sections of each search warrant such as 
its title and description of the fbi agents who executed the 
warrant and of the premises searched but oconnell objected and 
kenyon said he would review the boilerplate sections privately 
and rule monday if they can be released 
in his earlier ruling reichmann was adamant about the publics 
right to know 
corruption bribery these are things that go to the heart of 
how our government functions reichmann said 
we are talking about the foundations of our country the 
defense of our country reichmann said in ruling that the public 
has the right to know through the news media about matters of such 
national importance 
defense consultant fred lackners attorney william dougherty 
said he wanted the affidavit released so he could represent his 
client properly 
the warrants sought in los angeles were used june 13 to search 
the offices of northrop corp teledyne inc litton industries and 
lackners home they were among 33 search warrants executed across 
the country that day 
affidavits attached to the warrants contain statements from 
investigators disclosing evidence they uncovered through 
courtordered eavesdropping and detailing what they are seeking 
through their searches 
in minneapolis us magistrate j earl cudd refused the star 
tribunes request to unseal documents related to the search of 
unisys corps offices in eagan minn but cudd ordered prosecutors 
to explain in writing why they wanted the documents kept secret 
and set another hearing for friday 
in brooklyn us district judge edward korman ordered the 
unsealing of four search warrants but kept the affidavits secret 
he postponed opening the warrants until wednesday to give the 
government time to appeal 
kormans ruling was made on a motion filed by newsday the 
newspaper headquartered on long island 
the search warrants that korman said could be made public 
include those used at the long island home of charles f gardner a 
defense consultant who is a former vice president for the unisys 
corp the office of dennis mitchell a unisys employee at its 
great neck ny plant the offices of the hazeltine corp in 
greenlawn ny and the kane paper corp in baldwin ny which 
supplies paper products to aerospace companies 
in alexandria va two federal judges refused to unseal 
affidavits used to search the office and home of former navy 
official melvyn paisley and the premises of thomas muldoon of 
washington dc both men are defense consultants attorneys for 
paisley and muldoon had sought access to the documents but were not 
seeking full public release 
in a related development friday st louisbased mcdonnell 
douglas corp said its consulting contract with paisley has been 
terminated early by mutual agreement 
it was decided under the present circumstances that mr 
paisley did not have the time to devote to his contract said 
mcdonnell douglas spokesman mike burch he said paisley had been a 
consultant to the company since shortly after leaving the pentagon 
in 1987 and had assisted with a wide range of our product lines 
both military and commercial 
burch said he didnt know when paisleys contract was due to 
expire he refused to disclose how much mcdonnell douglas has paid 
paisley 
after resigning his post as the navys assistant secretary for 
research engineering and systems paisley became a consultant to 
several contractors including mcdonnell douglas martin marietta 
pratt amp whitney and ltv 
a search warrant made public last week said the fbi suspected 
that paisley accepted bribes or gratuities from mcdonnell douglas 
and two other contractors while he was serving at the pentagon 
paisley has also lost unisys corp as a client as the 
corporation ended all contracts with defense consultants for the 
time being unisys told the washington post for a story in 
saturdays editions 
unisys spokesman bill beckham said the consultants whose 
contracts were terminated included paisley and william galvin an 
associate of paisley who also is under investigation in the defense 
probe 
in los angeles us attorney robert bonner told reichmann that 
disclosure of the detailed information in the affidavits would 
alert targets of the investigation and might encourage them to 
destroy documents 
but reichmann sided with attorney rex heincke representing the 
times who said the wide publicity of the defense fraud probe makes 
the sealing unnecessary because the investigation is no longer 
secret 
reichmann said few americans read newspapers or care about the 
outcome of the defense probe but this is about those few people 
who care and who keep this country on its toes 
citizens are entitled to ask are we just throwing our money 
away when we buy these defense programs he said 
bonner also contended that the first amendment right of access 
applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted no 
one has been charged in the defense procurement investigation 
the only affidavit released in the case was unsealed earlier 
this month in dallas but some of the lessdetailed search warrants 
have been released

an explosion and fire at a mobil oil 
refinery killed one man and injured two friday just hours after a 
flash fire in another part of the plant injured five other people 
officials said 
the two fires were not believed to be related and both involved 
employees from private companies contracted by mobil oil said fire 
chief denny haas 
they were different companies with different processes in 
different parts of the plant said haas 
shortly before 10 am a flash fire injured five men from an 
outside contractor who were working on the refinerys sewage 
system said haas investigators believed sparks from a welders 
torch ignited fumes rising from water that was mixed with volatile 
liquids he said 
the second fire erupted about 320 pm and was quickly 
extinguished but the blast left thousands of gallons of toxic 
hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals mixed with oil on the ground 
said haas 
the dead man and the two men injured in the second fire are all 
employees of beneciabased calcat chemical co they were removing 
the residue from pipes containing a number of chemicals when the 
pipes exploded said haas the reason for the blast was not 
immediately determined he said 
of the seven workers injured in the two fires four were 
hospitalized one in critical condition the dead man was 
identified as winston alexander jones 30 no hometown available 
haas said 
after the second fire firefighters sprayed foam on the ground 
to control the spread of the spilt hydrogen peroxide arsenic oil 
and other materials but no evacuations were ordered said haas 
in november a huge blast at the refinery shattered windows 
throughout the area 15 miles south of downtown los angeles sending 
a huge fireball into the air and sparking a blaze that burned for 
two days one refinery worker suffered minor injuries

president daniel ortega said thursday 
that any us decision to resume military aid to nicaraguan rebels 
would amount to newly legitimizing a war in which a truce was 
declared months ago 
a source close to the rebels known as contras said in the 
dominican republic that the leadership would meet this weekend in 
that nations capital santo domingo to reorganize the movement 
leading foes of the leftist sandinista government meanwhile 
vowed that their fight against the governments latest crackdown 
had just begun 
ortega spoke to journalists in campoa 58 miles northeast of 
managua where he inaugurated an agricultural fair 
we hope they the united states do not commit this madness 
since it would be newly legitimizing the civil war that began 
seven years ago he said in remarks broadcast on the state radio 
voice of nicaragua 
the us house of representatives voted 38518 on thursday to 
condemn ortegas government for brutal suppression of basic human 
rights 
a similar resolution passed by the senate by a 914 vote 
wednesday night included the possibility of renewed military aid to 
the contras if sandinista policy did not change the resolution 
would make democratic reform a condition of economic aid to 
nicaragua 
in their resolution house members urged central american 
leaders to convene immediately to assess the conditions in 
nicaragua described in this resolution 
they condemned the sandinistas for arresting 43 demonstrators 
including opposition leaders and closing the opposition newspaper 
la prensa and the roman catholic church radio station this week 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco told the associated 
press the us senate resolution was tremendously interventionist 
and illegal we call this imperialism tinoco said 
patricia orozco of the interior ministrys press office said 31 
antigovernment demonstrators arrested sunday were sentenced by 
police courts to sixmonth jail sentences for violating public 
security laws 
five demonstrators were sentenced similarly on wednesday 
security forces violently broke up the demonstration sunday in 
nandaime south of managua 
the source in santo domingo said more than 50 prominent contras 
were expected to attend the weekend meeting including adolfo 
calero political head of the organization and military 
coordinator enrique bermudez 
internal disputes notably between bermudez and the movements 
political leaders have divided the rebels in recent weeks the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity said new leadership 
was expected to be chosen 
this is a very hard dictatorship enrique bolanos a critic 
of the government said in an interview he is president of the 
superior private enterprise council an opposition group 
they cannot stand the tremendous opposition that is gaining 
momentum bolanos said everybody now knows they are 
marxistleninists 
on monday the sandinistas ordered us ambassador richard 
melton and seven other american diplomats to leave the country 
melton left tuesday and the others followed on thursday 
the reagan administration ordered the same number of nicaraguan 
diplomats out of the united states 
ortegas government expropriated nicaraguas largest and oldest 
sugar refinery on wednesday claiming it was not productive enough 
and the owners the wealthy pellas family were not investing 
enough to keep it going 
the centuryold refinery is a leading symbol of nicaraguan 
private enterprise 
carlos pellas the refinerys general manager told reporters 
thursday the expropriation was a very hard blow for the economy 
he said the related flor de cana rum distillery known 
throughout latin america was legally separate from the refinery 
and not affected by the expropriation 
the crackdown reverses an easing of restrictions on the 
opposition that began in november as part of a central american 
peace plan approved in august 1987 by the presidents of nicaragua 
el salvador guatemala honduras and costa rica 
under the plan the sandinistas and rebels reached a ceasefire 
agreement march 21 that has survived occasional violations 
negotiations on a permanent truce are deadlocked

a merry war is the way one character 
describes the relationship between benedick and beatrice those 
tempesttossed tarttongued lovers in much ado about nothing 
thats pretty much the way its played in central park where the 
new york shakespeare festival opened its boisterous revival of one 
of shakespeares most durable comedies on thursday night 
director gerald freedman opts for the robust rather than the 
romantic in his staging of the play an approach that accentuates 
the laughs rather than the poetry 
fortunately he gets both from kevin kline who probably could 
walk on water if asked to do so by his director 
kline does just about everything else in much ado and he 
accomplishes it with such style wit and grace that he gives 
hamminess a good name the actor makes a firstrate arrogant 
foolish and finally lovestruck benedick 
consider klines entrance in the play its no quiet walkon 
its a fullfledged sword fight staged with an alarming 
athleticism by fight director bh barry in the middle of this 
ruckus beatrice sits quietly and reads a book the battle lines 
are drawn as soon as the play begins 
if blythe danner who appears as the equally obstinate and 
egocentric beatrice cant match the kline juggernaut she gives it 
a good try her beatrice is too much of a lady and her odd almost 
squeaky voice is not particularly suited for shakespeare still 
she exudes an impertinence that mangages to charm benedick and the 
audience by the end of the evening 
a special joy of freedmans production is the strong supporting 
cast which usually fades into the background brian murray makes a 
comical yet touching don pedro the nobleman who instigates the 
matching up of benedick with beatrice and claudio with hero 
don john the melancholy villain of the play is a strange 
character he sets in motion a subplot to besmirch heros honor and 
then disappears david pierce does a fine comic turn all smirks 
and sneers and remains in ones memory even after he leaves the 
stage 
there is more good support from robert gerringer as leonato 
beatrices uncle another of those underrated roles and from jerry 
stiller as the dumbest of dogberrys because beatrice and benedick 
are so strong the actors playing the other set of lovers tend to 
disappear into the plot thats the case with don reilly a 
colorless claudio and phoebe cates a onedimensional hero 
designer john ezell has provided a fairy tale 19th century 
italian town which is where freedman sets the play the costumes 
by theoni v aldredge are colorful and apppropriate to the period 
there is an inevitable falloff after the exuberant first act 
but thats because the ending has been telegraphed long before the 
play is over and the involved plot convolutions must be 
straightened out before the curtain falls 
still this much ado about nothing spins gaily for much of 
the evening and most of it turns because of the whirlwind 
performance of kevin kline he makes it the airiest most bouyant 
production in new york

tiny cracks were found in nearly half the aging 
boeing 737 jetliners known to have been inspected since the top 
ripped off an aloha airlines 737 in late may a federal aviation 
administration official testified thursday 
james w hart jr manager of the airframe branch in the faas 
seattle aircraft certification office described the initial 
responses to an faa airworthiness directive in testimony to a 
national transportation safety board hearing on the accident 
the order issued within a week after the april 28 accident 
required all boeing 737s with 30000 or more landings to undergo a 
special visual inspection of fuselage lap joints or areas where 
parts of the fuselage are bonded and riveted together 
the directive ordered those with more than 50000 landings to 
have additional inspections using highfrequency electronic 
equipment airlines were required to fix any problems found and to 
report the results to the faa 
a flight attendant was killed and 61 persons injured when a 
portion of the fuselage on a boeing 737 peeled off during an aloha 
flight from hilo to honolulu exposing the firstclass section to 
the open air at 24000 feet 
the pilot and copilot managed to land the crippled jet 13 
minutes later in maui although one of the two engines quit 
hart said 291 737s were affected by the inspection order issued 
shortly after the accident as of this week he said the faa has 
received reports on 100 planes of which 49 reported cracks 
the largest crack found was about onehalf inch but most were 
threeeighths of an inch or smaller he said the most found in one 
plane were 31 cracks within a 40inch space five or more cracks 
were found in 14 of the planes he said 
cracks can occur around the rivets used to join the panels hart 
said none of the cracks reported had joined up in other words 
they had not gone from fastener to fastener 
boeing spokesman jack gamble declined comment on the cracks 
until he had spoken with the airlplane manufacturers engineers 
bill ashworth manager of the faas seattle aircraft 
certification division said he was concerned about the cracks but 
saw no imminent danger to the planes or to air passengers 
as of today we have not seen evidence of impending failure in 
any airplane we of course are requiring that all cracks we finds 
be repaired thats only prudent maintenance he said 
in testimony earlier thursday boeings robert l oldani said he 
was shocked to learn in an october 1987 meeting with aloha 
officials that the airline did not have a specific program to 
prevent corrosion of its air fleet 
oldani told the ntsb that henry arii alohas staff vice 
president of quality control and engineering told him that aloha 
had stopped its corrosion control program three years earlier 
much of the testimony at the hearing has focused on technical 
studies of how cracks form in 737s the inquiry is trying to 
determine the cause of the aloha accident but early investigations 
have focused on possible structural failure perhaps aggravated by 
corrosion 
hart told the panel that the faa was formulating very 
demanding new rules to require extensive inspections of early 
737s

insurance problems will delay a plan aimed 
at reducing the spread of aids by distributing free needles to 
intravenous drug users a social service agency official said 
thursday 
kathy oliver executive director of the agency outside in said 
her organization hopes to begin giving out the hypodermic needles 
by late august 
oliver said the insurance company st paul fire and marine of 
st paul minn is concerned about the agencys liability because 
the project which was scheduled to begin this month is 
unprecedented in the united states 
it is difficult to assess the exposure and risk and therefore 
its difficult to determine rates she said 
beth murray spokeswoman for st paul fire and marine said the 
company notified outside in that the project wasnt covered under 
its existing policy 
it takes us into areas of unknown liability she said 
were especially concerned for the potential of the spread of 
aids from needles supplied by the clinic and later reused 
under the yearlong project 125 drug abusers will exchange used 
needles for new ones and receive counseling 
the project is financed by a 67000 grant from the american 
foundation for aids research if the insurance cost increases 
greatly oliver said she is confident that more funds can be 
obtained because of the interest in the experiment nationwide 
st paul the largest medical liability insurer in the country 
has provided comprehensive medical malpractice and liability 
insurance to outside in for 10 years the agency never has had a 
claim filed against its policy 
were negotiating with them to work this out murray said 
theyve been insured with our company for several years and its 
important for us to work it out with them 
oliver said the companys action came as a surprise because the 
problems didnt surface when agency officials spoke with the 
insurance company about the proposed project a year ago and again 
when the financing was obtained earlier this year 
she said the company apparently became concerned after news 
accounts of the project were published outside in learned about 
the problem about two weeks ago she said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most often spread through 
sexual contact sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers or 
by transfusions of blood or blood products experts say

wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 percent 
in june the government said friday but analysts saw cause for 
worry in the steep droughtinduced climb in raw food prices 
the labor department said the hot dry weather searing much of 
the nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by 
more than 20 percent last month pushing raw food prices 42 
percent higher than in may it was the biggest jump since october 
1985

the united states recorded a 109 billion 
trade deficit in may the second smallest imbalance in almost three 
years the government said friday in a report that sent the dollar 
soaring on foreign currency markets 
the reagan administration and private economists were in 
agreement that the commerce department report offered conclusive 
proof that the governments efforts to deal with one of the 
countrys biggest economic problems a seemingly intractable trade 
imbalance were beginning to show results 
the may deficit was actually 627 million higher than a revised 
april imbalance of 103 billion but the april figure was the 
smallest imbalance since a 99 billion deficit in august 1985 and 
the may deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time

eleven of the skeletons each had a 
bullet hole in the skull some with mouths agape as if in a shriek 
a few still had on shreds of the clothing they wore in their last 
living moment 
in a walledoff tenniscourtsized section of avellaneda 
municipal cemetery is a burial ground that authorities believe 
contains the remains of 200 to 300 victims of argentinas dirty 
war of the 1970s when a military dictatorship ruled argentina 
the mass gravesite in this industrial city of 650000 southeast 
of buenos aires is the largest so far found of those believed slain 
by 1970s security forces hunting down subversives 
each weekday six young forensic anthropologists unearth more 
bones in an attempt to document what happened to those victims 95 
percent of whom bear evidence of having been shot in the head from 
shortrange at the peak of the repression in 197678 
most of the victims are of our own generation said the 
teams leader 30yearold morris tidball binz we even found the 
remains of one woman who was 76 its hard to figure out who she 
was a threat to 
the four men and two women of the argentine forensic 
anthropology team have uncovered 83 victims in the four years 
theyve been working together through identifications of 20 of 
those victims three military officers have been convicted of 
homicide or kidnapping 
a government panel created by president raul alfonsin identified 
8961 people who died during those years although human rights 
groups say the number who were abducted vanished and now are 
presumed dead is about 20000 
building legal cases against the killers is one of the goals of 
the team another is documenting what happened in those bloody 
years when scores of suspected leftists data shows half were 
laborers or students disappeared most at night and most 
from their own homes 
most were taken by security men to one of the 340 detention 
centers for questioning many were tortured often fatally 
evidence indicates some were dumped from airplanes into the river 
plate estuary others were tossed in unmarked graves that came to 
be called nn or noname graves 
its not pretty said luis fondebrider at 24 the youngest 
member of the team were trying to piece together what happened 
for historys sake so that hopefully it will never occur again 
the team has no government funding a surprise considering that 
alfonsin a civilian who took over the presidency after the 
military stepped down is a human rights activist who ordered 
trials that convicted five military junta leaders including two 
expresidents 
the team receives 48000 in funding from the new yorkbased 
ford foundation the mitterrand foundation of france and the us 
world council of churches its members take public transportation 
to work and share office space with a human rights group in an old 
threestory building near downtown buenos aires 
the team began in 1984 when tidball binz then a medical 
student was recruited by the renowned forensic anthropologist 
clyde snow of norman okla to help the newly restored democracy 
identify the remains of some dirtywar victims 
five of tidball binzs companions joined the team 
its work involves meticulously excavating a skeleton measuring 
bones making xrays examining dental records and comparing every 
bit to information from the medical charts of the missing their 
findings are entered into a computer 
finding one that matches dental records often horrifies the 
victims relatives 
it is still very very traumatic for the families of the 
victims some even continue denying it the body is who it is 
despite the proof tidball binz said 
whats found in the graves which snow calls a time capsule 
that preserves proof of the identity and cause of death have 
proven damning to those who contended the victims died in gunfights 
with security forces 
in nearly every case uncovered by the team evidence showed they 
had been slain with a shot to the base of the skull from about 
three feet away 
in many cases fragments of bullets from standard policeissue 
shotguns were found in the skull tidball binz said a few cases 
showed victims were pregnant or recently gave birth some burial 
plots contained groupings of choppedoff hands

mix an experimental director from 
communist east germany with richard wagners legendary operas and 
you come up with one of the most eagerly awaited bayreuth seasons 
in years 
a new production of wagners epic ring cycle under east 
german director harry kupfer and celebrated israeli conductor 
daniel barenboim will be the centerpiece of bayreuths richard 
wagner festival which opens on july 26 
from kupfer one can expect a modern perhaps even socially 
critical production critic gerhard koch of the frankfurter 
allegemeine zeitung newspaper said in an interview 
the story of the family tragedy and its elements of greed 
particularly in die walkuere lends itself well to a socially 
critical interpretation 
the new ring production is clearly the highlight of the 
season 
previous festival ring productions have set the old germanic 
myths in various time periods and in styles ranging from bombastic 
to relatively spare and modern 
the festival first held in 1876 transforms the placid northern 
bavarian town of bayreuth for one month every summer into a 
gathering place for wagner lovers across the world 
for nearly 40 years wolfgang wagner the composers grandson 
has been running the festival occasionally also producing festival 
performances 
performances regularly sell out way ahead of time as there are 
only 1925 seats available in the theater wagner built specifically 
for his works 
the theater was financed by bavarias king ludwig ii nicknamed 
mad king ludwig because of his extreme shyness and love of 
overspending on elaborate disneylandlike castles 
according to mathias vogt a spokesman for the festival this 
year was no exception to the festivals sellout tradition 
demand for the festival was greater this year than ever he 
said tickets sold out shortly after going on sale last 
november 
the festival will open with the return of last years 
parsifal directed by goetz friedrich and conducted by james 
levine 
my favorite opera is parsifal and thats why im really 
looking forward to going said wagner fan manfred schuldt 34 of 
hamburg schuldt has been making the annual trek to bayreuth for 
the last 10 years 
but its the new ring production thats causing the most 
excitement he said barenboim has a special style you really 
notice when hes conducting 
barenboim musical director of the renowned orchestre de paris 
will conduct the four works comprising the mighty der ring des 
nibelungen cycle to begin on july 27 with das rheingold the 
other works die walkuere siegfried and 
goetterdaemmerung will follow 
opera lovers also say they are eager to see what east german 
director kupfer does with the new ring production 
thats the sensation of the season to me august everding 
general director of the bayerischen staatstheater bavarian state 
theater said kupfer is a wonderful opera director 
critic koch looked to kupfers 1978 bayreuth production of the 
flying dutchman as a clue to what audiences might expect this 
summer 
it was highly imaginative but critical at the same time he 
said kupfer manages to bring current aspects into his work and 
audiences today can easily identify with it 
other festival presentations will be a return of last years 
romantic opera lohengrin and die meistersinger von 
nuernberg 
opera singers in this years festival include some of bayreuth 
favorites such as siegfried jerusalem as parsifal and siegfried 
franz mazura as klingsor and the wanderer and waltraud meier as 
kundry and waltraute 
among those appearing in bayreuth for the first time include 
alan opie marieclaire oreirdan and jane turner 
there will be a total of 30 performances at the festival which 
runs until aug 29 
meanwhile bayreuth tourist officials laugh at some aspects of 
the summer invasion 
we get people writing letters to the mayor asking for 
tickets bayreuth tourist director jo schumacher said and lots 
of tourists just stumble in here casually and are astounded when 
they cant get tickets 
bayreuth a picturesque town founded in the 12th century also 
shows a number of art exhibits during the wagner festival much of 
them wagner related

democrats assemble this week to give michael 
dukakis a southernstyle sendoff in his race for the white house 
and they can only hope that jesse jackson a born scenestealer 
will decide to play a supporting role 
from monday nights warbling rendition of the star spangled 
banner by radio personality garrison keillor to thursday nights 
acceptance speeches by dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen the 
democratic party has spent many months and many millions on a 
program to boost its chances of winning the white house 
massachusetts gov dukakis marches into dixie on sunday as the 
unquestioned nominee of his party he has more than enough 
delegates to crush any attempt by jackson to alter the bare bones 
platform he decreed and more than enough clout to make sure the 
convention ratifies his choice of texas sen bentsen as running 
mate 
but it will be up to jackson who has the allegiance of roughly 
one quarter of the conventions 4210 delegates to decide how 
unified and harmonious a front the party presents to the fournight 
prime time audience 
as dukakis last remaining rival for the nomination he has 
promised repeatedly to support the democratic ticket this fall but 
he angrily broke off platform negotiations with dukakis last week 
after learning of bentsens selection from a reporter rather than 
from the governor himself 
whatever jackson decides whether he contests the platform 
tries to challenge bentsens spot on the ticket or leaves the omni 
to lead the thousands of supporters who say they will be in the 
streets new englander dukakis nomination will be spiced with a 
southern flavor 
house speaker jim wright of texas will preside as chairman and 
texas state treasurer ann richards will deliver the keynote address 
that is the highlight of monday nights opening session arkansas 
gov bill clinton will place dukakis name in nomination on tuesday 
night in another bow to a region of the country that democrats used 
to win regularly in presidential elections but now seems largely 
out of reach 
on the first night the assembled democrats also will hear from 
former president jimmy carter a native georgian who once served as 
governor 
tuesday nights program is expected to begin with the platform 
and end with a speech by jackson with appearances by sen edward 
m kennedy and other party leaders in between 
jacksons forces have prepared several minority planks to the 
platform and while a vote on some or all is possible the 
differences also may be ironed out in advance delegates will see a 
video presentation about jackson to be introduced by his children 
the party picks its nominee on wednesday with dukakis and 
jackson the only names entered into nomination 
bentsen will be picked for vice president on thursday with or 
without a fight by the jackson forces and then he and dukakis 
will deliver their acceptance speeches 
party officials say that anyone interested in challenging 
bentsens nomination must submit a petition with between 300 and 
600 delegate signatures by thursday morning jackson has more than 
enough supporters in the hall to accomplish that if he wants 
whatever else happens there will be the usual street 
demonstrations outside the hall rumors circulated that the ku klux 
klan would stage a demonstration and party spokesman mike mccurry 
said democratic officials are concerned about the threat of 
violence 
that does concern the party were well prepared to deal 
with any situation that arises he said 
republicans have set up a beachhead in the democrats host city 
and have arranged for several prominent officials to take pot shots 
each day at dukakis and bentsen 
the host city was busy sprucing itself up for its four days in 
the glare of nationwide publicity municipal workers placed 
planters with vibrantly colored flowers along the streets near the 
convention hall 
dukakis campaign volunteers decorated the city with political 
posters and workers in the downtown hotels polished and repolished 
every available surface in anticipation of the arrival of the 
delegates 
dukakis goes into the convention with a modest lead over george 
bush in the public opinion polls and he and his high command hope 
to use the week to pad the margin 
in appearances inside the convention hall and out the 
massachusetts governor will follow a schedule designed to stress 
the themes that secured him the democratic nomination and that he 
intends to repeat in the fall 
rather than spend his time speaking only to party delegate 
caucuses dukakis is expected to spend part of his day campaigning 
away from the hall and the glass and steel downtown hotels that 
house many of the delegates 
a trip to a factory gate is a possibility to dramatize his 
support for the plant closing law that congress is sending to 
president reagans desk he may also visit a school to emphasize 
his opposition to drugs 
aside from the prime time appearances on network television 
including the morning shows on monday and his acceptance speech on 
thursday he is expected to make himself available for television 
interviews by satellite with stations around the country 
aides say he will stress his commitment to creating jobs and his 
support for health care and education and sound the theme of 
ethics in government 
he and other speakers are expected to stress dukakis ethnic 
roots and the governor will be introduced to the convention and 
the television audience on thursday night by his cousin 
oscarwinning actress olympia dukakis 
dukakis nomination will mark the end of a marathon run for the 
partys top prize 
he began the campaign as merely one of seven dwarfs seeking 
the nomination just as methodically as he raised millions of 
campaign dollars he methodically dispatched one rival after 
another in the early primaries and caucuses 
by the time new york held its primary in midapril the race had 
been narrowed to dukakis and jackson and there was never any doubt 
about which of them would win

when eskimo leaders gathered in this 
kuskokwim river village four years ago to create the yupiit nation 
they paused for a day of fishing 
theres always time for fishing said willie kasayulie 
chief of the yupiit nation and chief executive officer of 
akiachaks tribal council peoples lives here revolve around the 
river 
in southwestern alaska fishing for the salmon that migrate 
upstream each summer is no recreational pursuit the fish are a 
major source of income and food for akiachak and dozens of other 
native villages along the winding ribbon of muddy water 
the kuskokwim river is the only highway into town few villagers 
own a car but nearly every household has a boat 
kasayulie 37 figures he spends at least 45 days a year on the 
river part of the time hes catching salmon for sale under his 
limitedentry commercial permit the rest of the time hes fishing 
for personal use 
he and his extended family of 16 catch up to 500 salmon a year 
in driftnets strung from open riverboats they eat most of the fish 
themselves the rest is shared with village elders who cant get 
out to fish anymore 
they cut up dry and smoke the salmon on wooden racks at fish 
camps up and down the kuskokwim 
a few fish are saved for stinkhead an eskimo treat made by 
burying a salmon head in the sand they leave the head to ferment 
for 10 days or so then dig it up wash off the sand and eat it 
they call it stinkhead because it stinks kasayulie said 
i really like it 
august brings a brief respite from the river when kasayulie 
takes the family camping for two or three days to pick about 30 
gallons of blueberries salmonberries and cranberries 
but in the fall hes back in his boat heading up river to hunt 
moose and in the winter when the river freezes solid the fishing 
begins all over again as villagers chop holes through the ice to 
fish for burbot whitefish and pike

in a city where bank closings have become so 
common they fail to attract much notice officials of fondren 
national bank of houston did something that was extraordinary but 
made no headlines 
they built a 900000 bank building and opened it in june 
obviously if we didnt feel things were moving positively we 
wouldnt have done it said frank goldberg the banks president 
we think things are better we know they are 
fondren national with assets of about 37 million is far from 
the largest bank in town but the confidence officials are showing 
in the city mirrors other signs that make some believe the economic 
nightmare that followed the energy crash of the early 1980s is 
slowly ending 
when the oil bust hit houston was left with the image of a city 
of empty skyscrapers unprecedented unemployment banking chaos and 
more recently highly publicized bankruptcies involving prominent 
texans like former gov john connally and surgeon denton cooley 
but even new york bond rating firms are nodding cautiously that 
the worst may be over for houston which in the past decade used 
the energy boom to push past detroit and philadelpia and become the 
nations fourthlargest city 
last month moodys investor service swayed by optimistic pleas 
from top houston officials kept the citys bond rating at the more 
favorable aa category 
we looked at the relationship of the citys attempt to balance 
the current budget and finish the year in a positive mode said 
robert stanley a moodys vice president 
their perceptions of houston were wrong said paul mabry 
spokesman for mayor kathryn whitmire explaining why moodys 
officials changed their minds 
what moodys officials were told is that mrs whitmire will 
resolve an unexpected budget deficit with a recently approved 189 
percent tax increase and they were delivered a rosy picture of a 
city on its way back 
for example unemployment at nearly 13 percent in june 1987 
most recently was reported at 71 percent 
in the 12 months ending in may employment rose by 28000 in 
may alone texas employment commission figures showed the total 
number of people working rose by 15000 to 1495100 
figures also show the city expects at least 20000 new jobs this 
year with economic growth up 2 percent and expanding in subsequent 
years 
city officials also are touting houstons depressed housing 
market as a plus for people moving in noting that home costs and 
apartment rents are among the lowest of major us cities for 
example a 2000squarefoot threebedroom house that sell for 
250000 in boston or los angeles goes for a mere 80000 in 
houston 
barton smith who heads the university of houstons economics 
department is forecasting home prices will jump 10 percent next 
year and continue to climb in the early 1990s 
elsewhere shipments through the port of houston were 302 
million tons through april up 15 percent from the previous year 
at the texas medical center construction worth 15 billion is 
ensuring the complex remains the worlds largest medical center 
and southwestern bell telephone co reported it installed more 
new phone lines in april than any month in nearly three years 
at federal bankruptcy court where clerks were so busy at one 
point that they refused to answer the telephone the number of 
filings has leveled off according to a price waterhouse survey 
although the court received 429 petitions in the first quarter 
of the year up 3 percent from the previous quarter the number 
was 8 percent below the peak third quarter of 1986 and close to the 
average 422 recorded over the past year 
while the overall number of business bankruptcies increased 
slightly during the first quarter various sectors of houstons 
economy showed signs of improvement said donald thomas of price 
waterhouse several companies have announced relocation plans 
moving them to houston with low real estate and wage costs 
houston continues to be an attractive market for corporate 
relocations 
one of them is grumman corp which recently broke ground for a 
50 million space headquarters that is projected to add hundreds of 
jobs 
even houstons legendary traffic problems appear to be easing 
with freeway renovation and construction feverish the first phase 
of a longawaited county toll road project was completed in late 
june with hopes it will unclog two major freeways to the citys 
northern reaches 
on the minus side however are new home sales which trail 
anemic yearago figures by 4 percent for the first quarter of 
1988 the 1520 permits issued for singlefamily homes was down 22 
percent from the same 1987 period 
the general consensus from the people weve talked to is 
that houston is probably at the bottom now according to roy 
bragg editor of the trade publication us housing markets 
and the energy business spoiled when oil prices exceeded 30 
per barrel and knocked nearly comatose when prices slipped beneath 
10 is learning the realities of coping with 1618 oil 
a survey of the citys 50 largest public companies by the weekly 
houston business journal shows 20 lost money in 1987 and 12 of 
those 20 losers are energyrelated firms 
but a forecast by the rice universityaffiliated center for 
economic and demographic forecasting says favorable trends in the 
energy business should continue through 1990 with higher prices 
leading to more significant recovery 
for houstons recovery to expand conditions in the energy 
industry must at least remain stable said michelle foss senior 
associate at the center 
still rice center economists believe that even if oil prices 
soften the citys employment should not be affected greatly 
houstons economic recovery continues and may even be picking 
up speed the economists said 
at fondren national bank employees and customers are glad to be 
in the gleaming new building and out of the mobile home that served 
as the banks temporary quarters 
we have lots of small to mediumsize businesses that are 
customers bank president goldberg said its pretty much 
acrosstheboard and not just in our minds its reflected in those 
businesses things are better almost everywhere

oil prices rebounded from steep losses earlier 
in the week but traders attributed the change to shortterm 
influences and to saudi arabias denial that it was boosting 
production 
on the new york mercantile exchange the nearmonth contract for 
west texas intermediate crude rose 32 cents per barrel from its 
21month low to close thursday at 1476

unleaded gasoline rose 06 cent a gallon to 5054 cents and no 2 
heating oil rose 77 cent a gallon to 4091 cents 
douglas r peterson a broker at edampf man international 
futures inc in new york called it a shortcovering rally meaning 
the rise was caused by speculators who purchased oil to cover 
borrowed contracts that they had sold earlier shortcovering is an 
internal market influence that causes brief price rises 
others attributed the advance to official saudi denials of 
expanded production by the worlds largest oil exporter 
there have been repeated reports that saudi arabia and its key 
arab allies in the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
are sharply raising output in reaction to widespread quota cheating 
by other opec members these reports have played a major role in 
the oil markets recent decline 
other rumors circulating in the market suggested the saudis were 
selling more oil to pay for their multibilliondollar weapons deal 
with britain 
the saudi press agency said the country was the victim of an 
artificial information campaign by oil brokers and their 
agents in the market 
the kingdom strongly denies the truth of such charges and 
wishes to reaffirm its full commitment to its assigned level of 
production by opec the statement read

it is no accident that many department stores 
put their cosmetics counters just inside the front door the area 
with the highest customer traffic 
when bloomingdales redid the first floor of its flagship 
manhattan store a few years ago the centerpiece was the makeup and 
perfume department 
it also is no accident that the front pages of womens magazines 
often are dominated by ads for revlon estee lauder clairol coty 
and other big names in beauty while inside articles dispense tips 
on how women can totally make themselves over 
cosmetics is a big and lucrative business bringing in 17 
billion in sales last year 
the worlds largest cosmetic company avon products inc had 
1987 sales of nearly 181 billion from its cosmetics fragrances 
and toiletries business that produced a 2513 million pretax 
profit 
numbers like that make successful cosmetic companies desirable 
properties ronald o perelman battled for three months in 1985 
before finally winning a 165 billion takeover fight for revlon 
inc one of the worlds top cosmetic manufacturers 
the profitable business lately has come under scrutiny by 
congress too the house small business panel on wednesday held a 
hearing to examine health and safety questions about cosmetics 
some of which are said to contain chemicals that could cause 
cancer birth defects central nervous disorders skin and eye 
irritations and allergic reactions 
cosmetics are profitable because they are relatively inexpensive 
to produce and their prices can be marked up heavily because of 
snob appeal the cosmetic industry has its own equivalent of 
designer fashions 
for example a mascara by maybelline was priced at 3 in a 
manhattan drug store while a similar estee lauder product sold for 
10 at saks fifth avenue 
manufacturers and retailers both are big beneficiaries of 
makeups high profit margins 
if you pay 10 for an item the manufacturer probably gets 
6 leaving 4 for the retailer said diana temple a cosmetic 
industry analyst for the investment firm salomon brothers inc 
one reason why retailers do so well from makeup is that at 
bigger department and specialty stores such as bloomingdales 
marshall fields nordstrom and macys the people selling the 
cosmetics often are paid at least in part by the manufacturer ms 
temple said 
in shopping for cosmetics women generally are motivated by 
price and the image created for the product by ad campaigns 
but if you put the maybelline mascara and the estee lauder item 
side by side is there any difference between the ingredients of 
the two 
not a heck of a lot said jack salzman an analyst with the 
investment firm goldman sachs amp co 
there are differences in quality but the differences in price 
are greater ms temple said 
cosmetics sell because they can make women more glamorous but 
they also have given the people associated with the industry their 
own special aura 
the late charles revson one of the founders of revlon was 
constantly in the society pages and actress lauren hutton made it 
into the movies after her impeccably madeup face appeared in many

you can quit cringing at the first sight of 
those longdistance telephone commercials telephone admakers plan 
to lighten up 
atampt is winding down its use of ads that show corporate 
underlings getting chewed out by the boss or worrying that they 
might be fired for picking the wrong telephone service instead 
it is phasing in new ads that show its employees describing how 
they can help your business 
competitor us sprint meanwhile plans to begin using a new 
series of ads next week that indirectly pokes fun at atampts old 
approach as it humorously demonstrates how important it is to get a 
clear line when you want to place a business call 
the ads were directed by joe sedelmaier best known for his 
wheres the beef ads for wendys and his fasttalker spots for 
federal express 
in one new sprint ad four men are in an office waiting for the 
bosss call thats him they say as the phone rings 
but as the camera catches every expressive twitch of the face of 
the guy who picks up the phone the boss instructions are reduced 
to gibberish because of the poor quality of the phone line 
listen carefully 500 cases by monday well lose the 
account are some of the fragments that can be heard 
after the boss hangs up the man who took the call dutifully 
repeats for the others exactly what he heard 
the message is that this wont happen if you use sprint but 
there is no suggestion that somebody is about to lose his job over 
it 
sprint executives and their admakers at j walter thompson in 
san francisco said they felt the ads coming from american telephone 
amp telegraph co and to a lesser extent from mci communications 
corp were depressing and colorless 
we wanted to be upbeat we wanted to be fiesty and we wanted 
to poke fun at atampt who lately have been taking themselves too 
seriously said sherry carniglia the sprint account director for 
thompson 
mci which is based in washington dc has been using a series 
of ads that show nononsense business types who describe a wide 
range of mci services that they say helps businesses operate more 
efficiently and at lower cost 
in one ad an mci technical supervisor looks wistfully out his 
office window and says maybe some day well work 9 to 5 at 
least thats what i tell my wife in another ad a comptroller 
snaps i want to know where every dollar is going and adds 
that mcis billing itemizes every call 
but the sprint admakers also wanted to be noticed and felt 
sedelmaiers deft touch for making people smile could help them do 
that 
sprint a joint venture of gte corp of stamford conn and 
united telecommunications inc of kansas city mo is running 
behind atampt and mci in the estimated 50 billion a year 
longdistance market 
jack grubman telecommunications analyst for the investment firm 
painewebber estimates atampt has about 7273 percent of the 
intercity longdistance market while mci had about 10 percent and 
sprint about 7 percent 
the companies refuse to say how much they spend on advertising 
burke stinson an atampt district manager in new york said the 
company knew that the grim ads it put on the air last winter would 
make some people uneasy but believed they would get the attention 
of decisionmakers in small and mediumsize businesses 
he said the plan always had been to run the first wave of ads 
for about six months and then phase them out by the fall as a 
second wave of ads rolled out that featured bright atampt employees 
talking about what the company offers 
the plan was to get peoples attention then the question has 
to be how are you going to help me stinson said

a courtordered rematch of the proxy fight beween 
coniston group and gillette co would be unprecedented and would 
strengthen the new york partnerships attempt to control the 
personal care giant according to industry analysts 
a federal judge said wednesday he was inclined to order a new 
proxy vote in the sixmonth battle because gillette misled 
stockholders about coniston before the election 
analysts said institutional investors seeking a quick profit 
from the personal care giant probably own more gillette stock than 
before the april vote and would be more likely to back conistons 
dissident slate of board candidates 
coniston controls about 58 percent of gillettes common shares 
outstanding the partnership wants to win board seats to pressure 
the 12member gillette board to sell the company which coniston 
believes would boost the value of its stock 
i think its safe to assume that there are more arbitragers 
holding gillette today than back in march said nancy hall an 
analyst with smith barney harris upham i think that gillette is 
definitely viewed as a speculative plot 
judges in the past have ordered new proxy votes but that 
typically has been in cases involving huge vote discrepancies where 
a new vote was deemed irrelevant the gillette case is rarer 
because it involves information a judge determined could have 
affected the outcome 
the court found that there was something misleading said 
robert todd lang a partner with the new york law firm weil 
gotschal amp manges this doesnt happen very often usually when 
you have a challenge its a challenge to the tally 
in the april 21 election gillettes 27000 shareholders 
rejected conistons slate of four candidates to the board by 52 
percent to 48 percent proportion 
us district judge mark l wolf said at wednesdays hearing 
that he was inclined to order a new election because the essence 
of the election was tainted in a material way 
last week wolf ruled gillette misled stockholders about 
coniston in newspaper advertisements leading up to the proxy vote 
he also said a failure by bostonbased gillette to disclose a 
series of standstill agreements with potential suitors was not 
misleading and would not have affected the election 
wolf scheduled a trial the week of aug 22 on gillettes charges 
that coniston violated federal securities laws by failing to 
disclose the limited partners in rb partners a bahamian company 
formed to buy gillette stock 
the judge said wednesday that regardless of his ruling in the 
second phase of the case he is likely to order the new vote 
coniston has asked for a new election of eight directors in the 
fall preempting gillettes normal spring meeting 
coniston principal augustus k oliver said stockholders would 
consider the standstill agreements under which 10 companies 
agreed not to attempt to buy gillette for two years ending in 
november if wolf orders a new election 
i think theres a totally new mix of information available to 
stockholders oliver said well just have to see next time 
around whether thats enough to change things 
gillette sued coniston in april alleging the securities law 
violations the new york investment firm responded with its claim 
of misrepresentation 
the counterclaim was heard in court first because judge rya 
zobel then handling the case felt that if coniston lost its 
challenge to the proxy vote then gillettes case would be moot 
the judge indicated he was still evolving his thinking and he 
hasnt come up with a remedy yet gillette spokesman david fausch 
said one of the remedies that is possible is a new election 
lets take that at face value

the head of farmers group inc says a hostile 
takeover attempt of the company by a british conglomerate should be 
dropped following the rejection of the plan by oregons insurance 
commissioner 
batus inc a louisville kybased subsidiary of the british 
bat industries plc has offered 45 billion for the los 
angelesbased farmers farmers directors rejected the proposal 
oregon insurance commissioner ted kulongoski concluded on 
thursday that the proposed buyout of farmers insurance co of 
oregon would adversely affect farmers policyholders and 
competition in oregons insurance trade 
kulongoski cited the intention of batus which owns a major 
tobacco company to restrict the nonsmoker policies sold by 
farmers 
director kulongoskis decision on this matter confirms our 
belief that this proposed transaction would ultimately be 
detrimental to farmers and its oregon policyholders said leo e 
denlea jr farmers chairman 
batus said in a statement it was completely astonished by 
the decision 
a cursory reading of the decision strongly suggests that the 
commissioner has reached conclusions that are contrary to law and 
appear to be unsupported by the record and the facts a spokesman 
said 
kulongoskis order can be appealed to the courts the takeover 
bid as now structured would require approval of insurance 
regulators in nine states 
californias insurance commissioner also has rejected the 
proposal and arizona has approved it 
following the recent decision by the california department of 
insurance this is a second very significant setback to batus 
unwanted hostile takeover attempt denlea said we believe that 
batus will face further regulatory difficulties in current and 
pending reviews by other state insurance departments 
kulongoski citing his role as hearings officer in the case 
made only limited remarks outside his statements in the order 
he said the case is unique in oregon insurance history because 
it does not involve a troubled insurer being acquired by a more 
financially sound company 
rather it is the proposed acquisition of a very wellmanaged 
company by a larger company seeking to diversify into the financial 
services market in this country kulongoski said 
batus statement also took issue with kulongoskis 
characterization of farmers as wellmanaged 
the statement to the effect that this is not a financially 
distressed company but rather a wellmanaged one being acquired by 
a larger company seeking to diversify suggests that the decision 
is antitakeover rather than protection for the policyholders 
the statement said 
the commissioner in his ruling said the proposed acquisition 
subjects policyholders and shareholders to substantial risks 
while providing no benefit that farmers does not already enjoy 
he also said the continued denials by bat and batus of the 
known adverse health effects of tobacco smoking and its stated 
intentions of precluding farmers from referring to such health 
effects in its marketing literature do not promote the interest of 
the insurancebuying public 
batus owns brown amp williamson tobacco corp along with retail 
concerns including saks fifth avenue and marshall fields

macmillan inc said it would appeal a judges 
ruling that blocks the publishing giant from proceeding with a 
massive massive restructuring designed to thwart an unwanted bid 
from the robert bass group 
after nearly five weeks of consideration jack b jacobs of the 
delaware chancery court on thursday issued a 58page opinion 
granting basss request for a preliminary injunction that 
effectively blocks the restructuring 
macmillan said in a statement that it was taking an expedited 
appeal to the delaware supreme court in an effort to reverse the 
decision 
an unidentified macmillan spokesman said in the statement that 
jacobs ruling was erroneous as a matter of law and that 
macmillan was confident of succeeding on appeal 
the ruling came after the close of the stock market but in 
trading on te new york stock exchange macmillan fell 50 cents to 
74 on thursday 
josy ingersoll an attorney representing the texasbased bass 
group had no comment on whether bass would proceed with a tender 
offer the group previously had said it would launch a tender offer 
upon granting of a preliminary injunction 
theres no action to prevent anybody from doing a tender 
offer she said the bass group also has said it has the 
necessary financing to complete its 19 billion buyout 
bass originally offered to acquire macmillan for 64 a share in 
may but raised his bid to 73 a share or about 19 billion for 
the 901 percent of macmillan shares the group does not already own 
after the publisher unveiled its restructuring plan 
ingersoll said the judge found that macmillans attempt to 
restructure was an unreasonable response to basss takeover 
proposal 
based on legal precedents when a board does something in 
reaction to an offer for the company there has to be a threat 
and there wasnt a threat in this case she said from her 
wilmington del office 
bass had charged that macmillans restructuring which would 
have separated the companys information services and publishing 
operations into two separate publicly traded companies was 
inadequate and misleading the group also charged that the plan 
would have transferred control to four top macmillan executives for 
a cheap price 
in rejecting basss buyout offer as well as a counter proposal 
to restructure the company macmillan repeatedly said its own plan 
was in the best interest of shareholders 
macmillan was just hours away from beginning its restructuring 
which included paying shareholders a special 5235ashare 
dividend when jacobs issued a temporary restraining order on june 
10 
basss restructuring plan would pay shareholders a dividend of 
58 per share

a government report noting that japanese work 
longer than people in other industrialized nations but have less 
buying power calls for improved working and living conditions in 
this country 
the report issued by the labor ministry friday urged shorter 
work weeks lower consumer prices more housing land and cheaper 
housing 
the report said japanese worked an average 2150 hours in 1986 
the last year for which such statistics were available compared to 
1938 hours for britons 1924 hours for americans 1655 hours for 
west germans and 1643 hours for the french said atsuko ishii of 
the ministrys labor affairs division 
of japans total workforce of 608 million 5911 were employed 
in 1987 for an unemployment rate of 28 percent compared to 62 
percent in the united states 79 percent in west germany 104 
percent in britain and 106 percent in france according to miss 
ishii 
japan calculates its unemployment rate differently from other 
western countries counting its armed forces and those who work as 
little as one hour a month japanese officials say japans official 
rate would be about double if it were calculated by western methods 
women accounted for 365 percent of the work force last year 
the report said 
the average workers annual salary in 1987 was 499 million yen 
or 38380 including summer and winter bonuses miss ishii quoted 
the report as saying 
workers in primary industry farming forestry fishing and 
mining numbered 541 million or 93 percent of all workers in 
1985 the most recent year for which statistics were available she 
said 
in the secondary or manufacturing industry there were 1933 
million workers or 331 percent of the working population 
the largest number of workers in 1985 were 3344 million in 
tertiary industry defined as power and water supply transport 
communications sales food financial real estate and public 
sectors the report said they represented 537 percent of japans 
working population that year miss ishii said 
the report noted 189 percent of japans workforce was older 
than 55 last year as opposed to 129 percent in the united states 
and 102 percent in west germany

wholesale prices one step short of retail rose 
a moderate 04 percent in june the government said today but the 
drought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaring 
at their steepest pace in more than 2 years 
the labor department said raw costs jumped 42 percent last 
month a rate not seen since the 51 percent climb of october 1985 
further along in the wholesale process however prices for foods 
ready to be retailed rose 11 percent reflecting earlier though 
less severe increases in raw food costs 
some examples of price increases at the unprocessedfood level 
wheat 253 percent 
corn 243 percent 
turkeys 228 percent 
soybeans 220 percent 
chickens 225 percent 
reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animals 
they cannot afford or find feed for cattle prices fell 52 percent 
while hog prices were down 40 percent 
the news was not quite so severe at the finishedgoods level 
prices for eggs rose 160 percent while turkey prices gained 93 
percent chicken prices jumped 73 percent and fresh fruit costs 
gained 67 percent 
those gains were partially offset by a 57 percent decline in 
vegetable prices and a 22 percent decrease for rice 
stacy kottman an economist at georgia state university said 
that prices of foods made from grain such a vegetable oils bakery 
products and pasta likely will continue to rise and that the drop 
in vegetable prices wont last meat prices should continue to fall 
through late autumn but will then head higher after the 
droughtinduced slaughtering tails off he said 
next year well probably see the full impact of the drought 
particularly if it persists up until this week we could say 
well if we get some rain well probably be all right but this 
week is the last week we can say that he said 
energy prices meanwhile fell at the finished level by 16 
percent leading the way was a drop of 71 percent for fuel oil 
while declines of 24 percent and 10 percent were posted for 
gasoline and natural gas respectively 
further energy price declines are considered likely because 
crude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowest 
levels in nearly two years 
we can just thank our fortunes that opec cant get together on 
restraint of production i hate to think what the report would look 
like if oil prices were rising kottman said 
in other economic news 
the commerce department said the us trade deficit rose 
slightly in may to 109 billion but the imbalance was still the 
second smallest in almost three years the gap between imports and 
exports widened by 627 million from a revised april imbalance of 
103 billion 
the federal reserve board said production at the nations 
factories mines and utilities rose a moderate 04 percent in june 
the ninth consecutive month without a decline the june increase 
boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave 
pushed industrial output 58 percent higher than it was a year ago 
business inventories in may rose a moderate 06 percent to 
7284 billion held in check by a 09 percent jump in sales to 
4837 billion the commerce department said 
overall if the june increase in wholesale finished goods prices 
held for 12 straight months the inflation rate would be 46 
percent annually more than double the 22 percent rise of 1987 
subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices 
wholesale prices rose 03 percent last month 
analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economys 
underlying inflation even with steep food price gains anticipated 
for the several months many economists feel the effect of those 
gains will be only temporary 
for the first half of 1988 prices one step short of retail rose 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 36 percent excluding food 
and energy prices wholesale costs rose 40 over that period 
prices from march through june have risen at a monthly rate of 
either 04 percent or 05 percent 
at the finished level the department gave these other price 
changes 
passenger car prices up 10 percent 
womens clothing up 10 percent 
home electronic equipment down 22 percent 
cosmetics down 06 percent 
the june increase brought the wholesale price index for finished 
goods to 1079 meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods 
costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 10790 last month 40 cents 
more than in may 
this calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations as are 
other calculations in the report 
the consumer price index which tracks services and imported 
goods not included in the wholesale price report has risen at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 44 percent over the first five 
months of the year the same rate as for all of 19878 
consumer price figures for june will be released next week

americas trade deficit expanded only slightly in may and 
inflation remained moderate in june the government said today in 
encouraging reports that sent the dollar soaring 
the commerce department said the trade deficit rose to 109 
billion in may from a revised 103 billion in april but the 
number was still the second smallest in almost three years and well 
within economists expectations 
imports rose 34 percent to about 376 billion but the 
increase was offset by a 23 percent increase in exports which 
rose to about 266 billion very close to the record level for 
exports set in march 
the labor department said wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 
percent in june despite a searing drought that sent prices for raw 
food soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2 years 
in other reports released today the federal reserve said june 
industrial production rose 04 percent largely because of higher 
electricity output and the commerce department said may business 
inventories rose 06 percent which suggested a slight slowdown in 
sales 
but those reports werent watched as closely as the news on 
trade and inflation which was better than many thought and sent 
money traders scrambling to buy dollars the currencys strong 
advance prompted some central banks to sell dollars in the market 
to stem the rise traders reported 
in new york the dollar surged over 18750 marks in hectic 
trading compared with 18507 late thursday and 13510 japanese 
yen compared with 13318 late thursday the british pound fell to 
1662 from 1689 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
about 7 points to the 2121 level in early trading but retreated 
by late morning in the bond market the treasurys key 30year 
issue also rose on the trade and inflation news but fell back later 
and was little changed by late morning 
on thursday the markets reacted indifferently to a hike in the 
prime rate by major banks from 9 percent to 95 percent the 
highest in more than two years stocks and the dollar rose slightly 
and bonds were mixed 
the banks hike in the prime rate which had been widely 
expected in the financial markets reflected a rise in their own 
borrowing costs and signaled more expensive loans for consumers and 
businesses 
the move marked the second time this year the nations banks 
have raised the prime which is used to calculate a range of 
fixedand adjustablerate corporate and consumer loans 
economists had been expecting such a move because of evidence 
that the federal reserve has tightened credit over the past few 
months in an attempt to curb inflation 
the rate increase came one day after the central banks 
chairman alan greenspan told congress that the fed had been 
tightening and that holding down inflation remained his key 
priority some economists saw a significant connection between his 
remarks and the banks action 
in other economic news on thursday 
the commerce department said retail sales rose a moderate 05 
percent to a seasonally adjusted 1328 billion in june it said 
sales rose 03 percent in may an upward revision from the previous 
estimate of 01 percent 
president reagan toured the droughtstricken farm belt and 
promised farmers that we will do everything that we can to 
help at the same time he called on congress to act quickly on a 
package of legislation aimed at making emergency federal aid 
available to farmers 
the senate agriculture committee approved disaster legislation 
that would provide payments of up to 100000 each to farmers whose 
crops have been wrecked by the drought

grain and soybean futures opened lower but 
quickly turned mixed in volatile activity today on the chicago 
board of trade 
analysts attributed the lower opening to a continuation of the 
profittaking that surfaced late in thursdays session following 
two days of sharply higher prices 
forecasts for another month of hot dry weather in the parched 
corn belt provided incentive for traders to bid prices higher this 
morning but uncertainty about the prospects for rain next week 
added an element of edginess to the markets analysts said 
people are not sure were not going to get another rain front 
in the middle of next week and the markets are very very

william j mccarthy the teamsters top man in 
new england for two decades today upset jackie pressers 
handpicked choice to succeed him as president of the nations 
largest union 
the teamsters 1member general executive board picked mccarthy 
69 of boston over secretarytreasurer weldon mathis who presser 
had named acting president on may 4 
while several of the teamsters 16 regional vice presidents had 
jockeyed for position to succeed presser the race had narrowed to 
mccarthy and mathis in the last week 
mccarthy who has a reputation of being a tough negotiator with 
a quick temper will serve out pressers fiveyear term which 
expires in 1991 when the union holds its next international 
convention 
presser 61 had been president of the 16million member union 
since 1983 at the time of his death from cancer last saturday he 
was under federal indictment on charges of labor racketeering and 
embezzlement 
the government is attempting to seize control of the union 
through a courtappointed trustee claiming its entire leadership 
is either under the control of organized crime figures or incapable 
of removing their influence from teamster affairs 
among the allegations in the government takeover suit filed two 
weeks ago is that mob bosses in chicago and new york were behind 
elevating roy williams to the unions presidency in 1981 and 
presser to the post in 1983 
a federal criminal court jury in may found that the government 
lacked sufficient proof and attorneys for the union have 
vehemently argued there is no organized crime influence at the top 
of the union 
while several of the teamsters 16 regional vice presidents had 
jockeyed for the position sources close to the union said the race 
had narrowed to mathis and mccarthy 
mathis 62 was picked by presser in 1985 to be the teamsters 
no 2 official a year later presser engineered a change in the 
unions constitution so that mathis rather than first vice 
president joseph trerotola of new york would fill his shoes if he 
were incapacitated 
mccarthy a teamster vice president since 1969 was said by 
several sources thursday to have the support of at least seven 
other board members including trerotola veteran head of the 
unions east coast operations 
the presser forces have lined up behind mathis and the 
trerotola forces have lined up behind mccarthy one source said 
thursday everyones reading is that it is real close 
breaking a longheld tradition to keep internal disputes among 
teamster leaders behind closed doors mccarthy has spoken out in 
local union halls condemning the unions new threeyear national 
master freight agreement with the trucking industry 
the contract covering some 200000 members was rejected in may 
by 64 percent of those voting however mathis declared it ratified 
under the unions constitution which requires a twothirds no vote 
for disapproval 
according to one source mathis offered during a board meeting 
two weeks ago in montreal to support mccarthy for the no 2 job but 
mccarthy declined 
ten days after he was named acting president mathis resigned as 
president of teamsters local 728 in atlanta his base of power in 
the union the labor department is investigating allegations of 
vote fraud made by dissidents who had challenged mathis 
reelection as the locals president last fall

like a casino player fingering the chips in his 
pocket corporate raider carl c icahn is likely to wait awhile 
before he walks up to the window and cashes in his texaco inc 
stock for a multimilliondollar prize 
the beleagured oil giants largest shareholder and most vocal 
critic is just days away from being able to sell his roughly 36 
million shares and keep the profits 
but will he 
speaking from his new offices in mount kisco ny icahn said 
that at this point we havent made any decision yet about the 
148 percent texaco stake 
he noted there is a myriad of possibilities including doing 
nothing and weve made no determination of what were going to 
do 
under the shortswing profit rule a holder of more than 5 
percent of a companys stock must keep those shares for at least 
six months otherwise any profits revert back to the company that 
period ends wednesday for icahn 
texaco stock traded at just over 45 a share on friday at that 
price icahn has a paper profit of about 410 million based on his 
average purchase price of 34 a share 
wall streeters agree icahn is least likely to just dump the 
shares on the open market considering the depressing effect such a 
move would have on texacos stock price 
the bottom line is that neither texaco nor icahn want to see 
the shares go down said paul ting an analyst at the investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co 
far more handsome would be the sale of icahns shares in a block 
to a third party willing to pay a heftier price at 60 a share 
the price icahn put on the table in his proposed 14 billionplus 
buyout he would reap nearly a billion in profits 
icahn would not comment on whether he had spoken recently with 
husky oil ltd or gulf canada ltd two companies with whom he once 
discussed a joint texaco bid 
its impossible to know if he is under pressure to liquidate 
something said rosario ilacqua a vice president at nikko 
securities co international inc but if he believes the assets 
are worth 70 to 80 a share why would he sell at 46 
when asked whether texaco had been in contact with icahn 
regarding the disposition of his holdings a spokeswoman said the 
white plains nybased company does not comment on the 
activities of our shareholders 
but a source close to the company said obviously texaco is 
concerned about icahn they know that he is not someone you take 
lightly 
i would assume texaco management would like to get him out 
and get their stock up in the 50s ilacqua said 
icahns concession of defeat in a heated proxy contest for five 
seats on texacos board does not put the oil giants managment in 
the clear 
some experts speculate icahn might be waiting to see just how 
close he came in the battle which took place last month at the 
companys annual meeting texaco has said it would take between 
three and four weeks for an official tally and results are 
expected soon 
icahn who also heads twa corp was dealt what might have been 
a fatal blow in the fight by the aggressive leveraged buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which voted its 49 percent stake 
for texaco management 
in conceding defeat shortly after kohlbergs announcement icahn 
called the companys stake the swing vote 
but analysts are not so sure one suggested icahns losing 
margin may have been far wider than he has let on 
if it had been a close call he wouldnt have conceded 
defeat said one analyst who asked not to be quoted by name 
his nature is being a battler stubborn and persistent 
meanwhile texaco is kneedeep in its own restructuring which 
includes a 3 billion payment to pennzoil co to settle a lawsuit 
resulting from texacos 1984 acquisition of getty oil co after 
pennzoil had made earlier moves to acquire getty 
in addition texaco has begun selling off up to 5 billion worth 
of marginally profitable assets and says it will distribute 17 
billion of the proceeds to shareholders 
that coupled with the 3ashare annual dividend the oil 
company has resumed paying already spells a decent return for icahn 
wall street insiders look upon icahn as a trader type 
someone whose longterm strategy may be vague and whose forte is 
quick decisions 
a month ago one analyst said he would rather go to vegas 
than predict what icahn might do when asked again this week he 
said he would still rather go to the gambling resort

prices finished marginally lower friday on 
londons stock exchange as the market was stumped by us trade 
figures 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished the 
session off 18 points or 01 percent at 18615 
trading volume was a healthy 5915 million shares compared with 
thursdays 5266 million shares 
the commerce department reported that the us merchandise trade 
deficit widened to 109 billion in may from a revised 103 
billion shortfall in april but the latest deficit came well within 
the expected range 
we wouldve known what to do had it been high or low but when 
the figures came in close to home we didnt know what to do with 
it one equity salesman said 
glenn davies an equity analyst at clalexanders laing 
cruickshank ltd said the trade figures amounted to damp 
fireworks for equities 
financial markets are beginning to prepare themselves for 
another interest rate hike davies said 
a government report that britains retail price index rose 04 
percent in june compared with may and was up 46 percent from june 
1987 heightened suspicions that british interest rates might be 
headed higher 
people are definitely concerned about higher interest rates

everyone is worrying about inflation but a lot 
of folks are doing something about it and they just might have the 
final say 
those folks are consumers and they have been resisting price 
increases for several years now and seem intent on continuing their 
vigilance this isnt an assumption the activity shows up in 
official statistics 
the measurements that prove the case are the gross national 
product implicit price deflator and the gross national product 
fixedweight price index 
for practical purposes the important thing to remember about 
the fixedweight price index is that it measures only changes in 
prices and these prices are of the same products month after month 
the implicit price deflator is a bit more sophisticated 
measuring not just prices but changes in the composition of 
purchases it has been rising much more slowly than its more rigid 
cousin 
the importance of this disparity is that it indicates a 
resistance to price increases by consumers they have continued to 
buy but they have avoided items rising in price and when 
possible switched to more stable items 
such behavior is enormously significant suggesting a 
fundamental change in consumer attitudes from earlier periods 
an analysis by wright investors service contrasts this price 
resistance to the attitude that prevailed during much of the 1960s 
and 1970s when consumers simply went ahead and bought in fact 
many consumers bought more than they needed at any given time 
convinced that future prices would be even higher 
those were very different times consumers were fatalistic 
convinced that they could have little impact on pricing factors 
why try to hold down the budget when opec was forcing up gasoline 
and heating oil prices 
but there was more to it than that many workers had broad 
costofliving increases built into union contracts enabling them 
to offset higher prices industrys attitude toward wage increases 
was simply to give in and then raise prices and for reasons not 
explained logically there existed a feeling that inflation was a 
way of life that couldnt be disciplined 
in those days the two indicators of inflation rose in relation 
to each other it was only in the 1980s that they began to diverge 
indicating that consumers felt they could do something about 
pricing such as declining to buy 
this relatively new sense of consumer power is especially 
noticeable in automobile sales which for several years have relied 
on incentives take away those incentives and sales dive replace 
them and they rise again 
it has occurred in housing sales as well as many wouldbe 
sellers in some of the more affluent neighborhoods have discovered 
over the past few months houses that a year ago sold within days 
of listing now remain on the market for months even though 
mortgages have been relatively easy to obtain 
some retailers are complaining but in view of todays consumer 
attitude you might say they should have known better early this 
year apparel prices rose sharply followed quickly by sales 
problems for many apparel retailers 
the new attitude hasnt been lost on producers of services and 
manufactured goods many of whom have chosen to absorb higher costs 
in order to maintain sales rather than pass on increases and lose 
customer loyalty 
the resistance applies even to interest rates strange as it 
sounds to some folks who couldnt get an appointment with a bank 
loan officer a few years ago many banks now advertise for 
customers especially for home loans 
the new attitude can be found in of all places wage 
settlements learning from the 1970s when wage increases were more 
than offset by price increases workers have been seeking less 
opting instead for wageprice stability 
it is encouraging news this inflation fight by a lot of 
ordinary folks together they make an antiinflation force as 
strong as almost any other perhaps even matching the vaunted power 
of the august federal reserve board

german automaker audi says it will appeal a 
jurys award of nearly 22 million to a braindamaged woman 
injured in a crash the jury blamed partly on an alleged defect in 
her car 
a superior court jury made the award wednesday to diane rose 
53 who was injured when her 1981 audi 5000s crashed into a wall as 
she drove down benedict canyon in may 1982 
the jury agreed with mrs roses lawyers contention that the 
accident was caused by a design defect that places the cars gas 
and brake pedals too close together jurors found audi 75 percent 
at fault and ms rose 25 percent responsible for leaving her seat 
belt unbuckled 
audi denies there is any defect and argued that mrs rose took 
a curve too fast and lost control said spokesman joseph bennett at 
audi of america inc in troy mich the company a division of 
volkswagen of america inc will appeal the decision he said 
thursday 
mrs rose was alone in the car and there were no witnesses the 
case rested on testimony of expert witnesses from each side 
the case is unrelated to uncontrolled acceleration problems in 
automatictransmission audi 5000s models that prompted a 1987 
recall of all 240000 audi 5000 models sold in this country since 
1978 the cars were fitted with shiftlock devices which require a 
driver to press the brake pedal before operating the automatic 
transmission 
in addition to the almost 22 million award to mrs rose the 
jury awarded her husband joseph 700000 for his suffering 
mrs rose suffered a broken neck brain damage and bladder 
problems and has incurred medical expenses of more than 500000 
her lawyers said 
the jury found volkwagen innocent of malice despite the design 
defect ruling the company did not deliberately disregard the 
rights and safety of others 
the audi 5000 has been recalled twice before in 1982 to raise 
the height of the brake pedal so the brakes will work even if the 
driver steps on the brake and accelerator pedal at the same time 
and in 1981 to anchor floor carpets so they couldnt slide up over 
the accelerator and keep it from rising when the drivers foot is 
removed

million have sued coleco including landlords seeking overdue rent 
and suppliers seeking payment for business forms heating oil and

eastern airlines and its combative machinists union 
are 200 million apart on terms of a new contract according to a 
company negotiator even though the union says it has made a series 
of concessions 
meanwhile the steadily shrinking airline is considering 
abandoning palm beach international airport according to a report 
published friday 
the protracted negotiations between eastern and the machinists 
have prompted the concern of floridas congressional delegation 
which is circulating a letter that would ask the national mediation 
board to expedite the talks 
the letter asks the board to set a definite time frame for 
resolution of the problems according to an aide to rep charles 
bennett a jacksonville fla democrat but does not ask for a 
30day coolingoff period 
easterns negotiators say the unions latest proposal made 
wednesday is disappointing 
in a letter circulated to eastern managers chief negotiator 
thomas matthews claimed the machinists proposal would cost the 
carrier 50 million a year while the company was demanding 160 
million in cost cuts 
the parties are now more than 200 million apart he wrote 
machinists negotiator roy anderson responded that his union has 
made a steady string of concessions in an effort to win a new 
contract but eastern has rejected them 
the machinists latest twoyear proposal calls for a 15 percent 
pay raise in the first year and a 5 percent increase in the second 
year compared with the two 10 percent raises the union asked for 
when the talks began 
anderson said the union also has agreed to more flexible work 
rules and easterns voluntary job retraining program 
the palm beach post reported friday that sources in the eastern 
machinists and pilots unions who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the negotiations include stipulations by eastern that it will 
cut back and perhaps abandon operations at the palm beach airport 
as early as this fall 
easterns gates are the secondbusiest at palm beach 
international where delta air lines carries around 26 percent of 
the passenger traffic and eastern about 23 percent eastern 
operates 14 flights a day out of the airport and increases that 
number by four or five during the winter 
but eastern has been retrenching for the past year pulling out 
of some markets in favor of those areas where business is stronger 
eastern spokesman roger powell said the fall flight schedule 
wont be released for several weeks but that union claims that 
eastern is facing a 20 percent to 25 percent reduction in flight 
hours is probably pretty factual 
surely the fall schedule hasnt been put to bed yet and 
itll probably change 50 times before it is put to bed powell 
said as it now stands we may see a reduction but we have no 
intentions of withdrawing from palm beach 
eastern is a subsidiary of houstonbased texas air corp the 
nations largest airline company

ford motor co said friday it will purchase 108 
acres for possible expansion next to its avon lake ohio truck 
plant which has been suggested as a site for a fordnissan joint 
venture 
ford applied june 2 for an environmental protection agency 
permit to install environmental equipment that would be required 
for expansion or new construction ford spokeswoman judith muhlberg 
said 
epa spokesman allen franks said the agency has conducted an 
initial review of the application but is awaiting further 
information about the project which ford is expected to submit 
within a month 
our engineers are looking at aug 11 to get together and go 
over the additional information and review the full permit 
application franks said if ford decided to go ahead with 
construction it would have to apply for a separate permit to 
operate the equipment 
ford officials declined to give details on the possible 
expansion or new construction saying only that making such an epa 
application is routine when either are being considered because the 
federal process takes so long 
ford and nissan motor co ltd based in japan said earlier this 
year that they had decided to move into the second stage of a study 
of a possible joint venture examining potential plant sites 
vehicles and parts sources 
but ford spokesman jay meisenhelder cautioned against connecting 
the land purchase and the epa application to the joint venture 
often reported to be a fordnissan minivan 
we havent made a decision that theres even going to be a 
joint venture its pure speculation at this point meisenhelder 
said 
ford exercised an option on the land but had yet to close the 
purchase meisenhelder added 
the 1 millionsquarefoot 1500worker avon lake plant builds 
and paints bodies for econoline vans and club wagons the bodies 
are trucked to fords lorain ohio assembly plant where they are 
married to chassis 
the lorain plant is fords largest in the world at 33 million 
square feet muhlberg said it also builds ford thunderbird and 
mercury cougar cars 
ford bought the avon lake site from fruehauf corp in 1972 it 
added 60 acres to its original 170 acres in 1973 the new purchase 
brings the sites total acreage to 338

british aerospace plc will go ahead with its 
takeover of rover group plc despite conditions the european 
commission has imposed on the deal the government said thursday 
the commission on wednesday approved the takeover on the 
condition that the british government cut by 428 million the 
amount of cash the government is to inject simultaneously into the 
stateowned automaker 
trade secretary lord young told the house of lords in an 
emergency statement talks with the european commission this 
morning have clarified the position in terms satisfactory to the 
british aerospace board 
young said that the ec commissioners agreed to requests for 
certain changes in the details of the deals treatment of rover tax 
losses 
british aerospace had reached an agreement with the government 
to acquire its 998percent stake in the automaker for 254 
million at the same time the government had said it would inject 
135 billion into rover to reduce the automakers debt 
but the european economic community commission which has the 
power to block deals that it considers harmful to competition in 
the 12nation common market said wednesday it approved a smaller 
aid package of 793 million 
because some regional aid also would be allowed the state

steel imports surged in may to their highest 
level since july 1986 domestic producers said friday 
an importers association interpreting the same commerce 
department data said however that imports excluding 
semifinished metal bound for processing on american mills were 
held within the limits of the us steel quota system for the first 
five months of the year 
may imports totaled 194 million tons compared with 153 
million tons in april and 185 million tons in may 1987 according 
to the american iron and steel institute 
imports of all steel products including semifinshed ordered by 
us producers totaled 905 million tons up from 84 million tons 
in the comparable 1987 period the washingtonbased aisi said 
these figures reinforce the domestic industrys assertion that 
the system of voluntary restraint agreements which has been in 
effect since october 1984 should be extended for at least another 
five years said the aisi said in a printed statement 
the american producers said the quotas program has fallen 
short of its objective for the almost fouryear period of its 
implementation 
excluding semifinished steel january through may imports 
totaled 78 million tons or 178 percent of apparent domestic 
consumption president reagan set a limit of 185 percent market 
penetration when he initiated the quotas 
american steelmakers imported about 238000 tons out of the 193 
million tons imported in may the new yorkbased aiis said 
steel imports have been a critical support for american steel 
producers who could contiue to meet demand as a result of imported 
steel slab said erwin klein aiis president and vice chairman of 
the importing firm steelinter usa of new york industry and 
government should carefully review the fact that imports relieve

the dollar zoomed to recent highs against 
several major currencies friday on a continuing wave of bullish 
sentiment that overwhelmed heavy selling by central banks around 
the world 
the dollars rise began in foreign markets and was bolstered 
here by the release of the most recent figures on the us trade 
deficit 
so strong was the dollars move the currency managed to finish 
at the highs of the day even after the federal reserve and a host 
of european central banks intervened to subdue its steady climb 
traders speculated the banks collectively may have sold as much as 
2 billion or more 
gold prices were mixed 
the commerce departments report on the merchandise trade 
deficit for may came in at 109 billion supporting views that the 
nations trade imbalance is improving while the figure was up from 
a revised april deficit of 103 billion it was still the second 
smallest in almost three years 
but the dollar did not wait for the release of the trade numbers 
to start moving upward 
it was really uncanny because even before the release of 
the trade numbers we sensed a great deal of buying from europe 
said marc cohen manager of corporate foreign exchange at republic 
national bank in new york 
attributing the dollars rise strictly to the trade report would 
be underplaying the overall positive sentiment toward the dollar 
that sentiment is already built into the market cohen said 
the fact that the market reacted this way to very average 
trade numbers shows the underlying shift toward the dollar he 
added 
further supporting the dollar was a labor department report that 
said the producer price index rose a modest 04 percent in june 
traders said the report hinted at increased purchasing power for 
the dollar 
intervention was heavy in both european and domestic dealings 
traders in europe said the swiss dutch belgian british italian 
and swedish central banks joined in when the bundesbank began 
selling dollars 
the fed was actively selling dollars in the domestic market but 
the currency proceeded to pierce key psychological barriers against 
several currencies 
in tokyo where the business day ends as europes begins the 
dollar finished at 13340 yen up 045 yen from thursdays close 
later in london it was quoted at 13535 yen in new york the 
dollar closed at 13545 yen up from 13318 yen on thursday

in new york the dollar put in its best showing since october 
against the pound which cost 16605 far cheaper than thursdays 
16875

international business machines corp said 
friday its secondquarter profit fell 181 percent but would have 
risen 127 percent if not for the expense of a streamlining plan 
investors apparently focusing on evidence that ibm was 
controlling costs better bid the stock up 75 cents to 12550 a 
share in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
its a solid report said steven cohen an analyst for 
gartner group in stamford conn the growth in expenses is 
slowing without these special charges 
last month ibm announced a 600 million plan to consolidate 
manufacturing and headquarters operations that it said would 
probably lead to the resignation or retirement of 3000 to 4000 
employees 
while the company has succeeded in cutting costs it has had 
less luck drumming up more business revenue rose 63 percent in 
the second quarter after an unusual blip of 10 percent growth in 
the first quarter 
our business continues to improve as a result of our actions 
to be more competitive and customer response to our recent product 
announcements has been positive john f akers ibms chairman 
and chief executive said in a statement 
ibm said its profit fell to 964 million or 163 a share from 
118 billion or 195 a share a year earlier revenue rose to 
136 billion from 128 billion a year earlier 
for the first six months of the fiscal year ibm said its profit 
rose 127 percent to 221 billion or 373 a share from 196 
billion or 325 a share a year earlier revenue rose 8 percent 
to 253 billion from 235 billion 
the cost of the restructuring which ibm says will eventually 
benefit its profits was charged to the second quarter and reduced 
earnings for the period by 364 million or 61 cents a share 
earnings for the first quarter of 1988 were restated to reflect 
a change in accounting standards for deferred taxes that change 
added 57 cents a share to firstquarter earnings largely 
offsetting the negative impact of the restructuring charge on 
firsthalf results 
aside from the special charge ibm held the growth in costs and 
expenses to 58 percent in the second quarter less than revenue 
growth cohen said 
he predicted revenue would grow strongly next year with new 
products such as the f series of 3090 mainframe computers the new 
application system400 midrange models and improved operating 
software for its new personal computer line 
its been a tough five years for the company but it looks 
like the pieces have fallen in place for a record 1989 he said 
joseph battipaglia an analyst for gruntal amp co is also 
predicting ibms 1989 earnings per share will exceed the record of 
1077 set in 1984 but he said revenue growth is likely to remain 
subdued 
i think that is a situation that may well be with them until 
the next significant leap in price and performance in the industry 
and we really havent had any he said 
akers in his written statement said our ongoing drive for 
efficiency and competitiveness and our continuing commitment to 
customer partnerships give us confidence for the future

bond prices edged higher in moderate trading 
friday as investors reacted to a surge in the dollar following the 
governments report that the us trade deficit for may had not 
worsened considerably 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose about point or 
about 250 for every 1000 in face amount its yield which moves 
inversely to its price slipped to 914 percent from 917 percent 
late thursday 
long bond prices made the biggest gains but trading in those 
securities was light said william sullivan jr director of money 
market research for dean witter reynolds inc 
the bond market had been sluggish during the week in 
anticipation of three key economic reports on the trade deficit 
producer prices and industrial production all released friday 
morning 
but all of the reports were about as expected and as a result 
had little impact on bond prices analysts said they said bond 
prices got a push however from the dollars rise in foreign 
exchange markets 
there were really no jolts or surprises as far as the economic 
data sullivan said but the international markets interpreted 
the trade figures very bullishly and the dollar moved up smartly 
the dollars firmer trend helped support higher bond prices 
the commerce department reported the deficit widened to 109 
billion in may from a revised april figure of 103 billion 
analysts had expected the trade gap would expand to the 11 
billion area the 109 billion imbalance was the second lowest in 
almost three years 
the continued improved trend in the trade figures and strength 
in the dollar as a result of them have temporarily offset fears of 
higher shortterm interest rates said marshall b front an 
economist at the chicago investment and mutualfund management firm 
of stein roe amp farnham 
a sharp widening of the trade gap in the past has hurt the 
dollar and led to declines in bond prices bond investors fear a 
lower dollar will lead to inflation credittightening by the 
federal reserve and surging interest rates 
a moderate 04 percent rise for june in the governments 
producer price index also boosted investor confidence front said 
bond prices were up modestly reflecting a sense of relief that 
the trade figures and the producer price index didnt provide any 
important shocks and didnt reveal any negatives he said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose about 116 point intermediate maturities 
rose by between point to 732 point and 20year issues were up 
532 point according to the financial information service telerate 
inc 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer was up 161 to 113897 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 065 to 28188

unchanged while dollar bonds were up point trading was moderate

discounted rate of 671 percent for a yield of 691 percent

oregons insurance commissioner on thursday 
rejected batus incs attempted hostile takeover of the oregon unit 
of farmers insurance co 
commissioner ted kulongoski concluded that the proposed buyout 
by batus the us arm of british conglomerate bat industries plc 
inc would affect farmers policyholders adversely and be harmful 
to free competition in the oregon insurance trade 
kulongoski also cited the intention of batus which owns a major 
tobacco company to restrict the nonsmoker policies sold by 
farmers the commissioner said that also would be bad for 
competition 
kulongoskis order can be appealed to the courts 
batus has offered about 45 billion to acquire los 
angelesbased farmers farmers directors have rejected the 
proposal which would require approval of insurance regulators in 
nine states where farmers has units 
californias insurance commissioner also has rejected the 
proposal and arizona has approved it 
the commissioners ruling stated the proposed acquisition 
subjects policyholders and shareholders to substantial risks 
while providing no benefit that farmers does not already enjoy 
he also said the continued denials by bat and batus of the 
known adverse health effects of tobacco smoking and its stated 
intentions of precluding farmers from referring to such health 
effects in its marketing literature do not promote the interest of 
the insurancebuying public 
batus owns brown amp williamson tobacco corp along with 
department store concerns including saks fifth avenue and marshall 
field 
kulongoski said the proposed purchase would increase risks to 
farmers policyholders because of potential judgments over 
liability lawsuits involving tobacco products

proposed financing of the acquisition is unworkable 
and he said the takeover would be detrimental to free 
competition in the oregon insurance marketplace
